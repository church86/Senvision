By Leslie P. Norton Biography August 6, 2011 Murray Stahl, the chief investment officer of New York-based Horizon Kinetics, began his career as a utility analyst. In the early 1980s, Stahl, a value investor, recommended buying shares of out-of-favor General Public Utilities, then the owner of Three Mile Island, which in 1979 had been the site of the U.S.'s worst nuclear power accident. Investors who heeded his advice made big money. Thus began a career of independent thinking about the market and a wide-ranging interest in what makes successful people tick. He shares these views with his investors, and also with subscribers to Horizon publications such as The Spin-off Report and ETF Compendium. (For a taste, check the "Research Library" tab at www.horizonkinetics.com). Last week, Stahl talked with Barron's about exchange-traded funds, the importance of qualitative insights -- and of course, about stocks. Barron's: Why are exchange-traded funds so important to a stockpicker? Stahl: ETFs are affecting the market in bizarre ways. In order to talk about that, I have to first define a term: owner-operator. Owner-operators are equities where the management happens to be the largest shareholders. That is how they become the management. The wealth of the proprietors is tied into the company. If the shareholder isn't successful, the proprietor can't be financially successful. That is what an owner-operator is. Enlarge Image Close "If management gets their shares for free, I hardly think their interests are aligned" with those of other shareholders. —Murray Stahl Matthew Furhman for Barron's Jeremy Siegel in The Future for Investors studies the IPO market and rightly concludes that initial public offerings have a predictive tendency to produce unsatisfactory results in comparison to different indices. He gives you a table of IPOs that were very successful. It is a minority. Each and every one is owner-operated. Boards give managers shares. That's the crucial operative term, "give shares." Other shareholders had to buy their shares. If management gets their shares for free, I hardly think their interests are aligned. They have a variety of modalities for increasing their wealth, one of which happens to be the shares. I only have one favorable outcome; they have many. ETFs are largely constructed on a market-capitalization-weight, float-adjusted basis. It's never this obvious, but consider a company where management owns a lot of stock and is buying more. At the margin, the stock's weighting in the exchange-traded fund would be reduced. Why? Assuming everything else remains the same, the float is being reduced. Let's take the other extreme case, in which management has sold all their shares. From an ETF perspective, the float increased. Therefore, its weight in the index would more nearly approximate its market capitalization. The exchange-traded fund structure de facto does the opposite of what the insiders do. I find that rather intriguing. What are the ramifications? To begin with, owner-operated companies trade at very low valuations. Eventually, the market corrects that. A more major consequence is that if you examine the S&P 500 since 1957, and the exercise was to find the best stocks, you'd find Wal-Mart WMT -1.5344528083381586% Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

Now let's perform the exercise of calculating the S&P as if those companies never existed and were never in it. I promise you that you would never buy the resulting rump S&P, which would probably have returned half of what it was historically. We looked at the 80 owner-operators in Japan and compared them to the three primary indexes: the MSCI Japan, the Topix and the Nikkei. The difference in return was significant per annum. The individual investor should understand that, historically, indexation provided the rates of return it did because of the presence of a given number of owner-operators. Are you saying that individuals shouldn't be in exchange-traded funds? No. Indexation is a very sound idea. I'm really saying that someone should design an ETF that incorporates consciously the owner-operator element. "How They Did It" is a fascinating section in your publications that profiles successful people. Whom did you find most useful? When I went to college, I was interested in economics because as a very naïve person I thought I would learn to make money from the masters. I was absolutely aghast when I learned most of the masters were broke. Karl Marx was destitute most of his life, and if Friedrich Engels hadn't provided financial assistance, who knows what would have happened? There's an apocryphal remark from Marx's wife: "If Karl Marx invested more time into making Das Kapital than writing Das Kapital, his family would have been better off." So I decided to read the lives of people who were financially successful. It is the most interesting part of the whole field of finance. Benjamin Franklin stands head and shoulders above everyone else. For example, during the time of the French and Indian Wars, the Assembly of Philadelphia felt the city might be attacked. But Philadelphia was a Quaker city, and the Quakers were uninterested in violence. Franklin asked if they were opposed to storing grain, because the granaries might be burned in an invasion. They said, "Of course not," and donated money for grain. He went and bought gunpowder on the premise that it's a grainy substance. He wanted to buy artillery from the governor of New York, who wouldn't sell. So Franklin invited him to dinner. He wrote, "After the first bottle of Madeira, I had my first cannon. After the second I had several more. Had I stayed, I could have had them all." Eugene Meyer had very useful insights. He bought 51% of Boston Consolidated, which owned the worst-managed copper mining properties in 1907 or 1908, for one reason: It controlled the upper half of a mountain in Utah and the Guggenheim family controlled the bottom half. They had the technology to extract copper from low-grade ores, which they wouldn't share with Consolidated. But you can't mine the bottom half of a mountain without having the cooperation of the people who own the top half, unless you're not worried about things like avalanches and cave-ins. That's not an asset you find on a balance sheet. Frequently, the qualitative dimension is more important than the quantitative. The insights of most of these people are completely qualitative, rarely properly digested by the market. You've written a lot about unsustainable profitability, but the companies in the S&P 500 are continuing to beat estimates. The stock prices clearly reflect unsustainability. Even the worldwide debt crisis plays a role in the unsustainability. Federal spending since 1933 has grown at 9.03% a year. Sooner or later, governments, to alleviate their distress, might raise taxes. That's another way of achieving lower profit margins. How does the market look to you? The stock market will produce very uninspiring results for many years to come. Part of it is the unsustainability of profit margins. Part of it is the debt crisis. In the S&P, a lot of companies already dominate their industries -- food, utilities, drugs. Companies might acquire competitors. But statistically, most acquisitions aren't well-thought-out. They could return cash to shareholders, but if the yield is 2%-3%, you only get that yield and if you buy back a stock at a P/E of, say, 14 to 15 times, invert that and you get a sevenish percent return. Uninspiring. I invite people to undertake this exercise: Take any stock you like, and instead of buying it, make believe you wrote a put option on it, which gives you the right to sell a security at a predefined price. So you sold a put option with a six-month expiration. What happens? You earn a premium. And let's make believe that the stock was completely unchanged for a year. You wrote a put option collecting a premium, the option expired worthless, and you wrote another premium for the remaining six months. Stahl's Picks Recent Company Ticker Price WisdomTree Investments WETF $6.86 CBOE Holdings CBOE 22.45 Beijing Capital Intl Airport 694.HK HK$3.57 ...And a Pan Carmike Cinemas CKED $6.19 Source: Bloomberg Those two premiums in the case of almost every stock is a double-digit number. Of course, it is never a steady-state world. But assuming it were, the premium of virtually any stock is double-digit—that's the return people want to get from the equity, but might not. Now if the stock price is unchanged, that is the rate of return. If the equity goes up in value, you earn that rate of return. If the equity goes down in value, your underlying position is marked down, but you have the cushion of the premium that you collected. If the premiums over the year totaled 12% or 14%, the stock has to decline by 12% or 14% for you to reach breakeven. Our Kinetics Multi-Disciplinary Fund [KMDNX] pursues this strategy. It is similar to equities in terms of its rate of return, but much less volatile. People are looking for that. It works great in an IRA account, in a foundation, anything tax-exempt. Even on a taxable basis, I dare say it will provide an acceptable rate of return. What do you think of emerging markets? They have been a disappointment over the 25 years I've been investing. I don't think they provide the rate of return that justifies the risk. A well-managed emerging- market fund probably returned 12-ish percent over 20 to 25 years. If you're a taxable individual living in the State of New York, if your net after-tax result were in the single digits, would you invest? Most people would decline. The maximum corporate profits are earned when there is little competition. Look at any emerging-market index and see how many companies populate any industry group, with more on the way. I suppose, compared with the uninspiring U.S. equity market, emerging markets look very good. But would I buy an emerging-markets index? No. But there might be splendid emerging-market companies that provide truly unique rates of return. In that case, investment is warranted. Let's talk about stocks. What do you like? I am a big investor in WisdomTree Investments WETF 1.0392609699769053% WisdomTree Investments Inc.

It's better to invest in the ETF company as a business than in exchange-traded funds themselves. WisdomTree is exploring interesting new opportunities, like emerging-currency and debt funds, short-term investments with higher yields and undervalued currencies. WisdomTree's earnings-weighted exchange-traded funds make more sense than the market-capitalization-weighted ETFs. When I bought it, the company traded for roughly 3% of assets under management. It now trades at 7%. I think it will be acquired in a couple of years by a large mutual-fund complex or bank or brokerage that would like to be in exchange-traded funds and wants a revenue stream. Individuals are very unlikely to return to traditional mutual-fund investing where you can exit the investment only after 4 p.m. There are only a handful of large ETF companies. WisdomTree is eighth on the list. The market cap is around $800 million. WisdomTree has minimal earnings. It has invested virtually all of its cash flow into growing the business. The company is now at $13.3 billion of assets, versus less than $4 billion a year ago. If the average fee is 55 basis points [hundredths of a percentage point], that's $70 million of fee income that could become $70 million of operating income on an existing platform. You are paying $800 million for $70 million of income with very high growth rates. An informed buyer might pay $14 or $15 a share.

Why? CBOE just announced July volume up 13%. The operative thing is to look at the volume of the VIX [volatility] contract. The VIX is the company's most valuable asset, only about 2% of volume, but growing 334% a year. In the fullness of time, about three or four years from now, the vehicle of choice for hedging a portfolio will not be the S&P 500 futures contract; it will be the VIX because it's so much more volatile than the S&P. This is a very unique exchange. It has proprietary properties like the VIX and is using that to branch into other volatility trades like the gold VIX, a recent creation that ultimately will probably be successful as well. But that VIX contract is extremely valuable. It has first-mover advantage. I think it is worth in three to four years more than the whole CBOE. The company trades at 15 times earnings; that's not a bargain. The issue is that ultimately it will produce a great deal of earnings. Beijing Capital International Airports [694.Hong Kong] is like CBOE in that both have very little in the way of variable cost. If 10,000 more passengers come into the airport, if someone trades an extra 10,000 VIX contracts, the cost of operating doesn't go up. Prior to 2008, the airport was very profitable. Then it doubled in size and more than doubled operating expenses. Passenger traffic went up, so the airport was more or less breakeven. It has a high growth rate. They're at the stage where increased passenger throughput goes to the bottom line. They preannounced earnings that are vastly higher than forecasts. It trades at 20 times. To judge its future profitability, compare it to Australian-listed MAp Airports, which owns 30%-plus of the Brussels and Copenhagen airports and 74% of Sydney. Its proportion of the traffic is about 40 million passengers a year. Now the Beijing Airport gets more than 70 million passengers a year. MAp's fixed costs are much lower than Beijing's. MAp's airports earn $400 million a year. Beijing Airports earns something like $100 million, but once it achieves the proper economies of scale, it will earn much more than MAp. MAp has a market cap of roughly about $6 billion. And Beijing has a market cap of $2 billion. I think it's worth more than MAp. Anything you dislike? Carmike Cinemas [CKEC]. The average ticket price is increasing at a small rate each year, but attendance is declining 1% to 2% a year, and rents go up every year with a 3% escalator. We're at a point where given competition and other venues of entertainment, it's very hard to raise prices. Margins are razor thin. I think the profitability goes away in 24 months or less.

Apparently, Kim’s sobriety is being called into question again after new housewife Eden Sassoon started talking about her own experiences with alcoholism, overdoses, and losing her sister. And this was probably the last thing she wanted to focus on as she was planning her big party. According to a new tweet, Kyle Richards revealed that she was a bit stressed out over the party as some of the pieces weren’t falling into place. In addition, Richards knew that Eden might confront her sister about some of the things that were said behind her back. While Kyle wanted to keep the peace with her sister, one can imagine she had a lot going on. And this resulted in a cringeworthy moment for Kyle Richards. “I love you, but complaining about a Walmart being nearby at your party is a little cringeworthy…I’m a target person though!” one person wrote to Kyle on Twitter after watching Tuesday’s episode of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, where Richards questioned her party planner about a Walmart being nearby where she was hosting her party. Don't miss tonight's #rhobh & our Great Gatsby party ???????????? thank you @david_meister for my dress!! A photo posted by Kyle Richards Umansky (@kylerichards18) on Jan 31, 2017 at 3:45pm PST Kyle’s expression was one of surprise and skepticism. And while some people saw her reaction as being one of shock that a Walmart would be near her fancy party, others saw her reaction as one of confusion. Was there a Walmart near her that she didn’t know about? Her reaction caused some discussion on Twitter as some people thought that Kyle was implying she was too good for Walmart and hinting that she was better than people who shopped there. But as it turns out, this was not the case. “You misunderstood. I WANTED one. Just didn’t believe there is one b/c I’ve never seen one around here,” Kyle Richards explained on Twitter, sharing that she would love to have a Walmart nearby where the party was because she loves shopping there. As it turns out, Kyle Richards was just confused as she hadn’t seen a Walmart near there, so when the party planner suggested going to Walmart to pick up some last minute supplies, Richards was just confused as to what location he was referring to. As it turns out, Kyle would have probably gone with him. But maybe Richards had other things to worry about other than locating the nearest Walmart. Just days prior, she had learned that Eden Sassoon was talking about Kim Richards and her sobriety behind her back. While Kyle didn’t want to say anything, she was nervous about Sassoon confronting Kim at her own party, and she was surprised when Eden approached them to have a conversation. Bumped into @doritkemsley at @accesshollywood this morning. Discussing #rhobh & #celebapprentice tune into #rhobh tonight at 9:00 @bravotv A photo posted by Kyle Richards Umansky (@kylerichards18) on Jan 17, 2017 at 8:29pm PST “Eden and PK rode with us and some of our friends. Dorit lets me know that Eden said I enable Kim. I know Lisa Rinna said that before, so is that why Eden said that? Nobody who has uttered the word “enabler ” has ever witnessed any enabling. I resent having to defend myself against something so far from the truth. I’m not allowing it to ruin my night though. I’ve been so excited about this party that I’m basically letting it go in one ear and out the other,” Kyle Richards explains in her Bravo blog about the confrontation, shifting her focus from her sister to the property. “The house and party looked beautiful. Yes, I was nervous about the cold weather and a few things, but it all turned out great. I always torture my party planner Glenn Schneider.

An Ottawa school bus driver has been fired after she left a busload of children in a Walmart parking lot while she went inside the store. Ottawa Student Transportation Authority (OSTA) general manager Vicky Kyriaco told CBC News the driver, who was driving children home from Cedarview Middle School, didn't follow proper procedure when she made the pit stop Thursday afternoon. OSTA general manager Vicky Kyriaco says the driver was fired for failing to follow proper procedure. (Waubgeshig Rice/CBC) According to OSTA, the driver turned off the ignition and went into the Walmart store at Strandherd and Longfields drives in Barrhaven for about 20 minutes. The children on the bus, which was full at the time, range in age from 11 to 14. Kyriaco said it appears the driver was experiencing some sort of "emergency," but the precise reason for the stop isn't clear. 'We want to make sure that [parents] know this isn't going to happen again.' - Vicki Kyriaco, OSTA "Certainly everyone has their own personal health circumstances that might require a pit stop, but no matter what, there should always be communication with the operator," Kyriaco said. "There are alternate options certainly to make sure the students are safe and that we also deal with the driver's needs." According to OSTA procedure, a driver who has to leave children on a bus for whatever reason must contact the dispatcher to ensure the safety of the passengers, said Kyriaco. The driver did not follow procedure in this case. Principal notified parents Brian Begbie, principal of Cedarview Middle School, sent an email to parents of the children on route V158 Friday afternoon. In it, Begbie quotes a letter he received from OSTA: "Some students have reported that their bus driver parked their bus at a Walmart before completing her run, yesterday. According to these students, the driver left students unattended on the bus for a period of approximately 20 minutes. The driver had turned the bus off and removed the keys. "No injuries have been reported. We are committed to ensuring the safety of your children and wanted you to know that there had been unusual circumstances with your child's trip home yesterday." Driver 'removed' "OSTA and the Operator have conducted an investigation. It has been concluded that the driver was not authorized to stop and did not communicate her intentions appropriately. She has been removed from this route and will no longer be driving any OSTA routes."  Kyriaco said she found out about the situation Friday morning and took immediate action to safeguard student safety. "We want parents to understand that we really are committed to the safety of their children while they're riding the bus. We want to make sure that they know this isn't going to happen again. And, at the time, they were in a secured vehicle. They were safe and they'll continue to be riding on a safe bus."

(David Thurton/ CBC News) A class-action lawsuit filed against Walmart Canada Corp. is seeking $10 million in damages on behalf of customers who purchased contaminated food at a Fort McMurray Walmart after last year's wildfire. Calgary-based Higgerty Law filed a statement of claim in Edmonton Court of Queen's Bench on Feb. 3. It seeks compensation for Alberta consumers who purchased or consumed products from Walmart's Fort McMurray location. The action relates "to the negligent and irresponsible" sale and provision of consumer goods "which were unfit for human use or consumption following the Fort McMurray wildfires in 2016, due to smoke and toxin contamination." The lawsuit follows action taken by Alberta Health Services in January against Walmart. AHS filed 174 Public Health Act charges against the company in relation to the alleged sale of wildfire-contaminated products and goods. Court documents show the alleged health act violations occurred at the Walmart outlet on Hospital Street between May 24 and May 29, 2016. Law firm considers class-action suit against Walmart for allegedly selling wildfire-contaminated food Walmart faces 174 charges related to sale of fire-contaminated food The lawsuit seeks damages on behalf of several groups: People who purchased contaminated products or goods but didn't consume them and didn't receive a full refund; People who purchased uncontaminated products and disposed of them after becoming aware of the risk of contamination but did not receive a full refund, and; People who used or consumed contaminated products or goods and experienced "resulting illness, damages for any out-of-pocket medical expenses, damages for lost wages, damages for any future care expense, and damages for pain and suffering." "Our clients are concerned that their families' health may have been compromised," co-counsel Patrick Higgerty said in a news release Friday. "While the full scope of the health impact on the affected families is not yet known, we will be seeking damages to compensate everyone affected. Consumers who have called us are universal in their call for the facts to be revealed and those accountable be held responsible." Clint Docken with Higgerty Law said five people have signed up for the class action and they're still accepting more claimants. William Young, a warehouse technician at the Sears store in Fort McMurray, is the representative plaintiff in the lawsuit. In the news release from Higgerty Law, Young said he was "one of the essential personnel who came back early to help in the recovery process." The statement of claim says Young purchased various products including eggs, sausages, milk, energy drinks and water between May 25, 2016, and May 29, 2016. "Walmart needs to be held accountable for directly putting us in danger, and for not implementing a better plan of action in the wake of such disasters," Young said in the news release. "We'd like to see that this doesn't happen again, and we'd like to be compensated for the damages we have accumulated as a result of Walmart's negligence." None of the allegations in the statement of claim have been proven. Walmart hasn't responded to CBC's request for comment. A court has not certified the class-action.  Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Weather Severe weather warnings or watches in effect for: Saturday Mainly sunny 0°C Sunday Sunny 6°C Monday Sunny 4°C Tuesday Sunny 4°C Wednesday Sunny 11°C More Weather | | Latest Edmonton News Headlines Job losses not responsible for Edmonton's rising unemployment rate, city economist says ATCO faces $10M lawsuit for explosion at Fort McMurray home Edmonton woman can't communicate with unconscious father's doctors in Turkey Silver Skate Festival returns to the river valley video Vince Li, man who beheaded passenger on Greyhound bus, given absolute discharge Edmonton Index Promos Spruce Grove, Parkland County get more bus routes to Edmonton Mother of Canadian killed fighting ISIS questions delay in returning son's body Alberta carbon tax rebates too generous, says Alberta Party Battle against fentanyl must include input from drug users, says former drug user Top News Headlines Community leader in Minnesota 'overwhelmed' with calls from Somalis aiming to walk across Canadian border video Vince Li, man who beheaded passenger on Greyhound bus, given absolute discharge Trump considers signing a 'brand new order' on immigration read comments 'It was my choice to make:' Over boos from crowd, Trudeau says electoral reform scuttled for national unity read comments video 'Hunting is not about killing for me': Trophy hunter sees shooting big game as form of conservation read comments video Most Viewed Storm of reaction to news Syrian refugee charged with sex assaults 'A dream for everybody who wrestles': Alberta man makes debut on WWE Raw ATCO faces $10M lawsuit for explosion at Fort McMurray home Job losses not responsible for Edmonton's rising unemployment rate, city economist says Edmonton woman can't communicate with unconscious father's doctors in Turkey Lawsuit seeks $10M damages for Walmart consumers after Fort McMurray wildfire 'Can you hear me?': New phone scam tricks you into answering 'yes' Alberta family escapes house fire after cat wakes owner Teenage girls touched at WEM water park, man charged with 6 counts of sexual assault Don't Miss Luggage mangled on Air Canada flight 'looked like it was out of a war zone' Post-fire construction boom in Fort McMurray expected to surpass height of oilsands frenzy Video Red Deer man punches cougar at Tim Hortons to save dog YEAR IN REVIEW Edmonton's best restaurants 2016 Exclusive Son caught Edmonton mother fatally stabbing her daughter, police sources say Video Syrian family's arrival at Edmonton airport becomes music jam session Explore CBC CBC Home TV Radio News Sports Music Life Arts Kids Local Documentaries Comedy Books Parents Indigenous Digital Archives Games Contests Site Map Stay Connected Apps RSS Podcasts Newsletters & Alerts Services and Information Corporate Info Public Appearances Commercial Services Reuse & Permission Terms of Use Privacy Policy CBC Shop Help Contact Us Jobs Doing Business with Us Renting Facilities CBC Radio-Canada ©2017 CBC/Radio-Canada.

Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) Feb 10, 2017 at 12:23PM It's no secret that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a dominant force in online retail. But it's still astounding just how dominant it's been in recent years. New data from Slice Intelligence shows Amazon took 53% of all the sales growth of online retailers in the US last year. Amazon's North American sales increased 25.2% in 2016. Meanwhile, the U.S. Census Bureau has been tracking e-commerce sales growth around 15.5% through the first three quarters of the year. Put another way, despite its size, Amazon continues to take share of the growing e-commerce market, and competitors such as Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) are struggling to keep up. Image source: Amazon.com. $53 billion in retail sales up for grabs While the U.S. Census Bureau hasn't released its estimates for the fourth quarter of 2016 yet, extrapolating out the steady growth rate of the first three quarters results in $53 billion in online sales for 2016. In addition, the majority of retail growth in the United States comes from e-commerce. In 2015, 62% of total growth came from online sales. Slice's numbers may be a bit off, considering Amazon saw an increase of "just" $16 billion in sales across all of North America. Still, the company is undoubtedly taking market share as its sales growth outpaces the overall industry. With e-commerce accounting for such a significant share of retail growth in the United States, Amazon's biggest competitors, like Wal-Mart, are really feeling the hurt. While Amazon's North American sales increased 25.2% last year, Wal-Mart's overall U.S. sales increased just 3.3% through the first three quarters of the year. Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales fared a bit better, increasing 7%, 11.8%, and 20.6% in the first, second, and third quarters, respectively. The third quarter was boosted by the acquisition of Jet.com. Overall, Wal-Mart's organic e-commerce sales still appear to lag the industry. How is Amazon dominating retail? Even if you're skeptical of Slice's claim that Amazon took 53% of online sales growth last year, it's clear that Amazon accounts for a huge share of the retail growth in the United States. Not just e-commerce growth, but overall retail sales. Slice had a few thoughts to share on why Amazon has been able to stay ahead of the competition: Faster shipping. Amazon's average ship time fell about 1.5 days over the past two years, and it remains more than two days faster than the average competitor, according to Slice's data. Wal-Mart recently started offering free two-day shipping on about 2 million select items, but its selection pales in comparison with the 50 million Prime-eligible items on Amazon. Subscriptions. Amazon's subscribe-and-save feature allows customers to automatically reorder a product, receive free shipping, and get a discount to boot. That's quite an incentive to become a repeat customer. Ease of ordering. Products such as Amazon's Echo smart speaker or its Dash buttons make ordering products from Amazon easier than putting on pants -- the very pants I ordered from Amazon. Undoubtedly, however, the biggest factor fueling Amazon's continued dominance of retail in the United States is its Prime program. Prime makes customers extremely loyal. It's what fuels 55% of online shoppers to check Amazon.com first (and maybe last). And it causes shoppers to spend more on Amazon than their non-Prime counterparts. Last year, Amazon added "tens of millions" of new Prime members, according to its fourth-quarter earnings release. Unlike the previous two years, when Amazon experienced around 50% annual growth in membership, the company didn't provide a growth rate. That may be because Prime membership is nearing saturation in markets such as the United States. Estimates show more than half of U.S. households are already Prime members. Still, with a growing majority of households subscribed to Prime (even if that growth is slowing) and going to Amazon as their first online shopping destination, it looks as if Amazon will continue to take share of the U.S. retail market for the foreseeable future.

Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) Feb 10, 2017 at 12:23PM It's no secret that Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a dominant force in online retail. But it's still astounding just how dominant it's been in recent years. New data from Slice Intelligence shows Amazon took 53% of all the sales growth of online retailers in the US last year. Amazon's North American sales increased 25.2% in 2016. Meanwhile, the U.S. Census Bureau has been tracking e-commerce sales growth around 15.5% through the first three quarters of the year. Put another way, despite its size, Amazon continues to take share of the growing e-commerce market, and competitors such as Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) are struggling to keep up. Image source: Amazon.com. $53 billion in retail sales up for grabs While the U.S. Census Bureau hasn't released its estimates for the fourth quarter of 2016 yet, extrapolating out the steady growth rate of the first three quarters results in $53 billion in online sales for 2016. In addition, the majority of retail growth in the United States comes from e-commerce. In 2015, 62% of total growth came from online sales. Slice's numbers may be a bit off, considering Amazon saw an increase of "just" $16 billion in sales across all of North America. Still, the company is undoubtedly taking market share as its sales growth outpaces the overall industry. With e-commerce accounting for such a significant share of retail growth in the United States, Amazon's biggest competitors, like Wal-Mart, are really feeling the hurt. While Amazon's North American sales increased 25.2% last year, Wal-Mart's overall U.S. sales increased just 3.3% through the first three quarters of the year. Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales fared a bit better, increasing 7%, 11.8%, and 20.6% in the first, second, and third quarters, respectively. The third quarter was boosted by the acquisition of Jet.com. Overall, Wal-Mart's organic e-commerce sales still appear to lag the industry. How is Amazon dominating retail? Even if you're skeptical of Slice's claim that Amazon took 53% of online sales growth last year, it's clear that Amazon accounts for a huge share of the retail growth in the United States. Not just e-commerce growth, but overall retail sales. Slice had a few thoughts to share on why Amazon has been able to stay ahead of the competition: Faster shipping. Amazon's average ship time fell about 1.5 days over the past two years, and it remains more than two days faster than the average competitor, according to Slice's data. Wal-Mart recently started offering free two-day shipping on about 2 million select items, but its selection pales in comparison with the 50 million Prime-eligible items on Amazon. Subscriptions. Amazon's subscribe-and-save feature allows customers to automatically reorder a product, receive free shipping, and get a discount to boot. That's quite an incentive to become a repeat customer. Ease of ordering. Products such as Amazon's Echo smart speaker or its Dash buttons make ordering products from Amazon easier than putting on pants -- the very pants I ordered from Amazon. Undoubtedly, however, the biggest factor fueling Amazon's continued dominance of retail in the United States is its Prime program. Prime makes customers extremely loyal. It's what fuels 55% of online shoppers to check Amazon.com first (and maybe last). And it causes shoppers to spend more on Amazon than their non-Prime counterparts. Last year, Amazon added "tens of millions" of new Prime members, according to its fourth-quarter earnings release. Unlike the previous two years, when Amazon experienced around 50% annual growth in membership, the company didn't provide a growth rate. That may be because Prime membership is nearing saturation in markets such as the United States. Estimates show more than half of U.S. households are already Prime members. Still, with a growing majority of households subscribed to Prime (even if that growth is slowing) and going to Amazon as their first online shopping destination, it looks as if Amazon will continue to take share of the U.S. retail market for the foreseeable future.

Yet it popped up in a recent screen for companies poised to benefit from sweeping corporate tax changes proposed by the U.S. House of Representatives. (And Regeneron shares popped Thursday.) On the other hand, Deere (DE) is up 22% over that stretch, yet it screens as a company that could get pinched by the new tax plan. It’s early to speculate on precisely how corporate taxes will change. But Donald Trump is reportedly warming to a House plan...

Instead, the retailer is offering free two-day shipping without a membership fee on as many as two million items, lowering the minimum purchase required for free shipping to $35 from $50. All current ShippingPass members will receive a refund on their membership.   "In today's world of e-commerce, two-day free shipping is table stakes," Marc Lore, President and CEO, Walmart U.S. eCommerce wrote on the retailer's blog. "It no longer makes sense to charge for it."   While the two million items that qualify for two-day shipping "make up the vast majority of what customers buy online," according to Lore, Amazon's marketplace offers at least 30 million products available through Amazon prime in comparison.   Lore remains positive about customer-centric changes the retail is working towards, writing "I’ve been here for four months and I couldn’t be more excited about how fast we are moving. It feels like a startup. We’ve rolled out a new leadership team and organizational structure that’s highly customer centric. We’ve got everybody working on new ways to serve our customers."

By Ben White and Mary Lee 02/10/17 08:00 AM EST WHITE HOUSE PUSHES TRUMP INC. — Isaac Arnsdorf, Josh Dawsey and I look at the remarkable extent to which the White House is willing to promote Trump family brands, from the president’s Mar-a-Lago club to Ivanka Trump’s clothing and accessories business. White House adviser Kellyanne Conway on Wednesday took the remarkable step of public urging people to buy Ivanka Trump’s goods following the flap with Nordstrom. She did so from the White House, a clear violation of federal ethics rules. Nothing is likely to happen to Conway because her boss probably enjoyed the comments and the Office of Government Ethics has no real power to impose any punishment. One unfortunate part of all this for Ivanka Trump is she really has nothing to do with any of it. Story Continued Below From the piece: “People close to Ivanka Trump say there is no way for her to fully divest from her branded products business because she owns it all herself and would have to shut down her company in order to eliminate any perceptions of conflicts. And they say she cannot do that because of existing multi-year contracts with various retail outlets and other partners. “Defenders say that Ivanka Trump would never discuss anything related to her personal businesses with the various CEOs who attend White House meetings or private dinners with her. This includes Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon who attended a recent dinner. Wal-Mart carries Ivanka Trump products. Some on Wall Street have also speculated about potential conflicts given all the financial executives who attend meetings with the first daughter. The list of finance executives who have attended meetings with her include investment banker Adebayo Ogunlesi, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Critics say this could raise the possibility of financiers providing favorable credit terms to Ivanka Trump for her various business endeavors. But people close to Trump say she has no lenders to her businesses and no debt. “She doesn’t owe anyone anything,” one person close to Trump said. Read more. TRUMP SMACKED DOWN BY APPEALS COURT — POLITICO’s Josh Gerstein: “A federal appeals court has turned down President Donald Trump’s attempt to revive his controversial travel ban executive order. A three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously rejected the Justice Department’s request to lift a Seattle-based judge’s restraining order that blocked authorities from carrying out the limits Trump sought to impose on travel to the U.S. by refugees and by citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries. “The White House could take the issue to the Supreme Court, but the prospects for such an appeal are uncertain due in part to the high court being short a justice and split evenly between Democratic and Republican appointed justices.” Read more. TRUMP RESPONSE — Via Twitter: “SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE.” ABA FILES SUIT OVER FED DIVIDENDS — ABA President Rob Nichols and Washington Federal CEO Roy Whitehead in a WSJ op-ed: “Legal action against the government is always a last resort, yet it’s one that we must turn to when alternatives are unavailable and matters of principle are at stake. “That’s the situation in which America’s bankers find themselves today. In 2016 the government wrongfully withheld $1.1 billion in contracted dividend payments to the industry, reducing the money that banks use to make job-creating loans and investments in our hometowns. That amount will balloon to $17 billion over the next 10 years for all affected banks” Read more. The lawsuit is here. RUH ROH — WP’s By Greg Miller, Adam Entous and Ellen Nakashima: “National security adviser Michael Flynn privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador to the United States during the month before President Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Trump officials, current and former U.S. officials said. “Flynn’s communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were interpreted by some senior U.S. officials as an inappropriate and potentially illegal signal to the Kremlin that it could expect a reprieve from sanctions that were being imposed by the Obama administration in late December to punish Russia for its alleged interference in the 2016 election” Read more. FSR IS MAKING A LIST, CHECKING IT TWICE — POLITICO’s Victoria Guida and Zachary Warmbrodt: “The Financial Services Roundtable on Friday morning released its wish list for 2017. At the top: changing the structure of the CFPB to a commission; repeal of the Durbin amendment, which limits the fees that financial institutions can impose on debit card transactions; and setting capital standards based on risk rather than simply size, FSR President Tim Pawlenty told POLITICO “The organization would also like to see a more coordinated approach to cybersecurity regulations across agencies, as well as progress toward the white whale known as reform of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Read their overall priorities here, on cybersecurity here, and on housing here. TOOMEY TO YELLEN: DROP STRESS TESTS — POLITICO’s Zachary Warmbrodt: “Sen. Pat Toomey told Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen in a letter this week that the central bank should stop stress tests of the country’s biggest lenders. The Pennsylvania Republican said the Fed’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review process was hampering lending, adding to compliance costs and increasing systemic dangers” See the letter.

Consumer Sentiment at 10:00 a.m. expected to dip to 97.9 from 98.5. PURDUE OPPOSES BAT — Sen. David Purdue (R-Ga.) in a Wash. Times op-ed: “[T]he fourth idea being crammed into this comprehensive proposal by the House is the so-called ‘border adjustment tax.’ This 20 percent tax on all imports is regressive, hammers consumers, shuts down economic growth, and is proven to grow the federal government. “Increased consumer prices would hammer consumer confidence and lower overall demand, thus putting downward pressure on jobs. This is exactly the wrong approach. Why would we do this at a time when millions of Americans are struggling to get from payday to payday?” Read more. ** A message from American Bankers Association: The Durbin Amendment, which imposed government price caps on debit card interchange rates, was supposed to help consumers. Instead, it poured $42 billion into big-box stores’ pockets and left customers empty-handed. Government price controls are a lose-lose for Americans. Let’s repeal the Durbin Amendment. www.aba.com/RepealDurbin ** CHINA-U.S. RELATIONS FROZEN — NYT’s Mark Landler and Michael Forsythe: “When the White House announced this week that President Trump had sent President Xi Jinping of China a letter wishing him a happy Chinese New Year, it did not disclose a major reason for the friendly gesture: Mr. Xi has not gotten on the phone with Mr. Trump. “Stung by Mr. Trump’s unorthodox telephone call with the president of Taiwan and his subsequent assertion that the United States might no longer abide by the ‘One China’ policy, Mr. Xi has not spoken to Mr. Trump since Nov. 14, the week after he was elected. Administration officials say they believe he will only do so after Mr. Trump publicly commits to recognizing a single Chinese government in Beijing.” Read more. FREEZE BROKEN — FT’s Demetri Sevastopulo: “Trump has told Chinese President Xi Jinping that the White House will respect the ‘One China’ policy, in a move that will ease tensions between the powers, according to two people familiar with the call. In his first conversation with the Chinese leader since entering the Oval Office, Mr Trump said he would abide by the diplomatic formula that Beijing and Taipei agreed in 1992.” Read more. MORE ON THE HENSARLING MEMO — Cowen’s Jaret Seiberg: “We believe this measure would offer relief to the banks, but do not see how it could pass the Senate. As a result, our view remains that banks will enjoy the most upside from the new regulatory focus that will exist once Trump installs his own people at the Federal Reserve, CFPB, FDIC and OCC. … “To us, the issue is not whether the House could pass such a bill. That seems to be a given. It is how to get such a measure through the Senate. Our view is that Democrats will not support such a material approach to changing the rules for bigger banks. And there is little probability they would support changes to the CFPB's authority. This is why we believe this bill is more about sending a message on how the GOP wants to change the law.” Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform: “This awful bill has always been a giveaway to Wall Street, and if anything it appears to be getting worse. It would hack away at crucial rules that prevent reckless banks from blowing up the financial system and the broader economy.” Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), ranking member of Senate Banking: “It took less than three weeks for House Republicans to show their hand on how they will renege on candidate Trump’s campaign promises to hold Wall Street accountable and help working Americans.” ABE-TRUMP PREVIEW — Bloomberg’s Margaret Talev: “Trump’s accusations of currency manipulation against Japan aren’t a priority for him in talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe planned for Friday, an administration official said. “The automobile industry will be an important topic in the talks, the official said. The official declined to address specifics about it or how the president would approach discussions on import taxes.” Read more. KUSHNER FAMILY DEAL — NYT’s Andrew Ross Sorkin and Michael J. De La Merced: “The Kushners, the New York real estate family whose scion is a close adviser to President Trump, are in negotiations to buy the Miami Marlins baseball team, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. “The Kushners — led by Joshua Kushner, a venture capitalist, and Joseph Meyer, his brother-in-law and key lieutenant for the family’s investments — have pursued the Marlins for several months, devising a complicated financial arrangement that would include bringing in partners later, these people said. Mr. Kushner is the younger brother of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law.” Read more. CEA DEMOTED — WSJ’s Josh Zumbrun reports: “The White House Council of Economic Advisers is being demoted by the Trump administration, which said in a statement Wednesday that the president’s cabinet won't include the chairman of the CEA, an official that President Donald Trump also has yet to name. “The diminished stature for the CEA, which was part of President Barack Obama’s cabinet and has advised presidents for over seven decades on the economic impact of their policies, means Mr. Trump will likely rely more heavily on other advisers, such as Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs president who is head of the National Economic Council, and Peter Navarro, the trade critic who is leading the National Trade Council.” Read more. NAMES FOR CFPB HEAD — CNBC’s Ylan Mui reports: “The White House is considering a top official at Fannie Mae to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, according to two people familiar with the discussion. “Brian Brooks is currently the mortgage financing giant's general counsel and has close ties to Treasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin. Brooks represented several of the investors in Mnuchin's purchase of failed subprime mortgage lender IndyMac for $1.6 billion in 2009. The bank was renamed OneWest, and Brooks joined the company as vice chairman.” Read more. #3 JOB IN DOJ — Bloomberg’s Tom Schoenberg reports: “The new U.S. attorney general, Jeff Sessions, spent most of his Senate confirmation hearing answering questions about his civil rights record. The fate of remaining Justice Department probes of banks’ complicity in the financial crisis, though, may fall to a lawyer who spent much of the Obama administration representing the interests of banks and other corporations. “Trump last week nominated Rachel L. Brand, 43, a onetime senior counsel at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, to become associate attorney general, the No. 3 job in the Justice Department. The position, which requires Senate confirmation, supervises the civil, antitrust and environmental divisions, among others, making it an important overseer of many of the department’s probes of corporations.” Read more. TWITTER’S NEW AD STRATEGY — WSJ’s Deepa Seetharaman and Ezequiel Minaya report: “President Donald Trump has made Twitter Inc. more visible than ever. Now, the company has to find a way to cash in. “Twitter said Thursday it would revamp its advertising strategy, shifting away from older products like promoted tweets in favor of video ads, which executives said tend to attract big brands like car makers. The social-media service also plans to grow its data-licensing business, which charges companies that mine the billions of tweets flowing through the service every day.” Read more. TRUMP’S WALL: $21.6B — Reuters’ reports: “President Donald Trump's "wall" along the U.S.-Mexico border would be a series of fences and walls that would cost as much as $21.6 billion, and take more than three years to construct, based on a U.S. Department of Homeland Security internal report seen by Reuters on Thursday. “The report's estimated price-tag is much higher than a $12-billion figure cited by Trump in his campaign and estimates as high as $15 billion from Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.” Read more. PHYSICAL COMMODITIES RULE — POLITICO Pro’s Victoria Guida reports: “Three Senate Democrats today urged the Federal Reserve to toughen its proposed capital and disclosure requirements on banks that own and invest in physical commodities. “The rule, proposed in September, would particularly affect Goldman Sachs, which along with Morgan Stanley was grandfathered in to being able to extract, transport and store physical commodities, which other banks cannot do.” Read more. DEUTSCHE BANK CONFLICT OF INTEREST — ProPublica’s Jesse Eisinger reports: “If you measure President Donald Trump’s conflicts of interest by the amount of money at stake, or the variety of dicey interactions with government regulators, one dwarfs any other: his relationship with Deutsche Bank. “In recent weeks, Deutsche Bank has scrambled to reach agreements with American regulators over a host of alleged misdeeds. But because the president has not sold his company, the bank remains a central arena for potential conflicts between his family’s business interests and the actions of officials in his administration.” Read more. ** A message from American Bankers Association: When the Durbin Amendment was passed in 2010, retailers pledged that consumers would see the savings. Years later, the truth is out: big box stores have pocketed an extra $42 billion—and, according to a Federal Reserve study, just 1 percent of retailers are passing savings onto customers. Even worse, many consumers lost access to free checking and debit card rewards. Enough with broken promises and consumer harm. It’s time to end this lose-lose for consumers and repeal the Durbin Amendment. www.aba.com/RepealDurbin ** « View Archives Authors: Ben White bwhite@politico.com @morningmoneyben Mary Lee mlee@politico.com About The Author Ben White is POLITICO Pro's chief economic correspondent and author of the “Morning Money” column covering the nexus of finance and public policy.

The bag was found to contain men's underwear, two cell phones and an unloaded BB gun. Lyft requested a police report be filed. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland man, 39, was charged with the theft of lighters, cell phones and memory cards at Walmart Jan. 31. He concealed some items in his pants and removed other items from their packaging and concealed them in different locations in the store. He had previously been issued trespass warnings from other Walmart stores in the area. Property damage, Mayfield Road: A woman reported at 2:40 a.m. Feb. 1 someone slashed a tire on her vehicle while it was parked at Spoto's Bar & Grill. There were no suspects identified.

He said he was waiting for his mother, who was inside the store shopping.

  You are here: Home > Opinion > Editor's Pick Made in USA is hypocritical political correctness By Chen Weihua 0 Comment(s)Print E-mail China Daily, February 10, 2017 Adjust font size: US President Donald Trump won the 2016 election partly by cashing in on people's anger over excessive political correctness. Yet his words and deeds are cultivating a new political correctness in his country. It is about keeping manufacturing jobs in the United States and bringing them back from overseas, as he said in his inaugural address that his rules are "buy American and hire American." Walmart, the largest US company, has been running a TV ad about its commitment to purchasing $250 billion in the US and create 1 million jobs at home. It is nothing new for US businesses to promote themselves by tapping into the public's patriotism, but more of the mare under pressure now to do so after Trump threatened to punish those outsourcing their jobs abroad. Under such pressure, Carrier decided in late November to keep several hundreds of jobs in its Indiana plant instead of moving them to Mexico as previously planned. Last month, Ford Motors cancelled its $1.6 billion plant in Mexico and said it would instead invest $700 million in an existing plant in Michigan to make electric and autonomous cars. Trump also warned General Motors last month by tweeting "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" He has pressured Apple CEO Tim Cook to make iPhones in the US, instead of China, where the devices are assembled by a massive army of Chinese workers. Such a bid to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US may sound great to some voters. But it is against the free market principle, does not make any economic sense and won't help US consumers. The Walmart commercial features a factory scene where workers are hammering and welding, with sparks flying like fireworks. It does not look remotely like a factory with state-of-the-art facility or high automation, which should be the case for an advanced economy. Walmart's campaign has already been called into question when some products with "Made in America" labels are accused of not meeting the government criteria, as many parts are made abroad. In a globalized world, it is increasingly hard to find a product, especially a high-tech one, that is made totally by one country. Apple's iPhones are assembled in China but really designed in California. Its parts come from more than 700 suppliers from all over the world, and the assembly cost is less than $10, not big value. US consumers, however, will have to pay $30-40 more if they want an iPhone assembled in the US and $100 more if more of the components are made in the US. The Made-in-the-USA mania now seen in the US is not only against the basic economic law of comparative advantage, it is also going to hurt the most vulnerable US consumers and turn the US into a "Third World" economy. In fact, the factory scene depicted in the Walmart ad is probably hard to find now in China's developed coastal region. Those factories have long been relocated to the low-cost hinterland of West China or else to other countries which have lower labor costs. As a shrewd businessman, Trump should know all this well. The United Kingdom's Daily Mirror reported last week that Trump International Hotel, opened in Washington last October, contains rooms where almost everything in them was made outside the US. It is sad to see such hypocritical political correctness of Made in USA permeating the world's most advanced nation in the 21st century. The author is deputy editor of China Daily USA.

The suspect, Nathaniel Simmons, 49, of Brockton, is a registered Level 3 sex offender ruled too dangerous to go free in 2008 after being convicted of raping three women in the 1990s, according to a Taunton Daily Gazette story from May 2008. The judge who made the ruling in 2008 said: “He demeaned victims, three of whom had been his friends. He punched them, threatened them, wielded a knife, used a knife and pushed them. He admits to getting a thrill from his control over these victims.” Raynham police had initially charged Simmons with kidnapping, assault and battery, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, failure to stop for police and negligent driving Wednesday. But based on the evidence of rape and additional offenses obtained during the investigation, Raynham police amended the charges against Simmons, Donovan said Thursday afternoon. Simmons is now scheduled to be arraigned in Taunton District Court on Friday, Feb. 10 on charges of kidnapping, aggravated rape, four counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon (a car window twice, a cigarette lighter and a lit cigarette); three counts of assault and battery for allegedly biting, slapping and spitting on the victim; and several motor vehicle offenses including failure to stop for police. The victim was found partially clothed in the parking lot of Walmart on Route 138 in Raynham by strangers who came to her aid at approximately 3 p.m. Wednesday afternoon, Donovan said. The victim told police she did not know the suspect and he had abducted her earlier in the day in Brockton. In the Walmart parking lot the victim yelled for help and when witnesses intervened the suspect fled in a gray Ford Taurus, according to a statement issued by Raynham police Wednesday night. The victim was taken by ambulance to a hospital for medical care. She did not have any life-threatening injuries, Donovan said. Responding officers spotted the Ford Taurus on King Philip Street and attempted to stop it, Donovan said. Instead, the suspect refused to stop and sped up attempting to elude the officers, he said. As the Taurus approached the intersection of King Philip and South Main streets it rear-ended a green Jeep Cherokee waiting to take a left turn onto South Main. The Jeep in turn hit a gray Subaru Outback. The suspect was arrested at the crash scene at approximately 3:15 p.m. Wednesday. No one involved in the three-vehicle crash was transported to a hospital, according to fire personnel on scene. Police found several items of the victim’s clothing and a machete that the suspect had apparently thrown from the car while fleeing down King Philip Street, according to the police statement. After being released from prison after serving a sentence for a 1994 rape conviction, Simmons was charged with raping two other women at knife-point in 1998. He was still on probation when he committed those offenses. Simmons was eventually convicted of both subsequent rapes and was sentenced to serve eight to 10 years in prison. Prior to his scheduled release in 2007, then-Bristol County District Attorney Sam Sutter’s office filed a “sexually dangerous person petition” to keep him locked up. The petition is a civil action requesting a court order a convicted sex offender detained if the prosecution can prove beyond a reasonable doubt he is a high risk to re-offend. District Attorney’s office spokesperson Gregg Miliote said at the time the petitions are filed in a small percentage of sexual assault cases. Bristol County Superior Court Judge John P. Connor said in his May 22, 2008 decision ordering Simmons held: “The defendant has made an attempt to draft a prevention relapse plan, but has not had it reviewed and critiqued by his peers. The examiners conclude that the defendant has not progressed to the point of being able to control his deviant sexual urges.” Following the court's ruling, Simmons was to remain detained at the Massachusetts Treatment Center in Bridgewater for a period of one year to life. Each year, he would have had an opportunity to file a petition to the court claiming he was no longer a risk to re-offend. It was not known as of deadline Thursday when Simmons was released. He is listed with the state Sex Offender Registry Board as living at 347 Summer St., Brockton, and working at 225 John Hancock Road in the Myles Standish Industrial Park in Taunton.

The US giant could re-brand Wal-Mart products sold at bargain ­prices in the States as Asda for the UK market. PA:Press Association 5 Asda’s owner Walmart has hinted it will make its UK prices even lower than bud­g­et rivals That would hugely ramp up the competition that’s brought low prices in recent years. Wal-Mart, known for its competitiveness on price, admitted yesterday it has responded slowly to German budget chains in the UK. Chief administration boss Scott Price has now raised the stakes, saying it will use its bargaining power to “inv­est more aggressively in price”. 5 He said Asda would be able to sell at UK prices “that no one else can match”. The US giant has traditionally let Asda, which it bought in 1999, make its own way. But Sean Clarke, Asda’s chief exec since last July, used to work for Wal-Mart in Asia and knows it well.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

"It not only has changed our program, it's changed our university," coach Gary Gilmore said. "I've been here 21 years, and at no time have I seen groups of people so proud to wear our gear, put our sticker on their car. You go to Wal-Mart and there are 10 or 12 people walking around with our gear on where in the past it's been all Clemson and South Carolina stuff." All those new fans, along with the old ones, want to know what the Chanticleers will do for an encore. Coastal Carolina led the nation with 96 home runs last season, and players accounting for 79 of them are gone. Only three everyday players are back, but the weekend rotation returns, including CWS Most Outstanding Player Andrew Beckwith. So does star reliever Bobby Holmes. "The expectations are every bit equal to last year," Gilmore said. "The way we have to go about it may be a little bit different as far as how we put our team together and what the team's skill sets allow us to do. The goal is the same. It's to get back to Omaha. The one thing I did find out is that if you get there, anything can happen." Seth Lancaster, who missed the CWS after getting hurt in super regionals, moves from second base to third. He hit seven home runs, most of any returning player. "We're not going to hit 108 home runs," Gilmore said, "but I think we'll hit more than people give us credit for." The Chanticleers plan to be more aggressive on the bases. Billy Cooke is back after stealing a team-leading 27 bases. The Chanticleers finished with 112, and Gilmore said this team should be capable of 150. Beckwith (15-1, 1.85 ERA) led the nation in wins, threw two complete games in the CWS and was the winner in the title-clinching victory against Arizona. Alex Cunningham (10-4, 3.62) and Jason Bilous (3-1, 4.43) are the other weekend starters. Holmes (7-2, 4.20) is the bullpen ace. Newcomers Wood Myers at second base, Jordan Gore at shortstop and Cory Wood in left field will join the lineup. Myers played at a junior college last season after spending two years at North Carolina, Gore transferred from South Carolina and Wood was one of the top high school players in North Carolina last year. The Chanticleers will play their first season in the Sun Belt Conference after moving from the Big South. "We can't come out and play passive and say, 'Hey, we did this last year so it's going to be given to us,' " Beckwith said. "Everyone is going to (target) us. I think the Sun Belt is a little bit better competition, and our guys need to embrace it." Some things to know: NEW COACHES There are 30 new head coaches in Division I. Most notable are David Pierce at Texas, Greg Goff at Alabama, Steve Bieser at Missouri, Nick Mingione at Kentucky, Travis Jewett at Tulane, Lane Burroughs at Louisiana Tech, Greg Lovelady at UCF and Mark Wasikowski at Purdue. MARQUESS' FINALE Mark Marquess will retire after this season, his 41st at Stanford. He has 1,585 career wins, and his team is picked second behind Oregon State in the Pac-12. Marquess won national titles in 1987-88 and has led the Cardinal to the CWS 14 times, most recently in 2008. ACTIVE WINS LEADER Mike Martin, entering his 38th season at Florida State, takes over for Augie Garrido as the active career wins leader. Martin has 1,898. Garrido had an all-time record of 1,975 in 48 seasons. He coached the past 20 at Texas before being reassigned as special assistant to the athletic director last May. MORE OFFENSE The 2016 team average of 0.61 home runs per game was highest since 2010, team scoring of 5.57 runs a game was highest since 2011 and the team batting average of .275 was highest since 2012. The national fielding percentage of .967 was the best since at least 1970.

Matthew Argersinger and Andy Cross (TMFMattyA) Feb 10, 2017 at 2:02PM In this episode of Market Foolery, Mac Greer, Andy Cross, and Matt Argersinger talk about Coach (NYSE:COH), which beat earnings forecasts as it continues its long recovery; Mastercard (NYSE:MA), which also beat expectations and showed itself again to be a virtual money-printing machine; and Under Armour (NYSE:UA) (NYSE:UAA), which suffered during the holiday season much like the brick-and-mortar retailers that sell much of its athletic gear and apparel. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Jan. 31, 2017. Mac Greer: It's Tuesday, January 31st. Welcome to Market Foolery. I'm Mac Greer, and joining me in studio we've got Motley Fool Chief Investment Officer Andy Cross, also of Motley Fool Hidden Gem's fame, and we've got Matt Argersinger from Motley Fool Million Dollar Portfolio. Gentlemen, welcome. Matt Argersinger: Hey. Andy Cross: Hey, Mac. Argersinger: Glad to be here, Mac. Greer: Guys, let's get right to it. We've got lots of earnings news and I want to start with Under Armour. Matt, the stock just getting shellacked on Tuesday. Weaker than expected earnings and the company announcing that its CFO was leaving because of personal reasons. Argersinger: Shellacked is definitely the right word. Anytime you're, you've guided for revenue growth of 20% and it comes in at 12%, and then you guide for the following year of growth of 11% to 12% when you're also expecting 20%, or at least the market's expecting 20%, it's not gonna be a good day for your stock. And so when I look at Under Armour, what we have to remember, this is still very much a retail story. In other words, about 60% of Under Armour's revenue still comes from wholesale sales to department stores, to sports retailers, and it was a really bad holiday season for department stores and in-store retail sales. I looked at this report from Kiplinger that in-store sales for this past holiday were up just 1.4% year-over-year, which is a pretty anemic growth rate for retail sales. And so we also know that obviously traditional retail faces a lot of structural headwinds, and so anytime you have slower traffic to department stores, that's gonna force a lot of promotional discounting, retailers are trying to move a lot of inventory through, and what happened with Under Armour is there was a lot of discounting. Kevin Plank at least thinks that a lot of Under Armour's brand sort of got shuffled in with the other competitor brands, a lot of discounting, not a lot of sell-through, and therefore, you see the results that we see today. And especially, we gotta also remember that about 85% of Under Armour's sales still come from North America. They're growing great overseas, but North America was a really weak retail market and that's what we see with Under Armour's results. Greer: And we had some big retailers like Sports Authority go bankrupt over the last year. How much were they hurt by that, you think? Argersinger: I don't think . . . that hurt a little bit, but I remember that was probably in the single-digit percentage points. They've kind of moved past that, but still, it's a factor and I think Kevin Plank also mentioned in the conference call that they expect to get a lot of that volume back, that they necessarily didn't in the fourth quarter. Cross: You know I thought the pollsters had a bad forecasting year with Brexit and the U.S. election, but I gotta say, Matt and I were talking about this before the show. It just seems like Under Armour missed the forecasting mark pretty dramatically here. I think we've been thinking about this retail shift that's been going on and I just think that's just, when I think of Under Armour in this kind of quarter, especially around the holiday sales, and what they're looking out for 2017. They did miss the mark and I was just wondering if it's a consumer shift or if it's really just a forecasting miss on their part. Argersinger: Right, back in October, so this is October, this is right before getting into the holiday season and they were confident with their guidance, they thought they were gonna have a good holiday season, certainly guiding to 20% growth, and we were kinda also talking about the show, maybe this is why the CFO suddenly is leaving. Maybe there was some, just sort of missing the picture, like you said about what the retail environment really looks like. Greer: And taking a longer view, guys, Under Armour is a Motley Fool recommendation. They've delivered 26 straight quarters of 20% or higher sales growth up until this most recent quarter. And shares have been a really market crusher over the past five and ten years, right? Cross: From a growth investing perspective, the 20% sales, 20% revenue, those are beauty and usually, typically, the market underestimates those. So you think about investors, typically, Peter Lynch has written about this, underestimate those true growers as long-standing growth players. It's just that, when it sours and when it goes south, investors tend to flee the ship pretty quickly and dramatically. Greer: And we got a couple of questions on Twitter from some longtime listeners. Brendan asking whether this is a overreaction or a real concern and Sam asking whether this is a buying opportunity. Argersinger: Those are two great questions. I can't call it an overreaction, because this is a pretty dramatic slow-down. We talked about consistent 20% growth, now we're in the low double digits. Cross, you had an interesting number I think. The $2 billion in market value that Under Armour's losing this morning or today is equivalent to what, you said five years worth of operating profits? Cross: Yeah, maybe like $400 million in operating profits on $4 billion of sales, so yeah, you're looking at about five years of operating profits out the window in less than a day. Argersinger: But you also have to say, if you were an investor and you were looking for this company to grow at a 20% rate for the next several years, it's a totally different trajectory today going forward. And the question is, can they get back to that growth? They must, if they want to justify the valuation on the stock, which is still, which was high going in and it's still actually relatively high, even after losing 20% to 25% in the stock today. So I don't think it's an overreaction. I don't feel like this is an opportunity where you say I'm backing up the truck on this company. I think you have to be a little cautious. Maybe if you had a small position you were looking at, this might be a great time, but I wouldn't be the person who says I gotta go in 10% of my portfolio in Under Armour today on this miss. Cross: You know, also part of this, Matt, is I think is Kevin Plank was very honest about the assessment, but when you look at what happened with FitBit earlier this week, I mean the whole idea of consumerables and the amount of investments that Under Armour has made into the wearable market, they've spent $700 million in the past couple years I think, in kind of buying and going into the technology field. But concerns about the athletic market, what is the real growth potential behind that? Greer: Connected fitness, Andy. Cross: Connected fitness, but is it more of a trend? So I think investors are pairing these all together and thinking about the retail space, as well as the athletic space that Under Armour and Nike play into and wondering is the growth days, especially in North America, have they kind of slowed down? Greer: Well let's talk about that as we wrap up this conversation. Matt, Under Armour right now has a market cap of around $9 billion and falling. Nike has a market cap of around $90 billion, so we've got $9 billion and $90 billion. If I'm an investor in Under Armour or if I'm looking at this as a potential investment, should I be thinking of Under Armour as just an early stage Nike or is that really kind of an apples and oranges comparison? Argersinger: That's a great question. I like the comparison. In fact, my team in MDP, when we were looking at Under Armour, the past several months, we've compared it to Nike, looking at Nike as a public company over the last three decades, roughly. And it's interesting, if you look at Nike's history, Nike would have periods where its, year on and year end the growth is 25%, 30%. And all of a sudden, they'll have a year where growth slows down to 10% or even falls, revenue even falls. And you can go back and understand the explanation for it, but in reality, what you have is an interesting picture of a company that, over the last 20 years, has done exceptionally well for investors, Nike has. It's followed a very volatile trajectory, it's had years like this where all of a sudden 25% growth turned into 12% growth. And so if you're a long-term shareholder in Under Armour, I think you can take confidence in that and say you know what, maybe this is a company that's just going through some early growing pains, it can still be on that sort of $90 billion future market cap trajectory like Nike. Cross: And let's not forget Nike does most of their sales internationally, Under Armour does almost all, as Argersinger says, 85% of the sales domestically, so Under Armour has a lot of potential around the globe, which is that the margins there aren't quite as strong as they are in the US. Greer: Well let's switch to another retailer, Andy. Coach reporting better than expected earnings, shares up on the news. North American same-store sales for Coach rising 3%. Is this still all about handbags? Cross: Woo-hoo, 3%! It's like yay, great. But compared to where they were a few years ago, as Coach goes through their turnaround, the stock really has dramatically underperformed, sadly, over the last few years and this is an investment we have on stock advisor and watch carefully. I'm encouraged. I think we're seeing the turnaround come, Matt and Mac. 3% does not sound like a lot, and yes, Mac, it is mostly handbags, but Stuart Vevers, who's the new creative director, not new, he came in a couple years ago, and Victor Luis who's the CEO as of a few years ago, as longtime CEO Lew Frankfort stepped down, I really like what they're trying to do differently than what we're seeing in Under Armor. They're actually really pulling back on some of the discounting, they're trying to get that under control, they're trying to really rebrand and rebuild the brand of Coach. Stuart Vevers, from the creative side, really trying to bring back the sex appeal to what Coach may be, a little bit Mac, and we're starting to see it play out in the financials and so while 3% doesn't sound phenomenal compared to where they were, it's actually impressive. And importantly, it's the third consecutive quarter of comp growth, which is what you really want to see from Coach. Argersinger: I like that point because if you go back to Under Armour for a second, Kevin Plank on the conference call said we really, as Under Armour, we want to be perceived as a premium full-priced brand. We don't want to be lumped into all the discounted brands that are our competitors and compete on that level and I think that's what you want to see from Coach. I think for years, they probably found themselves falling into that, we've gotta discount these to move the inventory and things like that. And that does some long-term damage to the customer perception of the brand. And so if Coach can rekindle that, that's a good first step. Cross: There's a very interesting parallel, Matt, with Coach and Under Armour, not to draw too much to it, but Coach really invented the kind of handbag market that could serve at a higher price point than what you may find elsewhere, but not nearly as high as what some women were paying for like Louis Vuitton or for Prada, so they really kind of, especially in Japan, which is where they really had a lot of success early on, Lew Frankfort built this, and they ran that up and then they started seeing some of the pricing points. Michael Kors came in and started offering some very fierce competition, and then you started to see them get into the discounting game, and started to see their discount stores take on more of a share than their high-end stores. And I don't know if Under Armour is kind of in that spot right now, 'cause they basically created that performance . . . Greer: Athleisure wear. Cross: Well, performance gear, really. That was their heart and soul. Greer: Right. Cross: There are a little bit of parallels, it's taken Coach a long time to get back to where they were and it was some tough sledding for shareholders for many years. And now, from where Coach is, at a little bit of a baseline, and at 16 times earnings, I think your opportunity to make money in Coach over the next few years is much better than what it has been over the last couple years. Greer: What about the fashion market is so, so fickle? And you were talking about their rebranding, Andy. One thing that Coach has done recently is they have signed Selena Gomez, she's a pop singer, and they're really going after a younger market. Do you think Coach can pull that off? Cross: I think they can. I think they couldn't before. But with the fresh thinking that Stuart Vevers has brought in, the creative director, as I mentioned, and Victor Luis, I think that they are bringing a perspective, the new 1941 handbags they launched last year are starting to have some appeal, they're playing across higher price points that I mentioned, but also not foregoing the lower price points. There are rumors swirling around about Kate Spade on the market and whether Michael Kors or Coach will be bidding on Kate Spade. They also bought Stuart Weitzman shoes last year for $700 million, I believe. And that line was actually up 26% last quarter, so you're starting to see Coach really take some little bit more risks. They've moved away from what I think, if you looked at Coach four or five years ago, the kind of Coach bags they had there, I think just lost a little bit of their luster, a little bit of their appeal to the consumer and they're starting to get more into those traditional lines and a little bit more hip with Stuart and I like that. Greer: And I was doing some research on their website this morning. They have actually some nice men's wallets from $100 to $200 and I compare that to my binder clips, which I use for my wallet. And you can get a box of 100 heavy duty binder clips for around $4. Cross: Yeah. Are you in the market? Greer: I'm gonna stick with the binder clips for right now. Do you go wallet? Or what's your . . . Argersinger: I have a business card holder that has become my wallet. Greer: Nice. Argersinger: So I don't know if that qualifies as a wallet. Greer: Front pocket, back pocket? Argersinger: Back pocket. Greer: Really? And you're sitting on it? George Costanza style? Argersinger: No, I take it off, I take it off. Greer: That just seems uncomfortable. Argersinger: I never have much cash anymore. Cross: Dude, my brother pulled out his wallet the other night and it was like George Costanza. I was like what do you got in there? He started pulling out his glasses, put 'em on ... Greer: Cross, what are you doin'? Argersinger: Starbucks receipt from five years ago. Cross: I was not, but my wife bought me a wallet that has my initials on it so I feel like I'm obligated to use it, it's one of those thin ones. And I rotate between the front and the back, I gotta say in the front, it's not quite as . . . it looks a little, not as attractive. Greer: Give the binder clip a shot. That's all I'm saying. It's better than the money clip. Money clips get stretched. You can buy these in bulk. 100 for four bucks. Argersinger: Four bucks. Four cents a binder clip probably lasts for years. Greer: But something tells me I'm not Coach's target market. You think that's fair? Cross: Yeah, I think that's fair. I think that's fair, but I think as we'll find out in the next segment, I don't know if we'll be carrying money clips either in the next few years. Greer: Well that is a good segway to our final story. Mastercard reporting better than expected earnings. Share is dipping a little on Tuesday. Matt, this stock, when you look at the one-year chart, the five-year chart, the 10-year chart . . . Argersinger: Doesn't matter. Greer: It just crushes the market, it's like they're just throwing all sorts of money at investors. And it's up around 20% over the past year. Argersinger: Right. We've actually had Mastercard on our watch list in MDP for I think almost since the beginning, or for a couple years since my team took over MDP. We should have bought it, it was stupid for us not to because we're always waiting for a good price or what we think is a good price in Mastercard, but there really is never a bad time to buy it. It just produces dramatic cash flows, consistent growth, and it's a story, as Cross alluded to, the story away from cash. The trend away from cash, to cashless transactions, to credit card use, especially outside of the United States. It's just unrelenting. And you've got Mastercard, Visa, American Express, of course the big brands. Visa's bigger than Mastercard, but Mastercard's growing a little faster. I think the results were as solid as usual, I think the stock's down a little bit because the strong U.S. dollar, which we've seen over the last few months, is hurting them a little bit 'cause they're seeing more of their growth outside of the U.S. and so when you see the euro and the pound just getting smashed the last three months or so, that's gonna hurt the results a little bit. But otherwise, this is a machine, I really don't know why you wouldn't buy at any price. Cross: I mean it's a business that's growing at least two times faster than global GDP, two or three times on the top line and their so little reinvestment needs. They generate $5 billion in operating, $4 or $5 billion in operating cash flow every year, and they spend $300 to $400 million on capital expenditures and software and the rest, they just buy back stocks. They bought back three and a half billion last year and they bought back $1.1 billion last quarter. So it's just one of those compounding machines that continues to hum along into a market that is shifting and I think dramatically, I think we've seen a little bit of the S curve come and we're gonna start seeing more and more adoption. Four out of five transactions around the globe are still in cash, so as the adoption grows, the more electronic commerce. And Mastercard takes a little nibble of all those transactions. Last year, Mac, they did almost $5 trillion of gross dollar transactions across their platforms. That's about a third the size of the U.S. GDP. Greer: That's a lot. That sounds like a lot. Cross: And they just take a little nibble of that, and that network, Visa's network, they're extremely stable and they're hard to break into. Now you do find some regulatory concerns around the globe when you have that amount of market share and that locked in cost and whether the pricing is a little too high and even 1% or 2% of the transactions, they start sometimes facing some concerns about regulatory concerns, but really, Mac, it's a machine and the stock is not expensive and you're going to find consistent growth and investors like that like us. Greer: And how often do you guys use cash these days, 'cause I very rarely use cash. I can carry the same $20 for like a week or two. Argersinger: I was thinking before the show, when we were talking about it, I think the only time I pay cash is when I go to my barber. I have a barber in my neighborhood that I go to and it's because he takes credit cards, but he prefers cash, so I just give him cash, but that's literally the only time I ever go to the ATM. Cross: Me too. I went to 7-Eleven instead of Starbucks this morning and I paid for my coffee with cash. It was just such an odd experience. I pulled out the cash from my wallet and I gave it, and the guy dug through his cash register and gave me change and I was like, I don't know. It was just like . . . Greer: And then what do you do with the change? Cross: Right, exactly. I look for something to like donate it, into like, they donate to animals or whatever it might be, some kid's fund, and they didn't have it, so I just stuck it in my pocket, I'm like what am I gonna do with this? My daughter will find it and probably swallow it. Argersinger: That's the point about Mastercard sort of growing overseas and the point that four out of five transactions globally are still in cash. I spent the fall in Berlin, where you always use cash. You're expected to use cash and they look at you funny if you're at a restaurant and you say I want to pay with credit card, you have to tell them, because they have to go get a special machine, and bring it over to the table. It's a crazy phenomenon, but it's amazing how accustomed we are, in the U.S., to not using cash. Yet in Europe, of all places, where you think it's just as advanced as we are, nope. They're still using cash, probably 90% of the time. Cross: Yeah, I mean mobile payments, as we've talked about many times before, is a growth market. There are a lot of players in there. Mastercard and Visa, tied to it certainly, but obviously Apple Pay and PayPal all players in there. It is just going to be a growth market. Very interesting to see how BitCoin plays all into this and the Blockchain technology when it comes to transactions. But I think Mastercard and Visa too, both recommendations of ours, will continue to do well in that space for many years to come. Greer: Okay, well we will end it there. Matt and Andy, thanks for joining us. Cross: Thanks Mac. Argersinger: Thanks Greer. Great job.

Chris Hill, Taylor Muckerman, and Jason Moser (TMFWizard) Feb 10, 2017 at 11:46AM In this episode of Market Foolery, Chris Hill welcomes Taylor Muckerman and Jason Moser to the show as they dig into the latest news from Fitbit (NYSE:FIT), which just made a steep cut to its sales forecast and announced a round of layofs. They also provide an update on Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD), which saw its buyout bid from Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) drop significantly now that it is clear that regulators will insist on bigger divestitures before they allow the merger to happen. Finally, the team answers a listener question regarding heavy equipment manufacturer Cummins (NYSE:CMI). A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on January 30, 2017. Chris Hill: It is Monday, January 30th. Welcome to Market Foolery. I am Chris Hill. Joining me in studio today from Million Dollar Portfolio, Jason Moser. And from Stock Advisor Canada, Taylor Muckerman. Good to see you gents. Jason Moser: What's up dude? Taylor Muckerman: Good to see you. Hill: We got a little bit of snow today. Muckerman: We did Hill: How about that, you wake up, you look outside and there's snow on the trees Muckerman: The perfect amount, the roads are perfectly fine and it looks pretty Moser: I takes the forecast of it to go ahead and just throw the public school system into complete chaos. Just the forecast of it Hill: Yeah. Moser: I mean school started two hours late today, but it was like . . . Hill: Where do you live? Not for me, I got to wake my son up, he was like "Is school . . .?" I was like, "No buddy, schools on, chop, chop, let's get moving." Muckerman: There you go. A little pat on the rear and out to the bus. Hill: Exactly. We're going to dip into the full mail bag. We are going to start, though, with a pair of stocks that are heading south very quickly. Fitbit does not report their fourth quarter until late February and today the company confirmed, what some had feared and at least one person in this studio had predicted, which is that this report is going to be ugly. Fitbit lowered their sales guidance and they are laying off 6% of the work force. Let me just . . . stick with me on the numbers here, because when companies offer guidance, they are offering a range. Which makes perfect sense, they are not going to be able to predict it down to the dollar. The sales guidance range that Fitbit had offered was, "Well, we think sales are going to come in somewhere between $725 and $750 million." They came out today and said, "Actually, it is going to be around $580 million," which is a massive drop and the stock, not surprisingly, down about . . . at one point it was down 16% to 17%. It has come back up a little bit, but it is still down 11% to 12% percent. Moser: Yeah, I would warn investors who are thinking that maybe this is the opportunity to pick up shares on the cheap to give that notion a lot of thought. You need to be able to identify the catalyst that will turn this thing around, because I don't think there is one personally. I am not trying to be glass half-empty Jason here. It is just the way it is. We have talked about Fitbit a lot since it went public. It's really been a bad investment. I don't like saying that. I like what they stand for, right. I mean they are really trying to do a good thing, I think, in making people more aware of their health and encouraging fitness and what not. At the end of the day, it is a gadget company, it's a one-trick pony, for the most part. Its one trick, it turns out, to kind of suck. It is not very good at what it does. Muckerman: It has got a class action lawsuit, or did for the heart rate monitoring and then it couldn't measure your steps properly. Moser: I mean any time you have a situation where you feel like, "Okay, I am wearing this thing for this one reason" and now, it's being brought into question as to whether it actually does it well or is it even doing it correctly. It is hard to gain that trust back, I think, ever. Most consumers who maybe on the fence in thinking maybe, maybe not. There are plenty of reasons to go ahead and think maybe not now. Like you said, this was a major, major guidance cut. The midpoint of guidance from then to now, that is about a 20% change. This is a company that is going to be very dependent on growing that top line in order to improve its business. This is essentially . . . what is going on right now is like GoPro 2.0, in you're seeing this company has hit its peak and now, I think, what we are going to see here now going forward is a lot of ratcheting back of guidance. They're obviously going to be cutting cost, unfortunately letting some people go, you're going to see margins starting to compress, you are going see cash start to burn, and you're going to start to see these guys try to figure out what do we do here to sort of right the ship. I am not saying that's an easy answer, because I don't know what they do. It is a great example of where you have a company where the co-founders who are leaders there,forward thinking cultures. Those are all great qualities, but they are just that, they are qualities. I think it is important to note that those are things that we like to find in investments, but they don't mean that they will actually be good investments. Muckerman: This comes at a time when people are spending money. Consumer confidence is as high as it is in January, in the last 12 years. Across any month, a lot of that has to do with the election. People thinking their taxes might get cut and what not. Consumer confidence is up, holiday sales were strong, but this isn't a sticky product. Gartner Research said that in the U.S., U.K., and Australia, 30% of the folks that have a smartwatch or a fitness tracker have stopped using it within a year. So, if you are not getting people to reup on the newest product in your cycle, and people obviously don't see the benefit of continuing to use it, it is just a dying breed and they are trying to say that maybe they can help save lives by teaming up with healthcare companies. I think they teamed up with Medtronic to allow their Fitbit app to input its data into Medtronic platform to combine the analysis of diabetic's glucose levels with their activity levels to try to monitor that. So maybe there is a future there. It is going to take some proving to do that and this is still a small test with Medtronic and less and less people are using their product in the first place. Moser: I think it best to just adjust the market opportunity. Muckerman: Yeah. Moser: I think initially when this company went public, the perception at least was the market opportunity was as big as the number of people on the face of this planet. Everybody could wear one and that is just turning out to just not be the case. Hill: You mentioned, Jason, you thought this was GoPro 2.0. I was thinking this morning, when I was reading though the coverage of this. This is reminding me actually of Flip Cam. Remember Flip Cam? Which was revolutionary until the iPhone came along and Android phones mirroring what the iPhone was doing and then all of a sudden, everybody who has a mobile phone has a camera in it. Then it ends up getting acquired by Cisco Systems and then Cisco Systems quickly writes down that entire thing. I have said this before, I think the likely outcome for Fitbit is an acquisition of some sort and to your point, Taylor, about them partnering up with Medtronic. They ought to be . . . if they are not talking to Medtronic about . . . because Medtronic is a big company . . . Muckerman: Yes it is, yeah. Hill: . . . that is very well-established in terms of medical devices. That is one of the things I was trying to think about. Okay, if you think someone's going to buy Fitbit, and I think someone is, I don't know what the price is going to be, but I think someone will buy them. Then the question becomes, "Well, who's the likely candidate?" Any time we talk about potential acquisitions, our mind tend to go toward . . . tend to go broader than what makes sense and they also tend to go to "Well, who has got the money?" So in the tech . . . Moser: Well at this point, I even think I even have the money. Hill: But you hear that all of the time. It's like, "Well, you know Apple could buy them." Well yeah, you know, look what Apple has. Moser: They have a phone, they don't need it. Hill: They are not going to buy them. But Medtronic actually makes sense to me, as opposed to . . . Jason, one of the companies I was thinking about was . . . well, who's spent money on health fitness app recently? Under Armor. Well, yeah, I don't think Under Armor is going to buy this company. Muckerman: No, because they will just embed this in their clothes and not have you wear something on your wrist. Maybe an insurance company out there lowering your premiums based on . . . like Progressive has the thing that you plug into your car, so if you drive more safely, your insurance premium goes down. Maybe if you are more active, your insurance premium with this Fitbit. I could see people strapping it to their dog collar and "Get out there and be somebody pup." Moser: Look at an example of a business where you probably thought acquisition at some point or another. LeapFrog, right? We talked about LeapFrog a lot on the way down and how it was kind of neat what they had, but you could tell more and more that their window for their market opportunity kept on getting smaller and smaller because kids were just making their initial devices like Kindles and iPads and iPods and what not. I look at Fitbit and I think who wants to actually take on that headache. I have always been somewhat critical of Apple on the Apple Watch side because I felt like they built a device that tries to do to much as opposed to something where, given their resources, the technology, the brand power, I think Apple could actually develop a Fitbit style, truly dedicated fitness device that could completely wipe Fitbit out. Without even thinking twice, because of everything I just said there, the finances, the resources, the brand power, what not. I don't even know that I would look Fitbit ultimately as an acquisition at this point because you got to figure, who really needs it, right? I don't know that anybody actually needs it, because what they're doing isn't necessarily so special. Muckerman: You could develop it for cheaper than you can buy it. Moser: Sure. Hill: Let's move on to Rite Aid. If there is a stock that's making Fitbit feel better itself today, it is Rite Aid. Shares are hitting their lowest point since 2014 after Walgreens lowered the buyout price by nearly $2 billion. And just to refresh everyone's memory, October of last year they agreed to a buyout at $9 a share, today that gets lowered to $6.50, maybe as much as $7.00 a share, which is a pretty big haircut. Muckerman: Yeah it is. It is really dependent on the amount of stores that they would have to divest in order to make this deal happen. If they have to divest 1,000 or less, they will probably get $7, if they have to divest up to 1,200, which is what many people are thinking, likely $6.50 per share. But when you are looking at it, you see Fred's, I think was a Tennessee-based pharmaceutical store that said they would originally buy the stores when the deal was thought to be approved. But now the FTC is coming out and saying that there is still some question marks here. Maybe having to divest more than the original 867 stores, so seeing that haircut immediately . . . and shares weren't even trading up to the $9 level to begin with. Hill: Right. Muckerman: Some uncertainty right from the very get go. Hill: Just to be clear, what is driving this is that Walgreens is looking, "How do we get this deal done?" If there is a silver lining for the shareholders of Rite Aid, it's that Walgreens is committed to getting this deal done. It is going to be at a lower price. Muckerman: They extended the deadline. I think the deadline was this past Friday. They extended it out to July 31st. There has been a private equity firm, Cerberus, that has come out and said that they would like to potentially buy these stores if Fred's can't make it happen. There is some action on that side of things to help get the deal done, but you are still looking at what price Walgreens is going to pay and what price Rite Aid shareholders are willing to accept. Hill: Isn't Cerberus the mythical three-headed dog who guards the gates of hell? Muckerman: That is their logo, I think, as well. Hill: If you're a business, and a company called Cerberus is calling you up and wants to do a deal. You're in trouble. Muckerman: Scratching your head. Hill: Either run the other way or you're in trouble. Muckerman: They have the money though. Moser: What's going on right now shows you that Rite Aid is in a position of total weakness. They are at the mercy of a suitor and it needs the suitor more than the suitor needs them. We are seeing a lot of consolidation in this sector. Walgreens buying Rite Aid, CVS buying Target's pharmaceutical division. You go back and you read the 8-K that the press release that came out when this deal was initially announced, I think back in late 2015, it was really interesting to see more or less the termination fees here involved. It basically all falls on Rite Aid's shoulders. I think Walgreens knew going into this, that there were going to be some antitrust concerns at least or some questions. So that initial price was one where they set that mark and said "Okay, we may have to divest some here and if that is the case, we will be able to make all of this stuff happen." In most cases, the onus really fell on Rite Aid's shoulders to make sure this deal happened. If it doesn't happen, most scenarios result in Rite Aid actually having to pay Walgreen a termination fee regardless. So when you think about it from that perspective. Muckerman: Wow, that's kind of backwards. Moser: Walgreens is a much bigger company. It has close to three times as many stores, a much bigger market gap, more financial resources. At the end of the day, this is a deal that is going to happen. They are going to divest what they need to divest. If you are a Rite Aid shareholder, there is light at the end of the tunnel from that perspective. It goes to show you, Rite Aid has been in a position of weakness for some time. Hill: Our email address is marketfoolery@fool.com. You can also hit us up on Twitter @marketfoolery is our Twitter handle. From Todd Whitcomb in Utah, "I am attempting to value Cummins Incorporated and I was curious to get your expert opinion. Thanks. Love the Show." Taylor, Cummins for those unfamiliar, this is a heavy equipment maker. Engines, power generation, turbo technologies, big stuff. Muckerman: Yeah, we're talking 15 liter, 12 liter engines. A company that has had a good run. We talked right before the show. It is up about 60% over the last year. That makes me wonder if the valuation might be a little to rich. If you look at some of the metrics that it is trading at, like a price to earnings, just north 21 times. The five year average has been right around 15. The price to book, not as bad, right around 3.5 times. Price to book historically over the last five years around 3.2. You are looking at a lot of these areas where this company does business: mining . . . its mining business is down about 45% from its all-time high. Its marine business is down about 40%. Oil and gas is still down 80%. There is some upside there, but they're not expecting the bottom to flatten until at least the middle of 2017, maybe even later into the year. You might be able to get a better price, especially because we have seen this run up, when results really haven't caught up to that share price performance. Hill: I was going to say, that's surprising to hear you tic off the various percentages of how their business units have fallen. I can see a six . . . I mean this is a $25 billion company. I could see a 60% run up like that if they were flat out crushing it. Muckerman: They're not. Hill: They're not. Muckerman: In the U.S., revenues are still falling. They are looking at China to be a stronger segment, because obviously heavy machinery companies, you're not going to succeed on a global basis unless China is helping you out. So they do have a favorable outlook for China, more near-term than North America. The balance sheet is there, they have some time to wait it out, maybe some M&A on the technology side. If not, you could certainly see some share buybacks or an increase in the dividend as a likely possibility. There is some upside there, in term of where it is at now, I don't have a price target or anything like that. It does appear a little richly valued based on the last five years worth of multiples. Hill: So this is one of those companies we get questions about from time to time and the name pops up, in part because it is one of those spaces that I think certainly over the last few years when you think of Caterpillar and sort of the ups and downs that Caterpillar has gone through. This type of industry becomes more interesting to watch. It is not the sexiest industry in the world. Muckerman: Right. Hill: But it becomes more interesting. Muckerman: One thing that you will look at with these cyclical industries that rely on oil and gas and commodities. If the price to earnings, or the pork value is a little high, maybe it is because earnings have been depressed, so it might be toward the bottom of the cycle. You always want to look a little deeper than just these multiples. If you look at enterprise value to revenue, the spread between its five year average and where it is at right now isn't necessarily as high those other two that I mentioned. You really want to dive in a little bit closer, because earnings could be depressed based on cyclicality. Hill: So I looked up the origins of this company. Started by a man named Clessie Lyle Cummins. Clessie, there is a name that I've never heard in my life before. Muckerman: Bring it back. Hill: Grew up in rural Indiana. Never had formal education past the eighth grade. Is just one of those people that just makes you shake your head in wonder at what he is able to do once he starts working and innovating. He was awarded 33 patents for his various inventions. Set five world records for endurance and speed for trucks, buses and race cars. Really amazing. I love stories like that. There are the people that are highly educated and do amazing things, and there are people who have the brains, don't get the formal education and do them anyway. Muckerman: Roll their sleeves up and get it done. Moser: Yeah, and you hear about that stuff and you think about financial implications there and how much money ends up making and yada, yada, yada. It is natural to think about, wow, it would be so great to make all of that kind of money. Those are the people that just do it, because they love it. That is just what they love doing. For them, the money is like one of those things that just comes from building really great products and ideas. Muckerman: Really fast cars apparently. Hill: Yeah. Muckerman: Or trucks and buses. Hill: Thanks for being here guys. Moser: Thank you.

Calgary-based law firm Higgerty Law says it filed the suit at Court of Queen’s Bench in Edmonton on Feb. 3. Alberta Health Services charged Walmart last month with 174 violations of the province’s Public Health Act; none of the accusations has been proven in court. Higgerty Law says it is seeking damages for anyone who was not refunded for food that had to be thrown out _ whether or not it was contaminated _ as well as anyone who got sick. The claim also seeks special and punitive damages and health-care costs. Last May’s wildfire forced more than 80,000 to flee the northern Alberta city and residents were not allowed to return for a month.

(Cameron Smith) Print Email Cameron Smith By Cameron Smith AL.com Email the author | Follow on Twitter on February 10, 2017 at 8:40 AM comments I don't like to think about it, but Sappho is getting old. It didn't seem that long ago that my wife and I bought her out of the back of a pickup truck in the Walmart parking lot in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. A farmer's black lab had gotten together with a golden retriever, and he wanted to get rid of the little fur balls that resulted. That's about as Alabama of a start as any dog could have.  She shredded and chewed her way into our hearts. It's funny how dogs do that. We trained her with little pieces of hotdog. All she has ever wanted to do is retrieve things. We simply oriented all her training around that. It's one of those cases where nature didn't really care if it was nurtured or not. Yeah, I know. Sappho is one of the goofiest dog names ever. But I'm a classics major who's too creative for my own good. She's a great dog. That's saying something. Some dogs are just dogs. Others are even good dogs. But great dogs--it's like they leave a paw print on your soul. My first dog was like that too. Mary Poppins was a formidable giant schnauzer, but she was the most gentle of giants to my siblings and me. She would literally stand between people she didn't know and us. It was her not so subtle way of protecting her pups. There are a handful of times I remember my father actually crying. The day we had to put Poppins down was one of them. Sappho's stature might be a little less intimidating than Poppins, but she loves my boys just as much. For some dogs, the arrival of children means they take a back seat. Sappho didn't mind; the boys were just new people to play with. For eight years, they've poked, prodded, and squeezed on her. She hasn't so much as growled at them. The older two boys play with her in the yard, sneak her food at the table, and look at her the same way I looked at Poppins all those years ago. My youngest has taken a particular liking to her. He'll cuddle up next to her on the sofa and frequently fall asleep using her for a pillow. When she least expects it, he'll run up to her and give her a bear hug in the kitchen. She knows he's part of our pack.  To say she's just a dog doesn't give her the credit she's earned. She's been a companion on our adventures, a teacher focusing on the simple things, and a comfort on some awfully bad days. Dixie, Emmitt, and Fire are just a few of the canines that come to mind who truly impacted people I care about. Those great dogs might be gone, but they made their people a little better--a little more patient, a little more forgiving, a little less likely to leave food out on the counter. Sappho's coat has thinned to the point where she needs a sweater to keep warm, her teeth are worn from years of chewing, and she has gas so bad that it can clear a whole house. But it doesn't matter. She's earned that comfortable spot on the couch as a member of our family. Old dogs like Sappho don't need to learn new tricks to warm our hearts, but they do need to know that we appreciate them in the hustle in bustle of life. I'll be sure to do that when my bright-eyed friend greets me at the door tonight.

Staff Reports / Published: February 10, 2017 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     Woman charged for sexual assault Pottsville police reported that about 3:30 p.m. Feb. 3, Brittany Marks, 24, of Frackville, was arraigned and re-committed to Schuylkill County Prison where she is being held in lieu of $20,000 straight cash bail on a separate charge. The latest charges, filed by Pottsville police detectives, include statutory sexual assault, indecent assault and corruption of minors. Police said they received information indicating that a juvenile boy fathered a child with Marks while he was 15 years old at the time and the infant was born in June of 2016. During the course of the investigation, police said, they learned from Schuylkill County Children and Youth Services that the juvenile was interviewed and admitted having sex with Marks, police said. Marks was also interviewed and also admitted to both knowing the boy’s age at the time and also with having a sexual encounter with him in September 2015, police said. Police also said a DNA test was completed confirming the boy as the father of the child. Pottsville man jailed for assault A 19-year-old Pottsville man was jailed after Pottsville police responded to a report of a domestic disturbance about 11 p.m. Monday at 800 W.

Police said Troy Richard Everitt was charged with misdemeanor simple assault and summary harassment. He was arraigned Wednesday by Magisterial District Judge David A. Plachko, Port Carbon, who ordered Everitt committed to Schuylkill County Prison after he was unable to post 10 percent of $25,000 bail. Police said officers were called to the China Inn restaurant for a report of an assault and, along with Palo Alto Police Chief Joseph Kavanaugh, spoke to a woman who said Everitt, her live-in boyfriend, choked her and “smacked” her in the face. The woman also said that Everitt was wanted by several police departments, including state police, for domestic violence. A subsequent check of Everitt determined he did have outstanding warrants, police said, adding that the female victim showed signs of injury to her neck and left cheek. Police said Everitt was taken into custody and committed to Schuylkill County Prison on the outstanding warrants. Man charged for making threats PORT CARBON — A 30-year-old Pottsville man was arrested by Port Carbon police in connection with an incident at 68 Lang St., Apt. 1, on Jan. 31. Police said David J.

Police said officers were called to 68 Lang St. about 3:50 p.m. for a report of a disturbance and spoke to a woman who reported Travares, her ex-boyfriend, smashed windows on her home and was smashing her car. The woman also said that Travares left her several threatening text messages saying he was going to kill her one way or another and that he was going to damage both her home and vehicle, police said. In one message, police said, the woman reported Travares was going to burn her house down and said he hoped her children were inside at the time. Police investigate stabbing incident FRACKVILLE — A Maryland man was jailed after being arrested about 6:30 a.m. Wednesday by state police at Frackville in connection with an assault in Frackville. Police said Jasper Dillon, 38, of Brandywine, Md., was arraigned by Magisterial District Judge Christina E. Hale, Frackville, on charges of aggravated assault and other offenses.

Short term: Prices are stalling. Intermediate term: Prices are trending. By the way, prices are vulnerable to a correction towards 69.03. The projected upper bound is: 70.93. The projected lower bound is: 67.14. The projected closing price is: 69.04. Candlesticks A big white candle occurred. This is generally considered bullish, as prices closed significantly higher than they opened. If the candle appears when prices are “low,” it may be the first sign of a bottom. If it occurs when prices are rebounding off of a support area (e.g., a moving average, trendline, or retracement level), the long white candle adds credibility to the support. Similarly, if the candle appears during a breakout above a resistance area, the long white candle adds credibility to the breakout. During the past 10 bars, there have been 7 white candles and 3 black candles for a net of 4 white candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 26 white candles and 24 black candles for a net of 2 white candles. Three white candles occurred in the last three days. Although these candles were not big enough to create three white soldiers, the steady upward pattern is bullish. Momentum Indicators Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators. Stochastic Oscillator One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 94.0956. This is an overbought reading. However, a signal is not generated until the Oscillator crosses below 80 The last signal was a buy 8 period(s) ago. Relative Strength Index (RSI) The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 59.48. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 81 period(s) ago. Commodity Channel Index (CCI) The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is 273.This is an overbought reading. However, a signal isn’t generated until the indicator crosses below 100. The last signal was a buy 7 period(s) ago. MACD The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a buy 5 period(s) ago.

JULIE OLIVER / POSTMEDIA Article Tweet Change text size for the story Print this story Report an error Related Stories Trustee says board showed lack of communication over vanished school funds For nearly 2 1/2 years, members of the parent council at Leslie Park Public School say, they have felt as though they needed to keep a secret. At least $14,839.41 vanished from the school's fundraising account, according to a council investigation. The parents at the school haven’t been told of the full extent of the loss. The parent council accuses the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board of repeatedly preventing them from detailing to parents what happened at the small school of 115 students in a residential area near Greenbank and Baseline roads. The board says it couldn't reveal the details about the missing funds since the matter was under police investigation. Since no charges were laid, the investigation was "not a matter of public record" and there were limitations on what it could reveal, the board said, although it has since agreed to reimburse the school council for the entire amount. How thousands of dollars went missing, who took it, and why parents were kept in the dark has been revealed through documents obtained by Postmedia and through interviews with members of the school’s parent council. In September 2014, Dave Wright went to the bank to determine how much money was in the Leslie Park Public School parent council’s bank account, which was used to keep the proceeds of fundraisers such as pizza days, cake walks and movie nights. Wright, the school’s newly elected parent council treasurer, was checking to see how much money was left in the account from the year before. It was one of his first acts as treasurer — a role he’d taken over from Corinne Reynolds who had left the school at the end of the previous academic year. The numbers didn’t make sense to Wright. He said he felt butterflies in his stomach. The account — which had a balance of $10,616.81 in January 2011, the last time a financial report had been prepared by the council — was overdrawn by $121.94. More than $6,500 from school council fundraisers since that time also wasn't accounted for. The money had vanished. "I thought 'I'm just going to report this and the police are going to come in, the cop cars are going to pull up on the lawn, and this is what is going to happen,'" Wright told Postmedia. “I went immediately to the principal and I went into his office and closed the door and said 'It's bad.'" After Wright told the principal, the principal contacted the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board. The board's advice was for the council to make an official complaint to police, which they did. What followed was a multi-year investigation and the painstaking tracking of the spending in the account by the council. It was a challenge made more difficult because there were no financial reports prepared by the council for three years between 2011 and 2014, a direct violation of OCDSB policies, according to Wright. "All we had was the numbers, trying to figure out where each nickel and dime was going," Wright said. Bank records obtained by the council showed unusual withdrawals beginning in July 2012. The first odd withdrawal was a $150 cheque Reynolds — who acted as both the school's former treasurer and council chair — had written to herself.  The cheque was supposedly for Walmart gift cards. Later there was a $100 cheque issued to her now former husband. Then $200.59 was supposedly spent on a camera. There was another $300 cheque supposedly for Walmart gift cards, a $705 cheque for the rights to show movies at school that were never actually purchased and $900 for the supposed purchase of a table. Some of the cheques were made out to herself using both her married and maiden names, a review of the bank records revealed. In November 2012, a second camera was supposedly purchased, this time for $300. "I've never seen them," Wright said. The bank account required two signatures on every cheque, but the person who previously co-signed the cheques had left the school when her children graduated. When Wright went to the bank, that woman's name was still on the account. It appears no one from the bank ever checked to see if there were two signatures — that was the responsibility of the account holder, the council was told. While some of the transactions in the account matched purchases made by council, the majority of the transactions did not, Wright said. In total, there were 319 transactions in the school council account between January 2011 and September 2014, including 196 cheques. There were 113 cheques that only had a single signature; 13 of them bounced because of insufficient funds, according to the council investigation. Wright said the handling of the school council's finances seemed to violate several school board policies regarding school councils and fundraising. It was even more concerning as it continued after a massive fraud was uncovered at the Rockcliffe Park Public School council in February 2012. But unlike the school in Rockcliffe, where large sums of money were owed to creditors, Leslie Park owed only a few hundred dollars to a pizza supplier, making the loss of money easier to suppress from parents and the public, Wright said. In a written statement to Postmedia, the school board's executive officer, Michele Giroux, said the school council opted to maintain a bank account at a separate financial institution than the school, and neither the principal nor the school district had any access to or oversight of the account. However, board policy that came into effect in September 2013 requires financial reporting at school council meetings. That wasn’t being done at Leslie Park, according to Wright. The board said policy has since changed so that a school council must provide signing authority to the treasurer and two other officers. Other policies surrounding financial management were changed in 2013 and 2014, Giroux said, although it wasn't clear how the mismanagement at Leslie Park was able to continue until September 2014. The financial investigation report undertaken by the parent council took two years to compile and during that time, the work being done by the council was mostly kept secret. At first, council members thought they had to let police conduct their investigation. But as the weeks dragged into months and then years, they became more concerned about the silence. Parents at the school still hadn’t been told about the missing money. The council says the school board stymied them whenever they asked to go public. By February 2016, the board provided council with $2,000 to "offset any loss that may have otherwise been determined had there been sufficient information to quantify that a financial loss was actually incurred." The council responded in a letter to the board that they felt transparency to the school parent community was essential. The council also said they had begun preparing a media release on their own and asked for the board's assistance. "Full disclosure of what happened will bring closure to this ongoing saga and as well assist in an effort to recoup our actual losses," the letter said. Instead the school authorized a much more sanitized version for the parents in the school's spring newsletter. Under the title "School Council Transparency", the newsletter advised parents only of "discrepancies" in the school council account balance and transactions "that could not be fully accounted for." There was no mention of a specific amount, although it did make an admission that the school hadn't been in compliance with OCDSB policy. It was around this time, in April 2016, that the school council learned from the board that police had met with Reynolds. In an email obtained by Postmedia and sent to the school board superintendent of instruction, Frank Wiley, Ottawa police Const. Michael Dosdall wrote that Reynolds "quickly admitted to wrongdoing" and "wanted to make things right." Dosdall wrote that Reynolds couldn't remember "what all happened" but seemed confident that she could pay back as much as $5,000 in restitution. Dosdall warned that once any money is paid back it is a civil agreement, and police wouldn't be able to charge anyone criminally. However, proceeding that way would ensure the school recovered some of the money. Attempts to reach Dosdall by Postmedia were unsuccessful. When Postmedia approached Reynolds earlier this week, she said she had agreed to pay back $5,000 and that she had written a letter of apology. She disputed that the amount missing was as high as council claimed, however. She has not been criminally charged, and the board said the police investigation is finished. The board wouldn't say whether they had recovered any of the missing funds. The amount allegedly recovered from Reynolds is disappointing to council, whose members thought they had an agreement with the board that the amount that would be paid back would be twice that much. One email in June 2016 from Wiley to council members indicated that the board had proposed a $3,500 settlement. In an August 2016 letter to the school board, the council members said that agreement for anything less than $10,000 was unacceptable. The letter also again demanded that the school community be provided the details of what happened. "Since the OCDSB and our council have always agreed that we need to promote financial responsibility in our schools, we simply do not understand why you would not want to hold someone fully responsible in this case," they wrote. When still nothing happened by November 2016, Wright publicly presented a report on the full scope of council's investigation into the missing funds. That meeting was well attended by council members, but only a handful of other parents. Of the 17 parents present, only six weren't already on parent council, according to a draft copy of the meeting minutes. Post media contacted Wright and the council after receiving a copy of that report in late January. It was also during that meeting that the council presented a letter they wanted to send to the parents. That letter outlined the details of what had happened as well as a link to the financial report. To date, the council has not received approval from the board to send the letter to parents or to post it on the school's website or Facebook page. The council alleges that the school's principal also recommended changes to the meeting's minutes, which must be publicly posted on the school's website. The first draft version of the minutes indicated that Wright had presented a report on the missing money, including the approximate amount. According to council members, those references were removed by the principal, along with a notation about how council wanted to advise the parents about what had happened in subsequent copies. "I do not have any detailed knowledge of this issue, but can say generally that the school council is the approval authority for their minutes and the minutes should reflect the decisions made at the meeting," Giroux said in her statement to Postmedia. At the January school council meeting, council co-chair Karen Adelberg was pulled aside shortly before the meeting and was told by the board that the school would get all its money back. She made the announcement during the meeting. However, Adelberg said the council wasn't told if it is money that was repaid by the person who took it, or if it’s money being paid out of the school board's budget. "This whole thing wasn't about trying to squeeze the board for money," said Wright. "We wanted the person responsible to take accountability for it." Leslie Park Public School is one of eight Ottawa schools the school board recommended for closure in a report last year. aseymour@postmedia.com Twitter.com/andrew_seymour   How $15,000 vanished from an Ottawa school council's bank account — and stayed secret By Andrew Seymour First posted: Thursday, February 09, 2017 11:29 PM EST | Updated: Thursday, February 09, 2017 11:35 PM EST For nearly 2 1/2 years, members of the parent council at Leslie Park Public School say, they have felt as though they needed to keep a secret.

At least $14,839.41 vanished from the school’s fundraising account, according to a council investigation. The parents at the school haven’t been told of the full extent of the loss. The parent council accuses the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board of repeatedly preventing them from detailing to parents what happened at the small school of 115 students in a residential area near Greenbank and Baseline roads.  The board says it couldn’t reveal the details about the missing funds since the matter was under police investigation. Since no charges were laid, the investigation was “not a matter of public record” and there were limitations on what it could reveal, the board said, although it has since agreed to reimburse the school council for the entire amount. How thousands of dollars went missing, who took it, and why parents were kept in the dark has been revealed through documents obtained by the Citizen and through interviews with members of the school’s parent council. In September 2014, Dave Wright went to the bank to determine how much money was in the Leslie Park Public School parent council’s bank account, which was used to keep the proceeds of fundraisers such as pizza days, cake walks and movie nights. Wright, the school’s newly elected parent council treasurer, was checking to see how much money was left in the account from the year before. It was one of his first acts as treasurer — a role he’d taken over from Corinne Reynolds who had left the school at the end of the previous academic year.  The numbers didn’t make sense to Wright. He said he felt butterflies in his stomach. The account — which had a balance of $10,616.81 in January 2011, the last time a financial report had been prepared by the council  — was  overdrawn by $121.94. More than $6,500 from school council fundraisers since that time also wasn’t accounted for. The money had vanished.  “I thought ‘I’m just going to report this and the police are going to come in, the cop cars are going to pull up on the lawn, and this is what is going to happen,'” Wright told the Citizen. “I went immediately to the principal and I went into his office and closed the door and said ‘It’s bad.'” After Wright told the principal, the principal contacted the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board. The board’s advice was for the council to make an official complaint to police, which they did. What followed was a multi-year investigation and the painstaking tracking of the spending in the account by the council. It was a challenge made more difficult because there were no financial reports prepared by the council for three years between 2011 and 2014, a direct violation of OCDSB policies, according to Wright. “All we had was the numbers, trying to figure out where each nickel and dime was going,” Wright said. Bank records obtained by the council showed unusual withdrawals beginning in July 2012.  The first odd withdrawal was a $150 cheque Reynolds — who acted as both the school’s former treasurer and council chair — had written to herself. Leslie Park Public School’s former treasurer and council chair Corinne Reynolds - The cheque was supposedly for Walmart gift cards. Later there was a $100 cheque issued to her now former husband. Then $200.59 was supposedly spent on a camera. There was another $300 cheque supposedly for Walmart gift cards, a $705 cheque for the rights to show movies at school that were never actually purchased and $900 for the supposed purchase of a table. Some of the cheques were made out to herself using both her married and maiden names, a review of the bank records revealed. In November 2012, a second camera was supposedly purchased, this time for $300. “I’ve never seen them,” Wright said.  The bank account required two signatures on every cheque, but the person who previously co-signed the cheques had left the school when her children graduated. When Wright went to the bank, that woman’s name was still on the account. It appears no one from the bank ever checked to see if there were two signatures — that was the responsibility of the account holder, the council was told. While some of the transactions in the account matched purchases made by council, the majority of the transactions did not, Wright said. In total, there were 319 transactions in the school council account between January 2011 and September 2014, including 196 cheques. There were 113 cheques that only had a single signature; 13 of them bounced because of insufficient funds, according to the council investigation. Wright said the handling of the school council’s finances seemed to violate several school board policies regarding school councils and fundraising. It was even more concerning as it continued after a massive fraud was uncovered at the Rockcliffe Park Public School council in February 2012. But unlike the school in Rockcliffe, where large sums of money were owed to creditors, Leslie Park owed only a few hundred dollars to a pizza supplier, making the loss of money easier to suppress from parents and the public, Wright said. In a written statement to the Citizen, the school board’s executive officer, Michele Giroux, said the school council opted to maintain a bank account at a separate financial institution than the school, and neither the principal nor the school district had any access to or oversight of the account. However, board policy that came into effect in September 2013 requires financial reporting at school council meetings. That wasn’t being done at Leslie Park, according to Wright. The board said policy has since changed so that a school council must provide signing authority to the treasurer and two other officers. Other policies surrounding financial management were changed in 2013 and 2014, Giroux said, although it wasn’t clear how the mismanagement at Leslie Park was able to continue until September 2014. The financial investigation report undertaken by the parent council took two years to compile and during that time, the work being done by the council was mostly kept secret.  At first, council members thought they had to let police conduct their investigation. But as the weeks dragged into months and then years, they became more concerned about the silence. Parents at the school still hadn’t been told about the missing money. The council says the school board stymied them whenever they asked to go public.  By February 2016, the board provided council with $2,000 to “offset any loss that may have otherwise been determined had there been sufficient information to quantify that a financial loss was actually incurred.”  The council responded in a letter to the board that they felt transparency to the school parent community was essential. The council also said they had begun preparing a media release on their own and asked for the board’s assistance. “Full disclosure of what happened will bring closure to this ongoing saga and as well assist in an effort to recoup our actual losses,” the letter said. Instead the school authorized a much more sanitized version for the parents in the school’s spring newsletter. Under the title “School Council Transparency”, the newsletter advised parents only of “discrepancies” in the school council account balance and transactions “that could not be fully accounted for.” There was no mention of a specific amount, although it did make an admission that the school hadn’t been in compliance with OCDSB policy. It was around this time, in April 2016, that the school council learned from the board that police had met with Reynolds. In an email obtained by the Citizen and sent to the school board superintendent of instruction, Frank Wiley, Ottawa police Const. Michael Dosdall wrote that Reynolds “quickly admitted to wrongdoing” and “wanted to make things right.” Dosdall wrote that Reynolds couldn’t remember “what all happened” but seemed confident that she could pay back as much as $5,000 in restitution. Dosdall warned that once any money is paid back it is a civil agreement, and police wouldn’t be able to charge anyone criminally. However, proceeding that way would ensure the school recovered some of the money. Attempts to reach Dosdall by the Citizen were unsuccessful. When the Citizen approached Reynolds earlier this week, she said she had agreed to pay back $5,000 and that she had written a letter of apology. She disputed that the amount missing was as high as council claimed, however. She has not been criminally charged, and the board said the police investigation is finished. The board wouldn’t say whether they had recovered any of the missing funds. The amount allegedly recovered from Reynolds is disappointing to council, whose members thought they had an agreement with the board that the amount that would be paid back would be twice that much. One email in June 2016 from Wiley to council members indicated that the board had proposed a $3,500 settlement. In an August 2016 letter to the school board, the council members said that agreement for anything less than $10,000 was unacceptable. The letter also again demanded that the school community be provided the details of what happened. “Since the OCDSB and our council have always agreed that we need to promote financial responsibility in our schools, we simply do not understand why you would not want to hold someone fully responsible in this case,” they wrote. When still nothing happened by November 2016, Wright publicly presented a report on the full scope of council’s investigation into the missing funds. That meeting was well attended by council members, but only a handful of other parents. Of the 17 parents present, only six weren’t already on parent council, according to a draft copy of the meeting minutes. The Citizen contacted Wright and the council after receiving a copy of that report in late January. It was also during that meeting that the council presented a letter they wanted to send to the parents. That letter outlined the details of what had happened as well as a link to the financial report. To date, the council has not received approval from the board to send the letter to parents or to post it on the school’s website or Facebook page. The council alleges that the school’s principal also recommended changes to the meeting’s minutes, which must be publicly posted on the school’s website. The first draft version of the minutes indicated that Wright had presented a report on the missing money, including the approximate amount. According to council members, those references were removed by the principal, along with a notation about how council wanted to advise the parents about what had happened in subsequent copies.   “I do not have any detailed knowledge of this issue, but can say generally that the school council is the approval authority for their minutes and the minutes should reflect the decisions made at the meeting,” Giroux said in her statement to the Citizen.  At the January school council meeting, council co-chair Karen Adelberg was pulled aside shortly before the meeting and was told by the board that the school would get all its money back. She made the announcement during the meeting. However, Adelberg said the council wasn’t told if it is money that was repaid by the person who took it, or if it’s money being paid out of the school board’s budget. “This whole thing wasn’t about trying to squeeze the board for money,” said Wright. “We wanted the person responsible to take accountability for it.” Leslie Park Public School is one of eight Ottawa schools the school board recommended for closure in a report last year. aseymour@postmedia.com Twitter.com/andrew_seymour Smart soles and other high-tech ways to stop falls New global vaccine initiative is looking to Canada for support Video Connect With Us Email Alerts Get the latest news in your mailbox as it happens Weather Weather Currently Feels Like We want you to have the most accurate weather report you can.

The world's largest beverage maker's shares fell 3.1 per cent to US$40.73 (RM181.06) in morning trading on yesterday. Coca-Cola has been offloading much of its low-margin bottling business to cope with falling demand for carbonated beverages in North America. It has also been stepping up efforts to reduce sugar in its beverages, amid growing pressure from health experts and governments who have blamed sugary drinks for a rise in obesity. Coca-Cola, like rival PepsiCo Inc, has also been building its non-carbonated drinks portfolio. Global volumes of its non-carbonated drinks, which include tea, juices and energy drinks, rose two per cent in the fourth quarter, while soda volumes fell two per cent. Costs related to the refranchising of Coca-Cola's US bottling operations look to be a more meaningful drag on the company's full-year profit than analysts were expecting, brokerage Cowen & Co said in a note to clients. The company forecast 2017 adjusted earnings to fall 1-4 per cent from US$1.91 per share in 2016. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of US$1.97, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to the company's shareholders more than halved to US$550 million, or 13 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from US$1.24 billion, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier. The quarter included a US$919 million charge related to the refranchising of its bottling operations. Excluding items, the company earned 37 cents per share, in line with estimates. Net operating revenue fell about six per cent to US$9.41 billion, the seventh straight drop, but beat estimates of $9.13 billion, helped by higher sales of its sodas in North America, its biggest market. Volume sales rose one per cent in North America, including a one per cent growth in sales of its carbonated sodas such as Sprite and Fanta. However, global volume sales for the company fell one per cent in the fourth quarter, hurt by high levels of inflation in certain Latin American countries. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Bursa Malaysia to trade higher next week Amazon warns that trade protectionism could hurt business China regulator still plans oil futures, weighs easing equity curbs Ringgit likely to trade easier vis-à-vis greenback next week Dollar rises on hopes for Trump tax reform If Trump hits China, regional demand would ease blow in Asia Bursa Malaysia opens easier Sri Lanka eyes China free trade deal this year, PM to visit in May Another day, another mall: How KL Gateway Mall hopes to succeed in a crowded market Ringgit opens slightly lower against US dollar Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Coca-Cola may pull products from Vermont to comply with GMO law Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The driver, described as male in his late 40s to mid-50s, then followed the victim in the Jeep. Once the man got to his van, the driver drove toward the victim and accelerated, according to police. WATCH: Know these 2? Verizon robbers at large The Jeep struck the victim's shopping cart, pushing it into the victim, police said.

The suspect convinced her to buy gift cards from Walmart and Target and provide him with the redemption codes in an effort to pay her grandson's bond. It was reported the woman lost over $11,000 as a result of the scam. General assistance, Jefferson Drive: A woman said Feb. 1 her husband, a military veteran, was walking his dog when he observed a U.S. flag being flown upside down. He did not know if it was a sign of protest or if it was unknowingly being flown in that manner. She only wanted to make police aware of the situation. General assistance, Millridge Road: Officers were asked to speak to an eight-year-old child at Millridge Elementary School Feb. 1 about stealing school property. The principal said he was taking small items, such as erasers. Property damage, Strathaven Drive: A resident reported Feb. 1 her mailbox had been damaged. It was determined a city plow was responsible for the damage and the city would replace the mailbox. Disturbance, Golfview Lane: The nursing staff of an assisted living facility said Feb. 1 the daughter of a former resident was threatening them. Officers learned she had been talking on her cell phone about the poor quality of the staff, while she was removing items from her mother's former room. As no threats were actually made, officers simply waited on the property until the East Cleveland woman, 50, left the facility.

Attempted burglary, Cranbrook Drive: A resident reported at 4:45 p.m. Feb. 4 a man, who appeared to be drunk or on drugs, was trying to get into her house. When she asked what he wanted, he told her "I am here for you." Responding officers subsequently located the Bedford man, 24, on Brainard Road, near Fitworks. It was determined he was schizophrenic. He was taken to the hospital and placed in lock-down. Charges are pending against him in county court. Theft, Alpha Drive: A boy, 14, told police Feb. 4 his iPhone was stolen from an unlocked locker at Skyzone. It was later found in possession of another child, who returned it. Disturbance, Wilson Mills Road: Officers responded to Denny's around 6 a.m. Feb. 5 for a report of a man, 41, who was refusing to leave after he was found sleeping in a booth. They learned he was homeless and had an active warrant with University Heights police. Officers from that city were unable to pick him up so he was given a ride to a bus stop. Receiving stolen property, Wilson Mills Road: Officers located a stolen vehicle occupied by four men at the gas pumps at True North Shell Feb. 5. The driver, a 20-year-old Euclid man, was subsequently arrested for receiving stolen property. A 22-year-old passenger, of Euclid, was arrested on a warrant and turned over to Euclid police. The other two men were released at the scene and the vehicle was recovered for Cleveland police.

The Friday news briefing: An at-a-glance survey of some top stories National by The Canadian Press Posted Feb 10, 2017 2:50 pm MST Last Updated Feb 10, 2017 at 4:00 pm MST Highlights from the news file for Friday, Feb. 10. ——— TRUDEAU SETS STAGE FOR MEETING WITH TRUMP: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says areas where he disagrees with U.S. President Donald Trump will be addressed in a respectful way when the two men meet Monday. Trudeau has been walking a communications tightrope in recent days, refusing to speak directly to the president’s executive order banning immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries. Trudeau, who was in Yellowknife Friday, says there are many areas where he sees eye-to-eye with Trump, including jobs for the middle class and economic growth. ——— TRUDEAU DEFENDS HANDLING OF ELECTORAL REFORM: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he abandoned a promise to overhaul Canada’s electoral system because he was afraid the result would be political discord and instability. He told a town hall in Yellowknife that he knows people are disappointed but suggests he’s prepared to accept the political consequences, whatever they may be. He explained that the idea of a ranked ballot was abandoned because too many people believed it would be a system that would favour the governing Liberals. ——— QUEBEC STUDENT BLOCKED FROM ENTERING U.S.: A Quebec student athlete is mystified as to why he was barred from entering the U.S. this week. Yassine Aber underwent a five-hour interrogation in which he was asked about religion and his Moroccan roots. The track and field athlete with the Universite de Sherbrooke said he was travelling to a weekend competition in Boston on Thursday when he ran into trouble at the Stanstead crossing on the Quebec-Vermont border. Aber was told he did not have a valid passport or visa to enter the country. Aber, who was born and raised in Sherbrooke, Que., says his Canadian passport is valid and does not expire until 2026. ——— TRUMP SAYS HE’LL PREVAIL ON TRAVEL BAN: U.S. President Donald Trump says his administration will do whatever is necessary to keep the country safe. And he says he has “no doubt” that he will win the court fight over his travel ban. His comments at a news conference came hours after Trump tweeted that Wednesday’s appeals court decision on the ban was “disgraceful.” The court ruled against reinstating the refugee and immigration order. Speaking at a White House news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump says the administration will continue to work the case through the court process ——— PAYPAL FREEZES MEDIA ORGANIZATION’S ACCOUNT: A community newspaper’s payment to enter a feel-good story about a family of Syrian refugees in an awards competition prompted PayPal to freeze the account of a national media organization as a suspicious transaction. The weekly Flin Flon Reminder entered the article as part of its submissions to the annual Canadian Community Newspaper Awards. Flin Flon publisher, Valerie Durnin, said when she tried to pay the $242.95 for the paper’s entries, PayPal flagged the payment as possibly not in compliance with its “acceptable use policy.” In an email, PayPal promised to follow up within 72 hours of its investigation, which it never did. Instead it reversed the payment. ——— CLASS ACTION SUIT FILED AGAINST WALMART CANADA: A Calgary-based law firm has launched a class-action suit against Walmart Canada, alleging the retailer sold potentially contaminated food after the Fort McMurray wildfire. The lawsuit seeks damages for anyone who was not refunded for food that had to be thrown out — whether or not it was contaminated — as well as anyone who got sick. The Alberta government has charged Walmart with 174 violations of the province’s Public Health Act. Some of the charges include failing to dispose of food items, including candy, potato chips, beans and condiments. Walmart did not comment on the allegations, which have not been proven in court. ——— JOBLESS RATE FALLS MARGINALLY: Canada’s jobless rate dropped marginally in January to 6.8 per cent from 6.9 per cent. Statistics Canada says there was an increase in part-time jobs and a lesser gain in full time work. Economists described the overall job growth as “very impressive” and “remarkably strong.” ——— CANADA’S EAST AND WEST COASTS GET BLAST OF WINTER: Snow storms caused havoc in both the Atlantic provinces and British Columbia’s south coast Friday. Drivers in parts of the Maritimes faced snow squalls and blinding whiteouts as a fast-moving winter storm blew into Atlantic Canada. Parts of southwestern New Brunswick ended up with more than 30 centimetres of snow. The storm in British Columbia tied traffic in knots between the south coast and the interior. ——— POLICE TO SKIP CANADA’S LARGEST PRIDE PARADE: Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders says his force won’t participate in the city’s annual pride parade. Saunders pointed to divisions within the LGBTQ community as the primary reason for his decision, but emphasized it “will have no impact” on the force’s outreach efforts. The presence of police in the parade emerged as a contentious issue when the parade was interrupted last summer by a protest from the local chapter of Black Lives Matter. ——— BC PREMIER APOLOGIZES FOR HACKING CLAIM: British Columbia Premier Christy Clark has apologized to New Democrat Leader John Horgan over her accusations that the Opposition was involved in criminal hacking of her Liberal party’s website. Clark said she made a mistake and jumped to conclusions. The apology came as an Independent member of the legislature came forward to say her staff had access to the private information — without any attempt at hacking. Vicki Huntington says her staff uncovered the private information on the B.C. Liberals website while looking for 2016 donations to the party. ——— Next Story Movie Trailers February 10, 2017 to February 16, 2017 Landmark 6, 10015 Manning Ave. PH:791-6610 Landmark Cinemas Landmark Cinemas Fort McMurray Rings (14A) 3:15pm / 6:30pm / 9:35pm The Space Between Us (PG) 2:55pm / 6:00pm / 9:15pm Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (14A) 3D 9:45pm 3:25 / 6:40pm A Dog’s Purpose (PG) 3:35pm / 6:50pm / 9:55pm La La Land (PG) 9:25pm Split (14A) 3:45pm / 7:00pm / 10:05pm XXX: Return of Xander Cage 3D 9:35pm 3:50pm / 6:45pm Monster Trucks (PG) 3D 12:20pm     660 NEWS CALGARY NATIONAL TSX, Dow hit record highs to end the week Feb 10, 2017, 5:41 PM Alberta Premier Notley heading to Washington at month’s end to talk trade Feb 10, 2017, 5:21 PM Whirling disease found in trout in world-class Bow River fishery Feb 10, 2017, 5:15 PM PC member files formal complaint; says Jason Kenney seeking to undermine party Feb 10, 2017, 5:14 PM Officers punched and bitten during coffee shop arrest Feb 10, 2017, 5:02 PM Ex-SNC Lavalin execs acquitted of bribery charges after wiretap evidence nixed Feb 10, 2017, 4:44 PM Couch potatoes: 'Intoxicated' New Brunswick men go through drive-thru on a sofa Feb 10, 2017, 1:30 PM Balloon man needs another month to raise $20K following lawn chair flight Feb 10, 2017, 1:12 PM Lawsuit filed in connection to explosion in Fort McMurray fire aftermath Feb 10, 2017, 1:04 PM Ontario cabinet ministers urged to trumpet trade with US in Trump era Feb 10, 2017, 12:36 PM Halifax abuzz after sighting of wayward sheep: 'He got a little spooked' Feb 10, 2017, 12:35 PM Sugary drink consumption predicted to harm Canadians' health, cost economy: study Feb 10, 2017, 12:25 PM BUSINESS SPORTSNET OIL & GAS ENTERTAINMENT Fed board member Tarullo announces resignation Feb 10, 2017, 12:26 PM Settlement in 38 Studios case ends lawsuit over failed deal Feb 10, 2017, 11:39 AM Ontario urges Ottawa to set up loan guarantees for softwood producers Feb 10, 2017, 11:06 AM Lawsuit filed over allegations Fort McMurray Walmart sold bad food after fire Feb 10, 2017, 10:22 AM Canada adds 48,300 new jobs, but wage growth and hours worked slip Feb 10, 2017, 6:52 AM West Coast Bias: When will the urgency to win take over in Winnipeg?

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States Retail Dominates Friday’s Analyst Upgrades and Downgrades By Jon C. Ogg February 10, 2017 12:50 pm EST Print Email Tweet With stocks at record highs, investors have to be considering how they should be positioned. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was last seen over 20,200 and the S&P 500 was up at 2,310. These are huge milestones for the stock market. With the bull market now almost eight years old, the reality is that the major stock indexes have risen more than 200% from their inflection point lows of March 2009. One prevailing trend that just will not go away is that investors have managed to find new reasons to buy every single sell-off. Those same investors are also looking for new and overlooked opportunities. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst reports each day of the week to find new investing and trading ideas for its readers. Some analyst reports cover stocks to buy, while other reports cover stocks to sell or avoid. What stood out for Friday, February 10, 2017, was that the analyst calls were dominated by the retail sector. Perhaps this is due to the proposed border adjustment tax looking dead on arrival, or perhaps there has been an inflection point where companies are finding their footing on how to deal with the online competition of brick and mortar. Starbucks Corp. (NASDAQ: SBUX) may be more in coffee and food than it is in retail, but this giant was downgraded to Hold from Buy at Argus. Most downgrades from other analysts covering Starbucks were on valuation, but this call from Argus was based on a weaker sales outlook. Starbucks closed up 1% at $55.81 on Thursday, but after being indicated down 0.5% at $55.50 on Friday morning, it was up 0.3% at $55.97 in midday trading. Starbucks has a 52-week range of $50.84 to $61.64 and a consensus analyst price target of $64.56. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) was started with a Positive rating and assigned an $80 price target by Susquehanna in a much broader retail segment call. Wal-Mart has a 52-week range of $62.35 to $75.19 and a consensus price target of $74.04. Sears Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ: SHLD) may not look like it was the subject of a very cautious call because its shares soared on Friday. Sears shares were up over 40% at $7.95 in early trading indications, but the stock’s mid-Friday gain was up 30% at $7.25, after previously closing at $5.54. That huge gain was based more on a restructuring and cost/debt cut rather than based on actual earnings excitement. Sears was started as Negative with a $4 price target at Susquehanna, which is the equivalent of a Sell rating elsewhere. J.C. Penney Co. Inc. (NYSE: JCP) was started with a Positive rating and assigned a $8.50 price target at Susquehanna. The shares closed up 1.3% at $7.07 on Thursday, but after being indicated up another 1.5% at $71.7 on Friday morning, this was down by 0.6% at $7.03 in mid-Friday’s trading session. J.C. Penney has a 52-week range of $6.35 to $11.99. Friday’s full list of top analyst calls included other companies, like Ford, Intel, NVIDIA, Teva Pharmaceutical, Twitter, Alamos Gold, Fossil and others. More key analyst calls in the retail segment were seen as follows: Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NYSE: BBBY) was maintained as Buy at Argus, but the firm lowered its price target to $50 from $55 (versus a $40.33 prior closing price). Big Lots Inc. (NYSE: BIG) was started as Neutral with a $55 price target (versus a $52.97 prior close) at Susquehanna. Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: COST) was started with a Positive rating and assigned a $192 price target. Costco shares were up 0.5% at $171.80 midday on Friday, in a 52-week range of $138.57 to $171.87 and with a consensus price target of $175.46. Dillard’s Inc. (NYSE: DDS) was started as Positive and given a $60 price target (versus a $57.29 close) at Susquehanna. Dillard’s was up 0.3% at $57.47 mid-Friday, versus a 52-week range of $53.61 to $88.58. Kohl’s Corp. (NYSE: KSS) was started as Neutral with a $41 price target (versus a $42.10 close) at Susquehanna. Macy’s Inc. (NYSE: M) was started as Neutral with a $31 price target (versus a $32.37 close) at Susquehanna. Macy’s was down 2.1% at $31.67 midday on Friday, perhaps with this unenthusiastic rating not driving much hope for a merger. Nordstrom Inc. (NYSE: JWN) was started as Neutral with a $47 price target (versus a $45.55 close) at Susquehanna. Its shares were last seen down 2.8% at $44.36 in mid-Friday trading. The 52-week range is $35.01 to $62.82. Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT) was started with a Neutral rating at Susquehanna. Its $70 price target compares with a previous close of $66.41, and Target shares were down 1.5% at $65.41 on Friday. The 52-week range is $62.94 to $84.14, and the consensus target price is $84.14. TJX Companies Inc. (NYSE: TJX) was up 0.1% at $76.22 midday, after Susquehanna started it as Positive with a $92 price target. Elsewhere in analyst research, Merrill Lynch has four Buy-rated stocks yielding 8% or more. There are also five safe strong dividends for investors if that elusive market sell-off ever comes to pass.

Customers Pam King and her son Rhys, 2, shop for organic groceries at Whole Foods Market Arroyo Parkway store in Pasadena, Calif. in this Nov. 7, 2007 file photo. While Whole Foods led the organic food craze in the U.S., mainstream grocery chains have jumped on board as more and more people began buying organic. Damian Dovarganes Associated Press i By Caitlin Dewey The Washington Post Organic food has never been so popular among American consumers. Ironically, that's bad news for the brand that made organic a household name - namely, the Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods. On Wednesday, Whole Foods reported what is arguably its worst performance in a decade, announcing its sixth consecutive quarter of falling same-store sales and cutting its outlook for the year. The company is closing nine stores, the most it has ever closed at one time. A mere 16 months ago, Whole Foods predicted it would grow its 470 U.S. locations to more than 1,200. The problem is one that chief executive John Mackey probably didn't predict when he first opened Whole Foods as a neighborhood natural foods store 36 years ago: Organics, then a fringe interest, have become so thoroughly mainstream that organic chains now have to face conventional big-box competitors. Mass-market retailers were responsible for 53.3 percent of organic food sales in 2015, according to the Organic Trade Association; natural retailers clocked in just north of 37. And Whole Foods is hardly the only store feeling the squeeze: Sprouts and Fresh Market, the second- and third-largest publicly traded organic stores, have also seen falling stock prices. "Whole Foods created this space and had it to all to themselves for years," said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones. "But in the past five years, a lot of people started piling in. And now there's a lot of competition." facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:09 Oroville Dam spillway: 'It's not supposed to do that' Pause 1:43 Water continues to rush down Oroville spillway on Friday 0:35 See dramatic aerial views of damaged Oroville Dam spillway 1:02 Union Pacific train derails into water south of Elk Grove 3:19 Sacramento Kings head coach Dave Joeger during pregame conference 1:14 UC Davis law student helps free people detained in San Francisco's airport after Trump refugee executive order 0:44 Dramatic video captures break at Oroville Dam spillway as concrete chunks sent flying 0:09 Mudslide closes all lanes of Interstate 80 in Sierra 1:08 Damaged Oroville Dam spillway undergoes more water releases 2:14 Ramping up water releases at Oroville Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Do we live in one of America’s unhealthiest states?

(Natalie Fertig / McClatchy) In many ways, the story of Whole Food's decline is also the story of how the organic movement took over America. Between 2005 and 2015, sales of organic food increased 209 percent, according to the Organic Trade Association. Last year, organic sales topped $43.3 billion. The driving force behind this growth, most analysts agree, is none other than Millennials: Consumers aged 18 to 34 are the largest buyers of organics, and they're the most likely to consider themselves "knowledgeable" about their food. As they came of age, mainstream grocery chains have been forced to adapt, too. Walmart ramped up its organics selection in 2006. Kroger introduced its Simple Truth brand in 2012 {mdash} the store's CEO Mike Ellis later said it was the store's "most successful brand launch ever." Earlier this week, Aldi announced plans for a $1.6-billion U.S. expansion, with much of that growth aimed at offering "a wider range of organic and gluten-free products." facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:09 Oroville Dam spillway: 'It's not supposed to do that' Pause 1:43 Water continues to rush down Oroville spillway on Friday 0:35 See dramatic aerial views of damaged Oroville Dam spillway 1:02 Union Pacific train derails into water south of Elk Grove 3:19 Sacramento Kings head coach Dave Joeger during pregame conference 1:14 UC Davis law student helps free people detained in San Francisco's airport after Trump refugee executive order 0:44 Dramatic video captures break at Oroville Dam spillway as concrete chunks sent flying 0:09 Mudslide closes all lanes of Interstate 80 in Sierra 1:08 Damaged Oroville Dam spillway undergoes more water releases 2:14 Ramping up water releases at Oroville Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email How to spot GMOs on your grocery store shelf Scott Faber of the Environmental Working Group, an organization pushing for GMO labels on food packaging, shares some tips for finding items on grocery store shelves that contain genetically modified organisms (GMO). As Vice President of Government Affair By volume, the largest organic retailer in the U.S. is currently believed to be Costco - which in 2015 sold $4 billion of organic produce and packaged foods. Like Walmart, Kroger and Aldi, Costco sells organic produce for considerably cheaper than do natural food stores, farmer's markets or Whole Foods. In fact, lowering prices has been one of Whole Food's primary strategies for dealing with competitors. Apart from shuttering stores and stalling expansion plans, the company is continuing to focus on "365 by Whole Foods," a two-year-old division aimed at launching stores for "value-conscious" consumers. It's also been dropping prices at its regular locations and mailing out national discount circulars, something it had not previously done. Speaking to investors on Wednesday, Mackey indicated that he did not want to see "too big of a gap" between the prices at Whole Foods and those at stores like Costco and Kroger. But some organic advocates are concerned that lowering the prices of organic foods - an apparent prerequisite for mainstream popularity - can only happen at the expense of the movement's early principles. This fear is not entirely new: Michael Pollan fretted about it in the pages of The New York Times when Walmart began selling organic Rice Krispie treats 11 years ago. But with results like Whole Foods, it is becoming more urgent, said Ronnie Cummins, the co-founder of the Organic Consumers Association. Cummins points out that some of the most successful, most mainstream organic products don't meet his organization's strict definition of what organic should be. Those include the ubiquitous Earthbound Farms, which grows its lettuces in monocultures, and Aurora Organic Dairy, which has been criticized for running its operation like an industrial factory farm. "If you're a publicly traded corporation, you have no choice but to maximize short-term profits," Cummins said. "But we are going to be complaining to Whole Foods if they decrease their quality to keep up with the competition." That approach may be most profitable now, he acknowledges - but Whole Foods needs to think long-term. After all, when the company was founded, there was barely even a market for organic foods.

That's the warning the head of the association for new home builders has been issuing every chance he gets in recent months. Even with a "making-it-happen attitude" it will take five to seven years to get the supply of new homes up to a healthy level again, said Bryan Tuckey of the Building and Land Development Association (BILD). The inventory of new homes for sale in the Toronto region has sunk to historic lows, he said. There are various reasons, including lengthy provincial approval times for water and waste water servicing that's required before a single toilet can be flushed in a new neighbourhood. Figures from the Toronto Real Estate Board suggest a similar shortage exists on the resale market. People aren't listing their homes because they worry about what they'll be able to afford among the region's soaring prices. If government and builders don't figure something out soon, Toronto is heading down the road of cities like London and San Francisco, says Tuckey. "You have the most affluent parts of British society not being able to afford a home in London or in San Francisco where we see jobs being lost because people can't afford to live in communities where they want to work and play and live," he said. The census data released Wednesday reinforce his concerns, said Tuckey. It shows Toronto's population grew 6.2 per cent between 2011 and 2016, above the national average of 5 per cent. But that growth was exceeded by several communities outside the city including Brampton, Caledon, King, Markham and Bradford. For the second consecutive census, Milton has proved to be the GTA town with the biggest boom. It registered 30 per cent population growth in the census period. "We talk a lot about Toronto, and still, about 65 to 70 per cent of the growth is going to be outside Toronto. Plus, it's family oriented growth, so communities like Oakville, Brampton, Milton, Bradford, West Gwillimbury where growth was intended to happen," said Tuckey. He's not surprised that those families want what the industry calls ground-related homes — townhomes, semi-detached and detached houses. Some will happily sacrifice space for affordability. Tuckey calls townhomes the new single-family home even though they don't usually have big yards for the kids to play. To get that ground-related property, many are moving outside the city to the booming 905-area communities. In Milton, three-storey stacked townhomes and the more traditional two-storey towns with basements are the highest demand category among home buyers, said Royal LePage agent Amy Flowers, whose business is flourishing in the town that now stands at a population of just over 110,000. Those homes run between $500,000 and $600,000 on average for about 1,200 square feet of living space. Toronto buyers in search of the Holy Grail of GTA housing are typically paying between about $750,000 and $800,000 for that detached house with a yard, said Flowers. "Our buyer demographic is interesting," she said. "We're one of the only towns in the country where our median age is actually going down." In little more than a decade, the influx of families has transformed Milton. The old theatre has closed in favour of a multiplex near the highway. There's a Walmart. When Flowers moved into town about 15 years ago, it took about 10 minutes to drive across Milton. Now, with traffic, it is double that. When it comes to buying homes, Milton has its share of big-league competition. On Thursday there were only 68 freehold listings and eight condos listed on the TREB's Multiple Listings Service for Milton. Of those, four of the houses and half the condos were already conditionally sold. Like Toronto, list prices have pretty much lost any bearing on the final sale amount and competitive offers are routine, said Flowers. Buyers, who often experience the disappointment of three or four unsuccessful home bids, need to go in firm on the set offer date, advised Flowers. Home inspections are nice but they're not always possible, she said. If it all sounds familiar to Toronto's property scene, Flowers concedes one difference: "We don't have 30 offers on a house. We'll have more like five." But Milton has an edge over Toronto in that buyers don't have to pay a municipal land transfer tax. As well, the federal government's new mortgage stress test rules make it necessary for some to stretch their dollar by moving northwest of the city. It can be a long commute for downtown workers, but lots of couples use it as a halfway point between jobs in Mississauga-Brampton and Kitchener-Waterloo, she said. There is an influx of families moving in from Mississauga and Brampton, "looking for a nice safe place to raise their children," said Milton councillor Colin Best. The growth has brought some benefits, including a new hospital that is expected to open in the fall, he noted. But the supply of homes for newcomers is dire. Best said he's had realtors compare it the 1990s, before the population tripled. The town approved about 6,000 homes three years ago. They've only built 1,000. Of 11 zoning applications, only three developments are being built. Best said a lot of that is due to delays, development charges, appeals and labour turmoil in the building industry. Transportation is emerging as a big problem though. "I have people spending three hours a day commuting from Milton to Toronto," said Best. While GO has increased the number of Milton trains, he is dismayed that Metrolinx says it will be 2041 before his community gets the all-day, two-way service being rolled out in the coming decade across much of the rest of the Toronto region. "Sixty-three per cent of Halton Region goes outside the region to work. That's based on a previous census. It's probably worse now. If you come to the Milton GO train, the parking lot is full by 7:30 a.m. Twenty-five per cent of (those GO riders) are coming from the west," said Best. Don't even get him started on the rush hour traffic on Highway 401. The youth of the community has its challenges too, he said. There was a community dispute among older residents and younger families about whether the town should install a splash pad at Dorset Park. "It was quite the divide," said Best. While the province is rushing to build enough schools for the booming number of students in Milton, children are being bused and moved around in the transition. There are 16 kindergarten classes among four schools and at one point, consideration was being given to the idea of having one school just for kindergarten kids, said Best. "We've had clients who have had their kids in six different schools and sometimes the same household will have kids going to different schools," said Flowers. It's another reason to buy a resale home even though she acknowledges it's in her best interest to say so. "If you buy a resale house, that has everything all sorted and figured out. You'll know what school you're going to," she said. Besides, she adds, "If you're buying new, you're on a waiting list for a year to two years." It's just one more sign of the bifurcation of housing that has been happening in Toronto is also happening in the maturing communities surrounding the city, said Cherise Burda, executive director of the Ryerson City Building Institute. She favours the region's sweeping transit expansion. But Burda says she wonders too if some of the billions of dollars should perhaps be invested in housing closer to the city. We have a choice, she said: We can build out or we can build up. Building up is costly. Land on the periphery is cheap and municipalities make it cheaper by subsidizing infrastructure to entice the development charges new builds bring to the community. The census just shows that sprawl is continuing and opportunities are being missed, she said. "The fact that those are the economic options for developers and for home buyers shows that we're missing the types of policies to fix that," she said. The region needs more of what's called "the missing middle" — housing that falls somewhere between the highrise and the sprawl option. Before the war, families lived in flats downtown. It wasn't until after the war that the automobile spurred sprawl. In Paris and Barcelona, mid-rise apartments are the norm for family living. "We're going to buy the options we're given," said Burda. "We're not building enough infill development, we're not building enough townhouses and mid-rises — not just in downtown Toronto but also in suburban centres," she said. "If we look at downtown Toronto, 75 per cent of people walk, cycle or take transit," said Burda. The region would look very different and our lives would be better if we built homes that put people within easy access of transit and jobs. "There are all these plans for building houses in the periphery," she said. "We have enough land to keep building ground level housing for decades to come. But is that going to serve a population that doesn't want to drive to get to work?"

These three DIYs are exactly that. Whether they’re filled with love notes, candy or just come as they are, these handmade tokens of love are little reminders that someone in your life is special. I hope you have a little extra time this week (or weekend) to play around with some materials you may already have on hand and see what you come up with! Click through for instructions to make this Hanging Valentine Patch Pocket and for two more sweet Valentine’s gifts including a Custom Clipboard and a Ribbon Covered Heart that harkens back to the days when boxes of chocolates came festooned with a lot of ruffles and ribbons! –Caitlin *This post is brought to you in collaboration with Waverly Inspirations. This project, ideas, and words are from us here at D*S and were created by us, for you. Thanks for supporting our sponsors that help us create and publish original content like this. The Waverly Inspirations collection is available at Walmart. Hanging Valentine Patch Pocket Materials 2 differently patterned fabrics (We used Waverly Inspirations classic gingham and polka dot fabrics) Glue gun & glue Scissors Embroidery needle Embroidery floss or yarn Ruler Light cardboard Ribbon (We used Waverly Inspirations double ruffle edge ribbon in red and their scalloped grosgrain ribbon with white edging detail) Steps 1. Cut two 5″ x 4″ rectangles of the fabric that will be the background for the heart pocket. 2. Cut out a heart shape from the fabric you’ve chosen to be your patch pocket. Make sure it fits nicely on your background, with at least 2″ of background fabric surrounding the edge of the heart shape. (You’ll be cutting a heart shape from the background fabric too, so you’ll need room on the sides of the patch pocket.) 3. Turn your patch pocket heart shape over so that it’s right side down. Using your glue gun, apply hot glue to the edge of the heart pocket beginning at the top of right, top part of the heart, working your way around to the same spot on the left side of the heart. Be sure to leave the edge in between the two peaks of the heart shape unglued so you can actually use it as a pocket and put something in it! (Bottom line is don’t glue the entire heart on the background!) 4. Once your patch pocket heart is glued to the background, thread your needle and knot it. Start the process of sewing the patch pocket heart onto the background by bringing the needle through both the background fabric and the patch fabric from underneath. Once you’ve pierced both fabrics, pull your needle and thread all the way through until your knot stops underneath the fabric. Bring your needle just past the edge of the patch (on the background fabric) and push through to the underside. Repeat this process, left to right, from the same places on the patch heart peaks that you laid your hot glue on. Again, be sure to leave the edge in between the two peaks of the heart shape unattached so you can actually use it as a pocket and put something in it! 5. Cover one side of your cardboard with your wet glue using a paintbrush. Attach the background fabric with your attached patch pocket to the cardboard. 6. Cut an 8″ length of ribbon and match the two cut ends together and apply hot glue in between them so the ends stick together. Turn the cardboard over and apply hot glue about 2″ from the deep “V” point of the heart. Press the ribbon loop into the hot glue to attach it to the cardboard. 7. Cover the ribbon side of your cardboard with your wet glue using a paintbrush. Attach the second rectangle of background fabric to this side of the cardboard. Let dry. 8. Following the outline of the smaller patch pocket heart, cut through the cardboard, making a larger heart shape around the patch pocket heart. 9. Stuff your pocket with love notes or candy and hang in a spot to surprise someone you love! Ribbon Heart Materials Light cardboard Ribbon (We used Waverly Inspirations double ruffle edge ribbon in red and their scalloped grosgrain ribbon with white edging detail) Hot glue gun Pencil Ruler Steps Draw a line in the middle of a 5″ x 6″piece of cardboard. Cut lengths of ribbon to attach in a diagonal pattern on each side of the line. Using a hot glue gun, glue the ribbons to the cardboard on one side of the line. Repeat on the opposite of the line. Cut a heart shape out of the ribbon covered cardboard. Experiment with some more with fabric, ribbon and other embellishments. Cut hearts out of your results! Give to someone you love! P.S. These are great grouped together in a small fabric wrapped box with a sweet note. I Heart U Clipboard Materials Paintbrush (We used Waverly Inspirations 1/2″ stiff craft brush) Clipboard Craft Paint (We used: Red – Waverly Inspirations High Gloss Multi-Surface Acrylic Paint in Crimson, Silver – Waverly Inspirations Metallic Multi-Surface Acrylic Paint in Silver, White (to make light pink) – Waverly Inspirations Multi-Surface Acrylic Paint in White Opal) Stick-on letters Masking or painters tape Steps 1. Tape off an area on the clip board on the diagonal. 2. Place the letters that spell out your message in the lower right corner working right to left to make sure that all of your letters fit. If you’re using a heart in your message, cut it out and place it with tape on the back to hold it in place. 3. Trace gently around the heart if you’re using one. You’ll be painting this freehand. 4. Remove the wax paper from the adhesive on the letters and attach them to the clipboard surface. 5. Paint in between your taped diagonal area. Use two coats for maximum coverage, letting the paint dry between coats. 6. Mix different paints together to create a custom color and finish like we did here. We mixed a high gloss red with a glittered white. Use your custom color for your heart or to embellish your diagonal metallic stripe. We added high gloss red scalloped edge to our metallic edge and then dotted on our custom color to create a faux eyelet. 7. Clip a love note to the board and stash it where your Valentine will discover it! jen says: February 10, 2017 at 2:48 pm who is the green head artwork by?

January 25, 2017 Hallie Forcinio KEYWORDS convenience / party tray / tray packaging / trays Reprints No Comments If you hosted or attended any holiday gatherings as 2016 came to a close, chances are good you enjoyed the ultimate convenience: a ready-to-serve party tray. The party tray concept is more convenient than ever. Although you can still order a party tray from your favorite grocery or deli and many restaurants, grab-and-go options are proliferating. For example, Hormel Foods, based in Austin, Minn., now offers nearly a dozen stock-keeping units in its Gatherings brand. Three relatively recent additions to the Gatherings line, Culinary Pairings, combine dried fruit, nuts and cheese with slices of Italian dry salami, sopressata or hot sopressata. The rest of the Gatherings lineup consists of two party trays with two meats and two cheeses plus crackers, a larger Supreme Party Tray and five smaller snack trays. When the party starts, each rectangular tray doubles as a serving platter. A circular two-piece tray holds a ring of party-ready shrimp, distributed by Beaver Street Fisheries, Inc., in Jacksonville, Fla., and sold by Walmart, based in Bentonville, Ark. Sold frozen, the package is placed in the refrigerator to thaw overnight. Right before serving, the host removes a paperboard band and clear domed lid and then peels away the clear film covering the shrimp and the clear lidstock sealing a small tub of cocktail sauce, which rests in the center of the ring. For spur-of-the-moment gatherings, the lidstock and film are left in place, and cold water is run over the shrimp and the cocktail sauce tub to quickly thaw the two for serving.  Another tray packaging segment showing growth is vacuum skin packaging. A report published by Technavio, Elmhurst, Ill., in 2016, “Shift to Vacuum Skin Packaging Will Boost Revenues in Global Skin Packaging Market by 2020,” projects a 5 percent compound annual growth rate through 2020. Although used for other types of food and nonfood products, vacuum skin packaging is particularly popular for meat, poultry and seafood products. For example, a U.K.-based mail-order supplier of venison products, Holme Farmed Venison, uses it to protect its frozen products. Vacuum skin packaging helps lock in flavor and juices and extend shelf life as much as 30 percent versus conventional modified-atmosphere packaging. It also eliminates product discoloration and leaks for improved store presentation and enhanced food safety, imparts tamper evidence and can be coupled with easy-opening devices. Resulting packages are freezer-ready and provide high product visibility.  Meanwhile materials and tray-sealing equipment continue to evolve. On the materials side, a laminated, moisture-resistant paperboard tray offers a renewable alternative to plastic. The recyclable paperboard not only extends meat, poultry or seafood shelf life, but also boosts shelf impact. It is compatible with vacuum skin technology and easy-opening features and results in a leak-proof package. Because top and bottom surfaces can be printed, there’s no need for a label. As a result, packaging material costs drop and packaging line productivity increases. Tray sealers come in automatic and semiautomatic models and inline or standalone configurations. Many accommodate two, three, four or more lanes and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). Typical attributes include hygienic design, compact footprint, easy operation via a touch screen, speeds up to 150 trays per minute and compatibility with easy-opening and resealing features. Some vacuum skin packaging equipment applies lidstock without generating any scrap, which must be recycled or landfilled. Seal quality is assured by continual monitoring of heat, pressure and dwell time. Quick, toolless changeover reduces changeover time to a range of five to 10 minutes. On one model, an onboard carrousel shortens changeover time by holding tooling for up to four formats. When it’s time to make a change, the next tool can be preheated to further shorten downtime. Changeover tooling also may be stored on wheeled carts.  Common options include date coders, labelers, online gas analyzers for MAP, tray denesters, portioning equipment, automatic tray loaders and extended product loading areas. Instead of flat lidstock some tray sealers can accommodate a dome or lidstock equipped with a valve. A domed lid makes it possible to package a product that extends above the flange of the container in a shelf-life-extending modified atmosphere. The valve permits in-pack cooking or steam heating. Another option is multi-compartment trays which allow product from one compartment to be used while the rest of the package remains completely sealed to maintain any modified atmosphere and product shelf life. NP Did you enjoy this article?

A 36-year-old Harrisville woman entered the store with a male and a child before taking alcohol and soda to the restroom. Michigan State Police said she consumed the items without paying for them.  After exiting the restroom, police say the woman contacted a store employee about submitting an application for employment.  When the employee attempted to assist the woman with the application process, the woman grabbed the employee by the hair and ordered the employee to give her the money in the register, police said. The register was empty. The male whom the woman entered the store with then removed her from the store. Police quickly identified and located the woman. She was arrested on charges of unarmed robbery and retail fraud. Police say it is possible she could also face an assault charge stemming from the hair-pulling. The suspect was lodged at the Alpena County Jail.

RedEye Your weekend plans. Delivered. Business Analysis: Why Whole Foods is now struggling Why Whole Foods is now struggling On Feb. 8, Whole Foods reported its sixth consecutive quarter of falling same-store sales. The company is closing nine stores, according to the Washington Post, the most it has closed at one time. (Feb. 10, 2017) On Feb. 8, Whole Foods reported its sixth consecutive quarter of falling same-store sales. The company is closing nine stores, according to the Washington Post, the most it has closed at one time. (Feb. 10, 2017) Caitlin DeweyWashington Post Organic food has never been so popular among American consumers. Ironically, that's bad news for the brand that made organic a household name — namely, Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods Market. On Wednesday, Whole Foods reported what is arguably its worst performance in a decade, announcing its sixth consecutive quarter of falling same-store sales and cutting its outlook for the year. The company is closing nine stores, the most it has ever closed at one time. A mere 16 months ago, Whole Foods predicted it would grow its 470 U.S. locations to more than 1,200. The problem is one that CEO John Mackey probably didn't predict when he first opened Whole Foods as a neighborhood natural foods store 36 years ago: Organics, then a fringe interest, have become so thoroughly mainstream that organic chains now have to face conventional big-box competitors. Mass-market retailers were responsible for 53.3 percent of organic food sales in 2015, according to the Organic Trade Association; natural retailers clocked in just north of 37. And Whole Foods is hardly the only store feeling the squeeze: Sprouts and Fresh Market, the second- and third-largest publicly traded organic stores, also have seen falling stock prices. "Whole Foods created this space and had it to all to themselves for years," said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones. "But in the past five years, a lot of people started piling in. And now there's a lot of competition." In many ways, the story of Whole Food's decline is also the story of how the organic movement took over America. Between 2005 and 2015, sales of organic food increased 209 percent, according to the Organic Trade Association. Last year, organic sales topped $43.3 billion. The driving force behind this growth, most analysts agree, is none other than millennials: Consumers aged 18 to 34 are the largest buyers of organics, and they're the most likely to consider themselves "knowledgeable" about their food. As they came of age, mainstream grocery chains have been forced to adapt too. A multinational food company likely owns your favorite organic brand Peter Whoriskey One of the essential questions of the organic movement is, "What foods are worthy of the USDA 'organic' label?" The legal definition of the word is hammered down in semi-annual meetings, one of which was held last week, that involve a federal advisory board and people working in the organic industry.... One of the essential questions of the organic movement is, "What foods are worthy of the USDA 'organic' label?" The legal definition of the word is hammered down in semi-annual meetings, one of which was held last week, that involve a federal advisory board and people working in the organic industry.... (Peter Whoriskey) Wal-Mart ramped up its organics selection in 2006. Kroger introduced its Simple Truth brand in 2012 — the store's CEO Mike Ellis later said it was the store's "most successful brand launch ever." Earlier this week, Aldi announced plans for a $1.6 billion U.S. expansion, with much of that growth aimed at offering "a wider range of organic and gluten-free products." By volume, the largest organic retailer in the U.S. is currently believed to be Costco — which in 2015 sold $4 billion of organic produce and packaged foods. Like Walmart, Kroger and Aldi, Costco sells organic produce for considerably cheaper than do natural food stores, farmer's markets or Whole Foods. In fact, lowering prices has been one of Whole Food's primary strategies for dealing with competitors. Apart from shuttering stores and stalling expansion plans, the company is continuing to focus on "365 by Whole Foods," a 2-year-old division aimed at launching stores for "value-conscious" consumers. It's also been dropping prices at its regular locations and mailing out national discount circulars, something it had not previously done. Speaking to investors on Wednesday, Mackey indicated that he did not want to see "too big of a gap" between the prices at Whole Foods and those at stores like Costco and Kroger. But some organic advocates are concerned that lowering the prices of organic foods — an apparent prerequisite for mainstream popularity — can only happen at the expense of the movement's early principles. This fear is not entirely new: Michael Pollan fretted about it in the pages of The New York Times when Wal-Mart began selling organic Rice Krispies Treats 11 years ago. But with results like Whole Foods, it is becoming more urgent, said Ronnie Cummins, the co-founder of the Organic Consumers Association. Cummins points out that some of the most successful, most mainstream organic products don't meet his organization's strict definition of what organic should be. Those include the ubiquitous Earthbound Farms, which grows its lettuces in monocultures, and Aurora Organic Dairy, which has been criticized for running its operation like an industrial factory farm. "If you're a publicly traded corporation, you have no choice but to maximize short-term profits," Cummins said. "But we are going to be complaining to Whole Foods if they decrease their quality to keep up with the competition." That approach may be most profitable now, he acknowledges — but Whole Foods needs to think long-term. After all, when the company was founded, there was barely even a market for organic foods.

(AP) — Eight months later, Coastal Carolina’s surprise run to the national championship in its first College World Series appearance still resonates in eastern South Carolina. “It not only has changed our program, it’s changed our university,” coach Gary Gilmore said. “I’ve been here 21 years, and at no time have I seen groups of people so proud to wear our gear, put our sticker on their car. You go to Wal-Mart and there are 10 or 12 people walking around with our gear on where in the past it’s been all Clemson and South Carolina stuff.” All those new fans, along with the old ones, want to know what the Chanticleers will do for an encore. Coastal Carolina led the nation with 96 home runs last season, and players accounting for 79 of them are gone. Only three everyday players are back, but the weekend rotation returns, including CWS Most Outstanding Player Andrew Beckwith. So does star reliever Bobby Holmes. January retirement numbers fall short of dire, post-election preditions “The expectations are every bit equal to last year,” Gilmore said. “The way we have to go about it may be a little bit different as far as how we put our team together and what the team’s skill sets allow us to do. The goal is the same. It’s to get back to Omaha. The one thing I did find out is that if you get there, anything can happen.” Advertisement Seth Lancaster, who missed the CWS after getting hurt in super regionals, moves from second base to third. He hit seven home runs, most of any returning player. “We’re not going to hit 108 home runs,” Gilmore said, “but I think we’ll hit more than people give us credit for.” The Chanticleers plan to be more aggressive on the bases. Billy Cooke is back after stealing a team-leading 27 bases. The Chanticleers finished with 112, and Gilmore said this team should be capable of 150. Beckwith (15-1, 1.85 ERA) led the nation in wins, threw two complete games in the CWS and was the winner in the title-clinching victory against Arizona. Alex Cunningham (10-4, 3.62) and Jason Bilous (3-1, 4.43) are the other weekend starters. Holmes (7-2, 4.20) is the bullpen ace. Newcomers Wood Myers at second base, Jordan Gore at shortstop and Cory Wood in left field will join the lineup. Myers played at a junior college last season after spending two years at North Carolina, Gore transferred from South Carolina and Wood was one of the top high school players in North Carolina last year. The Chanticleers will play their first season in the Sun Belt Conference after moving from the Big South. “We can’t come out and play passive and say, ‘Hey, we did this last year so it’s going to be given to us,’ ” Beckwith said. “Everyone is going to (target) us. I think the Sun Belt is a little bit better competition, and our guys need to embrace it.” Some things to know: NEW COACHES There are 30 new head coaches in Division I.

MUST WATCH H&R Block CEO: Trump is right about tax reform 02:33 Story highlights Tax policymaking entails a series of trade-offs, David M. Smick says Smick: If Trump delivers on tax reform, he'll have to make some hard political choices David M. Smick is chairman and CEO of the macroeconomic advisory firm Johnson Smick International and founder and editor of the International Economy magazine. His new book is "The Great Equalizer: How Main Street Capitalism Can Create an Economy for Everyone." The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN)Facing fierce criticism from the right on fiscal policy, President Donald Trump has developed a new sense of urgency. In an interview last weekend with Fox's Bill O'Reilly, when asked if Americans should expect a tax cut this year, instead of saying something along the lines of "yes, absolutely," Trump offered the more restrained, "I think so ... before the end of the year. I would like to say yes." David M. Smick Such an expression of caution is unusual for the 45th President. Yet Thursday, Trump suddenly shifted gears, promising to announce a "phenomenal" tax reform proposal in an amazingly short two to three weeks. Reforming the tax code is likely to be far more politically complicated than the Trump officials, most of whom are new to Washington, think. As a congressional staff aide and later an outside adviser, I worked on both the 1981 and 1986 tax reform packages. The process of seeking a consensus was difficult and time-consuming. In the case of the 1986 tax reform, it took years to resolve some serious differences. Trump will face a similar challenge in a much more compressed time period. Announcements are easy to make. Actually enacting tax reform is a lot more difficult. How liberals should spend their Trump-gotten gains (opinion) The details of the President's plan have yet to be announced, but a rough outline exists. The outline largely reflects the House Republican tax reform plan. And the answer to two questions will likely determine the success of the overall effort: Read More First, will the Senate (and perhaps even some House Republicans) kill the House's proposal for a border adjustment tax (which produces an estimated $1.4 trillion in new revenue over 10 years, the amount roughly needed for Trump's infrastructure spending and military modernization)? The new proposed border-adjusted tax system would place a 20% tax on imports while eliminating the corporate income tax. It is being heavily attacked by US importers, Walmart, Koch Industries and foreign governments. Proponents argue that US companies, by not having to pay taxes on exports, would for the first time face a level playing field in tax policy relative to their global competition. Second, will the Senate accept the House's use of "dynamic scoring" in determining the budget implications of tax reform? Dynamic scoring assumes tax incentives have some effect in creating greater tax revenue. Critics charge that dynamic scoring is "funny math." Proponents use the analogy of a small business. "If you expand your sales budget by $100,000, you wouldn't expect sales revenues to stay the same," they argue. Is GOP really softening on Obamacare? (opinion) Here's why these questions are relevant: If dynamic scoring is accepted, tax reform will include the immediate expensing for tax purposes of all capital investment, a huge stimulus for business expansion. As one congressional leader told me, "If there is no dynamic scoring, expensing is out," because the static revenue loss (on paper) as a result of the stimulus would not comply with the 10-year budget restrictions previously set by Congress. By the same token, if there is no border adjustment tax, the Trump fiscal stimulus is likely to be significantly smaller than originally envisioned. US tax policy will change, but there may be nothing "phenomenal" about the final result. Making tax policymaking entails a series of trade-offs. If the choice is between a border adjustment tax versus Trump's reckless call for 35% or higher tariffs aimed at US trade competitors, the choice is clear. Tariffs would risk a global trade war and almost certain worldwide recession. The border adjustment alternative would likely be consistent with the rules of the World Trade Organization and would not lead necessarily to trade retaliation. The US corporate tax system would not be dissimilar to the value-added tax systems used elsewhere in the world to the disadvantage of American companies. Wall tax idea on Mexico is illegal and would hurt US (Opinion) But here's the ultimate question: Is the President's call for tariffs the opening bid in an elaborate effort to strike a deal on a border adjustment tax he wanted all along? In other words, by threatening the world with tariffs, does the border adjustment tax (and its $1.4 trillion in new revenue) become the reasonable and safe alternative? Or is the new President not that clever? When all is said and done, one thing is certain about tax policy: All policy changes produce unintended economic and political consequences. That's why enacting a border adjustment tax is hardly a sure thing. Finally, there is the issue of Trump's promise of individual tax rate reduction. Some of the administration's economic advisers have suggested the personal tax reductions be separated from the corporate tax stimulus, with the personal tax code to be addressed at a later time. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook Here's the problem: More than 80% of businesses in the United States use so-called "pass-throughs" to pay their taxes -- proprietorships, partnerships, Subchapter S organizations that all pay their taxes using the personal income tax schedules. Unless these firms are part of the corporate tax reform plan, small businesses and startups, which are already at a disadvantage relative to large corporations because of the complexity of the tax code, will fall further behind. The upshot is that many Democrats in Congress are open to supporting a plan that reforms the inefficient corporate tax system. Few Democrats will support a plan for individual tax rate reduction. Here's the problem: Can a President who won by promising support for the Rust Belt's "forgotten man" really agree to a plan that delays tax rate cuts for the middle class and pushes fiscal stimulus for the corporate class?

Sears to cut $1 billion in costs, reduce debt and pension obligations by $1.5 billion Reuters 11 hrs ago (…) Daniel Acker a 2013 photo shows shoppers walking toward a Sears store in Peoria, Ill. Getting long-struggling Sears to stop bleeding cash has been about as easy as closing the U.S. military prison in Cuba, according to Chief Executive Officer Edward Lampert. MUST CREDIT: Bloomberg photo byu Daniel Acker. Sears Holdings Corp. said Friday that it would cut costs by $1 billion and reduce debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion this year. The announcement sent the struggling retailer’s shares up by as much as 40 percent before settling at $6.96, up 26 percent. The company also said it had sold five Sears full-line stores and two Auto Centers for $72.5 million in January, and had engaged Eastdil Secured to raise at least $1 billion from the sale of its real estate. Once the largest U.S. retailer, Sears has struggled with years of losses and declining sales as shoppers shift online or to rivals such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. On Friday, the company estimated its sixth straight quarterly loss, with comparable store sales falling 10.3 percent during the all-important holiday selling season. Sears has spun off some of its stores into a real estate investment trust, put some brands on sale and repeatedly raised debt from billionaire Chief Executive Edward Lampert’s hedge fund as part of efforts to cope with the slump. Under the latest plan, the company said it would consolidate Sears and Kmart’s corporate and support functions and improve product assortment at its stores. Some measures outlined on Friday, such as inventory management, monetizing real estate assets and using data generated from its Shop Your Way membership program to understand customer preferences, have been part of previous cost-cutting exercises.

Sears did not specify if the latest cost-saving plan would involve job cuts. It was too early in the restructuring process to discuss potential staff reductions, a source close to the company said. Sears said it would use proceeds from asset sales, improving profitability and working capital management to reduce its debt and pension obligations by $1.5 billion in fiscal 2017. The company had pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities of $2 billion and long-term debt of $3.7 billion as of Oct. 29. Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    The investment adage that gold is a safe haven for investors in times of trouble is only a cliché because it remains to be true.  Frank Holmes, CEO and chief investment officer at U.S. Global Investors, says investors are buying gold by relying on simple investment-related math, USA Today reported Holmes also explained that investors are also bracing for unsavory ripple effects if Trump’s plan to slap tariffs on U.S. trading partners like China hurts U.S. consumers by resulting in higher prices of imported goods sold at U.S. stores such as Walmart, Target and Home Depot. “The collateral damage could be massive to economic growth,” Holmes says. Holding gold – which does not pay interest – has become more attractive due to the combination of lower bond yields and higher inflation readings, Holmes told USA Today. “When the real interest rate -- the rate of interest on, say, a 5-year U.S. government bond minus inflation – shrinks or turns negative as it has done lately, investors tend to buy gold as they're not missing out on the yield benefit of bonds,” USA Today explained. Five reasons USA Today cited as to why savvy investors should continue to invest in gold: Economic policy uncertainty in the U.S. under President Trump. Political anxiety surrounding the populist movement in Europe and elsewhere. Ongoing stimulus from global central bankers. Angst over rising inflation. The U.S. dollar falling in value versus foreign currencies. However, not all economic gurus are in agreement about how buying gold fits into the brave new world of a Trump presidency. "We’ve seen some market strategists recommend owning gold in the event that Trump causes World War III. Unlike potassium iodide, gold isn’t an antidote to radiation exposure," Newsmax Finance Insider Ed Yardeni recently explained. "But it might provide great protection from a number of lesser calamities that Trump’s detractors believe he might cause, including a global trade war or a domestic civil war," Yardeni wrote. "Our new president has hit the ground running, but there’s probably more mud than he expected," Yardeni wrote. "Gold might rally if he stumbles badly. Or else it might rally because Trump’s policies boost economic growth, as he promised. If so, the rebound in commodity prices that started at the end of 2015 may continue." Dr. Ed Yardeni is the President of Yardeni Research, Inc., a provider of independent global investment strategy research. (Newsmax wire services contributed to this report).

Share on Facebook A A Report an Error Share via Email Print The Canadian Press A new townhouse complex is under construction in Toronto on Thursday, November 3, 2016. By: Staff Torstar News Service Published on There’s a housing supply shortage looming in the Toronto area. That’s the warning the head of the association for new home builders has been issuing every chance he gets in recent months. Even with a “making-it-happen attitude” it will take five to seven years to get the supply of new homes up to a healthy level again, said Bryan Tuckey of the Building and Land Development Association (BILD). The inventory of new homes for sale in the Toronto region has sunk to historic lows, he said. There are various reasons, including lengthy provincial approval times for water and waste water servicing that’s required before a single toilet can be flushed in a new neighbourhood. Figures from the Toronto Real Estate Board suggest a similar shortage exists on the resale market. People aren’t listing their homes because they worry about what they’ll be able to afford among the region’s soaring prices. If government and builders don’t figure something out soon, Toronto is heading down the road of cities like London and San Francisco, says Tuckey. “You have the most affluent parts of British society not being able to afford a home in London or in San Francisco where we see jobs being lost because people can’t afford to live in communities where they want to work and play and live,” he said. The census data released Wednesday reinforce his concerns, said Tuckey. It shows Toronto’s population grew 6.2 per cent between 2011 and 2016, above the national average of 5 per cent. But that growth was exceeded by several communities outside the city including Brampton, Caledon, King, Markham and Bradford. For the second consecutive census, Milton has proved to be the GTA town with the biggest boom. It registered 30 per cent population growth in the census period. “We talk a lot about Toronto, and still, about 65 to 70 per cent of the growth is going to be outside Toronto. Plus, it’s family oriented growth, so communities like Oakville, Brampton, Milton, Bradford, West Gwillimbury where growth was intended to happen,” said Tuckey. He’s not surprised that those families want what the industry calls ground-related homes — townhomes, semi-detached and detached houses. Some will happily sacrifice space for affordability. Tuckey calls townhomes the new single-family home even though they don’t usually have big yards for the kids to play. To get that ground-related property, many are moving outside the city to the booming 905-area communities. In Milton, three-storey stacked townhomes and the more traditional two-storey towns with basements are the highest demand category among home buyers, said Royal LePage agent Amy Flowers, whose business is flourishing in the town that now stands at a population of just over 110,000. Those homes run between $500,000 and $600,000 on average for about 1,200 square feet of living space. Toronto buyers in search of the holy grail of GTA housing are typically paying between about $750,000 and $800,000 for that detached house with a yard, said Flowers. “Our buyer demographic is interesting,” she said. “We’re one of the only towns in the country where our median age is actually going down.” In little more than a decade, the influx of families has transformed Milton. The old theatre has closed in favour of a multiplex near the highway. There’s a Wal-Mart. When Flowers moved into town about 15 years ago, it took about 10 minutes to drive across Milton. Now, with traffic, it is double that. When it comes to buying homes, Milton has its share of big-league competition. On Thursday there were only 68 freehold listings and eight condos listed on the TREB’s Multiple Listings Service for Milton. Of those, four of the houses and half the condos were already conditionally sold. Like Toronto, list prices have pretty much lost any bearing on the final sale amount and competitive offers are routine, said Flowers. Buyers, who often experience the disappointment of three or four unsuccessful home bids, need to go in firm on the set offer date, advised Flowers. Home inspections are nice but they’re not always possible, she said. If it all sounds familiar to Toronto’s property scene, Flowers concedes one difference: “We don’t have 30 offers on a house. We’ll have more like five.” But Milton has an edge over Toronto in that buyers don’t have to pay a municipal land transfer tax. As well, the federal government’s new mortgage stress test rules make it necessary for some to stretch their dollar by moving northwest of the city. It can be a long commute for downtown workers, but lots of couples use it as a halfway point between jobs in Mississauga-Brampton and Kitchener-Waterloo, she said. There is an influx of families moving in from Mississauga and Brampton, “looking for a nice safe place to raise their children,” said Milton councillor Colin Best. The growth has brought some benefits, including a new hospital that is expected to open in the fall, he noted. But the supply of homes for newcomers is dire. Best said he’s had realtors compare it the 1990s, before the population tripled. The town approved about 6,000 homes three years ago. They’ve only built 1,000. Of 11 zoning applications, only three developments are being built. Best said a lot of that is due to delays, development charges, appeals and labour turmoil in the building industry. Transportation is emerging as a big problem though. “I have people spending three hours a day commuting from Milton to Toronto,” said Best. While GO has increased the number of Milton trains, he is dismayed that Metrolinx says it will be 2041 before his community gets the all-day, two-way service being rolled out in the coming decade across much of the rest of the Toronto region. “Sixty-three per cent of Halton Region goes outside the region to work. That’s based on a previous census. It’s probably worse now. If you come to the Milton GO train, the parking lot is full by 7:30 a.m. Twenty-five per cent of (those GO riders) are coming from the west,” said Best. Don’t even get him started on the rush hour traffic on Highway 401. The youth of the community has its challenges too, he said. There was a community dispute among older residents and younger families about whether the town should install a splash pad at Dorset Park. “It was quite the divide,” said Best. While the province is rushing to build enough schools for the booming number of students in Milton, children are being bused and moved around in the transition. There are 16 kindergarten classes among four schools and at one point, consideration was being given to the idea of having one school just for kindergarten kids, said Best. “We’ve had clients who have had their kids in six different schools and sometimes the same household will have kids going to different schools,” said Flowers. It’s another reason to buy a resale home even though she acknowledges it’s in her best interest to say so. “If you buy a resale house, that has everything all sorted and figured out. You’ll know what school you’re going to,” she said. Besides, she adds, “If you’re buying new, you’re on a waiting list for a year to two years.” It’s just one more sign of the bifurcation of housing that has been happening in Toronto is also happening in the maturing communities surrounding the city, said Cherise Burda, executive director of the Ryerson City Building Institute. She favours the region’s sweeping transit expansion. But Burda says she wonders too if some of the billions of dollars should perhaps be invested in housing closer to the city. We have a choice, she said: We can build out or we can build up. Building up is costly. Land on the periphery is cheap and municipalities make it cheaper by subsidizing infrastructure to entice the development charges new builds bring to the community. The census just shows that sprawl is continuing and opportunities are being missed, she said. “The fact that those are the economic options for developers and for home buyers shows that we’re missing the types of policies to fix that,” she said. The region needs more of what’s called “the missing middle” — housing that falls somewhere between the highrise and the sprawl option. Before the war, families lived in flats downtown. It wasn’t until after the war that the automobile spurred sprawl. In Paris and Barcelona, mid-rise apartments are the norm for family living. “We’re going to buy the options we’re given,” said Burda. “We’re not building enough infill development, we’re not building enough townhouses and mid-rises — not just in downtown Toronto but also in suburban centres,” she said. “If we look at downtown Toronto, 75 per cent of people walk, cycle or take transit,” said Burda. The region would look very different and our lives would be better if we built homes that put people within easy access of transit and jobs. “There are all these plans for building houses in the periphery,” she said. “We have enough land to keep building ground level housing for decades to come. But is that going to serve a population that doesn’t want to drive to get to work?” Editors' Picks Video: The world's biggest aircraft ready to fly after crash-landing Air Canada goes vintage with total airline makeover Man stuck for hours in muddy pond with just his nose above the surface Video: Dog Wick sees John Wick's pup revenge-killing Most Popular ‘Settler, please:’ B.C.’s racist historical signs have got to go, argues archaeologist It’s clear now — The already-rich Trumps just want to get richer Pucker up: Halifax Mooseheads proving a little affection can go a long way Five people facing charges after loaded guns, drugs found in Cole Harbour residence Toronto Views More...

Customers Pam King and her son Rhys, 2, shop for organic groceries at Whole Foods Market Arroyo Parkway store in Pasadena, Calif. in this Nov. 7, 2007 file photo. While Whole Foods led the organic food craze in the U.S., mainstream grocery chains have jumped on board as more and more people began buying organic. Damian Dovarganes Associated Press i By Caitlin Dewey The Washington Post LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Organic food has never been so popular among American consumers. Ironically, that's bad news for the brand that made organic a household name - namely, the Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods. On Wednesday, Whole Foods reported what is arguably its worst performance in a decade, announcing its sixth consecutive quarter of falling same-store sales and cutting its outlook for the year. The company is closing nine stores, the most it has ever closed at one time. A mere 16 months ago, Whole Foods predicted it would grow its 470 U.S. locations to more than 1,200. The problem is one that chief executive John Mackey probably didn't predict when he first opened Whole Foods as a neighborhood natural foods store 36 years ago: Organics, then a fringe interest, have become so thoroughly mainstream that organic chains now have to face conventional big-box competitors. Mass-market retailers were responsible for 53.3 percent of organic food sales in 2015, according to the Organic Trade Association; natural retailers clocked in just north of 37. And Whole Foods is hardly the only store feeling the squeeze: Sprouts and Fresh Market, the second- and third-largest publicly traded organic stores, have also seen falling stock prices. "Whole Foods created this space and had it to all to themselves for years," said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones. "But in the past five years, a lot of people started piling in. And now there's a lot of competition." facebook twitter email Share More Videos 5:03 Miami doctor 'removed from all clinical duties' following attack on Uber driver Pause 2:23 One arrest as protesters block DeVos from D.C. middle school 2:32 Melania Trump's focus as First Lady is to end cyberbullying 8:39 Boy Scouts executive: 'We have not lost our way' 2:41 Heat's Goran Dragic says there's only one other player in the league as versatile as James Johnson 2:30 Heat's James Johnson goes for season-high 26 points in win at Brooklyn 1:47 President Donald Trump's Guantánamo 2:08 Critics thrown out of the County Commission chambers 1:33 Dutch water-management expert advises on sea-level-rise in Miami 0:50 Dion Waiters speaks to media after last-second shot beats Golden State Warriors Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Do we live in one of America’s unhealthiest states?

(Natalie Fertig / McClatchy) In many ways, the story of Whole Food's decline is also the story of how the organic movement took over America. Between 2005 and 2015, sales of organic food increased 209 percent, according to the Organic Trade Association. Last year, organic sales topped $43.3 billion. The driving force behind this growth, most analysts agree, is none other than Millennials: Consumers aged 18 to 34 are the largest buyers of organics, and they're the most likely to consider themselves "knowledgeable" about their food. As they came of age, mainstream grocery chains have been forced to adapt, too. Walmart ramped up its organics selection in 2006. Kroger introduced its Simple Truth brand in 2012 {mdash} the store's CEO Mike Ellis later said it was the store's "most successful brand launch ever." Earlier this week, Aldi announced plans for a $1.6-billion U.S. expansion, with much of that growth aimed at offering "a wider range of organic and gluten-free products." facebook twitter email Share More Videos 5:03 Miami doctor 'removed from all clinical duties' following attack on Uber driver Pause 2:23 One arrest as protesters block DeVos from D.C. middle school 2:32 Melania Trump's focus as First Lady is to end cyberbullying 8:39 Boy Scouts executive: 'We have not lost our way' 2:41 Heat's Goran Dragic says there's only one other player in the league as versatile as James Johnson 2:30 Heat's James Johnson goes for season-high 26 points in win at Brooklyn 1:47 President Donald Trump's Guantánamo 2:08 Critics thrown out of the County Commission chambers 1:33 Dutch water-management expert advises on sea-level-rise in Miami 0:50 Dion Waiters speaks to media after last-second shot beats Golden State Warriors Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email How to spot GMOs on your grocery store shelf Scott Faber of the Environmental Working Group, an organization pushing for GMO labels on food packaging, shares some tips for finding items on grocery store shelves that contain genetically modified organisms (GMO). As Vice President of Government Affair By volume, the largest organic retailer in the U.S. is currently believed to be Costco - which in 2015 sold $4 billion of organic produce and packaged foods. Like Walmart, Kroger and Aldi, Costco sells organic produce for considerably cheaper than do natural food stores, farmer's markets or Whole Foods. In fact, lowering prices has been one of Whole Food's primary strategies for dealing with competitors. Apart from shuttering stores and stalling expansion plans, the company is continuing to focus on "365 by Whole Foods," a two-year-old division aimed at launching stores for "value-conscious" consumers. It's also been dropping prices at its regular locations and mailing out national discount circulars, something it had not previously done. Speaking to investors on Wednesday, Mackey indicated that he did not want to see "too big of a gap" between the prices at Whole Foods and those at stores like Costco and Kroger. But some organic advocates are concerned that lowering the prices of organic foods - an apparent prerequisite for mainstream popularity - can only happen at the expense of the movement's early principles. This fear is not entirely new: Michael Pollan fretted about it in the pages of The New York Times when Walmart began selling organic Rice Krispie treats 11 years ago. But with results like Whole Foods, it is becoming more urgent, said Ronnie Cummins, the co-founder of the Organic Consumers Association. Cummins points out that some of the most successful, most mainstream organic products don't meet his organization's strict definition of what organic should be. Those include the ubiquitous Earthbound Farms, which grows its lettuces in monocultures, and Aurora Organic Dairy, which has been criticized for running its operation like an industrial factory farm. "If you're a publicly traded corporation, you have no choice but to maximize short-term profits," Cummins said. "But we are going to be complaining to Whole Foods if they decrease their quality to keep up with the competition." That approach may be most profitable now, he acknowledges - but Whole Foods needs to think long-term. After all, when the company was founded, there was barely even a market for organic foods.

Time Shoppers walk into Sears in Peabody, Mass. (Photo: Elise Amendola, AP) 10 CONNECTTWEET 17 LINKEDIN 41 COMMENTEMAILMORE No one should celebrate the slow-motion demise of once-venerable retailer Sears Holdings, but it's been a long time since the department store was where America shopped. And because Sears and its sister company Kmart are merely shells of their former selves after they destroyed so much value over the years for employees, customers, and investors, there may be a group of stakeholders secretly hoping the end comes soon: shopping malls. Store closings: Macy's is closing these 68 stores Is your local Sears or Kmart among 150 stores to be axed? See the list What happens when Kmart and Macy's close? Anchored to the past Anchor stores were once the lifeblood of the shopping mall, drawing both customers and other tenants. But retail and the malls have changed a lot since then, and anchor stores today exist more in name only. Consumers are more likely to shop the smaller retailers in the mall than stop in at the big department stores. The chains themselves realize this, which is why they're closing down hundreds of stores. Macy's announced in August it would be closing 100 stores in early 2017, on top of the dozens of others it closed over the past few years. J.C. Penney has closed 74 stores over the past two years. Kohl's closed 18 stores in 2016. Walmart said a year ago it would be closing 154 stores in the U.S., though most were its small-footprint Express stores. Real estate information firm CoStar has estimated nearly 1 billion square feet of retail space will need to be "rationalized" over the next few years. This could take the form of store closures, conversion to another use, or "rent roll downs." CoStar has reported that annual department-store retail sales tumbled 28% from their peak in 1999 to 2015. Sales per square foot have reportedly fallen to $330 from $350 a decade ago and many retailers want to get a break on the rent they pay. Certainly, mall operators such as General Growth Properties, Simon Property Group, and Macerich might agree to rent reductions for some of their tenants to help them survive the transition of retail from physical locations to online -- some analysts estimate half of all retail sales may come from the online channel by 2030 -- but they might also be rooting for anchors like Sears Holdings to go bankrupt so they can rent the space for more money. Getting more Seritage Growth Properties, the real estate investment trust that Sears Holdings Chairman and CEO Eddie Lampert created in 2015 to serve as the vehicle to help the retailer monetize its asset portfolio, is making a mint off the company's woes. The REIT is taking Sears stores and carving them up into smaller parcels and renting out the space to other retailers like Dick's Sporting Goods, Petsmart, and outlet department stores such as Nordstrom Rack and Saks Off 5th. But where a Sears or Kmart store paid bargain-basement rents of just $4.39 per square foot, it's turning around and jacking the rents up on the new tenants. According to the REIT's last quarterly SEC filing, Seritage is getting rent that averages $12.24 per square foot, while on the most recent leases it's signed with tenants who haven't yet moved in -- some 55 leases in all -- it is getting $19.25 per square foot. Sears is also doing that with some of its stores, leasing out space to third-party retailers, and Macy's has entered into a strategic alliance with Brookfield Asset Management to map out a "predevelopment plan" for half of the 100 stores it will be closing. Don't let the door hit you on the way out This was obviously a good deal for Seritage, but it does come with substantial risk because the REIT's operations are predicated on Sears' continuing to exist and pay it rent, which it uses to finance its redevelopment projects. A bankruptcy by the retailer could cause the whole strategy to implode. Not necessarily so with the malls that Sears and Kmart occupy. While a Sears Holdings bankruptcy might lead malls to suddenly face the prospect of being flooded with zombie retail space, they would have the chance to redevelop the stores themselves and attract new tenants who would pay them, and not Seritage, significantly higher rents. Of course, a Sears Holdings bankruptcy carries risks for them, too. As noted, many retailers are reducing their footprints, not expanding them, so filling up the space may not be so simple, and for malls not in desirable locations, Sears Holdings' demise could be catastrophic. Credit Suisse says some 184 malls can be classified as "least valuable property" -- meaning at risk of shutting down -- and, concernedly, Sears is the anchor store in 110 of them. A Sears Holdings bankruptcy and the wave of store closings that would follow could very well jeopardize their existence. Even so, Seritage reports that its stores enjoy a 99.3% occupancy rate. Of course, that's because most of the properties are still occupied by Sears, but its experience demonstrates there is pent-up demand for the retailer's vacated stores. In fact, in 31 properties, Seritage has joint venture agreements with the mall operators themselves, so they're already realizing some of the benefits from Sears Holdings' slow death. An orderly exit would likely produce the best result for everyone involved, but if Sears Holdings' precarious financial situation finally overwhelms it, you might not find as many mall operators lamenting the outcome as expected.

Special to the Reporter-HeraldJosh and Zora Tabin, owners of Loveland-based Wild Zora Foods, talk with a panel of experts during the filming of the “Hatched” TV show. The episode featuring Wild Zora is airing in February where the show is available. An all-natural meat-and-veggie snack manufactured in downtown Loveland is getting a tryout with the Walmart system. Wild Zora Foods, which makes healthy, high-protein bars that are gluten-, milk-, soy-, nut-free and added-sugar free, was recently featured on the nationally syndicated TV show “Hatched.” The program connects entrepreneurs with mentors, investors and corporate bigwigs. As a result of their appearance on “Hatched” this month, Wild Zora owners Josh and Zora Tabin popped onto the radar of the world’s largest retailer and will get an audition to get their products on Sam’s Club shelves. The couple will give presentations at Sam’s Club stores for 20 days, and if they sell enough Wild Zora bars, “then there’s a bigger conversation,” Josh Tabin said. The mom-and-pop operation launched less than three years ago after Zora Tabin worked to create a snack for their two young children that didn’t contain grains and added sugar. The bars are made from just meat, vegetables, a little fruit and some spices, mixed and dehydrated into healthful snacks. The bars are easier to chew than jerky and don’t have added chemicals. They come in flavors such as chili beef bars with kale, apricot and cayenne pepper and curry masala turkey bars with spinach, dates and cardamom. Two new flavors have been submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for approval: pork taco and apple pork. Wild Zora bars are sold in more than 700 stores.

(View our Privacy Policy) We'll help to figure out what in the world is going on By Douglas L. McElhaney, special to the Tampa Bay Times DOUGLAS L. MCELHANEYTampa Bay Times Friday, February 10, 2017 11:51am Print 0 My Edition I want to see more articles tagged I'm already following articles tagged Previous Next Previous Next Editor's note: In advance of this week's fifth annual St. Petersburg Conference on World Affairs, several of the experts who will participate have written essays for today's Perspective about key areas of concern: Russia, Turkey, the European Union and the Mideast, among them. Related News/Archive 3M, others figuring out what makes millennial workers tick 5 Months Ago The atmosphere has hit a grim milestone — and scientists say we'll never go back 'within our lifetimes' 8 Months Ago We can help shape how we look, despite genetics 7 Months Ago Frustration has grown with years of political stalemate in Washington. So America elected a political outsider who brazenly calls for America First. President Donald Trump wants to bring back manufacturing jobs and make the Europeans pay for their own defense. The establishment has been dealt a severe blow, and the little guy — not just the American variant — wants results. Unsure of our nation's trajectory, we may need some answers, and fast. But tweets are not policy, and a complicated animal like our many-tentacled government needs a road map. To help understand what in the world is going on, join us this week at the fifth annual St. Petersburg Conference on World Affairs. (See box on page 4P for details.) As demonstrators protest new immigration bans, let's remember how Congress in 1925 severely restricted southern and eastern Europeans ­— because they were getting too numerous and didn't really seem "American." Jews prior to World War II had little hope of making it to New York harbor. Times are changing. Drive across Florida or go to a building site and you will see, or — actually — hear a new America in the non-English languages being spoken. Go to Walmart and note that the cheapest products are produced in low-wage countries. Some might recall hearing that "what was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa." Should we punish big American multinationals who move overseas to produce goods more cheaply? Should we try to thwart the basic economics we learned in school that lower trade barriers and freer movement of labor means cheaper products for everyone? Calls to take back our country are not unique to the United States. They are heard across the Atlantic. The majority of British voters have directed their government to exit the European Union. The French people may elect Marine Le Pen as their next president. She calls for severe restrictions on immigration and breaking out of regulatory regimes written in Brussels. The left-wing populist Podemos Party in Spain and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement in Italy (co-founded by a comic-turned-politician) want something new and less complicated. Meantime, conservative Polish and Hungarian leaders bristle at accepting the more secular mores of their West European partners. All the while, refugee flows snake through the Balkans toward the wealthiest societies of Europe, where (sometimes) jobs await. Is the new normal now the globalists vs. the protectors of national sovereignty? Is Vladimir Putin really up for a reset of relations with the United States? The last administration tried and it didn't work. Perhaps we can find common ground with Russia on issues like terrorism, but Moscow does things differently, owing to its very different history. Russian government is non-representative, and when Muslims revolt within their borders, Moscow ruthlessly suppresses them. The economy is a kleptocrat's dream, operating through informal and non-transparent channels to the advantage of the ruling clique. Russian foreign policy is to crush revolt in Syria, destabilize Ukraine and take back (as they say) the Crimea. Speaking of the new normal, will our tried and true NATO alliance uphold its treaty obligation to the Baltic states and others to resist Russian aggression? Turkey, a formidable military power within NATO, is moving less toward Europe and more toward the Middle East. Will the most successful military alliance in history implode or recoil in the face of external aggression? If you trust our intelligence agencies, Russia indirectly intervened in our elections. America and China have the capacity to use their own cyber might to disrupt adversaries. It may not be a problem for authoritarian-controlled societies, but we still-free Yanks want to know what business or what government agency is scooping up our emails, online history and consumer preferences. Privacy and national security need to be carefully balanced. How we receive and evaluate information in the age of "false news" is a conundrum. No more editors, fewer newspapers and lots of Internet trolls and hackers with malevolent agendas. And the sticky issues that refuse to go away — like Iran and Afghanistan and Syria. Does America have the right or obligation to intervene in cases of gross human rights violations? Self-interest? And what's the end point? Colin Powell, the secretary of state who coined the Pottery Barn rule — "you break it, you own it" — told us to get in and get out. Overextend in the Middle East and you land smack in the middle of the conflicting interests of friends and foes alike. Since our direct interventions in the region, the agents of religious-based excess and tyrants whose only limitation is a shortage of means to eliminate opposition have savagely dispensed of the Arab Spring. And then there is the only true democracy in the region — Israel — which seems to have given up on negotiation with its unruly neighbors. So. Let's throw in the towel and move to Canada, eh? Often our northern neighbors are taken for granted, but they are a major reason we don't have to worry about our shared border. Increasingly, we ask ourselves how we can be so similar and yet be so different. On the world stage, Canada plays the conciliator and we the protector. Conversely, our neighbor Cuba could not be more radically different. How are we doing after a year of renewed relations? Just outside the NAFTA trade area is Central America, where countries still get pneumonia when America coughs. Since the convulsive wars of the 1980s, we hope against hope that the Americans retiring down there will find sunnier and more stable climes. But will they? And what do we make of phenomena like the Panamanian law firm of Mossack Fonseca, revealed by the massive leak called the Panama Papers to enable tax avoidance and evasion around the world? Is this an anomaly or accepted means of hiding assets from the taxman? Farther away, when we hear about distress and chaos in Gambia or South Sudan or Somalia, it seems as though all of Africa is going up in flames. Is there another, more modern Africa that Western news sources don't care to cover? Closer to home, at our conference we'll ask some folks new to our shores how it feels to be an immigrant. And because our own self-worth seems to be so deeply ingrained in our various identities, we'll talk about politics and different interest groups like LGTBQ, out-of-work coal miners, women and racial and ethnic minorities. There will be educators on hand to talk about how education and ideas flow more freely across national boundaries in the cyber age. Similarly, the art world, once the exclusive bailiwick of booking agents, galleries and museums, has become truly more democratic and multicultural. But is the best of it still the property of the wealthy few? We live, as the ancient (and probably apocryphal) Chinese curse put it, in interesting times. Come to our conference and serve your interest in these times.

Realtor Amy Flowers, of Royal LePage, is a long-time resident of Milton.  (Rene Johnston / Toronto Star) | Order this photo   By Tess KalinowskiReal Estate Reporter Fri., Feb. 10, 2017 There’s a housing supply shortage looming in the Toronto area. That’s the warning the head of the association for new home builders has been issuing every chance he gets in recent months. Even with a “making-it-happen attitude” it will take five to seven years to get the supply of new homes up to a healthy level again, said Bryan Tuckey of the Building and Land Development Association (BILD). The inventory of new homes for sale in the Toronto region has sunk to historic lows, he said. There are various reasons, including lengthy provincial approval times for water and waste water servicing that’s required before a single toilet can be flushed in a new neighbourhood. Read more: Census shows big population gains in Toronto, Milton and Brampton Article Continued Below Soaring Toronto housing sparks interest in co-owning Figures from the Toronto Real Estate Board suggest a similar shortage exists on the resale market. People aren’t listing their homes because they worry about what they’ll be able to afford among the region’s soaring prices. If government and builders don’t figure something out soon, Toronto is heading down the road of cities like London and San Francisco, says Tuckey. “You have the most affluent parts of British society not being able to afford a home in London or in San Francisco where we see jobs being lost because people can’t afford to live in communities where they want to work and play and live,” he said. The census data released Wednesday reinforce his concerns, said Tuckey. It shows Toronto’s population grew 6.2 per cent between 2011 and 2016, above the national average of 5 per cent. But that growth was exceeded by several communities outside the city including Brampton, Caledon, King, Markham and Bradford. For the second consecutive census, Milton has proved to be the GTA town with the biggest boom. It registered 30 per cent population growth in the census period. “We talk a lot about Toronto, and still, about 65 to 70 per cent of the growth is going to be outside Toronto. Plus, it’s family oriented growth, so communities like Oakville, Brampton, Milton, Bradford, West Gwillimbury where growth was intended to happen,” said Tuckey. He’s not surprised that those families want what the industry calls ground-related homes — townhomes, semi-detached and detached houses. Some will happily sacrifice space for affordability. Tuckey calls townhomes the new single-family home even though they don’t usually have big yards for the kids to play. To get that ground-related property, many are moving outside the city to the booming 905-area communities. In Milton, three-storey stacked townhomes and the more traditional two-storey towns with basements are the highest demand category among home buyers, said Royal LePage agent Amy Flowers, whose business is flourishing in the town that now stands at a population of just over 110,000. Those homes run between $500,000 and $600,000 on average for about 1,200 square feet of living space. Toronto buyers in search of the holy grail of GTA housing are typically paying between about $750,000 and $800,000 for that detached house with a yard, said Flowers. “Our buyer demographic is interesting,” she said. “We’re one of the only towns in the country where our median age is actually going down.” In little more than a decade, the influx of families has transformed Milton. The old theatre has closed in favour of a multiplex near the highway. There’s a Wal-Mart. When Flowers moved into town about 15 years ago, it took about 10 minutes to drive across Milton. Now, with traffic, it is double that. When it comes to buying homes, Milton has its share of big-league competition. On Thursday there were only 68 freehold listings and eight condos listed on the TREB’s Multiple Listings Service for Milton. Of those, four of the houses and half the condos were already conditionally sold. Like Toronto, list prices have pretty much lost any bearing on the final sale amount and competitive offers are routine, said Flowers. ▶ Data from the 2016 census shows Canada is the fastest growing country in the G7. Here's a look at some of the census numbers, which show the country's population is up to 35.15 million as of last year.(The Canadian Press ) Buyers, who often experience the disappointment of three or four unsuccessful home bids, need to go in firm on the set offer date, advised Flowers. Home inspections are nice but they’re not always possible, she said. If it all sounds familiar to Toronto’s property scene, Flowers concedes one difference: “We don’t have 30 offers on a house. We’ll have more like five.” But Milton has an edge over Toronto in that buyers don’t have to pay a municipal land transfer tax. As well, the federal government’s new mortgage stress test rules make it necessary for some to stretch their dollar by moving northwest of the city. It can be a long commute for downtown workers, but lots of couples use it as a halfway point between jobs in Mississauga-Brampton and Kitchener-Waterloo, she said. There is an influx of families moving in from Mississauga and Brampton, “looking for a nice safe place to raise their children,” said Milton councillor Colin Best. The growth has brought some benefits, including a new hospital that is expected to open in the fall, he noted. But the supply of homes for newcomers is dire. Best said he’s had realtors compare it the 1990s, before the population tripled. The town approved about 6,000 homes three years ago. They’ve only built 1,000. Of 11 zoning applications, only three developments are being built. Best said a lot of that is due to delays, development charges, appeals and labour turmoil in the building industry. Transportation is emerging as a big problem though. “I have people spending three hours a day commuting from Milton to Toronto,” said Best. While GO has increased the number of Milton trains, he is dismayed that Metrolinx says it will be 2041 before his community gets the all-day, two-way service being rolled out in the coming decade across much of the rest of the Toronto region. “Sixty-three per cent of Halton Region goes outside the region to work. That’s based on a previous census. It’s probably worse now. If you come to the Milton GO train, the parking lot is full by 7:30 a.m. Twenty-five per cent of (those GO riders) are coming from the west,” said Best. Don’t even get him started on the rush hour traffic on Highway 401. The youth of the community has its challenges too, he said. There was a community dispute among older residents and younger families about whether the town should install a splash pad at Dorset Park. “It was quite the divide,” said Best. While the province is rushing to build enough schools for the booming number of students in Milton, children are being bused and moved around in the transition. There are 16 kindergarten classes among four schools and at one point, consideration was being given to the idea of having one school just for kindergarten kids, said Best. “We’ve had clients who have had their kids in six different schools and sometimes the same household will have kids going to different schools,” said Flowers. It’s another reason to buy a resale home even though she acknowledges it’s in her best interest to say so. “If you buy a resale house, that has everything all sorted and figured out. You’ll know what school you’re going to,” she said. Besides, she adds, “If you’re buying new, you’re on a waiting list for a year to two years.” It’s just one more sign of the bifurcation of housing that has been happening in Toronto is also happening in the maturing communities surrounding the city, said Cherise Burda, executive director of the Ryerson City Building Institute. She favours the region’s sweeping transit expansion. But Burda says she wonders too if some of the billions of dollars should perhaps be invested in housing closer to the city. We have a choice, she said: We can build out or we can build up. Building up is costly. Land on the periphery is cheap and municipalities make it cheaper by subsidizing infrastructure to entice the development charges new builds bring to the community. The census just shows that sprawl is continuing and opportunities are being missed, she said. “The fact that those are the economic options for developers and for home buyers shows that we’re missing the types of policies to fix that,” she said. The region needs more of what’s called “the missing middle” — housing that falls somewhere between the highrise and the sprawl option. Before the war, families lived in flats downtown. It wasn’t until after the war that the automobile spurred sprawl. In Paris and Barcelona, mid-rise apartments are the norm for family living. “We’re going to buy the options we’re given,” said Burda. “We’re not building enough infill development, we’re not building enough townhouses and mid-rises — not just in downtown Toronto but also in suburban centres,” she said. “If we look at downtown Toronto, 75 per cent of people walk, cycle or take transit,” said Burda. The region would look very different and our lives would be better if we built homes that put people within easy access of transit and jobs. “There are all these plans for building houses in the periphery,” she said. “We have enough land to keep building ground level housing for decades to come. But is that going to serve a population that doesn’t want to drive to get to work?” Read more about: Brampton, Census Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

Haley Nelson/Post-Gazette The 1788 Pub in the new Whole Foods market that opened in Upper St. Clair last month. By Craig Giammona / Bloomberg News Whole Foods Market Inc., facing its worst sales slump in more than a decade, is taking a step that would have been unthinkable in its high-flying days: shrinking the size of the chain. Though Whole Foods plans to open six stores during the current quarter, including two relocations, the company said Wednesday that it’s shutting down nine. That kind of retrenchment hasn’t happened since the last recession was underway in 2008. The company, which about 440 U.S. stores including three in the Pittsburgh area -—in East Liberty, Wexford and Upper St. Clair — also said it was abandoning its ambitious growth target and no longer plans to reach 1,200 locations as it tries to get expenses under control. Six straight quarters of declining same-store sales -- a closely watched measure -- have forced the organic-food grocer to tighten its belt. Whole Foods also gave a forecast for the current year that offered little hope of a quick recovery. “This is a company that owned the space for a long time, but there’s way too much competition now,” said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones. “They’ve done several things to try and drive sales, and it’s just not working.” The 1788 Pub in the new Whole Foods market that opened in Upper St. Clair last month. (Haley Nelson/Post-Gazette) Same-store sales dropped 2.4 percent last quarter, worse than the 1.7 percent decrease predicted by analysts. The company now expects sales on that basis to decline as much as 2.5 percent this year, compared with an earlier forecast that was closer to break-even. “People were hoping there would be some improvement,” said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s a bit concerning there’s not a reversal happening there.” Whole Foods has struggled to ward off competition from mainstream supermarkets, including Kroger and Wal-Mart Stores, which began offering more organic fare in recent years. And a bout of food deflation has put additional pressure on the entire industry. Some on Wall Street have been pushing Whole Foods to rein in its growth plans, and the store plan was received warmly. The stock gained 2 percent percent to $29.91 at 10:02 a.m. in New York on Thursday. Prior to the drop, it was down 4.7 percent in 2017. Responsibility for the turnaround is now squarely on John Mackey, a co-founder of the company who retook sole leadership last year. He had served as co-chief executive officer with Walter Robb until November. He has an uphill fight ahead. Same-store sales declined 3.2 percent in the current quarter through Feb. 5, a sign its troubles are worsening. The Austin, Texas-based company also said it would no longer be reporting quarter-to-date figures in future reports, meaning investors will have less to go on. Whole Foods’ struggles have fueled speculation that an activist investor could take on the chain, and one of its largest shareholders is said to have to discussed agitating for sweeping changes. For years, Whole Foods offered products that were tough to find elsewhere, and the shares gave investors exposure to the fast-growing market for organic and natural food. But that advantage has eroded in recent years. With sales growth stagnating last year, Whole Foods announced $300 million in cost cuts. But the company is still ramping up spending elsewhere, including on marketing and technology, and that’s expected to offset the cutbacks. It also introduced a new store concept last year aimed at younger, budget-conscious consumers. So far, only three of the locations -- dubbed 365 by Whole Foods Market -- have opened on the West Coast. The company announced on Wednesday that it has signed leases for new 365 stores in Brooklyn, New York, and Oakland, California. The new concept, named after the company’s private-label brand, is seen as a way for Whole Foods to connect with shoppers who perceive the chain’s conventional stores as too pricey. Whole Foods considered turning some of the stores it was closing into 365 locations, but it wasn’t practical, Mackey said. In some cases the company wanted to “thin out” its presence in a particular market, with the hope that it benefits Whole Foods locations nearby. Some of the stores had leases coming up in 2017, and management decided to accelerate the process and close them now. The decision to shutter the nine stores will help boost profits and comparable sales, Mackey said on a conference call. The company is taking a more disciplined approach to growth but still has 80 stores in the pipeline, he said. “We cleaned up the stores we needed to clean up for the time being, and we’re looking forward to moving forward,” Mackey said.

We have you covered. Here are some of the month's notable stories so far, in case you missed it... Thanks for the Memories Crews began the demolition process Monday on Madison Square Mall. It won't be quick, either -- it's scheduled to take up to six months. The main part of the mall closed last year, and Sears and JC Penney vacated within the last week. The once-crowded property is expected to draw large crowds again when the MidCity Huntsville development officially opens. That could be by the end of this year. Here's a live look at the demolition as it began... Taking Action, Getting Results A Lawrence County woman wrote to us asking for help with a home remodeling project.  She hired a contractor who started the job but left her living in the middle of a construction zone.  Kimberly Clemons is legally blind and feared the contractor had walked away from the job. The first time we saw Mrs. Clemons' house, there was wiring hanging out of the walls, open holes in the floors, lumber stacked in one room, and unfinished flooring in the rest of the house.  This posed a serious hazard for Clemons, who gets around based on her memory of where everything is. The kitchen consisted of a toaster oven, hot plate and small microwave sitting on a folding table. Her kitchen appliances were in the yard. She says her central heating system quit working because of all of the construction dust. Mrs. Clemons and her husband, Robert, restored their old double wide once. It's where they lived together for more than 20 years. "He was a good man," Kimberly said.  "I never had no trouble. He gave me anything I wanted. He would turn over in his grave right now if he knew what was going on. It's so sad." "We'll see if we can get it fixed. Alright?" Al Whitaker said. "Alright," Kimberly replied. Here's what happened when Al Whitaker called the contractor in question... Please enable Javascript to watch this video The "Sock Capital" Once More? Walmart has announced plans to begin purchasing supplies from Renfro Corporation, a local company based in Fort Payne. Walmart says it will begin to source materials from American-based companies like Renfro Corporation in an effort to invest in U.S. manufacturing. Renfro Corporation meanwhile, believes the investments will create around 442 jobs in textile manufacturing, namely by providing Walmart with athletic socks. Could this be the start of something great for the former "sock capital" of the world? A Rare Inside View Our sister station WGNO in New Orleans, posted this dramatic 360 video showing the aftermath of the storms there this week. Definitely a reminder for all of us to stay weather aware.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Struggling retailer Sears Holdings Corp. reported a 10.3 percent drop in comparable store sales for the holiday quarter, and said it would cut debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion this year. Shares of the company (SHLD), which has been struggling with years of losses and falling sales, were up 39 percent at $7.70 in premarket trading on Friday. The company - controlled by its billionaire chief executive, Edward Lampert - announced a new plan to cut costs by at least $1 billion in 2017 by reducing overhead, improving merchandise at its stores and through better inventory management. Once the largest U.S. retailer, Sears has lost its standing as customers move to online shopping or rivals such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. To cope with the slump, Sears has cut costs, spun off some of its stores into a real estate investment trust, raised debt from Lampert's hedge fund and put some brands on sale. The company has, however, failed to turn a profit in more than a year and said in December there was no guarantee when it would return to profitability. Sears said on Friday it sold five Sears full-line stores and two Sears Auto Centers for $72.5 million in January and engaged Eastdil Secured to raise at least $1 billion from the sale of its real estate. The retailer said last month it sold its lawn and garden equipment brand, Craftsman, to Stanley Black & Decker Inc. Sears said it would use proceeds from these sales, improving profitability and working capital management to reduce its debt and pension obligations by $1.5 billion in fiscal 2017. The company had pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities of $2 billion as of Oct. 29. Sears also estimated revenue of $6.1 billion and a loss of $535-$635 million in the fourth quarter ended January. © 2017 Thomson/Reuters. All rights reserved.

City Attorney Trey Smith said the suit was filed in Pope County Circuit Court by Landers Holding LLC. They are represented by attorney Stephen R. Giles, who also represented Wal-Mart when the Neighborhood Market referendum was approved by voters. Smith said the developers are asking for an injunction from setting, ordering or conducting a special election, scheduled for May 9. Not only does Landers LLC want the referendum set aside, they are also asking that the act passed in 2015 by the Arkansas General Assembly to be declared unconstitutional and invalid. The act increased the time petitioners had to gather signatures for a referendum from 30 to 60 days. According to Giles, the court should rule that the city's 1998 ordinance, which stated petitioners have 30 days to file their required number of signatures, should be upheld. In that case, Marina Road residents did not submit their signatures in time. Smith said that state law supersedes local law, and the Marina Road residents had 60 days and submitted 1,347 signatures to City Clerk Kathy Collins in time. She certified 960, two more than the 958 needed, to go on with the election. Giles filed the complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief against Russellville Mayor Randy Horton, City Clerk Kathy Collins, members of the City Council in their official capacity as elected officials and the Pope County Election Commission in their official capacity, Smith said. The city has 30 days to file an answer. Giles said the developers asked for an expedited hearing. The complaint was filed in the court of Circuit Judge Dennis Sutterfield. The Election Commission previously set the deadline to register to vote for the referendum for April 10. Early voting will begin May 2 and be conducted at the Election Commission headquarters at 1509 E. Main St., Suite 7 from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Tuesday through Friday and the Monday before the election on Tuesday, May 9. Hours on election day will be from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. at the Election Commission headquarters. The ballot for the special election will ask voters to repeal Ordinance 2260 or vote against the repeal of 2260. If a majority of the voters vote for the repeal of the ordinance, that will repeal the ordinance and not allow the rezoning of the property from R-1 to PUD. If a majority votes against the repeal of the ordinance, that will affirm the ordinance and allow the rezoning and the project could continue. Ordinance 2260 rezoned property on Marina Road to planned unit development (PUD) from residential and was approved by the Planning Commission and City Council. The rezoning was requested by Landers Holding LLC, who want to build The Arbors of Russellville, a 75-bed resort-style facility on a 20-acre lot and a 16-room memory care unit and independent garden homes.

Someone called 911 about seeing two vehicles in the parking lot with two white males standing in front of them smoking, said Police Capt. Shelia Lingle. A police officer checked the license plate on one of the vehicles and the name registered to it was Trent Earnhardt. The officer noted Earnhardt had been banned from the store. The officer stopped the men just before they went inside and searched them. Earnhardt, 21, of the 600 block of Playground Lane, was charged with misdemeanor carry concealed weapons, felony possession of heroin, misdemeanor possession of schedule III controlled substance (buprenorphrine hydrochloride, a drug used to treat opioid addiction), misdemeanor possession of a controlled schedule IV (alprazolam or Xanax), misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia and misdemeanor second-degree trespassing. Lingle said Earnhardt had a pill container that had pills inside, a lighter, two syringes, a metal spoon, and metallic knuckles. Police said a hard brown substance believed to be heroin was found in a plastic bag. She said Earnhardt told officials the heroin was marijuana, but officers didn’t believe him. Earnhardt has since been released from the Rowan County Detention Center after posting a $3,000 secured bond.

Puppy dogs. The smell of freshly-baked bread. Money in the bank, and six-pack abs. Dave SimpsonFormer Pekin Times Publisher TURNABOUT: A mere year ago, it was nothing but wine and roses. Puppy dogs. The smell of freshly-baked bread. Money in the bank, and six-pack abs. Perfection. Total vindication. Proof positive of unquestioned galactic superiority. Confetti descending from the rafters. The football team I root for every year was the undisputed champion. Best in the world, the solar system, and our neck of the Milky Way. Top of the heap. That day, there was nothing in the history of mankind better than being a fan of the football team for which I root. That was then. This, sadly, is now. There is a new best and undisputed champion of the solar system, as of Sunday. The wine and roses, puppy dogs, the freshly-baked bread, and the six-pack abs now reside in New England. Some folks can't even remember last year's greatest team in the history of mankind. Our big day is discarded, forgotten, and perfection in every way is a mere memory. Enjoy your moment in the sun, Patriot fans. Because – take it from a Bronco fan - even after proving your total galactic superiority, the garbage still has to go out when the chicken wrapper starts to smell bad, old joints still ache in the morning, and tax time is almost upon us. Even for the fans of world champions. Your team winning the Super Bowl is kind of like scoring the closest-in parking space at Walmart. It's nice, maybe even worth mentioning at dinner, but it's a fleeting victory. They do this Super Bowl deal every year, and chances are the confetti will be falling on some other best team in the history of the universe in a mere 12 months. THIS IS CRAZY: I catch myself trying to score the closest-in parking space every day when I go to exercise, and I'm curiously happy when the space closest to the door is available. I pay good money to trot on a treadmill for a half hour, then ride on an exercise bike for an hour, sweating copiously in the name of fitness and good health. But, subconsciously, I can't stand the thought of walking an extra 25 yards across the parking lot. Go figure. I MISS IDOL: I don't know about you, but I miss “American Idol.” Every year at this time, a couple evenings a week, The Wife and I would sit down in front of the TV and watch “American Idol.” She was a fan from the beginning, but I was a late adopter. I couldn't carry a tune in a bucket, so I don't think it was necessarily the singing that attracted me. No, it was the incredible enthusiasm of those thousands of young people, risking probable defeat and sometimes humiliation, to make a dream come true. In a world full of young people all too often hardened by skepticism, cynicism, and even anger at perceived promises not fulfilled, it was wonderful to see youngsters so head-over-heels excited to pursue a nearly-impossible dream. Cold February nights aren't the same without “Idol.” SAY AGAIN?: A relative used the term “husband ears” recently when telling The Wife about her husband perhaps not hanging with eager anticipation upon her every word. This reminded me of the old guy at exercise who sometimes wears a t-shirt that says, “My wife says I don't pay attention to her. Or something like that...” The challenge of hanging with eager anticipation upon a spouse's every word can be difficult after, in our case, over 30 years. We've both heard each others' favorite stories hundreds of times. (My favorite: The property taxes on my land in the mountains came to $7.28 a year before I built my cabin. The punch line: “And they let me pay it in two installments!”) I love that story, but if The Wife is around, I can't tell it, because I can see her lips moving, and her eyes rolling, when I get to the punch line. What with ears that don't hear like they used to, and loved ones who sometimes mumble, and the proclivity to retell golden oldie stories, I think it's overly simplistic to chalk this phenomenon up solely to “Spouse Ears.” About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Contact Us Western Illinois Family Magazine Online Forms Archives Submit News Weather Coupons Market Place Regional Classifieds Illinois Auctions Classifieds Place An Ad Cars Boats Magazine Schools Info Canton Schools Cuba Schools Lewistown Schools Spoon River Valley Schools Schools Info Public Notice Illinois Farmington Schools VIT Schools Astoria Schools Avon Schools Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.

McDonald's just introduced a new snow crab salad sandwich at four San Francisco Bay Area locations. The new dish features crab meat mixed with celery and seasoned mayo on romaine lettuce and tomato, on a sourdough bun. On the East Coast, McDonald's offers a seasonal lobster salad sandwich.

Pizza Hut U.K. is betting on it. The company has just launched two new pizzas with craft beer-infused pizza dough. There are two flavors-- Steak Feast– topped with a three-cheese blend, shaved steak, mushrooms, caramelised onions and a spring onion garnish served on a beer BBQ sauce; and the vegetarian American Hot topped with three-cheeses, sweetcorn, mushrooms, caramelised onions, jalapenos and a spring onion garnish served on a beer BBQ sauce.

The chef uses a full bottle of premium tequila that goes for $200 in every dozen donuts.

The seasonal Kisses are a creamy orange color and taste, well, like carrot cake.  Hershey says just as the taste of Valentine's Day are red velvet cake, so should carrot cake be the taste of Easter.  Not so, say purists, who reject the idea that Americans to associate Carrot Cake Kisses with spring the way pumpkin spice lattes have become associated with fall.  carrot-cake-hershey’s-kiss- Break me off a piece of that 24 karat gold Kit Kat bar. Nestle Japan has released a special edition gilded Kit Kat bar. The single finger bars are wrapped in 24 karat gold foil—which, in its purest form, is actually edible. Only 500 bars will be manufactured and sold in Japan's luxury department stores for 2,016 yen—about $16.

KFC China unveils pink chicken burger After the black burger craze, it looks like fast food companies may taking a lighter approach. KFC China just unveiled a duo of chicken sandwiches: a black diamond bacon spicy chicken leg burger and a rose cheese roasted chicken leg burger. We're not sure what a rose-flavored burger tastes like-- and neither are some of the confused tasters in China. The chicken chain is reportedly experimenting with new items after facing declining sales in the country.  (KFC China) kfc-china-unveils-pink-chicken-burger The Chizza from KFC Philippines Move over Napoli Crispy Pizza Chicken from KFC Hong Kong. The Chizza from KFC Philippines has taken the world by storm. This chicken-pizza mashup is meant to be eaten more like a personal pan pizza and features a large, flattened chicken breast topped with traditional pizza ingredients like cheese, pepperoni, peppers, pineapple and more.

But sadly unlike other countries such as in the U.K., Canada and Australia, the U.S. has been deprived of Pizza Hut’s hot dog stuffed crust since 2012. But all that will likely change June 18. The Impulsive Buy spotted a promotional flyer that all but confirmed a hot dog stuffed crust pizza would be arriving stateside later this month. Either that, or it’s a pizza topped with ketchup and mustard. (Pizza Hut UK) pizza-hut’s-hot-dog-stuffed-coming-soon? Meat Pie Stuffed Crust Pizza Is it a pizza or a pie? Now true meatlovers don't have to decide with Pizza Hut Australia's latest extreme release: the Four’N Twenty-stuffed pie crust. Four'N Twenty is a popular meat pie restaurant down under so the new pizza-pie is a true fast food collaboration. The pizza itself can be topped with any of your favorite toppings-- pepperoni, olives, mushrooms, sausage, etc. Then each slice contains a flaky meat pie stuffed with gravy and mincemeat baked into the crust with a traditional tomato sauce “squeezie," which looks like a dollop of ketchup to us.  (Pizza Hut Australia) meat-pie-stuffed-crust-pizza Lobster-Donut Roll from Kane's Some food mashups are extreme but we still imagine they taste pretty good. Lobster salad and donuts don’t really fit into that category. But for Massachusetts based bakery Kane’s Handcrafted Donuts, the combo is now available. The Lobster Dowich—traditional lobster salad served on a brioche-based donut instead of bread-- is the latest twist on a classic New England seafood roll. The Dowich is also available with braised beef or chicken—but lobster is the go-to Boston-area favorite. According to Forbes, it actually tastes pretty good.

Now you can chow down on the entire summer cookout in one beastly bite. Carl's Jr and Hardees are debuting The Most American Thickburger-- a beef patty topped with a split hot dog. The meaty duo sits on a layer of kettle cooked Lay's potato chips-- to prevent them from getting soggy-- between hamburger buns loaded with ketchup, mustard, tomato, red onion, pickles and American cheese. The burger will have 1,030 calories and 64 grams of fat.

Pretty. darn. good.   oh-bite-it- Carl's Jr. Pepperoni Pizza Fries Never again will famished snackers have to decide between pizza or french fries. Carl's Jr. says why not have both? The latest mash-up to hit fast counters is a creation the chain is calling "Pepperoni Pizza Fries." And yes, they are very real. Right now they're only being tested at a dozen locations in Southern California but the recipe seems simple enough to recreate at home. French fries are topped with marinara sauce, melted mozzarella cheese and a few slices of pepperoni pizza. These souped cheesy fries retail for $2.39.  (Carl's Jr.) carl's-jr.-pepperoni-pizza-fries Is this an edible bar of gold? This 24 Carrot-- not karats, sadly-- is the work of YouTuber Instructables.

See Offers Business Posted February 9 Updated February 9 increase font size Whole Foods struggles, victim of its own success Analysis: Organic foods have become so mainstream that organic chains now face competition from conventional big-box stores. The Washington Post Share Comment Read Article Organic food has never been so popular among American consumers. Ironically, that’s bad news for the brand that made organic a household name – namely, the Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods. On Wednesday, Whole Foods reported what is arguably its worst performance in a decade, announcing its sixth consecutive quarter of falling same-store sales and cutting its outlook for the year. The company is closing nine stores, the most it has ever closed at one time. A mere 16 months ago, Whole Foods predicted it would grow its 470 U.S. locations to more than 1,200. Whole Foods this week reported its worst performance in a decade, announcing its sixth consecutive quarter of falling same-store sales. The company is closing nine stores, the most it has ever closed at one time. Associated Press/Lynne Sladky, File Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → In Maine, a Whole Foods store is located at 2 Somerset St. in Portland. The problem is one that chief executive John Mackey probably didn’t predict when he first opened Whole Foods as a neighborhood natural foods store 36 years ago: Organics, then a fringe interest, have become so thoroughly mainstream that organic chains now have to face conventional big-box competitors. Mass-market retailers were responsible for 53.3 percent of organic food sales in 2015, according to the Organic Trade Association; natural retailers clocked in just north of 37. And Whole Foods is hardly the only store feeling the squeeze: Sprouts and Fresh Market, the second- and third-largest publicly traded organic stores, have also seen falling stock prices. “Whole Foods created this space and had it all to themselves for years,” said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones. “But in the past five years, a lot of people started piling in. And now there’s a lot of competition.” In many ways, the story of Whole Food’s decline is also the story of how the organic movement took over America. Between 2005 and 2015, sales of organic food increased 209 percent, according to the Organic Trade Association. Last year, organic sales topped $43.3 billion. The driving force behind this growth, most analysts agree, is none other than millennials: Consumers ages 18 to 34 are the largest buyers of organics, and they’re the most likely to consider themselves “knowledgeable” about their food. As they came of age, mainstream grocery chains have been forced to adapt, too. Wal-Mart ramped up its organics selection in 2006. Kroger introduced its Simple Truth brand in 2012 – the store’s CEO Mike Ellis later said it was the store’s “most successful brand launch ever.” Earlier this week, Aldi announced plans for a $1.6-billion U.S. expansion, with much of that growth aimed at offering “a wider range of organic and gluten-free products.” By volume, the largest organic retailer in the U.S. is currently believed to be Costco – which in 2015 sold $4 billion of organic produce and packaged foods. Like Wal-Mart, Kroger and Aldi, Costco sells organic produce for considerably cheaper than do natural food stores, farmers markets or Whole Foods. In fact, lowering prices has been one of Whole Food’s primary strategies for dealing with competitors. Apart from shuttering stores and stalling expansion plans, the company is continuing to focus on “365 by Whole Foods,” a two-year-old division aimed at launching stores for “value-conscious” consumers. It’s also been dropping prices at its regular locations and mailing out national discount circulars, something it had not previously done. Speaking to investors Wednesday, Mackey indicated that he did not want to see “too big of a gap” between the prices at Whole Foods and those at stores like Costco and Kroger. But some organic advocates are concerned that lowering the prices of organic foods – an apparent prerequisite for mainstream popularity – can happen only at the expense of the movement’s early principles. This fear is not entirely new: Michael Pollan fretted about it in the pages of The New York Times when Wal-Mart began selling organic Rice Krispie treats 11 years ago. But with results like Whole Foods, it is becoming more urgent, said Ronnie Cummins, the co-founder of the Organic Consumers Association. Cummins points out that some of the most successful, most mainstream organic products don’t meet his organization’s strict definition of what organic should be. Those include the ubiquitous Earthbound Farms, which grows its lettuces in monocultures, and Aurora Organic Dairy, which has been criticized for running its operation like an industrial factory farm. “If you’re a publicly traded corporation, you have no choice but to maximize short-term profits,” Cummins said. “But we are going to be complaining to Whole Foods if they decrease their quality to keep up with the competition.” That approach may be most profitable now, he acknowledges – but Whole Foods needs to think long-term. After all, when the company was founded, there was barely even a market for organic foods. Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. Organic food has never been so popular among American consumers. Ironically, that's bad news for the brand that made organic a household name — namely, the Austin-based Whole Foods. On Wednesday, Whole Foods reported what is arguably its worst performance in a decade, announcing its sixth consecutive quarter of falling same-store sales and cutting its outlook for the year. The company is closing nine stores, the most it has ever closed at one time. A mere 16 months ago, Whole Foods predicted it would grow its 470 U.S. locations to more than 1,200. The problem is one that chief executive John Mackey probably didn't predict when he first opened Whole Foods as a neighborhood natural foods store 36 years ago: Organics, then a fringe interest, have become so thoroughly mainstream that organic chains now have to face conventional big-box competitors. Mass-market retailers were responsible for 53.3 percent of organic food sales in 2015, according to the Organic Trade Association; natural retailers clocked in just north of 37. And Whole Foods is hardly the only store feeling the squeeze: Sprouts and Fresh Market, the second- and third-largest publicly traded organic stores, have also seen falling stock prices. “Whole Foods created this space and had it all to themselves for years,” said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones. “But in the past five years, a lot of people started piling in. And now there's a lot of competition.” In many ways, the story of Whole Food's decline is also the story of how the organic movement took over the United States. Between 2005 and 2015, sales of organic food increased 209 percent, according to the Organic Trade Association. Last year, organic sales topped $43.3 billion. The driving force behind this growth, most analysts agree, is none other than millennials: Consumers aged 18 to 34 are the largest buyers of organics, and they're the most likely to consider themselves “knowledgeable” about their food. As they came of age, mainstream grocery chains have been forced to adapt, too. Wal-Mart ramped up its organics selection in 2006. Kroger introduced its Simple Truth brand in 2012 — the store's chief executive, Mike Ellis, later said it was the store's “most successful brand launch ever.” This week, Aldi announced plans for a $1.6 billion U.S. expansion, with much of that growth aimed at offering “a wider range of organic and gluten-free products.” By volume, the largest organic retailer in the United States is believed to be Costco, which in 2015 sold $4 billion of organic produce and packaged foods. Like Wal-Mart, Kroger and Aldi, Costco sells organic produce for considerably less than do natural food stores, farmers markets or Whole Foods. In fact, lowering prices has been one of Whole Food's primary strategies for dealing with competitors. Apart from shuttering stores and stalling expansion plans, the company is continuing to focus on “365 by Whole Foods,” a two-year-old division aimed at launching stores for “value-conscious” consumers. It's also been dropping prices at its regular locations and mailing out national discount circulars, something it had not previously done. Speaking to investors Wednesday, Mackey indicated that he did not want to see “too big of a gap” between the prices at Whole Foods and those at stores like Costco and Kroger. But some organic advocates are concerned that lowering the prices of organic foods — an apparent prerequisite for mainstream popularity — can only happen at the expense of the movement's early principles. This fear is not entirely new: Michael Pollan fretted about it in the pages of the New York Times when Wal-Mart began selling organic Rice Krispie treats 11 years ago. But with results like Whole Foods, it is becoming more urgent, said Ronnie Cummins, the co-founder of the Organic Consumers Association. Cummins pointed out that some of the most successful, most mainstream organic products don't meet his organization's strict definition of what organic should be. Those include the ubiquitous Earthbound Farms, which grows its lettuces in monocultures, and Aurora Organic Dairy, which has been criticized for running its operation like an industrial factory farm. If you're a publicly traded corporation, you have no choice but to maximize short-term profits,” Cummins said. “But we are going to be complaining to Whole Foods if they decrease their quality to keep up with the competition.” More Business Stock indexes extend climb into record heights Big Sears cuts announced; shares soar Make less than $54K?

Police say the robbery happened around 3:07 p.m. on Feb. 1. The 83-year-old Hiram resident was shopping when an unknown woman approached her and started asking questions about grocery items. The victim felt uncomfortable with the questioning and with how close the suspect got to her, so she walked away. The woman noticed when she went to check out that her wallet was missing, so she paid in cash. When she got home, she learned that her credit card had already been used at the Walmart in Macedonia, with two other attempts to use it made a the Streetsboro Walmart. The crime is very similar to an incident at the North Olmsted Walmart in December. A 96-year-old woman said that a woman approached her and started asking questions about oranges. Surveillance video showed the suspect reaching into her purse and taking her wallet during the confrontation. No arrests have been made.

Shares of the company, which has been struggling with years of losses and falling sales, were up 39 percent at $7.70 in premarket trading on Friday. The company — controlled by its billionaire chief executive, Edward Lampert — announced a new plan to cut costs by at least $1 billion in 2017 by reducing overhead, improving merchandise at its stores and through better inventory management. Once the largest U.S. retailer, Sears has lost its standing as customers move to online shopping or rivals such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. To cope with the slump, Sears has cut costs, spun off some of its stores into a real estate investment trust, raised debt from Lampert's hedge fund and put some brands on sale. The company has, however, failed to turn a profit in more than a year and said in December there was no guarantee when it would return to profitability. Sears said on Friday it sold five Sears full-line stores and two Sears Auto Centers for $72.5 million in January and engaged Eastdil Secured to raise at least $1 billion from the sale of its real estate.

Sears said the proceeds from these sales would be used to reduce its debt and pension obligations by $1.5 billion for fiscal 2017. The company had pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities of $2 billion as of Oct. 29. Sears also said it expected revenue of $6.1 billion and a loss of $535 million to $635 million in the fourth quarter ended January. In less than two months, Sears shares have plunged 40 percent to their lowest since merging with Kmart in 2004 on fears of bankruptcy ﻿Sears shares 5-day performance —CNBC contributed to this report To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

The BRZ is battling the notion that there’s nowhere to park in Kensington. By: Brodie Thomas Metro Published on For Calgarians the word “Kensington” might evoke images of historic buildings, hip shops – and streets lined bumper to bumper with parked cars. It’s that last image that the area’s Business Revitalization Zone (BRZ) is working to combat. Annie MacInnis, executive director of the Kensington BRZ, said they’ve worked to creatively free up and create new parking spots all around the shopping district in recent months. “If people go to Costco or Walmart, they walk a gazillion miles across a gigantic parking lot to a giant store where they walk a million more miles,” said MacInnis. “But if they come to Kensington they want to park in front of one business and get their one thing and leave.” She said while there might not be a spot directly in front of the store a shopper wants, there are plenty of spots – 684 between on-street and parking lot stalls. Sixty-eight of the newest parking spots created last fall are heated, underground stalls in mixed-use buildings. MacInnis said in one case, the BRZ had a chance to work with the CPA to create spots in the Lido building. Jennifer Friesen / For Metro Mike Derbyshire, general manager of the Calgary Parking Authority, said it was a great way to incorporate parking into the neighbourhood. “That was the first time we ever did a joint venture with a developer, so that was a big opportunity for us,” he said. There are also 34 spots in the St. John’s building. MacInnis said they’ve explored other options to maximize parking, such as changing parallel spots to angle parking where space allowed. They worked with the city to do an audit on “no parking” spots over the summer. “We had a few spots that said “no parking” for no apparent reason,” she said. She encouraged would-be shoppers to check out the BRZ’s online map and to have a backup plan in case their first choice for parking is full.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 February 2017 by Military News Gildan: Supporting Women with Life Skills SOURCE: Gildan Activewear DESCRIPTION: Gildan’s founders began manufacturing apparel more than 30 years ago in Canada, with a fundamental belief that owning its factories was the only way to ensure that products were better quality and always manufactured in the most responsible way. They also believed that true innovation and long term success would come from believing in its people, for it would be in their excellence and commitment that great things could be found. Believing and investing in its people lies at the heart of Gildan’s programs to support its employees in different aspects of their professional, family and personal lives. These programs are driven by the Company’s belief in the potential to improve the quality of life for employees, at work and at home. Gildan first implemented the Women’s Empowerment Program two years ago in collaboration with the Walmart Foundation and World Vision® Honduras. The program supports women by helping them develop the skills they need to become more active decision-makers and leaders in their jobs and their families. Employees at Gildan’s Villanueva sewing facility undertook the advanced workshop in 2016 and the facility was awarded a special recognition from World Vision® for its successful completion of the program. The Company’s San Miguel and San Antonio sewing facilities have also implemented the program, and are working towards graduating their first participants. The Women’s Empowerment Program is unique in that it helps employees recognize their capabilities and equips them with the tools to balance their demands both at work and at home. More than 1,000 Gildan employees in Honduras, both men and women, have participated in this training to date. A graduate of the program, Tania Viera, Sewing Operator, believes that the program helped her learn the value of communications in all of her relationships. “After attending this program, I have improved my relationships with my coworkers as well as my family,” said Tania. “I learned a great lesson from each step of this process, learning to communicate better, be more assertive and more sociable. I also learned to value myself as a person, as a woman and as a mother.”   The program offers over 70 hours of training as well as the opportunity to learn about subjects such as management, finance, communications and health. At the end of the program, a group of women graduates who demonstrate strong leadership potential are selected to be trainers for the next round of candidates. The cycle then repeats itself to sustain the program in each facility. A complimentary feature of the program is that men also play a role in the basic training by learning to recognize some of the challenges women face and ways to help support them. One participant Elmer Antonio Rodriguez, Production Supervisor, believes that the program has important benefits for everyone. “Ever since our first training, my colleagues and I started meeting in groups during our breaks to discuss improvements in our respective teams,” said Elmer Antonio. “We talk about the things we like and dislike about the way the team works. We discuss all the alternatives possible for improving production, quality and maintenance. I’m very grateful for the opportunity to receive this training.” Gildan is committed to implementing the Women’s Empowerment Program within its facilities in Latin American and in doing so, supports the leadership development of its employees that can be applied in all aspects of their lives.

But after a couple of years getting hands on in that industry, she realised she needed to do something different. "It didn't feel like a good fit," says the now managing director of Kellogg Australia and New Zealand. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Managing director of Kellogg Australia and New Zealand, Belinda Tumbers, has been with the company for 19 years. Photo: Gavin Jowitt Instead, Tumbers turned to advertising, where the Kellogg's account was part of her remit in a below-the-line ad agency. She eventually left that role, but was head hunted by Kellogg a couple of years later to join its in-house marketing team. That was 1998, and she's still there, a decision she puts down in large part to her colleagues. "It's a very family-based organisation, and there are great people I've worked with over those years. [Plus] I have complementary values to the company, so it's a good fit," she says. After an initial stint in the Kellogg's marketing team, the journey to the managing director role saw Tumbers spend most of her time (15 years) in sales. She worked her way up to the role of national sales manager at Kellogg Australia, then moved to the US to work on its Wal-Mart International business. Advertisement Next, came a role in New Zealand, where Tumbers ran Kellogg's New Zealand arm for three years, before finally moving back to Australia as sales director, her last role before landing the top job. "It's given me a good basis to step into this role: I know a lot about the customer and retail landscapes; I know how the company operates; and I knew the people I was working alongside, which meant I knew at the outset who I wanted to be a part of my team and who I didn't," she says. Since Tumbers has been at the helm, she's taken swift steps to improve diversity and help the business become more transparent. The former has been achieved in part via the Women of Kellogg program, while the latter has involved an online forum called "Open for Breakfast", where members of the public can ask the company's experts anything (all answers are made public). It's just part of Tumbers' focus to reset the overall company culture. "We're trying to move from more of a conservative, hundred-year-old company to more of an entrepreneurial mindset," she says. CURRICULUM VITAE Name: Belinda Tumbers. Current position: Managing director, Kellogg Australia/New Zealand. Responsibilities: Overseeing a cereal and snacks manufacturing business that operates in Australia and New Zealand which produces, markets and sells brands such as Nutri-Grain, Special K, Sultana Bran, Pringles, Corn Flakes and Coco Pops. Education: Advanced diploma in hospitality management, Macleay College. Additional training/courses: Executive certificate in global management, Thunderbird School of Global Management; executive enterprise leadership development, Harvard Business School; Unilever INSEAD Women in Leadership Development program, Singapore. Professional associations: Board director, Australian Food and Grocery Council (AFGC); elected chairwoman, Trading Partner Forum; member, Australian Institute of Company Directors; member, CEO Institute. Honourable mentions: Finalist, Joe Berry Young Food Executive of the Year Award, 2004. Strength: I thrive in challenging situations and I have a very strong bias for action and delivering results. When things are challenging that's when I tend to be at my best. Weakness: I can be impatient, and in my drive for perfection I sometimes don't always get people on the same page. I need to bring people on that journey from the outset. Management style and tips: Very open, transparent and decisive. I believe if you surround yourself with the best people you will create the right culture and the results will follow. Work motto: If it doesn't challenge you, it doesn't change you.

Start off with his trademark issue — one that clearly helped him win the 64 crucial electoral votes of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin: trade. Twenty years ago, Bill Clinton’s administration was busy negotiating with China for normal trade relations. China’s economy was growing rapidly. Its manufactures were inexpensive. And American firms looked with relish on a market of 1 billion customers with fast-growing incomes. Clinton’s approach, supported by leading Republicans, was based on a lesson that every college student learns in Economics 101, whether taught by a Keynesian or a Milton Friedman fan. Free trade benefits both sides, with lower prices and increased economic growth. Clinton hustled to push “permanent normal trade relations” with China through Congress in the election year of 2000. There was broad support in the Senate, and the House passed an amendment establishing a commission to monitor China’s human rights practices. It passed by a 237-197 margin, with 164 Republicans and 73 Democrats voting yes. Freer trade with China has benefited Americans in many ways. Your smartphone would cost a lot more without those components manufactured in China. The Department of Agriculture reports that it’s cheaper, in real dollars, to buy clothing and toys for children than it was in the 1970s. Members of the elite who doubt this should visit a Wal-Mart or one of its competitors. But there have been downsides, too. China’s huge and rapid economic surge is a phenomenon never seen before in history and likely never to be seen again. It would be surprising if its impact were not immediately apparent or entirely beneficial. A 2011 study co-conducted by MIT economist David Autor found, in the words of The Wall Street Journal, that in the United States, “regions most exposed to China tended not only to lose more manufacturing jobs, but also to see overall employment decline. Areas with higher exposure also had larger increases in workers receiving unemployment insurance, food stamps and disability payments.” These effects may have been exacerbated by Obama-era legislation and regulations, which slowed growth generally. Autor and his colleagues noted last year that in areas most affected, adjustment has been slow, “with wages and labor-force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated.” And “offsetting employment gains in other industries have yet to materialize.” Someone at 725 Fifth Ave. noticed, and the effects are also apparent to reporters who bother to travel to counties where Trump ran well in the election. We’re seeing men who are permanently without jobs and living off disability payments, rising death rates among middle-aged whites, and widespread opioid addiction. That has prompted at least one reporter who is no Trump fan, Time’s Joe Klein, to ask: “Is the self-esteem inherent in manufacturing jobs long considered obsolete — think of those grand old steel mills — more important than the lower prices that the global market provides? Have we tilted too far toward market efficiency and too far away from social cohesion?” In addressing those questions, it’s helpful to look back on one of the policy successes of the 1990s: welfare reform. Pioneered mainly by Republicans but also by some Democrats, pushed through Congress three times by Republicans and, after two vetoes, signed by Clinton in 1996, it limited welfare grants and required — and helped — welfare mothers to get jobs. Most research has shown positive results. Former welfare recipients reported a sense of pride and accomplishment, and many advanced up the economic ladder. They felt they set a good example for their children, and it’s probably no coincidence that their children committed many fewer crimes than their counterparts a generation before. Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute (where I’m a resident fellow), has argued that the best ingredient for happiness and contentment is a sense of “earned success.” It can be earned by raising a family, helping neighbors, contributing to charity and — critical here — working at a job. Welfare reform enabled many women to get a sense of earned success by working at a job. Globalized free trade, though having many good effects, seems to have prevented many men from getting a sense of earned success by depriving them of jobs. All of this suggests that the gross domestic product is not the only metric to evaluate President Trump’s trade policies and that the answers to Joe Klein’s questions aren’t so clear as they have seemed to those of us who took Economics 101.

About 700 of these men are confined to vessels in Honolulu, some making less than $1 an hour to catch premium tuna and swordfish sold at some of America's most upscale restaurants and grocery stores. In this unique fishing arrangement, Hawaii's boat owners pay brokers up to $10,000 for each crew member sent from abroad. Because the workers don't have visas, they aren't allowed to arrive at Honolulu's airport. Instead, they're flown to foreign ports and put on fishing boats for long sails back to Hawaii. In this Thursday, Feb. 2, 2017, photo, a man stands on a commercial fishing boat docked at Pier 38 in Honolulu. Hawaii authorities may have been violating their own state laws for years by issuing commercial fishing licenses to thousands of foreign workers who have been refused entry into the United States, The Associated Press has found. About 700 of these men are currently confined to vessels in Honolulu without visas, some making less than $1 an hour. (AP Photo/Caleb Jones) Before they start working, they need a commercial fishing license. And in order to get that, Hawaii requires that they are "lawfully admitted" to the U.S. As proof of legal admission, state officials point to landing permits issued to all fishermen by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents when the men arrive at the dock. Here's the hitch: AP has learned Customs agents stamp "refused" on all the landing permits, which voids them. So instead of being "lawfully admitted," the fishermen are actually barred by law from setting foot in the U.S. "Try taking a check to your bank that says 'void' on it and telling them, 'Oh, but they wrote the check to me,'" said Hawaii attorney Lance Collins, who advocates for the workers. Nonetheless, in a written opinion, Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said the Department of Land and Natural Resources provides the landing permits as proof the fishermen are "lawfully admitted." Customs sees it differently. "NO. They cannot be admitted," spokesman Frank Falcon wrote in an email. The Hawaii Longline Association has condemned labor abuses. Its president Sean Martin would not comment for this story, but in the past the group said the crew members are legally hired for legitimate work on the fleet's 141 active vessels. And while the conditions and pay are often below U.S. standards, the jobs are typically better than the bleak opportunities the men have at home, mostly in the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia and the tiny Pacific island of Kiribati. Under federal law, U.S. citizens must make up 75 percent of the crew on most American commercial fishing boats. An AP investigation last year revealed Hawaii's fleet — which catches about $110 million worth of seafood annually — relies on a federal loophole allowing foreign fishermen to fill most jobs. On some boats, the men are exposed to dangerous, unsanitary conditions. Two workers who ran away in San Francisco were granted visas as victims of human trafficking in 2010. They are now suing their boat owner. Hawaii's premium fish is sold everywhere from Costco and Sam's Club to Trump International Hotel Waikiki. Whole Foods suspended buying seafood from the fleet after the AP's initial report, while Costco says it is monitoring the situation. Trump Hotel and Wal-Mart, which owns Sam's Club, did not respond to requests for comment. The Hawaii Seafood Council recently surveyed crew members and assessed the fleet's working conditions. A draft of the findings, published online, finds some fishermen have contracts requiring them to pay for replacement workers if they break their agreements, or facing $5,000 fines for absconding — more than a year's salary for some. "There exists no system of grievance mechanisms for crew to voice concerns over pay," the report says. However, the assessment also found some fishermen had excellent relationships with their captains. All 207 men surveyed said they were being paid in cash, and none expressed concerns about forced labor or human trafficking. In Honolulu, most vessels dock at piers 17 and 38, which are guarded and patrolled, but some go as far as the West Coast. Customs says six fishermen were deported in 2016 after wandering away from their boats in Honolulu, some to visit friends on other vessels, others sneaking away for a drink. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice said agents checking out a number of leads related to possible human trafficking in the fleet have "identified instances where crew members were contending with less than ideal working conditions," but found no situations meeting the legal threshold to bring criminal charges. Some fishermen have good working conditions, but others lack clean drinking water or proper health care, and are fed just bait and rice, according to federal marine observers, who live with the men for weeks at a time. Many crew members are forced to use buckets as toilets. Uli Kozak, an Indonesian language professor at the University of Hawaii, said the men have spoken of physical abuse, including captains slapping them in the face. Sometimes when he visits to exchange goods for fresh fish, workers ask him to bring vegetables because of shortages on board, he said. "Very often they are in a situation where they have no choice," Kozak said.

About 700 of these foreign fisherman are currently confined to vessels in Honolulu without visas, some making less than $1 an hour. Hawaii authorities may have been violating their own state law for years by issuing commercial fishing licenses to thousands of foreign workers who were refused entry into the country, The Associated Press has found.

(AP Photo/Caleb Jones) Under state law, these workers — who make up most of the crew in a fleet catching $110 million worth of seafood annually — may not be allowed to fish at all, the AP found. A recent industry-sponsored assessment of crew members' treatment and living conditions found no human trafficking, but raised concerns that workers could be vulnerable to exploitation and said they have little recourse about paying fees or incurring debt in order to hold their jobs. "There exists no system of grievance mechanisms for crew to voice concerns over pay," according to the report. In this unique fishing arrangement facilitated by both federal and state officials, Hawaii's boat owners pay brokers up to $10,000 to bring each crew member from impoverished Southeast Asian and Pacific island nations. The men aren't allowed to arrive at Honolulu's airport because they lack visas, so they are instead flown to other countries and put on U.S.-owned fishing boats for long sails back to Hawaii. Before the men start working, they need a state commercial fishing license. In order to get it, Hawaii requires that they must be "lawfully admitted" to the U.S. Here's the hitch: When they arrive, they are met at the dock by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents who ban them from entering the country by stamping "refused" on their landing permits, which voids them. So instead of being "lawfully admitted," they are now barred by law from setting foot on U.S. soil. "Try taking a check to your bank that says 'void' on it and telling them, 'Oh, but they wrote the check to me,'" said Hawaii attorney Lance Collins, who advocates for the workers. Nonetheless, a written opinion by Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said the Department of Land and Natural Resources provides the landing permits as proof the fishermen are "lawfully admitted." U.S. Customs sees it differently. "NO. They cannot be admitted," spokesman Frank Falcon wrote in an email, adding that the stamp means they can't even enter the U.S. temporarily. In rare cases, including medical emergencies, Customs can parole the men to go ashore. Foreign crews on boats and aircraft, including cruise ship workers and flight attendants, fill out landing permits when they arrive in the U.S. Customs takes those applications and decides whether to allow each individual to temporarily enter the country. When landing permits are stamped refused, that serves as proof that authorities have been alerted that foreigners without visas are on arriving vessels or planes, and triggers an order for captains to detain them on board. Chin's office did not respond to AP's queries about the refusal stamp. However, Land and Natural Resources department spokesman Dan Dennison said in an email that the attorney general advised his agency to continue issuing fishing licenses to the foreign workers despite the fact that Customs says the men are not "lawfully admitted." The Hawaii Longline Association, which represents boat owners, says the men are legally hired for legitimate work on the fleet's 141 active vessels. And while the conditions and pay are often below U.S. standards, the jobs are typically better than the bleak opportunities the men have at home, mostly in the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia and the tiny Pacific island of Kiribati. Under federal law, U.S. citizens must make up 75 percent of the crew on most American commercial fishing boats. An AP investigation last year revealed Hawaii's fleet relies on a federal loophole allowing the foreign fishermen to work. In a hearing prompted by the AP report, Land and Natural Resources department administrator Bruce Anderson was asked why he issues commercial fishing licenses to foreign workers who can't enter the state. He said the crewman's landing permit "says in essence that the individual has the right to fish in U.S. waters but cannot step ashore." He did not mention that all the permits were stamped "refused." Democratic state Rep. Kaniela Ing, chairman of the Ocean, Marine Resources and Hawaiian Affairs committee, has queried Chin and other state officials at length about why the men cannot leave their boats. Ing said state officials failed to disclose the refusal stamp to him when he asked to see the landing permits. "It always seemed paradoxical that the proof of lawful entry was a landing form, but the crew members weren't allowed to land or leave the boat," he said, after the AP told him about the stamp. "We just didn't have the smoking gun evidence to point to why, and now we do." Critics say the fishing licenses could be just one of several ways the state is breaking its own laws: —The lowest-paid fishermen have contracts promising $300 a month, well below the state's wage minimums. The Labor Department says it doesn't intervene because the workers fall under federal, not state, jurisdiction. But department head Linda Chu Takayama also said she's awaiting further legal guidance. — Chin, the attorney general, said in his written opinion that employers in Hawaii typically cannot withhold wages, but some fishermen told the AP they are paid only after returning home when their one- or two-year contracts end. — Chin said telling consumers "that fish had been caught by local fishermen" may violate the state's deceptive practice laws if misinformation likely affects their shopping choices. The Hawaii Seafood Council claims the catch is "produced by Hawaii's hard-working fishermen." Council Program Manager John Kaneko did not respond to the AP. Federal law also is in question: U.S. Customs requires captains to detain the men on board and hold their passports because they are banned from entering the country. That potentially goes against U.S. human-trafficking laws saying bosses who possess workers' identification documents can face up to five years in prison. The foreign fishermen's catch is sold everywhere from Costco to Sam's Club and upscale restaurants across the U.S., including Trump International Hotel Waikiki. Whole Foods announced it would suspend buying seafood from the fleet after the AP's initial report, while Costco says it is monitoring the situation. The Trump hotel and Wal-Mart, which owns Sam's Club, did not provide an immediate response. The story also exposed dangerous, unsanitary conditions and at least two instances of human trafficking. It prompted new commitments from boat owners to protect the crew members' welfare. After a follow-up briefing on Capitol Hill, several members of Congress expressed "grave concerns" about working conditions in a letter to the Coast Guard and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Hawaii Seafood Council's survey of 207 fishermen identified a series of potential problems, particularly involving recruiting and payment of the foreign crew. Some fishermen had contracts requiring that part of their salaries or identification papers be withheld until they returned home. Others had signed agreements that said they had to pay for replacement workers if they broke their contracts, or faced $5,000 fines for absconding — equivalent to a year's salary for some. However, the assessment also found some fishermen had excellent relationships with their captains. All said they were being paid in cash, and none expressed concerns about forced labor or human trafficking. No one complained about access to food, but the report described one labor agent as saying that she had men on a boat who had not been paid for two months and that she bought groceries for fishermen at times when their boats ran out. The industry has implemented a new universal crew contract that requires owners to pay all recruiting fees and gives the fishermen their salaries within four days of landing. A draft Code of Conduct seeks to safeguard workers' rights. But there are no wage minimums as initially promised by Hawaii Longline Association president Sean Martin. The Honolulu Fish Auction now does business only with boats whose workers have signed those agreements. Martin declined to be interviewed, but he and other industry leaders have condemned labor abuses. They have said the workers are happy to have the jobs and typically do not complain, with many renewing their contracts and even recruiting relatives. Still, little has changed, with foreign crews typically spending three weeks a month at sea, working up to 20 hours a day, usually for far less than American fishermen nationwide, who average $2,500 a month. Their situation has been widely accepted as legal. The AP investigation is part of an ongoing global look at labor abuses in the fishing industry, stretching from Southeast Asia to America's own waters. In 2015, the AP reported on fishermen locked in a cage and others buried under fake names on the remote Indonesian island village of Benjina. Their catch was traced to the United States, leading to more than 2,000 slaves being freed. But thousands more remain trapped worldwide in a murky industry where work takes place far from shore and often without oversight. In Hawaii, most vessels dock at piers 17 and 38, which are guarded and patrolled, but some go as far as the West Coast. And, although technically not allowed, they do venture onto the piers briefly to socialize and use restrooms. Last year, Customs said six fishermen were deported after wandering away from their boats in Honolulu, some to visit friends on other vessels, others sneaking away for a drink. In 2010, two Indonesian fishermen who fled their boat in San Francisco alleging abuse were granted visas as victims of human trafficking and are now suing their former boat owner. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice said agents checking out a number of leads related to possible human trafficking in the fleet have "identified instances where crew members were contending with less than ideal working conditions," but found no situations meeting the legal threshold to bring criminal charges. Federal marine observers, who live with the men for weeks at a time at sea, said some fishermen have good working conditions while others are sometimes mistreated, not given proper health care, provided unclean drinking water and fed bait and rice. Many are forced to use buckets as toilets on board. Others in the community also have concerns. Uli Kozak, an Indonesian language professor at the University of Hawaii who has long exchanged home-cooked meals for fresh fish, said the workers sometimes ask for vegetables because of shortages on board. He said some captains have banned men from speaking their native language on boats. There's "a lot of verbal abuse, even physical abuse, being slapped in the face," Kozak said. "I have come across cases where people said, 'If I had ever known that it would be as bad as this, I would have never taken that job.'" ___ Follow Martha Mendoza and Margie Mason on Twitter at @mendozamartha and @MargieMasonAP In this Thursday, Feb. 2, 2017, photo, a man stands on a commercial fishing boat docked at Pier 38 in Honolulu.

Get the latest news from The Morning Call on the Amazon Echo ALERT Breaking News Legendary retailer Albert Boscov dies at 87 Severe weather alert in Northampton, Monroe and Carbon counties. February 11 LV Business Cycle Retail Analysis: Why Whole Foods is now struggling Why Whole Foods is now struggling On Feb. 8, Whole Foods reported its sixth consecutive quarter of falling same-store sales. The company is closing nine stores, according to the Washington Post, the most it has closed at one time. (Feb. 10, 2017) On Feb. 8, Whole Foods reported its sixth consecutive quarter of falling same-store sales. The company is closing nine stores, according to the Washington Post, the most it has closed at one time. (Feb. 10, 2017) Caitlin DeweyOf The Washington Post Analysis: Why Whole Foods is now struggling Organic food has never been so popular among American consumers. Ironically, that's bad news for the brand that made organic a household name — namely, the Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods. On Wednesday, Whole Foods reported what is arguably its worst performance in a decade, announcing its sixth consecutive quarter of falling same-store sales and cutting its outlook for the year. The company is closing nine stores, the most it has ever closed at one time. A mere 16 months ago, Whole Foods predicted it would grow its 470 U.S. locations to more than 1,200. In September, the company opened the Lehigh Valley's first Whole Foods supermarket at the Hamilton Crossings shopping center in Lower Macungie Township. The problem is one that chief executive John Mackey probably didn't predict when he first opened Whole Foods as a neighborhood natural foods store 36 years ago: Organics, then a fringe interest, have become so thoroughly mainstream that organic chains now have to face conventional big-box competitors. Mass-market retailers were responsible for 53.3 percent of organic food sales in 2015, according to the Organic Trade Association; natural retailers clocked in just north of 37. And Whole Foods is hardly the only store feeling the squeeze: Sprouts and Fresh Market, the second- and third-largest publicly traded organic stores, have also seen falling stock prices. PHOTO GALLERY: After a short ceremony, the doors swooshed open and the crowds pushed forward into the Valley’s newest supermarket. (Harry Fisher) "Whole Foods created this space and had it to all to themselves for years," said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones. "But in the past five years, a lot of people started piling in. And now there's a lot of competition." In many ways, the story of Whole Food's decline is also the story of how the organic movement took over America. Between 2005 and 2015, sales of organic food increased 209 percent, according to the Organic Trade Association. Last year, organic sales topped $43.3 billion. The driving force behind this growth, most analysts agree, is none other than millennials: Consumers aged 18 to 34 are the largest buyers of organics, and they're the most likely to consider themselves "knowledgeable" about their food. As they came of age, mainstream grocery chains have been forced to adapt, too. WATCH: Whole Foods opens in Lower Macungie Morning Call reporter Jen Sheehan takes a tour of Whole Food's newest store, which opened to the public in Lower Macungie Township. Morning Call reporter Jen Sheehan takes a tour of Whole Food's newest store, which opened to the public in Lower Macungie Township. See more videos Walmart ramped up its organics selection in 2006. Kroger introduced its Simple Truth brand in 2012 —the store's CEO Mike Ellis later said it was the store's "most successful brand launch ever." Earlier this week, Aldi announced plans for a $1.6-billion U.S. expansion, with much of that growth aimed at offering "a wider range of organic and gluten-free products." By volume, the largest organic retailer in the U.S. is currently believed to be Costco —which in 2015 sold $4 billion of organic produce and packaged foods. Like Walmart, Kroger and Aldi, Costco sells organic produce for considerably cheaper than do natural food stores, farmer's markets or Whole Foods. In fact, lowering prices has been one of Whole Food's primary strategies for dealing with competitors. Apart from shuttering stores and stalling expansion plans, the company is continuing to focus on "365 by Whole Foods," a two-year-old division aimed at launching stores for "value-conscious" consumers. It's also been dropping prices at its regular locations and mailing out national discount circulars, something it had not previously done. Speaking to investors on Wednesday, Mackey indicated that he did not want to see "too big of a gap" between the prices at Whole Foods and those at stores like Costco and Kroger. But some organic advocates are concerned that lowering the prices of organic foods - an apparent prerequisite for mainstream popularity - can only happen at the expense of the movement's early principles. This fear is not entirely new: Michael Pollan fretted about it in the pages of The New York Times when Walmart began selling organic Rice Krispie treats 11 years ago. But with results like Whole Foods, it is becoming more urgent, said Ronnie Cummins, the co-founder of the Organic Consumers Association. Cummins points out that some of the most successful, most mainstream organic products don't meet his organization's strict definition of what organic should be. Those include the ubiquitous Earthbound Farms, which grows its lettuces in monocultures, and Aurora Organic Dairy, which has been criticized for running its operation like an industrial factory farm. "If you're a publicly traded corporation, you have no choice but to maximize short-term profits," Cummins said. "But we are going to be complaining to Whole Foods if they decrease their quality to keep up with the competition." That approach may be most profitable now, he acknowledges — but Whole Foods needs to think long-term. After all, when the company was founded, there was barely even a market for organic foods.

Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Amid all the hurly-burly of President Donald Trump's first weeks in office, let's try to put the changes he's making and the feathers he's ruffling in a longer, 20-year perspective. Start off with his trademark issue -- one that clearly helped him win the 64 crucial electoral votes of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin: trade. Twenty years ago, Bill Clinton's administration was busy negotiating with China for normal trade relations. China's economy was growing rapidly. Its manufactures were inexpensive. And American firms looked with relish on a market of 1 billion customers with fast-growing incomes. Clinton's approach, supported by leading Republicans, was based on a lesson that every college student learns in Economics 101, whether taught by a Keynesian or a Milton Friedman fan. Free trade benefits both sides, with lower prices and increased economic growth. Clinton hustled to push "permanent normal trade relations" with China through Congress in the election year of 2000. There was broad support in the Senate, and the House passed an amendment establishing a commission to monitor China's human rights practices. It passed by a 237-197 margin, with 164 Republicans and 73 Democrats voting yes. Freer trade with China has benefited Americans in many ways. Your smartphone would cost a lot more without those components manufactured in China. The Department of Agriculture reports that it's cheaper, in real dollars, to buy clothing and toys for children than it was in the 1970s. Members of the elite who doubt this should visit a Wal-Mart or one of its competitors. But there have been downsides, too. China's huge and rapid economic surge is a phenomenon never seen before in history and likely never to be seen again. It would be surprising if its impact were not immediately apparent or entirely beneficial. A 2011 study co-conducted by MIT economist David Autor found, in the words of The Wall Street Journal, that in the United States, "regions most exposed to China tended not only to lose more manufacturing jobs, but also to see overall employment decline. Areas with higher exposure also had larger increases in workers receiving unemployment insurance, food stamps and disability payments." These effects may have been exacerbated by Obama-era legislation and regulations, which slowed growth generally. Autor and his colleagues noted last year that in areas most affected, adjustment has been slow, "with wages and labor-force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated." And "offsetting employment gains in other industries have yet to materialize." Someone at 725 Fifth Ave. noticed, and the effects are also apparent to reporters who bother to travel to counties where Trump ran well in the election. We're seeing men who are permanently without jobs and living off disability payments, rising death rates among middle-aged whites, and widespread opioid addiction. That has prompted at least one reporter who is no Trump fan, Time's Joe Klein, to ask: "Is the self-esteem inherent in manufacturing jobs long considered obsolete -- think of those grand old steel mills -- more important than the lower prices that the global market provides? Have we tilted too far toward market efficiency and too far away from social cohesion?" In addressing those questions, it's helpful to look back on one of the policy successes of the 1990s: welfare reform. Pioneered mainly by Republicans but also by some Democrats, pushed through Congress three times by Republicans and, after two vetoes, signed by Clinton in 1996, it limited welfare grants and required -- and helped -- welfare mothers to get jobs. Most research has shown positive results. Former welfare recipients reported a sense of pride and accomplishment, and many advanced up the economic ladder. They felt they set a good example for their children, and it's probably no coincidence that their children committed many fewer crimes than their counterparts a generation before. Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute (where I'm a resident fellow), has argued that the best ingredient for happiness and contentment is a sense of "earned success." It can be earned by raising a family, helping neighbors, contributing to charity and -- critical here -- working at a job. Welfare reform enabled many women to get a sense of earned success by working at a job. Globalized free trade, though having many good effects, seems to have prevented many men from getting a sense of earned success by depriving them of jobs. All of this suggests that the gross domestic product is not the only metric to evaluate President Trump's trade policies and that the answers to Joe Klein's questions aren't so clear as they have seemed to those of us who took Economics 101.

The unattributed (but also unchallenged) quote above suggests that White House officials, if not the president himself, feel these titans of industry,  including the heads of Disney, Wal-Mart, General Motors and IBM, should be thankful to pass through the high gates of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue — as if they were about to curry favors from the godfather. For Kalanick, the cost of this VIP access to the Strategic and Policy Forum was too high. Following Trump’s executive order on “extreme vetting” of Syrian refugees and immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries, Kalanick’s company was hit with a public relations crisis. The problem began Jan. 28 after Uber drivers ignored calls from local taxi drivers to stop picking up passengers from New York City’s JFK airport as part of a daylong nationwide demonstration. Anger against Uber quickly spread across social media with calls to ditch the popular ride-hailing service, a boycott that overwhelmed Uber’s computer systems with a flood of demands from customers to cancel their accounts. “Consumers know that they have the power to influence companies and their bottom lines and have become more [active] over the recent years,” said Leslie Gaines-Ross, chief reputation strategist for the New York-based PR firm Weber Shandwick. “Corporate reputations are at more risk than ever before because there is more scrutiny and a greater demand for transparency.” The anti-Uber protesters pivoted to focusing on Kalanick’s participation the policy forum, which led him to step down for damage-control purposes. Uber later joined 126 other companies (largely drawn from the tech industry) that have signed a friend of the court brief in support of the state of Washington’s legal challenge to Trump’s immigration order. On Thursday the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals maintained an injunction barring the president from enforcing his executive order while a Seattle federal judge continues to examine the legality of the order. “Travis was in a really difficult spot,” Steven Schwarzman, chairman, CEO and co-founder of private equity firm Blackstone who heads the president’s policy forum, told CNBC following the group’s first meeting with the president at the White House on Feb. 3. “His business was being adversely affected.” Such are the risks when CEOs decide to so publicly hobnob with national leaders, especially one like the current president, according to Paul Argenti, professor of corporate communications at Dartmouth University’s Tuck School of Business. “Getting involved with a president that is supremely controversial and somewhat mercurial in nature strikes me as a little more dangerous,” Argenti told Salon. “You have the proximity to him but you also have the proximity to him. You get the ability to whisper into his ear, but you also have the taint of being close to this guy.” Kalanick has certainly learned a lesson about being tainted by Trump, but what about the other members of the policy forum, which include Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. as well as Disney boss Bob Iger and the head of Wal-Mart, Doug McMillan?    “We are very focused on what this means to our employees and our company,” General Motors spokesman Patrick Morrissey said in an emailed statement to Salon when asked if policy forum member and GM CEO Mary Barra had come out in opposition to the executive order. “We feel quite strongly about valuing all people.” Six other of the companies and organizations represented in the policy forum have made similar statements, either publicly or through internal communications provided to media outlets, but have stopped short of challenging the president. GM, Cleveland Clinic, JPMorgan Chase, Disney, IBM, EY and BlackRock have made some or all of these three points — that they want to help their employees affected by the immigration ban, that they value inclusivity and that the order could adversely affect their businesses. (Notably silent has been Wal-Mart and five privately held firms.) What these companies didn’t do is publicly oppose Trump’s executive order in no uncertain terms. It’s not clear, for example, if any of these executives would be willing to walk away from the forum in protest if Trump harms their business and employees, not to mention undermine a core American principle about “huddled masses yearning to breathe free” with his blanket indefinite ban on Syrian war refugees. Only one member of the policy forum has joined Kalanick in taking an active stance in opposing Trump’s executive order: Tesla and SpaceX co-founder and CEO Elon Musk, who, like Kalanick, faced a barrage of criticism about his involvement in the policy forum. But instead of stepping down from the forum, Musk chose to remain a member while also joining Kalanick in supporting the friend of the court brief (through his companies SpaceX and Tesla) challenging the president’s ban. “Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer,” Musk wrote on his official Twitter feed on Sunday in response to calls on social media for him stop participating in the policy forum. “How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?” Argenti, who has written about and lectured on corporate-reputation issues, said that despite Musk’s decision to join the forum in the first place, he’s doing the right thing by doubling down and saying on the forum. “If you’re going to make a decision then stick by it, that’s my advice to companies,” he said. “If you really want to dive in and dive in whole hog and realize that the reputation of the CEO rubs off on the company and the reputation of the company.” More Angelo Young.

Year after year the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) told Congress and store patrons that commissary shoppers saved an average of at least 30 percent on brand name groceries over prices in commercial stores and supermarkets. The claim lost some credibility over time with the rise of big box discounters and retail supercenters. Also, DeCA’s price-tracking methodology lost support in Congress and at the Pentagon amid a push to transform commissaries into more business-like operations, using commercial tools such as variable pricing and private label brands to try to reduce DeCA’s $1.3 billion annual appropriation. DeCA officials now concede the 30-percent savings figure didn’t include price comparisons at Walmart Supercenters. Nor did it consider the popularity of private label goods that outside grocers find so profitable. Nor did DeCA adjust its own estimates to give greater weight to products in highest demand with lower savings. On Monday, in response to a congressional mandate, DeCA released new set of “baseline” estimates of commissary savings that reflect these factors and more. Without reducing the value of the shopping benefit, DeCA says, it has redefined how it measures savings. Global savings across all 238 commissaries, are calculated now at 23.7 percent and savings stateside at 20.2 percent. At 61 overseas commissaries, average savings are 44.2 percent against local food prices. To be able to shift to variable pricing, DeCA also is publishing average savings by seven U.S. commissary regions. The 36 commissaries operating on New England bases, for instance, provide average savings of 21.4 percent. Across 30 commissaries in the South Atlantic states, savings average 19.9 percent. The combined region of Alaska/Hawaii, with nine commissaries, offers the highest savings for patrons at 32.6 percent. Twenty commissaries in the Rocky Mountain region, which runs south from the Canadian border through Arizona and New Mexico, had the lowest savings of 17.6 percent compared to prices off base. The Pacific coastline states, with 31 commissaries, provide average savings of 20.9 percent while 18 military grocery stores in North Central states save shoppers an average of 20.2 percent. “This enhanced way of calculating savings doesn’t change the actual dollars that patrons save, but it will give patrons a better understanding of price comparisons in their local area,” said DeCA Director Joseph H. Jeu in a press release unveiling revised savings estimates. A day later Jeu announced that, effective June 3, he will retire after 6½ years at DeCA’s helm and more than 38 years’ total federal service. “The transformation is well on its way and the right people are in place to see it through,” Jeu’s statement said. Military exchange executives, said industry sources, were surprised and upset by DeCA’s announcement on the new baseline savings. Exchange directors have argued for years that their own store traffic and sales performance are linked to the popularity of commissaries, and commissary sales are falling. Since last October, start of fiscal 2017, DeCA sales are down 7.6 percent and by more than 10.5 percent in January compared to January last year. “It’s just really bleak,” said one representatives for manufacturers serving the military resale system. “If your sales are down, the last thing you want to do is send out a press release saying that people are saving 10 percent less than they thought they were. That’s just going to drive sales way down.” Some might challenge Jeu’s timing but he was on the clock. Congress first ordered DeCA to produce more realistic baseline savings, including across regions, in 2015. The due date to report was March 2016 so DeCA was 11 months late. Brooke Goldberg, director of family policy and spouse programs for Military Officers Association of America, said senior defense officials have given assurances if the revised savings rate “drops even 1 percent, DeCA will begin evaluating a corrective measure.” The hope is that a more glandular approach to tracking savings will “be good for patrons as it provides a more definitive benchmark on a regional basis rather than national scale,” Goldberg said. Some advocates for military families fear that the mere perception of lower savings could put commissaries at greater risk, despite DeCA’s vow that it only has clarified current savings in order to preserve them through the changes ahead. “I do think it means less certainty for families moving forward,” said Eileen Huck, government relations deputy director for National Military Family Association. “Families have always been told they could expect a certain level of savings when shopping at the commissary, regardless of where they happened to be stationed. “Now the rules of the game have changed somewhat. Although DeCA has stated its commitment to preserving this new level of savings, there are many more factors in play” including variable pricing of products and introduction of DeCA branded products later this year. So, said Huck, “it is fair for families to question what this will mean for the value of the commissary benefit in the long run.” For years DeCA measured shopper savings by comparing a 26-week average of brand name prices, always set at cost, against average market prices across the country. It used Nielsen price data and filled in any gaps — for Alaska, Hawaii and overseas — with limited manual price comparisons in those locales. That method of calculating savings for 38,000 branded items at the national level has been replaced by a new method more suited to the transformation. “We are adding more geographic specificity, since cost of living varies by region,” said a DeCA official. “Adding a regional savings level will provide a better sense for how much our patrons save by shopping at their local commissary, compared to retailers in their particular region.” DeCA has also updated the products it uses for our price comparisons, emphasizing “the most common patron purchases” within sales categories like produce or meat. The new savings benchmark also take into consideration patron purchases at local commercial grocers, as manually gathered in every region. Critics have raised concerns about how DeCA is relying more heavily now on “clipboard” pricing methods rather than Nielsen data to benchmark local savings across regions. But the greater worry is how patrons will react to the results. “It certainly has the potential to adversely affect patronage,” said Tom Gordy, president of the Armed Forces Marketing Council. “But what I think people have to fully understand is the prices have not changed. It’s just the way the savings are calculated has changed.” Another industry analyst was more skeptical, suggesting new baseline savings leave headroom for Defense officials or Congress to slash DeCA’s $1.3 budget while still claiming to preserve customer savings. He also pointed to a new Government Accountability Office report on DoD construction projects that showed DeCA surcharge dollars used to fund only one construction project in fiscal 2015. “Construction is the best manifestation of the health of the resale system,” he said. “This report indicates that the system might already be faltering.” To comment, email milupdate@aol.com Most Read Police: Attack by woman near Arlington was fueled by meth ARLINGTON — An Arlington woman is under investigation for assault and unlawful… Feb 10th, 2017 by Scott North Olivia Newton-John show to promote new album in Everett Olivia Newton-John — the movie star (“Grease”) and singer (“I Honestly Love… Feb 10th, 2017 by Gale Fiege Monroe man allegedly schemed to have wife, daughter murdered MONROE — A Monroe man is accused of trying to hire a… Feb 9th, 2017 by Rikki King Fugitive watch Herald staff EVERETT — The state Department of Corrections’ Everett office has… Feb 10th, 2017 by Herald Staff Julie Muhlstein Everett dog owners hope for the best at Westminster show Meet Zoom.

Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version 07:58 10 Feb 2017 Accendo Markets , Fri FTSE 100 Index called to open +30pts at 7260, extending yesterday’s gains to test 1-month intersecting resistance overnight. This maintains Wednesday’s bounce from 7150 and keeps alive the chance of the index regaining January’s 7365 all-time highs. Bulls need to see 7270 to be convinced of another breakout. Bears want to see 7250 give way to open the door for a retrace to yesterday’s 7230 at the very least. Watch levels: Bullish 7270, Bearish 7250. Calls for a positive open come after a strong day on Wall Street inspired by US tax cut hopes that spilled over to Asia overnight and received a second wind from surprisingly strong Chinese trade data that showed a rebound in Exports and acceleration in Imports that bolsters belief in transition to more consumption oriented economy. Japan’s Nikkei is outperforming thanks to a stronger USD and thus weaker Yen as well as energy stocks rebounding in tandem with oil prices. The same is true down under with Australia’s ASX, despite AUD strength at odds with poor home loan data and lower central bank growth forecasts, gaining as higher metals prices assist the all-important Miners. Wall Street soared yesterday as news of Donald Trump’s impending tax reforms saw investors flood into US equities, shying away from safe haven assets. Financials regained their title as foremost contributors on the Dow Jones, with Goldman Sachs leading the index 0.6% higher to a fresh record intraday and closing high, while retailers Nike and Wal-Mart were the biggest risers. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices also reached fresh all-time highs, both finishing the session 0.6% stronger. Both Brent Crude and US Crude have held above key levels despite the resurgent US dollar, having pared losses made on Tuesday this week. Both crude oil benchmarks will now have to overcome intersecting resistance levels, with Brent needing $56 to give way while the latter needs to hurdle the $53.20 mark. This evening’s Baker Hughes Rig count could provide direction for crude markets heading into next week, as the OPEC vs US shale gladiatorial match continues. The rally in equities both in the US and Asia overnight has had a subsequent impact on Gold, as investors shy away from the non-yielding safe haven asset. The precious metal has fallen back to $1223 having failed at $1243 resistance yesterday, breaking down from February rising lows support and throwing the validity of its bullish flag pattern into question. Further equity strength today could see gold come under further pressure today, In focus today will be the UK Trade Balance which is expected to see the deficit improve ever so slightly in December. Industrial Production is forecast to have slowed since November but accelerated on an annual basis to its fastest in over 5 years. Manufacturing Production is also expected to have slowed in Dec but rally to its best year-on-year since late 2014. Interestingly, UK Construction Output is seen doing the reverse, accelerating for the month but its yearly rate of advance falling negative for the first time since mid-2013. Keep an eye on FTSE housebuilders and construction names for any reaction. In the afternoon, with Inflation so key for the Fed’s outlook on hiking rates, US Import Price growth is seen largely unchanged at 0.4% in January but heating up to >3% annually, well above the Fed’s 2% stability target. Speakers include the ECB’s Mersch (9.50am) and Governing Council Member/Bundesbank Head Jens Weidmann (10am), both in Hamburg but at separate events, the former giving a presentation and the latter a leadership handover speech at the local Bundesbank office. Don’t forget US President Trump meets Japanese PM Abe today, offering potential for diplomatic faux pas aplenty.

Comment (1) aAFont Size Whole Foods Market Inc., facing its worst sales slump in more than a decade, is taking a step that would have been unthinkable in its highflying days: shrinking the size of the chain. Though Whole Foods plans to open six stores during the current quarter, including two relocations, the company said Wednesday that it's shutting down nine. That kind of retrenchment hasn't happened since the last recession was underway in 2008. The company said the stores targeted for closure include two each in California and Colorado and stores in Chicago, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona and Georgia. The company, which has about 440 U.S. stores, also said it was abandoning its ambitious growth target and no longer plans to reach 1,200 locations as it tries to get expenses under control. Six straight quarters of declining same-store sales -- a closely watched measure -- have forced the organic-food grocer to tighten its belt. Whole Foods also gave a forecast for the current year that offered little hope of a quick recovery. "This is a company that owned the space for a long time, but there's way too much competition now," said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones. "They've done several things to try and drive sales, and it's just not working." Same-store sales dropped 2.4 percent last quarter, worse than the 1.7 percent decrease predicted by analysts. The company now expects sales on that basis to decline as much as 2.5 percent this year, compared with an earlier forecast that was closer to breaking even. "People were hoping there would be some improvement," said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. "It's a bit concerning there's not a reversal happening there." Whole Foods has struggled to ward off competition from mainstream supermarkets, including Kroger and Wal-Mart Stores, which began offering more organic fare in recent years. And a bout of food deflation has put additional pressure on the entire industry. Some on Wall Street have been pushing Whole Foods to rein in its growth plans, and the store plan was received warmly. The stock rose $1.05, or 3.6 percent to close Thursday at $30.35. Responsibility for the turnaround is now squarely on John Mackey, a co-founder of the company who retook sole leadership last year. He had served as co-chief executive officer with Walter Robb until November. He has an uphill fight ahead. Same-store sales declined 3.2 percent in the current quarter through Feb. 5, a sign its troubles are worsening. The Austin, Texas-based company also said it would no longer be reporting quarter-to-date figures in future reports, meaning investors will have less to go on. Whole Foods' struggles have fueled speculation that an activist investor could take on the chain, and one of its largest shareholders is said to have to discussed agitating for sweeping changes. For years, Whole Foods offered products that were tough to find elsewhere, and the shares gave investors exposure to the fast-growing market for organic and natural food. But that advantage has eroded in recent years. With sales growth stagnating last year, Whole Foods announced $300 million in cost cuts. But the company is still ramping up spending elsewhere, including on marketing and technology, and that's expected to offset the cutbacks. It also introduced a new store concept last year aimed at younger, budget-conscious consumers. So far, only three of the locations -- dubbed 365 by Whole Foods Market -- have opened on the West Coast. The company announced on Wednesday that it has signed leases for new 365 stores in Brooklyn, N.Y., and Oakland, Calif. The new concept, named after the company's private-label brand, is seen as a way for Whole Foods to connect with shoppers who perceive the chain's conventional stores as too pricey. Whole Foods considered turning some of the stores it was closing into 365 locations, but it wasn't practical, Mackey said. In some cases the company wanted to thin out its presence in a particular market, with the hope that it benefits Whole Foods locations nearby. Some of the stores had lease renewals coming up in 2017, and management decided to accelerate the process and close them now. The decision to close the nine stores will help improve profits and comparable sales, Mackey said during a conference call. The company is taking a more disciplined approach to growth but still has 80 stores in the pipeline, he said. "We cleaned up the stores we needed to clean up for the time being, and we're looking forward to moving forward," Mackey said.

(Reuters photo: Eduardo Munoz) Share article on Facebookshare Tweet articletweet Plus one article on Google Plus+1 Print Article Adjust font size AA AA AA AA AA AA AA by Michael Barone February 10, 2017 12:00 AM @michaelbarone Cheaper goods don’t provide satisfaction like meaningful work does. Amid all the hurly-burly of President Donald Trump’s first weeks in office, let’s try to put the changes he’s making and the feathers he’s ruffling in a longer, 20-year perspective. Start off with his trademark issue — one that clearly helped him win the 64 crucial electoral votes of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin: trade. Twenty years ago, Bill Clinton’s administration was busy negotiating with China for normal trade relations. China’s economy was growing rapidly. Its manufactures were inexpensive. And American firms looked with relish on a market of 1 billion customers with fast-growing incomes. Clinton’s approach, supported by leading Republicans, was based on a lesson that every college student learns in Economics 101, whether taught by a Keynesian or a Milton Friedman fan. Free trade benefits both sides, with lower prices and increased economic growth. Clinton hustled to push “permanent normal trade relations” with China through Congress in the election year of 2000. There was broad support in the Senate, and the House passed an amendment establishing a commission to monitor China’s human-rights practices. It passed by a 237–197 margin, with 164 Republicans and 73 Democrats voting yes. Freer trade with China has benefited Americans in many ways. Your smartphone would cost a lot more without those components manufactured in China. The Department of Agriculture reports that it’s cheaper, in real dollars, to buy clothing and toys for children than it was in the 1970s. Members of the elite who doubt this should visit a Walmart or one of its competitors. But there have been downsides, too. China’s huge and rapid economic surge is a phenomenon never seen before in history and likely never to be seen again. It would be surprising if its impact were not immediately apparent or entirely beneficial. A 2011 study co-conducted by MIT economist David Autor found, in the words of the Wall Street Journal, that in the United States, “regions most exposed to China tended not only to lose more manufacturing jobs, but also to see overall employment decline. Areas with higher exposure also had larger increases in workers receiving unemployment insurance, food stamps, and disability payments.” These effects may have been exacerbated by Obama-era legislation and regulations, which slowed growth generally. Autor and his colleagues noted last year that in areas most affected, adjustment has been slow, “with wages and labor-force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated.” And “offsetting employment gains in other industries have yet to materialize.” Globalized free trade, though having many good effects, seems to have prevented many men from getting a sense of earned success by depriving them of jobs. Someone at 725 Fifth Ave. noticed, and the effects are also apparent to reporters who bother to travel to counties where Trump ran well in the election. We’re seeing men who are permanently without jobs and living off disability payments, rising death rates among middle-aged whites, and widespread opioid addiction. That has prompted at least one reporter who is no Trump fan, Time’s Joe Klein, to ask: “Is the self-esteem inherent in manufacturing jobs long considered obsolete — think of those grand old steel mills — more important than the lower prices that the global market provides? Have we tilted too far toward market efficiency and too far away from social cohesion?” In addressing those questions, it’s helpful to look back on one of the policy successes of the 1990s: welfare reform. Pioneered mainly by Republicans but also by some Democrats, pushed through Congress three times by Republicans and, after two vetoes, signed by Clinton in 1996, it limited welfare grants and required — and helped — welfare mothers to get jobs. Most research has shown positive results. Former welfare recipients reported a sense of pride and accomplishment, and many advanced up the economic ladder. They felt they set a good example for their children, and it’s probably no coincidence that their children committed many fewer crimes than their counterparts a generation before. Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute (where I’m a resident fellow), has argued that the best ingredient for happiness and contentment is a sense of “earned success.” It can be earned by raising a family, helping neighbors, contributing to charity and — critical here — working at a job. Welfare reform enabled many women to get a sense of earned success by working at a job. Globalized free trade, though having many good effects, seems to have prevented many men from getting a sense of earned success by depriving them of jobs. All of this suggests that the gross domestic product is not the only metric to evaluate President Trump’s trade policies and that the answers to Joe Klein’s questions aren’t so clear as they have seemed to those of us who took Economics 101. —Michael Barone is a senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and longtime co-author of The Almanac of American Politics. © 2017 Creators.com Load More Photo Essay Defending America About Institute Advertise Contact NR Facebook Twitter Google+ Privacy

Enquirer , KHOU 7:30 PM. CST February 09, 2017 Kellogg's cereals, including Special K, are seen at a store in Arlington, Virginia, December 1, 2016. SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images (Photo: SAUL LOEB, This content is subject to copyright.) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST BATTLE CREEK, Mich. — Kellogg (K) could lay off more than 1,100 employees because of its decision to use grocers' warehouses rather than directly deliver many of its foods to store shelves. The company said Wednesday it plans to begin exiting its direct store delivery network in favor of retailers' warehouses in the second quarter of this year. As a result, the company will close 39 of its distribution centers. Those sites average about 30 full-time workers, Kellogg spokeswoman Kris Charles said. That's the equivalent of about 1,170 jobs. Closures are expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of this year. The change comes as the grocery industry itself is changing: Online sales of staples are increasing and national retailers such as Walmart and Target have focused more on food sales. "While this is the right move for the company to achieve our long-term objectives, it was a difficult decision because of its impact on some sales and distribution employees," Charles said in an email statement. Kellogg — which makes Eggo frozen waffles, Kashi products, Keebler cookies and crackers, MorningStar Farms meatless foods, Pop-Tarts and Pringles in addition to its cereals — already uses the warehouse system for some of its products, including Pringles and its frozen foods. But its cereals, cookies, crackers and crisps most often are delivered through direct sales teams, according to the company's 2015 annual report. The closures "will not have a sizable impact on any one community," including Battle Creek where Kellogg has its headquarters, Charles said. The company did not immediately provide a list of communities affected but about half are identifiable because of an online presence: • In Cicero, N.Y., the company will close a distribution center with 30 workers, The (Syracuse, N.Y.) Post Standard reported. • In Hagerstown, Md., its distribution center, also on the shutdown list, employs 85 people, The (Hagerstown, Md.) Herald-Mail reported. • In Warren, Ohio, a Kellogg distribution center will close by the end of the year, The (Youngstown, Ohio) Vindicator reported. Online job boards show that Kellogg was advertising openings at distribution centers in Elmhurst, Ill.; Hartford, Conn.; Loudon, Tenn.; Oklahoma City; Orlando; and San Antonio. Additional distribution centers are in Atlanta; Augusta, Ga.; Auburn, Maine; Breinigsville, Pa.; Fontana, Calif.; Franklin, Mass.; Jackson, Tenn.; Menomonee Falls, Wis.; Muncy, Pa.; Omaha, Neb.; Phoenix; San Jose, Calif.; and Sharonville, Ohio. Detroit is the company's only distribution center in Michigan, Charles said. ► Related: Breitbart launches #DumpKelloggs campaign after brand pulls ads The move reiterates "how serious we are at creating a more competitive and a faster-growing snack business," said President Paul Norman of Kellogg North America on the company's investor call Thursday. The decision frees up money for other areas such as brand building, Norman said. "(It's) a very difficult decision," he said. "We firmly believe this is the right move for our business as we look forward to changing consumer and shopper trends." Kellogg's core cereal sales have been under strain as consumers find themselves rushed to get out of the house in the morning and store brands that families turned to during the recession eat into market share for the big brands: Kellogg, Post and General Mills. Kellogg's cost-cutting program, dubbed Project K and first introduced in 2013, will be extended into 2019, said Ron Dissinger, outgoing Kellogg chief financial officer. Project K, designed to promote efficiency and reshape the business, has resulted in a number of layoffs, including last month's decision to cut 250 North American jobs. It had been scheduled to end this year. On Thursday, the company reported a loss of $53 million in the fourth quarter although profits were up 28% to $1.4 billion for the year. Adjusted earnings for the quarter were 92 cents a share, $3.74 for all of 2016, surpassing Wall Street expectations. It's stock price was up about 4% to $76.47 a share in Thursday afternoon trading.

(Photo: Joel Angel Juarez/ZUMA Press/Splash News/Newscom) New Deal-era legislation is causing major headaches for Wisconsin’s consumers and businesses. A law that has been on the books in Wisconsin since 1939 forces consumers to pay an extra 9 percent on fuel, in the name of fairness. A report by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute examined the law and its impact on consumers and business owners in the Badger State. The Unfair Sales Act was enacted to stop a “flood of small-business bankruptcies during the Great Depression,” according to the institute’s report, which was released last year. The law initially applied to all merchandise and required retailers not to sell anything for less than 8 percent more than what they paid for it at cost.    To avoid “predatory pricing,” the law was designed to stop retailers from lowering prices so much that competitors would go out of business, after which the original retailer could raise prices again. Several legislative changes over the years updated the law, but rules are still in place for alcohol, tobacco, and motor vehicle fuel. According to the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute’s report, alcohol and tobacco products may not be sold below cost. The definition of “cost” includes a presumptive 3 percent markup by wholesalers and 6 percent markup by retailers. Motor fuel must be marked up 9.18 percent above the “average posted terminal price,” determined by an independent oil-price-survey company every day. The Unfair Sales Act also states that general merchandise may not be sold below cost by wholesalers or retailers. Exceptions to these rules are made for matching a competitor’s price (which turns out to be the crux of many disputes over the law), or for clearance or liquidation sales, as well as the sale of perishables or damaged goods. The law does not apply to services. Rick Lemke, who owns a gas station and car repair garage in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, said he thinks the state should repeal the law, but that the regulation of gas prices serves a purpose. There’s an exception to the unfair competition law that says a retailer is allowed to sell their product for below the minimum markup rate to meet a competitor’s price. This most often plays out with gasoline because, as Lemke pointed out, it’s the only product that has to have a price posted along the roadside for consumers to see. If his competitor sells gas for less than what the law requires, he can do the same, as long as he fills out a “Notice of Meeting Competition” form and sends it to the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture. Lemke said every day he must drive around town, observe his competitors’ prices on gas, report who is selling for less than markup, and file paperwork so that he won’t get in trouble for selling his gas at the same or lower price. “I would like to see the law repealed because it creates paperwork on my part every day,” he said. “You’re automatically assumed in violation of the law if you don’t have the paperwork.” While the law causes him extra work, Lemke said he’s glad the law keeps big companies, like Meijer or Wal-Mart, from selling gas at a loss while making money elsewhere in the store. Such practices could put small shops out of business, he said. A Wal-Mart gas station in Florida. (Photo: St Petersburg Times/ZUMAPRESS/Newscom) Wisconsin is not the only state with minimum markup or unfair competition laws. According to a 2006 article by the Foundation for Economic Education, many states—including Michigan, Maryland, and New York—have similar laws, “however, none are as extreme as the one in Wisconsin, where fuel taxes are also among the highest in the nation.” Michael LaFaive, director of the Morey Fiscal Policy Initiative at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy in Michigan, said the law is outdated and a burden on consumers. “It’s a suffocating economic mandate that has been around too long for its own good. It’s an anachronism,” he said. LaFaive has done extensive research on Michigan’s liquor control laws, which are similar to Wisconsin’s minimum markup laws, and lead to high prices on alcohol. But, he said Wisconsin’s law is much more pervasive and suffocating than Michigan’s. “This is protectionist legislation that was born of a different era,” he said. “Protectionist sentiments are universal. I see them everywhere.” Salim Furth, a research fellow in macroeconomics at The Heritage Foundation, called these laws a price gouge. “There is, generally speaking, no justification for a law of this type,” he said. “The defenders will cite the idea of monopoly protection, but a monopoly wouldn’t be stopped by this law: large markups are exactly what a monopolist would do. Low markups are a hallmark of competition, not monopoly.” Several of the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute report’s authors interviewed consumers around the state and found that many of them say they think the free market should determine gas prices, not a law. One woman quoted in the report sums it up this way: “We purchase gas wherever we can get the best deal.” The minimum markup law hurts consumers, LaFaive said. “No consumer ever got killed in a price war,” he said. “If they’re defending this law based on a [potential] price war, they’re admitting that consumers come second.” He called the laws “economically harmful and unfair.” While proponents of the law say it keeps small businesses in competition with big stores, LaFaive said big stores can’t be blamed for succeeding in a free market. Several consumers in the report stated that they will shop wherever they can get the best price, whether it be a big box store or a mom-and-pop shop. Another shopper said she thinks long-established, small stores would survive if the markup law was repealed because of a dedicated clientele, even if their prices are slightly higher. In 2009, the minimum markup law nearly died after a federal judge ruled on a suit involving gas station chain Flying J. The judge said the minimum markup law violated the federal Sherman Antitrust Act, according to the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute’s report. Both the attorney general and governor of Wisconsin at the time (one a Republican and one a Democrat) decided not to appeal the decision. However, a trade association supporting the gas and convenience store industry in Wisconsin was granted an appeal, which overturned the federal judge’s decision. So, opponents of the law have turned to the state Legislature to try to repeal it.   The most interesting part of his research, report contributor Dave Daley said, was discovering that the state government has the equivalent of two employees responsible for enforcing minimum markup laws, and that they do not actively look for offenders. The employees receive complaint forms from businesses claiming that another company is not following minimum markup rules. The two employees can then issue warning letters to the supposed offenders and, if necessary, can refer a case to a local prosecutor, though no cases have been referred for more than 10 years, according to the report. “The research seems to show that the state is doing the minimum it has to to make offenders aware of law,” Daley said. “It has more of an impact on some of these businesses being forced to jump through hoops, especially gas stations. No matter what you want to charge, you have to deal with the minimum markup law.” The Daily Signal depends on the support of readers like you.

Lawrence "Larry" Johnson, 69, was considered a missing and endangered person by police, who said he was last seen on foot early Thursday, Jan. 26, behind a Crystal Lake Walmart at 1205 S. Route 31. On Monday, a construction worker found a body in the mud in a construction area near the 8000 block of South Route 31 south of Rakow Road -- about a half-mile from the Walmart. An autopsy conducted Thursday determined hypothermia played a role in Johnson's death. No other evidence of trauma or suspicious circumstances were found, coroner's officials said.

Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images Share Share Tweet Share Comment Email Print advertisement President Donald Trump convened with the heads of some of America's largest corporations on Friday at the White House for a meeting intended to make good on the administration's pledge to reduce regulation, promote women in the workplace, and cut taxes. Meeting with biggest business leaders this morning. Good jobs are coming back to U.S., health care and tax bills are being crafted NOW!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2017 Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric, told CNBC it had been a "fabulous meeting" and said the president "engaged forcefully" on every topic. Steve Schwarzman, CEO of private equity firm Blackstone and chairman of the council that arranged Friday's meeting, said the session had been "spirited intellectually" and that the members had had a "balanced discussion" about "taxes, trade, infrastructure, women's issues, education, and how to bring home jobs in terms of training people in technology." Other attendees at Friday's business huddle included members of Trump's economic advisory council, such as JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon, Walt Disney's Bob Iger, Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon, and Mary Barra of General Motors. The meeting also included First Daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, senior adviser to the president; as well as Vice President Mike Pence and White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon. One notable absentee was Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who resigned from his spot on the president's council Thursday amid fierce backlash from customers furious at Kalanick's seeming connection to Trump's controversial immigration ban that limits travel to America from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Kalanick said Thursday that his participation on Trump's council was not meant to be construed as any endorsement of Trump's policies. However, billionaire inventor and environmentalist Elon Musk, also heavily criticized for his position on the board due to seemingly contradictory stances with Trump, has not shied away from his role. In contrast to Kalanick, Musk tweeted a message on Thursday explaining that he was remaining on the board in order to "serve the greater good." Regarding the meeting at the White House: pic.twitter.com/8b1XH4oW6h— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 3, 2017 Corporate America is struggling to please an increasing divide: Customers and investors who oppose Trump's hard-line policies, and those who applaud his strong-arm techniques. And many business leaders on the president's council are stuck between a rock and a hard place as they seek to advise — or at least appease — the president while remaining firm on their own values and satisfying those of their client base. Related: Many CEOs 'Scared Out of Their Minds', Won't Speak Out Against Trump Trump has already called out several major companies via Twitter, including General Motors, L.L. Bean, and Ford. In December, he tweeted, "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" Following his tweet, Boeing stocks slid by more than 1 percent in premarket trade.

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next INDEPENDENCE, Mo - It’s business as usual at the Independence McDonald’s where one of its managers says he got pesticide poisoning and is concerned he may not be the only one. On Wednesday at 11 p.m. William Wayman showed up for his overnight shift as a manager at the McDonald’s on 23rd and Sterling. When Wayman walked in, he said he saw the manager before him set up three bug bombs. "I had seen him setting up the foggers and after he set up the foggers he just immediately walked out the door and left,” Wayman said. According to him, the bug bombs were placed by the ice cream machine, another by a trash can near the the entrance and a third by the men’s bathroom. "I ended up shutting the store down at 11:30 after I contacted poison control and a couple of other 24 hour restaurants to see you what they thought about the situation and they advised me that it's a health code violations and that I need to shut down immediately,” Wayman said. But by then it was too late for him. “I'd seen it in the air with me being up front where is that it's very burning my eyes and I started crying,” Wayman said. Wayman said he threw away cups, plastic ware, straws and napkins that were exposed to the bug bombs before reopening before breakfast. He went to the hospital where doctors told him he had pesticide poisoning. Wayman filed a complaint with the Independence Health Department. "Anytime we receive a complaint what we do is we start the case we go out to our inspector to look for any violations that they can observe we try to contact the complainant and try to get as much information as we can and follow up as appropriate,” Christina Heinen, the assistant health director for Independence, Missouri said.  41 Action News found this McDonald’s health inspection. Three were done in 2015  and one last year. None of them show a problem with pests. But Wayman said gnats are an issue. “Since I've been there they've had Ecolab out twice for our gnat problem and it seems not to of helped out at all so they took it upon themselves to buy foggers from Walmart or Dollar Tree or something and set them off themselves,” Wayman said.  In a statement from a McDonald's restaurant representative: "Our first and foremost concern is for the safety of our customers and employees. Upon awareness of this incident, we took immediate action. We are working closely with the employee and health department to address the situation and ensure that safety protocols are in place. We remain committed to serving the highest quality of food and maintaining our customer’s confidence and our employees who serve them. The restaurant was closed, no food was served and proper protocol for clean up was in place before opening."  Wayman said that wasn’t the case initially, which is why he posted this message on Facebook. “Just to make the community aware of exactly what kind of fast food establishment they're getting food from. That they're children are eating at the potential of customers. That I did serve in the 30 minutes that I did take orders. That they could have the poisoning themselves,” Wayman said.  41 Action News did ask the health department if any customers who visited the McDonald’s on Wednesday between 11 and 11:30 p.m. should be worried about any exposure but they refused to comment citing this is still an ongoing investigation.  Editor's Note: A previous version of this story attributed a statement to Trozzolo.

A woman was looking for a rental home on Facebook, and before indicating any interest or providing any information, someone sent her an application to fill out. She did not reply. 9:25 a.m. On the 600 block of West Victory Way, officers responded to a report of a vehicle accident. 11:36 a.m. At an undisclosed location, officers responded to a report of a possible sex assault. The incident is under investigation. 2:45 p.m. At East Sixth Street and Yampa Avenue, officers responded to a report of a multi-vehicle crash. A woman was arrested for driving under the influence of drugs and careless driving after running a red light. 3:53 p.m. On the 2200 block of Jeffcoat Drive, officers followed up on an animal abuse complaint. 5:56 p.m. On the 1100 block of Breeze Street, officers responded to a report of fraud.

In this Thursday, Feb. 2, 2017, photo, a catch of fish is unloaded from a commercial fishing boat at Pier 38 in Honolulu. Hawaii authorities may have been violating their own state laws for years by issuing commercial fishing licenses to thousands of foreign workers who have been refused entry into the United States, The Associated Press has found. About 700 of these men are currently confined to vessels in Honolulu without visas, some making less than $1 an hour. (AP Photo/Caleb Jones) HONOLULU – Hawaii authorities may have been violating their own state law for years by issuing commercial fishing licenses to thousands of foreign workers who were refused entry into the country, The Associated Press has found. About 700 of these men are currently confined to vessels in Honolulu without visas, some making less than $1 an hour. They work without most basic labour protections just a few miles from Waikiki’s white sand beaches, catching premium tuna and swordfish sold at some of America’s most upscale grocery stores, hotels and restaurants. The AP found that under state law, these workers – who make up most of the crew in a fleet catching $110 million worth of seafood annually – may not be allowed to fish at all. A recent industry-sponsored assessment of crew members’ treatment and living conditions found no human trafficking, but raised concerns that workers could be vulnerable to exploitation and said they have little recourse about paying fees or incurring debt in order to hold their jobs. “There exists no system of grievance mechanisms for crew to voice concerns over pay,” according to the report. In this unique fishing arrangement facilitated by both federal and state officials, Hawaii’s boat owners pay brokers up to $10,000 to bring each crew member from impoverished Southeast Asian and Pacific island nations. The men aren’t allowed to arrive at Honolulu’s airport because they lack visas, so they are instead flown to other countries and put on U.S.-owned fishing boats for long sails back to Hawaii. Before the men start working, they need a state commercial fishing license. In order to get it, Hawaii requires that they must be “lawfully admitted” to the U.S. Here’s the hitch: When they arrive, they are met at the dock by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents who ban them from entering the country by stamping “refused” on their landing permits, which voids them. So instead of being “lawfully admitted,” they are now barred by law from setting foot on U.S. soil. “Try taking a check to your bank that says ‘void’ on it and telling them, ‘Oh, but they wrote the check to me,'” said Hawaii attorney Lance Collins, who advocates for the workers. Nonetheless, a written opinion by Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said the Department of Land and Natural Resources provides the landing permits as proof the fishermen are “lawfully admitted.” U.S. Customs sees it differently. “NO. They cannot be admitted,” spokesman Frank Falcon wrote in an email, adding that the stamp means they can’t even enter the U.S. temporarily. In rare cases, including medical emergencies, Customs can parole the men to go ashore. Foreign crews on boats and aircraft, including cruise ship workers and flight attendants, fill out landing permits when they arrive in the U.S. Customs takes those applications and decides whether to allow each individual to temporarily enter the country. When landing permits are stamped refused, that serves as proof that authorities have been alerted that foreigners without visas are on arriving vessels or planes, and triggers an order for captains to detain them on board. Chin’s office did not respond to AP’s queries about the refusal stamp. However, Land and Natural Resources department spokesman Dan Dennison said in an email that the attorney general advised his agency to continue issuing fishing licenses to the foreign workers despite the fact that Customs says the men are not “lawfully admitted.” The Hawaii Longline Association, which represents boat owners, says the men are legally hired for legitimate work on the fleet’s 141 active vessels. And while the conditions and pay are often below U.S. standards, the jobs are typically better than the bleak opportunities the men have at home, mostly in the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia and the tiny Pacific island of Kiribati. Under federal law, U.S. citizens must make up 75 per cent of the crew on most American commercial fishing boats. An AP investigation last year revealed Hawaii’s fleet relies on a federal loophole allowing the foreign fishermen to work. In a hearing prompted by the AP report, Land and Natural Resources department administrator Bruce Anderson was asked why he issues commercial fishing licenses to foreign workers who can’t enter the state. He said the crewman’s landing permit “says in essence that the individual has the right to fish in U.S. waters but cannot step ashore.” He did not mention that all the permits were stamped “refused.” Democratic state Rep. Kaniela Ing, chairman of the Ocean, Marine Resources and Hawaiian Affairs committee, has queried Chin and other state officials at length about why the men cannot leave their boats. Ing said state officials failed to disclose the refusal stamp to him when he asked to see the landing permits. “It always seemed paradoxical that the proof of lawful entry was a landing form, but the crew members weren’t allowed to land or leave the boat,” he said, after the AP told him about the stamp. “We just didn’t have the smoking gun evidence to point to why, and now we do.” Critics say the fishing licenses could be just one of several ways the state is breaking its own laws: – The lowest-paid fishermen have contracts promising $300 a month, well below the state’s wage minimums. The Labor Department says it doesn’t intervene because the workers fall under federal, not state, jurisdiction. But department head Linda Chu Takayama also said she’s awaiting further legal guidance. – Chin, the attorney general, said in his written opinion that employers in Hawaii typically cannot withhold wages, but some fishermen told the AP they are paid only after returning home when their one- or two-year contracts end. – Chin said telling consumers “that fish had been caught by local fishermen” may violate the state’s deceptive practice laws if misinformation likely affects their shopping choices. The Hawaii Seafood Council claims the catch is “produced by Hawaii’s hard-working fishermen.” Council Program Manager John Kaneko did not respond to the AP. Federal law also is in question: U.S. Customs requires captains to detain the men on board and hold their passports because they are banned from entering the country. That potentially goes against U.S. human-trafficking laws saying bosses who possess workers’ identification documents can face up to five years in prison. The foreign fishermen’s catch is sold everywhere from Costco to Sam’s Club and upscale restaurants across the U.S., including Trump International Hotel Waikiki. Whole Foods announced it would suspend buying seafood from the fleet after the AP’s initial report, while Costco says it is monitoring the situation. The Trump hotel and Wal-Mart, which owns Sam’s Club, did not provide an immediate response. The story also exposed dangerous, unsanitary conditions and at least two instances of human trafficking. It prompted new commitments from boat owners to protect the crew members’ welfare. After a follow-up briefing on Capitol Hill, several members of Congress expressed “grave concerns” about working conditions in a letter to the Coast Guard and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Hawaii Seafood Council’s survey of 207 fishermen identified a series of potential problems, particularly involving recruiting and payment of the foreign crew. Some fishermen had contracts requiring that part of their salaries or identification papers be withheld until they returned home. Others had signed agreements that said they had to pay for replacement workers if they broke their contracts, or faced $5,000 fines for absconding – equivalent to a year’s salary for some. However, the assessment also found some fishermen had excellent relationships with their captains. All said they were being paid in cash, and none expressed concerns about forced labour or human trafficking. No one complained about access to food, but the report described one labour agent as saying that she had men on a boat who had not been paid for two months and that she bought groceries for fishermen at times when their boats ran out. The industry has implemented a new universal crew contract that requires owners to pay all recruiting fees and gives the fishermen their salaries within four days of landing. A draft Code of Conduct seeks to safeguard workers’ rights. But there are no wage minimums as initially promised by Hawaii Longline Association president Sean Martin. The Honolulu Fish Auction now does business only with boats whose workers have signed those agreements. Martin declined to be interviewed, but he and other industry leaders have condemned labour abuses. They have said the workers are happy to have the jobs and typically do not complain, with many renewing their contracts and even recruiting relatives. Still, little has changed, with foreign crews typically spending three weeks a month at sea, working up to 20 hours a day, usually for far less than American fishermen nationwide, who average $2,500 a month. Their situation has been widely accepted as legal. The AP investigation is part of an ongoing global look at labour abuses in the fishing industry, stretching from Southeast Asia to America’s own waters. In 2015, the AP reported on fishermen locked in a cage and others buried under fake names on the remote Indonesian island village of Benjina. Their catch was traced to the United States, leading to more than 2,000 slaves being freed. But thousands more remain trapped worldwide in a murky industry where work takes place far from shore and often without oversight. In Hawaii, most vessels dock at piers 17 and 38, which are guarded and patrolled, but some go as far as the West Coast. And, although technically not allowed, they do venture onto the piers briefly to socialize and use restrooms. Last year, Customs said six fishermen were deported after wandering away from their boats in Honolulu, some to visit friends on other vessels, others sneaking away for a drink. In 2010, two Indonesian fishermen who fled their boat in San Francisco alleging abuse were granted visas as victims of human trafficking and are now suing their former boat owner. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice said agents checking out a number of leads related to possible human trafficking in the fleet have “identified instances where crew members were contending with less than ideal working conditions,” but found no situations meeting the legal threshold to bring criminal charges. Federal marine observers, who live with the men for weeks at a time at sea, said some fishermen have good working conditions while others are sometimes mistreated, not given proper health care, provided unclean drinking water and fed bait and rice. Many are forced to use buckets as toilets on board. Others in the community also have concerns. Uli Kozak, an Indonesian language professor at the University of Hawaii who has long exchanged home-cooked meals for fresh fish, said the workers sometimes ask for vegetables because of shortages on board. He said some captains have banned men from speaking their native language on boats. There’s “a lot of verbal abuse, even physical abuse, being slapped in the face,” Kozak said. “I have come across cases where people said, ‘If I had ever known that it would be as bad as this, I would have never taken that job.'” ___ Follow Martha Mendoza and Margie Mason on Twitter at @mendozamartha and @MargieMasonAP 000000 000000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Since he was elected, President Donald Trump has taken the driver's seat for markets, pushing the obsessive focus on the Fed aside, with his promises of big pro-growth fiscal policies impacting market expectations. But the current back seat driver could grab the wheel for at least two days in the coming week, when Fed Chair Janet Yellen testifies before Senate and House committees on the economy and Fed policy. "Certainly investors are paying close attention and given the fact the VIX is … at some crazy low number, it's possible we see a volatility pop," said Jack Ablin, CIO of BMO Private Bank. The VIX, the CBOE's volatility index, was at a low reading of 10 on Friday, indicating to some a high level of market complacency, as stocks leap to record highs. "Just like last year, they [the Fed] started the year with a forecast where were going to have four rate hikes, and we got one. I think the same thing this year. Her rhetoric could be construed as hawkish but with very little action," said Ablin. On Wall Street, traders are waiting to hear if Yellen signals that the Fed is on track to raise interest rates three times this year, as it forecasts, and the timing of when it might next move. Analysts also expect to hear pointed questions aimed at the Fed's own policies and what Yellen thinks about potential new tax policy, fiscal stimulus, banking deregulation and efforts to exert new supervision over the Fed itself. Ablin expects Yellen to be circumspect, given the scrutiny of the Fed and unknowns about the shape and timing of Washington policy. "I actually think Trump and Yellen are on the same page. I think they want the same thing. 'Let the economy run hot and drag your feet raising rates.' I don't see a lot of controversy. The controversy could be around the independence of the Fed and [Sen.] Rand Paul wanting to audit the Fed," he said. There are also a few important economic reports in the week ahead, with CPI inflation data and retail sales Wednesday. There are some major earnings including PepsiCo, Cisco, Kraft Heinz and AIG. show chapters Yellen: Rates will creep higher, not rise dramatically    Wednesday, 18 Jan 2017 | 3:27 PM ET | 01:28 Trump, of course, will stay a top focus, as he has since before his first day in office. In the past week, he shook markets out of their doldrums by promising Thursday he would provide details on tax reform in the next two to three weeks. That launched a stock market rally that took major indexes to record highs, put a bid under the dollar and drove bond yields higher. It also turned the market focus back to the programs that helped propel stocks higher since the election — not the recent controversies around immigration, trade and his daughter's clothing line. "I think we'll just wait for the tax stuff to come out and we'll wait for other stuff. I still think the market could go up in the meantime. I think the equity market is now the new Nielsen ratings for Trump," said Ablin. "That's his barometer … between tweets and remarks." Trump meets with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday, after spending the weekend with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In the past week, Trump also made conciliatory comments to China's President Xi Jinping about the country's One China Policy regarding Taiwan. That reduced some market concern that Trump will steer the U.S. into a trade war with China. Key stock indexes in the past week all closed at record highs. The Dow gained 1 percent for the week, ending at 20,269. The S&P 500 was up 0.8 percent at 2,316, and the Nasdaq was at 5,734, up 1.2 percent for the week. The 10-year Treasury yield was fairly active during the week, at 2.40 percent Friday after touching a low of around 2.32 percent Wednesday. Gold futures for April, rallying most of the week, sold off in the final two U.S. sessions but ended up 1.2 percent at $1,235.90 per ounce. Oil bottomed hard mid-week on worries of oversupply but bounced back to end the week flat, with West Texas Intermediate futures for March at $53.86 per barrel. As for the Fed, the markets have been at odds with the Fed's forecast and its own expectations. Wall Street is skeptical the Fed can hike three times this year, and targets more like two rate hikes. "[Yellen's] always a market moving event, but I feel like basically there's no upside, there's no reason for her to come out and use this as an opportunity to launch the Fed's pace, or trajectory for the Fed's balance sheet. It's too early," said George Goncalves, head of rates strategy at Nomura. Fed officials, since their last meeting, have been talking about the day when they will stop holding onto the $4.5 trillion in Treasury and mortgage securities in their portfolio, and allow them to roll down. The Fed now replaces them, and if it were to cut back that would be the first step in the Fed reducing its balance sheet. It is not seen as something the Fed would do until possibly next year, but it has gotten the market's attention since the Fed signaled it was discussing it several months ago. There also has been a debate within the bond market over whether the Fed could signal that it could raise rates at its March meeting, seen as unlikely by most Fed watchers. Expectations for March were further dampened when the Fed gave no indication in its Feb. 1 statement that it was ready to move, and the weak wage growth in the January jobs report lessened expectations for inflation — and Fed rate hikes. show chapters Trump to fill three vacant Fed governor seats    12 Hours Ago | 02:44 Goncalves said Yellen would not want to be boxed in by pointing to any time frame for a hike, thought the markets expect a June move. "If the outlook is so rosy and so robust and they're feeling they are behind the curve, they could ramp up three hikes in the second half of the year. March is not going to be an insurance hike to start the process for 2017. You just don't do that to get the ball rolling. You do it when you have more confidence in the outlook … It's all about confidence. Not confidence around [Trump], just confidence about what's going to be delivered on the government side," he said. The Trump tax plan will also remain top of mind for markets, and there now is a wait-and-see on what he will propose — a similar plan to the House Republicans, which includes a border adjustment tax, or something else. The controversial border-adjustment tax would be a key way to pay for the corporate tax cut, which under Speaker Paul Ryan's plan would take the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. It basically taxes imports at a 20 percent rate but there would be no tax on exports. "There's just uneasiness in the senate over this. This is going to be a roller coaster ride," said Daniel Clifton, head of policy research at Strategas. The House plan proposes a one-time repatriation of the $2 trillion in corporate cash stashed overseas, full expensing of capital equipment and a limit on deductability of interest. But without the border adjusted tax, or destination tax, the plan would not carry a tax rate as low as 20 percent. Many S&P companies already have tax rates in the low 20s percent. Congress is lining up on both sides of the border-adjustment tax, and so are companies, with industrial companies like GE and Caterpillar in favor of it and retailers, like Target and Wal-Mart against it. "It's like 'Hunger Games' for tax lobbyists now," said Clifton. "If you're negatively impacted by the border tax, you're pushing the net interest deductibility." Limiting interest deductibility would be a negative for financial firms. Clifton said the market may not get what it's looking for in Trump's tax plan. "This is: They promise something big, but it's not meaty," Clifton said.

See Offers Business Posted February 10 Updated February 10 increase font size Amazon will add Arkansas to sales tax list Arkansas will be the latest state where Amazon has relented after years of resisting collecting sales taxes. By ANDREW DeMILLOAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Amazon said Friday that it will begin collecting sales taxes next month in Arkansas, which lawmakers say could generate as much as $100 million to help lift the state’s lagging revenue and potentially fund future income tax cuts. Arkansas will be the latest state where the e-commerce giant has relented after years of resisting efforts to collect taxes in states where it doesn’t have a physical presence. Amazon spokeswoman Jill Kerr said the company will begin collecting the sales tax on March 1, but declined to elaborate on the move. AT A GLANCE Amazon currently collects sales taxes in 38 states and the District of Columbia, according to the company’s website. Maine is not among them. Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → The decision, first reported by Little Rock television station KATV, comes days after Arkansas lawmakers advanced separate efforts to force Amazon to begin collecting sales taxes. A Senate-backed proposal would require Amazon and similar out-of-state companies to begin collecting sales taxes. A state House-backed measure would require Amazon and similar companies to tell Arkansas customers they owe the state sales tax and provide a list to finance officials of purchases made by state residents. The first sales taxes collected by Amazon will be paid to the state in April. State finance officials declined to comment on Amazon’s decision or the expected revenue from the move, citing a state law that bars them from commenting on the specific status of taxpayers. Republican state Sen. Jake Files, who proposed the Senate-backed bill, has estimated it could bring in between $32 million and $100 million a year. Files said his proposal is still needed to recover funds from other out-of-state companies. “I think it’s a good move for fairness, but it doesn’t complete the fairness circle,” Files said. Files’ measure is modeled after a 2016 law in South Dakota, where officials last month said Amazon agreed to begin collecting sales taxes. The state House bill is modeled after a Colorado law that the U.S. Supreme Court let stand last year. The proposals had the backing of Bentonville-based Wal-Mart, but faced opposition from conservative groups such as Americans for Tax Reform. To avoid collecting taxes, Amazon has historically relied on another high court ruling that predates the era of online shopping. That 1992 decision bans states from forcing out-of-state retailers to collect taxes if they don’t have a physical presence in the state. But the company has shifted recently, with Amazon this winter collecting sales taxes in at least 10 states where it hadn’t previously. Neighboring Oklahoma announced last week that Amazon would begin collecting sales taxes there starting next month. Amazon currently collects sales taxes in 38 states and the District of Columbia, according to the company’s website. Prior to Friday’s announcement, Amazon collected or was preparing to collect sales taxes in every state bordering Arkansas. The decision could raise hopes about Arkansas’ finances. Gov. Asa Hutchinson told several state agencies last week to prepare for possible budget cuts after finance officials said the state’s revenue was $57 million below forecast. Hutchinson, a Republican, repeated his desire Friday that any additional revenue from online sales go toward further cutting Arkansas’ income tax. Hutchinson last month signed into law a measure cutting the state’s income tax by $50 million and forming a task force to recommend further cuts before the 2019 legislative session. “This strengthened revenue stream will allow us to continue to make progress in cutting the income tax rate, making Arkansas more competitive with our surrounding states, and putting money back into the pockets of hardworking Arkansans,” he said in a statement.

(Wayne Newton photo) Tweet Change text size for the story Print Report an error People have funny reactions. When crack-smoking Rob Ford was mayor, tourists didn’t stop flocking to Toronto. When Rene Levesque became premier of Quebec with the goal of separation, there were no cries about boycotting La Belle Province. Cuba, under Fidel Castro, became one of the top winter destinations for Canadians. Yet with Donald Trump in the White House, social media comes alive with pleas to stop visiting the United States under the hashtag #boycottUSAtourism. The sentiment has reached famous levels, with noted author Linwood Barclay cancelling a book tour in Arizona. Still, no word on whether Justin Bieber, Neil Young, or Wayne Gretzky are moving home. My point is that’s it’s wrong to disengage and build a wall. It helps no one and solves nothing. As odious as we may find Trump, Canadians shouldn’t give up on the U.S. because they are angry or afraid of him. Would you give up on your daughter just because she’s dating a goof? “It’s worth stepping back and taking some deep breaths to get a better perspective on things,” a travel industry contact based in Florida wrote me in an email. “I suppose if Americans start leaving the U.S. as refugees, it will be time to be worried. But, as people elsewhere in the world say, Americans generally overstate things, both good and bad.” Perhaps few people have travelled in the U.S. as much as I have during the past five years, so much so that a border agent at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel recently questioned why. My destinations have not always been those which are top of mind with Canadians — no New York City, Florida and the like for me. Mine have been the heartland, the smaller cities and rural routes. It’s there where you’ll find a beautiful nation, populated by interesting, patriotic people who (insert big sigh here) voted for Trump. Visit places like Apostle Islands, Wis., hip North Little Rock, Ark., or Burnet County, Texas, and you’ll hear why. It starts with feeling ignored and I suspect ends with buyer’s remorse that he’s actually keeping his campaign promises. If you’re a tourist serious about understanding America, there are three surprising places you should go, none of which involve Disney castles, Hamilton, sand, or slot machines. • McAllen, Texas, on the Rio Grande River, which is about as Mexican-American a town as you can find. Its public library is a former Walmart. • Bentonville, Ark., where one of America’s best art galleries was created using the profits from one of its most controversial capitalist success stories. • Branson, Mo., where it’s God, military, and the Shoji Tabuchi show. That’s the America that Canadians should be seeing and engaging. It’s not the time to be staying home or cocooning in the usual destinations. “No matter what you read in the papers or hear on television, Americans are waiting to see but they’re not frightened,” my Florida friend writes. “There is no evidence that Trump is Hitler or even that he’s Nixon. It remains to be seen if he is merely a buffoon like Rob Ford or if, as he says, his public persona is simply a reflection of his style of doing business.” He continues: “Americans love Canadians. They like to go to Canada. They like Canadians to come to America. Of all the people in the world, even people from Britain and Australia and New Zealand, Canadians are most like us, and they make us feel comfortable. “But, we are different. For a while, the pendulum swung more in the direction of being more like Canadians. Now it’s swinging in the direction of being different. America has always done this: alternated between more or less conservative poles. And, we’re always caught in some crisis of deciding who we are.” That’s where we can help. Let’s pay grassroots America a visit and remind them who the world needs them to be. Now’s not the time to stay at home.

Home World news Donald Trump tax talk lifts Wall Street to record highs Donald Trump tax talk lifts Wall Street to record highs U.S. stocks hit record highs on Friday as investors cheered President Donald Trump's vow to unveil a major tax reform plan in the coming weeks. By: Reuters | Published: February 11, 2017 2:53 AM (Reuters) U.S. stocks hit record highs on Friday as investors cheered President Donald Trump’s vow to unveil a major tax reform plan in the coming weeks. Trump’s promise of a “phenomenal” tax plan helped reignite a post-election rally, which had stalled in recent weeks on concerns over his administrative priorities and the lack of clarity on policy reforms. “The market is saying, ‘Thank you for coming back to the very core of the reasons we have accepted your agenda’,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. The dollar index was up 0.3 percent to a three-week high of 101.01. Gold was down 0.3 percent. Oil prices rose 2 percent after reports that OPEC members delivered more than 90 percent of the output cuts they pledged in a landmark deal that took effect in January. The S&P 500 energy index was up 0.85 percent and gave the broader index its biggest boost. Industrial stocks, which have been among the top gainers in the post-election rally, also rose 0.6 percent. At 11:06 a.m. ET (1606 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 72.35 points, or 0.36 percent, at 20,244.75, the S&P 500 was up 5.19 points, or 0.22 percent, at 2,313.06 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 12.03 points, or 0.21 percent, at 5,727.21. Ten of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher. Consumer staples was the outlier, largely due to a 1.6 percent fall in Wal-Mart shares. The ongoing corporate earnings season helped buoy sentiment. Activision Blizzard surged 17 percent and gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500. The videogame maker reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and a $1 billion share buyback program. Skechers USA was up 22 percent after its fourth-quarter revenue beat expectations. Sears Holding jumped 31 percent to $7.27 after the struggling retailer said it would cut debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion this year.

(AP) — Amazon said Friday that it will begin collecting sales taxes next month in Arkansas, which lawmakers say could generate as much as $100 million to help lift the state's lagging revenue and potentially fund future income tax cuts. Arkansas will be the latest state where the e-commerce giant has relented after years of resisting effort to collect taxes in states where it doesn't have a physical presence. Amazon spokeswoman Jill Kerr said the company will begin collecting the sales tax on March 1, but declined to elaborate on the move. The decision, first reported by Little Rock television station KATV, comes days after Arkansas lawmakers advanced separate efforts to force Amazon to begin collecting sales taxes. A Senate-backed proposal would require Amazon and similar out-of-state companies to begin collecting sales taxes. A state House-backed measure would require Amazon and similar companies to tell Arkansas customers they owe the state sales tax and provide a list to finance officials of purchases made by state residents. The first sales taxes collected by Amazon will be paid to the state in April. State finance officials declined to comment on Amazon's decision or the expected revenue from the move, citing a state law that bars them from commenting on the specific status of taxpayers. Republican state Sen. Jake Files, who proposed the Senate-backed bill, has estimated it could bring in between $32 million and $100 million a year. Files said his proposal is still needed to recover funds from other out-of-state companies. "I think it's a good move for fairness, but it doesn't complete the fairness circle," Files said. Files' measure is modeled after a 2016 law in South Dakota, where officials last month said Amazon agreed to begin collecting sales taxes. The state House bill is modeled after a Colorado law that the U.S. Supreme Court let stand last year. The proposals had the backing of Bentonville-based Wal-Mart, but faced opposition from conservative groups such as Americans for Tax Reform. To avoid collecting taxes, Amazon has historically relied on another high court ruling that predates the era of online shopping. That 1992 decision bans states from forcing out-of-state retailers to collect taxes if they don't have a physical presence in the state. But the company has shifted recently, with Amazon this winter collecting sales taxes in at least 10 states where it hadn't previously. Neighboring Oklahoma announced last week that Amazon would begin collecting sales taxes there starting next month. Amazon currently collects sales taxes in 38 states and the District of Columbia, according to the company's website. Prior to Friday's announcement, Amazon collected or was preparing to collect sales taxes in every state bordering Arkansas. The decision could raise hopes about Arkansas' finances. Gov. Asa Hutchinson told several state agencies last week to prepare for possible budget cuts after finance officials said the state's revenue was $57 million below forecast. Hutchinson, a Republican, repeated his desire Friday that any additional revenue from online sales to go toward further cutting Arkansas' income tax. Hutchinson last month signed into law a measure cutting the state's income tax by $50 million and forming a task force to recommend further cuts before the 2019 legislative session. "This strengthened revenue stream will allow us to continue to make progress in cutting the income tax rate, making Arkansas more competitive with our surrounding states, and putting money back into the pockets of hardworking Arkansans," he said in a statement. ___ Follow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ademillo Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest Getty Images Dealing with zits on your face is one thing—but back acne (aka bacne) is another level of annoying. At least when you're wrestling with an angry blemish in your T-zone you can see what you're doing. Not so when pimples pop up on your back. It's hard enough just getting soap back there—applying zit cream between your shoulder blades is like a pulled muscle waiting to happen. And it might not work anyway, because the skin on your back doesn't respond as well to many of the acne treatments you use on your face. Here, dermatologists explain the difference between acne and bacne, and how to get acne off your back for good. Related: 4 Reasons You Have Big, Painful Pimples—and What to Do About It Though acne and bacne are caused by the same things, you need to treat them differently. "Acne is caused by increased oil production, bacteria, pore blockage, and irregular skin cell turnover," board-certified dermatologist Eric Meinhardt, M.D., tells SELF, and that goes for your face and your back. Sebaceous glands in the skin produce oil, which can collect along with dead skin cells in the pores, plugging them up and giving bacteria a perfect breeding ground, all of which can lead to redness, whiteheads, blackheads, and sometimes infection. Hormones can play a large role, which is why you might break out more around your period, for instance. And if you've noticed that your breakouts pop up in similar places as other family members, that could be acne's genetic components at work, Meinhardt says. While the root causes of zits are basically the same in both places, the skin on your face is very different from the skin on your back, which has its upsides and downsides. The skin on the face has more blood supply, Meinhardt says, which helps acne heal faster and reduces scarring. But the skin on the back is much thicker than the skin on the face (specifically the second layer, called the dermis). That means that the back is more resilient, and can handle stronger treatments, scrubs, and exfoliants that would be considered too harsh for the face. The ingredients doctors most commonly recommend for body acne are generally the same as what you'd use on your face, but the products themselves are usually stronger. "Salicylic acid is attracted to the oil in the sebaceous glands; and once there, it helps to loosen the sticky cells and oil to clear clogged hair follicles," Heidi Waldorf, M.D., the director of laser and cosmetic dermatology at the Mount Sinai Hospital, tells SELF. Benzoyl peroxide is a topical antibiotic that will work to kill bacteria and clean pores. Salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide products with concentrations over 2 percent can dry out the skin on the face. But since the skin on the back is a bit thicker and less sensitive, you can reach for formulas with higher percentages. (Meinhardt points out that any benzoyl peroxide above 5 percent is unnecessary; it's no more effective but causes more side effects.) Because bacne tends to cover a large swath of skin—and because it's harder to reach your back to apply spot treatments—many products will come in the form of body washes and face scrubs that you can put on in the shower. Meinhardt is a fan of the Neutrogena Clear Pore line to treat back acne. The cleanser has 3.5 percent benzoyl peroxide and the scrub has 3.7 percent. If you prefer a salicylic acid cleanser for your back, try Dial Acne Control Deep Cleansing Body Wash ($7; Walmart.com). Meinhardt recommends leaving these cleansers on for a few minutes before washing them off to give the products time to truly treat the acne. Related: The 8 Best Acne Products You Haven’t Tried Yet In addition to the usual suspects, board-certified dermatologist Debbie Palmer, D.O., recommends trying products with retinol, which helps loosen up dead skin cells and regulate cell turnover. “Retinoids not only treat the acne you have today, they also change the way the cells turn over, reducing your development of acne tomorrow,” Waldorf says. She likes Differin gel ($13; target.com), which used to require a prescription. (Retin-A, a form of vitamin A, still does.) "Differin can also be applied at the same time as a benzoyl peroxide, so you can get the anti-blockage and antibiotic effects," she adds. To make sure you don't miss a spot when applying topical creams and gels, Waldorf recommends using an applicator like the L'applique ($7; lapplique.com) to help you reach those hard-to-get-to areas. Sulfur is another lesser known ingredient that works by killing acne-causing bacteria. Reach for a cleanser with the active ingredient—like the Dermissa Sulfur Facial Bar ($3; walgreens.com)—rather than creams, many of which can have a rotten egg smell. Bacne scars can be worse than acne scars on the face. Pimples on the back are more likely to scar than those on the face. “The face will theoretically heal better because it has better skin cell turnover, more healing potential, and better blood supply,” Meinhardt says. What's more, she says, the back is more prone to getting keloids, which are raised, overgrown scars. Antioxidant-rich formulas are key to getting the redness left behind to fade quickly—and it's important to start treatment right away. "When scars have healed but are still red or pink, I recommend using topical antioxidants twice daily," Palmer says. That goes for the face and back. Her favorite antioxidant for bacne is vitamin C, and she recommends Replere Protect & Rejuvenate Day Lotion ($90; replere.com) to her patients. Remember to apply morning and night, and you'll be ready to rock that backless dress in no time. When it comes to prevention, here are some pro tips—and rookie mistakes to avoid. Just like on your face, there are bad habits that can lead to breakouts on your back. You wash your face when it gets dirty and sweaty, right? For the same reason, you'll want to change out of your sports bra soon after a workout, so that the sweaty clothing against your back doesn’t become a breeding ground for bacteria. In general wearing tight clothing with body-hugging fabrics can trap natural oils and shedding skin in pores, which can lead to breakouts. If you're prone to bacne, you might want to avoid tight fitting fabrics, and instead opt for breathable materials that wick moisture and keep your skin as dry as possible. Perhaps surprisingly, the way you wash your hair can have an impact on bacne. While the oils in hair treatments might be good for nourishing your strands, they can be bad news for the skin on your back. That's why Palmer says that you should rinse conditioner off to the side instead of letting it run down your back. Also, try waiting until you've completed all of your hair treatments before washing your body. That way you can wash off any oily residue, clearing the way for your acne treatments to do their thing.

Uber Technologies lost customers and drivers and became the subject of a campaign on Twitter that encouraged people to delete their Uber apps. The opposition compelled Uber chief executive officer Travis Kalanick to quit Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum. Meanwhile, Tesla faced relatively minimal backlash and no comparable boycott effort, and CEO Elon Musk said he has no plans to quit the committee. The contrast is viewed as a double standard within Uber's headquarters in San Francisco. In private conversations, senior management and investors have groused that Musk has emerged unscathed from his associations with a divisive president and his membership on the same business advisory group that Kalanick had to abandon, according to people involved in these discussions. "That's not representative of how we feel," said Jill Hazelbaker, a spokesperson for Uber. "No one working at Uber would want another company to experience what we have over the past few weeks." This wasn't the first time Uber watched jealously as Musk sidestepped the very same obstacles encountered by the ride-hailing giant. In December, Uber deployed a small fleet of self-driving cars in San Francisco without applying for an autonomous vehicle licence. When the California Department of Motor Vehicles came calling, Uber pointed to Tesla, saying it was only following the automaker's lead. "What we are doing today is just like Tesla," Anthony Levandowski, head of the company's Advanced Technologies Group overseeing self-driving cars and other projects, said at the time. Officials didn't agree. The DMV revoked Uber's car registrations, while Tesla drivers could continue letting their robotic cars guide them around town. Instead of filing the paperwork as more than 20 technology companies and carmakers have-including Tesla, which does so for the autonomous system it's testing but not for cars with Autopilot-Uber relocated its vehicles to Arizona. Each company is shaped by the outsize reputation of its founding leader. Whereas Kalanick is seen as a pugnacious Ayn Rand fan who champions free markets, Musk is a whiz bringing rocket ships, electric cars, traffic-busting tunnels, solar energy and other futuristic goodies to humanity. "Elon Musk absolutely has created the Tesla brand very much based on his personal brand," said Daniel Binns, managing director at Omnicom Group-owned consulting firm Interbrand. "There's a huge amount of positive goodwill for the brand, and therefore, if there was any sense of negativity, they'd be able to deal with it." The Tesla brand — and by extension, Musk's — represents "a noble ambition: The vision is to make the world more sustainable by providing renewable energy sources, cars and battery sources," Binns said. "Uber doesn't have that. It's not known for being a mission-driven organization." Tesla declined to comment. Uber's Hazelbaker said, "We know we've made mistakes in the past, and we are working hard to serve riders, drivers and cities around the world." Of course, it's a lot easier for people to demonstrate their dismay with Uber. They can delete an account and switch to a competing app. Drivers can change allegiances to U.S. rival Lyft and get a $1,000 (all figures U.S.) sign-up bonus to boot. Lyft ran a national ad campaign to capitalize on this conception of Uber as cold and uncaring. Lyft's darling status among liberals is another source of consternation for the Uber camp, people familiar with the situation said. That's because Lyft's board includes representatives of funds founded by two Trump allies, Peter Thiel and Carl Icahn. Unlike with Uber, it's tougher to dump a $70,000 all-electric, partially autonomous car with few peers on the road. "Uber is a household name," said Bradley Tusk, an Uber adviser and former mayoral campaign manager for Michael Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP. "People interact with it every day, so it is just more familiar to them. Tesla is a great car, but the number of people who interact with Tesla in their daily lives is infinitesimal. They're not analogous." Still, Americans weren't boycotting such ubiquitous American brands as Pepsi or Walmart, whose chiefs also sit on the council. Uber's early scandals shaped the company's image in the minds of many people. It's haunted by such events as the use of surge pricing during hurricane Sandy and other emergencies, as well as its deployment of underhanded tactics against competitors that backfired. Even today, it's engaged in lawsuits contending that it takes advantage of drivers by not giving them employment benefits or allowing unions. Last week's Trump ordeal traces its roots to one of the earliest sources of controversy for the company: surge pricing. This time, people were upset that Uber turned it off. On Jan. 28, Uber posted a tweet saying it was suspending fare increases at a New York City airport shortly after cabbies protesting Trump's immigration ban were set to disperse. Uber had wanted to avoid giving the impression of profiteering from a protest, but instead, it was labelled a scab for purportedly trying to break the strike. The outrage was fuelled by Kalanick's perceived friendliness toward the Trump administration, thanks to the advisory council and a soft statement he put out after the president signed an executive order targeting immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries.

(AP) — Amazon said Friday that it will begin collecting sales taxes next month in Arkansas, which lawmakers say could generate as much as $100 million to help lift the state's lagging revenue and potentially fund future income tax cuts. Arkansas will be the latest state where the e-commerce giant has relented after years of resisting effort to collect taxes in states where it doesn't have a physical presence. Amazon spokeswoman Jill Kerr said the company will begin collecting the sales tax on March 1, but declined to elaborate on the move. The decision, first reported by Little Rock television station KATV, comes days after Arkansas lawmakers advanced separate efforts to force Amazon to begin collecting sales taxes. A Senate-backed proposal would require Amazon and similar out-of-state companies to begin collecting sales taxes. A state House-backed measure would require Amazon and similar companies to tell Arkansas customers they owe the state sales tax and provide a list to finance officials of purchases made by state residents. The first sales taxes collected by Amazon will be paid to the state in April. State finance officials declined to comment on Amazon's decision or the expected revenue from the move, citing a state law that bars them from commenting on the specific status of taxpayers. Republican state Sen. Jake Files, who proposed the Senate-backed bill, has estimated it could bring in between $32 million and $100 million a year. Files said his proposal is still needed to recover funds from other out-of-state companies. "I think it's a good move for fairness, but it doesn't complete the fairness circle," Files said. Files' measure is modeled after a 2016 law in South Dakota, where officials last month said Amazon agreed to begin collecting sales taxes. The state House bill is modeled after a Colorado law that the U.S. Supreme Court let stand last year. The proposals had the backing of Bentonville-based Wal-Mart, but faced opposition from conservative groups such as Americans for Tax Reform. To avoid collecting taxes, Amazon has historically relied on another high court ruling that predates the era of online shopping. That 1992 decision bans states from forcing out-of-state retailers to collect taxes if they don't have a physical presence in the state. But the company has shifted recently, with Amazon this winter collecting sales taxes in at least 10 states where it hadn't previously.

Amazon currently collects sales taxes in 38 states and the District of Columbia, according to the company's website. Prior to Friday's announcement, Amazon collected or was preparing to collect sales taxes in every state bordering Arkansas. The decision could raise hopes about Arkansas' finances. Gov. Asa Hutchinson told several state agencies last week to prepare for possible budget cuts after finance officials said the state's revenue was $57 million below forecast. Hutchinson, a Republican, repeated his desire Friday that any additional revenue from online sales to go toward further cutting Arkansas' income tax. Hutchinson last month signed into law a measure cutting the state's income tax by $50 million and forming a task force to recommend further cuts before the 2019 legislative session. "This strengthened revenue stream will allow us to continue to make progress in cutting the income tax rate, making Arkansas more competitive with our surrounding states, and putting money back into the pockets of hardworking Arkansans," he said in a statement. ___ Follow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ademillo Tags Wire Business General News State Taxes Government Taxation And Revenue Government Finance Government Business And Finance Government And Politics State Governments Sales Taxes State Legislature Legislature × Post a comment Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

Gerald Herbert/AP hide caption toggle caption Gerald Herbert/AP On Tuesday, a tornado tore through New Orleans East, causing destruction to a neighborhood hit hard by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Gerald Herbert/AP In New Orleans, hundreds of families are trying to put their lives back together after a tornado touched down in New Orleans East on Tuesday. It tore up homes and businesses in a predominantly black neighborhood that was hit hard by Hurricane Katrina. People like Aretha Conley are hoping it will be easier to rebuild this time around. Conley and her husband saved for years to buy their house on Read Boulevard. They each worked two jobs and took out loans. Hurricane Katrina: 10 Years Of Recovery And Reflection Aug. 30, 2015 Conley's favorite place in her small, single-story home is the backyard. "I love to barbecue," she says. "I love to give parties." But now, her backyard is decimated. Tuesday's tornado smashed down her fence, and pieces of her neighbor's house are stuck in a tree. Half of her roof is gone, and the windows are busted out. She's just thankful no one died. As cleanup workers drive loaders through the street, scooping up debris and fallen trees, Conley takes stock of the damage. "Got up Tuesday, bring my granddaughter to school, going to work, thinking everything's going to be OK," she says. "And come home to this." Article continues after sponsorship When Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, Conley's house took four feet of water. But she and her husband fixed it up and stayed put. They loved the neighborhood. There are a lot of people like her here; it's about 95 percent black. The Two-Way After Tornadoes Hit In And Around New Orleans, Wall Of Storms Moves East And that's something State Sen. Wesley Bishop is proud of. He was at an emergency shelter where victims were sleeping on cots and picking up hot meals, water and cleaning supplies. "Basically our black middle-class, you'll find a lot of folks concentrated in New Orleans East," he says. "Mostly homeowners and things along those lines, who've just worked extremely hard." But life changed after Hurricane Katrina. Many people moved away and never returned. And many businesses in this part of town never reopened. That makes life difficult for people like Conley. "Like, the weekend when I want to go out to eat — me and my husband — we have to travel so far to go to eat because there's nothing out here," she says. There's a Wal-Mart and some strip malls but not much else. And Bishop resents that. "People shouldn't have to go outside of this area to try to get the basic goods and services that they need," he says. The Two-Way Tornado Outbreaks Are On The Rise, And Scientists Don't Know Why He's worried after this recent tornado because he says his district didn't get enough help from the government following Katrina. They got a few nice things, like help rebuilding schools and a big, beautiful sports and recreation facility. But the facility has been put to use as an emergency relief center, overflowing now with displaced families. Conley is staying with her daughter for now. They're hoping it will be declared a federal disaster. "I hope it's better this time," Conley said. "I hope it's real better." And she hopes this time, it's different. This time, she hopes New Orleans East gets the long-term help it needs. tornado New Orleans Hurricane Katrina Facebook Twitter Google+ Email NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor Homepage News U.S. World Politics Business Technology Science Health Race & Culture Education Arts & Life Books Movies Pop Culture Food Art & Design Performing Arts Photography Music First Listen Songs We Love Music Articles Tiny Desk Videos Programs About NPR Overview NPR Finances People at NPR Support NPR Visit NPR Press Room NPR Extra Blog Careers at NPR Corrections NPR Ombudsman Permissions Help Contact Terms of Use Privacy Sponsorship Choices Text-Only

Hawaii may be breaking law by allowing foreign men to fish Associated Press | 0 comments HONOLULU (AP) — Hawaii authorities may have been violating their own state law for years by issuing commercial fishing licenses to thousands of foreign workers who were refused entry into the country, The Associated Press has found. About 700 of these men are currently confined to vessels in Honolulu without visas, some making less than $1 an hour. They work without most basic labor protections just a few miles from Waikiki's white sand beaches, catching premium tuna and swordfish sold at some of America's most upscale grocery stores, hotels and restaurants. The AP found that under state law, these workers — who make up most of the crew in a fleet catching $110 million worth of seafood annually — may not be allowed to fish at all. A recent industry-sponsored assessment of crew members' treatment and living conditions found no human trafficking, but raised concerns that workers could be vulnerable to exploitation and said they have little recourse about paying fees or incurring debt in order to hold their jobs. "There exists no system of grievance mechanisms for crew to voice concerns over pay," according to the report. In this unique fishing arrangement facilitated by both federal and state officials, Hawaii's boat owners pay brokers up to $10,000 to bring each crew member from impoverished Southeast Asian and Pacific island nations. The men aren't allowed to arrive at Honolulu's airport because they lack visas, so they are instead flown to other countries and put on U.S.-owned fishing boats for long sails back to Hawaii. Before the men start working, they need a state commercial fishing license. In order to get it, Hawaii requires that they must be "lawfully admitted" to the U.S. Here's the hitch: When they arrive, they are met at the dock by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents who ban them from entering the country by stamping "refused" on their landing permits, which voids them. So instead of being "lawfully admitted," they are now barred by law from setting foot on U.S. soil. "Try taking a check to your bank that says 'void' on it and telling them, 'Oh, but they wrote the check to me,'" said Hawaii attorney Lance Collins, who advocates for the workers. Nonetheless, a written opinion by Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said the Department of Land and Natural Resources provides the landing permits as proof the fishermen are "lawfully admitted." U.S. Customs sees it differently. "NO. They cannot be admitted," spokesman Frank Falcon wrote in an email, adding that the stamp means they can't even enter the U.S. temporarily. In rare cases, including medical emergencies, Customs can parole the men to go ashore. Foreign crews on boats and aircraft, including cruise ship workers and flight attendants, fill out landing permits when they arrive in the U.S. Customs takes those applications and decides whether to allow each individual to temporarily enter the country. When landing permits are stamped refused, that serves as proof that authorities have been alerted that foreigners without visas are on arriving vessels or planes, and triggers an order for captains to detain them on board. Chin's office did not respond to AP's queries about the refusal stamp. However, Land and Natural Resources department spokesman Dan Dennison said in an email that the attorney general advised his agency to continue issuing fishing licenses to the foreign workers despite the fact that Customs says the men are not "lawfully admitted." The Hawaii Longline Association, which represents boat owners, says the men are legally hired for legitimate work on the fleet's 141 active vessels. And while the conditions and pay are often below U.S. standards, the jobs are typically better than the bleak opportunities the men have at home, mostly in the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia and the tiny Pacific island of Kiribati. Under federal law, U.S. citizens must make up 75 percent of the crew on most American commercial fishing boats. An AP investigation last year revealed Hawaii's fleet relies on a federal loophole allowing the foreign fishermen to work. In a hearing prompted by the AP report, Land and Natural Resources department administrator Bruce Anderson was asked why he issues commercial fishing licenses to foreign workers who can't enter the state. He said the crewman's landing permit "says in essence that the individual has the right to fish in U.S. waters but cannot step ashore." He did not mention that all the permits were stamped "refused." Democratic state Rep. Kaniela Ing, chairman of the Ocean, Marine Resources and Hawaiian Affairs committee, has queried Chin and other state officials at length about why the men cannot leave their boats. Ing said state officials failed to disclose the refusal stamp to him when he asked to see the landing permits. "It always seemed paradoxical that the proof of lawful entry was a landing form, but the crew members weren't allowed to land or leave the boat," he said, after the AP told him about the stamp. "We just didn't have the smoking gun evidence to point to why, and now we do." Critics say the fishing licenses could be just one of several ways the state is breaking its own laws: —The lowest-paid fishermen have contracts promising $300 a month, well below the state's wage minimums. The Labor Department says it doesn't intervene because the workers fall under federal, not state, jurisdiction. But department head Linda Chu Takayama also said she's awaiting further legal guidance. — Chin, the attorney general, said in his written opinion that employers in Hawaii typically cannot withhold wages, but some fishermen told the AP they are paid only after returning home when their one- or two-year contracts end. — Chin said telling consumers "that fish had been caught by local fishermen" may violate the state's deceptive practice laws if misinformation likely affects their shopping choices. The Hawaii Seafood Council claims the catch is "produced by Hawaii's hard-working fishermen." Council Program Manager John Kaneko did not respond to the AP. Federal law also is in question: U.S. Customs requires captains to detain the men on board and hold their passports because they are banned from entering the country. That potentially goes against U.S. human-trafficking laws saying bosses who possess workers' identification documents can face up to five years in prison. The foreign fishermen's catch is sold everywhere from Costco to Sam's Club and upscale restaurants across the U.S., including Trump International Hotel Waikiki. Whole Foods announced it would suspend buying seafood from the fleet after the AP's initial report, while Costco says it is monitoring the situation. The Trump hotel and Wal-Mart, which owns Sam's Club, did not provide an immediate response. The story also exposed dangerous, unsanitary conditions and at least two instances of human trafficking. It prompted new commitments from boat owners to protect the crew members' welfare. After a follow-up briefing on Capitol Hill, several members of Congress expressed "grave concerns" about working conditions in a letter to the Coast Guard and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Hawaii Seafood Council's survey of 207 fishermen identified a series of potential problems, particularly involving recruiting and payment of the foreign crew. Some fishermen had contracts requiring that part of their salaries or identification papers be withheld until they returned home. Others had signed agreements that said they had to pay for replacement workers if they broke their contracts, or faced $5,000 fines for absconding — equivalent to a year's salary for some. However, the assessment also found some fishermen had excellent relationships with their captains. All said they were being paid in cash, and none expressed concerns about forced labor or human trafficking. No one complained about access to food, but the report described one labor agent as saying that she had men on a boat who had not been paid for two months and that she bought groceries for fishermen at times when their boats ran out. The industry has implemented a new universal crew contract that requires owners to pay all recruiting fees and gives the fishermen their salaries within four days of landing. A draft Code of Conduct seeks to safeguard workers' rights. But there are no wage minimums as initially promised by Hawaii Longline Association president Sean Martin. The Honolulu Fish Auction now does business only with boats whose workers have signed those agreements. Martin declined to be interviewed, but he and other industry leaders have condemned labor abuses. They have said the workers are happy to have the jobs and typically do not complain, with many renewing their contracts and even recruiting relatives. Still, little has changed, with foreign crews typically spending three weeks a month at sea, working up to 20 hours a day, usually for far less than American fishermen nationwide, who average $2,500 a month. Their situation has been widely accepted as legal. The AP investigation is part of an ongoing global look at labor abuses in the fishing industry, stretching from Southeast Asia to America's own waters. In 2015, the AP reported on fishermen locked in a cage and others buried under fake names on the remote Indonesian island village of Benjina. Their catch was traced to the United States, leading to more than 2,000 slaves being freed. But thousands more remain trapped worldwide in a murky industry where work takes place far from shore and often without oversight. In Hawaii, most vessels dock at piers 17 and 38, which are guarded and patrolled, but some go as far as the West Coast. And, although technically not allowed, they do venture onto the piers briefly to socialize and use restrooms. Last year, Customs said six fishermen were deported after wandering away from their boats in Honolulu, some to visit friends on other vessels, others sneaking away for a drink. In 2010, two Indonesian fishermen who fled their boat in San Francisco alleging abuse were granted visas as victims of human trafficking and are now suing their former boat owner. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice said agents checking out a number of leads related to possible human trafficking in the fleet have "identified instances where crew members were contending with less than ideal working conditions," but found no situations meeting the legal threshold to bring criminal charges. Federal marine observers, who live with the men for weeks at a time at sea, said some fishermen have good working conditions while others are sometimes mistreated, not given proper health care, provided unclean drinking water and fed bait and rice. Many are forced to use buckets as toilets on board. Others in the community also have concerns. Uli Kozak, an Indonesian language professor at the University of Hawaii who has long exchanged home-cooked meals for fresh fish, said the workers sometimes ask for vegetables because of shortages on board. He said some captains have banned men from speaking their native language on boats. There's "a lot of verbal abuse, even physical abuse, being slapped in the face," Kozak said. "I have come across cases where people said, 'If I had ever known that it would be as bad as this, I would have never taken that job.'" ___ Follow Martha Mendoza and Margie Mason on Twitter at @mendozamartha and @MargieMasonAP © 2017 The Associated Press.

Quotes in the article Exxon Mobil Corp XOM ▲ 82.52 +0.68 +0.83% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 68.02 -1.06 -1.53% AdChoices When the limousine he shared with James Baker—former secretary of state, Treasury, and two-time presidential chief of staff—pulled up to the White House on Wednesday, an access issue for the driver halted them at the gate. Baker’s party, which included Ronald Reagan’s top economist Martin Feldstein, had to walk up the driveway. A spelling error in Feldstein’s name held them up again at two more checkpoints.  But for Halstead, this was the only hiccup in an otherwise successful enterprise. With help from Baker, Feldstein, and other figures from the Republican Party establishment, he staged what may be the biggest day for climate policy since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015. Their much publicized meeting with Gary Cohn, President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, helped introduce the Climate Leadership Council to a broader audience, and perhaps open a pathway to addressing global warming without compromising the party’s core beliefs. Trump campaigned in part on rolling back environmental policies put in place by President Barack Obama, having claimed that climate change is a hoax and argued that emission rules are onerous for business. But other opponents of climate regulation have pivoted of late, acknowledging the existence of global warming—if not the role humans play driving it—and thus providing someone like Halstead a way in with something called the carbon tax.  His tax isn’t really a tax, not in the conventional sense. The receipts wouldn’t flow to the Treasury. They would go into a program administered by the Social Security Administration, paying equal “dividends” back to taxpayers. For all but the richest 30 percent, the money would more than make up for increased energy prices, according to projections. And the bait for skeptics is that the government doesn’t keep a penny. Even with Halstead’s support among 20th century Republican power brokers, it’s the 21st century kind that need to sign off. Anticipation lingers over how Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt may oversee the Environmental Protection Agency after his expected confirmation as administrator. The EPA became Obama’s main outlet for cutting pollution once legislation died in 2010. Tea-leaf readers see Pruitt eliminating power-plant rules that are the centerpiece of Obama’s work on the issue. But under Halstead’s proposal, that wouldn’t really matter. His plan would reduce emissions twice as much as Obama-era regulations, say two analysts who helped Exxon Mobil Corp. and the Sierra Club see eye to eye on a carbon tax back in 2009. Consumers would be weened off fossil fuel consumption, given the increased expense. In the end, laws mandating pollution cuts could be eliminated anyway, since the market would take hold—or so the theory goes. This is Halstead’s plan, hailed in media reports this week as a potential third way in this existential debate. But his strategy is by no means new—it’s been two decades in the making.  Social entrepreneur Halstead, 48, calls himself a “social entrepreneur.” His first shop, Redefining Progress, opened its doors in the mid-1990s. It was an attempt by its 25-year-old founder to bring environmental analysis into economics. It developed an alternative GDP measure that incorporates environmental and social measures, called the “Genuine Progress Indicator.” The idea landed Halstead on the cover of the Atlantic and turned him into an overnight think-tank wunderkind. His group also started investigating how shifting taxation to natural resources would encourage conservation and lower tax burdens on business, the ancestor of the current carbon tax proposal.  By 1997, global climate change negotiations were coming to a head in Japan. Halstead spearheaded a statement by 2,500 economists acknowledging global warming is real, that it’s man-made, and that market-based policies are the best angle of attack. The Kyoto Protocol was never ratified by the U.S., helping convince Halstead that “the world was not ready for market-based climate policies.” At that point, he went off to graduate school at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. In 1999 he created the New America Foundation, a center-left think tank, and ran it for 10 years. Then he spent five years sailing around the world with his wife. By 2015, Halstead found his attention drawn again to climate change. The market was still largely unwilling to put a price on the present and future damage done by pollution. For years, more organizations were spending more money but the work wasn’t approaching goals suggested by scientists. “It just didn’t add up,” he said in an interview this week with Bloomberg. His Genuine Progress Indicator showed “there’s a fundamental disconnect between how we measure the economy and the real state of the economy,” he said. The market failed to account for what are called “externalities,” problems that companies create, have no incentive to solve, and push out to society at large.  “If you had to point to a single underlying cause of the climate problem, that is it,” he said. Carbon dioxide imposes costs on society, and yet pumping it into the atmosphere is free. “All price signals are wrong.” If climate change is to be slowed, he said, this would need to be rectified. Thank Canada—for your dividend Halstead dived back in to refine his arguments, penning a new essay in the Atlantic analyzing what became a key precedent for the Climate Leadership Council’s work: British Columbia’s revenue-neutral carbon tax. That experiment showed how the basic scheme works—emissions went down as the economy grew. To continue working, the carbon price had to rise regularly—the program lost steam when it didn’t. Halstead then added an idea he’d worked on two decades earlier, the notion of cutting checks to taxpayers—the “dividend.” From there, it was easy to identify the optimal vessel for his ideas. “The road to success on this runs through the Republican Party,” he said. In May, Halstead flew to California to meet with former Secretary of State George Shultz and Sequoia Capital Ltd. venture capitalist Thomas Stephenson. Both men are affiliated with an energy policy center at Stanford University and were active in clean energy and climate issues. Halstead described his strategy—to build a League of Extraordinary Gentlemen for climate policy—helping usher Republicans in Washington into the modern, warming world. Shultz, with Halstead, wrote letters to likely candidates, inviting them to help build the Climate Leadership Council. Joining up were former Treasury Secretary and ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chairman Henry Paulson and Harvard University economist and former Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Greg Mankiw. Both have supported a carbon tax in principle, and were persuaded to narrow their focus to Halstead’s tax-and-dividend policy. Rob Walton, a former Wal-Mart Stores Inc. chairman and current head of the executive committee of Conservation International, also signed on. Before long, Halstead flew to Houston to meet Baker.  Republican leadership Baker, 86, has never made climate change one of his central issues. But he recognized Shultz’s logic when the two spoke last year and Shultz argued for Republican leadership on the issue. Baker’s instincts became clear at the White House meeting. Once the visitors made it through White House security, he guided them to the Roosevelt Room, just across from the Oval Office, and waited.  “My temptation was ‘OK, while we’re waiting for them, let’s sit,’ ” Halstead said. “And Baker—in something like this you want to follow Baker’s lead—Baker said, ‘I’m going to stand until they get here.’ ” So they stood. Once Cohn arrived, Baker started right in. “They really understood the policy,” Halstead said of Trump’s aides, without getting into details. “They gave some favorable comments about it. We were quite pleased.” The White House didn’t return a request for comment. That meeting may be the opening lines of a new chapter in Halstead’s 20-year carbon tax odyssey. “In a very short amount of time, we’ve taken our solution and made it the default conservative climate plan, if and when the administration and Congress want to move forward,” he said. But he’s also realistic, and recognizes there are powerful forces vehemently opposed to any new taxes. One of them is Grover Norquist. In 1985 he founded Americans for Tax Reform, in part at the bidding of then President Reagan. The group has devoted itself to limiting taxes and regulations ever since. Norquist belittled Halstead’s initiative for having to tap Reagan-era officials to help sell the program. “They really had to go back that far?” he said. “How on earth does he say that Baker, Shultz, Mankiw, Feldstein, and Paulson are ‘the Left’?” Halstead said. “This is not creating a tax. This is a dividend back to the American people.” But Norquist isn’t alone: At a weekly lunch Norquist holds, Representative Peter Roskam, an Illinois Republican who chairs the House Ways and Means tax policy subcommittee, said of the climate council plan’s viability: “Absolutely not. Not even a topic of conversation.” Against such strident opposition, Halstead remains sanguine. By the end of the White House visit, Baker's driver had finally made it through security to pick them up. And by the spring Halstead expects the council will be able to announce a complete group of 20 founding members. Halstead holds close what motivates his pursuit of a carbon tax in the first place. “Having children really just changes your outlook on life,” he explained. “You think of their future. So the simplest example of that is on climate change.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem. Please try again.

What They Got: A new rear deck and kitchen counters are among the most recent updates to this 28-year-old house. The space plan comprises formal living and dining rooms, as well as an open breakfast area and a sunken family room. There are four upper bedrooms, including one with a walk-in closet and one of four bathrooms. There’s another lower-level guest room off the recreation area. Handy features include a main floor laundry room, central vacuum system and lawn sprinklers for the 60- by 111-foot lot. The Agent’s Take: “[Medicine Hat]’s a city with a very small town, community feel to it,” says agent Justin Taupert. This house is in the city’s south end, “which is a desired area because that’s where all the activity is with malls, a Wal-mart and other sorts of businesses.” Cosmetic changes also helped sell the 2,251-square-foot house. “The previous owners, when they bought it, completely redid everything on the interior,” Mr. Taupert notes. “[Otherwise], it’s a fairly typical two-storey for the year it was built.” Report Typo/Error Follow us on Twitter: @globeandmail Also on The Globe and Mail Done Deals: This unit with views of Lake Ontario sold for more than $80,000 over asking (The Globe and Mail)   More Related to this Story Competition drives Oakridge home price cut The business case for heritage building preservation Insurance claim ‘chaos’ slows Fort McMurray rebuild Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print In the know Globe Investor The path now to great stock returns?

(Vargas al día). EspañolThe Mexican people’s relationship with Donald Trump was bad to start, but it looks like it’s only getting worse. A survey taken by the newspaper El Universal asked Mexicans what they thought about their country’s relationship with the United States and its new president. In November, a few days before Donald Trump was elected President of the United States, 76 percent of Mexicans said that they had a bad/very bad opinion about him. But just three weeks into Trump’s term, and that percentage has increased to 86 percent. Sixty-four percent of Mexicans said they agree with the decision for President Trump to cancel a meeting with President Enrique Peña Nieto, but 20 percent disagree. Read More: Mexican President Denies Approaching Trump to Renegotiate NAFTA Read More: Business Leaders to Trump: Canning NAFTA Could Kill 6 Million US Jobs As for negotiations regarding Donald Trump and creating unity between the two countries, 55 percent of Mexicans said they believe that opposition parties should support Peña Nieto and 36 percent said they should only put conditions on the table that absolutely that support them. On the other hand, 44 percent said that out of all of Donald Trump’s threats and actions, the one that most people remember is the border wall, while 11 percent referred to the deportation of Mexicans and 7 percent to punishment of undocumented immigrants. While six out of 10 respondents think that the border wall will be built, 34 percent said they do not believe it will be built and six percent said that they don’t know.   Regarding the financing of the border wall, among the 54 percent who do believe that it will be built said that Mexico will pay and 40 percent said the United States will pay. Of those that do not believe it will be built, 68 percent of them believe that building what they consider is a “hypothetical border wall” will be paid for by Americans and 28 percent believe Mexico will pay for it. In relation to the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), 61 percent of those surveyed expressed support for Mexico remaining in the trade agreement and 31 percent want their country to abandon it.

His victory in pivotal Rust Belt states cemented his status as a champion of the Reagan Democrats, blue-collar, union-affiliated, working class voters; a demographic normally inclined to vote for the Democrats for economic reasons, but who are open to the seduction by the siren songs of economic populism and nationalism. Reagan blew Jimmy Carter (1980) and Walter Mondale (1984) away by appealing to this much-romanticized and long-downtrodden demographic. Trump shrewdly targeted large parts of his campaign message and strategy towards such voters, with demonstrable, even shocking, success. Trump won an estimated 42% of union voters: unions are typically one of the most reliably liberal voting blogs. If Trump wins nearly half of union voters, the Democrats are in trouble. Read More: Mexican President Denies Approaching Trump to Renegotiate NAFTA Read More: Business Leaders to Trump: Canning NAFTA Could Kill 6 Million US Jobs How did Trump do this? To begin with, blue collar unionized voters are terrified of having their jobs shipped overseas. Last year when the Carrier air conditioning and furnace plant in Indiana announced that it would be relocating manufacturing to Monterrey, Mexico, in a bid to save USD $65 million a year, Trump, in full campaign swing, went on the warpath, using Carrier as a national punching bag to demonstrate the evils of globalization and free trade agreements. It is undeniable that for the hundreds of northeastern Indiana workers who were about to lose their jobs, many of them represented by the United Steelworkers union, this was catastrophic. Yet, Trump fundamentally fails to view the far more important piece of this equation. For the 320 million Americans who do not work at the Carrier plants, they are going to be paying far less for their heating and air conditioning, thanks to Mexico's lower labor costs. Every time that the free trade argument comes up, special interest groups in the United States fight tooth and nail to protect their interests. But this is not beneficial for our democracy or for our economy. National economies should compete in their areas of strength. If Mexico is a more cost effective place to manufacture heating and air conditioning equipment, it should be manufactured in Mexico. Unfortunately for all Americans, our political system often thrives on putting the interests of special interest groups over the interests of all Americans. It is easy to see the hurt and the pain and the anger at an Indiana manufacturing plant where hundreds of blue-collar workers are informed that Mexicans are about to take their jobs. That makes for a great cut for the 6 o'clock news, or a soundbite for local radio, or even stump speech material for a presidential candidate. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1459522593195-0'); }); It is much harder to palpably sense the benefit felt by all Americans, of paying less (most likely considerably less) for their heating and air conditioning: items that virtually every American household needs and uses on a regular basis. It is hard to imagine, for example, a CNN reporter doing a story on outraged Americans forced to pay 20% more for their air conditioner because Carrier did not take advantage of cheaper Mexican labor costs. I can picture it now: Anderson Cooper shows up at a local Walmart to interview an outraged consumer: "This air conditioner costs $149.99, but it would have cost only $119.99 if Carrier had relocated those jobs to Mexico. I am outraged that those Carrier executives didn't ship those manufacturing facilities to Monterrey where labor costs are lower!" Right...we will never see this story. To the local politician, union organizer, community activist, informed voter, it is very easy to hype isolated examples of the detriments of globalization. Yet, few champion the benefits that all Americans, indeed all the world, have experienced as a result of the free trade that lubricates the engine of the global economy. When it comes to Mexico, Trump must understand that it is vital to the interests of the United States to have a prosperous, stable, and productive southern neighbor. Free trade agreements are hardly the enemy of the American worker. Even if you buy into the economic populism that seems to have taken the nation by storm, a recent study showed that during the 23 years of NAFTA's existence, only 600,000 jobs were "lost" to Mexico. As numerous economists have noted, the real manufacturing job killer is not Mexico, but the micro-chip, which has automated much assembly line work in recent decades. A war is likely to rage in the coming months within the Trump administration. A war between those who adhere to the traditional classical liberal and/or libertarian economic outlook, and those who have been seduced by the seductive siren song of economic populism and nationalism. Let's hope that Trump, who has a degree from the Wharton School of Business, will ditch the foolish populism that seemed to captivate him during the campaign trail, and look at the bigger picture. Free trade is good for America. It is good for Canada. And it is good for Mexico. Competition is at the very foundation of free trade in the context of a global economy. And that should be a persuasive argument for "the world's most competitive businessman."   Weekly E-Newsletter Get the latest from PanAm Post direct to your inbox!

Trump's promise of a "phenomenal" tax plan helped reignite a post-election rally, which had stalled in recent weeks on concerns over his administrative priorities and the lack of clarity on policy reforms. "The market is saying, 'Thank you for coming back to the very core of the reasons we have accepted your agenda'," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. The dollar index was up 0.3 percent to a three-week high of 101.01. Gold was down 0.3 percent. Oil prices rose 2 percent after reports that OPEC members delivered more than 90 percent of the output cuts they pledged in a landmark deal that took effect in January. The S&P 500 energy index was up 0.85 percent and gave the broader index its biggest boost. Industrial stocks, which have been among the top gainers in the post-election rally, also rose 0.6 percent. At 11:06 a.m. ET (1606 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 72.35 points, or 0.36 percent, at 20,244.75, the S&P 500 was up 5.19 points, or 0.22 percent, at 2,313.06 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 12.03 points, or 0.21 percent, at 5,727.21. Ten of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher. Consumer staples was the outlier, largely due to a 1.6 percent fall in Wal-Mart shares. The ongoing corporate earnings season helped buoy sentiment. Activision Blizzard surged 17 percent and gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500. The videogame maker reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and a $1 billion share buyback program. Skechers USA was up 22 percent after its fourth-quarter revenue beat expectations. Sears Holding jumped 31 percent to $7.27 after the struggling retailer said it would cut debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion this year. Mead Johnson was up 4.7 percent after Reckitt Benckiser finalised a $16.6 billion deal to buy the infant formula maker. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,895 to 891. On the Nasdaq, 1,629 issues rose and 1,011 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 39 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 106 new highs and 14 new lows.

Tracy Morgan stars in 'Fist Fight.'  (Photo: Bob Mahoney) It's a good thing Tracy Morgan is a lover and not a fighter. The 48-year-old 30 Rock star, who makes his return to movies in Fist Fight on Feb. 17, admits he didn't take naturally to school brawling. Morgan's first fist fight in his tough Brooklyn neighborhood was accidental and ended up with him getting a butt-kicking from a classmate he had a crush on. "I was a kid, I was in the third grade. It was a girl. I was young and I liked her and I didn’t know how to express it. So when you are a kid, I punched her. Because I liked her," Morgan tells USA TODAY. "And she whooped my (butt)." Morgan admits his foe had heavyweight champion fighter credentials. "She had Sunny Liston hands and whipped the (insides) out of me," he says. "It was bad. Everyone in the projects was there man. It took years to live that down." Tracy Morgan stars in 'Fist Fight.'  (Photo: Bob Mahoney) Morgan had some more successful fighting ventures growing up, but insists he's learned better ways to deal with conflict. "I am not into violence. I am not a violent person," he says. Morgan makes his return to movies with Fist Fight after a near-fatal 2014 accident where his minibus was struck by a truck operated by Wal-mart. Returning to movie-making hit the star fully "when I showed up to the set, and seen all the trailers and the movie stuff that I am used to seeing." says Morgan. It became very real when director Richie Keen said "action" on his first day. Then it was something like riding a bicycle. "It was like any other director in my life has ever said 'action,' I relax," says Morgan. "Most people get uptight, they get intense. But I relax. I become me." "He was able to welcome me back into show-business," says Morgan of the director and cast. "They relaxed me and supported me. And I was able to be me. And funny."

State authorities may have been violating their own state laws for years by issuing commercial fishing licenses to thousands of foreign workers who have been refused entry into the United States, the Associated Press has found. ASSOCIATED PRESS A group of local residents and activists stood outside the state Capitol, Oct. 19, ahead of a meeting about labor conditions for foreign fishermen in Hawaii’s commercial fleet in Honolulu. State authorities may have been violating their own state laws for years by issuing commercial fishing licenses to thousands of foreign workers who have been refused entry into the United States, the Associated Press has found. ASSOCIATED PRESS A catch of fish was unloaded, on Feb. 2, from a commercial fishing boat at Pier 38 in Honolulu. State authorities may have been violating their own state laws for years by issuing commercial fishing licenses to thousands of foreign workers who have been refused entry into the United States, the Associated Press has found. They work without most basic labor protections just a few miles from Waikiki’s white sand beaches, catching premium tuna and swordfish sold at some of America’s most upscale grocery stores, hotels and restaurants. About 700 of these foreign fisherman are currently confined to vessels in Honolulu without visas, some making less than $1 an hour. Hawaii authorities may have been violating their own state law for years by issuing commercial fishing licenses to thousands of foreign workers who were refused entry into the country, The Associated Press has found. Under state law, these workers — who make up most of the crew in a fleet catching $110 million worth of seafood annually — may not be allowed to fish at all, the AP found. A recent industry-sponsored assessment of crew members’ treatment and living conditions found no human trafficking, but raised concerns that workers could be vulnerable to exploitation and said they have little recourse about paying fees or incurring debt in order to hold their jobs. “There exists no system of grievance mechanisms for crew to voice concerns over pay,” according to the report. In this unique fishing arrangement facilitated by both federal and state officials, Hawaii’s boat owners pay brokers up to $10,000 to bring each crew member from impoverished Southeast Asian and Pacific island nations. The men aren’t allowed to arrive at Honolulu’s airport because they lack visas, so they are instead flown to other countries and put on U.S.-owned fishing boats for long sails back to Hawaii. Before the men start working, they need a state commercial fishing license. In order to get it, Hawaii requires that they must be “lawfully admitted” to the U.S. Here’s the hitch: When they arrive, they are met at the dock by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents who ban them from entering the country by stamping “refused” on their landing permits, which voids them. So instead of being “lawfully admitted,” they are now barred by law from setting foot on U.S. soil. “Try taking a check to your bank that says ‘void’ on it and telling them, ‘Oh, but they wrote the check to me,’” said Hawaii attorney Lance Collins, who advocates for the workers. Nonetheless, a written opinion by Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said the Department of Land and Natural Resources provides the landing permits as proof the fishermen are “lawfully admitted.” U.S. Customs sees it differently. “NO. They cannot be admitted,” spokesman Frank Falcon wrote in an email, adding that the stamp means they can’t even enter the U.S. temporarily. In rare cases, including medical emergencies, Customs can parole the men to go ashore. Foreign crews on boats and aircraft, including cruise ship workers and flight attendants, fill out landing permits when they arrive in the U.S. Customs takes those applications and decides whether to allow each individual to temporarily enter the country. When landing permits are stamped refused, that serves as proof that authorities have been alerted that foreigners without visas are on arriving vessels or planes, and triggers an order for captains to detain them on board. Chin’s office did not respond to AP’s queries about the refusal stamp. However, Land and Natural Resources department spokesman Dan Dennison said in an email that the attorney general advised his agency to continue issuing fishing licenses to the foreign workers despite the fact that Customs says the men are not “lawfully admitted.” The Hawaii Longline Association, which represents boat owners, says the men are legally hired for legitimate work on the fleet’s 141 active vessels. And while the conditions and pay are often below U.S. standards, the jobs are typically better than the bleak opportunities the men have at home, mostly in the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia and the tiny Pacific island of Kiribati. Under federal law, U.S. citizens must make up 75 percent of the crew on most American commercial fishing boats. An AP investigation last year revealed Hawaii’s fleet relies on a federal loophole allowing the foreign fishermen to work. In a hearing prompted by the AP report, Land and Natural Resources department administrator Bruce Anderson was asked why he issues commercial fishing licenses to foreign workers who can’t enter the state. He said the crewman’s landing permit “says in essence that the individual has the right to fish in U.S. waters but cannot step ashore.” He did not mention that all the permits were stamped “refused.” Democratic state Rep. Kaniela Ing, chairman of the Ocean, Marine Resources and Hawaiian Affairs committee, has queried Chin and other state officials at length about why the men cannot leave their boats. Ing said state officials failed to disclose the refusal stamp to him when he asked to see the landing permits. “It always seemed paradoxical that the proof of lawful entry was a landing form, but the crew members weren’t allowed to land or leave the boat,” he said, after the AP told him about the stamp. “We just didn’t have the smoking gun evidence to point to why, and now we do.” Critics say the fishing licenses could be just one of several ways the state is breaking its own laws: —The lowest-paid fishermen have contracts promising $300 a month, well below the state’s wage minimums. The Labor Department says it doesn’t intervene because the workers fall under federal, not state, jurisdiction. But department head Linda Chu Takayama also said she’s awaiting further legal guidance. — Chin, the attorney general, said in his written opinion that employers in Hawaii typically cannot withhold wages, but some fishermen told the AP they are paid only after returning home when their one- or two-year contracts end. — Chin said telling consumers “that fish had been caught by local fishermen” may violate the state’s deceptive practice laws if misinformation likely affects their shopping choices. The Hawaii Seafood Council claims the catch is “produced by Hawaii’s hard-working fishermen.” Council Program Manager John Kaneko did not respond to the AP. Federal law also is in question: U.S. Customs requires captains to detain the men on board and hold their passports because they are banned from entering the country. That potentially goes against U.S. human-trafficking laws saying bosses who possess workers’ identification documents can face up to five years in prison. The foreign fishermen’s catch is sold everywhere from Costco to Sam’s Club and upscale restaurants across the U.S., including Trump International Hotel Waikiki. Whole Foods announced it would suspend buying seafood from the fleet after the AP’s initial report, while Costco says it is monitoring the situation. The Trump hotel and Wal-Mart, which owns Sam’s Club, did not provide an immediate response. The story also exposed dangerous, unsanitary conditions and at least two instances of human trafficking. It prompted new commitments from boat owners to protect the crew members’ welfare. After a follow-up briefing on Capitol Hill, several members of Congress expressed “grave concerns” about working conditions in a letter to the Coast Guard and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Hawaii Seafood Council’s survey of 207 fishermen identified a series of potential problems, particularly involving recruiting and payment of the foreign crew. Some fishermen had contracts requiring that part of their salaries or identification papers be withheld until they returned home. Others had signed agreements that said they had to pay for replacement workers if they broke their contracts, or faced $5,000 fines for absconding — equivalent to a year’s salary for some. However, the assessment also found some fishermen had excellent relationships with their captains. All said they were being paid in cash, and none expressed concerns about forced labor or human trafficking. No one complained about access to food, but the report described one labor agent as saying that she had men on a boat who had not been paid for two months and that she bought groceries for fishermen at times when their boats ran out. The industry has implemented a new universal crew contract that requires owners to pay all recruiting fees and gives the fishermen their salaries within four days of landing. A draft Code of Conduct seeks to safeguard workers’ rights. But there are no wage minimums as initially promised by Hawaii Longline Association president Sean Martin. The Honolulu Fish Auction now does business only with boats whose workers have signed those agreements. Martin declined to be interviewed, but he and other industry leaders have condemned labor abuses. They have said the workers are happy to have the jobs and typically do not complain, with many renewing their contracts and even recruiting relatives. Still, little has changed, with foreign crews typically spending three weeks a month at sea, working up to 20 hours a day, usually for far less than American fishermen nationwide, who average $2,500 a month. Their situation has been widely accepted as legal. The AP investigation is part of an ongoing global look at labor abuses in the fishing industry, stretching from Southeast Asia to America’s own waters. In 2015, the AP reported on fishermen locked in a cage and others buried under fake names on the remote Indonesian island village of Benjina. Their catch was traced to the United States, leading to more than 2,000 slaves being freed. But thousands more remain trapped worldwide in a murky industry where work takes place far from shore and often without oversight. In Hawaii, most vessels dock at piers 17 and 38, which are guarded and patrolled, but some go as far as the West Coast. And, although technically not allowed, they do venture onto the piers briefly to socialize and use restrooms. Last year, Customs said six fishermen were deported after wandering away from their boats in Honolulu, some to visit friends on other vessels, others sneaking away for a drink. In 2010, two Indonesian fishermen who fled their boat in San Francisco alleging abuse were granted visas as victims of human trafficking and are now suing their former boat owner. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice said agents checking out a number of leads related to possible human trafficking in the fleet have “identified instances where crew members were contending with less than ideal working conditions,” but found no situations meeting the legal threshold to bring criminal charges. Federal marine observers, who live with the men for weeks at a time at sea, said some fishermen have good working conditions while others are sometimes mistreated, not given proper health care, provided unclean drinking water and fed bait and rice. Many are forced to use buckets as toilets on board. Others in the community also have concerns. Uli Kozak, an Indonesian language professor at the University of Hawaii who has long exchanged home-cooked meals for fresh fish, said the workers sometimes ask for vegetables because of shortages on board. He said some captains have banned men from speaking their native language on boats. There’s “a lot of verbal abuse, even physical abuse, being slapped in the face,” Kozak said. “I have come across cases where people said, ‘If I had ever known that it would be as bad as this, I would have never taken that job.’” Get the latest news by email Sign Up Share this: PREV NEXT Most Read Tata out as Kahuku football head coach Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson joins critics of Under Armour CEO’s Trump remark Ward Warehouse to close in August Former UH professor rules against Trump ‘Inhumans’ TV series to be filmed in Hawaii 11 comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

GONEGOLFIN says: February 10, 2017 at 10:11 am Something has to be done about this situation. These poor men are literally stuck between a rock and hard place. There needs to be legislation done to correct the laws to not only enable these men to be working legally. Too many are used as basically slaved labor and their rights (which are basically none) are null and void. This is an inhumane practice and needs a overhaul NOW!

Along the way, we’ll uncover some of the challenges, thrills, and secrets of the trade and, hopefully, get a sense of what gives the American cinematic landscape its unique identity. Marie Kondo, founder of the ubiquitous “KonMari” method, has become famous for advising people who live in cluttered homes to gather all their possessions and keep only those that “spark joy.” If most film streaming services are overrun with the cinematic equivalent of tchotchkes and ill-fitting clothing, MUBI, with its constantly rotating selection of only 30 critically acclaimed films, might be the first to truly embrace a “KonMari” approach to curation. Typical MUBI offerings include everything from 5-part 1970s Japanese crime sagas to recent Best Picture-winning American films to 1960s Italian sex comedies. Recently, MUBI has launched its “Discoveries” series, exclusively presenting films that have just premiered at some of the world’s most exciting film festivals. To learn more about the philosophy behind MUBI’s unique curatorial style, I spoke to MUBI’s Director of Content, Daniel Kasman. How did you get involved with MUBI? I’ve been here for 9 years, coming up on my 10th year. I’m actually the longest-tenured employee here. I came on at the very beginning when it was just a vision of the CEO, Efe Cakarel, who wanted to create a digital space where one could find art films, or classic and independent films not being distributed or available digitally. And this was 2007, so there really weren’t many streaming services out there. Efe didn’t come from a film background, but he’s sort of self-taught. He went to the Cannes market, went to the distributors, the sales agents, talked to people, and learned the business that way. At the time, I was interning at Zeitgeist Films, which was a small New York based distributor. I’d just graduated from NYU with a degree in Cinema Studies, and I met Efe because he was looking to require films from Zeitgeist. He had just launched this product called “The Auteurs.” Because the platform was very early, it was basically a CEO, a lead developer, a secretary developer, and a designer. But no film staff. So, I became the film staff. When Netflix and Amazon started to offer streaming, what was MUBI’s reaction? At first, we basically felt we could keep doing what we were doing, which was operating a TVOD/SVOD catalogue service. TVOD is transactional video on demand, where you pay one fee to get one film, sort of like iTunes, and SVOD is subscription video on demand, like Netflix, where you pay a subscription fee and get access to a lot of content. We had a library of films that were all acquired under long term acquisition deals, but our goal was quality over quantity. That’s fine if you have 200 films or 300 films, but once we had 1000, 2000, 3000 films…They’re all good films, but if we have Wong Kar Wai and Akira Kurosawa films and then we put a small, independent documentary on the platform, you’re going to be scrolling through 2000 films and still never notice it. And we really did want to feature these films that can’t be seen elsewhere, so we shifted from that model to what we have now, which is more ephemeral and adapted from cinematheque retrospectives and festival showings. When you only have access to a limited number of films, it’s very clear what’s available and what’s not, as well as why we’ve chosen each film. How did you land on the 30-day window? We just thought there was a beautiful simplicity in a month. We wanted to create a window that was neither too much, nor too little time. You know, a week is too much pressure, a year is too much time. Like, then, there’s no reason to watch the film today. So, with a month, we thought we’d found a nice middle ground that also led us to introduce this idea of one film a day. I think it’s important to introduce a structure into programming because once you have a structure, then you can be more free you can show whatever you want, whenever you want. When there’s no structure, the selection expands and contracts at will. I imagine the 30-day window also allows you much more flexibility to get certain movies. Exactly. This model isn’t just for the audiences to get to see these movies, but also for the filmmakers to expose their work in a much more direct, highlighted way, rather than just being dumped into this week’s content update on the platform. Here, we have “the film of the day,” which lets everybody know we put a lot of emphasis on each film we program. Even though some of our deals, are, in a way, like our original catalogue deals where we sign a large number of films from a rights owner and use them as a repository, we can do the exact inverse of that. I might see a movie at Rotterdam next week and say to the director, “This is perfect for MUBI. This is how we’ll treat it. It’s going to have a fun, online run, but it’s not a permanent thing.” I think a lot of filmmakers in the independent sphere are worried about giving permanent access to their films and, for us, this model sort of frees them up. It’s here for a month, and then they can do whatever they want with it. They can then put it on a rival service and let it live there forever, but the purpose is to let them sort of pass through the programming cycle. Daniel Kasman of MUBI. Via Daniel Kasman Do you have some sort of formula in terms of how often you program more obscure movies versus big Oscar movies like No Country for Old Men? Or is it kind of just something you do by feel? It’s all about introducing a flow to the content. It’s a flow that we’re constantly learning how to modulate, and that can mean anything from the literal programming to something abstract or even data-sounding, though it’s not actually data-driven. It’s more like, “How many black and white films does one want to show in a week period before it seems like that’s all you’re showing?” We ask the same question for more visible films. The lineup is different in every country, but we want to make sure that there’s gateway films for people who aren’t cinephiles but looking for an alternative to Netflix. For those people, we want to make sure that, for those people, a certain number of those thirty films make them say, “Oh I really like that film” or “I heard about that film.” However, by the same token, we also want to be sure that the opposite is true, that people can land on a given movie and say, “I don’t know what this is, but it looks great!” Are you assuming that your typical subscriber continues to use the big services like Netflix and Hulu, in addition to MUBI?  I think so. Obviously, MUBI’s not a replacement for those sort of services that have such a breadth of content, especially ones that focus more on films. I feel like now Netflix is sort of moving away from focusing on films so much, which provides a good opportunity for us. We start to seem a little bit more like an alternative, but the reality, of course, is that you want to live near both a multiplex and an arthouse cinema. I mean, I subscribe to Netflix, Amazon Prime, Filmstruck, and MUBI. Each app offers different things, and obviously, there’s a threshold for our audiences, in terms of how many things they are willing to subscribe to. But on the whole, we’re trying to offer an experience that is different and supplemental to a dominant service. One thing that stuck out right away about MUBI is its crisp and clear design. Can you talk about your goals for the look of the app and how it contributes to the experience of watching your films? I’m flattered and pleased that you picked that out because it’s something that really gives us a lot of pleasure. We love design, and we want to be as consistent in our ethos as possible, which is that if we’re choosing really good movies, we want to be presenting them really well. Whether that means using the best master we can find or the best encoding processes we can use to turn those masters into the best streams, I think the user experience is almost as important as the film quality. We’re all cinephiles on this team, and it saddens us that fewer and fewer people are going to the movies. So you’re losing something of the specialness of watching a film, especially in a larger catalogue service, where you’re doing a lot of scrolling, and it’s all kind of sloppy looking. Then, it’s like shopping at Walmart and you’re just choosing a film from a rack. For us, that’s not what movies are. Movies are special, and we’ve tried to feed that ethos into the web design and the iOS design. The new iOS design, for example, puts forward a lot of features that we’ve already had in the web app. Specifically, bringing to the forefront our retrospectives and ongoing series, which are always happening. but the old design didn’t quite communicate those as clearly as possible. We want people to know the film that we’re showing today in the US is part of a French festival series, for example. It’s also incorporated content from our Notebook, which is our editorial publication that I also run. So, then, when you’re watching that film, you have the opportunity to engage with this supplementary content. You guys seem to have a great relationship with Film Society of Lincoln Center and other cinematheque-type places, which is interesting because, in some ways, it feels like your companies would be in competition with each other. Can you talk about how you started to establish those relationships and what you’re both getting out of them? Those kind of partnerships are really important to us—and we do consider ourselves partners rather than just sponsors—which comes from the original vision of MUBI as a provider of global access to films that are otherwise difficult to see. The reality is that Oberhaus is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, short film festivals in the world. But who gets to go to Oberhaus in Germany in May and watch these films? And if they’re not getting picked for the Oscars, you’re certainly not going to see them. Exactly. And even if one of those shorts is getting picked by the Oscars, maybe you don’t live in a town that has the kind of art cinema that would screen the Oscar-nominated shorts program. As a result, we’re talking about a lot of people who don’t get to see these movies, and potentially aren’t even aware they exist. And so, for us, it’s always important to find like-minded partners who support the kind of cinema we do, which is the first step—we’re not interested in partnering with people that show crap—and want to get their programming out there. So part of our pitch to these partners is to use MUBI as a platform to expose their programming to a wider audience. Since the films they show are very similar to the films we show, it’s not a conflict of interest for them to guest program, if you will, the films that they have. Sometimes the movies on MUBI are also available on Netflix or Hulu. How important is it to you that your films be exclusively offered on your service? Well, I think in an ideal world, everything we would show would be exclusive, but because we’re very filmmaker-first, we want to make sure that films are maximizing their profits. We’re a small service. We make all our films money, but we’re not the financial solution for any of these films, unless we’re talking about maybe a short film. So, for us, putting a film on MUBI is maybe a part of a film’s distribution strategy, especially New York films. So, while we desire exclusivity for us, it might not always make sense for the filmmaker. Is there a specific catalogue or movie that you always wanted to try to bring to the service but you’ve not been able to touch for various legal or financial reasons? One thing I not only want to bring to the service, but also to the U.S. in general, is a retrospective on Luc Moullet. He was one of the Cahiers du Cinema writers, along with Rivette and Truffaut and so forth. He got started a little bit later; his first film was in 1966, so technically, the New Wave was already over at that point. He’s an amazing critic, but too little of his criticism has been translated. His films are super funny; they’re very low-fi and droll and deadpan. There’s this great quote that said he was the only heir to Jacques Tati and Bunuel. And why aren’t you able to program his work? Are the rights tied up or are his movies untranslated? Well, each film presents its own problem. In an ideal world, all his films would reside with one rights owner, which would allow digital masters. They’d look good, they’d be in English, and it’d just be a matter of us convincing them we’ll present them in a way that will please them and make them the right amount of money. But, often, that’s not the case at all. The rights are scattered. Some of the masters exist, some don’t. Some are translated and some aren’t. A big reason why MUBI isn’t programmed in the same way that a cinematheque is programmed is because the rights and materials situation is so different from just simply—I’m putting simply in air quotes—finding a film print and paying that screening fee. I realize that that’s not nearly as easy as I’m making it sound, but somehow, the incursion of digital rights and digital materials has made it sort of additionally complicated. Like, if you can imagine the complication of sourcing an archival print of a Czech film that no one has seen from the 50s. Doing the digital version of that is even more difficult because it’s doing that, plus the transfer and subtitles and so on. Aliza Ma from the Metrograph was telling me how difficult it can be to program Hong Kong movies, especially from the ‘80s and ‘90s, because the prints and rights could be anywhere. That’s a particularly heartbreaking scenario because those films have already, for the most part, been translated into English, but many times, they’ve either not been preserved well or they haven’t been made available digitally. And, in some cases, if a distributor chopped up a film and threw a terrible dub on it, as is the case with many of the Hong Kong movies Miramax released in the ‘90s, you don’t have the option of getting a subtitled or uncut version, at least for the US market. Yeah, what’s interesting about digital rights is how specific they are to specific masters of those films. So, yes, in that example, those are Miramax films. We prefer for our films not to be dubbed, so, for us, it’s always a question of whether a certain film is worth showing under imperfect circumstances. Those circumstances might include dubbing or poor subtitling or even a poor master copy. If it’s a masterpiece and it doesn’t really look that great, but it fits into the retrospective we’re doing, it’s worth it to show the film. But, there are other cases, especially with the aggregators whose stuff you see on Amazon, when a film has been acquired through public domain, and the masters are terrible. And then they code them terribly. At that point, we just draw a line, even if it’s something we really want to show. it goes back to what you were talking about in terms of design. There’s a certain experience that we want to encourage, and once we set that standard, we can’t downgrade from that.   Up Next‘Fifty Shades Darker’ Review: Porn Without Pain, Plot or Point Article continues below More from Culture ‘Fifty Shades Darker’ Review: Porn Without Pain, Plot or Point Must Reads Up Next‘Fifty Shades Darker’ Review: Porn Without Pain, Plot or Point Observer About Newsletters Advertise Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP

Share this article EL SEGUNDO, Calif., Feb. 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- MEGA™, the number two construction brand and part of the Mattel portfolio, organizes its big-block product line under the Mega Bloks® name and introduces Mega Construx™, a new sub-brand of construction sets designed for kids ages four through adult collectors. The new Mega Construx line offers the most detailed and authentic micro-figures in the construction aisle, so fans can immerse themselves in the worlds they love. Under the MEGA brands umbrella, Mega Bloks inspires preschool builders ages one to four, and Mega Construx offers older fans immersive sets that feature authentic characters and varied brick shapes with endless colors. Mega Construx sets itself apart from the competition with unique character figures, allowing the brand to deliver authentic looks for popular licenses, such as American Girl®, Barbie®, Despicable Me®, Halo®, Destiny, and more. "Mega Construx drives a deeper connection to different worlds through unparalleled details in the construction category," said Bisma Ansari, SVP & Global Brand GM of MEGA Brands. "MEGA encourages creators, or 'Beyonders' as we call them, to 'build beyond' – a rallying cry for our fans who go beyond the rules of construction and build their world." This month, Mega Construx is launching the "Build Beyond™" campaign, the first full-scale marketing initiative since Mattel acquired the Montreal-based company in 2014. This is the first brand-focused campaign, veering away from product-focused marketing. The campaign launches with a brand spot, created by Sid Lee, premiering in theater pre-roll and rolling out digitally starting in mid-February. Mega Construx products are available at retailers nationwide, including Toys R Us, Wal-Mart, Target and Amazon. For more information and images, visit www.megaconstrux.com.

(Maddi Driggs) Fans of the popular NBC show “Parks and Recreation” know exactly what Galentine’s Day entails, but for those who don’t, Leslie Knope has the answer. “It is only the best day of the year,” according to “Parks and Recreation” character Leslie Knope. Galentine’s Day is a day set aside for women. It’s a day that solely celebrates gals and their pals. Women all over the world now celebrate this fictional holiday by pampering each other with gifts, food and I love you’s. BYU student Cecelia Proffit and English major Maegan Taylor are teaming up with Sodalicious and the International Rescue Committee (IRC) to use Galentine’s Day as a means of service this year. Proffit has continually followed the media coverage of the worldwide refugee crisis closely. When the crisis in Aleppo, Syria, increased in severity, she felt she needed to do what she could to help. “With everything going on in the news, I was wanting to do something, anything, to help out,” Proffit said. “I began doing a lot of research on trustworthy organizations who were doing great work on the refugee crisis. The IRC stood out for having a chapter in Salt Lake City and working with refugees locally, as well as around the world.” Proffit soon realized she and her friends could connect with the IRC and collect donations for refugees. “I’ve talked to people who just feel helpless,” Taylor said. “We march in the protests, we do what we can in our small communities, but it doesn’t feel like it makes any difference. This is our chance to do something that will actually impact people’s lives.” Sodalicious found out about the team’s Galentine’s Day plans and decided to get involved. “We are really excited that Sodalicious is letting us use their space at the Village, and we are very grateful to them for that,” Proffit said. “Sodalicious will be donating 100 percent of its profits from the event.” The “Galentine’s Day with a purpose” event will be held Monday, Feb. 13, 2017, at the Sodalicious located at the Village at South Campus from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. Those who desire to celebrate Galentine’s Day with their friends can not only go to Sodalicious to spend time with each other, but can also go for a good cause. People who attend can bring items that will be donated to refugees. The initiative is focusing its efforts of collecting donations of laundry detergent, dish and hand soap, baby wipes and cleaning wipes because, according to the IRC, refugees need these items most. Proffit and Taylor will also be collecting gift cards to stores like Smith’s, Wal-Mart and Target. Those who attend will also be able to make Valentine’s cards to give to refugee families. “It’s going to be a really casual event,” Taylor said. “Come when you can, bring what you can and stay for as long as you can. We will be enjoying each others company while hopefully making a difference in a lot of people’s lives.” More information about the event can be found here.     Tags: Cecelia Proffit, Galentines, international rescue committee, Maegan Taylor, refugees, Sodalicious, The Village at south campus, Valentines Day Alexa Anderson Alexa is a BYU student majoring communications with an emphasis in public relations.

"Following" : "Follow"}} February 10, 2017 1:29pm   Comments Share: Related AMZN Jim Cramer Thinks Nvidia Remains A 'Frighteningly Positive Story' Will Amazon Expand Into Brick And Mortar? Some Wall Street Analysts Are Saying Yes Amazon And Apple: A New Battle For A $500 Billion Market (Seeking Alpha) Related DG Will Amazon Expand Into Brick And Mortar? Some Wall Street Analysts Are Saying Yes Discount Shares Continue Expansion, Primed To Profit Like It's 2009 Stocks Hit New Highs On Trump's Mystery Tax-Cut Plan B (Investor's Business Daily) Bernstein maintains its Outperform rating on Dollar General Corp. (NYSE: DG), saying the stock offers good value as the declining middle class and shrinking household size should offset short term pricing pressures. Further, the brokerage also called Dollar General as an attractive acquisition target for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), a potential move that could solve the online retail giant’s problem of last mile connectivity. “We believe Dollar General is a well-managed strategic winner with wide open rural markets easily absorbing 1000 more stores a year,” analyst Brandon Fletcher wrote in a note. Fletcher pointed out Dollar General’s strength in rural markets and noted that earnings rose 7 percent from just store growth with almost a decade of growth left to fill the 10,000 open rural spots. Looking Forward Fletcher expects the store growth and continued operational discipline could yield an EPS CAGR of 12 percent (FY 2016–2020) and grow cash flow for another 20 years. Investors are concerned over poor comps that masked the “blazing growth” of nearly 1,000 new stores. But, Fletcher says the comps will stabilize, as he believes Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT)’s price action to moderate by the first quarter, while lower income households adjustment to SNAP changes should benefit comps. Why An M&A Would Be Attractive As such, Fletcher believes Dollar General could be an attractive acquisition target for Amazon with national ‘ship point’ footprint. “The DG footprint is useful as a national ‘ship point’ footprint for AMZN. DG is already close to most homes so 'final mile' can be solved more easily. DG stores have loading docks and back room capacity to help merge online orders with food & consumables,” Fletcher elaborated. In fact, the analyst said Dollar General has a format that is not at genuine risk of disruption from Amazon or any other structural shift. Most of Dollar General stores do not face a Walmart in the same city and modular construction has kept costs to 250,000 per building. “[U]ltra-rural ‘crossroads’ locations are more convenient by many miles than the nearest Walmart, or Family Dollar. These boxes sell less per square foot, but all input costs are lower so IRR is right in line,” Fletcher highlighted. Wall Street is not considering rural as a meaningful market both in terms of population and in terms of income. However, strong farming incomes are reversing the trend. “These crossroad stores are needed, are profitable and are not 'Amazonable' until bought by AMZN,” Fletcher added. At last check, shares of Dollar General fell 1.62 percent to $76.43. Fletcher has a price target of $91, implying potential upside of 19 percent over the current levels.

DEVELOPING STORY — This story will be updated as new information becomes available. LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Amazon said Friday that it will begin collecting sales taxes next month in Arkansas, which lawmakers say could generate as much as $100 million to help lift the state’s lagging revenue and potentially fund future income tax cuts. Arkansas will be the latest state where the e-commerce giant has relented after years of resisting effort to collect taxes in states where it doesn’t have a physical presence. Amazon spokeswoman Jill Kerr said the company will begin collecting the sales tax on March 1, but declined to elaborate on the move. The decision, first reported by Little Rock television station KATV, comes days after Arkansas lawmakers advanced separate efforts to force Amazon to begin collecting sales taxes. A Senate-backed proposal would require Amazon and similar out-of-state companies to begin collecting sales taxes. A state House-backed measure would require Amazon and similar companies to tell Arkansas customers they owe the state sales tax and provide a list to finance officials of purchases made by state residents. Advertisement Continue reading The first sales taxes collected by Amazon will be paid to the state in April. State finance officials declined to comment on Amazon’s decision or the expected revenue from the move, citing a state law that bars them from commenting on the specific status of taxpayers. Republican state Sen. Jake Files, who proposed the Senate-backed bill, has estimated it could bring in between $32 million and $100 million a year. Files said his proposal is still needed to recover funds from other out-of-state companies. “I think it’s a good move for fairness, but it doesn’t complete the fairness circle,” Files said. Files’ measure is modeled after a 2016 law in South Dakota, where officials last month said Amazon agreed to begin collecting sales taxes. The state House bill is modeled after a Colorado law that the U.S. Supreme Court let stand last year. The proposals had the backing of Bentonville-based Wal-Mart, but faced opposition from conservative groups such as Americans for Tax Reform. To avoid collecting taxes, Amazon has historically relied on another high court ruling that predates the era of online shopping. That 1992 decision bans states from forcing out-of-state retailers to collect taxes if they don’t have a physical presence in the state. But the company has shifted recently, with Amazon this winter collecting sales taxes in at least 10 states where it hadn’t previously. Neighboring Oklahoma announced last week that Amazon would begin collecting sales taxes there starting next month. Amazon currently collects sales taxes in 38 states and the District of Columbia, according to the company’s website. Prior to Friday’s announcement, Amazon collected or was preparing to collect sales taxes in every state bordering Arkansas. The decision could raise hopes about Arkansas’ finances. Gov. Asa Hutchinson told several state agencies last week to prepare for possible budget cuts after finance officials said the state’s revenue was $57 million below forecast. Hutchinson, a Republican, repeated his desire Friday that any additional revenue from online sales to go toward further cutting Arkansas’ income tax. Hutchinson last month signed into law a measure cutting the state’s income tax by $50 million and forming a task force to recommend further cuts before the 2019 legislative session. “This strengthened revenue stream will allow us to continue to make progress in cutting the income tax rate, making Arkansas more competitive with our surrounding states, and putting money back into the pockets of hardworking Arkansans,” he said in a statement. ___ Follow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ademillo Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe Most Recent Biz News Suggested Stories: Hyundai replaces General Motors as NFL auto sponsor – Jun 29, 2015 Congress proposes giveaways to auto, trucking industries – Oct 21, 2015 California: Self-driving cars must have driver behind wheel – Dec 16, 2015 San Francisco battles epidemic of auto burglaries – Jun 13, 2016 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

No matter how poorly the company is run by its CEO, hedge-fund billionaire Eddie Lampert, shareholders once again seem willing to believe him when he says it’s different this time. Shares soared as much as 40% today after Lampert announced (yet another) plan to fix the company by cutting overhead, slashing employee pensions and improving operations. Lambert said that, along with cutting costs, the company is borrowing more money, while making plans to sell $1 billion in real estate, all aimed at “a clear path toward profitability.” To seasoned observers, it all sounded depressingly familiar. One Bloomberg analyst called it “a repackaging of existing information to make it sound like progress.” Shares of Sears Holdings Corp—the entity that owns Sears and Kmart— has been in a steady decline for a decade, unable to reverse shopping trends and Lampert’s mismanagement. Sears is one of the great names in US business; the Sears Roebuck catalog, first published in 1894, helped furnish the nation. But like many mass-market retailers, it has fallen on hard times, pinched between discounters like Walmart and the online retailers like Amazon. When Lampert swooped in to rescue Sears a decade ago by merging the company with Kmart, another troubled chain he pulled out of bankruptcy, he was being hailed as the next Warren Buffett. No-one is making those comparisons anymore. Lampert, who formally took the role of CEO in 2013, has been steadily dismantling the company, selling off real estate and assets like Lands’ End, while lending it cash from his hedge fund to prop it up. A brutal article in Bloomberg Businessweek described Lampert’s Ayn Rand-inspired management approach, which pit departments against each other in a “Hunger Games”-style competition for resources. Lampert is also obsessed with technology, and invested heavily in Sears’s online shopping business, with dubious results. In December, after another quarter of losses, Lampert laid out a plan (pdf) to transform its traditional store-based business into a “member-centric integrated retail model” and close 150 stores. Clearly, some investors today are buying what Lampert is selling. But far more shoppers are staying away.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries ePaper Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive After Trump fallout, Uber can't shake envy of Tesla Friday Feb 10, 2017 at 12:25 PM Feb 10, 2017 at 12:25 PM Eric Newcomer Bloomberg While Uber got shellacked for its link to President Donald Trump, the electric carmaker and sometimes-rival Tesla has comfortably weathered its association with a president who has lower approval ratings than any predecessor in his first days in office.  Uber Technologies lost customers and drivers and became the subject of a campaign on Twitter that encouraged people to delete their Uber apps. The opposition compelled Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick to quit Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum. Meanwhile, Tesla faced relatively minimal backlash and no comparable boycott effort, and CEO Elon Musk said he has no plans to quit the committee. The contrast is viewed as a double standard within Uber's headquarters in San Francisco. In private conversations, senior management and investors have groused that Musk has emerged unscathed from his associations with a divisive president and his membership on the same business advisory group that Kalanick had to abandon, according to people involved in these discussions. "That's not representative of how we feel," said Jill Hazelbaker, a spokeswoman for Uber. "No one working at Uber would want another company to experience what we have over the past few weeks." This wasn't the first time Uber watched jealously as Musk sidestepped the very same obstacles encountered by the ride-hailing giant. In December, Uber deployed a small fleet of self-driving cars in San Francisco without applying for an autonomous vehicle license. When the California Department of Motor Vehicles came calling, Uber pointed to Tesla, saying it was only following the automaker's lead. "What we are doing today is just like Tesla," Anthony Levandowski, head of the company's Advanced Technologies Group overseeing self-driving cars and other projects, said at the time. Officials didn't agree. The DMV revoked Uber's car registrations, while Tesla drivers could continue letting their robotic cars guide them around town. Instead of filing the paperwork as more than 20 technology companies and carmakers have-including Tesla, which does so for the autonomous system it's testing but not for cars with Autopilot-Uber relocated its vehicles to Arizona. Each company is shaped by the outsize reputation of its founding leader. Whereas Kalanick is seen as a pugnacious Ayn Rand fan who champions free markets, Musk is a whiz bringing rocket ships, electric cars, traffic-busting tunnels, solar energy and other futuristic goodies to humanity. "Elon Musk absolutely has created the Tesla brand very much based on his personal brand," said Daniel Binns, managing director at Omnicom Group Inc.-owned consulting firm Interbrand. "There's a huge amount of positive goodwill for the brand, and therefore, if there was any sense of negativity, they'd be able to deal with it." The Tesla brand-and by extension, Musk's-represents "a noble ambition: The vision is to make the world more sustainable by providing renewable energy sources, cars and battery sources," Binns said. "Uber doesn't have that. It's not known for being a mission-driven organization." Tesla declined to comment. Uber's Hazelbaker said, "We know we've made mistakes in the past, and we are working hard to serve riders, drivers and cities around the world." Of course, it's a lot easier for people to demonstrate their dismay with Uber. They can delete an account and switch to a competing app. Drivers can change allegiances to U.S. rival Lyft and get a $1,000 sign-up bonus to boot. Lyft ran a national ad campaign to capitalize on this conception of Uber as cold and uncaring. Lyft's darling status among liberals is another source of consternation for the Uber camp, people familiar with the situation said. That's because Lyft's board includes representatives of funds founded by two Trump allies, Peter Thiel and Carl Icahn. Unlike with Uber, it's tougher to dump a $70,000 all-electric, partially autonomous car with few peers on the road. "Uber is a household name," said Bradley Tusk, an Uber advisor and former mayoral campaign manager for Michael Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP. "People interact with it every day, so it is just more familiar to them. Tesla is a great car, but the number of people who interact with Tesla in their daily lives is infinitesimal. They're not analogous." Still, Americans weren't boycotting such ubiquitous American brands as Pepsi or Walmart, whose chiefs also sit on the council. Uber's early scandals shaped the company's image in the minds of many people. It's haunted by such events as the use of surge pricing during Hurricane Sandy and other emergencies, as well as its deployment of underhanded tactics against competitors that backfired. Even today, it's engaged in lawsuits contending that it takes advantage of drivers by not giving them employment benefits or allowing unions. Lyft faces many similar challenges. Last month, Uber settled a Federal Trade Commission suit, without admitting guilt, over claims that it misled drivers about how much they could earn. Last week's Trump ordeal traces its roots to one of the earliest sources of controversy for the company: surge pricing. This time, people were upset that Uber turned it off. On Jan. 28, Uber posted a tweet saying it was suspending fare increases at a New York City airport shortly after cabbies protesting Trump's immigration ban were set to disperse. Uber had wanted to avoid giving the impression of profiteering from a protest, but instead, it was labeled a scab for purportedly trying to break the strike. The outrage was fueled by Kalanick's perceived friendliness toward the Trump administration, thanks to the advisory council and a soft statement he put out after the president signed an executive order targeting immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries. The #DeleteUber movement got celebrity endorsements from Girls creator Lena Dunham, Star Trek actor George Taeki and Modern Family's Jesse Tyler Ferguson. More than 200,000 people removed the Uber app from their phones in a week, a significant increase over the norm, a person familiar with the matter has said. This would amount to at least 2 percent of all active users in the U.S. However, Uber ended the week with more customers than it lost, the person said. Uber could have used a friend in the White House. Its continued skirmishes with regulators across the U.S. would have likely benefited from the attention of a president who favors less regulation. But on Feb. 2, Kalanick called President Trump to say he was leaving the advisory council. Uber put out a series of increasingly strongly worded statements opposing Trump's refugee ban and committed $3 million to help its drivers who were affected by the order. Customers and drivers achieved victory simply by following the playbook the company had given them. For years, Uber has effectively rallied its fans to put pressure on governments to further the company's agenda. The tactic was used to defeat a measure by New York City Mayor Mayor Bill de Blasio in 2015 that would have crippled the ride-hailing app's growth there. Uber's Jeff Jones, who joined last year from Target Corp. where he was chief marketing officer, is one person tasked with helping rehabilitate the company's reputation. Another is Tusk, who advises many technology startups in addition to Uber. He said the company responded wisely when the public's reaction reached a point it couldn't ignore: "When that moment comes, it makes sense to speak out and act on it. In Uber's case, so many of their drivers are immigrants; it made a lot of sense."

Posted 10 Feb 2017 20:40 Updated 11 Feb 2017 07:10 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., February 7, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Wall Street's main stock indexes rose to fresh all-time closing highs on Friday as a spike in oil prices supported energy shares and investors renewed their optimism about President Donald Trump's economic agenda. The S&P 500 tallied its fourth straight session of gains, a day after Trump vowed a major tax announcement in the next few weeks. The benchmark S&P 500 has surged 8.3 percent since Trump's Nov. 8 election, fueled by expectations he will lower corporate taxes, reduce regulations and increase infrastructure spending. The rally had stalled amid concerns over Trump's protectionist stance and lack of clarity on policy reforms. "Investors were worried that the administration may have gotten off track and was pursuing other items," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. "Tax cuts have gotten put back on the front burner," Forrest said, adding, "We are looking for gains in the economy at large from this, not just (earnings per share) gains in stocks." The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 96.97 points, or 0.48 percent, to end at 20,269.37, the S&P 500 gained 8.23 points, or 0.36 percent, to 2,316.10 and the Nasdaq Composite added 18.95 points, or 0.33 percent, to 5,734.13. The S&P and Dow closed at a record high for a second straight session, while the Nasdaq extended its streak of record closes to a fourth day. Energy shares gained 0.8 percent. Oil prices rose more than 1 percent after reports that OPEC members delivered more than 90 percent of the output cuts they pledged in a deal that took effect in January. Energy could continue to be in focus next week, when a host of small-cap companies in energy are due to report results. The S&P financial sector ended up 0.2 percent. The group initially moved higher after Daniel Tarullo, the top Federal Reserve official charged with financial regulation, said he would resign, creating further room for Trump to reshape the Fed's policymaking staff. The focus on Washington comes as large U.S. companies were set for their second straight quarter of profit increases after several periods of declines. With more than 70 percent of the S&P 500 having reported results, fourth-quarter earnings are on track to have climbed 8.4 percent, which would be the best performance since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "We are seeing a pretty solid rate of beats and we’re out of the earnings recession," said Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial Group in Salt Lake City. Activision Blizzard surged 18.9 percent after the videogame publisher reported higher-than-expected revenue and set a US$1 billion share buyback program. Its shares gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Skechers USA jumped 19.3 percent after the footwear maker's fourth-quarter revenue beat expectations. Sears Holding soared 25.6 percent after the struggling retailer said it would cut costs by US$1 billion and reduce debt and pension obligations by at least US$1.5 billion this year. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.60-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.05-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 48 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 151 new highs and 22 new lows. About 6.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.7 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

(Mark Blinch/Reuters) A Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) logo is seen in Toronto November 9, 2007. (Mark Blinch/Reuters) At midday: TSX posts record high as oil prices climb Add to ... Reuters Published Friday, Feb. 10, 2017 11:36AM EST Last updated Friday, Feb. 10, 2017 11:39AM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Canada’s main stock index rose on Friday to an all-time high on strengthening oil prices and hopes of business-friendly tax cuts in the United States, while a surge in domestic jobs suggested the country’s economy was picking up. At 11:32 a.m. ET, the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index rose 111.47 points, or 0.71 per cent, to 15,727.17, having breached its 15,685.13 peak from September 2014. U.S. President Donald Trump’s promise of a “phenomenal” tax plan has helped revive a post-election rally in stocks, with Wall Street also reaching record highs. U.S. crude prices were up almost 2 per cent after reports that Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries members delivered more than 90 per cent of the output cuts they pledged in a landmark deal that took effect in January. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd climbed 1.5 per cent to $39.62, while the overall energy group gained 1.4 percent. Cameco Corp rose 1.3 per cent to $14.43 even after it reported on Thursday a lower-than-expected quarterly profit, hurt by weak uranium prices. The heavyweight financials group rose 0.6 per cent as bond yields climbed, with Royal Bank of Canada advancing 0.7 per cent to $96.86. Higher bond yields reduce the value of insurance companies’ liabilities and increase net interest margins of banks. Agrium Inc forecast on Thursday a less profitable year than expected and said its quarterly profit plunged. Still, the fertilizer maker’s shares rose 1.1 per cent to $138.27 while the materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added 0.9 per cent. Gold futures fell 0.4 per cent to $1,230.5 an ounce but copper prices jumped 4.2 per cent to $6,066 a tonne due to a strike at the world’s biggest copper mine in Chile. Sierra Wireless Inc surged more than 26 pe rcent to $30.87 after reporting fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results on Thursday. Canadian job growth unexpectedly surged in January as hiring in the service sector helped the labor market build on its momentum from the latter part of 2016. U.S. stocks hit record highs on Friday as investors cheered President Donald Trump’s vow to unveil a major tax reform plan in the coming weeks. Mr. Trump’s promise of a “phenomenal” tax plan helped reignite a post-election rally, which had stalled in recent weeks on concerns over his administrative priorities and the lack of clarity on policy reforms. “The market is saying, ‘Thank you for coming back to the very core of the reasons we have accepted your agenda’,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. The dollar index was up 0.3 per cent to a three-week high of 101.01. Gold was down 0.3 per cent. The S&P 500 energy index was up 0.85 per cent and gave the broader index its biggest boost. Industrial stocks, which have been among the top gainers in the post-election rally, also rose 0.6 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 72.35 points, or 0.36 per cent, at 20,244.75, the S&P 500 was up 5.19 points, or 0.22 per cent, at 2,313.06 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 12.03 points, or 0.21 per cent, at 5,727.21. Ten of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher. Consumer staples was the outlier, largely due to a 1.6-per-cent fall in Wal-Mart shares. The ongoing corporate earnings season helped buoy sentiment. Activision Blizzard surged 17 per cent and gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500. The videogame maker reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and a $1 billion share buyback program. Skechers USA was up 22 per cent after its fourth-quarter revenue beat expectations. Sears Holding jumped 31 per cent to $7.27 after the struggling retailer said it would cut debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion this year. Mead Johnson was up 4.7 per cent after Reckitt Benckiser finalized a $16.6 billion deal to buy the infant formula maker. Oil prices rose nearly 2 per cent on Friday after reports that OPEC members delivered more than 90 percent of the output cuts they pledged in a landmark deal that took effect in January. Supply from the 11 members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with production targets under the deal fell to 29.921 million barrels per day, according to the average assessments of the six secondary sources OPEC uses to monitor output, or a 92 percent compliance. The International Energy Agency (IEA) - one of OPEC’s six sources - said the cuts in January equated to 90 percent of the agreed reductions in output, far higher than the initial 60 percent compliance with a 2009 OPEC deal. “Some producers, notably Saudi Arabia, (are) appearing to cut by more than required,” the agency said in a report. While the deal has boosted oil prices, Capital Economics analysts said in a note, “we think U.S. production is likely to rebound and that it will be strong growth in demand that will eventually eat into stocks and rebalance the market.” Global benchmark Brent crude was up $1.07, or 1.92 per cent, at $56.70 a barrel. It touched a session high of $56.76. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures traded up 99 cents, or 1.87 per cent, at $53.99 a barrel. Brent was on track for its first weekly drop in four weeks while U.S. crude headed for its fourth straight week of gains. Crude has also benefited from recent strength in gasoline prices as a glut seems to be gradually eroding. Gasoline futures were leading the energy complex on Friday, trading up about 2.2 percent. The IEA, which advises industrial nations on energy policy, said if current compliance levels hold, the global oil stocks overhang that has weighed on prices should fall by about 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the next six months. The agency also raised global oil demand growth expectations for 2017 to 1.4 million bpd, up 100,000 bpd from its previous estimate. Nevertheless, producers will probably have to extend the production cuts beyond six months if they want to achieve their goal of balancing the oil market. Weekly U.S. rig count data from Baker Hughes later on Friday will indicate whether drillers are continuing to ramp up activity. SEB chief commodities analyst Bjarne Schieldrop said he expected 198 new U.S. oil rigs to come into action in 2017, with 51 added already this year. “We calculate that one extra rig added today will lead to a stream of new wells which cumulatively will produce 5.3 million barrels to the end of 2019,” he said.

The award recognizes the state’s 50 fastest-growing mid-sized companies across all industries that have demonstrated significant growth based on a combined three-year average of revenue and employee growth. The 2017 Future 50 winners collectively generate more than $2.15 billion in annual revenue and employ 14,419 individuals in New Jersey. Since its founding, Dyla LLC has more than doubled in size each year. Now, the company’s beverage brands are sold in more than 20,000 retail stores nationwide. “Identifying a market opportunity based on my experience in the food/beverage industry and offering healthier products was a driver of growth,” said founder and CEO Neel Premkumar. “But I also think our talent is a major differentiator. I started the business by myself, and ran it as the only employee for more than two years. This enabled me to do every job and understand the challenges and drivers of success for each role.” As a result, Premkumar was able to zero in on the right talent once it was time to hire. One of the biggest challenges for Dyla has been financing its rapid growth. “Growing this company has really been akin to drinking from a fire hose,” says Premkumar. “In the beginning, I financed growth myself from savings. Then, early on, I brought on my former CEO from Nestle. After a couple of years, we brought on other equity investors, like the former president of our biggest competitor.” For the future, Premkumar says, “part of my personal challenge is avoiding complacency; we have to keep rapidly expanding in our industry in order to compete effectively with bigger consumer food/beverage companies that have incredible scale.” About Stur Stur is the fastest-growing brand in the $1.5 billion Drink Mix category, with products in both liquid and powder format. Made by a father for his family to love water naturally, Stur only contains Organic or Natural ingredients, including real fruit and stevia extracts. Since launching in 2012, Stur has been seen by millions of consumers on monthly TV Shopping shows and has over 100,000 Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest fans. Stur is also the #1 selling drink mix item on Amazon, and is sold in thousands of Natural & Grocery stores across North America, including Walmart-CA, Target, Kroger, Ahold, Albertsons, Publix, Food Lion, Winn-Dixie, Loblaw, ShopRite, Meijer, HEB, and more – driving incremental growth at retail. For additional information on Stur, please visit www.SturDrinks.com About FORTO FORTO is the #1 Coffee Energy Shot, sold in over 15,000 stores nationwide. Created by a father of twins needing wholesome energy – It is made with Organic & Fair-Trade Colombian Coffee – with Extra Energy (200mg caffeine) added through our unique Cold Brew process. The name FORTO is derived from the Italian word for strong (forté), as each handheld bottle of FORTO has as much energy as 2 regular cups of coffee! Since launching across all U.S. Military bases, FORTO has been driving incremental growth for the Energy Shot category in retail stores nationwide. For additional information on FORTO, please visit www.FortoCoffee.com About the Future 50 Awards The Future 50 Awards program is the largest and most highly anticipated SmartCEO awards program of the year. This program recognizes 50 of the region’s fastest-growing mid-sized companies and 10 small Emerging Growth companies. These companies represent the future of the region’s economy and embody the entrepreneurial spirit critical for leadership and success. The winners, chosen based on a three-year average of employee and revenue growth, are listed alphabetically, not ranked.

But Quartz reports that the new worrying trend in retail crime targets less flashy but essential items, like hygiene and beauty products, at an incredibly large scale — which ends up costing retailers big time. According to a study from the National Retail Federation (NRF) from 2014, organized retail crime costs U.S. retailers about $30 billion. By 2015, 97% of businesses polled by the NRF for its annual survey on the topic reported that they were affected by it. That estimated loss isn't made up exclusively of luxury handbags and other high-priced fashion goods: Quartz notes that shoplifters go after items that are "crucial yet pricy," such as baby formula, pregnancy tests, and other health and hygiene products. Shoplifters will then either resell these products online or return them to the retailers for cash, store credit, or even gift cards. Aside from the irony of stores having to buy their own merchandise back, this comes at a great cost to manufacturers and companies, which means it eventually trickles down to the consumers. "In poor neighborhoods, it becomes a real hardship to try and find these things," Nick Selby, a Dallas-area police detective, told Quartz of what happens when shoplifters target lower-income areas and deplete their supply of essential products, such as diabetic testing strips. "If all of your diabetes testing strips are stolen out of the store, at some point you can't charge enough to make that a profitable item. If you’ve got an elderly person who has to get this, they are going to have to leave your city [if] your local pharmacy stops selling them." What's more, Quartz adds this trend accounts for an estimated $1.6 billion loss in sales tax revenue each year — so it's not just stores like T.J. Maxx and Walmart being affected. The figures may stack up when it comes to health and hygiene products, but the same behavior of targeting lower-cost items more frequently is pervasive in the fashion market, too. An anonymous former retail employee told Refinery29 back in 2014 that, when she was a manager at a clothing boutique, she noticed thieves tended to gravitate towards the cheaper items. "I think the people that were stealing didn't have an eye for the expensive stuff," she told us. "I think they were young and just wanted the trendy leggings and didn't want to pay $50 for them. It was always the same: packaged T-shirts, leggings, underwear. Small things that you could roll up and put in your bag." Plus, anyone who's tried to shop a fast-fashion designer collaboration is well aware of resellers. There's also the issue of counterfeits — which, including the fake luxury goods market, is an industry thought to be worth $500 billion worldwide. Plus, this organized retail crime trend requires shoppers to be more vigilant about expired medicine, cleaning supplies, and beauty products, which could actually post health risks to a consumer. Yikes. Head on over to Quartz for the full report. Fashion • News • Shopping • What To Buy Now Photo: Brendon Thorne/Bloomberg/Getty Images. Shop your inbox!

Ogg February 10, 2017 9:10 am EST Print Email Tweet Stocks were indicated marginally higher on Friday morning on what seems to be a very light news day. The Dow is still above 20,000 and the S&P 500 has gone above the 2,300 level. Even though the bull market in nearly eight years old, investors have managed to find new reasons to buy every sell-off. Those same investors are also looking for new and overlooked opportunities. And there is still a path for DJIA 21,422 later in 2017 or in early 2018. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst reports each day of the week. The goal is to find new investing and trading ideas for our readers. Some analyst reports cover stocks to buy, while other reports cover stocks to sell or avoid. Most of the analyst calls with expanded coverage include some color on prices and the consensus analyst price targets are from Thomson Reuters. These are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Friday, February 10, 2017: Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) was raised to Hold from Sell and the price target was raised to $12 from $10 (versus a $12.38 prior close) at Jefferies. The firm believes the bad news in Ford has been more than dissected in the past six months and is now sufficiently priced into the shares. Ford has a 52-week trading range of $11.07 to $14.22 and a consensus analyst price target of $13.19. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) was downgraded to Hold from Buy and the price target was cut to $38 from $43 at Canaccord Genuity. Intel closed down 2.5% at $35.46 on Thursday and was indicated down 0.3% at $35.35 on Friday. Intel’s 52-week range is $28.14 to $38.45, and it has a consensus price target of $41.15. NVIDIA Corp.

Jefferies reiterated its Buy rating and raised its target price to $140 from $125. Starbucks Corp. (NASDAQ: SBUX) was downgraded to Hold from Buy at Argus. While most downgrades seen have been on valuation, the Starbucks call from Argus was based on a weaker sales outlook. Shares closed up 1% at $55.81 on Thursday and were indicated down 0.5% at $55.50 on Friday. Starbucks has a 52-week range of $50.84 to $61.64 and a consensus price target of $64.56. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE: TEVA) was downgraded to Underperform from Neutral and the price target was slashed to $27 from $40 (versus a $32.25 close) at Mizuho. Teva has a 52-week range of $31.90 to $59.35, and the consensus target price was $42.70. Twitter Inc. (NYSE: TWTR) closed down 12.3% at $16.41 on more than 100 million shares after earnings showed that the user metric growth just is not coming. Twitter was downgraded to Hold from Buy at Deutsche Bank. It was cut to Underweight from Neutral at Atlantic Equities and to Sell from Neutral at UBS. And it was cut to Sell from Hold at Loop Capital and to Sell from Neutral at Citigroup. Twitter has a 52-week range of $13.73 to $25.25. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) was started as Positive with an $80 price target at Susquehanna. Wal-Mart has a 52-week range of $62.35 to $75.19 and a consensus price target of $74.04.

Trump's promise of a "phenomenal" tax plan helped reignite a post-election rally, which had stalled in recent weeks on concerns over his administrative priorities and the lack of clarity on policy reforms. "The market is saying, 'Thank you for coming back to the very core of the reasons we have accepted your agenda'," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. The dollar index was up 0.3 percent to a three-week high of 101.01. Gold was down 0.3 percent. Oil prices rose 2 percent after reports that OPEC members delivered more than 90 percent of the output cuts they pledged in a landmark deal that took effect in January. The S&P 500 energy index was up 0.85 percent and gave the broader index its biggest boost. Industrial stocks, which have been among the top gainers in the post-election rally, also rose 0.6 percent. At 11:06 a.m. ET (1606 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 72.35 points, or 0.36 percent, at 20,244.75, the S&P 500 was up 5.19 points, or 0.22 percent, at 2,313.06 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 12.03 points, or 0.21 percent, at 5,727.21. Ten of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher. Consumer staples was the outlier, largely due to a 1.6 percent fall in Wal-Mart shares. The ongoing corporate earnings season helped buoy sentiment. Activision Blizzard surged 17 percent and gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500. The videogame maker reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and a $1 billion share buyback program. Skechers USA was up 22 percent after its fourth-quarter revenue beat expectations. Sears Holding jumped 31 percent to $7.27 after the struggling retailer said it would cut debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion this year. Mead Johnson was up 4.7 percent after Reckitt Benckiser finalised a $16.6 billion deal to buy the infant formula maker. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,895 to 891. On the Nasdaq, 1,629 issues rose and 1,011 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 39 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 106 new highs and 14 new lows.

The Keebler elves are leaving the treehouse for your warehouse, but what does it all mean? Industry observers were speculating as to the motives of Kellogg’s Co., which said this week it was abandoning direct-store delivery for its U.S. snacks business in favor of a more cost efficient warehouse model. The Battle Creek, Mich.-based manufacturer said the move was part of an expansion of its ongoing “Project K” cost savings program, which was designed to lower its annual costs by nearly $500 million by 2018. The DSD discontinuation means the distribution of products like Cheez-It crackers and Keebler snacks will transition from route-based salespeople serving on a store-by-store basis to retailer controlled warehouses, and would be complete by the end of the year. DSD represents approximately of 25% of Kellogg’s sales. “Because our customers' and our own warehouse distribution systems have become more efficient and effective, we can now redeploy resources previously tied to DSD and direct them to the kinds of brand investments that drive greater demand with today's consumers — ultimately growing our business and our retailers' businesses," Kellogg’s CEO John Bryant said in a statement. Retailers will likely find the change a mixed blessing, according to Burt P. Flickinger III of Strategic Resource Group. While DSD typically provides higher levels of support, service and sales than traditional distribution would, Kellogg’s version of it hasn’t been particularly effective, Flickinger contended, citing “horrific” levels of in-stock and “non-competitive” promotional support and merchandising. However, he noted, moving to a warehouse model is likely to help only those retailers with strong self-distribution models, and could mean additional challenges for those who rely on outsourced delivery. In a research note, Barclays analyst Andrew Lazar speculated the move could indicate that softening consumer demand for packaged crackers and cookies simply doesn’t justify the added cost of deploying a fleet of warehouses, trucks and salespeople to stock and sell them, but noted that decision comes with some risk that the bottom line improvements aren’t matched with topo-line sales. Beyond that, Lazar termed the move “an unequivocal positive” for Mondelez and its Nabisco brands, which he said could react either by leveraging its own DSD network to “usurp dramatic incremental shelf space” — or by following suit and dropping DSD itself, but achieving even more benefit than Kellogg’s would given its larger share of the biscuit business. Then there’s the possibility that Kellogg’s could be polishing its valuation for a potential buyout. Noting speculation that the cereal giant has been in the sights of acquisitive CPG investor 3G Capital and its master cost cutters, dropping DSD in advance of such a deal could position Kellogg’s shareholders to gain credit for that bit of heavy lifting, Lazar said. In any event, it’s a change that bears watching. Happy Galentine’s Day Move over, Festivus. Galentine’s Day is the sitcom-created holiday retailers have been waiting for. The “event,” typically celebrated the day before Valentine’s Day, recognizes friendship among women, as first depicted in a 2010 episode of the “Parks & Recreation” television series. This year, Wal-Mart Stores is prepared, having crafted a line of giftware and party accessories with sassy messages meant to be shared among girlfriends. These items, seasonal buyer Wendy Milstead said in a recent blog post, actually represent a blow to the “airing of grievances” of past Walmart assortments that featured such anti-Valentine’s Day sayings like “Cupid is Stupid.” “We wanted to do something with a more positive message,” she said. This Week’s Crystal Ball Peek In a conference call discussing quarterly financial results last week, Natural Grocers co-president Kemper Isley said he felt that consumer uncertainty around the November election – and the mood of shoppers both following the election and again in January when the new administration took office – caused ripples of uncertainty that likely adversely affected sales at the chain. But uncertainty isn’t limited to the company’s shoppers. Asked about the possibility of a border tax as proposed by the new administration, Isley said “drastic inflation” would likely result, but he wasn’t necessarily preparing for it. “I can't predict what an unpredictable president will do,” he said. 0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

William John Grigsby, 28, Clearfield, is charged with two felony counts of theft by deception, 61 misdemeanor counts of other reason access device unauthorized by issuer and 61 counts of receiving stolen property for allegedly using a debit card and credit card belonging to Clearfield Arts Studio Theatre. According to the affidavit of probable cause, two board members contacted police on Oct. 27 with information on the thefts allegedly committed by Grigsby. A statement written by one of the board members explained that Grigsby was both the president and yreasurer of CAST when he allegedly used its funds for personal needs. He allegedly made withdrawals from the group’s building fund totaling $2,244.90 and alsoused the CAST Visa card several times, totaling $2,293.74. The bills on this credit card were paid using funds from the CAST checking account, police said. The transactions were discovered after a new treasurer was appointed at the annual reorganization meeting in September. On Oct. 12, an executive committee meeting was held to investigate the charges. During the meeting, Grigsby made no admission, but after he allegedly sent a text message to the CAST executive committee admitting he had been stealing funds. The alleged message said, “Those charges are mine and I am truly sorry that it happened. I will pay this back and I hope that I don’t have to go to jail but will tender my resignation.” He asked for discretion and stated he would pay the money back. A list of the transactions in the affidavit shows purchases for as much as $414.86 at Wal-Mart. The charges began in January 2016 and ended in late September. The grand total is $4,565.98, according to the report. In October, CAST released a statement from Steve Albert, who is the current board of directors president: “Despite this unfortunate event, CAST is in a positive financial position. We look forward to continued growth and success by providing high-quality arts opportunities to our community.” In September 2015, CAST had a debt of $18,000 and needed to pay a tax payment of more than$2,000 before the end of the month or their buildings would be sold. The former board members all resigned and a new board was elected. This group was able to pay off the tax debt and have led a resurgence of the organization. Grigsby was, at that time, one of the key people involved in saving CAST, according to previous reports.

Daniel B. Kline, The Motley Fool Published 10:32 a.m. ET Feb. 10, 2017 | Updated 17 hours ago CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Even coming off of the busy holiday shopping season, Macy's kicked off 2017 announcing plans to shut 68 stores and cut over 10,000 employees. Sears said it would close 42 locations and 108 Kmart stores in the first few months of 2017. Newslook Shoppers depart a Big K Kmart store. (Photo: Tim Boyle, Getty Images) 97 CONNECTTWEET 118 LINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE Macy's plans to close 68 locations in 2017, and Sears Holdings'  Kmart brand plans to shutter 108 stores (though the numbers for both could go higher, and Sears has a significant risk of filing for bankruptcy protection). The impact of those closings will present both positives and negatives, not only for the companies shutting down the stores, but also for consumers and competitors. A new report from Foursquare examines what happened in 2016 when each of these chains closed stores. The location services company examined foot traffic from more than 50 million monthly global users of Foursquare's apps and websites. The researchers looked at both shoppers who visited closed stores prior to the closure announcement and during the closure period ("typical shoppers"), as well as those who visited to-be-closed stores only after the closure announcement was made ("opportunists"). Store closings: Macy's is closing these 68 stores Is your local Sears or Kmart among 150 stores to be axed? See the list "When a retailer announces store closures, one might assume that competitors see an immediate benefit. Yet that's not what the data tells us," wrote Foursquare's Sarah Spagnolo. "Instead, Millennials surge to closing sales. Loyal shoppers will stick with the retailers they love, traveling further to stores despite access to fewer locations. And competitive companies will have to wait several months before they see a boost in foot traffic to their stores." Millennials are opportunists Once it was announced that a Macy's or Kmart location would close, Foursquare said, both companies saw surges in customers under 35. Kmart, for example, saw 10% more Millennials in the opportunist shoppers who showed up after the closures were announced. Macy's produced similar results with the opportunist group having 8% more Millennials than the typical shopper group. This, Foursquare reported, matched data from Black Friday,when millennial shoppers were willing to visit physical stores as long as there were deals to be had. "Millennials might be pegged as online shoppers, but they shop in stores when they know about a good deal," wrote Spagnolo. Consumers are brand loyal Closing stores does not have to mean losing customers. In many cases, loyal fans will travel farther to visit a chain they like after the store closest to them closes. There are limits to that. Foursquare found that displaced but loyal consumers were willing to travel an additional 4.3 miles to visit the next-closest open Kmart while Macy's fans were willing to go an extra 2 miles to shop at another location. (The Macy's number was impacted by the fact that in many cases the company closed stores in part due to how close they were to other locations). Existing Kmarts that stayed open saw a 39% increase in market share, according to Foursquare. Macy's saw similar gains with its remaining locations seeing a 36% boost in market share. Rivals gain, but it takes time When a chain like Macy's or Kmart closes, its rivals do benefit, but it's not immediate. That's partly because closeout sales suck up a certain amount of money that otherwise would have been spent over a longer period of time. Foursquare's researchers found that T.J. Maxx saw a 47% gain in its market share following a Kmart closure and Wal-Mart had an 8% gain. In the Macy's markets where a store closed. "Marshalls' market share was up 29% relative to its starting point, Kohl's market share was up by 20% and J.C. Penney's market share was up by 10%," according to the report. Dillard's also saw a noticeable spike in sales during the nine-month period after a Macy's closed. Closings create opportunity Whether it's Macy's, Kmart, or another brand shuttering a store (and there are going to be a lot of them this year) opportunities are created for rivals, consumers, and the company doing the closing. Clearly it's possible to retain customers even when closing the locations closest to them. Having fewer competitors is also an opening for rival brands to gain some of those forsaken consumers. For shoppers, however, retail closures create a short- and a long-term opportunity. In the moment, closeout sales offer great deals. In the long run, those same customers should profit from stores seeking their business and the company that closed a location seeking to lure them to travel a bit farther to one of its remaining stores.

They typically suggest using digital coupons. One of our favorites is the Kroger digital app. You can add coupons on the app and they automatically apply when you checkout. Then there’s Aldi, who cuts down on the frills and passes the savings on to you.  Your basic necessities can be found here for cheap. Walmart has always had low prices, have a large diverse selection, and can be great for finding a deal. Monday morning on WMC Action News 5, we compare all three and explain to you which ones have the lowest prices.  Does Kroger have the cheapest eggs?  Or is it Aldi and Walmart?  What about different kinds of meats?  You can find those answers on WMC Action News 5 Monday morning starting at 4:30 A.M.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Amazon.com Inc. plans to start selling its own line of competitively priced women’s intimate apparel on its U.S. website in a direct swipe at Victoria’s Secret, The Wall Street Journal reported. Amazon recently started selling bras for under $10 in Europe, where it uses the label Iris & Lilly, the Journal reported. "Amazon’s entrance into the lingerie space presents a challenge for industry stalwarts such as PVH Corp.’s Calvin Klein and L Brands Inc.’s Victoria’s Secret, which have built their businesses on bras that retail at around $40," the Journal explained. At prices under $10 a bra, Amazon is likely sacrificing profit margin to push into the space. Depending on the size of the order, it can cost a large brand like Victoria’s Secret $10 just to produce and ship an underwire bra from a factory in Asia, people familiar with the matter told the Journal. Meanwhile, Amazon is steamrolling its competitors. With a current market cap of $390 billion, the Seattle-based retail giant is now worth more than the top eight traditional brick-and-mortar retailers combined, as Credit Suisse analysts led by Eugene Klerk mentioned in a recent note, Yahoo Finance reported. For the record, that roster includes Best Buy (BBY), Macy’s (M), Target (TGT), JCPenney (JCP), Nordstrom (JWN), Walmart (WMT), Kohl’s (KSS) and Sears (SHLD). “That’s an impressive, even astonishing feat, no doubt, given Amazon was founded in chief executive Jeff Bezos’ garage in 1994," Yahoo Finance reported. "But it’s not exactly shocking, given the rapid transition over the last 20 years away from shopping in physical retail stores in lieu of online shopping, where retailers like Amazon can offer lower pricing on products and services because they don’t have to offset the costs of also paying for physical stores," Yahoo Finance reported. "It also helps that Amazon has invested heavily in building out new warehouses to reduce delivery time of items from weeks and days to hours, in some cases.” (Newsmax wire services and Reuters and Bloomberg contributed to this report).

Blink-182 is considered a key group in the development of pop punk. The band’s combination of pop melodies with fast-paced punk rock featured a more radio-friendly accessibility than prior bands. The trio has sold over thirteen million albums in the United States so far, and over 50 million albums worldwide. In 2011, The New York Times asserted that “no punk band of the 1990s has been more influential than Blink-182,” and even as the band receded after its 2005 split, “it’s sound and style could be heard in the muscular pop punk of Fall Out Boy or in the current wave of high-gloss Warped Tour punk bands, like All Time Low and The Maine.” Blink-182 was initially known as Blink until an Irish band of the same name threatened legal action; in response, the band appended the meaningless number “-182”. Blink 182 live concerts usualy are one of the most awaited for punk rock music fans. Blink-182 concert tickets are usually big seller, and upcoming tour isn’t exception. TicketsTeam.com has all levels of seating and cost options available to any Blink 182 live concert, also provides a secure online buying experience as well as 200% money back guarantee for the Blink 182 tickets.
