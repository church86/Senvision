Preferring organic, Reeves Hornibrook of Fayetteville recently noted on Facebook that Whole Foods was “breaking her wallet” but then she heard the local Aldi had a large selection of organic products and the savings added up to about 50%. A proprietary pricing study completed in mid-January by Deutsche Bank’s Paul Trussell found Aldi to be “the “clear price leader” when compared to Wal-Mart Stores. The study looked the prices of 43 items and it was conducted in northern New Jersey and Orlando, Fla. Trussell found Walmart to be 13.5% more expensive on average than Aldi. Aldi led in the food and household/personal care product categories, with the food basket at Walmart U.S. costing 14.3% more than Aldi, and the household/personal care basket at Walmart U.S. was 12.7% more expensive. “When looking at only private label SKUs (30 items), Aldi’s price advantage grew further,” Trussell noted. “The private label basket was on average 21.4% more expensive at Walmart than at Aldi. Taking into account national brands, which included 10 items, Walmart was only 2.5% more expensive, on average.” NO-FRILLS Aldi’s lean model includes small formats, no-frills merchandising. The items are are displayed in cardboard boxes often stacked on pallets. There is no need for cart attendants as shoppers are asked to reserve a cart for 25 cents, which is given back when the cart is returned. Shoppers must also provide their own shopping bags, but in many cases shoppers simply pick up empty boxes they see in the store to gather groceries and often consumers put the groceries directly in the car with no bags or boxes. Aldi is able to pass these operational savings to the customers in the form of lower prices. Aldi stores average about 10,000 square feet and offer a limited assortment of around 1,300 of the most commonly-purchased grocery and household item with an emphasis on private brands. The limited item count is a complaint often made about Aldi and also that about 90% of the items are private label. That said consumers like Mary Ann Moffett Jones of Rose Hill, Kan., said she loves Aldi’s Greek yogurt and “It’s just as good as the more expensive brands.” Jones was one of the consumers recently posting on Aldi’s Facebook page. PRICE COMPARISON Talk Business & Politics recently completed its own pricing survey comparing prices from the newly redesigned Aldi in Rogers against Walmart Pickup Grocery, which allows consumers to order items online and pickup at store location of their choosing. Looking at 30 items ranging from meat, produce, dry grocery, dairy and non-edible consumables the basket at Aldi came to $62.47 while the same private label items at Walmart cost $83.89. The overall savings at Aldi on this particular shopping trip was $21.42. Dairy was the category with the biggest savings of 42%. While the large container of plain Greek Yogurt was similarly priced at both stores, there were big savings on milk, eggs and cheese. A dozen large eggs cost just 49 cents at Aldi compared to $1.97 at Walmart. A half gallon of 2% milk cost 59 cents at Aldi compared to $1.85 at Walmart. The large bag of 2% grated Mexican cheese was $2.19 cheaper at Aldi. It’s important to note that the milk and egg prices at Aldi were part of a local promotion and there was a limit of 2 dozen on the eggs. The Deutsche report showed Walmart and Aldi to be competitively priced on a gallon of 2% milk at $3.34 and $1.74 on a dozen of large eggs in the two markets it surveyed. There were also some substantial savings on meat purchased at the Rogers Aldi. A package of Polish Kielbasa, fresh center cut pork chops, one pound of 85% lean ground beef and a 2.5 pound bag of uncooked frozen chicken tenders cost $14.51 at Aldi. Nearly identical items at Walmart cost $19.25. The biggest savings came on the bag of chicken which was 63 cents per pound cheaper at Aldi. The pork chops were $1.22 more expensive at Walmart and the hamburger meat (80% lean) cost $1.20 more. There was also a $1 savings on the sausage at Aldi. Fresh produce, an area where Walmart U.S. CEO Greg Foran has placed much emphasis over the past year, still shows Aldi to have lower prices on six of the seven items purchased. Sliced tomatoes were the only item on the list competitively priced at both stores — $1.99 at Aldi compared to $1.98 at Walmart. The savings on fresh produce, which included organic mixed greens, came to $3.33 at Aldi. Cucumbers were about 30 cents cheaper each, avocados were 30 cents cheaper each and there was about $1 price difference in the organic mixed greens at Aldi. A 5-pound bag of Russet potatoes was 16% cheaper at Aldi and fresh zucchini about 38% less expensive than Walmart. The head of iceberg lettuce cost $1.15 at Aldi versus $1.49 at Walmart. Dry grocery was the area where Aldi and Walmart were most competitive. Walmart was cheaper on taco shells and pasta sauce, but the overall baskets dry grocery savings totaled $4.94 at Aldi. Cashews were $1.79 less expensive, there was a $1 savings on corn tortilla chips with marginal savings on items like a loaf of oat bran bread, walnuts, organic honey, 4-pound bag of sugar and cooking spray. In the Deutsche report there were hefty savings on items like vanilla wafers which were 43% less expensive and raisin bran cereal was 33% cheaper than at Walmart on average. The savings at Aldi are not just found in food. Non-edibles items like 2-pack of paper towel, 3-pack of scrub sponges and a box of 80 count dryer sheets cost a total of $5.67 at Aldi, compared to $8.86 at Walmart in Northwest Arkansas. The Deutsche report looked at Tide detergent (75 oz bottle) which was 50 cents cheaper at Aldi for the exact same product. Pantene Pro-V daily moisture renewal shampoo was identically priced at $3.84 at each retailer as was the Secret powder deodorant at $2.47. The Crest complete (whitening Scope) toothpaste was 22 cents cheaper at Aldi. Walmart was 5 cents less expensive on liquid hand soap but evenly prices or more expensive on the other items checked by Deutsche. Aldi also features at least one or two aisles of general merchandise that changes every week or so. Items like folding card tables, kitchen utensils, laundry baskets, car jacks, toys and even apparel can routinely be found on these treasure hunt aisles. GERMAN THREAT Aldi may not be the only place consumers shop given the limited items but the no-frill grocer continues to expand its U.S. footprint. Aldi USA operates around 1,600 stores in 35 states. In March 2016 Aldi opened its first stores in Southern California and plans to operate nearly 2,000 stores by the of 2018. Though Aldi has had a U.S. presence for several decades it hails from Germany originally where it and its primary competitor Lidl have wreaked havoc on Walmart ASDA in the United Kingdom and other retailers across Europe. Lidl is in the midst of launching its U.S. division along the eastern seaboard states with its regional headquarters under construction in Fredericksburg, Va., and distribution network underway in North Carolina. Lidl has eyed 80 store locations from Georgia to New Jersey and plans to invest $200 million in Virginia alone by 2018. Carol Spieckerman, CEO of Spieckerman Retail, warns that U.S. retailers should take notice of the looming threat Aldi and Lidl present in the next couple of years. “Be afraid, very afraid. Lidl presents a looming threat to any and all U.S. grocers and dollar stores. The combination of Aldi and Lidl is a market share-grabbing nightmare,” Spieckerman told Talk Business & Politics. “European retailers such as Tesco, Sainsbury’s and others learned this the hard way after initially underestimating the potential impact of Aldi and Lidl’s proliferation. Hopefully U.S. retailers won’t make the same mistake. Lidl should be expected to hit U.S. shores with a big bang.” She said in the U.K. Aldi and Lidl doubled market share in one year and together, now command 10% of the grocery market. She expects Lidl won’t drag its feet once its U.S. supply chain and operational infrastructure is up and running. Comments comments Previous post Sen.

Many of the emerging businesses are driven by technological innovations that fall within what AOL founder Steve Case has described in multiple media accounts as the “third wave” of the digital revolution, where every area of our lives relies on the internet. Case writes about it in his book, “The Third Wave,” where he describes the movement, which he says began in 2015, as a time in which entrepreneurs will “vastly transform major real world sectors like health, education, transportation, energy and food — and in the process change the way we live our daily lives.” Here are five key industries identified by those familiar with the Northwest Arkansas startup scene as areas of projected growth and development for the region’s entrepreneurial landscape in 2017. • E-Commerce A few years ago, John James built a Fayetteville-based e-commerce company based on providing products to largely untapped markets, notably raising $83 million in funding in 2013. Acumen Brands paved the way for e-commerce companies like Menguin, an online tuxedo rental company previously based in Atlanta, to set up shop in the area and find success. James not only paved the way for Menguin, he was directly involved in bringing its founders to the region. CEO Justin Delaney said James, now an investor and startup consultant, wrote Menguin its first investment check, and although relocation to Arkansas was not part of the deal, Delaney and the business’ other co-founder, Kurt Sutton, believed they could learn a lot about the business in close proximity to the surgeon-turned-entrepreneur. They took up office in James’ Hayseed Ventures space in downtown Fayetteville, and in 2015 Menguin showed a 2,000% rise in revenue, followed by another 400% in growth for 2016, Delaney said. It has six distribution centers around the country and about 20 full-time employees. Menguin now has a newly minted partnership with Target as the retailer’s first digital partner for its bridal registries, allowing the company to reach Target’s 500,000 to 600,000 gift registry participants with ads and special offers, Delaney said. He likes to go against the grain. “We try to go where people aren’t,” he said. If it’s not something he learned from James, it’s a strategy the two have in common. Delaney said James was the first to figure out how to effectively use Facebook as a marketing tool, and because of that Menguin reaped the reward of an immense amount of business during a short period. “By the time a person has a good idea and you find it out from someone else, that idea’s probably old. You have to figure out something early on to get an edge,” Delaney said. Carol Reeves, associate vice provost for entrepreneurship in the Sam M. Walton College of Business at the University of Arkansas, said “Menguin tapped into an industry that was ripe for disruption.” Initially, the founders planned to start a custom suit company. However, while the two were both earning MBAs from Kelley School of Business at Indiana University, Sutton had a bad experience renting a tux, prompting them to enlist the help of faculty to research the industry. Research showed more than 80% of customers renting tuxes or suits were dissatisfied with the experience. “That’s higher than airlines, for example,” Delaney said. Public companies in the industry showed gross margins of 80%. Delaney and Sutton saw an opportunity and decided to pivot to tuxedo rentals. They entered a business plan competition in 2014, winning $100,000 from an angel investment round of investors that included NBC’s “Shark Tank” star and the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban. Noted entrepreneur Scott Dorsey, another initial investor, became Delaney’s mentor, he said. Rick Webb, founder of Grit Studios in Rogers, also pointed to Junk Brands, a custom headband and apparel company in Bentonville, as a player to watch in the e-commerce realm. Webb said e-commerce companies can do well in Northwest Arkansas for several reasons. “A big part of it is having people who were willing mentors and subject matter experts. John James is one of those mentors that we should be proud of here,” Webb said. Grit Studios focuses on building the entrepreneurial ecosystem by helping small businesses get to the next level. • Medical Technology Webb, former senior vice president of global business processes at Wal-Mart Stores, said there is a group of healthcare technology companies in Northwest Arkansas quietly gearing up to make a global impact, and he is invested in some of these companies through NewRoad Capital Partners in Rogers. One example is Now Diagnostics in Springdale. Webb said, “It will change the world,” although he admits to possible bias tied to his personal investment. The company recently raised more than $20 million. Now Diagnostics develops fast, simple diagnostics tests and — after about four years in business — now has a few products on the market for clinical use and several in various stages of development. Commercialization in the medical device industry takes time, as the company must meet rigorous and time-consuming legal requirements. In 2016, Now Diagnostics worked toward gaining its first at-home use approval, for its hCG early-stage pregnancy blood test. It successfully completed a clinical trial and submitted to the Food & Drug Administration for a CLIA waiver — which would indicate that the test was easily administered with a low risk of errors. The company hopes to gain home-use approval for the product — now being used in clinical settings in the U.S. and Europe — in 2017. The company has three heart attack tests and three toxicology tests on the market in Europe. The development pipeline includes more cardiac tests and tests for sexually transmitted diseases, food intolerances and common infectious diseases, according to the company. There are seven patents and two patents pending on the technology inside its tests, through the World Intellectual Property Organization. CEO Kevin Clark said the biggest challenge for the company has been the decisions that come with a technology that is widely applicable. “This platform works on virtually any discernible biological marker, making it a challenge to decide which test to bring to the market first,” Clark said. Now Diagnostics has about 50 employees, about two-thirds of which are located in the company’s U.S. headquarters in Springdale, and Webb said he hopes Arkansas can keep Now Diagnostics in the state long-term. “I think it will be an incredible success for Arkansas in the next few years,” he said. Ascendant Dx, which leases space from Now Diagnostics but has no connection to the company, is also a medical technology startup with the potential to make strides toward commercialization in 2017. Its signature product is an early-stage breast cancer test that looks for markers in teardrops. The test is still in the clinical trial phase, and the company earned several honors last year, including making the finals for the social impact category at SXSW Eco and the U.S. Small Business Administration’s InnovateHER. Lineus Medical, founded by a former nurse in 2015 and based in Fayetteville, is another company to watch, Webb said. Its premier product in development, SafeBreak I.V., is used to prevent dislodging of IV catheters. • Software Engineering If you ask Reeves, a successful company often boils down to having “amazing tech, a great management team and a great market.” RevUnit in Bentonville has all three, she said. Michael Paladino and Joe Saumweber were co-workers at Rockfish Interactive, now Rockfish Digital, when they met and decided to start the software product development studio RevUnit near the end of 2012. “Everyone in town was focused on digital marketing,” Saumweber said. “We loved building digital products. Products are different. They endure for much longer than a marketing campaign, they build a relationship with the user. Done right, products are shaped more by those who use them than by those who create them. This was just a different way of thinking at the time, and it meant that we had to strike out on our own to create the mindset we envisioned.” Now, there are other operations similar to RevUnit throughout the country, Saumweber said. But they are relatively small, and the larger companies are still more focused on campaigns. In particular, RevUnit focuses on products that help companies transform its workforce, he said. “Employees of the Fortune 500 are some of the most underserved when it comes to beautiful, usable technology,” he said. “Our mission is to increase agility in large enterprises by building tools that improve communication, productivity, engagement and learning for the workforce.” With about 40 employees, mostly in Northwest Arkansas, RevUnit has nearly doubled in size each year, and Saumweber said the team wants to further that growth by beefing up its client roster, which now includes Wal-Mart Stores, Virgin, AutoZone, Toll Brothers and Purina. At the beginning of February, the company will move to a new Bentonville location at the former Farmers Exchange building at 409 S.W. A St., which is four times the size of its current, 2,300-square-foot office on Main Street. Webb has invested in RevUnit through New Roads, and praised Saumweber’s and Paladino’s “thoughtful” approach and “balanced business model.” “They started with a strong relationship with Wal-Mart but were not dependent on that relationship. Some businesses put all their eggs in one basket, and if that client decides to change its plans and part ways, the company almost has to start over,” Webb said. • High Technology Several high-tech companies have been formed in the past few years out of academic research at the UA, and Ozark Integrated Circuits is one now picking up momentum, said Jeff Amerine, founding principal of Startup Junkie Consulting, which mentors and works with entrepreneurs at companies of all sizes. Founded in 2011, Ozark IC designs “rugged” electronic circuits that can withstand harsh conditions and are used in a wide variety of industries, from consumer electronics to aerospace technology. Most computer chips are made of silicon and can only work at temperatures up to 125 degrees Celsius or 257 Fahrenheit, said Matt Francis, founder and president of the company. Ozark IC specializes in silicon-carbide circuits that can operate at temperatures as high as 500 degrees Celsius, almost 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. In 2017, Ozark IC plans to build on ongoing research grants and commercial contracts. “We’re pretty steadily having three to five projects ongoing at any one time,” Francis said, adding that he hopes the company will get close to $1 million in revenue in 2017. In terms of research contracts, 2016 was a big year for the company. It won its first Phase II research contract from NASA, totaling $755,000 over two years, as well as smaller Phase I contracts from NASA and the U.S. Air Force. The push last year was to expand its work in engine markets as well as its design and testing capabilities for circuits that could withstand the atmosphere of Venus. Ozark IC also landed commercial contracts that are now in mass production. It created an electronics design for an original equipment manufacturer and recently shipped the first 100,000 units, said Jim Holmes, chief technology officer. He did not disclose the name of the manufacturer, but said Ozark IC used its experience in low power design to make its batteries last 10 times longer than the previous model. In 2017, pending research and commercial contracts could help the company break into new markets, including clean geothermal energy, Francis said. While Holmes said hiring at Ozark IC has been “cautious and incremental” — there are eight employees at the company — it doubled in size from 2014 to 2015 and is on track to grow between 20% and 50% this year. Francis said staffing and cash flow have been the biggest challenges in the past few years, but the company’s restrained approach to hiring has paid off. “The best thing we’ve been able to do is get the right folks on board at the right times,” he said. Reeves points to several other companies that sprung from the UA’s scientific research programs and that she says are poised for success, including the early-stage businesses Little Bird Systems, which deals with the Internet of Things, WattGlass, which makes glare-free glass coatings for solar panels and lighting fixtures, and Boston Mountain Biotech, which makes technology for the pharmaceutical industry. All are neighbors of Ozark IC in the Arkansas Research and Technology Park in Fayetteville. Reeves’ entrepreneurship program has been the birthplace for all types of businesses and entrepreneurs, and Reeves regularly works with the university’s scientific researchers to connect them with business student partners in her class — “because you need both,” she said. • Last-Mile Solutions Although it did not originate in Northwest Arkansas, Chef Shuttle is an influential startup in the area and represents a major nationwide trend, last-mile solutions, which refers to a wide range of technologies and processes that connect goods and services to consumers in their homes or offices. Chef Shuttle, founded in 2014 in Little Rock, will mark its 500,000th delivered restaurant order in the coming months, said Ryan Herget, president and CEO. It now operates in 40 cities and works with more than 450 food establishments, including 50 in Northwest Arkansas, a market it entered in 2015. “We make life easier by delivering customers’ favorite foods from their favorite restaurants when they want and where they want, from the same menus and at the same prices as dine-in customers,” Herget said. The company now has 250 total staff and contracted drivers across its three markets — it also has operations in Memphis — with 50 of those employees based out of its Northwest Arkansas headquarters in Rogers. Herget said fast growth has led to some challenges, especially in keeping software and the front-facing customer experience up to date. However, the company plans to open in at least six new metro areas soon and will launch a new software program and website in 2017. Reeves stressed the importance of last-mile solutions, by calling the identification of the next big innovation “the million-dollar question.” Webb said the last mile is “the Holy Grail,” in the retail world and possibly other industries. The crux of the trend is convenience, a common thread that transcends industry in consumer expectations. Webb believes last-mile innovations will continue to gain traction, especially as transportation solutions like the ride-sharing companies Uber and Lyft broaden their business model to delivery, partnering with retailers and other companies. Last mile is something that the public — and even Webb himself admits — demands now, he said. “Customers want personalized attention,” he said. “We’re willing to tell companies more and more about who we are and what we want and how we live. And we expect them to cater their offerings to us.” Comments comments Previous post Black leaders making a difference in business, their communities Next post P.A.M. earnings decline 48% in 2016, 77% in fourth quarter Newsletter Sign up to get latest from TB&P in your inbox!

According to the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, the incident took place at approximately 8:00 on Saturday morning at a Walmart in the Orlando area. Police say Arthur Adams, 19, and another unidentified male were loading a two carts full of diapers into their car in front of the store, allegedly without having paid for them, when they were confronted by a store employee.

Police are still working to determine exactly what happened next, but  the man told police he “felt threatened” when Adams allegedly reached for something, prompting him to produce a pistol and open fire on Adams and the other male. READ MORE: Refugees brave freezing cold, walk to Canada to escape Donald Trump’s USA “The Orange County Sheriff’s Office detectives have been working with Walmart representatives and interviewing witnesses to determine the facts in the weekend shooting at the Walmart store,” Orange County Sheiff Jerry Demings said in a statement to media. “The investigation is ongoing and we ask the community not to rush to judgment.” Police say both Adams and a teenage girl who was with the two suspects were struck by the gunfire. The suspects attempted to flee in their vehicle, but proceeded on foot after their car struck two other cars in the parking lot. Police say Adams made it as far as a gas station across the street from the Walmart, where he collapsed. He was rushed to hospital where he was later pronounced dead. The teenage girl later turned herself in to police with a gunshot wound to her leg. She’s said to be in stable condition. A spokesperson for the Orange County Sherriff’s Office told Global News that the department is still working to determine why Adams was allegedly stealing just diapers. As for the customer who intervened and fatally shot Adams, police say the issue is now before the Florida State Attorney, who will determine whether charges are warranted. “The case will be presented to the State Attorney for review and appropriate charges will be determined for all involved,” Demings said. “The use of deadly force will be evaluated based on law and the right to protect one’s self or others from great bodily harm or death.” READ MORE: Donald Trump’s likeness found on heroin packets seized in Florida drug bust Police say Adams was known to them prior to Saturday’s shooting. “There have been numerous felony arrest warrants [for Adams], 15 approximately,” Capt.

Just weeks into Donald Trump’s presidency, they are getting a taste of why such attempts are always confounding—every action creates an equal and opposite reaction. A linchpin of the House Republicans’ tax plan, an approach called “border adjustment,” has split Republicans and fractured the business world into competing coalitions before a bill has even been drafted. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 68.02 -1.06 -1.53% Target Corp TGT ▼ 65.73 -0.68 -1.02% Toyota Motor Corp TM ▲ 112.89 +0.97 +0.87% General Electric Co GE ▲ 29.72 +0.13 +0.44% AdChoices A border-adjusted tax would impose a levy on imports, including components used in manufacturing, and exempt exports altogether. Opposing it are retailers, car dealers, toy manufacturers, Koch Industries Inc., oil refiners and others that say it would drive up import costs and force them to raise prices. “Every time somebody buys something at Wal-Mart or Target or fills up their car with gas, they’re going to get hit pretty hard with this thing,” says Andy Roth, vice president of government affairs at the Club for Growth, a free-market advocacy group. “I don’t think that’s what the voters signed up for in November.” The proposal’s architects, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R., Texas) and Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.), have support among House Republicans and major export-driven companies such as General Electric Co. Supporters say the House tax plan would encourage domestic investment and reward companies that manufacture in America. Border adjustment would raise short-term government revenue, many economists say, by operating like a levy on the $500 billion trade deficit. “We cannot afford to shoot for mediocre, to try to get to the middle of the pack or just do what’s politically easy,” says Mr. Brady. “Yes, I know tax reform is difficult. That’s why it only occurs once a generation.” The fire over border adjustment has landed the GOP’s tax-code overhaul drive in excruciatingly familiar territory: Nearly everyone agrees the code needs revamping, but every existing provision has its staunch defenders and every new approach its detractors. Charities are alarmed by Mr. Trump’s proposal during his campaign to cap itemized deductions at $100,000 for individuals and $200,000 for married couples. Private-equity managers are worried by the House proposal to end the deduction for net business-interest costs. The real-estate industry and state governments have big concerns, too. Mr. Brady says he is listening to objections and looking at ways to smooth the transition for taxpayers. Still, “we are going bold because we have to,” he says. “We don’t have a choice. We’ve got to get back into the lead pack to become competitive again, and so that means shaking up the current tax code.” There is plenty in the broader House GOP plan for Messrs. Brady and Ryan to pitch to businesses and lawmakers, including lower rates and immediate deductions for capital expenses. Border adjustment is a pillar of the plan, however, and the fight over it is dominating the broader debate, a preview of months of skirmishes over every corner of the tax bill. Last week, GE, Dow Chemical Co. and Pfizer Inc. joined a coalition backing border adjustment that says the proposal would help end disadvantages for American-made products. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp., Nike Inc. and Toyota Motor Corp. joined an opposing coalition, warning that border adjustment will cause consumer price increases. Rep. David Schweikert (R., Ariz.) got a Ways and Means Committee seat in January and quickly found himself staying up late reading competing reports on the proposed tax change and hearing from businesses that barely communicated with him before. “I have a lot of new friends,” he says. Mr. Trump initially labeled the idea “too complicated” and said he didn’t like the term. “Any time I hear ‘border adjustment,’ I don’t love it,” Mr. Trump said in a Jan. 13 interview with The Wall Street Journal. He has called for a “big border tax” that narrowly targets companies that outsource production for goods sold in the U.S. The White House appeared to embrace border adjustment as a way to draw money from Mexico, only to back away and say it is one option. It didn’t respond to requests for comment for this article. What isn’t in doubt is the GOP’s intention to seize the moment. “The chances of tax reform occurring are the best we’ve seen in 30 years,” says former Rep. Dave Camp, a Republican whose tax-code overhaul attempt essentially died the day he unveiled it in 2014, thanks to divisions inside the GOP. Republicans plan to turn in earnest to tax policy after passing health legislation this year. Although plans for quick action on repealing the Affordable Care Act have been slipping, they still want to make tax overhaul a signature 2017 project. House Republicans want to drop the top individual tax rate to a 25-year low, cut the corporate tax rate to the lowest since 1939 and kill the 101-year-old estate tax. Those are the politically easy choices, the ones Republicans argue would boost economic growth and simplify taxes. If that is all they sought, they could copy their 2001 playbook, push through tax cuts with a 10-year expiration date and declare victory. Mr. Brady says Republicans won’t do that. They are rethinking fundamental tax rules for businesses and individuals, trying to improve investment incentives and remove tax provisions they say distort economic choices. That would affect every industry and income group, inevitably creating winners and losers. “If you make your living off of some special deal in the current income-tax system, you’re not going to like it,” says Rep. Devin Nunes (R., Calif.), a senior Ways and Means member. “But most Americans don’t make their living off of benefits in the tax code, and they want the tax code simplified.” To avoid blowing a giant hole in the federal budget, House members plan to offset the rate cuts with provisions that would be large tax increases if considered on their own. The Republicans’ task is harder than in 1986, when they worked with Democrats to scrub the tax code. This time, many Democrats are poised to dismiss the GOP plans as unacceptable tax cuts for rich individuals tied to untested changes for businesses. A memo from Senate Democratic tax staffers in December called the House plan “highly regressive and fiscally irresponsible.” “We’re seeing these proposals being depicted as having near perfection and the opponents saying it’s fiscal Armageddon,” says Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on Ways and Means. “My hunch is that’s where substantive hearings over a long period of time could be very helpful.” Mr. Brady and his staff are still writing their plan, and there are many details to figure out. Generally, here’s how border adjustment would work: Companies wouldn’t be able to deduct import costs as regular business expenses anymore. Target, say, couldn’t deduct the cost of toys made in China and McCormick & Co. couldn’t deduct for spices it buys abroad. Both have expressed concerns about border adjustment. On the flip side, exports and other foreign sales wouldn’t count as income, meaning the U.S. would stop taxing its companies’ foreign revenue and profits. When GE, which backs border adjustment, sells a turbine in Indonesia, it wouldn’t have to pay a U.S. tax on the sale, no matter where the product is made. Those changes would reshape the corporate tax system so the U.S. would tax only goods and services used in the country. One advantage is that it would tax something that doesn’t move—consumption in America—instead of something that is fungible, such as the location of corporate profits. The House plan would lower the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%. Border adjustment would generate about $1 trillion in tax revenue over a decade to help pay for that, according to independent estimates. It would also transform the business-tax system so companies selling goods and services in the U.S. largely couldn’t escape taxes by putting their addresses, intellectual property or jobs outside America in low-tax countries, a problem the Obama administration tried to tamp down. The argument for border adjustment hinges in part on how currency markets will respond. Economists expect border adjustment to increase the dollar’s value as much as 25%, citing similar currency moves when other nations introduced border-adjusted value-added taxes. As a result, proponents say, an importer would pay more taxes but the stronger dollar would make it cheaper to bring products into the U.S., theoretically leaving the importer no worse off. Exporters could be hit by a stronger dollar—it would make their products more expensive in foreign currencies—but benefit from lower tax bills. Some retailers and other big importers doubt the dollar would rise that much. They warn of tax bills that would exceed profits, forcing them to pass costs to consumers. Some are in the early stages of working on an alternative plan they can present to lawmakers, says a person familiar with those plans. Cody Lusk, president of the American International Automobile Dealers Association, says his members are shocked that a Republican Congress is proposing a 20% tax on imports. “We view this as a very, very serious potential blow to the auto sector and the economy,” says Mr. Lusk, whose members sell Toyotas, Hondas and other cars from foreign-headquartered companies. He likes aspects of the House plan, “but when we look at the whole, I don’t think the juice is worth the squeeze.” Tax experts are puzzling over how to describe who wins and loses from border adjustment. One thing is clear, economists say: If the dollar goes up 25%, U.S. holders of foreign assets—including pension funds and endowments—would suffer a one-time loss in wealth of more than $2 trillion. There is also global uncertainty: Other countries may retaliate, either by border-adjusting their corporate taxes or by challenging the U.S. plan at the World Trade Organization as too tilted toward American producers. Border adjustment is essential in value-added tax systems around the world, but no country has done precisely what the House GOP is proposing. A panel President George W. Bush convened in 2005 suggested border adjustment. So did a 2008 plan from Mr. Ryan. Mr. Brady turned to border adjustment last year. That approach solved some problems that blocked Mr. Camp’s plan but now is causing its own. Every chip away at unanimity makes tax overhaul tougher. Rep. Pat Tiberi (R., Ohio), a senior Ways and Means member, says some of his constituents back border adjustment while others are worried. He says Cardinal Health Inc. has voiced concerns about the cost of rubber for latex gloves and Honda Motor Co. has raised objections, too. Cardinal declined to comment. Honda says it is concerned about the impact on prices. Rep. Pat Meehan (R., Pa.), says refiners in his district rely on imported oil and that he is arguing for an exception. “It puts us at a remarkable competitive disadvantage,” he says. Republicans have said they are considering pushing a tax plan through the Senate by a simple majority. With a 52-48 Senate margin, they have little maneuvering room. At least seven GOP senators have expressed concerns about border adjustment, including Utah’s Mike Lee, Arkansas’s John Boozman, Georgia’s David Perdue and Texas’ John Cornyn. Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) said last week he had questions about border adjustment and that the Senate would put its own stamp on the tax bill. “I worry that consumers, my Kansas constituents, are the ones who pay the tax,” says Sen. Jerry Moran (R., Kan.). He is concerned the world might respond in ways that hurt his state’s wheat growers and airplane makers. “I assume you get into a battle with other countries,” he says, “and it affects the exporters.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

 Walmart ups stake in JD.com BI Intelligence Feb. 7, 2017, 12:11 PM 1,027 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also RETAIL FORECAST: U.S. consumers will spend $632 billion online by 2020 Amazon accounts for 43% of US online retail sales THE REVERSE LOGISTICS REPORT: How retailers can save money by making returns smoother in the e-commerce age This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "E-Commerce Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Late last week, Walmart announced that it had increased its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com to 12.1%, worth roughly $4.87 billion. This is up from the 10.8% stake it had in October, and its 5.9% stake in June of last year. Two distinct developments led Walmart to increase its stake in JD.com: Rising wages and income in China. Inflation in China remains under 2%, while wages have been increasing by 8-9% over the last few years, according to data cited by Forbes. Rising wages leads to higher disposable income and increased spending. Walmart is putting faith in JD.com to remain one of the top players in China’s e-commerce space, where consumers are projected to spend nearly $6.4 trillion a year by 2025. JD.com is in full-fledged growth mode, increasing revenue, gross merchandise volume (GMV), and delivery methods to reach underserved markets. Total net revenue for JD.com grew 38% YoY, totaling over $9 billion in Q3 2016. Meanwhile, total GMV saw an impressive 43% jump YoY in Q3 to nearly $24 billion. On the innovation front, the company is expanding its drone delivery routes to cut transportation costs and increase focus on rural areas of China, which will ultimately help it compete against Chinese e-commerce market leader Alibaba. As it increases its competitive position, that could help boost Walmart by allowing it to leverage an existing platform. Walmart appears intent to expand in China’s e-commerce market as an investor, rather than through its own operations. In fact, Walmart plans to shut down its own e-commerce mobile app in China in favor of highlighting JD.com’s global flagship store in China. JD.com will also serve as the online shopping platform for over 20 Walmart stores across China in the near future. E-commerce has been on the rise in the last several years, thanks in large part to titans in the industry such as Amazon and Alibaba. E-commerce will truly become the future of retail, as nearly all of the growth in the retail sector now takes place in the digital space. BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, forecasts that U.S. consumers will spend $385 billion online in 2016. Moreover, BI Intelligence predicts that number will grow to $632 billion in 2020. This is hardly surprising considering e-commerce's healthy growth. Though the U.S. retail average growth rate in the first half of 2016 was just 2% for total retail, it was 16% for e-commerce. The number of online shoppers has grown by nearly 20 million from 2015 to 2016. And these 224 million shoppers are spending more, as the total amount spent online grew from $61 billion in the first quarter of 2015 to $68 billion in Q1 2016. Finally, these customers are transacting more frequently, as the number of online transactions has risen by 115 million from 2015 to 2016. But all of this shopping online creates its own set of challenges, both for consumers and the companies that are trying to get their products onto shoppers' screens and into their shopping carts. In short, you need a plan. And to create your ultimate e-commerce battle plan, you need the right intel. BI Intelligence is here to help.

Edward Hardy Feb 7, 2017 6:32 AM EST Walmart  (WMT) continued to lose ground in the U.K. as low-cost competitors gained steam, according to data from Kantar Worldpanel released on Tuesday. Sales at Walmart's U.K. unit, Asda, fell 1.9% to £4.3 billion ($5.3 billion) for the 12 weeks to Jan. 29, making it the only grocery store to experience a decline. Asda, which has 630 locations across the U.K., saw its market share drop 0.6 percentage points to 15.6%.   Asda's decline has started to slow, with Kantar Worldpanel noting the retailer managed to increase the number of shoppers visiting stores compared to the same time period last year.

Comments aAFont Size About 8th Street Market Ten acres along Eighth Street in the Bentonville Market District near the Bentonville square will ultimately showcase culinary education, music and the arts, restaurants and hospitality venues, and other specialized food and drink concepts. The Northwest Arkansas Community College expanded culinary arts and hospitality program Brightwater operates at the site. Bentonville-based Bike Rack Brewery announced it will open an 8,000-foot facility at the site that will feature and teach the full production brewing process, as well as sell beer brewed on site. Source: Octagon Events and Hospitality BENTONVILLE -- The Bite NW Arkansas food festival will have a new home this year. The event, part of the LPGA's Walmart NW Arkansas Championship presented by P&G, will be held June 22-23 at 8th Street Market in Bentonville. The Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion in Rogers hosted the first two years of the event, which were sold out. The 11th annual golf tournament runs June 19-25 at Pinnacle Country Club in Rogers. "The LPGA [the NW Arkansas Championship] is such a regional event, it really impacts all of Northwest Arkansas," said Dana Davis, president and CEO of the Greater Bentonville Area Chamber of Commerce. "With 8th Street Market becoming a foodie destination, and when you think of the businesses that are going to be there and the culinary things they're trying to do, it makes sense to hold [Bite] at that site." The format of the two-day food festival will be the same as in previous years, comprised of Taste of NW Arkansas, a traditional restaurant showcase, on the first night and the Burgers and Beer Fest on the second. The festival will coincide with the opening of 8th Street Market, a 10-acre location designed for culinary education, restaurants, entertainment and hospitality at 801 SE Eighth St., between E and J streets, approximately one mile from the downtown square. Northwest Arkansas Community College's program Brightwater: A Center for the Study of Food operates out of the location, but the remainder of the facility will not open to the public until summer. "As we look to the next 10 years, the vision is to expand into the greater Northwest Arkansas community," said Harry Hardy, event director. "The timing works out perfectly, almost too good to be true. We're excited to have a new home for Bite." The venue was a natural fit for the festival because it was built with culinary purposes in mind and offers the cold storage and equipment necessary for it, Hardy said. The ability to host events indoor and outdoors, as well as its close proximity to the trail system were added benefits. "Visit Bentonville and the city of Bentonville are very culinary focused, it's a key part of our image," said Kalene Griffith, president and CEO of Visit Bentonville. "Culinary is its own attraction -- an integral part of the tourist experience -- and having the festival is a huge bonus. It takes a regional effort, but we all benefit [from it]." More than 35 restaurants and 15 area breweries participated in 2016 Bite NW Arkansas, which served 2,000 people. Most of the same vendors and chefs, such as Tyson Director of Research and Development Culinary Services Mario Valdovino, will return alongside a few new faces, Hardy said. The goal is to attract 3,000 ticket holders. Bike Rack Brewery in Bentonville will be among the vendors inside the 8th Street Market. Beer will be brewed on site at Bike Rack's 8,000-square-foot facility that will feature a tap room with capacity for 90 people. Bike Rack Brewery also has its original location at 401 SW A St., Suite 6. "We are ecstatic that Bite NW Arkansas is moving to 8th Street Market and that our brewery will have the chance to help grow the impact of the event," Jeff Charlson, CEO and partner of Bike Rack Brewing Company, said in a news release. "For two years, Bite has paired great food with great beer. That's authentic to the mission of Bike Rack and what I think we can expect to see at 8th Street Market in the long term." Festival ticket prices will remain the same as 2016 -- $50 per couple, $30 for individuals, and will go on sale March 1. "People think it's a really cool event, and we work hard to create an atmosphere about the community -- once you buy a ticket, you don't have to get your wallet out again," Hardy said. "That's the beauty of it, bringing restaurants from the whole region to one place." The festival venue change will allow Brightwater to showcase its new culinary facilities and capabilities through hands-on cooking demonstrations. "Given all the culinary and hospitality growth throughout Northwest Arkansas, Bite NW Arkansas is a great way to help introduce 8th Street Market and Brightwater," Glenn Mack, executive director of Brightwater, said in a news release. "Brightwater and our students have been a part of Bite from its inception and now that we share the site, I'm sure our engagement will only grow in the future."

On Friday the retail giant called The Mardrian Group (TMG), telling the firm Walmart is choosing to focus efforts on adding 30 new stores and updating existing locations, and west Louisville is not in those plans. The 18-acre property at the corner of Broadway and 18th Street was purchased by New Bridge Development in 2006, and the recession stalled plans. Despite a lawsuit challenging the Metro Planning Commission’s approval and thousands of signatures in support of the store, Walmart initially passed in October, but the development firm tried one more time. TMG says original plans before Walmart are now back on the table, which includes a mix-use development with retail, restaurants and possibly residential. “I know there is a huge need for affordable housing in west Louisville, so we will consider that as part of the development,” said Teresa Bridgewaters, President of TMG. Business owners who work across the street from the vacant lot are hoping the property can be a mix of local and national stores and chains. “What can we put down here that we all need? Not just us but all of us – the whole city of Louisville,” said Michael Laws, who owns Fade Away Barbershop TMG says they have no contracts signed at a new location, but if a large enough anchor store wants to build, that could shrink plans for the original mix-use draft. The development firm says they are currently talking with Meijer, Target and Kroger.

The retailer says it will reduce shipping time to two days on 2 million of its most popular items including essentials like diapers and pet food as well as hot toys and electronics. Wal-Mart's average shipping time has been three to five days. Starting Tuesday, it's also reducing the spending necessary for free shipping to $35 from $50. Wal-Mart's ShippingPass, launched as a pilot program in the summer of 2015, was aimed at challenging Amazon Prime and had allowed members to buy more than a million items for free shipping at Walmart.com. Last year, it trimmed its shipping time to two days from three, and cut the annual fee by a dollar to $49. Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart said it worked well, but the company concluded shoppers shouldn't have to pay a membership fee for free shipping. The strategy shift is one of the first big moves by Walmart.com's CEO Mark Lore, who joined the company when Wal-Mart bought online retailer Jet.com last year. And it's an illustration of how Wal-Mart is trying to figure out a way to compete with Amazon and its dominant Prime plan. But some analysts say the approach may not be sufficiently aggressive to compete with Amazon Prime. They believe Wal-Mart — which also has encouraged shoppers to collect their online orders from stores to avoid shipping costs — should get rid of any minimum required for free shipping. "They should eliminate the threshold altogether, said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics LLC. "I know it's a difficult pill to swallow. But if you look at how things are going, click-and-pick is never going to be as popular as click-and-ship." Amazon's membership program costs $99 a year, but includes services like streaming music and video that have created fierce loyalty. Analysts say Amazon Prime members buy more frequently and spend more money. Amazon doesn't disclose a Prime subscriber total, but it's estimated to be around 65 million. Wal-Mart wouldn't say how many ShippingPass subscribers it had, but all will receive a refund of their membership fee. Lore declined to comment on Amazon, but said lower prices, a wider assortment of eligible goods and faster shipping alone can build loyalty. Lore promised more moves ahead to spur Wal-Mart's online business. "Two-day, free shipping is table stakes," he said in a conference call Monday. "We've upped the ante. On a very fundamental level, we don't have to charge for membership. We can save customers both time and money." Lore said he believes the new approach will dramatically increase sales. Wal-Mart's online sales had been slowing over the past two years, but notably accelerated during last year's third quarter. Wal-Mart reports fourth-quarter results next month. Wal-Mart said purchases outside the 2 million most popular items will count toward free shipping, but won't get the faster delivery. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Answer Is Simple – Customers By Nihat Arkan — November 30, 2016 In a year of many major acquisitions, one of the most interesting has been that of Jet.com by Walmart. Jet emerged on the scene just two years ago and quickly earned a spot as a recognized ecommerce player. With a business model built on innovative dynamic pricing, Jet’s success largely came from the company’s low-cost initiatives. Enter Walmart. Although the retailer has also made a name for itself with low prices, that’s where the similarities between Walmart and Jet end. The companies may have played the same game, but each employed a strikingly different business model. Is integration possible? Or did Walmart acquire Jet for a different reason? It’s likely that Walmart was motivated to partner with Jet in order to gain access to a whole new set of consumers. There’s no denying that Walmart owns the brick-and-mortar space. Most people in the U.S. live within 15 minutes of a Walmart, and the average Walmart Supercenter retails 140,000 items. That said, Walmart has struggled to bridge the digital gap and constantly loses customers to major ecommerce players like Amazon. According to recent research, the average Walmart shopper is a 50-year old female living  in a household with an annual income of $53,125. This is great for in-store shopping, but it misses the mark in today's dropship model of commerce when it comes to engaging digital consumers, many of whom are turning to smartphones and computers to make smaller purchases more often. Walmart has been very transparent about its intention of attracting urban, millennial shoppers via Jet. In the race against Amazon (let’s be honest, everyone is racing Amazon these days), it makes more sense for big-box retailers like Walmart to acquire companies that have mature ecommerce capabilities rather than overcoming decades of highly entrenched brick-and-mortar operations and processes. Bringing on another company instead of reinventing its entire digital business model allows Walmart to gain market share online while still maintaining the upper hand for in-store sales. Full integration with Jet’s dynamic pricing model will place many new demands on Walmart’s unparalleled supply chain operations. This will add major complexities to its product information management systems, warehouses and shipping logistics systems -- namely, Walmart will need a stronger digital content strategy to handle omnichannel sales across a larger, more diverse consumer pool. Likewise, product information will need to be more robust and accurate in order to supplement the tactile touch points brands and retailers lose when going from selling in store to online. While a strategic ecommerce business model like this is likely a goal for Wal-Mart long term, its acquisition of Jet is a smart move in the interim. And, really, there’s little rush for Walmart to integrate with Jet. Today, Wal-Mart’s top priority should be leveraging Jet to reach new customers and establish strong relationship with them online. This leaves ample room for both retailers to pursue differentiated business models and reach a wider pool of consumers. For now at least, the biggest strength of Walmart’s acquisition of Jet may not be coming together, but rather staying separate.

How Did Javi React? TV 0 0 0 February 6, 2017 ‘Teen Mom’ Star Kailyn Lowry Caught With Another Man! How Did Javi React? Perry Carpenter Kailyn Lowry’s drama with Javi Marroquin heated up on the latest episode of Teen Mom 2. Things got super awkward when Marroquin unexpectedly walked in on Lowry leaving her house with another man! Lowry refused to comment on camera, but he has since opened up about the incident. In an interview with Radar Online, a source close to Lowry explained how she tried to avoid the situation altogether. Unfortunately, Marroquin arrived early to pick up the kids and threw Lowry’s plans out the window. “Kail was home trying to leave to go to Walmart,” an insider shared. “They had an agreement that at 5:00 he was to come pick up his stuff by himself and drop Lincoln off. It was 4:00 when she was trying to leave. That was within minutes of Kail telling Javi she was leaving for Walmart.” Lowry also violated the agreement by bringing Peach and Darius with him to the house. The estranged couple had previously agreed that only Marroquin was allowed in the home. Although Lowry was with another man, the source claims that nothing romantic was happening. “The guy in the episode has been Kail’s friend for years, Javi acted like he walked in on something romantic between those two, but he didn’t,” the source explained. “They’ve been friends for a few years and tried to see their potential romantically. They are still together.” At the time of the incident, Lowry refused to comment. According to the Stir, Lowry didn’t discuss the matter because she was tired of talking about their split on the show. love my boys so much ❤️❤️ A photo posted by Kailyn Lowry (@kaillowry) on Feb 5, 2017 at 10:43am PST “There’s so much that was left out. But throwing him under the bus doesn’t solve anything,” the insider added. “I’m going to bite the bullet on this one. The truth will eventually reveal itself.” Of course, none of that stopped Marroquin from airing his grievances on Teen Mom 2. Although the cameras didn’t capture the fight, Marroquin revealed what happened behind closed doors. “I texted her and said can I drop Lincoln off and she was like, ‘I’m at Walmart right now come in an hour,'” he stated. “We pull up earlier since Kail’s car was there and we see another car. I knock on the door, Lincoln goes in and I said, ‘Let me get my stuff’ and she won’t let me in. I’m like I’m not leaving my son with another dude here, not happening.” Marroquin continued, “How disrespectful are you? You’re going to disrespect me and chill with some dude? I came home, I didn’t even go to my own house, I came to a hotel. I don’t know what’s going on in her head.” @evamarcille is killing it tonight. She makes me look better ???????? everyone check out @firstaveeyewear A photo posted by Javi Marroquin (@javim9) on Jan 12, 2017 at 7:01pm PST Sadly, the couple’s 7-year-old-son took the brunt of the fight. The Hollywood Gossip reports that Isaac expressed his frustrations with Lowry’s ex, Jo Rivera, after her fight with Marroquin. “Mom and Javi were fighting. I wasn’t okay,” Isaac told his father. “It’s not fair because do you know what my mom is doing? My mom is saying I can’t come with Javi to see his new house and he can bring Lincoln. It’s not fair.” Radar Online reports that Rivera assured Isaac that he would talk to Lowry about the situation. “I’m going to speak to your mom,” he said. “She’s a little upset. A lot of things are happening right now and it’s stressful and confusing. They might fight every now and then, but everything is going to work out and be okay.” While Lowry deals with all the drama with Marroquin, In Touch Weekly reports that she is currently gearing up for a special interview with Teen Mom 2 producers, titled “100 Things.” Lowry is expected to open up about her split with Marroquin, but it isn’t clear how much she is prepared to reveal. New episodes of Teen Mom 2 air Monday nights on MTV.

Police arrested Sebastian Erazo, 49, and Raul Rivera, 57, on Friday at 4 p.m. after an investigation. According to a police report filed in Framingham District Court, Walmart’s asset protection manager called police on Jan. 24 to report the thefts. Both men worked as cashiers in the store. The two men would take turns ringing each other in, but instead of ringing the items in, they would void the item and they’d leave without paying. Items stolen by the two men included tablets, Playstation game systems, controllers and a sofa cushion, police wrote in the report. Between Nov. 25 and Jan. 13, the pair stole nearly $1,400 worth of items, police wrote. “It is possible they had started prior to Nov. 25,” police wrote. Walmart security is still reviewing video and receipts to see if the two men had been conducting the scam prior to Nov. 25, police wrote. Police charged both Erazo, of 48B Beaver Park Road, and Rivera, of 10 Greenview St., with larceny of more than $250 by a single scheme and conspiracy to commit a crime. At the two men’s Framingham District Court arraignments on Monday, Judge Jennifer Stark released them without bail. They are both due back in court next month for pretrial conferences.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 February 2017 by Military News Wal-Mart Tried to Take on Amazon Prime and Failed Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) doesn’t think it makes sense to charge its online customers for two-day shipping anymore. The retailer is shutting down its year-and-a-half old ShippingPass program, a $50-per-year two-day shipping service similar to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime. “In today’s world of e-commerce, two-day free shipping is table stakes,” Marc Lore, head of Wal-Mart U.S. e-commerce wrote in an announcement. Wal-Mart is trying to spin the move as a positive, but it’s simply masking the fact that it tried to take on Amazon Prime and failed. Prime is one of the three pillars of Amazon, and its membership drives astounding loyalty. Wal-Mart was looking for a similar effect with ShippingPass. Instead, it’s moving down market, reducing the threshold for free shipping to $35 from $49, and promising to get some 2 million items to customers in just a couple days. Wal-Mart can’t compete Both Amazon and Wal-Mart boast huge marketplaces that bring together thousands of merchants on their online platforms. But where Wal-Mart falls short is that it’s heavily reliant on its third-party merchants to fulfill online orders themselves. In fact, just 2 million items qualify for two-day shipping. By comparison, Amazon’s marketplace has over 50 million Prime-eligible items. That’s thanks to its Fulfilled by Amazon service where merchants send inventory to Amazon’s warehouses, and Amazon handles shipping individual items to customers. In other words, Wal-Mart’s two-day shipping service was half-baked compared to Amazon’s. Customers who signed up for the free trial were likely disappointed at the lack of product selection, and didn’t pay up for the service. Wal-Mart won’t tear customers away from Prime By offering free two-day shipping to everyone, Wal-Mart isn’t trying to get Prime members to ditch Amazon (at least it shouldn’t be). Instead, its strategy seems to be to prevent customers from ever signing up for it in the first place. Prime members are extremely loyal and have an extremely low churn rate , so that’s about the best Wal-Mart can hope for. It’s a bit late to the game, however, considering Amazon has already signed up around half of the households in the U.S. In the last year alone, Amazon added “tens of millions” of new members. If Wal-Mart stands any chance of competing with Amazon, it needs to leverage its physical stores . That’s exactly what its new shipping program does. Items qualifying for two-day shipping are usually available in local stores already, meaning Wal-Mart only needs to ship it the last mile to a shoppers home. While free two-day shipping for everyone may win Wal-Mart a few one-off purchases, it won’t cut into the loyal and growing Amazon Prime customer base. The best it can hope for is to establish its online portals as top of mind for online shoppers. That’s one of the biggest hurdles for Wal-Mart or any online retailer to overcome. Amazon currently dominates mindshare. Fifty-five percent of online product searches start on its website, according to a survey from BloomReach last Fall. If Wal-Mart’s new shipping policy can help it grab some of those product searches, it ought to be considered a win even if its attempt to take on Amazon Prime failed. 10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart Stores When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) Feb 6, 2017 at 1:25PM Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) doesn't think it makes sense to charge its online customers for two-day shipping anymore. The retailer is shutting down its year-and-a-half-old ShippingPass program, a $50-per-year two-day shipping service similar to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime. "In today's world of e-commerce, two-day free shipping is table stakes," Marc Lore, head of Wal-Mart U.S. e-commerce wrote in an announcement. Wal-Mart is trying to spin the move as a positive, but it's simply masking the fact that it tried to take on Amazon Prime and failed. Prime is one of the three pillars of Amazon, and its membership drives astounding loyalty. Wal-Mart was looking for a similar effect with ShippingPass. Instead, it's moving down market, reducing the threshold for free shipping to $35 from $49 and promising to get some 2 million items to customers in just a couple of days. Wal-Mart can't compete Both Amazon and Wal-Mart boast huge marketplaces that bring together thousands of merchants on their online platforms. But where Wal-Mart falls short is that it's heavily reliant on its third-party merchants to fulfill online orders themselves. In fact, just 2 million items qualify for two-day shipping. By comparison, Amazon's marketplace has over 50 million Prime-eligible items. That's thanks to its Fulfilled by Amazon service where merchants send inventory to Amazon's warehouses, and Amazon handles shipping individual items to customers. In other words, Wal-Mart's two-day shipping service was half-baked compared to Amazon's. Customers who signed up for the free trial were likely disappointed at the lack of product selection, and didn't pay up for the service. Wal-Mart won't tear customers away from Prime By offering free two-day shipping to everyone, Wal-Mart isn't trying to get Prime members to ditch Amazon (at least it shouldn't be). Instead, its strategy seems to be to prevent customers from ever signing up for it in the first place. Prime members are extremely loyal and have an extremely low churn rate, so that's about the best Wal-Mart can hope for. It's a bit late to the game, however, considering Amazon has already signed up around half of the households in the U.S. In the last year alone, Amazon added "tens of millions" of new members. If Wal-Mart stands any chance of competing with Amazon, it needs to leverage its physical stores. That's exactly what its new shipping program does. Items qualifying for two-day shipping are usually available in local stores already, meaning Wal-Mart only needs to ship it the last mile to a shoppers home. While free two-day shipping for everyone may win Wal-Mart a few one-off purchases, it won't cut into the loyal and growing Amazon Prime customer base. The best it can hope for is to establish its online portals as top of mind for online shoppers. That's one of the biggest hurdles for Wal-Mart or any online retailer to overcome. Amazon currently dominates mindshare. Fifty-five percent of online product searches start on its website, according to a survey from BloomReach last Fall. If Wal-Mart's new shipping policy can help it grab some of those product searches, it ought to be considered a win even if its attempt to take on Amazon Prime failed.

Kylar Barnes, 18, and Yolanda Jensen, 31, both of Idaho Falls, were taken into custody and booked into the Madison County Jail on several charges. Barnes, Jensen and another woman were inside Walmart around 9 p.m. when they filled up two shopping carts, Rexburg Police Capt. Randy Lewis says. Barnes was leaving the store when Walmart security approached him. “He had around $350 of stuff in his cart, and Yolanda was right behind him with another shopping cart full of stuff,” Lewis tells EastIdahoNews.com. “When she saw security approach Kylar, she took off with her friend and left the cart sitting there.” Detectives learned Barnes had a magnetic device that deactivated store security tags, according to Lewis. Officers tracked down Jensen at her home and learned she had previously been removed from Walmart. Lewis says they also discovered stolen alcohol and other items. Jensen also had a warrant for her arrest out of Bonneville County. Police say Barnes and Jensen visited Albertsons twice during that same day and stole a variety of items, including alcohol. Barnes was arrested on two felony burglary charges, a felony criminal conspiracy charge and a misdemeanor possession of burglarious instrument charge. Jensen was arrested on a felony burglary charge, a felony criminal conspiracy charge and several misdemeanor charges. Barnes and Jensen were scheduled for their first court appearance Monday.

"Following" : "Follow"}} February 06, 2017 10:14am   Comments Share: This article was originally published by DriveWealth. This week, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) e-commerce chief Marc Lore announced, “it no longer makes sense for Wal-Mart to charge for two-day shipping” and that America’s largest retailer will soon be ending its “ShippingPass” delivery subscription plan in favor of a new plan. Okay, sure. No big deal, right? Until we realize that Wal-Mart’s ShippingPass plan was just announced last June. In essence, whatever “made sense” 7 months ago (when ShippingPass was announced) doesn’t make sense now. Seems like a pretty quick change now, doesn’t it? Can you guess why Wal-Mart would go back on its initiative so quickly? If not, don’t worry – we’ll explain. If we had titled this article “Wal-Mart vs. Amazon: The Battle Continues,” you may have had a much better idea. The real culprit here is not that Wal-Mart’s shipping plan “doesn’t make sense” for Wal-Mart anymore, but that Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) shipping plan – Amazon Prime, you may have heard of it – is working way better. What do we know from this, then? If it “doesn’t make sense” for Amazon these days, it may not make sense for Wal-Mart either – competition is fierce. Why? Let’s dig deeper. You may have heard by now – or at least gathered this from the beginning of this article – that there’s a long-standing battle for the future of global retail sales, with both Wal-Mart and Amazon at the head of it. And, if you think about it, while both companies have extremely different business models, they are indeed working towards the same goal. Wal-Mart, which made its great rise to the head of the American retail industry after its opening in 1962, has been most successful and is best known for its giant, all-inclusive retail stores. On the other hand, Amazon, which began in 1994, is of a different age – the age of digital retail. In other words, Amazon is known best for selling a huge variety of products – including retail items, groceries, eBooks, video streaming subscriptions and basically anything you could ever need – online. While both of these retailers are known for their low prices and amazing product variety, the avenue used to obtain their products is largely what sets the two corporations apart. But, that avenue isn’t the most important factor here – the market is. Wal-Mart and Amazon have grown over time, they have begun providing virtually the same products at very comparable prices and are therefore starting to compete in the same markets. As these two retail giants gradually merge into the same market, so begins the race to become the one all-encompassing retail chain of the future. In this race, we’re starting to see a lot of copycatting going on lately. And it’s starting to confuse us all. So, when Wal-Mart announced this week that it would be terminating its ShippingPass program for something that drastically undercuts Amazon’s shipping plan, we were a little confused, maybe, but not surprised. ShippingPass was a service that, for the past 7 months, had been Wal-Mart’s retaliation to the already-very-popular Amazon Prime. For a monthly subscription fee – similar to that of Amazon’s $99/year subscription plan – Wal-Mart had offered its users free two-day shipping among other benefits. But, as Wal-Mart realized it couldn’t stack up to Amazon Prime’s existing popularity or delivery speed, Wal-Mart has given up on the subscription model. Instead, the retailer will now simply be providing free two-day shipping on 2 million items. Free! If that isn’t the biggest challenge to Amazon’s $99/year subscription plan (whose most significant benefit for many users is fast shipping), let us know what is. We’ll wait. In other words, the battle for the shared market continues. Could this be a sign that Wal-Mart is really fueling up to take on Amazon Prime – and, thus, Amazon’s most significant market share – this time? Or a sign that Wal-Mart is simply realizing the power of Amazon and taking a loss on its subscription-based income, just to create even slight competition in Amazon’s online market? We’re not quite sure, but investors’ reactions to the announcement signified the latter, as Wal-Mart stock sunk later into the week. However, it will definitely be interesting to see how this battle plays out and how investors continue to react. As investors yourselves, you might consider looking into Wal-Mart’s new online shipping plan as well as reading its reviews. Keeping current with major business developments could definitely provide insight into the future of the company, and into Amazon’s future, too.

The unidentified man was attempting to load the stolen items into a vehicle with three other suspects around 8 a.m. Saturday, sheriff's office spokesman Capt. Angelo Nieves said. A Walmart employee attempted to stop them and then a customer "assisted" the employee, Nieves said. During the "commotion," the customer shot one suspect multiple times. "What we have at this point is that the individual felt threatened -- one of the suspects reached for something [and he] thought that it was a weapon or firearm," Nieves told the Orlando Sentinel. "The individual who was assisting the [employee] was armed and used that weapon to fire on the suspect." The suspects fled in a red vehicle, which was found to have been stolen in a Jan. 14 carjacking. The car then smashed into two parked cars in the Walmart parking lot, and suspects ran from the scene. By the time deputies arrived, the three suspects were gone. The injured suspect ran into a gas station. Orange County Fire Rescue medics then took the man to Orlando Regional Medical Center for treatment but he died. The customer who shot the suspect was not named and the sheriff's office will decide whether charges are warranted. According to FBI statistics in 2015, 268 of 9,616 criminal gun homicides were deemed justifiable by private citizens. FBI defines a justifiable homicide as "the killing of a felon, during the commission of a felony, by a private citizen." Another 60 cases of justifiable homicides involved weapons other than guns, including knives.

The deadly incident reportedly took place in the parking lot of the Pine Hills Walmart, and the armed bystander was a Walmart shopper who told investigators that he was in fear for his life when the shooting occurred.

According to WREG 3, witnesses to the so-called “diaper heist” claim that four individuals walked out of the Florida Walmart with “shopping cart-fulls” of baby diapers and “other items” that hadn’t been paid for. They then attempted to load the stolen items into a red vehicle. A Walmart employee reportedly followed the four people, including the alleged diaper thief who ultimately lost his life in the incident, to their getaway car. The Walmart employee is said to have confronted the group about the stolen property; it was then that the armed bystander came to the employee’s aid. An altercation between the alleged diaper thieves, the Walmart employee, and the armed bystander reportedly ensued as the Walmart employee and bystander confronted each other. At some point, according to the bystander, he feared for his life. He claimed that one of the alleged shoplifters reached for something that the armed bystander thought could have been a weapon. So, according to witnesses, the alleged Walmart diaper thief was shot in the parking lot. “What we have at this point is that the individual felt threatened — one of the suspects reached for something [and he] thought that it was a weapon or firearm. The individual who was assisting the [employee] was armed and used that weapon to fire on the suspect.” After the shooting, the four suspects managed to get into their vehicle and attempted to flee the scene, reports the Orlando Sentinel. Orange County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Angelo Nieves told the media that the suspected diaper thieves didn’t make it far. Rather, they wrecked their getaway vehicle into two other parked cars in the Walmart parking lot and fled on foot. Shooter should be arrested. I suspect he was reaching for a receipt.

It had reportedly been carjacked last month. Three of the suspects in the Walmart theft incident reportedly got away and remain unidentified; the fourth suspect, who was shot in the incident, made it only as far as a gas station across the road. There, the alleged Walmart diaper thief reportedly sought help for his injuries, which witnesses claim that he knew were going to be fatal. “He was saying he was going to die and stuff and I sat down there and held his hand and said you’re going to be okay.” Emergency services were called from the Citgo gas station, and the alleged Walmart diaper thief was transported to a local hospital. He reportedly died at Orlando Regional Medical Center as a result of the wounds he sustained in the shooting.

Local law enforcement officers have confirmed that the dead teen was one of four shoplifters who stolen diapers from the Walmart location. According to witnesses to the alleged diaper theft gone wrong and subsequent shooting, the armed bystander fired five shots during the incident. Police confirm that the armed bystander admitted his role in the death of the Walmart diaper thief who was shot and confirm that the shooters is fully cooperating with investigators at this time; it is unclear whether the shooter may face criminal charges.

 5 things smart people never pay full price for Morgan Quinn, GOBankingRates Oct. 14, 2016, 3:50 PM 113,242 facebook linkedin twitter email print Joshua Lott/Getty Images Rich people don't accumulate wealth by spending their money carelessly. Some wealthy people are self-made and used to thrifty living, while others just prefer to spend less and save more. Either way, there are certain things successful people simply don't pay full price for. Here are some of the top things that rich people and celebrities avoid spending their money on. 1. Cars According to Brian Davis, real estate investor with Spark Rental, successful people never pay full price for cars. "The rich know that everything in life is negotiable," said Davis. "Every service, every commodity, even many physical products. And the trick to negotiation is finding other things the selling party wants, besides money." He went on to explain that car salespeople and dealerships are striving to meet quotas as well as price points. "A savvy buyer might show up on the last day of the month and say ‘I'm buying a car today. I might buy an Infiniti or I might buy an Acura, but I'm not willing to pay anywhere near full price. What is the absolute lowest price you can offer me on these three models?'" said Davis. Related: The Least – And Most – Expensive States to Own a Car It's not just successful people who don't have to pay full price for cars — the rest of us can cash in on this strategy, too. If you're in the market for a new car, Davis recommended collecting internet quotes on the models you are interested in, researching the wholesale prices and being willing to walk away if the salesperson won't give you the deal you desire. 2. Retail goods Wealthy people might enjoy perusing the aisles of popular luxury retailers, but the truth is that they rarely spend money there. Millionaire Corner, a wealth management news site, surveyed 1,200 investors to ask which retailers they actually shopped from. Among the respondents with a net worth of $5 million or more, Home Depot, Lowe's and Target were the most popular retail stores. Nearly half the respondents said they like to shop at Costco, while a third shop at Walmart. Bargain retail chains aren't just popular among successful people — celebrities love these stores, too. Gwen Stefani, Heidi Klum and Kylie Jenner are all Target fans. Jessica Alba, Zac Efron and Shia LaBeouf hit up the local Home Depot, and Britney Spears, Rihanna and Justin Bieber have been spotted at Walmart. Finally, even Jimmy Kimmel bought his wedding band at Costco. Stars — they‘re just like us! In addition to shopping at discount stores, the wealthy love clipping coupons. Despite having a net worth that Forbes pegs at $31 million, Carmelo Anthony uses coupons to cut his grocery bill. "I go to the supermarket, make sure I get the newspaper and tear the coupons out; save a dollar or two," Anthony told CBS Denver. Self-admitted cheapskate, and actress, Kristen Bell also loves to use coupons when shopping. "I almost exclusively shop with coupons," she told talk show host Conan O'Brien. The actress, who jokes about nicking her neighbor's 20 percent off Bed Bath & Beyond coupons, said, "If you go and buy a duvet or air conditioner or whatever, you could be saving upwards of $80." These days, you don't need to grab a flyer at the grocery store or snag your neighbor's mailers — you can easily score incredible coupons online. Discounts on everything from clothing and electronics to diapers and makeup are available at the click of your finger. Some of our favorite online coupon sites include Coupons.com, RetailMeNot.com, SlickDeals.net, DealNews.com and CouponSherpa.com. 3. Travel The richer you are, the less you pay for certain luxuries — including travel. According to a survey by Fidelity, 55 percent of credit card holders have rewards credit cards. While cash back was the most popular reward, free travel also ranked high on the list. Successful people use their spending power to score everything from free flights to first-class upgrades and access to premier boarding rooms. And when you have a lot of money, you can easily put more on a credit card — and pay it off — to rack up as many points as possible. However, there are ways you can score a luxury travel experience at a discount, even if you aren't wealthy. For example, there are many travel rewards credit cards out there for regular consumers and, with a little strategizing, you can score free airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars or first-class upgrades. There's even a service called JetSuite that offers next-day deals on private jet flights. Right now, the company is booking seats starting at just $129. 4. Real estate While the average person pays about a 6 percent commission fee to a real estate agent, successful people tend to pay much less — especially when selling their homes. "Successful people never pay a 6 percent commission," said Sissy Lappin, author of "Simple and Sold" and founder of ListingDoor. "They always negotiate when they are selling a home." This strategy is particularly beneficial if you’re selling a home that’s worth millions. For example, a $2 million home could net a real estate agent a $120,000 paycheck if he or she takes the standard 6 percent fee. Negotiating the rate down by half saves the owner $60,000, and the agent still walks away with a fat paycheck. Even if you aren’t in the market for a multimillion-dollar home, you can still negotiate your way to a better price. According to Zillow, shoppers in a buyers' market can score great deals by "asking for the moon." Start by making an initial offer that’s at least 10% under the price you're actually willing to pay and ask for any furniture and appliances you desire. You should also ask the seller to pay all the closing costs and set a closing date that works best for you. Best-case scenario, the seller accepts. Worst-case scenario (as long as you haven’t offended him or her), the seller counters. 5. Higher education Many private colleges slash prices for families that are rich enough to afford full tuition. Known as merit aid, this discount is used to lure academic all-stars to the school or make sure the institution enrolls enough wealthy students to meet financial targets. Among the dozens of elite private schools that provide financial aid unrelated to athletics or need, George Washington University offers funds to 20% of freshman; Tulane University to 37%; and Washington University in St. Louis to 14%, according to the Washington Post. And in the 2013-14 school year, Duke University provided scholarships worth an average of $56,000 a year to 67 freshman with no financial need. Merit aid might not be available to all students, but there are still ways to get a four-year degree for free. Forbes reports that there are about a dozen schools in the U.S. classified as "tuition-free" institutions. For example, Barclay College is a four-year Bible school that provides a full tuition scholarship to every student who enrolls at its Haviland, Kan., location. Prestigious conservatory Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia covers the tuition of each admitted student, and America's service academies — the Coast Guard, Air Force and Military and Naval academies — don't charge tuition, but they do usually require a service commitment of five years after graduation.

NEW YORK — More than 100 retailers, including Wal-Mart and Target as well as key trade associations, are launching a coalition aimed at fighting a Republican proposal on how imports get taxed, a measure they believe would harm their businesses. The National Retail Federation, along with the American International Automobile Dealers Association, the National Grocers Association and others are joining forces to form Americans for Affordable Products, which will run a campaign to educate consumers and show lawmakers that the so-called Border Adjusted Tax plan would push prices up to 20 percent higher for everyday items including clothing, food and gas. The diversified group, which includes Nike, Best Buy, luxury conglomerate LVMH and Dollar General, is trying to make their opposition heard even while Congress and the president try to sort out exactly what adjustments to put forth. Congressional Republicans want to eliminate tax incentives that encourage companies to move overseas, sharply cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, and encourage more factory output at home. But opponents say the plan would have a harmful rippling effect, causing companies to even lay off workers. The proposal — spearheaded by House GOP Speaker Paul Ryan and Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, the top Republican on the House tax-writing committee — would constitute the most sweeping reforms to corporate taxes in at least three decades. Trump has dismissed the cornerstone of the House GOP plan as “too complicated” and has been touting a 35 percent levy on imports. Yet his spokesman appeared to put the tax back in play last week by proposing a 20 percent tax on goods from Mexico and “other countries we have a trade deficit with” to pay for a border wall. “There's a rush to get this done in Congress. We want to make sure our voices are heard,” said David French, chief lobbyist for the National Retail Federation, which has been dispatching members to meet with lawmakers and members of the new administration. Details of the consumer campaign are being worked out, according to a spokeswoman at the retail trade group. A lot is at stake. Nearly all such items that U.S. shoppers buy are either wholly or partly produced overseas as companies have sought the cheapest way to make goods. And with online competition and shoppers trained to find the best deals, U.S. retailers haven't had the power to raise prices on many goods for several years. “I'm losing sleep. I am scared out of my mind,” said Rick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, which has signed on to the coalition. The family-owned company, based in Vernon Hills, Ill., makes educational toys and employs 150 people. He estimates that under the GOP plan, his federal tax rate would soar to 165 percent from 39.6 percent, he would have to raise prices by 10 to 15 percent to stay viable, and he would have to lay off employees. Retail industry leaders “describe it as an existential threat,” said Stephen Lamar, executive vice president at the American Apparel & Footwear Association, another member of the coalition. “When they crunch the numbers, it really affects things like solvency and profits.” Lamar said companies would likely have to pass along higher prices to shoppers, who wouldn't tolerate it. Companies say they also would have to try to squeeze suppliers for more savings and fear they might even have to lay off workers or close stores. George Feldenkreis, CEO of Perry Ellis International, estimates that he would have to raise prices on his clothing anywhere from 20 to 25 percent if the border tax went into effect. Shirts currently range in price from $14.99 to $49.99. “People who are thinking about it don't know the consequences,” Feldenkreis said. He added that the company would also have to lay off workers. “It's not just a retail implication,” said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the National Retail Federation. “We know it's going to impact Main Street in many ways. It could be autos, manufacturing.” The proposal would essentially tax corporations based on where their products and services are consumed, rather than on their incomes. In that way, it would be similar to a sales tax. House GOP supporters such as Ryan and Brady say that would eliminate the incentives for corporations to use complex schemes to shift their incomes to lower-tax jurisdictions. To ensure the tax is focused on U.S. sales only, it would exclude a company's export sales. But the cost of imported goods would be taxed. The tax could raise as much as $1.2 trillion in revenue over the next decade, which would help pay for the steep tax cuts included in the House GOP plan. Proponents say if the plan is enacted, the dollar will increase in value by as much as 25 percent, resulting in cheaper imports and offsetting the impact. But many economists and industry executives worry the dollar wouldn't adjust, or certainly not fast enough. And Lamar said a shirt label saying “Made in China” doesn't tell the whole story. Seventy percent of the value of the garment supports U.S. jobs in areas such as design and logistics, he said. Other groups also oppose the border-adjusted tax, including Americans for Prosperity, a conservative organization backed by billionaires Charles and David Koch, who typically donate generously to Republican campaigns. The tax would likely encourage companies to produce more in the United States, or buy more of their parts and components in America. Some companies say they could make those changes to avoid raising prices too much. Robert Sands, the CEO of Constellation Brands, said on a recent conference call that the company could purchase more natural gas from the United States, rather than Mexico, which it uses to make glass bottles for the Corona and Modelo beer it imports. “It's those kinds of things that we are looking at, planning on, if this comes to pass,” Sands said. “We don't expect consumer demand for our product to be affected.” Woldenberg, though, whose company makes 98 percent of its products overseas, said shifting his manufacturing to the country isn't an option. In the past three years, he said he tried twice to find some U.S. molders interested in making its products here, but it wasn't financially feasible.

CBS News CBS Evening News CBS This Morning 48 Hours 60 Minutes Sunday Morning Face The Nation CBSN GO Log In Log In Join CBSNews.com Crimesider/ MISSING MANHUNT COLD CASES PHOTOS 48 HOURS By Crimesider Staff CBS/AP February 7, 2017, 3:28 PM Prosecutors: Pair bought ammo while on the run in deadly crime spree William “Billy” Boyette, left, and Mary Rice Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email PENSACOLA, Fla. -- Authorities in Alabama issued capital murder warrants Tuesday as the search continued across two states for a man and woman wanted in the deaths of three women and the attempted killing of another. In Pensacola, Florida, Sheriff David Morgan doubled the number of deputies on patrol as the hunt for William “Billy” Boyette, 44, and Mary Rice, 37, entered its second week. Boyette and Rice are suspected in the deaths of Alicia Greer, 30, and Jacqueline Jeanette Moore, 39, whose bodies were found at the Emerald Sands Inn in nearby Milton, Florida, on Jan. 31. Investigators say the two suspects then drove across the state line and fatally shot Peggy Broz, 52, in Lillian, Alabama, on Friday, also taking Broz’s car. Florida state prosecutors told CBS affiliate WKRG the pair purchased ammunition during a trip to a Crestview, Florida, Walmart store Thursday, after the slayings in Milton but before Broz’s fatal shooting in Alabama. Investigators released a surveillance image of Rice inside the Walmart. Mary Rice captured on surveillance cameras at a Crestview, Fla. Walmart store, Feb. 2, 2017 WKRG The two also are accused of shooting and critically wounding Kayla Crocker, 28, on Monday, said Escambia County Sheriff’s Chief Deputy Chip Simmons. He warned residents in the Florida Panhandle county to be on the lookout for Boyette and Rice. “In short we have a killer, he is in our midst. Everyone, and I mean everyone, should be aware of this, should be aware of what they look like,” Simmons said Monday afternoon. Agencies across the Panhandle and southern Alabama earlier had been told to consider Rice a person of interest in the attacks. On Monday she was upgraded to an official suspect. Authorities said she had multiple chances to flee or ask for help. She also has been spotted on surveillance video entering stores on her own. In Alabama, sheriff’s investigators named the two in the capital murder warrants and said in a news release that Rice was with Boyette when Broz was shot and killed during the early morning hours of Feb. 3. They also warned that the two should be considered dangerous and advised anyone who might see them to call 911. Just in: Please take a close look at both of these photos. We just received these recent pictures of William Boyette and...Posted by Escambia County Sheriff's Office on Monday, February 6, 2017 In Florida, Crocker’s mother went to check on her after she didn’t show up for work Monday morning. She found Crocker with a gunshot wound. Her 2-year-old son was not injured, sheriff’s officials said. Crocker’s white Chevrolet Cobalt was stolen and the sheriff told news outlets that video surveillance confirmed Boyette and Rice took the car to a nearby Shell station and ate at a Hardee’s restaurant a short time after the attack. Morgan said Boyette has a history of drug trafficking and is known to be a heavy user of the drug Spice. He said his agency has been “chasing a lot of shadows and a lot of rumors” in the search and warned residents to stay alert. “When you go to work, when you come home, make sure a friend or family member knows where you are,” Morgan said. He added that while the measures may seem extreme, “we’re dealing with an extreme situation here.” © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Scott, Jr. (FDScottJr@gmail.com) 4 days ago 243 views  Tags: Black History Month Frank Scott Jr. 0 SHARES Share Tweet As we celebrate Black History Month, I’m reminded of the role black business leaders played in the Civil Rights Movement. Many may not know about the black lawyers, doctors, entrepreneurs, and more who helped push the Movement forward. These leaders showed that business is not just about the bottom line. It can also help advance entire communities. With that in mind, I wanted to share a bit about a few of Arkansas’ business leaders who have exhibited the impact business can have on communities. Some of these individuals you may know, while others you may not. John H. Johnson founded Johnson Publishing in 1942, after discovering that the black community had a desire for news about the community that went beyond crime. The Arkansas City native took this knowledge to publish his first magazine, Negro Digest. He went on to publish Ebony Magazine, the largest black-owned media publication in the country, and then launched Jet Magazine. During the Civil Rights Movement, Ebony became a critical source of information as Ebony writers covered church meetings and the magazine published contributions from Martin Luther King, Walter White, and Langston Hughes, among several other influential voices in the Civil Rights Movement. Jet Magazine published the photo of Emmett Till that helped make his murder national news. The photo garnered so much attention that Jet had to reprint its publication for the first time. For his contributions, Mr. Johnson earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996. Rosalind Brewer is the former CEO of Sam’s Club where she led the company for five years before stepping down in January. Prior to leading Sam’s Club, Brewer joined Wal-Mart as a vice president and rose through the ranks to become executive vice president of Wal-Mart’s East business unit. Brewer has helped push for diversity in corporate America and has served as a role model for women of color who aspire to lead some of the largest companies in the world. Brewer continues to take leadership roles. She has been nominated to join the board of directors at Starbucks with shareholders slated to vote on her nomination. If elected to the board, she would join another black woman on Starbuck’s board, Mellody Hobson, president of Ariel Investments, the first African-American owned money management firm with publicly traded mutual funds in the United States. Charles Phillips is CEO of Infor, the third largest enterprise application company in the world, and has built a reputation as an innovative leader and a top dealmaker in the technology industry. The Little Rock native and Arkansas Black Hall of Fame member graduated from the Air Force Academy, holds a law degree from New York University School of Law, and has a master’s degree in business administration from Hampton University. After serving as a Captain in the U.S. Marine Corps, Phillips began building his reputation on Wall Street, rising to become one of the top managing directors at Morgan Stanley. Larry Ellison, former Oracle CEO, recruited Phillips to join the company as president where he oversaw the Oracle’s tripling in size through 70 acquisitions over seven years. He became CEO of Infor in 2010, and has built the privately-held company into one of Oracle’s biggest competitors with well over $2 billion dollars of revenue just in 2016. As a leader in the community, Phillips has provided financial aid to single parents, disadvantaged students interested in engineering, and wounded veterans through the Karen and Charles Phillips Foundation. Gerald Alley founded Con-Real in 1979, one of the leading construction and real estate firms in the Southwest and Southeast, with clients including Hilton, Homewood Suites, Home Depot, Wal-Mart, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Kroger. The Pine Bluff native and Arkansas Black Hall of Fame member studied finance at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville and earned a master’s degree in business administration from Southern Methodist University. He has been impactful in the Pine Bluff community and serves on many boards in Texas. Beyond Con-Real, Alley began a number of other companies, including The Alley Group, a project management services firm in San Francisco, and Bravado, a real estate and hospitality firm in Arlington, Texas. Further, the Gerald and Candace Alley Foundation supports disadvantaged youth through the creation of educational opportunities. These black leaders epitomize how success in business can serve as a platform to positively impact our communities. Business has a real impact on communities and Black History Month is a great opportunity for us to highlight that.

According to an 18-year-old who pulled his truck into the gas station, two men jumped into his truck bed at around 6:00 Monday night. The two men then demanded the teen drive them to Walmart on Old Fort Parkway as one of the two men pulled out a gun, according to a police report. After the victim drove to Walmart, the men jumped out of the truck bed and allegedly tried to open his door. However, the teenager locked the door before they could gain access. Minutes after the event was reported, police located a subject walking out of the KFC on Old Fort Parkway at Chaffin Place who appeared to be intoxicated. The subject matched the description of one of the two men who jumped into the truck bed. When officers asked the man where he had recently visited, Jason Griffy told police he had been to Thornton's and "hitched a ride" with someone. He also told police that he had visited Walmart. While at KFC, the manager of the restaurant told police that Griffy was in the way of people trying to get their food. The manager also suggested that the suspect was argumentative. Griffy, who is 33 years old, was placed under arrest and charged with public intoxication. The 18 year old victim told police that he thought he was going to get shot and the subjects were planning to steal his truck. Murfreesboro Detectives were notified about the possible attempted aggravated robbery case, but charges for the reported attempt have not yet been filed. Authorities are still trying to verify who the second subject was who jumped into the bed of the truck.

Part of the annual festivities of the LPGA Tour’s Walmart NW Arkansas Championship at Pinnacle Country Club, the BITE food festival is scheduled for June 22 and 23, with tastings from area restaurants and brands represented the first night and Beer & Burger Fest the second. 8th Street Market stretches about 10 acres along 8th Street in the city’s downtown Market District. Also home to Brightwater:  A Center for the Study of Food, a program of NorthWest Arkansas Community College, the market is intended ultimately to “showcase culinary education, music and the arts, new restaurant and hospitality venues and other specialized food and drink concepts,” according to the BITE press release. “8th Street Market will bring a truly unique culinary experience to Northwest Arkansas. We could not be more excited to be their inaugural signature event and to partner with them in building upon the momentum of BITE NW Arkansas,” Harry Hardy, event director, said in the release. “The unique qualities that 8th Street Market will bring as an event venue will enable us to grow attendance and enhance experiences for our restaurant and brewery partners, sponsors and guests.” The two previous BITE events took place at the Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion in Rogers. Brightwater Executive Director Glenn Mack said in the release, “Given all the culinary and hospitality growth throughout Northwest Arkansas and in Bentonville specifically, I think BITE NW Arkansas is a great way to help introduce 8th Street Market and Brightwater to the residents of the region.” Bentonville-based Bike Rack Brewery has also announced that it will open a second location in an 8,000 square-foot facility at 8th Street Market. “We are ecstatic that BITE NW Arkansas is moving to 8th Street Market and that our brewery will have the chance to help grow the impact of the event,” Jeff Charlson, CEO and partner at Bike Rack, said in the release. Tickets for BITE NW Arkansas, starting at $30, go on sale March 1, along with tickets to the Walmart NW Arkansas Championship. The 2017 Walmart NW Arkansas Championship is sponsored by Procter & Gamble.

I walked through the old Wal-Mart in Olathe with my father and older brother Nick. We were looking for a Luke Skywalker action figure to go with our new Rancor playset. We walked past the tires in the automotive section and a thought suddenly struck me– I don't know who my father's favorite baseball player. It seemed like the sort of thing every kid should know– even Smalls from The Sandlot knew his stepdads favorite player. So I asked, "Dad who's your favorite baseball player?" He obviously gave me the most predictable answer a Kansas City kid could ever get, "George Brett," he said, and then quickly went back to talking to my brother about more important things, like Darth Vader being Luke's father or whatever (#SpoilerAlert) Of course his favorite player was George Brett. Old number 5 is almost everyones favorite player. He's our cities crude and sometimes drunken messiah who we love despite his social missteps–sometimes because of his social missteps. I didn't really want to ask my brother who his favorite player was– I mean I already knew the answer. It was Danny Tartabull. Nick had 29 of his of his baseball cards and never shut up about him. But it felt rude not to ask him since I already asked my dad, so I asked anyway, albiet a little rhetorically, "Hey Nick who's your favorite player? Danny Tartabull? Cool." "Yeah, Danny Tartabull," he said. Now came the moment I had secretly been waiting for all along. In my own kidlike way, I had been trying to social engineer the situation in order to make them ask me the same question. Maybe it was because they were talking about Star Wars and I didn't really understand what they were talking about, or maybe it was because baseball was all I cared about back then (well baseball and Teddy Ruxpin.) I wanted them to know who my favorite player was, but I didn't just want to come out and say it. I needed them to ask me. I wanted them to want to know who my favorite player was. I waited. And waited. My brother asked my dad something about Emporer Palpatine that still doesn't make any sense to me. My dad said something back that I didn't understand. I waited some more. Still nothing. Finally I got tired of waiting and said, "Do you want to know who my favorite player is?" I'm sure I sounded like a drunk significant other who was desperate for attention when I said it, but I didn't care anymore. To hell with social engineering. I wanted them to want to know. I think my dad realized he'd been neglecting me, beecause he suddenly stopped talking to my brother and looked down at me like he actually cared about what I just said and asked, "Okay, who is your favorite player?" This is the moment I'd been waiting for my entire life– well at least the whole day for. I was beaming ear to ear. Two words came out of my mouth. "Buddy Biancalana." It took every ounce of fatherly love my dad had in his 6'2 frame not to burst into laughter whe he heard my answer. My brother on the other hand was not so kind. "Buddy Biancalana," exclaimed Nick, "he stinks." I honestly didn't know anything about Buddy Biancalana, or the fact that he lived below the Mendoza line at the time when I said this. "No he doesn't, he's my favorite, I don't care what you say." My dad smiled. Maybe it was because of the innocence of the situation. Maybe it was because he realized for the first time what a grade A doofus his second born son was. But my dad's a kind man and he wasn't about to crush me there in the store in front of my brother and the fake christmas trees and everyone else. "Why is he your favorite baseball player?" He asked. Now when I look back on this moment and think about it hard enough, it all came down to one reason. He was my favorite player because I liked his name and it was fun to say. Buddy Biancalana. I mean seriously– say his name and try not to smile. Heck, I'm pretty sure if you go in the bathroom, turn the lights off, look in the mirror, and say his name three times fast, he'll burst through the glass riding shirtless and bareback on an effing unicorn like Vladamir Putin, farting stardust and pooping glitter covered baseballs. His name was Buddy. A buddy is your friend. It felt like he was my pal. Like we were on the same team. It wasn't until later that I realized that buddy was only a nickname and that his real name is Roland Americo Biancalana. I mean Roland is a fine name and all, but I'm not sure that if as a child, if I would have seen a card that said Roland Biancalana on it, that it would have invoked in me the same sense of wonder that a guy named Buddy did. I'm an adult now, and we live in an age of statistics, but the name Buddy hasn't lost any of its shine for me. Speaking of stats, his were ugly. I mean really ugly. In 550 at-bats he had a career .205 avg. A .261 OBP. And a 28.5% strikeout rate. Now if I wanted to be a real homer, I'd point out that by Dayton Moore's standard, Buddy never got a fair shake. It takes 1500 at-bats to know what a player will be in the big leagues, and Biancalana only got 1/3 of this. If he was given more time would he have suddenly morphed into a 10 ft. tall mix of Bo Jackson and a Wampa? I guess we'll never know. I've had a lot of players that I really liked over the years– George Brett, Bo Jackson, Ricky Henderson, Albert Belle, Frank Thomas, Gordo, Bob The Hammer Hamelin, Salvy, Pudge Rodriguez, Benny The Jet, Miguel Olivo– the list could go on forever, but nobody has ever made me feel the same way as I did when I was a little kid sitting in my room, looking at his 1987 Topps Baseball card. When I was 13, the players went on strike and Nick stopped watching baseball. When I was 14 my parents got divorced. When I was 18 my house burned down and I lost every baseball card I ever owned, including my Buddy Biancalana. That card was worth more to me than a T206 Wagner card (okay maybe not that much.) I haven't ever replaced it, and I don't know if I ever will. The sense of wonder I felt as a kid doesn't reside in that card, it laid in the innocence of childhood. It was the fact that I had dad who loved me enough to take me to the store to find a Luke Skywalker toy. It was that my older brother took the time to teach me what ERA, SO, BB, AVG, SB, H, and HR, meant on the back of a baseball card. We live in a cynacle world where people assume negative intent on almost everything that comes out of your mouth, so I think it's important that we remember who our childhood heros were and accept the fact that they will never be the people we built them up to be in our minds– and that's okay, because no matter what, they taught us how to love something beyond ourselves. Life is hard, and you never know who is struggling just to stay above the Mendoza line. Be good to each other, beause everyone needs at least one fan. So here's to you Buddy Biancalana, you're my ride or die favorite player no matter what. Note: I didn't realize until I sat down to write this, that Buddy Biancalana had already been traded to the Houston Astros by the time he became my favorite player. #DoesntChangeAThing This FanPost was written by a member of the Royals Review community.

The regular-sized New Nintendo 3DS hit US shores a few months later in September of the same year. And yet, while you can go into any Best Buy or Walmart on the planet and pick up an Xbox One S or PlayStation 4 Pro — despite being much newer consoles — you’re unlikely to spot a single Nintendo 3DS handheld. Nintendo has said publicly that its latest smartphone games are meant to attract gamers to the rich, more expensive experiences on their own hardware. But how’s that plan supposed to work if the gadgets are perpetually out of stock? I’m experiencing this headache firsthand. You see, I'm a lapsed Fire Emblem fan. But this weekend, after playing through the recently released Fire Emblem Heroes on my phone, I was hungry for a more serious Fire Emblem hit. I'd heard great things about the recent Awakening and Fates entries on the 3DS. I figured I’d buy a New 3DS and see how the series has progressed since the good old Game Boy Advance days. From Nintendo's perspective, I was more or less a perfect marketing response to their free-to-play title. It's not physically possible to buy a New 3DS today One problem: it's not physically possible to buy a New 3DS. This isn't hyperbole or exaggeration. It's just simply not possible to get a New 3DS, either in the more common XL size or the mythical regular version without turning to the grey market. Online, Amazon and Walmart defer to expensive third-party sellers. Toys R Us’ links forward you to a 2DS instead. Best Buy lists several models of the New 3DS XL, but has them listed as "Store Pickup." Checking availability on any model will inform you that the handhelds are sold out within a 250-mile radius of New York City. Target has New 3DS XL models listed, but it's out of stock online and in stores, too. B&H notes that it's temporarily sold out of New 3DS XLs and expects to have more back in stock in March or April, depending on the color you prefer. GameStop doesn't have any new New 3DS XL models in stock, but will happily sell you a preowned one, while Nintendo's own online store only offers refurbished units. And while a new, limited edition Pikachu model is planned to go on sale February 24th, preorders for those seem to have already sold out. Is it possible to buy a regular sized New 3DS at retail right now? Pretty sure the answer is no. Also, WHY Nintendo??? Do you hate money?— Chaim Gartenberg (@cgartenberg) February 3, 2017 As for the smaller New 3DS model? Well, those haven't been available at retail since last fall's Black Friday sale, and Nintendo doesn't even reference that it even exists on the official 3DS site. In fact, Nintendo has bafflingly never sold the smaller console outside of special edition bundles in the US. Third-party sellers have plenty of grey market units to offer, if you're willing to pay Of course, eBay and third-party sellers on Amazon have plenty of grey market units to offer, if you're willing to pay. Interested buyers will pony up a $50–$70 premium (at least) for a New 3DS XL (which retails for $199.99). Special edition variants run for far more. The standard New 3DS is even worse, in some cases selling for more than its larger cousin. But short of stumbling into a forgotten piece of inventory in a physical store, these are your only options to buy a Nintendo console right now. Neither is this a temporary or recent problem — our friends over at Polygon noted a similar absence of 3DS availability back in December. That piece ran days after Nintendo released its first smartphone game, Super Mario Run. Months later, with Fire Emblem Heroes available on smartphones, Nintendo’s play to convert mobile game lovers into handheld owners is mired by the most Nintendo problem of all: limited stock. It'd be easy to blame the New 3DS supply on the Switch taking its place — after all, it can be used as a fully portable console in its own right — but Nintendo has been steadfastly sticking to the line that it intends on supporting and developing the 3DS hardware in tandem with its new home console as recently as last week. Like I said, this isn't Nintendo's first supply chain problem. Months after launch, the NES Classic is still laughably rare hard to find, despite the massive demand. Nintendo Switch preorders are sold out across the board, at least in the US, as are several of the Switch controller models and accessories. On the other hand, Nintendo has pledged to have over two million Switch consoles available at launch, which is considered to be a fairly ambitious sales number for it to reach. If the Switch does turn out to be hard to find, it will probably be because of a strong launch for Nintendo. Reggie Fils-Aime, the president of Nintendo of America, has also noted in an interview with Wired that the company is aware of the unexpected demand of other products like the NES Classic, and has said that “[Nintendo’s] focus is making sure that the consumer who wants to buy a Nintendo Switch can buy a Nintendo Switch.” But to put it plainly, with the Nintendo Switch launch right around the corner, the current inability to purchase the 3DS should seriously worry anyone without a preorder in place. Because if the Switch turns out to be as successful as the NES Classic or 3DS have been, fans could be facing yet another tough choice between a long wait or a grey market gouging for a Nintendo console.

But for many other retailers, the challenge of balancing and streamlining their physical and digital commerce operations continues to be a challenge. Data from Retail Systems Research (RSR) looked at a number of external factors that will put more pressure on retailers and suppliers over the next five years. At first glance, it might appear that worries about omnichannel retailing is lessening; the number of respondents concerned about the category decreased from 39% to 30% between 2015 and 2016. But this is misleading, RSR emphasized in its report. In fact, consumer buying preferences increased as a factor that could affect retailers and suppliers’ business, jumping from 61% to 74% during the same period. These consumer expectations will have an important impact on retailers’ omnichannel efforts. Shifting buying preferences are making it harder for retailers to develop a consistent, unified experience across their physical and digital operations. The same RSR study found that consumers’ buying decisions were based around factors like pricing (cited by 68%), product availability (54%), product assortment (36%) and free shipping (27%). Yet retailers hoping to meet consumer expectations related to these priorities often face a complicated logistical path. A survey by Boston Retail Partners, which examined the implementation of various omnichannel commerce capabilities, indicated that no more than 25% of retail executives felt that their omnichannel capabilities in areas like product assortment, consistent pricing or inventory visibility were “implemented and working well.” Indeed, much of the work related to these areas remains incomplete, they’re either in the early phases of rollout or plan to be incorporated in the next few years. Even as the omnichannel revolution moves ahead for big retail firms, other retail players are finding that the challenge of meeting omnichannel expectations is easier said than done. —Jeremy Kressmann Test Your Customer Acquisition and Data-Driven Marketing Know-How A large-scale priority for most marketers is acquiring new customers.

Big US Companies May Be Hurt By Tariffs Amid Global Recession Fears By Bobby Ilich On 02/07/17 AT 8:10 AM Close Economists have warned of the effects President Donald Trump's potential trade war with Mexico will have on both the U.S. and Mexican economies. While there has been some walking back, Trump had proposed a 20 percent tariff on Mexican goods to help pay for a wall along the southern border. Mexico would almost certainly suffer a recession with rising unemployment and a weakening peso, and the U.S. economy would be weakened in what could lead to a global recession. Two prominent Republican senators, John McCain and Lindsey Graham, have publicly expressed concern about Trump's tariff policy and changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). “Any effort to restrict or impose new barriers on our ability to trade with Mexico and Canada could jeopardize the future of this trade agreement and have serious consequences for Arizona and the country,” McCain said in January. Only Canada and China are larger trading partners than Mexico with roughly $531 billion in goods traded between the two countries in 2015. If a trade war occurs, Americans would have to pay more for avocados, tomatoes, beer, and tequila -- and that's just food. Well-known companies may also feel the pinch. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., one of the largest Mexican food chain in the U.S., relies on the price of avocados and tomatoes, which they mostly get from Mexico. Chipotle reported fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday with sales at Chipotle's established restaurants falling 4.8 percent. The company disclosed that they were hurt by the rising cost of avocados and chopped tomatoes. In a recent Barron's article, Maxim analyst Stephen Anderson cited that "a case of avocados now costs $40, while a 25-pound box of tomatoes goes for $11." So a 20 percent tariff would severely hit Chipotle's earnings per share. Then there's Wal-Mart. The super chain has over 2,400 stores in Mexico and relies heavily on Mexican imports. Much of Wal-Mart's sales come from produce so a tariff would almost certainly mean a spike in prices and therefore hurt their long-term outlook. Related Stories Trump Wants To ‘Speed Up’ Process To Gut NAFTA Mexico May Pull Out Of NAFTA "Wal-Mart has been losing a lot of business already for other reasons. They cannot survive as a high-priced retailer. I'm not saying they would go bankrupt the next day, but in the long run a lot of what Wal-Mart does just wouldn't make sense," said economist Tyler Cowen in a Bloomberg report in August. A day after Trump proposed the 20 percent tariff, shares of Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) dropped more than 1 percent. Since Nov. 9, shares of Wal-Mart Stores have dropped from $71.10 to a close of $66.40 on Monday. Aside from Chipotle and Wal-Mart, a trade war with Mexico could have damaging effects on the overall economy. “For both the U.S. and Mexico, it’s challenging because if you start putting tariffs on imports from the other country, you’re essentially putting tariffs on some of the inputs of many of the things you want to make,” Robert Blecker, professor of economics at the American University, told Salon in January.

Arthur “Art” Adams, 19, was a gang member who was planning to sell the diapers, Orange County sheriff’s Capt. Angelo Nieves said. A customer — a 50-year-old man — shot Adams after stepping in to help an employee who had followed Adams and two people with him to the parking lot, investigators said. Nieves would not release the customer’s name, saying the information is “active criminal investigative information” and therefore exempt from disclosure under Florida’s public records law. Arthur Adams Orange County Jail Arthur Adams Arthur Adams (Orange County Jail) He also wouldn’t say whether the customer had a permit to legally carry a concealed weapon or if the suspected thief was armed at the time of the shooting. Detectives are investigating and plan to forward their findings to the Orange-Osceola State Attorney’s Office for a decision on whether the customer should be charged. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings urged the public not to rush to judgment. “The use of deadly force will be evaluated based on law and the right to protect one's self or others from great bodily harm or death,” he said in a statement.  Adams had been arrested at least nine times since 2011 on charges including grand theft, fleeing law enforcement and selling marijuana. A Facebook page that appears to be his shows him grinning as he displays guns and wads of cash. In June, Adams was sentenced to 239 days in jail and four years of probation after pleading no contest to two racketeering charges. He failed to report to his probation officer in August and September and was declared an absconder after he couldn’t be found, Department of Corrections records show. On Monday, Nieves said detectives were trying to identify a man seen on surveillance video with Adams at Wal-Mart. The Sheriff’s Office wouldn’t release the name of the third person, a girl. Deputies said she took off after the shooting but showed up at a hospital with a gunshot wound to her leg. The incident unfolded about 8:15 a.m. when Adams and the others walked out of the store on Clarcona Ocoee Road at Pine Hills Road with two carts full of unpaid merchandise, according to the Sheriff’s Office. At some point, the customer who stepped in to help the employee thought one of the suspects was arming himself and felt threatened, deputies said. The man then grabbed his gun and opened fire. Deputies said Adams and the two others got into a red Nissan Rogue that was stolen during a carjacking Jan. 14 in Orange County and tried to drive away. They crashed into two other vehicles in the parking lot before getting out and running, according to the Sheriff’s Office. Adams was found across the street at a Citgo gas station. He died at a hospital.  Staff writers Susan Jacobson and David Harris contributed to this report. sallen@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5417 Caption Officer disciplined after mistaking doughnut glaze for meth Cpl.

Instead of having suppliers at the retailer’s year beginning meetings held as in the past, Wal-Mart is holding a two-day Supplier Growth Forum Feb. 15-16 at the John Q Hammons Convention Center in Rogers. Suppliers have plenty of questions given the recent announcement in the retailer’s replenishment division and ongoing changes being made at Walmart.com under the leadership of new CEO Mark Lore. Suppliers are likely to hear from McMillon, Walmart U.S. CEO Greg Foran and Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna either in the opening or closing segments. The opening session is slated for two hours, then suppliers will hear from executives regarding private brands and the categories of hardlines (non-personal items like sporting equipment and electronics) entertainment and seasonal. The next session will deal with operational excellence for direct store delivery (DSD) suppliers. These suppliers bypass the distribution center. Items that are commonly DSD include bread, soft drinks like Coca Cola as well as chips and other snacks from suppliers like Kraft and Frito-Lay. The last session on Wednesday Feb. 15 will review in-store events. This has been a push by McMillon in the past few years trying to get suppliers to sponsor events and bring more excitement through retailtainment into the stores. Last year Walmart U.S. Chief Marketing Officer Tony Rogers announced “Walmart’s New Every Friday” program where customers can sample new products which are highlighted around the stores. Rogers said the company put together a retailtainment committee comprised of merchants and merchandisers to ensure stores around the country are seen as destinations for friends and families. Rogers made the announcement in June 2016 and to date the response from suppliers has been a somewhat lackluster (at least locally) based on a number of stores in Northwest Arkansas routinely visited on Fridays. Insiders expected Wal-Mart to make another push for suppliers to take part as Rogers said the retailer has learned there be a 300% lift in sales when a new product is demonstrated in stores for customers. Day two of the conference will include a session on digital acceleration, not a surprise given Wal-Mart’s efforts expand its e-commerce capabilities in its U.S. business. The retailer also is in the midst of restructuring the e-commerce division amid a recent layoff off 200 workers and a new management team assembled by Lore. Eric Howerton, CEO of WhyteSpyder, expects the retailer will again urge suppliers to get onboard with the mandate for unique product content for all items sold on Walmart.com. He said there has been hesitancy among some consumer packaged good vendors to provide Walmart.com product content that is not also provided to competitors like Amazon. “Walmart.com wants the content to be uniquely theirs, highly searchable with photos and videos where applicable,” Howerton said. “Too many suppliers are merely compliant with the bare minimum content and missing opportunities to grow in-store sales which is high on McMillon’s radar.” Suppliers will also hear about direct import possibilities. This topic is timely given the talk of an adjusted border tax for imports by the President Donald Trump’s administration. Wal-Mart is among a retail consortium to protest this tax. McMillon was also among the CEO’s asked to meet with Trump on Friday (Feb. 3) in the nation’s capitol. Wal-Mart will hold a two-hour closing session with suppliers to wrap up the two-day summit. More information on hardlines will be discussed in this session as well as expectations for suppliers as the retailer begins a new fiscal year.

(AP) — Investigators say a customer who fatally shot a man suspected of stealing diapers from a Wal-Mart store in Florida also injured a second person. Orange County Sheriff's Capt. Angelo Nieves tells local news outlets that three men left the store in Orlando with stolen items Saturday and were loading the merchandise into a vehicle when a store employee approached them. An armed customer heard the commotion and came to the employee's aid. Nieves says the customer thought 19-year-old Arthur Adams was going for a gun and fired his weapon. Initially deputies thought the customer only shot Adams but later learned a juvenile girl sitting in the vehicle was hit in the leg. She fled the scene and went to a hospital hours later. A third suspect is still being sought. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

The first arrest stemmed from a report of a man who allegedly stole merchandise and fled from the store. As Herkimer police were en route to the scene, they were contacted by State DEC officers who told them a man was running westbound on Route 5. A vehicle was stopped which was occupied by 38-year-old George Eissler of Mohawk and operated by a female. During the course of the investigation, it was learned that Eissler was in possession of items alleged to have been stolen. He was arrested and charged with Petit Larceny and will appear in village court at a later date. The second arrest came as a result of a report of a male pushing a cart of stolen merchandise through the locked doors, removing them from the track. Officers arrived and located a male matching the description, running while pushing the cart of merchandise toward a vehicle. He was directed by police to stop, but he continued to attempt to flee. He was apprehended by police, and the manager of the store was able to identify him as the man who allegedly stole the merchandise. 26-year-old Michael Curcio was arrested, transported to the Police Station and charged with Petit Larceny and Obstruction. He was processed and held for arraignment. He has been remanded to Herkimer County Correctional Facility.

But costs for employers increased just 2.5 percent across all prescription drugs, Express Scripts said in its new Drug Trend Report, released Monday. The St. Louis-based PBM, which negotiates drug prices on behalf of insurers and employers, hailed the difference in figures as evidence that it saves the system money. "In a year where the issue of high drug prices was No. 1 on the list of payer and policymaker concerns, the data show that our solutions protected our clients and patients," Dr. Glen Stettin, chief innovation officer at Express Scripts, said in a statement. But drug companies, growing increasingly public in their battle with PBMs, may use the same figures to fuel their arguments that the middlemen help push list prices up. Drug manufacturers say it's the rebates, or discounts, wrangled by PBMs that drive list prices higher; PBMs take a percentage of the rebates, the rest of which they pass on to clients. So the bigger the rebate, the more PBMs take home. It's a debate that gained steam last summer, when Mylan CEO Heather Bresch pointed her finger at PBMs and other members of the health-care system as a reason for the skyrocketing price of her company's EpiPen epinephrine auto-injector. Since then, other drug companies have joined the chorus, and industry group PhRMA released a study last month saying brand drug companies keep only 47 percent of total U.S. prescription drug spending. Drug industry analysts seized on the figures Monday. "Two. Point. Five. Percent," Evercore ISI's Mark Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients. "I understand that the pharma/biotech industry is an easy political target. But the facts aren't really so offensive." It's a narrative Express Scripts, and other PBMs, reject. "Rebates do not raise drug prices, drugmakers do," Express Scripts' Stettin said in the statement Monday. Mike Mergen | Bloomberg | Getty Images A pharmacy technician fills a prescription inside a Wal-Mart store in Trevose, Pennsylvania. Indeed, Ross Muken, who covers pharmacy benefits managers for Evercore ISI, took the opposite side from his colleague in a note Monday. "We view this year's iteration of the drug trend report to be a base of defense against the recent uptick in Pharma lobby noise," Muken wrote. Still, he conceded, "The reality is that while many of the main causes of inflation are certainly the responsibility of the pharma industry, the supply chain has none the less benefited in many instances." The average list price for a brand drug last year was $307.86, more than triple what it was in 2008, Express Scripts said in its report. It compared that with price inflation for common household items during that same period, of 14 percent. The debate over drug prices is nothing new, but it snowballed leading into the 2016 U.S. presidential election. President Donald Trump, in his first news conference, said the pharmaceutical industry was "getting away with murder" in its pricing practices. In a meeting last week with several pharma CEOs, Trump praised the industry for its contributions to human health, while still saying prices need to come down. Some drug companies have made commitments to limit price increases, Allergan most publicly with a "social contract" promising to limit increases to less than 10 percent annually. Drugmakers made a similar pledge in 1993 under scrutiny from President Bill Clinton, vowing to keep increases on average in line with inflation. The consumer price index rose 2.1 percent for the 12 months ended in December, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Sixto Mercado, vice president of top trade lobby Canaive’s branch in Jalisco State, home to Guadajara said that it would be a good idea if the government did something to compensate against this [the Trump tariff]. As they have many apparel exporters here who would be affected. However, Mexico is set to begin negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement by May to meet Trump’s calls for a rewrite. The economy minister Ildefonso Guajardo said that in mid-January if Trump imposes a tariff or a border adjustment tax, Mexico would pursue “mirror actions.” The statement is an indication of the growing tensions between the two neighboring countries, longtime allies, as Trump pursues his plan to build a wall along the border and claims that Mexico will pay for it. The 20 percent tariff or other duty proposal forms part of the plan to fund the wall. The U.S. ships roughly $6.5 billion worth of apparel and textiles to Mexico — $4 billion is fabric and $1.2 billion apparel parts, according to Canaive. Conversely, Mexico sends back $4.5 billion worth of clothing and textiles — $3.5 billion of apparel and $1 billion of textiles. A possible trade war has strained diplomatic relations and unleashed a nationalist uproar in Mexico with populist groups calling for consumers to boycott American companies including Wal-Mart, Starbucks and McDonalds. Social media is abuzz with tweets-for-tats urging citizens buy Mexican goods with hashtags such as #AdiosWalmart, allegedly hitting sales at the U.S. discounter’s largest international division. A Wal-Mart spokesman said that the firm is “monitoring the situation” but had no further comment. If the proposed 20 percent tariff is levied (among other options) to pay for Trump’s border wall and Mexico hits back, they could grow below zero, Mercado said, adding that exports could plunge 10 percent, despite a record-low peso. In 2016, the textiles and apparel sector grew 5 percent as strong local apparel sales offset a 4.3 percent drop in U.S. sales. As Mexico flirts with a possible recession, Mixto said that local sales could this year grow 7 percent compared to 10 percent in 2016. Amid strong anti-American sentiment, local-brand turnover could eclipse U.S. brands for the first time in recent memory. Everyone is being urged to buy Mexican products. This will hit American brand sales. Many consumers could shun Wal-Mart in lieu of Mexican archrival Coppel or choose to buy at department-store chain Liverpool’s lower-end unit Fabricas de Francia. Mexican fashion designers, long in the shadows, could win consumer hearts. This is bad news for the likes of the Axo or El Palacio de Hierro network, which have grown by bringing aspirational U.S. brands such as ck Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Abercrombie & Fitch south of the border. An executive at Axo said that the 20-brand franchisor has not seen “any sales declines” from the patriotic upsurge and is operating “business-as-usual.” It’s clear Axo and rival Sordo Madaleno, a top architecture firm making a leap into foreign fashion licensing (it just opened Mexico’s first AllSaints outlet) will suffer as consumers tighten their belts and seek “Made in Mexico.” In Europe, Mexican fashion jean labels Oggi and Siete Leguas could make successful forays because they have high-quality products using innovative fabrics and new washing technologies, according to Mercado. These companies sell premium jeans to Levi’s, Wrangler and True Religion so they could also start selling in Europe. That will require even more innovation, training and other investment the industry has been slow to pursue. They need to make more fashion and design and to diversify their exports because they are too dependent on the U.S., said Alfonso Zepeda, the man behind Expo Denim, a denim trade fair set to open in Guadjalajara in late May, adding that European expansion should be a priority. Here in Jalisco they make great coats, cotton knits, denim pants and suits. They could sell these to smaller, H&M-like stores. Europe represents a huge opportunity with their low peso and there are niches they could exploit Mexican apparel producers to meet the challenges are seeking new markets in Central America and Europe with which Mexico has a largely vague free-trade agreement. Costa Rica, Panama and Central America could be good markets to compete on price and quality. 0 YarnsandFibers News Bureau Cotton prices move higher on short supply of quality cotton Turkish duty on US cotton to hit competiveness of its own textile exports View All...

Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun.

During his campaign, Trump said the United States pays too much of the cost for the alliance, and he would make some NATO members contribute more money, defending those who have "fulfilled their obligations to us."

An amateur boxer was on hand to demonstrate hand-to-hand combat techniques, and the clinic was billed as open to "everyone except Republicans." Event planners specifically encouraged women to attend the event, saying the president "is a sexual predator and rapist." The university said the group that sponsored the event, called the "Knights for Socialism," is not a registered student group and is not officially affiliated with the school.

Gayle McCormick, 73, a Democrat, had not previously fought about politics with her conservative husband, but she felt "betrayed" by his decision to vote for Trump, Reuters reports. "It totally undid me that he could vote for Trump," McCormick said. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 13 percent of Americans had ended relationships over the presidential election.

Up until this point, investigators had been unable to verify the claims asserted in the document, which was compiled by a retired British intelligence agent and revealed to the public Jan. 10. CNN said that while the dossier's more "salacious" claims remain unverified, investigators have corroborated details about some of the communications "between senior Russian officials and other Russian individuals." The dossier includes "a dozen" conversations between foreign nationals, and investigators have been able to confirm that "some of the conversations described in the dossier took place between the same individuals on the same days and from the same locations as detailed in the dossier" after intercepting communications during "routine intelligence gathering," CNN said. Some of the individuals involved in the intercepted communications were previously found to be "heavily involved" in leaking information from Democratic organizations that proved harmful to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. CNN did not reveal specifics, including whether these latest findings are at all connected to Trump, but the confirmations have given U.S. intelligence "greater confidence" in the dossier's credibility. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer responded to CNN's request for comment combatively: "We continue to be disgusted by CNN's fake news reporting," Spicer said, echoing Trump's previous dismissals of the reports as "phony stuff." Spokespeople for various intelligence agencies declined to comment.

"To be honest, the idea of a 'trophy girl' has felt antiquated for some time now," Portnow said in a statement. "Who wrote that rule anyway? The ability to present a trophy has nothing to do with one's gender." Portnow explained the change wasn't intended to be "provocative or buck convention," The Associated Press noted, but to recognize that "music's universal power lies in its spirit of inclusion." The three trophy handlers for the 2017 Grammys are transgender model Martina Robledo, model and actor Derek Marrocco, and model and actress Hollin Haley. The Grammys will be hosted by James Corden and air Sunday, Feb. 12 on CBS at 8 p.m. ET. There will be performances by Chance the Rapper, who is nominated for seven Grammy awards, as well as Beyoncé, Adele, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga and Metallica, and Carrie Underwood and Keith Urban.

The gathering was intended to be a discussion about Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. Politico reported that as soon as reporters exited the room, Trump began telling the group of senators how both he and former Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) — who lost her re-election bid and is now serving as a Capitol Hill liaison for Trump on Gorsuch's nomination — were victims of a rigged election. Ayotte was in the room, as was White House Counsel Don McGahn. Trump obviously won the election, but he narrowly lost New Hampshire to Hillary Clinton. He told senators Thursday that was because of the "thousands" of people "brought in on buses" from Massachusetts to "illegally vote" in New Hampshire. The room reportedly responded with an "uncomfortable silence." Trump indicated that this voter fraud, of which there is no evidence, had also affected Ayotte, though he suggested her loss might have also had something to do with her decision to distance herself from him after he criticized the parents of a Muslim Gold Star soldier. "He told her, 'You'd have won if you'd been on my train," a participant told Politico. Then, as the cherry on top of that crumbling cake, Trump told Democrats he was glad "Pocahontas" — his chosen nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — was "becoming the face of 'your party,'" Politico reported. Trump has repeatedly claimed millions voted illegally in the presidential election, causing him to lose the popular vote to Clinton, but he has yet to produce any evidence to substantiate those claims.

New research by scientists at Kyoto University has found that dogs judge humans based on how they treat other people, New Scientist reports: … The researchers tested whether dogs preferred people who helped their owner. Each owner tried to open a container then presented it to one of two actors. This actor either helped or refused to do so, while the other actor was passive. Then the two actors offered the dog a reward and it chose between them. The dogs had no preference when the first actor had helped their owner, but were more likely to choose the passive actor if the first one had refused to help. [New Scientist] Dogs evolved closely alongside humans, which means they are particularly sensitive to how people act. The Kyoto study also tested monkeys, and found similar results, with the primates preferring people who acted kindly or generously. Even human morality might be evolutionary: "I think that in humans there may be this basic sensitivity towards antisocial behavior in others. Then through growing up, inculturation and teaching, it develops into a full-blown sense of morality,” said comparative psychologist James Anderson. Watch the dogs make judgments in the study below.

Having decried student debt (not to mention universities’ inculcation of political correctness), he endeavored to make the case that college was a limiting and outdated model. The Thiel Fellowship, as it came to be known, was representative of a particular strain of anti-establishmentarianism in tech-industry culture. Who needs higher education? In Valley of the Gods: A Silicon Valley Story, Alexandra Wolfe, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, zooms in on a handful of Thiel fellows from the 2011 inaugural class. Among them are John Burnham, an antsy teen who has his sights set on asteroid-mining robots; Laura Deming, a prodigy working on life extension; and James Proud, who founded GigLocator, an app for locating tickets to live concerts, and sold the company in 2012. As the fellows adjust to their new environs in the Bay Area, Wolfe follows them into a constellation of mentors and affiliates, subcultures and institutions—“Silicon Valley’s elite and underbelly.” Her goal is a portrait of the tech industry as “a new social order, one with an anti-‘society’ aesthetic that has taken on a singular style.” Wolfe is an entertaining writer, if not an outstanding prose stylist, and she largely lets her subjects speak for themselves, skimping on broader context. Her subjects, mostly entrepreneurs, founders, and figureheads, are indisputably more elite than underbelly, but no matter. From the futurist and author Ray Kurzweil to Todd Huffman—a biologist, an early participant in the now-defunct San Francisco “intentional community” Langton Labs, and an aspiring cryogenically preserved corpse—Wolfe lands on characters who are vibrant and open-minded, each deserving of more inquiry than a 250-page book allows. The line between “tech company” and “regular company” continues to blur. Through visits to start-up incubators, communal-living groups in mansions, and polyamorous households on Paleo diets, Wolfe constructs an argument that in Silicon Valley, “institutions and routines such as raises, rents, mortgages—marriage—were as inconsequential, breakable, and flexible as the industries technology disrupted.” She deploys her anecdotes to serve her vision of the culture as a reaction to “the East Coast’s hierarchy,” as well as its foil. She pokes fun at the tech industry’s own self-aggrandizing fetishes while also affirming them. Incubators are “a sort of West Coast Ivy League,” a fast track to access and social capital. Millennials prefer the “freedom” of Silicon Valley to the “old world” of the East Coast. Gone is Wall Street’s uniform of Thomas Pink and Tiffany; in its stead, “the only outward signs of tech success are laptops and ideas.” Pitting East against West even gets ontological. Using New York City hedge-fund managers as an example, Wolfe writes that the “retrowealth” of the East Coast is “a harkening back to what it was to be human last century.” Silicon Valley, by contrast, has trained its sights on how to “disrupt, transgress, and reengineer … humanity as a whole.” Wolfe’s book spans five years, but the bulk of her reporting appears to be from 2011 and 2012. And a lot happened in the years between the cocky-nerd drama of 2010’s The Social Network and the first quarter of 2016, which brought zero initial public offerings from tech companies. In 2012, new start-ups were flush with money and the tech sphere was overwhelmed by ardent media coverage; the verb disrupt was elbowing its way into vernacular prominence and had not yet become a cliché. Facebook’s IPO was not only record-setting but a flag in the ground, and the West Coast seemed a hopeful counternarrative in an otherwise flailing economy. Stories about Silicon Valley were imbued with a certain awe that, today, is starting to fade. Since the genre’s takeoff in the late 1990s, during the first dot-com boom, writing about the tech industry has traditionally fallen into a few limited camps: buzzy and breathless blog posts pegged to product announcements, suspiciously redolent of press releases; technophobic and scolding accounts heralding the downfall of society via smartphone; dry business reporting; and lifestyle coverage zeroing in on the trappings, trends, and celebrities of the tech scene. In different ways, each neglects to examine the industry’s cultural clout and political economy. This tendency is shifting, as the line between “tech company” and “regular company” continues to blur (even Walmart has an innovation lab in the Bay Area). Founders and their publicists would have you believe that this is a world of pioneers and utopians, cowboy coders and hero programmers. But as tech becomes more pervasive, coverage that unquestioningly echoes the mythologizing impulse is falling out of fashion. Portraying Silicon Valley’s powerful as “uber-nerds” is reductive and unhelpful. The backlash is unsurprising. Accelerated, venture-capital-fueled success is bound to inspire more than just wonder. In the past year alone, three Silicon Valley darlings—Hampton Creek, Theranos, and Zenefits—have been subject to painful debunking by the media. Thiel’s own reputation, always controversial, has come into question since his financing of a lawsuit that shuttered Gawker and his emergence as an avid Donald Trump supporter. Valley of the Gods, which opens with a tribute to Thiel and the “counterintuitive idealism” he aimed to encourage, feels like a time capsule from a previous iteration of tech media, a reminder of the sort of narratives that have contributed to growing impatience with the mythos. Valley of the Gods is fine as an artifact hurtled from a more innocent time, as far as scene-driven reportage is concerned. But what feels like a throwback perspective takes a toll on the larger argument of Wolfe’s book. She relies at every turn on stereotypes such as “Asperger’s Chic” and “engineering geeks [who]barely knew how to make friends or navigate a cocktail party, let alone be politically manipulative.” Statements like “Only the young and ambitious who grew up with the computer saw it for what it might become” aren’t just vaguely ageist, but also ahistorical. (What the computer has thus far “become” is only one version of many potential outcomes and visions.) Peter Thiel’s friends, in her summation, are part of “a whole new world of often-wacky people and ideas that didn’t seem to subscribe to any set principles or social awareness.” Leaning on Silicon Valley tropes, Wolfe fails to take her subjects—and their economic and political influence, which has only increased over the past five years—seriously. From Our March 2017 Issue Try 2 FREE issues of The Atlantic Subscribe She also undercuts her own point about the disruptive ethos of the place. “Today’s uber-nerds are like the robber barons of the industrial revolution whose steel and automobile manufacturing capabilities changed entire industries,” she writes. “But instead of massive factories and mills, they’re doing it with little buttons.” Portraying Silicon Valley’s powerful as “uber-nerds” who struck it rich is as reductive and unhelpful as referring to technology that integrates personal payment information and location tracking as “little buttons.” The effect is not only to protect them behind the shield of presumed harmlessness, but also to exempt them from the scrutiny that their economic and political power should invite. The sort of mythology that celebrates a small handful of visionaries and co-founders blurs important social realities. Technology has always been a collective project. The industry is also cyclical. Many failed ideas have been resuscitated and rebranded as successful products and services, owned and managed by people other than their originators. Behind almost every popular app or website today lie numerous shadow versions that have been sloughed away by time. Yet recognition of the group nature of the enterprise would undermine a myth that legitimizes the consolidation of profit, for the most part, among a small group of people. If technology belongs to the people only insofar as the people are consumers, we beneficiaries had better believe that luminaries and pioneers did something so outrageously, so individually innovative that the concentration of capital at the top is deserved. When founders pitch their companies, or inscribe their origin stories into the annals of TechCrunch, they neglect to mention some of the most important variables of success: luck, timing, connections, and those who set the foundation for them. The industry isn’t terribly in touch with its own history. It clings tight to a faith in meritocracy: This is a spaceship, and we built it by ourselves. After four years of working in tech, almost all of which were spent at start-ups in San Francisco, I’ll happily acknowledge that the industry contains multitudes: biohackers and anti-aging advocates, high-flying techno-utopians and high-strung co-founders, polyamorous couples and M.B.A.s. But they’re just people, and their lifestyle choices are usually in the minority. They’re not a new social order. Even if they were, plenty of people just like them live in New York City, too. Simon & Schuster Valley of the Gods is journalism, not ethnography. As with any caricature, the world depicted in its pages is largely an exaggeration—even, in some cases, a fantasy—but certain dimensions ring true, and loudly. It’s important to note what Wolfe gets right. This is a culture that champions acceleration, optimization, and efficiency. From communication to attire, some things are more casual than they are on the East Coast, and people seem to be happier for it. Irreverence is often rewarded. This is far from punk rock (the irreverence is often in the name of building financially successful corporations), but experimentation is encouraged. Silicon Valley is hardly a meritocracy—diversity metrics make that clear, and old-school credentials and pedigree still have clout out west—but it’s more meritocratic than other, older industries like consulting or finance. Few women figure in Wolfe’s book, which also feels accurate, especially at the higher levels. The trouble with telling “a Silicon Valley story” is that the real stories are not just more nuanced and moderate but also relatively boring. Many people working in technology are legitimately inspiring, but they don’t necessarily gravitate toward flashy projects, and won’t be found strolling across a ted stage. If they fail, they may not fail up, and they certainly won’t write a Medium post afterward in an attempt to micromanage their personal brand or reconfigure the narrative. The other, less flattering truth is that the difference between the East and West Coasts is not fundamentally all that great. The tech industry owes a huge debt to the financial sector. Wolfe is eager to depict Silicon Valley as the new New York, but much of the money that funds venture-capital firms comes from investors who made their fortunes on Wall Street. (The tech industry also owes a great debt to “Main Street”: Private-equity funds regularly include allocations from public pension plans and universities.) Cultural differences abound, but they’re not a function of the tech industry. They’re a function of history, of the deeply entrenched cultural and social circumstances that slowly come to define a place. As the mythology gets worn away, the contours of the Valley become easier to see. The view, though less glamorous, still offers plenty to behold. Share Tweet Comments Latest Video The Crippling Fear of Everlasting Life While many dream of an afterlife, people with apeirophobia are terrified of eternal existence. Caitlin Cadieux and Daniel Lombroso Feb 8, 2017 About the Author Anna Wiener is a writer based in San Francisco. Her work has appeared in the New Republic, Pacific Standard, and The Paris Review. Most Popular Presented by Kevin Lamarque / Reuters Behind the Internet's Anti-Democracy Movement Rosie Gray White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is reportedly a reader of neoreactionary political theory. A tour through the pro-authoritarian philosophy gaining visibility on the right. White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has been in contact via intermediaries with Curtis Yarvin, Politico Magazine reported this week. Yarvin, a software engineer and blogger, writes under the name Mencius Moldbug. His anti-egalitarian arguments have formed the basis for a movement called “neoreaction.” The main thrust of Yarvin’s thinking is that democracy is a bust; rule by the people doesn’t work, and doesn’t lead to good governance. He has described it as an “ineffective and destructive” form of government, which he associates with “war, tyranny, destruction and poverty.” Yarvin’s ideas, along with those of the English philosopher Nick Land, have provided a structure of political theory for parts of the white-nationalist movement calling itself the alt-right. The alt-right can be seen as a political movement; neoreaction, which adherents refer to as NRx, is a philosophy. At the core of that philosophy is a rejection of democracy and an embrace of autocratic rule.

Here’s the playbook Donald Trump could use to set the country down a path toward illiberalism. It’s 2021, and President Donald Trump will shortly be sworn in for his second term. The 45th president has visibly aged over the past four years. He rests heavily on his daughter Ivanka’s arm during his infrequent public appearances. Fortunately for him, he did not need to campaign hard for reelection. His has been a popular presidency: Big tax cuts, big spending, and big deficits have worked their familiar expansive magic. Wages have grown strongly in the Trump years, especially for men without a college degree, even if rising inflation is beginning to bite into the gains. The president’s supporters credit his restrictive immigration policies and his TrumpWorks infrastructure program.

Sean Spicer has never found his stride. Kellyanne Conway is in Congress’s sights. Welcome to Survivor: West Wing. It is a truth universally peddled by wisemen and -women in Washington, though not necessarily obeyed by presidents, that when the White House is in trouble, the best cure is to hoist the head of an adviser on a spike of the fence encircling the executive mansion. Firing—sorry, accepting the resignation of—an adviser makes for an easy way to demonstrate that the administration understands it has a problem and is working to fix it. That person doesn’t necessarily need to be the root of the problem, though it’s helpful if they’re at least somewhat involved. Other times, some bad press offers a useful pretext for pushing out someone who was already on thin ice.

We can renegotiate terms.” Ah, love. The above line is delivered to Anastasia Steele by Christian Grey near the beginning of Fifty Shades Darker, the second movie adaptation of the trilogy of zillion-selling erotic novels by Erika Mitchell (pen name E. L. James). But one imagines similar words being spoken by executives of Universal Pictures to Mitchell herself following the completion of the first installment in the series, Fifty Shades of Grey. That film was directed by the respected artist Sam (short for Samantha) Taylor-Johnson, and she and Mitchell reportedly fought over almost every aspect of the production, the latter having been granted uncommon creative control when she signed over the rights to her books.

Unusually for a person with such a background, he had been a Trump supporter even during the Republican primaries. Now, though, he was worried. The new National Security Council leadership was taking form—and he feared he saw history repeating itself. “The National Security Council,” he warned, “is not one executive body. It is a deliberative body.” But the new national security adviser, General Michael Flynn, obviously hungered to carry out policy, not merely preside over policy formation. That way lay the disaster that had befallen Reagan's national security advisers Bud Macfarlane and John Poindexter in the 1980s, who were convicted of lying to Congress about the administration selling arms to Iran to finance anti-communist militants in Nicaragua.

The Wall Street Journal’s editorial features editor has left the paper following tensions over the section drifting in a pro-Donald Trump direction. News of the departure of Mark Lasswell, who edited op-eds for the Journal, comes as the paper’s internal tensions over Trump have begun to spill into public view. The reliably hawkish, pro-trade, small government conservative Journal op-ed page has been challenged by the rise of the populist, nationalist Trump movement. The Journal’s opinion pages have been a showcase for the intra-right divide over Trump, featuring Trump-sympathetic writers like Bill McGurn alongside anti-Trump columnists such as Bret Stephens. Lasswell appears to be a casualty of that divide, and his dismissal a victory for the pro-Trump faction on the editorial staff.

And yet, for years, he suspected his mind had been taken over by parasites that had invaded his brain. So the prolific biologist took his science-fiction hunch into the lab. What he’s now discovering will startle you. Could tiny organisms carried by house cats be creeping into our brains, causing everything from car wrecks to schizophrenia? No one would accuse Jaroslav Flegr of being a conformist. A self-described “sloppy dresser,” the 53-year-old Czech scientist has the contemplative air of someone habitually lost in thought, and his still-youthful, square-jawed face is framed by frizzy red hair that encircles his head like a ring of fire. Certainly Flegr’s thinking is jarringly unconventional. Starting in the early 1990s, he began to suspect that a single-celled parasite in the protozoan family was subtly manipulating his personality, causing him to behave in strange, often self-destructive ways. And if it was messing with his mind, he reasoned, it was probably doing the same to others. The parasite, which is excreted by cats in their feces, is called Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii or Toxo for short) and is the microbe that causes toxoplasmosis—the reason pregnant women are told to avoid cats’ litter boxes. Since the 1920s, doctors have recognized that a woman who becomes infected during pregnancy can transmit the disease to the fetus, in some cases resulting in severe brain damage or death. T. gondii is also a major threat to people with weakened immunity: in the early days of the AIDS epidemic, before good antiretroviral drugs were developed, it was to blame for the dementia that afflicted many patients at the disease’s end stage. Healthy children and adults, however, usually experience nothing worse than brief flu-like symptoms before quickly fighting off the protozoan, which thereafter lies dormant inside brain cells—or at least that’s the standard medical wisdom.

Having decried student debt (not to mention universities’ inculcation of political correctness), he endeavored to make the case that college was a limiting and outdated model. The Thiel Fellowship, as it came to be known, was representative of a particular strain of anti-establishmentarianism in tech-industry culture. Who needs higher education? In Valley of the Gods: A Silicon Valley Story, Alexandra Wolfe, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, zooms in on a handful of Thiel fellows from the 2011 inaugural class. Among them are John Burnham, an antsy teen who has his sights set on asteroid-mining robots; Laura Deming, a prodigy working on life extension; and James Proud, who founded GigLocator, an app for locating tickets to live concerts, and sold the company in 2012. As the fellows adjust to their new environs in the Bay Area, Wolfe follows them into a constellation of mentors and affiliates, subcultures and institutions—“Silicon Valley’s elite and underbelly.” Her goal is a portrait of the tech industry as “a new social order, one with an anti-‘society’ aesthetic that has taken on a singular style.” Wolfe is an entertaining writer, if not an outstanding prose stylist, and she largely lets her subjects speak for themselves, skimping on broader context. Her subjects, mostly entrepreneurs, founders, and figureheads, are indisputably more elite than underbelly, but no matter. From the futurist and author Ray Kurzweil to Todd Huffman—a biologist, an early participant in the now-defunct San Francisco “intentional community” Langton Labs, and an aspiring cryogenically preserved corpse—Wolfe lands on characters who are vibrant and open-minded, each deserving of more inquiry than a 250-page book allows. The line between “tech company” and “regular company” continues to blur. Through visits to start-up incubators, communal-living groups in mansions, and polyamorous households on Paleo diets, Wolfe constructs an argument that in Silicon Valley, “institutions and routines such as raises, rents, mortgages—marriage—were as inconsequential, breakable, and flexible as the industries technology disrupted.” She deploys her anecdotes to serve her vision of the culture as a reaction to “the East Coast’s hierarchy,” as well as its foil. She pokes fun at the tech industry’s own self-aggrandizing fetishes while also affirming them. Incubators are “a sort of West Coast Ivy League,” a fast track to access and social capital. Millennials prefer the “freedom” of Silicon Valley to the “old world” of the East Coast. Gone is Wall Street’s uniform of Thomas Pink and Tiffany; in its stead, “the only outward signs of tech success are laptops and ideas.” Pitting East against West even gets ontological. Using New York City hedge-fund managers as an example, Wolfe writes that the “retrowealth” of the East Coast is “a harkening back to what it was to be human last century.” Silicon Valley, by contrast, has trained its sights on how to “disrupt, transgress, and reengineer … humanity as a whole.” Wolfe’s book spans five years, but the bulk of her reporting appears to be from 2011 and 2012. And a lot happened in the years between the cocky-nerd drama of 2010’s The Social Network and the first quarter of 2016, which brought zero initial public offerings from tech companies. In 2012, new start-ups were flush with money and the tech sphere was overwhelmed by ardent media coverage; the verb disrupt was elbowing its way into vernacular prominence and had not yet become a cliché. Facebook’s IPO was not only record-setting but a flag in the ground, and the West Coast seemed a hopeful counternarrative in an otherwise flailing economy. Stories about Silicon Valley were imbued with a certain awe that, today, is starting to fade. Since the genre’s takeoff in the late 1990s, during the first dot-com boom, writing about the tech industry has traditionally fallen into a few limited camps: buzzy and breathless blog posts pegged to product announcements, suspiciously redolent of press releases; technophobic and scolding accounts heralding the downfall of society via smartphone; dry business reporting; and lifestyle coverage zeroing in on the trappings, trends, and celebrities of the tech scene. In different ways, each neglects to examine the industry’s cultural clout and political economy. This tendency is shifting, as the line between “tech company” and “regular company” continues to blur (even Walmart has an innovation lab in the Bay Area). Founders and their publicists would have you believe that this is a world of pioneers and utopians, cowboy coders and hero programmers. But as tech becomes more pervasive, coverage that unquestioningly echoes the mythologizing impulse is falling out of fashion. Portraying Silicon Valley’s powerful as “uber-nerds” is reductive and unhelpful. The backlash is unsurprising. Accelerated, venture-capital-fueled success is bound to inspire more than just wonder. In the past year alone, three Silicon Valley darlings—Hampton Creek, Theranos, and Zenefits—have been subject to painful debunking by the media. Thiel’s own reputation, always controversial, has come into question since his financing of a lawsuit that shuttered Gawker and his emergence as an avid Donald Trump supporter. Valley of the Gods, which opens with a tribute to Thiel and the “counterintuitive idealism” he aimed to encourage, feels like a time capsule from a previous iteration of tech media, a reminder of the sort of narratives that have contributed to growing impatience with the mythos. Valley of the Gods is fine as an artifact hurtled from a more innocent time, as far as scene-driven reportage is concerned. But what feels like a throwback perspective takes a toll on the larger argument of Wolfe’s book. She relies at every turn on stereotypes such as “Asperger’s Chic” and “engineering geeks [who]barely knew how to make friends or navigate a cocktail party, let alone be politically manipulative.” Statements like “Only the young and ambitious who grew up with the computer saw it for what it might become” aren’t just vaguely ageist, but also ahistorical. (What the computer has thus far “become” is only one version of many potential outcomes and visions.) Peter Thiel’s friends, in her summation, are part of “a whole new world of often-wacky people and ideas that didn’t seem to subscribe to any set principles or social awareness.” Leaning on Silicon Valley tropes, Wolfe fails to take her subjects—and their economic and political influence, which has only increased over the past five years—seriously. From Our March 2017 Issue Try 2 FREE issues of The Atlantic Subscribe She also undercuts her own point about the disruptive ethos of the place. “Today’s uber-nerds are like the robber barons of the industrial revolution whose steel and automobile manufacturing capabilities changed entire industries,” she writes. “But instead of massive factories and mills, they’re doing it with little buttons.” Portraying Silicon Valley’s powerful as “uber-nerds” who struck it rich is as reductive and unhelpful as referring to technology that integrates personal payment information and location tracking as “little buttons.” The effect is not only to protect them behind the shield of presumed harmlessness, but also to exempt them from the scrutiny that their economic and political power should invite. The sort of mythology that celebrates a small handful of visionaries and co-founders blurs important social realities. Technology has always been a collective project. The industry is also cyclical. Many failed ideas have been resuscitated and rebranded as successful products and services, owned and managed by people other than their originators. Behind almost every popular app or website today lie numerous shadow versions that have been sloughed away by time. Yet recognition of the group nature of the enterprise would undermine a myth that legitimizes the consolidation of profit, for the most part, among a small group of people. If technology belongs to the people only insofar as the people are consumers, we beneficiaries had better believe that luminaries and pioneers did something so outrageously, so individually innovative that the concentration of capital at the top is deserved. When founders pitch their companies, or inscribe their origin stories into the annals of TechCrunch, they neglect to mention some of the most important variables of success: luck, timing, connections, and those who set the foundation for them. The industry isn’t terribly in touch with its own history. It clings tight to a faith in meritocracy: This is a spaceship, and we built it by ourselves. After four years of working in tech, almost all of which were spent at start-ups in San Francisco, I’ll happily acknowledge that the industry contains multitudes: biohackers and anti-aging advocates, high-flying techno-utopians and high-strung co-founders, polyamorous couples and M.B.A.s. But they’re just people, and their lifestyle choices are usually in the minority. They’re not a new social order. Even if they were, plenty of people just like them live in New York City, too. Simon & Schuster Valley of the Gods is journalism, not ethnography. As with any caricature, the world depicted in its pages is largely an exaggeration—even, in some cases, a fantasy—but certain dimensions ring true, and loudly. It’s important to note what Wolfe gets right. This is a culture that champions acceleration, optimization, and efficiency. From communication to attire, some things are more casual than they are on the East Coast, and people seem to be happier for it. Irreverence is often rewarded. This is far from punk rock (the irreverence is often in the name of building financially successful corporations), but experimentation is encouraged. Silicon Valley is hardly a meritocracy—diversity metrics make that clear, and old-school credentials and pedigree still have clout out west—but it’s more meritocratic than other, older industries like consulting or finance. Few women figure in Wolfe’s book, which also feels accurate, especially at the higher levels. The trouble with telling “a Silicon Valley story” is that the real stories are not just more nuanced and moderate but also relatively boring. Many people working in technology are legitimately inspiring, but they don’t necessarily gravitate toward flashy projects, and won’t be found strolling across a ted stage. If they fail, they may not fail up, and they certainly won’t write a Medium post afterward in an attempt to micromanage their personal brand or reconfigure the narrative. The other, less flattering truth is that the difference between the East and West Coasts is not fundamentally all that great. The tech industry owes a huge debt to the financial sector. Wolfe is eager to depict Silicon Valley as the new New York, but much of the money that funds venture-capital firms comes from investors who made their fortunes on Wall Street. (The tech industry also owes a great debt to “Main Street”: Private-equity funds regularly include allocations from public pension plans and universities.) Cultural differences abound, but they’re not a function of the tech industry. They’re a function of history, of the deeply entrenched cultural and social circumstances that slowly come to define a place. As the mythology gets worn away, the contours of the Valley become easier to see. The view, though less glamorous, still offers plenty to behold.

Caitlin Cadieux and Daniel Lombroso Feb 8, 2017 About the Author Anna Wiener is a writer based in San Francisco. Her work has appeared in the New Republic, Pacific Standard, and The Paris Review. Most Popular Presented by Kevin Lamarque / Reuters Behind the Internet's Anti-Democracy Movement Rosie Gray White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is reportedly a reader of neoreactionary political theory. A tour through the pro-authoritarian philosophy gaining visibility on the right. White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has been in contact via intermediaries with Curtis Yarvin, Politico Magazine reported this week. Yarvin, a software engineer and blogger, writes under the name Mencius Moldbug. His anti-egalitarian arguments have formed the basis for a movement called “neoreaction.” The main thrust of Yarvin’s thinking is that democracy is a bust; rule by the people doesn’t work, and doesn’t lead to good governance. He has described it as an “ineffective and destructive” form of government, which he associates with “war, tyranny, destruction and poverty.” Yarvin’s ideas, along with those of the English philosopher Nick Land, have provided a structure of political theory for parts of the white-nationalist movement calling itself the alt-right. The alt-right can be seen as a political movement; neoreaction, which adherents refer to as NRx, is a philosophy. At the core of that philosophy is a rejection of democracy and an embrace of autocratic rule.

Here’s the playbook Donald Trump could use to set the country down a path toward illiberalism. It’s 2021, and President Donald Trump will shortly be sworn in for his second term. The 45th president has visibly aged over the past four years. He rests heavily on his daughter Ivanka’s arm during his infrequent public appearances. Fortunately for him, he did not need to campaign hard for reelection. His has been a popular presidency: Big tax cuts, big spending, and big deficits have worked their familiar expansive magic. Wages have grown strongly in the Trump years, especially for men without a college degree, even if rising inflation is beginning to bite into the gains. The president’s supporters credit his restrictive immigration policies and his TrumpWorks infrastructure program.

Sean Spicer has never found his stride. Kellyanne Conway is in Congress’s sights. Welcome to Survivor: West Wing. It is a truth universally peddled by wisemen and -women in Washington, though not necessarily obeyed by presidents, that when the White House is in trouble, the best cure is to hoist the head of an adviser on a spike of the fence encircling the executive mansion. Firing—sorry, accepting the resignation of—an adviser makes for an easy way to demonstrate that the administration understands it has a problem and is working to fix it. That person doesn’t necessarily need to be the root of the problem, though it’s helpful if they’re at least somewhat involved. Other times, some bad press offers a useful pretext for pushing out someone who was already on thin ice.

We can renegotiate terms.” Ah, love. The above line is delivered to Anastasia Steele by Christian Grey near the beginning of Fifty Shades Darker, the second movie adaptation of the trilogy of zillion-selling erotic novels by Erika Mitchell (pen name E. L. James). But one imagines similar words being spoken by executives of Universal Pictures to Mitchell herself following the completion of the first installment in the series, Fifty Shades of Grey. That film was directed by the respected artist Sam (short for Samantha) Taylor-Johnson, and she and Mitchell reportedly fought over almost every aspect of the production, the latter having been granted uncommon creative control when she signed over the rights to her books. The result was a very bad movie, but one considerably less bad than the book it was based on.

Mike Rowe, Greg Gutfeld, and... and, yes, Reason's own Nick Gillespie, in "From Millennial To Man." Nick Gillespie|Feb. 7, 2017 4:10 pm Over at Medium, memoirist, columnist, and podcaster Lisa De Pasquale offers up a libertarian-conservative version of a threatened reboot of the fun old series Queer Eye for the Straight Guy (the show ran from 2003 to 2007, back in a simpler America when Carson wasn't simply a generic name for a mediocre pro-football quarterback). According to its producers, the new Queer Eye is going to fan out into red-state America and, presumably, enlighten men unironically shopping for food and clothes at Walmart, Meijer, and Target (no longer cool like it once way). De Pasquale counters with: I would love to see a reality show that improves men's lives and skills, especially for the millennials who seem to be struggling with "adulting." Sure there are some straight guys who might need some polishing, but let's be honest: there are also some guys who could use a little roughing up, too. Here are my ideas for a new reality show called "From Millennial to Man." These experts can turn Pajama Boy into a productive member of society. Among the experts she selects are Mike Rowe, Greg Gutfeld, Chris Barron, Terry Schappert, Cam Edwards, Tyrus, and yours truly: I think "Queer Eye" cohost Carson Kressley, who was just terminated on "The Celebrity Apprentice," would agree that having a personal style is more important than following trends. You'll never see Reason.tv and libertarian writer Nick Gillespie wearing skinny jeans, but you will see him in his trademark black leather jacket and blacker coif. After all, branding is just as important as style. Gillespie can also provide some inspiration on decorating. Forget setting the mood with wine and music. Nothing is more seductive than a man who actually has art on his walls. Read the whole thing here. Here's the interview Reason did with De Pasquale in 2014, when her excellent, funny, and deeply disturbing memoir Finding Mr. Righteous came out: Nick Gillespie is the editor in chief of Reason.com and Reason TV and the co-author, with Matt Welch, of The Declaration of Independents: How Libertarian Politics Can Fix What's Wrong With America (2011/2012). He is also a columnist for The Daily Beast.

The international chain, with more than 300 locations now open, announced the highlights and financial results for its fiscal year 2016 and the outlook for 2017, saying it has achieved a 4.4 percent increase in comparable same-store sales. The 2016 fourth quarter also marked the 12th straight consecutive quarter it recorded same-store sales growth. 2016 also saw continued non-traditional unit growth for the company, including the opening of Wetzel’s locations at multiple Walmart locations, and in Manhattan’s Fulton Center, with daily foot traffic exceeding 300,000. The company opened 23 units, including the company’s first Saudi Arabia location. “While the restaurant sector was essentially flat in 2016, Wetzel’s continued to drive same-store sales increases,” said Bill Phelps, co-founder and CEO of Wetzel’s Pretzels. “We attribute this growth to a variety of factors, including offering the best-tasting, freshest product, exceptional customer service and a corporate philosophy that places a priority on franchise profitability.” In 2016, Wetzel’s Pretzels also launched its user-friendly app for iOS and Android devices, allowing for both mobile pay and e-gift cards. For 2017, the company intends to continue its expansion within many other Walmart locations, and will be recruiting multi-unit developers to expand into strategic areas of the country. It will also launch a new Bitz flavor, following on the heels of Pizza Bitz, one of the most successful new product introductions in the company’s history. Pizza Bitz accounted for up to 10 percent of net sales across the system. “There is tremendous white space for Wetzel’s Pretzels both domestically and internationally,” Phelps said. “With our strong unit economics and same-store sales growth, we expect to capitalize on those opportunities by recruiting more multi-unit developers into our system and offering incentives for growth.” Phelps and Rick Wetzel opened the first Wetzel’s Pretzels bakery in Redondo Beach in 1994. Today, the company has grown to more than 300 fresh bakeries across the U.S. and around the world, with premier locations at Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World Resort.

Biosolar (OTCMKTS:BSRC) VENTURA , CALIFORNIA , USA, February 7, 2017 / — Ventura, CA, Feb 07, 2016 Biosolar, Inc. (OTCMKTS: BSRC) (BRSC or “The Company”) an innovative biotech company focused on battery technology research and development, signed a joint venture agreement with an established solar power manufacturer and technology based company, This will secure a foothold in the company in the multi-billion dollar clean energy industry.  Biosolar Inc will share research, development, and manufacturing spaces with texas Solar in order to explore various expertise synergies.

About BioSolar: BioSolar is developing a breakthrough technology to increase the storage capacity, lower the cost and extend the life of lithium-ion batteries. A battery contains two major parts, a cathode and an anode, that function together as the positive and negative sides. BioSolar initially focused its development effort on high capacity cathode materials since most of today’s Li-ion batteries are “cathode limited.” With the goal of creating the company’s next generation super-battery technology, BioSolar is currently investigating high capacity anode materials recognizing the fact that the overall battery capacity is determined by the combination of both cathode and anode. By integrating BioSolar’s high capacity cathode or anode, battery manufacturers will be able to create a super lithium-ion battery that can double the range of a Tesla, power an iPhone for two days straight, or store daytime solar energy for nighttime use. Founded with the vision of developing breakthrough energy technologies, BioSolar’s previous successes include the world’s first UL approved bio-based back sheet for use in solar panels.

(Photo: Land Rover) 5 CONNECTTWEET 4 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE As Washington considers a tax on imports, an auto industry study suggests the policy would deliver the sharpest blow to Tata Motors Ltd.’s Jaguar Land Rover while giving a leg up to Tesla Inc. and Ford Motor Co. In what it calls a “thought exercise,” industry researcher Baum & Associates LLC estimates that most automakers would need to raise vehicle prices by thousands of dollars — more than $17,000 per vehicle in Jaguar Land Rover’s case — to recoup higher costs incurred under the House Republican-proposed border-adjusted tax. Ford would need to mull the smallest price hike among major automakers, at about $282 per vehicle, followed by General Motors Co. at $995, according to the report. The estimates aim to show the relative impact of the tax plan on each automaker, according to Alan Baum, the founder of West Bloomfield, Michigan-based Baum & Associates. Carmakers are unlikely to raise prices by more than a few thousand dollars per car and would also likely have to foot some of the higher tax burden. “The plan results in a net cost for automakers,” Baumsaid by phone. “Each company will then make its own decisions on pricing in order to best compete and maximize its profits.” Volvo and VW vehicle prices would have to rise by about $7,600 and $6,800 on average, according to estimates by Baum & Associates, which advises suppliers. President Donald Trump is said to be warming to the border-adjusted tax after initially viewing it as too complicated. The proposal to begin levying companies’ imports and domestic sales and make exports tax-exempt would completely overhaul the U.S. tax code. General Electric Co. and Boeing Co. are among U.S. manufacturers getting behind the idea, while Toyota Motor Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are among the corporate giants warning it will result in costlier products ranging from food and clothing to gasoline and auto parts. The Baum & Associates report accounts for imports of both finished vehicles and parts for domestic cars that are made overseas. The one automaker that may be able to keep prices steady would be Model S sedan maker Tesla. The proposed border tax may induce automakers to boost U.S. parts procurement and production from existing vehicle assembly plants, according to the report. Overseas automakers including Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.’s Subaru, Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Mazda Motor Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. may also consider expanding existing U.S. operations or building new capacity. If auto sales slow, the tax would create an incentive for automakers to keep U.S. plants running at the expense of those in Canada and Mexico. That could encourage Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to accelerate the conversion of its factory in Sterling Heights to build light-duty pickups there instead of Mexico, and to add medium- and heavy-duty truck output at the plant, said Dan Luria, an economist at the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center in Ann Arbor and the lead author of the Baum & Associates report. Nissan Motor Co. might export more from Mexico to Latin American markets and less to the U.S. Volkswagen AG could build another U.S. assembly plant. Mazda and Mitsubishi, which rely entirely on imports to the U.S. market, may have to quit the U.S. market or pay other manufacturers to assemble their cars, Luria said. In its current form, the proposed border tax could lead to the production of up to 1 million additional vehicles in the U.S. and 50,000 more jobs at car and part assembly plants, Luria said. In a separate report Wednesday, Colin Langan, an analyst at UBS Securities LLC, said the proposed border tax could raise average prices in the U.S. by about 8 percent, or $2,500 per vehicle. That’s enough to reduce annual sales by about 2 million vehicles, he said. Langan said he expects a draft bill to be released in late February or early March. He pegged the chances of a border tax being enacted at less than 50 percent. The tax has a good chance of making its way through the House of Representatives but is “very unlikely” to pass in the Senate, Langan said. 5 CONNECTTWEET 4 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2jZBpt4 TOP VIDEOS Mike Ilitch: 'I fell in love with Midwestern friendliness' 2:40 Microsoft moving to Detroit 3:49 Walking the floor at the NAIAS Charity Preview 1:00 Biden admires Detroit, 'an iconic city' 2:15 Chinese automaker GAC reveals three new vehicles 1:57 Mercedes-Benz introduces new cars 2:48 Infiniti introduces QX50 concept 1:19 2018 Honda Odyssey introduced 0:54 Nissan introduces Vmotion 2.0 concept, Rogue Sport SUV 1:25 2017 North American Car and Truck of the Year awards 2:03

Tracey Morgan, 48, suffered a broken leg, broken ribs, and several head injuries in June of 2014 after his tour bus crashed with a WalMart truck. The actor was left in a coma for two weeks. Lucky to call the supportive and beautiful @iammeganmorgan my wife! #anniversary A photo posted by Tracy Morgan (@realtracymorgan) on Aug 26, 2016 at 8:35pm PDT Morgan appeared on an episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Tuesday and assured everyone that he was doing much better. He and his wife, Megan Wollover, are even planning to have another baby soon, according to Page Six. “I bought my wife a house, it’s $20 million dollars … When we move in we’re going to have another baby. She promised me we can go for a boy as soon as we’re in our new house, so we’re starting tonight.” Chillin with my PYT A photo posted by Tracy Morgan (@realtracymorgan) on Feb 14, 2014 at 7:55am PST Tracy Morgan explained during his interview with Ellen DeGeneres that he had been so bored during his recovery that he and his wife had used the time to have “crazy” sex, role playing as Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna. “You gotta understand, for a whole year, I was on the couch, I couldn’t do nothin’, so when everything was working, I went crazy.” “Our sex life is so hot, it’s, like, volatile. We role-play, that’s how we keep it hot.” “Like tonight, she’s gonna dress up like Blac Chyna and I’m gonna put on a fat suit and be Rob Kardashian. Gotta keep it hot.” Ellen joked that maybe she would “go home and try that too.” Doctors gave him a 2% chance of living. Tomorrow, @RealTracyMorgan is back. A photo posted by Ellen (@theellenshow) on Feb 6, 2017 at 6:30pm PST Morgan also spoke about two other people that had helped him through his difficult recovery after the accident. “Maybe a week and half after I came out [of the coma], Eddie Murphy — I spoke to him on the phone, and he made me laugh.” “But I was heavily sedated … I chuckled, I laughed. When I got to give him his Mark Twain Award, I told him from the stage, ‘You’s the first one to make me laugh when I came back, and I love you for that.'” The 30 Rock star also spoke about his three-year-old daughter, Maven. Welcome to the school of Tracy Morgan #BonaFide A photo posted by Tracy Morgan (@realtracymorgan) on Apr 20, 2014 at 7:38pm PDT “I missed her first birthday because I was in a coma, but I got to see her take her first steps, and that inspired me and my wife to walk for the first time.” “I got out my wheelchair — my wife went crazy because my femur was still in little pieces, but she inspired me to get up and walk. I know my purpose in life now is to spread love.” The actor also has three sons, Malcolm, Gitrid, and Tracy Jr., from a previous marriage. All jokes aside, Tracy Morgan revealed that after his horrific crash, doctors had thought he would not survive, according to Daily Mail. “[Doctors] gave me a two percent chance of living, but God gave me a second chance.” The actor and comedian said that he appreciated the love and good will that everyone sent his way and that his daughter Maven played a huge part in helping him find the strength to walk again after being in a wheelchair for months. SEASONS GREETINGS from THE MORGANS! @iammeganmorgan ????:@tismanphoto A photo posted by Tracy Morgan (@realtracymorgan) on Dec 21, 2016 at 11:22am PST “There’s a lot of good will for me, and I feel like the Desmond Tutu of show business now,’ he joked. ‘I feel like Gandhi. And I just want to have the opportunity to give it back.” A preliminary investigation of the accident by the National Transportation Safety Board said that the driver of the truck was driving 65 mph in the 60 seconds before slamming into the tour bus.

During an appearance Tuesday on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show," Morgan joked that he and his wife, Megan Wollover, are trying to expand their family and have come up with ways to keep things interesting in the bedroom. "Our sex life is so hot," Morgan said, explaining that once everything below the waist started working properly again after his accident he went "crazy." "It's like volatile," he continued. "We roleplay - that's how we keep it hot. Tonight, she's gonna dress up like Blac Chyna and I'm gonna put on a fat suit and be Rob Kardashian." Tracy Morgan forgives Walmart truck driver who almost killed him Rob Kardashian and his fiance Blac Chyna have been dating since last year.  (Greg Doherty/Getty Images) DeGeneres laughed and told the comedian that she might go home "and do that, too." On a more serious note, Morgan also addressed his 2014 accident on the New Jersey Turnpike, in which a Walmart truck hit the minibus Morgan and his friends were riding in before smashing into three other vehicles. The crash killed Morgan's close friend, comedian James "Jimmy Mack" McNair dead and left Morgan in a coma. The comedian also suffered a brain injury and multiple broken bones.

(Evan Agostini/Evan Agostini/Invision/AP) The "30 Rock" actor, 48, told DeGeneres that he was inspired to walk again after watching his daughter Maven take her first steps. Tracy Morgan ordered to hand over documents in Walmart settlement "I missed her first birthday because I was in a coma, but I got to see her take her first steps and that inspired me," he said. "I got out my wheelchair and I started walking. ... She inspired me to get out of my wheelchair and walk."

 'What the president says, I have money riding on': The ripple effects of Trump's import-tax plan Christopher Woody Feb. 8, 2017, 8:33 AM 4,141 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Fiat 124 Spider Elaborazione Abarth. William Fierman When Jerry Phillips bought his business in 2009, the imports that sustained his sales mostly came from Europe. As a dealer in parts for vintage Alfa Romeo and Fiat automobiles, most of the parts sold by Phillips' company in Fort Worth, Texas, were going into cars from Italy. Phillips found, however, the parts didn't necessarily have the same origins as the cars they were paired with. "I discovered when I purchased the business that all the parts that we were buying from Europe, lo and behold, they were sourcing from overseas themselves, from Asia, so we began to source from Asia as well," Phillips told Business Insider. "We import parts from around the world, and we ship parts out every day around the world," he said. "We buy from the EU. We buy from Turkey. We buy from South America. We buy from China. We buy from a couple of other Asian nations. We buy from around the world." Phillips' company, which employs only five people, is one of many American small businesses — that is, wholesale or retail trade firms with 250 or fewer employees — that relies heavily on imports. More than 95% of US importers are firms of that size, according to Census data cited by The Wall Street Journal. The Trump administration has floated a 20% tax on imports as one possible way to pay for the wall the president wants to build on the US-Mexico border, estimated to cost $12 billion to $15 billion. (Trump's embrace of the border adjustment tax would appear to be a reversal of his stance on it from earlier in January.) President Donald Trump meets with, from left, PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi, Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman, and GM CEO Mary Barra at the first meeting of his Strategic and Policy Forum on February 3, 2017. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images While Trump's team first mentioned the 20% tax in relation to Mexican imports, Republican leadership has said it aligned with their boarder tax-reform plans, specifically the implementation of a border adjustment tax that would apply to all countries. Such a tax would only apply to goods imported to and sold in the US, and companies would only be able to deduct their local costs. Revenue generated by the new tax scheme would supposedly fund a reduction in the corporate tax rate, from 35% to 20%. Such a tax would have pronounced effects on Texas, which has a trade surplus with Mexico and through which flows 33% of Mexico's imports to the US. "Texas' number one trading partner by far is Mexico, and imposing a 20% tax on Mexican imports to fund a border wall would hurt the Texas economy," Texas Association of Business President Chris Wallace said at the end of January. "This proposal could mean a loss of jobs and a hit to state tax revenues." "Mexico doesn't pay for the wall," Jared Bernstein, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told Bloomberg in late January. "American consumers who shop at places that import, like Wal-mart and Target, pay for the wall ..." David McNew/Getty Images "I can easily see that businesses like ours would need to raise prices anywhere from 20% to 30% to cover these changes in the rules," Phillips told Business Insider, saying his company had a major presence in what he admitted was a "teeny, tiny market." "And my customers are very price conscious," he added. "It would be very difficult for us to continue to sell at the volume we are with a 20% to 30% price increase." With customers less willing to buy his goods, Phillips said, businesses down the line, like repair shops, would in turn see less business and employ fewer people. Concerns about barriers to imports are not limited to Texas businesses or to imports from Mexico. While large retailers like Walmart have more leverage to negotiate deals or to shop around for suppliers, smaller US companies would be hamstrung, unable to maintain current prices while selling higher-priced imports and unable to afford domestically manufactured goods. Mike Segar/Reuters Richard Woldenberg, chief executive of Learning Resources, a Illinois-based company with about 150 workers selling plastic educational toys sourced mostly from China, told The Journal that even with a lower corporate tax rate, the border adjustment tax would drive his tax bill up by four or five times, which would require him to hike prices and then see sales shrink. Jennifer Arenson, whose business, Global Sourcing Connection, employs 26 people and supplies uniforms and promotional items to Fortune 1000 companies, told The Journal that for a company the size of hers, running its own manufacturing operation "absolutely is not a realistic option." Arguments in favor of the tax are that it would benefit firms that are exporters or those that don't import goods. Some small businesses may in fact become more competitive in this scenario. The conservative Tax Foundation estimates that it would generate $1.1 trillion in revenue over 10 years, and, among other things, it would disincentivize offshoring of profits and jobs. Other advocates have said the dollar would rise in value, offsetting the impact of the tax on US businesses. If that adjustment doesn't come to fruition, companies big and small would be hit with higher prices for imports. "We keep our pricing stable, even when we, say, have to pay a little more for a product because of a fluctuation in the exchange rate that's not in our favor," Phillips said. "But, if we go to an import tax, that's going to be seen as a permanent change, not a fluctuation." "If it's permanent, we're going to move prices upward," he added. "There's just no question." David Ramos/Getty Images More broadly, the negative impact of a tax on imports may outstrip the benefits reaped. "From a macro perspective, from a broad tax perspective, the amount of revenue you're going to get is very low, the amount of distortions you're going to create is very high, the amount of trouble you're going to create for the US and the world economy is very large, and the distributional effects are not trivial," Adam Posen, a former policymaker at the Bank of England and the president of Peterson Institute for International Economics, said at a conference this month. The cost would be "actually very harmful," Posen added. Shoppers from Mexico and the US make their way down El Paso Street, November 10, 2006, in downtown El Paso, Texas. (AP Photo/Victor Calzada) The possible broader international blowback from such an import policy — disturbed relations with major trading partners like China and Mexico, potential action against US exporters by the World Trade Organization, and retaliatory tariffs — would redound on the US economy as well. Moreover, Phillips told Business Insider, with a global supply chain, good business relations are about more than just economics. "There are some parts I'll be buying from Turkey in the next couple of weeks, and it's a pretty big purchase for my small company," he said. "Turkey is a Muslim country, and we've instituted these travel restrictions ... on a number of Muslim countries, and the folks in Turkey may not be too happy about that." "I need to have a good rapport with my Turkish supplier. They need to trust me, and I need to trust them," Phillips added, chuckling. "What the president says I have money riding on."

Photographer: Photographer Name/Bloomberg The New Face of American Unemployment As the U.S. labor force crests again, a new complex of problems locks many Americans out of the workplace. By Jeanna Smialek and Patricia Laya Photographs by William Mebane Even at so-called full employment, some 20 million Americans are left behind. They’re looking for work, out of the labor force but unhappy about it, or report working part-time when they’d prefer more hours, according to data released last week. Their plight comes even as the U.S. flirts with what economists consider the maximum level of employment for the first time since before the recession, having added 15.8 million jobs since the start of 2010. While some of America’s jobless are simply between gigs, those persistently stuck out of work are called the structurally unemployed. President Donald Trump said wrongly last month that 96 million people are looking for work, having included Americans who are still in school, retired, or just uninterested. Yet his words resonated in a country where economic insecurity is distributed unequally and cruelly—far deeper in Mingo, W. Va., than in midtown Manhattan. Because of where the structurally unemployed live, what they’ve done, or the skills they lack, employers can’t or won’t hire them. The problems that keep today's jobless stuck on the sidelines are different than those of past recoveries: a complex web of often interrelated issues from disability and drug use to criminal records. Behind the statistics are people with 20 million unique stories. Here are five. The border country of West Virginia and Kentucky presents few economic opportunities for young people. Photographer: Photographer Name/Bloomberg Fighting To Get Out of Mingo, W. Va. by Jeanna Smialek Tweet Tyler Moore’s late-December drive to Louisville, Ky., was one of desperation. He was headed four hours west on Interstate 64 to interview for a job. Even if he landed the position, filling his gas tank had left him with $8 to his name. He would have to sleep at a friend’s place until he could earn enough to pay rent. The 23-year-old had run out of options. He’d applied for dozens of jobs within an hour and a half of his hometown of Lovely, once a coal-mining stronghold. Instead of opportunities, he had found waiting lists. “A simple lifestyle, but being able to have work: I ain’t got to have nothing exquisite” “Minimum-wage jobs, fast-food restaurants, Wal-Mart, anything like that, a lot of them has already been took,” he says in an Appalachian drawl, explaining that the backlog just to interview was as long as a year. “There are no jobs.” Moore’s story paints an extreme picture of how an economic environment can create a vicious circle of joblessness. While he is an imperfect job candidate, his flaws were molded by his upbringing in Martin County, Ky. and neighboring Mingo County, W. Va. Moore takes advice from Therese Carew, a nun and counselor. Photographer: Photographer Name/Bloomberg His problems started in earnest in 2014. He had been living on his own for several years, having moved out at 18 after dropping out of high school, obtaining his GED, and going to work in security at a coal company. Moore is gay in an intensely conservative region, and he said he left school because of bullying. Moore lost his job in late 2013 after smoking marijuana and failing a drug test. Though he found temporary work as a remote customer service representative, he lost that one when his mother died of a drug overdose in 2014 and he had to plan her funeral. Deeply depressed and unemployed, he moved into an old Airstream camper propped on cinder blocks behind his father’s house, at the entrance to the litter-strewn trailer park that the older man owns in the misty hills of Lovely. There, surrounded by long-unemployed neighbors and rampant drug use, Moore began to abuse his medical prescriptions. “I guess I used it as my crutch, in a way,” he says. Moore began getting in fights while drugged and was arrested twice. When he landed in jail for several months, he realized things needed to change. He graduated from a rehabilitation program in September, one year, one month, and 15 days after that last altercation. Since then, he’s deepened his friendship with Sister Therese Carew, a Catholic nun who ministers to the region, and dedicated his time to job seeking. Opportunities are few. Coal mines have been closing, and they’ve taken most other businesses with them. To employers outside the area, the fact that Moore is neatly groomed, soft-spoken, and polite can’t mask his history. What’s more, he’s the first to admit that the math skills he learned in the local public schools—where only eight in 10 students graduate—aren’t up to par, and his speaking patterns are colored by regional grammar. His situation is difficult, but Moore has found a reason to hope. Coal work, once a mainstay, has become scarce in Appalachia. Photographer: Photographer Name/Bloomberg He didn’t get the job for which he made that 240-mile (386-kilometer) drive, but he dropped in to his old rehab center on the way home. When he explained his predicament, the director of operations told him that he could come back until he gets on his feet. The group has found a job for him in plastics manufacturing that could turn full-time after a 30-day probation period. The position is enabling him to pay $100 a week in rent. It’s a chance to build an employment record as he fights to have his record expunged. Still, moving out requires a tough tradeoff: Moore would have preferred to stay close to home, because his family is still in Kentucky and his father is in his seventies. And the job probably isn’t a pathway to wealth and ease. But what Moore wants most is mere self-sufficiency. “A simple lifestyle, but being able to have work: I ain’t got to have nothing exquisite,” he says. David Wolf wears his journey through drugs and crime on his arm. Photographer: Photographer Name/Bloomberg Branded as Untouchable by a Felony Rap By Patricia Laya Tweet These days, David Wolf doesn’t allow himself to get excited by the news of a job offer. Most get rescinded within days. It’s happened at least a hundred times, he said. In 2012, Wolf was convicted of faking a name and Social Security number to get prescription painkillers. Now the 40-year-old father of three and former Marine, who has an associate’s degree from St. Petersburg College, has struggled to find employment. He's received so many retracted offers that he’s lost count. “I get more interviews that I can shake my stick at, but again, it always comes back around to the denominator of being a felon,” Wolf says from his small, one-level ranch house in a Tampa, Fla., suburb, where religious imagery and family photos decorate his walls. “For many, many years, I pretty much got whatever job I wanted. I was able to do anything I felt like doing. It’s really been a humbling experience.” Wolf researches employment options at a career center in New Port Richey, Fla. Photographer: Photographer Name/Bloomberg Wolf, whose chaotic life before he got clean included several domestic battery and drug-related charges, is one of the more than a half-million people who are released from U.S. federal and state prison every year. The influx occurs as the nation comes out of a decades-long war on illegal drugs. Implementation of stricter laws and tougher enforcement that led to a mushrooming of incarcerations and a booming ex-offender population. Before his identity theft conviction five years ago, Wolf held several jobs in sales and marketing, managed a call center, and served as a recruiter for the U.S. Marines. Since, he and his family have since lived off food stamps and cash assistance. “They wouldn’t even hire me to sell Christmas trees at a Home Depot through an employment agency,” he says. “A lot of times the hiring managers feel like they have their hands tied, due to company policy. It’s something that really needs to change. Not only can I not get a job, but I can’t get a job with a living wage for my family. I have three children. I have a wife. I’m not a bad guy.” Wolf shares his home with his second wife, his toddler, and a cat he gently picks up every time it scurries into the living room. Nearly half of U.S. children now have at least one parent with a criminal record. A Corinthians verse, “Love is patient, love is kind, love never fails,” decorates a sofa cushion. Outside his living room window, children gather by a school bus stop as the morning fog lifts in the modest neighborhood of Holiday, Fla. Less than a 10-minute drive away, he spends his free time volunteering at a Mormon church, where he also gets career training. A workshop book, The Lord Would Want You to Be Successful, rests on his living-room’s desk. Men with criminal records now account for about 34 percent of nonworking men aged from 25 and 54 years old, otherwise known as prime working age. Family photographs on the piano at Wolf’s home in Holiday, Fla. Photographer: Photographer Name/Bloomberg “Myself and many other felons, and we’re facing demons, downtime isn’t a good thing,” he says. Almost half of released inmates are arrested again within eight years, either for new offenses or for violating the conditions of their release. “We’re getting food stamps and cash assistance. We don’t like being on it. But the society that looks down on those receiving assistance is the same society that won’t hire me, and the same society that judges criminals when they reoffend.” He had the word “forgiven” inked on his forearm after a stint in rehab. On the worst days of his addiction, which started following a car crash more than a decade ago, Wolf remembers taking as many as 40 pills in one day. OxyContin, Percocet, and Vicodin were his usual ones. “It affected me, seeing guys that have sentences of 20, 30 years. This is a vicious, vicious circle, and we’re not going anywhere.” Leroy Moore, one of almost 9 million Americans who receive disability insurance, spends nearly half of his monthly check on his apartment. Photographer: Photographer Name/Bloomberg Stymied by Disability, Finding Solace in Art By Patricia Laya Tweet The walls of Leroy Moore’s cluttered apartment in Berkeley, Calif., shake with beats of dissent. Moore, 48, sits at his usual spot in front of the computer on a rainy winter morning, his fingers tapping his cane as he gets lost in a new song by an old favorite, We The People, by A Tribe Called Quest. The hip-hop lyrics speak of discrimination. “Being black, you have to work twice as hard, but being black with a disability, that’s another game entirely,” says Moore, who grew up with cerebral palsy in the suburbs of Hartford, Conn. “I got tiring of hearing I had to prove myself, or that people would have to take a chance on me.” “These were so many jobs I knew I was qualified for, like working with disabled youth, and I still didn’t get them.” Moore is just one of almost 9 million Americans who receive disability insurance, a cohort vastly expanded over the past decades by an aging generation of baby boomers, broader eligibility criteria, and intermittent economic downturns. His disability is a neurological disorder that primarily affects his body and muscle coordination and slurs his speech. Moore studied political science at Southern Connecticut State University. After a couple of back-of-the-shop jobs in college, as a dishwasher and stock clerk, he began a long career in volunteering at centers for the disabled. After moving to the Bay Area in the 1990s, he worked at nonprofits helping people with disabilities lead independent lives. He also began facing his first roadblocks while looking for jobs. “In one interview, I remember the guy just started to talk to me really slowly. I just went along with it and by the end I told him, ‘You should try speech lessons. They worked for me,’” he says. “He turned bright red and I didn’t get the job.” Moore uses his tricycle to cart groceries and take out the recycling. Photographer: Photographer Name/Bloomberg “These were so many jobs I knew I was qualified for, like working with disabled youth, and I still didn’t get them.” Moore started freelancing for magazines, making radio appearances and taking speaking gigs at colleges to make ends meet. His rent-controlled apartment comes to almost $300 a month, wiping out almost half his monthly disability check of around $700. He founded what he calls Krip-Hop Nation, a movement that seeks to unite artists with disabilities and whose work and posters now cover his walls. His favorite records, such as the Cripples’ What’s in a Name and books like Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation, lie on the floor and against the walls. A figurine of Ray Charles sits atop a television, and a bright blue tricycle he uses to get around town sits in the middle of the living room. “The hardest part is people’s attitudes—there’s an invisibility surrounding people with disabilities,” he says. “I used to go to the basement and look at my dad’s records when I was a child. That’s where I first saw disabled musicians, especially in blues. It was my mirror.” Jeff Pfeifer, chief executive officer of MLP Steel, faces a labor shortage. Many prospective workers are disqualified by urine tests. Photographer: Photographer Name/Bloomberg A Drug Epidemic Makes Steel Workers Scarce By Jeanna Smialek Tweet At a 200-foot-long steel-rolling machine in Scottdale, Pa., two workers in yellow hard hats monitor screens filled with flashing numbers as they refine rough wire into pencil-thick rod calibrated to a thousandth of a millimeter. This work takes years of training, and MLP Steel Chief Executive Officer Jeff Pfeifer struggles to find employees to fill the job. Years ago, he spoke on local radio news about the shortage of skilled workers, bringing a line of 100 job seekers to his gravel parking lot. “Two-thirds of people who came in to interview failed the drug test,” Pfeifer says, shaking his head. The company had to pay to test the applicants, so “it got to be a very expensive radio show.” MLP’s business model is built around delivering custom cold-drawn steel, deformed wire and other steel products faster than foreign competitors possibly could. That means workers need to be on top of their game or they dent thin margins and cost precious time. “We’re not out there with shovels and coal anymore,” Pfeifer says. “We’ll just about hire anybody that we can get our hands on if the person comes in drug-free and they show up for work on time.” The complicated jobs, which pay $12 to $20 an hour, plus health care and benefits, require sober workers. Sitting in his office behind a wide wooden desk strewn with manila folders and steel samples, Pfeifer explains that his company has a zero tolerance policy: If you’re using drugs, you’re out. “They present a safety problem to everyone,” Pfeifer said. “We need people in here who are good, they’re alert.” Like much of the Rust Belt, western Pennsylvania is combating an opioid epidemic that’s devolved from painkiller abuse to rampant heroin addiction. “With booze, we could tell it right away; with heroin and whatnot, you can’t,” Pfeifer says. On the factory floor, a spool of steel wire will be custom-shaped under pressure. Photographer: Photographer Name/Bloomberg To maintain a sober workplace, MLP pre-screens job candidates and tests workers’ responses in the event of an accident, Pfeifer says. That’s a regular industry practice, and it’s common for candidates to fall short: A Pennsylvania Manufacturers’ Association study from 2014 found that one in three potential hires either refuses or fails the drug test. “We’re down to a core group of workers right now,” Pfeifer says. The labor shortage comes primarily because older steel workers are retiring and younger generations attach a stigma to steel, he thinks, but drugs are exacerbating the shortfall. Pfeifer’s company is managing its labor shortage by substituting machines for workers. He walked me through one of the motor grease-scented blue warehouses in Scottdale, gesturing toward a computerized panel on the plant’s newer mill and explaining that it stands in for a human worker. It monitors steel as it passes through rollers and dips in and out of water-filled cooling tanks, communicating with a central, manned station down the line. Eventually he’s going to need a specialist to maintain even this machine. And the hiring problem rears its head anew. Mike Schlager offers help and résumé skills training to others who are looking for employment at the Buffalo Employment and Training Center. Photographer: Photographer Name/Bloomberg At 55, a ‘Rainy Day’ Turns Into a Year By Jeanna Smialek Tweet Mike Schlager has gotten plenty of practice at job interviews over the past 15 months. The 55-year-old from Buffalo lost his job as a lumber-company information systems manager a year ago. He was the highest-paid person in his department when it underwent a management change, so the dismissal didn’t come as a complete surprise. In fact, he’d started looking into new jobs months before he was axed. Still, he was unprepared for what came next: more than a year of fruitless running on the hiring treadmill. Schlager estimates that he’s applied to 70 or 80 positions. A dozen companies called him back repeatedly. Whenever management or the human-resources department realizes he’s in his 50s, the offer disappears. “The first thing they say is, ‘Boy, you have a strong resume. We’d love to talk to you,’” says Schlager, who lives alone and has a grown daughter. “Then they bring you in for a one-on-one interview and they see that you aren’t 25, that you’re an older person.” By Schlager’s reckoning, employers probably don’t want to hire someone who will be a health-care expense and who might retire soon, even though he has 37 years of experience. The idea that age discrimination is a barrier to hiring is supported by economic research, and it could be increasingly important as more and more Americans cross the older-than-55 threshold. “It’s a common theme,” Schlager says. “I talk to other people in my neighborhood around my age, and this happens all the time.” Schlager has worked at big-name companies, including FedEx Corp., and his résumé is filled with programming, hardware, and operating-system skills. He says the fact that he gets so far into the interviewing process proves that his abilities aren’t the problem. Anita Wolniewicz, program director at Support Services Corporation, discusses Mike’s employment situation. Photographer: Photographer Name/Bloomberg “It’s very discriminatory, if you ask me,” Schlager said, explaining that interviewers avoid asking his age or mentioning it, because such discrimination is illegal. He has nothing on his resume that marks his age. “It’s a vicious game, and they do it legally, but there’s that undertow.” Schlager was making $53 an hour working 35 to 40 hours a week in his last position, but he’s applying to lower-skill, lower-pay positions in logistics as he broadens his job search. There’s a limit as to how far down the ladder he’ll drop, though, because he wants to make sure that he has employer-provided health-care coverage. Not finding employment isn’t an option. While he has relatively low living expenses, Schlager is dipping into his 401(k), so he’ll need to replace what he’s withdrawn. And, beyond financial motivation, he wants a job for its own sake. “It just kills me to sit here, and not work, and have the abilities that I do,” he said. “I call it a rainy day that turned into a rainy month that turned into a rainy year.” Editors: Stephen Merelman & Brendan Murray Project Managers: Thomas Houston & Emily Engelman Photo Editor: Eugene Reznik Design & Development: Tiffany Hale Terms of Service Trademarks Privacy Policy ©2017 Bloomberg L.P.

Morgan, 48, suffered a broken leg, broken ribs and severe head injuries following a crash involving his tour bus and a Wal-Mart truck in June 2014, leaving him in a coma for two weeks. “I bought my wife a house, it’s $20 million dollars … When we move in we’re going to have another baby. She promised me we can go for a boy as soon as we’re in our new house, so we’re starting tonight,” the funnyman revealed to Ellen DeGeneres in an episode airing Tuesday. Tracy Morgan and wife Megan Wollover; Blac Chyna and Rob KardashianWireImage / FilmMagic “You gotta understand, for a whole year, I was on the couch, I couldn’t do nothin’, so when everything was working, I went crazy,” he explained. “Our sex life is so hot, it’s, like, volatile. We role-play, that’s how we keep it hot. Like tonight, she’s gonna dress up like Blac Chyna and I’m gonna put on a fat suit and be Rob Kardashian. Gotta keep it hot.” Morgan also opened up about two other important figures in his life besides his wife, Megan Wollover. “Maybe a week and half after I came out [of the coma], Eddie Murphy — I spoke to him on the phone, and he made me laugh,” he said. “But I was heavily sedated … I chuckled, I laughed. When I got to give him his Mark Twain Award, I told him from the stage, ‘You’s the first one to make me laugh when I came back, and I love you for that.'” The biggest inspiration for his recovery, however, is his 3-year-old daughter, Maven. “I missed her first birthday because I was in a coma, but I got to see her take her first steps, and that inspired me and my wife to walk for the first time,” the “30 Rock” star said. “I got out my wheelchair — my wife went crazy because my femur was still in little pieces, but she inspired me to get up and walk. I know my purpose in life now is to spread love.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under blac chyna ,  ellen degeneres ,  rob kardashian ,  tracy morgan Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Katy Perry added to list of Grammy performers Read Next Katy Perry added to list of Grammy performers Most Popular This Week 1 Kate Upton throws diva fit over Sports Illustrated cover 2 Surprise!

(WPRI) — Police in Coventry are looking for a man they believe stole a BB gun from a big box store early Tuesday morning, then tried to hold up a woman with it. Officers said a woman called them to the Walmart on Centre of New England Boulevard about 5:30 a.m., saying after she parked to go into the store, a man in a red Ford Ranger pickup truck approached her, pointed a silver handgun at her, and ordered her to give up her purse. She refused, and continued walking into the store. The man then drove off, in an unknown direction. After investigation, police determined the man had already been inside the Walmart, and shoplifted the gun — a BB gun pistol — from the sporting goods department less than an hour before. Officers determined the man and his truck had been captured on surveillance video.

(Mark Wilson/Getty Images) Washington ranks as the fourth-best place to live among big U.S. metropolitan areas, according to a new report. U.S. News & World Report on Tuesday put out its list “2017 Best Places to Live” in the country. It ranks 100 large-scale metropolitan areas, considering factors such as quality of life, job prospects and affordability. The top three slots went to Austin, which bumped Denver into second place; and San Jose, which came in third. Fayetteville, Ark., which is about 30 miles from Bentonville, the home of Walmart, was fifth. Kim Castro, executive editor at U.S. News, said in a statement that among the top things people consider when moving are the following: finding a job in their field, getting involved in their community, good schools for their kids and making enough money to buy a home (in no particular order). [From 2015: D.C. ranks No. 6 on list of the nation’s sweatiest cities] Castro said the ranking of the best places to live “takes all of that into account — the metro areas that do well are the ones with strong job markets and high quality of life.” For the D.C. area, the report says the experience as a resident varies depending on their neighborhood. The report said “each neighborhood in the District and its surrounding towns has its own atmosphere. “Residents gather for block parties, mingle at dog parks and converse at coffee shops, creating an ambiance similar to that of a much smaller community.” D.C. ranks as the nation’s fourth-best place to live among 100 big metro areas ranked by U.S. News & World Report. (Ron Edmonds/AP) The study gave the D.C. region a score of 7.3 out of 10. And it said the average monthly rent is $1,498 and the average annual salary is $65,910. [D.C.’s Metro is the No. 1 transit system in the nation. Yes, you read that right.] The report also highlights the D.C. area’s transit system for being extensive and its supply of restaurants and entertainment and cultural spots. A few other upsides to the D.C. region, the report said, include that the region’s “surrounding communities are clean, and there are plenty of public parks.” Some of the data and factors for the ranking come from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the FBI, according to U.S. News & World Report. The top 10 list also included: 6. Seattle 7. Raleigh/Durham, N.C. 8. Boston 9. Des Moines 10.

Two German grocery store chains, Aldi and Lidl, are taking the market by storm and making food shopping even cheaper. They are already having an impact on the U.K. grocery industry. Sales at Walmart's (WMT) U.K. unit, Asda, have fallen 1.9%, as competitors such as Aldi and Lidl eat into its market share. What is the story with these two companies? Both Aldi and Lidl are based in Germany and are among the world's largest privately owned companies. Founded in 1913 by brothers Karl and Theo Albrecht, Aldi was later was split into two parts, Aldi Nord and Aldi Süd. Aldi Nord is the owner of Trader Joe's. Lidl, founded in 1930 by Dieter Schwarz, has nearly 20,000 stores in over 25 countries. While the company has not yet cracked America, Lidl is expected to open stores in 2018, focusing on the East Coast between Pennsylvania and Georgia.

(WLFI) — Lafayette police are looking for an 80-year-old convicted child molester after U.S. Immigration decided not to deport him in October. News 18 looked into why the man was allowed back into the community and found out it’s a problem more common than one may think. “It’s mortifying to think about that,” Tippecanoe County resident Teresa Barker said. In March 2015, Teodoro Macias was arrested after witnesses saw him molesting a 10-year-old in a van outside of the Wal-Mart on Veterans Memorial Parkway in Lafayette. “If he’s willing to do that in public like that, who knows what he’s been doing when he’s not in public,” said Barker. Macias wasn’t supposed to be allowed back into the public, but U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement decided not to deport him in October – citing his advanced age and medical circumstances. “It should make absolutely no difference what age he is. The crime is the crime, regardless what age or condition,” Barker said. Tippecanoe County Prosecutor Patrick Harrington has now filed a new charge against Macias for not registering as a sex offender. Harrington can’t talk about this case specifically, due to the pending charge, but he was able to talk about a general communication problem with ICE. “The frustration is with the system not the officers that work with this,” Harrington said. “Federal law doesn’t allow them to share certain information with us.” “Sometimes they do remove them from the local jail and take them to a federal system for a hearing on the deportation, and then we are never advised what happened to them,” Harrington continued. “Were they actually removed from the country or were they released?” If it weren’t for this new charge against Macias, police wouldn’t even be looking to arrest him. “I actually have a young daughter and it’s repulsive to me that he managed to not be deported, not be put behind bars, and there’s a possibility that he’s still in this community,” said Barker. News 18 plans to follow up on this story by contacting local congressmen to see what can be done to stop this from happening in the future. If you have any information about where Macias could be located, you are urged to call the Lafayette Police Department at 765-807-1200 immediately.

Around AOTF × All News Reviews Opinion Videos Guides Rumors Platforms Xbox One PlayStation 4 PC Games Nintendo Switch Mobile Games More Contact Us Write at AOTF Ethics Privacy Attack of the Fanboy News PS4 Glacier White Out Now in The US Exclusively Through Walmart Share Tweet by Jose Belmonte on February 7, 2017 Sony has released the new Glacier White model of PlayStation 4 in the United States, but contrary to the launch planned in Europe and Asia, the new version will only be available through Walmart, and it comes bundled with Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare for $299. This Glacier White model consists on a white PlayStation 4 Slim with a 500Gb HDD, paired with a white Dual Shock 4 controller. There have been no announcements concerning a PS4 Pro version, although fans have asked for it through comments and social media. While the console itself is identical to the European and Asian release, there are some interesting differences that may be related to the conditions of each market. For example, the US bundle includes a high profile game for $299, while most European retailers have that same price in Euros only for the console. On the other hand, the international release is not limited to only one retailer. Infinite Warfare is the futuristic new iteration of the multi-million franchise from Activision and Infinity Ward, and it comes with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered in the same disc. The last update for Infinite Warfare included new missions within the Mission Team system and a Leaderboard for the game. Combat records and an emblem editor will be coming in February’s update. Sony recently announced that PlayStation 4 had smashed the distribution record for their consoles in a fiscal year quarter, needless to say all variations of the console are doing well for the company.

Courtesy of United States Secret Service i By Ron Gallagher rgallagher@newsobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story FUQUAY-VARINA Days after Raleigh and Wake Forest police arrested men they said had counterfeit money, Fuquay-Varina police Tuesday posted a Facebook notice warning local businesses that there have been numerous reports of counterfeit $20, $50 and $100 bills turning up. Monday, Raleigh police served a state prison inmate with charges that he had used five counterfeit $100s to buy an iPhone in November when he was on parole. Saturday, Wake Forest police charged two men with having 86 bogus $20s and said one had bought items at a Walmart store and the other tried to pass currency at a Dollar General store. “We are currently investigating several cases involving counterfeit bills being disseminated at local grocery stores, drug stores and big box stores,” the Facebook post said. It urged business owners and managers to “be vigilant in verifying large denominations of currency at your business.” Police posted a link to the U.S. Secret Service’s web page with tips for spotting bogus currency. In the Raleigh case, Terryon Lamont McEachin, 27, was charged with one count of obtaining property by false pretense and one count of having five or more counterfeit bills. Police listed a Durham address in an arrest warrant for McEachin, but he was booked with a Fayetteville address. Police had obtained the warrant for McEachin on Dec. 29. He was brought to Raleigh on Monday from a state prison where he was admitted Jan. 4 for violating parole. He had been convicted in Durham in March 2014 of felony restraint of a minor. The charges against McEachin said he had given a woman five $100 bills to buy an iPhone 6+, but that they all had the same serial number and were counterfeit. An agent with the U.S. Secret Service field office in Raleigh said the three cases did not appear to represent an influx of counterfeit money to the area. The Triangle’s access to Interstates 40, 85 and 95 means that people with forged money sometimes stop in the area on their way to and from metropolitan areas in the Southeast and Northeast, the agent said.

Justin Joffe for Observer Joe Steinhardt is not special, he tells me in The Knitting Factory’s green room on a cold February Friday. And the label he’s built up to shine a light on his hometown scene in New Brunswick, N.J., Don Giovanni Records is not special either. But to the 60-plus artists who’ve released records through Don Giovanni that span punk, hip-hop and comedy, this label is changing the game. Since founding Don Giovanni in 2003 with his best friend, Zach Gajewski, Steinhardt has transformed the label into a full-time commitment, all while managing to get his doctorate in Communication along the way. Of greatest interest to Steinhardt are the narratives surrounding the music he loves—what story is this artist telling, and what life circumstances inform their work? As such, Don Giovanni’s roster is refreshingly diverse, inclusive, and tough to codify, standing wholly outside the culture industry at large. Steinhardt first hit me up last fall and invited me to Don Giovanni’s New Alternative Music Festival in Asbury Park. Refreshingly devoid of sponsors, “branded experiences” and all the other dreck that music fans are used to dealing with at these things, the festival put DIY values into action. It even had a mission statement: There is an alternative to music released and distributed by three multi-national corporations. There is an alternative to music festivals as branded experience for millennial males. There is an alternative to music steeped in sexism, racism and homophobia. There is an alternative to corporately managed bands. There is an alternative to music as a commodity. There is an alternative to corporately run music festivals. Now we’re meeting at The Knit as bands file in for the second night of Don Giovanni’s latest showcase. During the prior night’s performances, it fast became clear that Steinhardt didn’t need to be there to tell anyone’s stories for them. Nerdcore rapper Sammus told the crowd about growing up upstate as one of the only black kids in her school, and some shitty classmate who didn’t even try to understand her feelings of otherness. In refreshingly transparent banter, Mal Blum told the crowd of their struggles with anxiety, exacerbated through relating to someone who tries to control you. “What’s the first thing that fascist regimes actually do? They start censoring culture.”—Joe Steinhardt Steinhardt and I discussed why you can’t dismantle a system from the inside, why being truly independent means more than being on a smaller imprint of a major label, and why putting Don Giovanni’s artists onstage is a form of resistance no charitable donation can match. We talked about the week’s announcement that one of Don Giovanni’s biggest acts, Downtown Boys, had signed with indie giant Sub Pop Records. And we arrived at the conclusion that artists need to own their own stories again, their own work, their own art. “When some future human or alien race digs this up, what are they really gonna find?” Steinhardt asked. “Our art, our culture. They’re not gonna find out how much money Goldman Sachs made in a year, they’re not gonna care about anything besides what we create.” Joe Steinhardt: I appreciate you doing [this]. I think they all can’t make enough money. Publications are closing, getting bought. The best music writers I know are writing about food, or something where there’s more jobs. There’s a lot more collusion in music journalism, and arts journalism in general, because it’s entertainment—more branded content, more photo ops. I’m sure this is something you’ve at least brushed up against. Oh yeah. Do you consider yourself a curator of your hometown scene? No, I think of myself more as a documentarian than a curator, if that makes sense? A curator has taste, and is selecting things that fit that taste. I’m more shining a flashlight, or a spotlight and a camera, documenting what’s happening in a scene rather than trying to form a scene. So I think he’s doing a great job trying to form a scene, if that’s his goal. My goal is to let things happen and think of it more as documenting. I hate the word “curate.” It’s so bougie. It’s not the bouginess of it. Someone was telling me they were curating a festival, and to me, here’s the problem with curation—it’s the antithesis of what punk and DIY is about, which is that anyone can do it, that anyone can do anything. So anyone can do what I do, anyone can grab a camera and take a picture, anyone can write an article. And curation implies that there’s some expertise that you have over other people. I remember when that word first came about, maybe six or seven years ago— —Outside of galleries you mean? Outside of art galleries, “this show was curated by” takes away the fact that a show can be booked by anyone. Now you need a curator. “Anyone can do anything, and not just that, everyone can do everything. No one’s fucking special.” My trouble with the word notwithstanding, I’m starting to put together shows, just as a fan, and I’m trying a way to codify what I’m doing. You book shows! [Laughs] I book shows, I booked the show tonight. I don’t think I really curated it; the show curated itself. You know what I’m saying? Anyone can make a fanzine, anyone…the point about what what I do is that anyone can do what I do, there’s nothing special about me or Don Giovanni, it’s just that I’m doing it tonight and you’ll be doing it tomorrow. That’s just where I came out of in New Jersey, at some point that vanished from punk and I think that’s a really important notion. Anyone can do anything, and not just that, everyone can do everything. No one’s fucking special. Well that’s a stigma about creative people—when people ask you what you do at a party, it’s never plural. And it’s hard for people to wrap their heads around someone who exists in multiple contexts. That’s the trouble with longform too. It’s hard to present complex connections to people. And that’s why I like longform. I think it’s your best shot at presenting something deeper than just “here’s what’s out there tonight.” And so I do everything, everyone I know does everything. You’re a doctor of communication? Yeah, the stuff I study is pretty esoteric. I look at risk and health communication. And that’s why you’ve said there’s no tangible through, that you separate the two worlds? Yeah, there’s not a good thread. Izzy True @ Don Giovanni’s showcase on 2/2/17. Justin Joffe for Observer Something that’s been coming up a lot in my conversations lately is this idea of accelerationism and hypernormalization, as they relate to media consumption and the 24-hour news cycle. Do you think there are conscious efforts afoot by capitalist, monied interests, be they conservative or liberal, to facilitate that? Yeah, because you’ve gotta make money for somebody else now. We’re seeing a tightening. The top’s always been tight—people were complaining in the ‘80s, the ‘70s that the media was too consolidated. But we’re seeing even more consolidation at the top, that’s maybe switched from media companies to tech companies. That’s the shift we’re seeing now, from the big three media companies to the big three tech companies that have even more dominance—Google, Apple. They’re compiling media now, too. AT&T bought Time Warner, right? Yep, and it’s all merging. As a result of the ownerships, the media is just slurry to them, and they’re just throwing it out there. They don’t care if I’m consuming a piece that you’ve spent a week researching and writing or if I’m consuming a photo of a topless celebrity on the beach. They don’t care because they own both that topless photo and you. And they own everything in the middle. I’m thinking about writing a book over the next few years, and that’s something I’m going to have to grapple with as a freelancer. If I want to pull from any of these great conversations I’ve had over the last few years— Who owns them? Not I! That’s the point, and that’s what you’re seeing. But that’s why independent labels are more important than ever, and that’s why independent values are worth fighting for. To be honest, I have a bleak view of the future for independent music. I’m not sure if it’ll be a thing in five, 10 years. Without the resources to do the ratfuckery that they do, sending out press materials and orchestrating campaigns, you have to step up your game in turn. It’s not even that. I can compete on a physical level. It’s the digital shit. And they’ve always controlled certain infrastructures—they control radio, they control end caps at big retail stores, they controlled pricing at Walmart when that was a real thing that mattered. An independent song’s never made it to top 40 radio. Maybe it’s on an independent label that’s then partnered with Sony to get it on radio and Sony gets a bit of that. That’s what distribution means, when we hear that a major label is helping distribute? Yeah, to radio or to stores. We have a distributor that’s independent of Sony, but Sony has an independent arm that’s Orwellian—an independent arm owned by a major label. They think that’s real. By their definition of independent music, artists like Taylor Swift are quite literally independent, because she sits on this label called Big Machine, which is all this work with major labels. “Who owns those models? Who owns these new ideas? I don’t want any multinational corporations controlling the entire culture industry.”  It’s a semantic co-opting of the word and the ideals and the ethics. And at the level of Taylor Swift it’s just good business. She gets a better deal with the Big Machine. So there’s reasons for it, but that idea of independent has nothing to do with Dischord or Lookout! or us. That’s why I rush to the word curator I guess. Because you’re someone who’s brought a lot of emerging bands to that next step, to that next audience waiting to hear them. And you’ve done so gratefully without any of the classic drama we’d see on VH1 of the old manager suing for royalties or any of that shit. I think there’s a selflessness involved here that operates wholly outside of that infrastructure, and then the challenge just becomes, how do you not stay cynical. You don’t stay cynical because there’s still a real fight to be had. And we’ll lose that fight—independent film kind of had that fight in the ‘80s and lost. There’s really no such thing as independent film anymore. They tried to have films distributed outside of the major motion picture companies and they lost that fight. Music’s kind of wrestling with that right now. [But] there’s still a chance, and that’s why I’m not cynical. Well we’re seeing these new models for distribution emerge now I guess. Yeah, but who owns those models? Who owns these new ideas? All you’re really doing is shifting sometimes from Sony to Apple. There’s no difference to me between Sony and Apple. Major labels’ powers are minimized, but now we’ve maximized Apple and Google and Amazon’s powers. I don’t want any multinational corporations controlling the entire culture industry. We’ve seen some of these new models just shift the power from music companies to tech companies. [Laughs] They haven’t figured out how to solve some of the things that true independent or DIY infrastructures do really well. The grassroots label throwing a secret show, the reality of playing a last-minute secret show at a small venue when the band is in town. There are some things that you have to be present with people or just frequent a space or live in a neighborhood to get. Right, and on that level, that is why these “independent” labels that are basically majors have a role, because they can react to things faster, deal with less higher ups. And if I’m a pop artist, yeah, I don’t want to deal with those people either, I want a middleman. But I’m trying to fight all of that shit with what I’m doing. Let’s come back to this idea of you seeing yourself as a documentarian, because it’s a really interesting frame for looking at  the music you release. Had I never met you before, and only based my assumptions of the wizard behind the curtain on the bands that he books, I’d take you for some pockmarked California liberal waving a wooden picket signs. You know my point. You take a lot of risks, well not risks, because it’s all great music, but you go out of your way to include people who are perhaps aesthetically or culturally outside your own demographic and your own history. And that’s the benefits of an all-ages space, too, I guess. It’s for the queer kids, the kids who might not be old enough to get into a real venue where they can vanish into the dark and dance for a few hours. If I never got into this before I was 18, I never would’ve gotten into this. That’s an important point. You were at this event at Rutgers a while back and it made me wonder, what’s the pulse like between the label and the college community? They recently opened a music archive, archiving the New Brunswick scene, maybe that’s what you’re talking about? Yes. Marissa Paternoster of Screaming Females at 4 Knots Fest ’15. Justin Joffe for Observer Well it actually opened this year, but two years ago they were announcing that, and that’s when they had me and Marissa [from Screaming Females] and Jim and Ronin come and do a panel. Jim’s been doing this Jersey zine called Jersey Beat my whole life, maybe doing it for 30 years, and Ronin wrote a book about New Brunswick and was in a very political band I used to listen to a lot in high school. Jersey Beat broke shit like The Feelies and Yo La Tengo. Do the hallowed Jersey indie bands have any notable contemporaries from New Brunswick? Well the big New Brunswick band was The Smithereens, but I never really got into them. New Brunswick’s always kind of had its own thing. It’s definitely got a college-town feel, but you could be in the bigger city and not see any signs of college there. What passions inflamed during this talk? I heard Marissa said something about how Rutgers didn’t support art. Oh yeah, well that was the thing—we were at Rutgers doing this panel on the New Brunswick music scene, and Marissa and I wanted to make it clear that one of the biggest threats to the scene was Rutgers. We brought that up on the panel. Just as an expansive business and landmass, eating resources and properties? Yeah, but to a bigger extent there’s an arts community in New Brunswick that the school could be fostering or putting money into. Who has the most space in New Brunswick for legal performances? Rutgers has a million fucking rooms. And they’re not taking advantage of them. Not only not taking advantage of them, going out of their way to not let that kind of stuff happen. So that’s what we brought up. There are all these spaces that we could be booking shows in. Maybe you just need a student committee to advocate for it. No, we’ve had that happen. That’s the thing—the school could have this and make this a thing that keeps happening, but they make it very difficult to book anyone. “So when a band leaves, on the outside it looks like a success, but on the inside, I ask myself, where’s the failure? It’s good for business, but I’m not talking about business. I want to know, what happened?” Politics? Probably. That’s one of the reasons I’ve been getting more involved with the city there. We’ve been doing these outdoor shows working with the city, trying to win some minor little influence with the city and say “you should put more resources into this.” They’ll give us a bit of money, but it’s not real money, and we’re seeing how that goes. We’re trying to build a better relationship with the city to show that the arts community is really important there, and maybe they’ll nurture it. We do a free show every summer, [Chris] Gethard hosts it, Screaming Females plays, Downtown Boys, and it’s big—we get hundreds of people there. Congratulations to Downtown Boys, by the way. They had a big week. Yup…I wish they were still doing it with us, but you can’t fault them there or anything. You’re like a mother whose kids are constantly going off to college. Are you wistful about it? It’s not so much wistful, and it’s not a success or a failure. It’s more that I have to look at it like, “Am I not able to provide enough without the label infrastructure of Sub Pop, and if not, why can’t I provide that?” So you have to look at that critically every time [this] happens, and figure it out. As a label you make more money passing off your bands, because now somebody else is spending the money to promote them instead of me. But that’s never been the goal of the label. The goal has always been to keep the bands here. So when a band leaves, on the outside it looks like a success, but on the inside, I ask myself, where’s the failure? It’s good for business, but I’m not talking about business. I want to know, what happened? I forced myself to grow over the years to serve my bands, and I do a lot of things I really don’t wanna do. When it seems like they’re really violating my personal ethics and values about music I won’t do ‘em, but some things are things I’ll do that I just happen to think are stupid. Like we go to SXSW now and do a showcase there, and I think that’s fuckin’ stupid. But when we go there, it’s on our terms. There’s no sponsors, it’s all ages, etc. And I deal with Spotify now. They’re one of the most vile companies, but our bands want to be on there. I’ve offered, “Do you want to get off Spotify?” “No.” “Then I’ll schmooze with them and try to get you on these dumb fuckin’ playlists.” I’m here to serve the bands because if I don’t, then they have no choice but to leave for labels like Sub Pop. So I’m proud that at least with Downtown Boys, they had a choice—us or Sub Pop. It’s not like they had no choice. And I don’t think I failed with them. Because I can’t fault them for trying out something different, but I’m proud to be able to say, “You can do all this stuff with or without Sub Pop.” We’ve had bands play Coachella, we’ve had bands that were on MTV and license songs to video games and films. You can do that stuff with us, or you can do that stuff without us, but I don’t want bands to be able to say, “I can’t do that stuff on Don Giovanni Records.” Those are very tangible benchmarks of ascension, but I think on a very simple and basic human level, too, you’re there for them. What was that band last night after Big Eyes? Mal Blum and The Blums. You got the singer a beer! That’s what it comes down to. And this is obviously someone who’s very talented and can totally fucking rip, who’s very transparent about the shit they’re working on in their own life with that banter. Fostering a sense of community that intimate for someone with so much talent who’s finding out how to be themselves in a creative ecosystem is important. Well I was kind of drunk last night and saying, “this is important, this is power.” Why am I doing this when I don’t take money from this? I think culture is the most important thing, that’s why I studied communications. What’s the first thing that fascist regimes actually do? They start censoring culture. They don’t build prison camps first, they start censoring books. Why did they burn Helen Keller’s book in Nazi Germany? Because if you see that someone like that can write a work that beautiful, all of a sudden you can’t put them in a camp. Mal Blum & the Blums shreds @ Don Giovanni’s showcase on 2/2/17. Justin Joffe for Observer Why is Trump fighting with SNL? Because culture’s important, arts are important. That’s why Rex Tillerson got on Twitter a week or two ago and said that he actually supports the National Endowment of the Arts. We’re America’s greatest export. Oh yeah, and that’s why this stuff is so important. You’re giving this person a platform to say this kind of stuff, that’s a big deal. People usually don’t get platforms to say this kind of stuff. They’re usually sitting in the audience or at home. And that’s also why this control of keeping it outside the establishment is important. How can we let our artists have this voice without having them join Sony? Or be someone like Beyoncé, who is protesting through the establishment? The establishment’s controlling that, they’re getting all the money from it. With every dollar she spends protesting, they might get three dollars against it. That’s what the trippy BBC doc Hypernormalisation suggests. That even these channels of art and culture we think we’re absorbing from a countercultural lens or a subversive means have this monied interest driving them and putting the work out there, that the things we think are feeding our own heads are really part of someone else’s narrative. And you can make your own narrative when you completely withdraw from it, can’t you? We’ve seen how narrative has been hijacked over the last several months. And that’s what I was getting into at school, I studied the importance of narratives. I think about narratives a lot, how we tell stories and how that influences reality and politics. That’s why it’s important to keep cultural narratives in the hands of the purveyors, not the corporations. A lot of really important art comes out of major corporations, but what have they done with that power? They’ve worked to destroy artists. I imagine you don’t care much for the word “content” either. I never thought about it, but I don’t write. You know what I mean, though. That’s what happens when you take the story away from the storyteller and turn it into something ubiquitous. I really enjoy having these conversations. I do too, and that’s what I’m saying—that’s why I go out of my way, much to my own detriment, to not take money from the label to really separate finance and the label. The label has a lot of money, but by being able to put it back into the label and have it so I could just spend it all on records I’m never gonna sell again if I want to, I knew that freedom to truly be able to separate the cultural interests from the financial interests. And that’s the thing that people usually find totally insane, but people have been telling me I’m insane about this for 15 years. So maybe I’m insane, but it’s working. “Operating outside the mainstream though, right now and always—under Obama, under Bush, under Clinton—that’s the most important act of resistance for a business in a capitalist system. Putting the artists that we do onstage instead of ones that might sell more and represent less is resistance.” Well when everything is inherently political these days, when things are politically stigmatized that weren’t six months ago, you could argue that blending the culture and the finances is the best weapon against that. It’s so cliche, but I think money is the root of all evil. I’m thinking about The SCUM Manifesto, when Valerie Solanas was talking about destroying all the banks and destroying money. She goes into destroying men, too, and I’m O.K. with that in the context of her thing. But a lot of it’s about destroying money, and I’m older now [to] where I believe in that in a more mature way than I used to. Like throwing shit through windows. This is the thing—I still think it’s worth throwing shit through windows. The Black Bloc, dude, they punched Richard Spencer in the face. But there’s also something to be said for working inside an infrastructure that you don’t respect to slowly dismantle it from within, or reform it. It’s funny, I had this discussion with a friend of mine who works at Sony just two days ago, she was there last night and she’s probably gonna come tonight. I was actually arguing the opposite—I don’t know if you’re ever gonna dismantle stuff from within. I don’t know if it’s ever happened before. Everyone’s got this plan, “I’m gonna get into mainstream politics, run for Senate, change everything. I’m gonna become a lawyer and restructure it.” No, no. If you wanna destroy law, you have to operate outside the law, make it work, and then show a new model that works outside the law. That’s what Kafka said. And Bob Dylan. Well Bob Dylan’s a genius, but he definitely operates inside the system. Although they did find him walking around on his own looking at random houses. I remember that, that made me really happy when that happened. That was in Jersey, too, wasn’t it? I think I really get him. Big Eyes @ Don Giovanni’s showcase on 2/2/17. Justin Joffe Are there any conscious attempts to use your adjunct infrastructure and grassroots channels to feed the resistance around the current administration’s policies and practices? Oh yeah. The resistance is primarily through perseverance and continuing to do what we’re doing though. Of course at some base level we’ll be doing some fundraising, but I think that’s the smallest thing. What’s the least you can do? The least you can do is give money to important causes. Operating outside the mainstream though, right now and always—under Obama, under Bush, under Clinton—that’s the most important act of resistance for a business in a capitalist system. Putting the artists that we do onstage instead of ones that might sell more and represent less is resistance. [We talk for a bit about the editing process, and Joe explains how his academic life has trained him to be great at turning things around quickly and his writer brain scrutinizes his own words to tell him how something he said could be explained better.] So in many ways, with regard to the self-discipline of routine and mitigating schedules, the academic tract has really served your label operations. They’re also similar in this broad sense. It fits my personality in that being a research professor, I can produce whatever I want to produce as long as it’s enough to keep afloat in this weird way. I get to pick my own research problems and find out how to pay for them, just like with the label. If only we could get grants for musicians. I don’t even think we’ll be able to get any grants for science foundation research in the future. I remember when that second Think About Life record came out with a little scrawl on the back saying “This record was created with the assistance of the Canadian government” or something similar. Yeah, Canada does a lot of that, which is great. The government should be supporting the arts 100 percent. It doesn’t necessarily mean it should be supporting our arts, but the government should be supporting all artists’ lifestyles. Education, healthcare…there are things the government can do to make it so you have artists, because you need artists. That’s all it is man. When some future human or alien race digs this up, what are they really gonna find? Our art, our culture. They’re not gonna find out how much money Goldman Sachs made in a year, they’re not gonna care about anything besides what we create. What do the next six months look like for you? First we do the La Neve tape, Joey from Downtown Boys, so we still work together on stuff. That’s 2/24. 3/24 is Kissing Is a Crime’s debut album. 4/4 is Aye Nako’s new album. And this could change because of art issues, but it’s supposed to be 6/1 and it might be 6/15 or later, Lee Bains’ new record. How do you keep yourself open to new sounds outside of your comfort zone? I’ve never thought about it. You like who you like. Yeah, and that’s what I’m saying about narratives in culture—I’m really drawn to that stuff. If you look at the records at my house, you might not be able to tell what I like to listen to until I talk to you about them. Some of its free jazz and improvisation, I have a lot of that stuff. I have a lot of outsider private press stuff, a lot of mainstream music too, and punk, indie, whatever—but there are threads that go through all of it related to the people making it, the time and place. Outsiders are always big to me—does it come from inside a system or outside of a system? So you’re really interested in all the context that informs the work. You like to look at through different lenses. Yeah, narrative’s what it is. Why is that Shaggs record so good? The story around it. And why do some people say it’s so bad? Yeah. I listen to a lot of early blues, folk, and jazz, when people were making their own instruments and making up their own rules. I listen to a lot of field recordings, just people trying to express themselves literally however they could. But I also listen to a lot of polished stuff too. Singer-songwriter type stuff. Like Iris DeMent, one of my favorite singer-songwriters. But she still operates pretty outside of the system at this point. She runs her own record label and puts out music on a timescale that has to do with culture, not marketing. Bill Fay always struck me as someone like that, he’s on his own trip. Bill Fay’s great, yeah. So stuff like that. Gillian Welch is amazing—her and Dave Rawlings control, release and master all their own shit. And so there are these sort of narratives that draw me to music more than sound I guess. Is this the future of how we reclaim our own work? If there’s this consistent pattern across the media industry of the creative class being at the bottom this totem pole, the expandable bottom, is this what we’re gonna have to do to curb that? Only if there’s not people fighting to operate outside that system. People need options. And whether it’s someone like Gillian Welch, the type of stuff we do, or your local hardcore scene, there need to be people fighting for who owns the culture and not just what it sounds like. Who controls the narratives. Who profits. To me that’s what matters, that’s what’s important. I don’t think there’s such a thing as a record that sounds better than another, objectively or scientifically. Why do you really like the records you like? Either it’s been marketed to you with a narrative, or you made up your own.

Patriots quarterback Tom Brady after winning Super Bowl LI as seen in the Fox Sports VR app. Image: fox sports VR By Adario Strange2017-02-07 16:24:57 UTC Opinion A funny thing happened on the way to my futuristic dive into the Super Bowl in virtual reality — it never happened.  Yes, I have my own, fancy Oculus Rift set up along with a pricey high-spec computer to help me immerse myself in the virtual waters of everything from gaming to animation and, I thought, sports events. SEE ALSO: Facebook's VR social network is surprisingly stunning But it turns out that Fox Sports, in its mainstream content wisdom, decided to offer its VR presentation of the Super Bowl exclusively on the Samsung Gear VR version of the Oculus store, and not the Oculus store for the Oculus Rift.  I know I speak for my Rift brethren out there when I say, WTF?  Focusing on the wrong users At first I thought maybe this had something to do with the mobile VR app Fox Sports developed being perhaps too lightweight and not high-resolution enough for the high-end environment provided by the Rift, but nothing could be further from the truth.  Not only is the Fox Sports VR Super Bowl presentation insanely well-designed, the app, its interface and its array of video and data offerings look about as good as any non-gaming content I've seen on the Rift.  The virtual VIP box framing the Fox Sports Super Bowl LI VR experience. Image: fox sports vr Now, a couple of days later, after I've plumbed the depths of the app, I'm here to say that there's simply no excuse for this amazingly well done, immersive sports experience to not be available to people who have paid upwards of $2,000 to equip themselves with the best available VR.  Yes, we know that there are far more people who own mobile VR headsets like the Gear VR, Cardboard and now Google's Daydream View. Mobile VR is great, but at this point, focusing on it over high-end VR headset users is like walking into Walmart and passing out Hamilton fliers — you'll get a few bites, but you're not reaching people who know and care about the Broadway musical. One of the many interactive game stats screens available in the Fox Sports Super Bowl LI VR experience. Image: Fox Sports vr Denying passionate VR lovers access to a huge VR event like the Super Bowl doesn't make any sense: Oculus users don't necessarily own or even want a low-end headset, plus they may or may not be on Android (the only phones that work with Gear VR or Daydream View). So the result is VR's most loyal users are cut out of the biggest thing happening in the medium. Who thought that was as good idea? Similarly, the premiere of 24: Legacy, which aired on the same network just after the Super Bowl, also had an incredibly well produced VR experience ("The Raid"). Yep. You guessed it. It's only available on the Gear VR.  A scene from 24 Legacy 'The Raid' on the Samsung Gear VR. Image: Samsung VR So, just to make sure you're keeping up, here's what VR users were presented with on Sunday: 1. The Fox Sports VR app is available on Oculus store for Gear VR, but not the Oculus store for Oculus Rift.  2. The 24 Legacy "The Raid" app is only available on Samsung VR app, but to get "that" app you must first download the mobile Oculus app. And no, you can't get any version of "The Raid" app on the Oculus store for the Oculus Rift.  Did you catch that? It's almost like a riddle. (In which the answer is: Do I actually care this much?) Not. Confusing. At. All.  And while this might seem like a one-off event, I've encountered this time and again over the past year when it comes to VR experiences. It seems in their rush to capitalize on the still mostly uncooked world of mobile VR, many major VR productions are simply bypassing high-end VR headset owners (including the Rift, HTC Vive and PlayStation VR) altogether.  Case in point: The NBA's VR production partner, NextVR, remains solely focused (for now) on mobile VR like the Gear VR and Google Daydream, instead of serving the needs of the most dedicated consumers who have invested the most in this emerging technology.  Who's to blame? "It's ultimately up to the developer in terms of what platforms they are building for, whether that be on Rift or Gear VR," an Oculus spokesperson said, after I asked about the uneven distribution of certain apps and experiences between the Gear VR and the Rift. "Often times, there are developers who choose to bring their apps to Gear VR first as it’s the more accessible option for a wider variety of people who may not be invested in the higher-end VR experience yet. Mobile is still the best entry into VR for a person who may not want a full PC setup just yet given it’s still a new technology." VR is still a fledgling technology that needs to lean on the users who support it the most fervently. That approach might make sense if your strategy is simply focused on capturing the most eyeballs possible by any means necessary, but VR is still a fledgling technology that needs to lean on the users who support it the most fervently. Instead, major VR productions are treating the medium as though it's just another app.  But it's not. VR is different.  Whether the experience is sports, gaming or social, VR demands more engagement from the user than any other software experience, and that experience has to be delivered in just the right way, with high quality, or you'll lose an otherwise enthusiastic future VR user.   The small team at Viacom NEXT (a VR-focused team within the broadcast giant) appears to understand this dynamic. Recently, I had the opportunity to experience the team's immersive music video "Chocolate," directed by Tyler Hurd, which premiered at Sundance in January. Rather than pumping the incredibly well-produced VR music video to as many people as possible on mobile VR platforms, the team is focusing (for now) on delivering it to the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive in the coming months. A scene from the VR music video "Chocolate." Image: viacom next "It's a shortsighted decision to prioritize mobile VR," says Rob Ruffler, senior director at Viacom NEXT. "I think it's shortsighted because it's prioritizing the wrong things. The priority today in VR should not be, 'How many people can I get to view this thing, but how good is the experience for the people that do view it." If major VR studios are wondering why more people aren't already singing the praises of VR, I present to them at least one major clue: You guys are making things unnecessarily complicated by muddying the distribution waters and focusing on VR tourists (aka non-sticky mobile users) over dedicated, high-end VR users.  If you want to make mainstream VR successful, holster your greed and focus less on becoming the dominant platform early in the game and spend more time on making it easy to experience incredible VR content.  The new lesson of VR is an old one: content is (still) king…but only if you can find it.   BONUS: This VR paint studio allows you to collaborate live with anyone in the world Topics: 24: legacy, fox sports, fox sports vr, Gear VR, NBA, nextvr, Oculus, samsung gear vr, Super Bowl, Tech, virtual reality, VR About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

By Toby Gooley Comment FIRST THE GOOD NEWS: U.S. holiday retail sales in 2016 were up more than 4 percent over sales during the same period in 2015. Now the bad news: That didn't seem to help retailers much. In December and January, several major chains announced or carried out layoffs and store closings, including Macy's, JC Penney, CVS, and The Limited (the last of which recently closed all of its mall stores). This comes on top of the 2016 demise of Sports Authority and store closing announcements by Sears, Kmart, Ralph Lauren, Office Depot, and others. Even Walmart is closing hundreds of stores. The economic, technological, and societal forces that have converged to create this industrywide upheaval are many and complex. Online shopping, changing consumer preferences, the explosive growth in the number of e-commerce competitors, the cost and operational challenges of omnichannel operations ... those are just a few of the factors affecting retailers' ability to survive and remain profitable. Some of the responsibility for minimizing or counteracting the resulting damage falls on the shoulders of supply chain managers. That is likely why respondents to the Retail Industry Leaders Association's (RILA) 7th annual "State of the Retail Supply Chain" survey said controlling supply chain costs would be their top strategic priority in 2017. The difference from year to year is striking. In 2016, "enhance customer service" was the top strategic priority, cited by 30 percent of respondents as their primary concern. This year, just 8 percent said that would be their primary focus in 2017. Instead, 42 percent of respondents said controlling supply chain costs would be their main strategic priority, up from 28 percent last year. Supporting revenue growth was second, with 31 percent (up from 22 percent in 2016), while balancing cost and service was third, at 19 percent, the same as last year. For the latest survey, professors Brian Gibson, Rafay Ishfaq, and Cliff Defee of Auburn University's Harbert College of Business polled RILA's members, DC Velocity's readers, and retailers that collaborate with the Auburn, Ala., university's Center for Supply Chain Innovation. To round out the picture, the research team conducted telephone interviews with retail supply chain executives. The study's final results will be released at RILA's 2017 Retail Supply Chain Conference in Orlando, Fla., in mid-February, but the preliminary findings discussed in this article provide useful insight into how retailers are managing their supply chains in an increasingly omnichannel world. THREE HOT TOPICS The survey's 60 or so respondents represent U.S. retailers of all sizes, with projected 2017 revenues ranging from below $1 billion to more than $10 billion. They are also well qualified to speak about supply chain strategy: About 33 percent hold director or vice president positions, and 50 percent classified themselves as managers. Respondents have 20 years of supply chain management experience on average. Each year, the study zeroes in on three "hot topics." This year, those topics were cross-channel integration, analytics, and cost control and recovery. All three are critically important at a time when retailers must be able to track, manage, and deploy inventory across an enterprise, regardless of location or sales channel, while responding to&mdashand often anticipating&mdashcustomers' preferences. Those mandates no doubt inform respondents' plans for supply chain-related investments in 2017. Compared with 2016 spending levels, 43 percent plan to increase their investments in supply chain process improvements, 37 percent plan to expand their omnichannel fulfillment capabilities, and 36 percent said they plan to upgrade their supply chain technology and software. Here are some highlights from the preliminary survey results as well as a sampling of the researchers' comments on those findings: Cross-channel integration. The survey asked about supply chain integration in the context of omnichannel retail. Just over a third of respondents said they are pursuing integration of online and store fulfillment activities, while 16 percent said they had already achieved that goal. Not everyone believes such integration is necessary, though: 24 percent said they would continue to keep online and store fulfillment separate. As for the degree of cross-channel integration achieved to date, respondents counted themselves most successful when it came to order fulfillment, with 50 percent saying they've already achieved complete integration and 39 percent saying they have partially integrated that function. One-third said they have completely integrated order management systems, inventory allocation, and order delivery across channels. It's telling that 44 percent currently have no cross-channel integration in returns processing, a costly and complex activity that's proving to be a thorn in retailers' sides. Why so much variation? "When people respond, they are drawing upon their area of expertise and how they see integration in their own functional areas," observes Ishfaq, an assistant professor and research fellow in supply chain management at the school. "Somebody on the warehousing side will have a different perspective than someone on the merchandise side." Respondents have ambitious goals for the future. When asked what level of integration they expect to achieve three years from now, 50 percent or more said they would achieve complete integration in demand planning, order management systems, inventory allocation, and order fulfillment. Interestingly, 60 percent said the same for returns management, signaling that this area will be getting a lot more attention than it has in the past. (See Exhibit 1 for a "now" and "three years from now" comparison.) None of that will be easy to achieve, cautions Gibson, who is a professor of supply chain management at Auburn and the study's leader. He calls the level of integration required for effective omnichannel operations "mind-boggling." The detailed work of implementation and obtaining visibility over inventory across channels is challenging, and groups that traditionally did not communicate much, such as supply chain and merchandising or store operations, must now collaborate very closely, he explains. Furthermore, retailers' approach to incentives and rewards can discourage decision-makers from taking a hit for the team, that is, taking on additional costs that may make their function's performance look subpar but will benefit the overall organization. Still, he adds, "the level of omnichannel integration compared to where we were when we first started the survey has vastly improved." Analytics. Respondents clearly see value in supply chain analytics, ranking "improving forecast accuracy" and "retaining current customers and sales" as the top benefits of developing such capabilities. Next on their list was "capture new customers and sales." It's notable that customer- and sales-related benefits ranked higher than such obviously supply chain-related benefits as optimizing inventory investments and improving order fill rates. That may reflect the influence of lessons learned from last year's strategic focus on customer service. Very few respondents consider their organizations to have advanced capabilities when it comes to the use of the four types of supply chain analytics: predictive (which are designed to project what will happen in the future), prescriptive (to establish forward-looking strategies and capabilities), descriptive (to evaluate current conditions), and diagnostic (to understand why results occurred). The majority said they have either "basic" or "intermediate" capability, while in each of the four categories, a little more than one-fourth said they have no capability at all. The areas where respondents currently make the most extensive use of analytics are inventory planning and allocation, and customer needs analysis. Only 18 percent said they use analytics extensively in their returns operations, an area many retailers are struggling to manage. Respondents were on the same page when it came to their assessment of what it takes to develop analytics capabilities. Ninety percent either agreed or strongly agreed that having an enterprisewide strategy is critical to success. Similarly, 86 percent agreed that effectively managing the volume and complexity of supply chain data is a major success factor, and 80 percent said the same about sharing data and analysis with supply chain partners. Three other high-ranking factors highlighted the human side of analytics: investing in analytics tools and talent (86 percent), executives understanding the benefits and limitations of analytics (85 percent), and hiring individuals with both supply chain and analytics expertise (80 percent). The human factor should not be underestimated. "Almost everybody we spoke to said they have a big issue with finding the right talent," Ishfaq says. "It's one thing to purchase software, but you need people to work the data you collect into actionable information. This is one of the underlying challenges that is a temporary impedance to the extensive use of business analytics across the supply chain." Cost control and recovery. Currently, 50 percent of respondents partially recover the costs of providing omnichannel fulfillment and delivery services, and another 40 percent of respondents recover none of those costs. Ten percent do not even measure omnichannel cost recovery. In fact, only 40 percent of respondents believe it's even possible to fully recover those costs—something no respondent has yet achieved. Furthermore, 95 percent of respondents said they expect the cost of their supply chain operations to increase in the near future, which could push the cost-recovery goal further out of reach. In a bid to at least partially recover costs, many respondents are imposing service fees or plan to do so in the future. For example, two-thirds currently charge for expedited service, and one-third impose delivery fees for small orders. Other types of fees are far less popular, and 50 percent or more said they have no plans to collect fees for in-store fulfillment, returns shipments and processing, or small orders. (Some respondents may have selected "no intention to use" because the scenario does not apply to their business.) Respondents were also asked to name the three most effective ways they could "monetize" or control retail supply chain costs. At the top of their weighted list was leveraging a single inventory pool across all channels, followed by encouraging customers to buy online and pick up orders in stores, having vendors directly fulfill orders, and charging delivery fees for all orders. But there are significant barriers to implementing cost-control steps, including an inability to measure and allocate costs, the variety of fulfillment options offered to customers, and competitors' willingness to absorb supply chain costs. At least 60 percent of respondents considered each of the situations cited to be either moderate or major barriers to controlling omnichannel costs. (See Exhibit 2.) Nevertheless, Gibson sees reason for optimism. Retailers are gaining a great deal of confidence in using analytics, and most understand the value of cross-channel integration, he says. But most supply chain organizations, he says, will struggle with omnichannel's biggest question: "How do we offset rising costs and make sure that as we take on additional supply chain costs, we're also driving revenue and profits? If you can answer that, you'll be in good shape," Gibson says. "If you can't answer that question, then you're going to be the next Limited or Sports Authority."

Penney Had a Rough January All three department store chains reported disappointing holiday sales results, raising questions about the industry going forward. Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Feb 7, 2017 at 10:21AM What happened Shares of department store chains Macy's (NYSE:M), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), and J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP) tumbled in January, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, dropping 16.2%, 20%, and 20.2%, respectively. All three companies reported lackluster holiday sales results, featuring comparable-sales declines across the board and slashed profit guidance at Macy's and Kohl's. So what The department store industry has been in a funk for years, with total revenue slumping considerably over the past decade. Discounters like Wal-Mart, wholesale clubs like Costco, and online retailers like Amazon.com have all been taking their toll. The department store model of generating gross margin in the mid-30s and advertising heavily to drive store traffic is in genuine peril. Image source: Macy's. The holiday season has become an all-out promotional slugfest to attract foot traffic, and the department stores are losing the battle. Macy's reported a 2.1% decline in comparable sales during November and December, with weakness in handbags and watches hurting its results. The company pointed to changing consumer behavior as having a major impact on sales, and while its e-commerce business grew at a double-digit rate, it's not yet big enough to offset the poor performance of its stores. Macy's slashed its guidance for 2016 due to its poor performance during the holidays. The company now expects comparable sales to slump by around 3%, the low end of its previous guidance range. Adjusted EPS, previously expected between $3.15 and $3.40, is now expected to come in between $2.95 and $3.10. The same story played out at Kohl's. Despite efforts to manage inventory and avoid profit-killing markdowns, Kohl's holiday season was its worst in years. Comparable sales in November and December slumped 2.1%, down from a 0.4% increase during the same period in 2015. The company saw volatile sales throughout the holiday season, with weakness sandwiched between a strong Black Friday and week before Christmas. Kohl's also slashed its full-year guidance in response to its disappointing performance. Adjusted EPS is now expected to come in between $3.60 and $3.65, down from a previous guidance range of $3.80 to $4.00. Gross margin will be lower than anticipated due to the mix and timing of sales and a competitive promotional environment. J.C. Penney's results look best on the surface, but the company's sales are still so depressed that anything short of growth is a disaster. Comparable sales fell 0.8% during November and December for J.C. Penney, a number that would have been viewed as borderline-positive for either Macy's or Kohl's. But J.C. Penney is still unprofitable as is works to slowly recover from the steep sales decline it suffered in 2012, so declining holiday sales are a major problem. J.C. Penney still expects to produce EBITDA of around $1 billion during 2016, and it predicts to continue its recent streak of producing positive operating profit. But interest on its excessive debt load will erase that profit and then some. Now what Action is already being taken in response to the weak holiday results. Macy's announced on Jan. 4 that it plans to close 68 stores by mid-2017, with another 30 expected to be closed over the next few years. The company is also restructuring its operations, with plans to eliminate layers of management, cut non-payroll costs, and reduce its field infrastructure. As part of this effort, 6,200 jobs are expected to be eliminated. Macy's has also been selling some of its real estate, and that effort could intensify going forward as the company looks to unlock value. Rumors of a potential takeover bid from Hudson Bay, the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue, surfaced in February, pushing up the stock as a result. This erased a portion of January's drop, but the stock remains down considerably. J.C. Penney also plans to close some stores, although a concrete strategy hasn't been announced. While most J.C. Penney locations are now profitable, according to CEO Marvin Ellison, sales remain stubbornly low. Kohl's hasn't announced much of anything as a response to its poor holiday season, but store closings in 2017 wouldn't be a surprise. The number of department store locations is set to decline going forward as the industry struggles to compete. Macy's and Kohl's are both possible buyout candidates, with plenty of cash flow generation despite sluggish sales. J.C. Penney has a tougher challenge ahead, with the company still losing money and unable to keep its previous streak of sales growth alive. With the department store industry in turmoil, January's slump in the stock prices of these three companies may be just the beginning. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned.

(Photo Provided/Tippecanoe County Sheriff's Office) TIPPECANOE COUNTY, Ind. (WLFI) — Police are asking for your help finding Teodoro Macias, 80, after prosecutors said he failed to register as a sex offender. In March 2015, Lafayette police were called to the Wal-Mart on Veterans Memorial Parkway on Lafayette’s south side. A witness told police they saw Macias molesting an underage child inside a van in the store’s parking lot. They later found out the child was only 10 years old. Officers said Macias admitted he knew his actions were wrong. In October 2016, Macias was sentenced to two years and 38 days. But he already had 576 days of jail credit. He was supposed to be deported but was not. Therefore, Macias has been free in the Greater Lafayette community since his sentencing. When News 18 asked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement why Macias was not deported, ICE responded: “On March 6, 2015, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) placed a detainer with the Tippecanoe County (Indiana) Jail on Teodoro Macias-Zamora, an 80-year-old Mexican national, following his arrest on local criminal charges. However, upon further review of his case, ICE exercised prosecutorial discretion due to Macias-Zamora’s advanced age and medical circumstances. ICE considers the merits and factors of each case, and routinely exercises prosecutorial discretion for health or other personal reasons.” Macias now faces a Level 6 felony charge of information of failure to register as a sex or violent offender. Anyone with information about Macias’ whereabouts is asked to contact the Lafayette Police Department at 765-807-1200 or use the anonymous WeTip Hotline at 800-78-CRIME.

Mike Groene’s “true colors” came out in a World-Herald article Sunday that focused on an exchange of emails the North Platte senator had with a public school defender two years ago. In the emails, Groene described teachers as “lazy” and “second rate.” Groene is unapologetic, saying the comments were taken out of context and were aimed at bad teachers. “If this is the type of leadership that we’ve got serving our state, and heading our Education Committee in Lincoln ... it just shows his ignorance toward what the real issues are,” Pate said. “And if he thinks he has all the answers, he’s wrong.” In the emails, Groene wrote that teachers keep their jobs only because of tenure, which protects teachers from being fired without just cause. “Ever since the cowardly draft dodgers of the sixties hid behind education deferments and infested our public education system, our public schools have weakened,” Groene wrote. Citizens need to reclaim education, he added, and if teachers don’t like it, “Walmart is hiring.” Groene has said that schools waste money on administrators and frills, and that parents, not teachers or special interests, should control education. Groene, contacted Monday night, said, “It’s a free country. He can say what he wants. And if he ever wants to come to Lincoln, I’ll visit with him.” Pate described himself as very fiscally conservative, “but I would never, ever make statements like this.” “I am truly very, very afraid of what is going to happen in Lincoln under Sen. Groene’s leadership as the education chair,” Pate said. “And I may be saying things that I shouldn’t be saying, but it’s got to be said.” The education chair holds significant influence over education bills and funding. Pate said he couldn’t sit idly by and allow him to make comments like that. Pate said he worries that public education will continue to be under attack this legislative session. “He is a dangerous person, and we need to make sure he sets the record straight,” Pate said. Millard board President Mike Kennedy said he wished Groene knew about the Millard Education Association’s willingness to work with the board. “I’m tired of people lumping groups together — for example, going after our unions. Some unions sometimes don’t do the right thing, but I’ll tell you what, there’s been no better partner for this board,” Kennedy said. “When we’ve had tight times, we’ve sat down at the bargaining table and worked well with them. And they have conceded some major points in order for us to keep cuts away from the classroom.” Kennedy said the district’s administrators are professionals who care about their profession and have advanced degrees. He suggested that if Groene wants to know about education, he should come talk to the Millard staff. He said the Millard board is one of the most conservative boards in the state. “Why are you attacking education as a whole?” Kennedy said. “We are the third from the bottom in the state on per-pupil spending. We have one of the leanest teacher-to-administrator ratios. I challenge him to find better. And we get results.” joe.dejka@owh.com, 402-444-1077 +1  Mike Groene RYAN SODERLIN/THE WORLD-HERALD +1  Mike Pate More information Fiscal conservative, proponent of school budget cuts leads Nebraska Legislature's Education Committee State Sen. Mike Groene, a 61-year-old salesman of agricultural equipment from North Platte, got his start as a critic of spending by his local school district. In 2006 he led a statewide petition drive to limit government spending that was opposed by the state’s teachers union, the Nebraska State Education Association, among others.

and trip to nation's capital Finalists also named in Huntertown, Sullivan, Angola, Boonville, Indianapolis and Granger News provided by Prudential Insurance Feb 07, 2017, 09:07 ET Share this article INDIANAPOLIS, Feb. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Grace Zhang, 18, of Carmel and Tara Harmon, 14, of Zionsville today were named Indiana's top two youth volunteers of 2017 by The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards, a nationwide program honoring young people for outstanding acts of volunteerism. As State Honorees, Grace and Tara each will receive $1,000, an engraved silver medallion and an all-expense-paid trip in early May to Washington, D.C., where they will join the top two honorees from each of the other states and the District of Columbia for four days of national recognition events. During the trip, 10 students will be named America's top youth volunteers of 2017. The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards, now in its 22nd year, is conducted by Prudential Financial in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP). Continue Reading The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards logo (PRNewsFoto/Prudential Insurance) These are Indiana's top youth volunteers of 2017: High School State Honoree: Grace Zhang Nominated by Carmel High School in Carmel Grace, a senior at Carmel High School, organized a one-day "street store" in Indianapolis last year that enabled more than 200 struggling families to obtain free, gently-used clothing. A couple of winters ago, Grace watched as a homeless man tripped on his baggy pants and fell to the sidewalk. "No one helped him," she said. "I watched as his dog licked the tears off his face." That sad image stuck with Grace and prompted her to begin researching organizations that help the poor. She came across Street Store, an international project started in South Africa to give the homeless and people in need a dignified shopping experience. After obtaining instructions and materials from the organization, Grace went to work. She enlisted the help of fellow students in her high school club, contacted local organizations that serve the poor, solicited clothing donations at schools and in the community, and lined up sponsors. The week before her event, Grace was devastated to learn that her beloved grandfather in China was dying. She had a choice: cancel the Street Store or risk never seeing him again. "I knew my grandfather wouldn't have wanted his illness to impede on charity for the homeless," she said. So she proceeded to set up her store, and welcomed needy shoppers to choose from among 16,000 articles of donated clothing. Sadly, Grace's grandfather died without hearing about her successful event. "But I saw my grandfather in every shopper," she said.  Middle Level State Honoree: Tara Harmon Nominated by Zionsville Community Schools in Whitestown Tara, an eighth-grader at Zionsville West Middle School, secured $4,000 in grants and donations over the past three years to provide weekend meals, healthy snacks and school uniforms for inner-city kids in her community. While walking around downtown Indianapolis with her family, Tara frequently encountered homeless people, and it broke her heart. But after seeing a homeless mother and son sleeping on the street, "I went home and thought long and hard," she said. With encouragement from her parents, Tara began researching ways to help. Through an online search, Tara identified an elementary school with a high rate of free and reduced-price lunches, and while visiting the school, learned about its desperate need for uniforms. She then sought a grant from the Indianapolis Colts and a donation from Walmart; the result was 200 new uniforms for the school. Tara also learned that without subsidized lunches at school, many students go hungry over the summer. She responded by securing another grant and more store donations, and used the money to provide 100 weekend meal packages to summer campers. To encourage healthy eating, Tara also planted a vegetable garden that yielded 600 pounds of produce for an inner-city summer camp. Tara estimates more than 500 kids in need have benefited from her activities. Distinguished Finalists The program judges also recognized six other Indiana students as Distinguished Finalists for their impressive community service activities. Each will receive an engraved bronze medallion. These are Indiana's Distinguished Finalists for 2017: Katherine Dorsey, 17, of Huntertown, Ind., a senior at Carroll High School, has given out more than 8,500 books to children in need, working with a number of community organizations to share the pleasure of reading with kids who may not have books of their own. Katherine collects books by visiting garage sales with her mom and asking for leftover books, and she further supported her efforts by securing a $500 grant and partnering with a half-price bookstore. Emily Greggs, 18, of Sullivan, Ind., a senior at Sullivan High School, organized "Run For Those Who Can't," a 5K run that raised $2,800 for the ALS Foundation and a scholarship named for her late uncle, who was diagnosed with ALS her freshman year. An active community volunteer, Emily has also co-chaired a high-heeled race for men that raised $2,000 for the Sullivan County Community Kitchen, and worked with her HOBY group to organize activities for children in need. Elayna Hasty, 15, of Angola, Ind., a freshman at Angola High School, leads "Girls Against Bullying (G.A.B.) Girls," a program she started at 9 years old to help its young participants feel strong and confident. Elayna, whose best friend was bullied so badly that she became home-schooled, was moved to develop a program with three main workshops: "Princess Within Me" for girls 5-8; "Stand Up and Speak Out" for boys and girls, and "Free to Be Uniquely Me," encouraging girls to stand together. Isabelle Hemenway, 13, of Boonville, Ind., a seventh-grader at Boonville Middle School, has mobilized her community to support several charitable causes through "Just a Girl on a Mission," an effort that's collected 700 books, 100 items for animal shelters and more. After being provided with a flimsy comb during a hospitalization, Isabelle put out a call for hair product donations for young patients, and when she was able to deliver 300 of them to the hospital's pediatric unit, she decided to make her collections a regular event. Rachel Kent, 17, of Indianapolis, Ind., a senior at Cathedral High School, runs a charitable business creating and selling friendship bracelets, and donating 100% of her proceeds to a charity helping people in developing countries and making an identical bracelet for a child served by the charity for every one she sells. Rachel has raised more than $1,000 through her "Knot Your Average Bracelets" shop on Etsy, and provided bracelets to children from India to Uganda. Phillip Yang, 18, of Granger, Ind., a senior at Culver Academies, is the head of the Culver Diversity Council promoting respect and inclusion on campus, and recently spent more than five months organizing a diversity day that brought the school community together for a day of celebration and unity. Phillip collaborated with the club advisor, peers and alumni to coordinate the event, which drew more than 800 students to a multicultural fair, student-facilitated workshops, a concert and more. "Prudential is honored to recognize these young volunteers for their exemplary service," said Prudential Chairman and CEO John Strangfeld. "We hope that their stories inspire others to consider how they, too, can volunteer their time and talents to improve their communities." "These service-minded young people have brought meaningful change to communities at home and abroad, and it's a privilege to celebrate their work," said JoAnn Bartoletti, executive director of NASSP. "Congratulations to an exceptional group of middle level and high school students." About The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards represents the United States' largest youth recognition program based solely on volunteer service. All public and private middle level and high schools in the country, as well as all Girl Scout councils, county 4-H organizations, American Red Cross chapters, YMCAs and HandsOn Network affiliates, were eligible to select a student or member for a local Prudential Spirit of Community Award. These Local Honorees were then reviewed by an independent judging panel, which selected State Honorees and Distinguished Finalists based on criteria including personal initiative, effort, impact and personal growth.  While in Washington, D.C., the 102 State Honorees – one middle level and one high school student from each state and the District of Columbia – will tour the capital's landmarks, meet top youth volunteers from other parts of the world, attend a gala awards ceremony at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, and visit their congressional representatives on Capitol Hill. On May 8, 10 of the State Honorees – five middle level and five high school students – will be named America's top youth volunteers of 2017. These National Honorees will receive additional $5,000 awards, gold medallions, crystal trophies and $5,000 grants from The Prudential Foundation for nonprofit charitable organizations of their choice.    Since the program began in 1995, more than 115,000 young volunteers have been honored at the local, state and national level. The program also is conducted by Prudential subsidiaries in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Ireland, India, China and Brazil. In addition to granting its own awards, The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program also distributes President's Volunteer Service Awards to qualifying Local Honorees.

La., Feb. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Anna Katherine Tollett, 16, of Ruston and Zach Morgan, 12, of Denham Springs today were named Louisiana's top two youth volunteers of 2017 by The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards, a nationwide program honoring young people for outstanding acts of volunteerism. As State Honorees, Anna Katherine and Zach each will receive $1,000, an engraved silver medallion and an all-expense-paid trip in early May to Washington, D.C., where they will join the top two honorees from each of the other states and the District of Columbia for four days of national recognition events. During the trip, 10 students will be named America's top youth volunteers of 2017. The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards, now in its 22nd year, is conducted by Prudential Financial in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP). Continue Reading The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards logo (PRNewsFoto/Prudential Insurance) These are Louisiana's top youth volunteers of 2017: High School State Honoree: Anna Katherine Tollett Nominated by Cedar Creek School in Ruston Anna Katherine, a junior at Cedar Creek School, has worked tirelessly over the past eight years on behalf of kids who, like her, suffer from Type 1 diabetes, raising funds to find a cure, enhancing public awareness of the disease, campaigning for legal rights and protections for diabetic students, and providing support to newly-diagnosed children and their families. "When I was first diagnosed, the daily demands of managing this relentless disease combined with the often-misinformed public perception of diabetes left me feeling overwhelmed and alienated," said Anna Katherine. But "because of the support and guidance of family, friends and community, I became determined to reach out to those living with diabetes, and challenge the public perception of the disease." The day after she left the hospital, Anna Katherine participated in the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's annual fundraising walk, and in subsequent years led a team of her own. With help from her father, she shot a 30-second public service announcement about diabetes, which won the top prize in a national contest and has been seen by more than 16,000 viewers. In 2012, Anna Katherine successfully lobbied her state legislature to make it easier for kids to manage their diabetes at school, and then took part in a lobbying effort in Washington, D.C., that secured millions of dollars for diabetes research. She also helped start a foundation that aids kids and their families immediately following a new diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes. Middle Level State Honoree: Zach Morgan Nominated by Live Oak Middle School in Denham Springs Zach, a sixth-grader at Live Oak Middle School, collected more than 5,000 hats and 2,000 toys for kids with cancer, and secured a grant to fund a week-long summer camp for children with the disease. It all started when Zach saw a TV commercial about childhood cancer. "I felt bad for kids who had cancer," he said. "I felt bad that it changed their childhood. I wanted to make them feel better." Since he already liked to collect baseball caps, Zach decided to begin collecting them for kids who lose their hair to chemotherapy. He received 250 new caps and hats in his first drive at a local Walmart store, and then threw a pizza party at a local children's hospital to hand them out. Subsequent drives have yielded thousands of additional hats, which have gone to kids across the country. "I have learned that even the smallest things – like a baseball cap – can put the biggest smile on a kid," said Zach. He also distributes toys through "Treasure Chests of Courage" that he has placed at several cancer treatment facilities. In addition, Zach has hosted events that have generated more than 1,000 pounds of food for students at local schools who have little to eat on weekends. Distinguished Finalists The program judges also recognized four other Louisiana students as Distinguished Finalists for their impressive community service activities. Each will receive an engraved bronze medallion. These are Louisiana's Distinguished Finalists for 2017: Nelson Gueho, 17, of Livonia, La., a senior at Catholic High School of Pointe Coupee, led a project to establish a food bank at a fire station in his town, an effort that involved constructing an 8x10x9-foot room, holding a food drive to fill it, and now working with his local chief of police to keep it stocked and maintained on an ongoing basis. The pantry Nelson constructed opened just in time to help people in need after a disastrous flood. Miranda Hawthorne, 17, of Woodworth, La., a senior at Holy Savior Menard Central High School, has collected more than 1,000 pounds of recyclables at her school through "Saving the World One Box at a Time," a program she created to combat waste. Moved to act after watching a teacher throw away a stack of PowerPoint printouts because she'd printed the wrong one, Miranda delivered recycling boxes to each classroom; she now gathers their contents and takes them to a local recycling plant on a weekly basis. Elizabeth Hughes, 14, of Coushatta, La., an eighth-grader at Red River Junior High School, has conducted various service activities to support senior citizens in her community including helping to build wheelchair ramps so they can move freely in and out of their homes, and helping out at a local nursing home three times a week over the summer. Elizabeth also works with her grandmother to visit the homes of local senior citizens. Macy Wells, 18, of Loranger, La., a senior at Hammond High Magnet School, joined her local fire department as a junior volunteer in May 2016, and since then has served more than 200 hours helping with water rescues, medical emergencies and traumas, including in the aftermath of a recent disastrous flood. Macy, a student in her school's medical magnet program who aspires to a career in sports medicine, has also volunteered on the sidelines at several games alongside her school's athletic trainer. "Prudential is honored to recognize these young volunteers for their exemplary service," said Prudential Chairman and CEO John Strangfeld. "We hope that their stories inspire others to consider how they, too, can volunteer their time and talents to improve their communities." "These service-minded young people have brought meaningful change to communities at home and abroad, and it's a privilege to celebrate their work," said JoAnn Bartoletti, executive director of NASSP. "Congratulations to an exceptional group of middle level and high school students." About The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards represents the United States' largest youth recognition program based solely on volunteer service. All public and private middle level and high schools in the country, as well as all Girl Scout councils, county 4-H organizations, American Red Cross chapters, YMCAs and HandsOn Network affiliates, were eligible to select a student or member for a local Prudential Spirit of Community Award. These Local Honorees were then reviewed by an independent judging panel, which selected State Honorees and Distinguished Finalists based on criteria including personal initiative, effort, impact and personal growth.  While in Washington, D.C., the 102 State Honorees – one middle level and one high school student from each state and the District of Columbia – will tour the capital's landmarks, meet top youth volunteers from other parts of the world, attend a gala awards ceremony at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, and visit their congressional representatives on Capitol Hill. On May 8, 10 of the State Honorees – five middle level and five high school students – will be named America's top youth volunteers of 2017. These National Honorees will receive additional $5,000 awards, gold medallions, crystal trophies and $5,000 grants from The Prudential Foundation for nonprofit charitable organizations of their choice.    Since the program began in 1995, more than 115,000 young volunteers have been honored at the local, state and national level. The program also is conducted by Prudential subsidiaries in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Ireland, India, China and Brazil. In addition to granting its own awards, The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program also distributes President's Volunteer Service Awards to qualifying Local Honorees.

NorthEscambia.com News for Molino, Bratt, Walnut Hill McDavid, Century & Cantonment     Home News Events Features Blog Sports About Contact Advertise Free Classifieds | Obituaries | Latest Headlines Boyette Dead, Rice In Custody In Georgia Fourth Boyette Victim, A Beulah Mother Of Two, Has Passed Away Prison Inmate From Escambia (AL) County Escapes Triple Murderer’s Name, Social Media Causing Problems For Family, 60-Year Old Business IP Explosion Update: Info Center Cutting Hours Lawmakers Back Unanimous Juries In Death Cases Brick Sale Continues For Century High School Monument Free Sign Language Class Offered At Century Church Northview, Jay Lose In District 3-1A Basketball Tourney Triple Murderer Manhunt Won’t Close Escambia Schools Tuesday Boyette, Rice Still On The Run As Manhunt Continues February 7, 2017 UPDATE from 9 am Santa Rosa press conference: “Sooner or later, he is going to make a mistake, and when he does, we are going to pounce on him,” Santa Rosa County Sheriff Bob Johnson said during a morning press conference, adding that Boyette knows the woods in Beulah “like the back of his hand”.  K-9 units and helicopters are being used in the search. “The ending is up to him…if he decides he wants to come out with a a gun, we’ll put him down if we have to,” Johnson said. The U.S. Marshals area also involved in the manhunt and have called in additional marshals from across the country. No credible information that he is in Santa Rosa County, Johnson said. “He is a very violent and dangerous man,” State Attorney Bill Eddins said, referring to Boyette’s criminal history prior to the murders. Mary Barbara Craig Rice was spotted in a Crestview Walmart on February 2. They have least one gun and have purchased extra ammunition for it. PREVIOUS STORY: Day seven of a massive manhunt continued  Tuesday for  William “Billy” Eugene Boyette Jr., a suspect in three recent murders and Mary Barbara Craig Rice, now considered an accomplice. The Escambia County Sheriff’s Office has doubled the number of uniformed deputies on the streets, and the reward in the case has increased to $21,000. On Monday, Boyette allegedly shot Kayla Crocker during a home invasion robbery on Beulah Road. Her 2-year old in the house was unharmed. The couple stole her 2006 white Chevrolet Cobalt with Florida tag 9613BJ. The vehicle may have right passenger door damage and it has a skull and cross-bone sticker on the back window. Boyette and Rice then made a purchase at a local Shell station and then proceeded to get breakfast at Hardee’s. That vehicle has not been recovered. Rice has dyed her hair orange. Boyette did not exit the vehicle at the Shell or Hardees. “Once again our suspect is mobile,” Sheriff David Morgan said. “We have called in all of our available resources.” Boyette, 44, is a suspect in the shooting death of 30-year old Alicia Greer and 39-year old Jacqueline Moore in Milton at the Emerald Sands Inn on Tuesday and  52-year old Peggy Broz Friday morning in Lillian, AL. Law enforcement officers in multiple counties spent Sunday following up on alleged sightings of Boyette, but all turned out not to be him. He allegedly stole the victim’s car Friday in Lillian. That vehicle was found abandoned in Beulah Saturday morning on Nine Mile Road near the I-10 intersection, not far from Navy Federal. That led authorities to believe that he might  be in Escambia County where he has family ties. A K-9 search around the car turned up nothing. “I want to emphasize to the community that we are looking now, aggressively, for someone who is a killer in our community,” Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan said during a joint news conference Saturday afternoon. “Some are saying, ’sheriff, you’re scaring our community.’ I hope I am. If Mr. Boyette and his family are listening, I intend to aggressively pursue anyone that aids, abets or assists in any way in Mr. Boyette’s continued evasion of law enforcement,”  Morgan said. “We have reason to believe that he’s involved in three homicides to date. For God’s sake, let’s don’t make it four.” “I cannot overemphasize how dangerous this suspect is,” Morgan said. “Do not — I repeat, do not — in any way attempt to contact or have contact with Mr. Boyette. Get on your telephone and notify law enforcement. Citizens are not equipped to deal with this.” Anyone with information on Boyette’s whereabouts should call 911. Authorities said he is considered armed and dangerous and should not be approached. Comments 14 Responses to “Boyette, Rice Still On The Run As Manhunt Continues” Concern citizen on February 7th, 2017 4:30 pm My prayes goes out to each family that has lost love ones. My heart aches right now for all. Especially the young mother who was shot in front of her baby. WOW. I pray that he will stop this madness and turn hisself in. My prayers are also for his family. tiff on February 7th, 2017 4:14 pm Maybe god will strike him dead in this weather…. I pray for that!!! Karen on February 7th, 2017 4:06 pm yeah Beulah is home of meth people go there to live and never be seen it’s a close nit community. I’m with others living in the woods this long is not easy. molino jim on February 7th, 2017 4:06 pm For those who are so quick to come down on law enforcement and the court system please take the time to read why he was not locked away long ago, One victim did not show up for court and could not be found due to having warrants out for her. Others withdraw their complaints and on and on. The system can work if the victim will testify and not change their story. Other wise the court has to let the person go. It’s not a good system — but it’s what we have to live under some times. Steven Downing on February 7th, 2017 3:46 pm In the event these two are getting updates, maybe State Attorney Bill Eddings should offer up a deal to Mary Rice. You find a way to turn yourself in and testify against Billy, we won’t pursue the death penalty against you. That might encourage her to put a bullet in his head and end this fiasco. Steven Downing on February 7th, 2017 3:42 pm Here’s hoping that Billy and Mary are seeking shelter from the weather by hunkering down under the tallest pine tree in the forest…right before the lightning bolt strikes. mike on February 7th, 2017 3:41 pm What if a civilian shot & killed them both? Not a bounty hunter, mind you, just a regular citizen. Would they get the reward or a 2-count murder charge? Just curious. Bushcrafter on February 7th, 2017 2:07 pm It’s not nearly as easy stay hidden and fed in the woods as most people think, especially without plenty of skills or the correct tools. Based on what they are carrying them in the picture, and the rains coming down, I don’t expect them to stay there much longer. Beegee on February 7th, 2017 1:46 pm Please,my Father,let this come to an end…….Amen Bob on February 7th, 2017 1:39 pm Sheriff David Morgan said that he is known to use spice and stay up for 5-6 days no that sounds more like he use’s Meth. Hugh in Beulah on February 7th, 2017 1:31 pm This fool and his orangetang sidekick hasn’t met up with the right person. In yesterday’s trail cam photo > definitely a gun in his left hand. In her left hand it appeared to be a Mag flashlight and gallon of water. In her right hand it appeared to be a 2 way radio (long and slender). Too large for a cell phone and really didn’t look like a handgun. I can believe that his family/friends/drug dealers are keeping these two updated on the whereabouts of law enforcement. I called a neighbor today to speak with them about this news. Can you believe they didn’t know anything about it. Amazing how many people don’t watch the news, listen to radio or have a computer. Most people have Amber Alerts on their cell phones. Hopefully Law Enforcement could provide an alert to tell everyone about criminal events as heavy as this going on. Everyone be safe out there. Each person knows what they need to do to stay safe inside and outside their home. Rodney on February 7th, 2017 1:07 pm Bill Eddins said he is a very violent and dangerous man, using his criminal past as a guide. Had he never been released there would be families that are not hurting from the loss of their daughter, sister, mother or aunt. Law enforcement works their butts off to apprehend criminals and those in charge of the justice system release immature, ignorant abusers because they don’t want to violate the rights of convicted criminals. Here is a kudos to those in charge of our courts, you chose to let another one go and he has destroyed and taken lives, job well done as you spit in the face of victims, their families and our law enforcement officers. jeeperman on February 7th, 2017 11:24 am So the cops are waiting and wishing for him to make a mistake? nice. Remember, in an earlier article it was stated that there are several felony arrest warrants for him (for how long now?) and he was not picked up. tg on February 7th, 2017 11:20 am Mrs Rice has to be consumed by this man.She hauls the luggage buys the food and ammunition.She has no idea of the sound of crossfire.

Penney Had a Rough January All three department store chains reported disappointing holiday sales results, raising questions about the industry going forward. Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Feb 7, 2017 at 10:21AM What happened Shares of department store chains Macy's (NYSE:M), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), and J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP) tumbled in January, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, dropping 16.2%, 20%, and 20.2%, respectively. All three companies reported lackluster holiday sales results, featuring comparable-sales declines across the board and slashed profit guidance at Macy's and Kohl's. So what The department store industry has been in a funk for years, with total revenue slumping considerably over the past decade. Discounters like Wal-Mart, wholesale clubs like Costco, and online retailers like Amazon.com have all been taking their toll. The department store model of generating gross margin in the mid-30s and advertising heavily to drive store traffic is in genuine peril. Image source: Macy's. The holiday season has become an all-out promotional slugfest to attract foot traffic, and the department stores are losing the battle. Macy's reported a 2.1% decline in comparable sales during November and December, with weakness in handbags and watches hurting its results. The company pointed to changing consumer behavior as having a major impact on sales, and while its e-commerce business grew at a double-digit rate, it's not yet big enough to offset the poor performance of its stores. Macy's slashed its guidance for 2016 due to its poor performance during the holidays. The company now expects comparable sales to slump by around 3%, the low end of its previous guidance range. Adjusted EPS, previously expected between $3.15 and $3.40, is now expected to come in between $2.95 and $3.10. The same story played out at Kohl's. Despite efforts to manage inventory and avoid profit-killing markdowns, Kohl's holiday season was its worst in years. Comparable sales in November and December slumped 2.1%, down from a 0.4% increase during the same period in 2015. The company saw volatile sales throughout the holiday season, with weakness sandwiched between a strong Black Friday and week before Christmas. Kohl's also slashed its full-year guidance in response to its disappointing performance. Adjusted EPS is now expected to come in between $3.60 and $3.65, down from a previous guidance range of $3.80 to $4.00. Gross margin will be lower than anticipated due to the mix and timing of sales and a competitive promotional environment. J.C. Penney's results look best on the surface, but the company's sales are still so depressed that anything short of growth is a disaster. Comparable sales fell 0.8% during November and December for J.C. Penney, a number that would have been viewed as borderline-positive for either Macy's or Kohl's. But J.C. Penney is still unprofitable as is works to slowly recover from the steep sales decline it suffered in 2012, so declining holiday sales are a major problem. J.C. Penney still expects to produce EBITDA of around $1 billion during 2016, and it predicts to continue its recent streak of producing positive operating profit. But interest on its excessive debt load will erase that profit and then some. Now what Action is already being taken in response to the weak holiday results. Macy's announced on Jan. 4 that it plans to close 68 stores by mid-2017, with another 30 expected to be closed over the next few years. The company is also restructuring its operations, with plans to eliminate layers of management, cut non-payroll costs, and reduce its field infrastructure. As part of this effort, 6,200 jobs are expected to be eliminated. Macy's has also been selling some of its real estate, and that effort could intensify going forward as the company looks to unlock value. Rumors of a potential takeover bid from Hudson Bay, the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue, surfaced in February, pushing up the stock as a result. This erased a portion of January's drop, but the stock remains down considerably. J.C. Penney also plans to close some stores, although a concrete strategy hasn't been announced. While most J.C. Penney locations are now profitable, according to CEO Marvin Ellison, sales remain stubbornly low. Kohl's hasn't announced much of anything as a response to its poor holiday season, but store closings in 2017 wouldn't be a surprise. The number of department store locations is set to decline going forward as the industry struggles to compete. Macy's and Kohl's are both possible buyout candidates, with plenty of cash flow generation despite sluggish sales. J.C. Penney has a tougher challenge ahead, with the company still losing money and unable to keep its previous streak of sales growth alive. With the department store industry in turmoil, January's slump in the stock prices of these three companies may be just the beginning. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned.

(Photo Credit: Master Sgt. Raymond Drumsta) VIEW ORIGINAL WATERVLIET, N.Y. -- Members of the New York National Guard's 2nd Civil Support Team shared their expertise in working in tight, cramped places with New York State Police investigators during several days of training that kicked off at the Army's Watervliet Arsenal, here, on Jan. 31. Over several days in a classroom and one of the arsenal's factory buildings, CST troops trained New York State Police Contaminated Crime Scene Emergency Response Team (CCSERT) members how to safely enter confined spaces. The 2nd CST, which is based at Stratton Air National Guard Base, is trained to identify chemical, biological, and radiological agents and advise first-responders on how to deal with these materials. "We work in concert with each other," said Capt. Christopher Giebel the team operations officer. "Their job is to get the evidence, our job is to get the samples." The team is also trained to perform this mission in all kinds of areas, including confined spaces such as grain silos, sewer systems, tunnels, old mine shafts, and collapsed buildings, team members explained. The New York State troopers asked for training in confined area missions because of an incident which occurred in August 2016, explained Technical Sgt. Robert Grace, the New York State Police CCSERT coordinator. CCSERT members were called upon to investigate a methamphetamine lab that was discovered in a long sewer tunnel that ran under a Walmart Parking lot in Amherst, N.Y., Grace recalled. Confined Space Awareness is part of their Mission Essential Task List, he said, and meth labs are an explosive, fire and contamination hazard. "Because of that lab, I wanted to make sure all the teams got some training in Confined Space Awareness," Grace said. "For some of our members, it's the first time doing any type of rope-rescue." Most of that training took place in a vertical shaft at the Arsenal, and involved teaching the CCSERT members how to set up and use a tripod and complex system of ropes and pulleys to enter a confined space. The 200-year old Watervliet Arsenal is the Army's only plant that produces cannons, mortars, and tank guns. To simulate a confined space, the CST and CCSERT members used a vertical shaft and steel platforms that are built into it. The CST troops and CCSERT members assembled the tripod and rope system over an opening in the top platform, then the CCSERT members donned safety harnesses and took turns being lowered and raised in and out of the simulated confined space. The rope system is integral to confined-space rescues, said Sgt. 1st Class Brandon Willit, the 2nd CST reconnaissance NCO, and a Voorheesville, N.Y. resident. It gives rescuers what's known as a "mechanical advantage" or leverage, he explained. Every turn of the rope thru a pulley multiples that leverage, reducing the amount of effort needed to pull weight, Willit said. Without the rope system, confined space rescues would be "almost impossible," he stressed. Spc. Joshua Slish, a 2nd CST member and resident of Colonie, N.Y., said he had fun conducting the training with the CCSERT members. "This is something I enjoy, very hands on," he said. "It gets you out of the classroom." Sharing skills and techniques also builds interoperability and understanding between agencies, Willit and Slish said. Among the agencies, for example, there are many different standard operating procedures for confined-space search-and-rescue, Willit explained. "None of them are wrong, they're just a different way of accomplishing the mission," he said. "It's just a matter of getting everyone on the same page. At the end of the day, we all want to accomplish the mission." In the coming weeks, the 2nd CST will be training about a half-dozen groups of CCSERT members in the Syracuse and Buffalo areas, Giebel said. "It promotes continuity with the two agencies," Giebel said. "It's a good relationship-builder."

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 7 February 2017 by Military News Louisiana’s Top Youth Volunteers Of 2017 Selected By National Program BATON ROUGE, La., Feb. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Anna Katherine Tollett, 16, of Ruston and Zach Morgan, 12, of Denham Springs today were named Louisiana’s top two youth volunteers of 2017 by The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards, a nationwide program honoring young people for outstanding acts of volunteerism. As State Honorees, Anna Katherine and Zach each will receive $1,000, an engraved silver medallion and an all-expense-paid trip in early May to Washington, D.C., where they will join the top two honorees from each of the other states and the District of Columbia for four days of national recognition events. During the trip, 10 students will be named America’s top youth volunteers of 2017. The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards, now in its 22nd year, is conducted by Prudential Financial in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP). These are Louisiana’s top youth volunteers of 2017: Anna Katherine, a junior at Cedar Creek School, has worked tirelessly over the past eight years on behalf of kids who, like her, suffer from Type 1 diabetes, raising funds to find a cure, enhancing public awareness of the disease, campaigning for legal rights and protections for diabetic students, and providing support to newly-diagnosed children and their families. „When I was first diagnosed, the daily demands of managing this relentless disease combined with the often-misinformed public perception of diabetes left me feeling overwhelmed and alienated,” said Anna Katherine. But „because of the support and guidance of family, friends and community, I became determined to reach out to those living with diabetes, and challenge the public perception of the disease.” The day after she left the hospital, Anna Katherine participated in the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation’s annual fundraising walk, and in subsequent years led a team of her own. With help from her father, she shot a 30-second public service announcement about diabetes, which won the top prize in a national contest and has been seen by more than 16,000 viewers. In 2012, Anna Katherine successfully lobbied her state legislature to make it easier for kids to manage their diabetes at school, and then took part in a lobbying effort in Washington, D.C., that secured millions of dollars for diabetes research. She also helped start a foundation that aids kids and their families immediately following a new diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes. Zach, a sixth-grader at Live Oak Middle School, collected more than 5,000 hats and 2,000 toys for kids with cancer, and secured a grant to fund a week-long summer camp for children with the disease. It all started when Zach saw a TV commercial about childhood cancer. „I felt bad for kids who had cancer,” he said. „I felt bad that it changed their childhood. I wanted to make them feel better.” Since he already liked to collect baseball caps, Zach decided to begin collecting them for kids who lose their hair to chemotherapy. He received 250 new caps and hats in his first drive at a local Walmart store, and then threw a pizza party at a local children’s hospital to hand them out. Subsequent drives have yielded thousands of additional hats, which have gone to kids across the country. „I have learned that even the smallest things – like a baseball cap – can put the biggest smile on a kid,” said Zach. He also distributes toys through „Treasure Chests of Courage” that he has placed at several cancer treatment facilities. In addition, Zach has hosted events that have generated more than 1,000 pounds of food for students at local schools who have little to eat on weekends. The program judges also recognized four other Louisiana students as Distinguished Finalists for their impressive community service activities. Each will receive an engraved bronze medallion. These are Louisiana’s Distinguished Finalists for 2017: Nelson Gueho, 17, of Livonia, La., a senior at Catholic High School of Pointe Coupee, led a project to establish a food bank at a fire station in his town, an effort that involved constructing an 8x10x9-foot room, holding a food drive to fill it, and now working with his local chief of police to keep it stocked and maintained on an ongoing basis. The pantry Nelson constructed opened just in time to help people in need after a disastrous flood. Miranda Hawthorne, 17, of Woodworth, La., a senior at Holy Savior Menard Central High School, has collected more than 1,000 pounds of recyclables at her school through „Saving the World One Box at a Time,” a program she created to combat waste. Moved to act after watching a teacher throw away a stack of PowerPoint printouts because she’d printed the wrong one, Miranda delivered recycling boxes to each classroom; she now gathers their contents and takes them to a local recycling plant on a weekly basis. Elizabeth Hughes, 14, of Coushatta, La., an eighth-grader at Red River Junior High School, has conducted various service activities to support senior citizens in her community including helping to build wheelchair ramps so they can move freely in and out of their homes, and helping out at a local nursing home three times a week over the summer. Elizabeth also works with her grandmother to visit the homes of local senior citizens. Macy Wells, 18, of Loranger, La., a senior at Hammond High Magnet School, joined her local fire department as a junior volunteer in May 2016, and since then has served more than 200 hours helping with water rescues, medical emergencies and traumas, including in the aftermath of a recent disastrous flood. Macy, a student in her school’s medical magnet program who aspires to a career in sports medicine, has also volunteered on the sidelines at several games alongside her school’s athletic trainer. „Prudential is honored to recognize these young volunteers for their exemplary service,” said Prudential Chairman and CEO John Strangfeld. „We hope that their stories inspire others to consider how they, too, can volunteer their time and talents to improve their communities.” „These service-minded young people have brought meaningful change to communities at home and abroad, and it’s a privilege to celebrate their work,” said JoAnn Bartoletti, executive director of NASSP. „Congratulations to an exceptional group of middle level and high school students.” The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards represents the United States’ largest youth recognition program based solely on volunteer service. All public and private middle level and high schools in the country, as well as all Girl Scout councils, county 4-H organizations, American Red Cross chapters, YMCAs and HandsOn Network affiliates, were eligible to select a student or member for a local Prudential Spirit of Community Award. These Local Honorees were then reviewed by an independent judging panel, which selected State Honorees and Distinguished Finalists based on criteria including personal initiative, effort, impact and personal growth.  While in Washington, D.C., the 102 State Honorees – one middle level and one high school student from each state and the District of Columbia – will tour the capital’s landmarks, meet top youth volunteers from other parts of the world, attend a gala awards ceremony at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, and visit their congressional representatives on Capitol Hill. On May 8, 10 of the State Honorees – five middle level and five high school students – will be named America’s top youth volunteers of 2017. These National Honorees will receive additional $5,000 awards, gold medallions, crystal trophies and $5,000 grants from The Prudential Foundation for nonprofit charitable organizations of their choice.    Since the program began in 1995, more than 115,000 young volunteers have been honored at the local, state and national level. The program also is conducted by Prudential subsidiaries in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Ireland, India, China and Brazil. In addition to granting its own awards, The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program also distributes President’s Volunteer Service Awards to qualifying Local Honorees.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 7 February 2017 by Military News Indiana’s Top Youth Volunteers Of 2017 Selected By National Program INDIANAPOLIS, Feb. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Grace Zhang, 18, of Carmel and Tara Harmon, 14, of Zionsville today were named Indiana’s top two youth volunteers of 2017 by The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards, a nationwide program honoring young people for outstanding acts of volunteerism. As State Honorees, Grace and Tara each will receive $1,000, an engraved silver medallion and an all-expense-paid trip in early May to Washington, D.C., where they will join the top two honorees from each of the other states and the District of Columbia for four days of national recognition events. During the trip, 10 students will be named America’s top youth volunteers of 2017. The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards, now in its 22nd year, is conducted by Prudential Financial in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP). These are Indiana’s top youth volunteers of 2017: Grace, a senior at Carmel High School, organized a one-day „street store” in Indianapolis last year that enabled more than 200 struggling families to obtain free, gently-used clothing. A couple of winters ago, Grace watched as a homeless man tripped on his baggy pants and fell to the sidewalk. „No one helped him,” she said. „I watched as his dog licked the tears off his face.” That sad image stuck with Grace and prompted her to begin researching organizations that help the poor. She came across Street Store, an international project started in South Africa to give the homeless and people in need a dignified shopping experience. After obtaining instructions and materials from the organization, Grace went to work. She enlisted the help of fellow students in her high school club, contacted local organizations that serve the poor, solicited clothing donations at schools and in the community, and lined up sponsors. The week before her event, Grace was devastated to learn that her beloved grandfather in China was dying. She had a choice: cancel the Street Store or risk never seeing him again. „I knew my grandfather wouldn’t have wanted his illness to impede on charity for the homeless,” she said. So she proceeded to set up her store, and welcomed needy shoppers to choose from among 16,000 articles of donated clothing. Sadly, Grace’s grandfather died without hearing about her successful event. „But I saw my grandfather in every shopper,” she said. Tara, an eighth-grader at Zionsville West Middle School, secured $4,000 in grants and donations over the past three years to provide weekend meals, healthy snacks and school uniforms for inner-city kids in her community. While walking around downtown Indianapolis with her family, Tara frequently encountered homeless people, and it broke her heart. But after seeing a homeless mother and son sleeping on the street, „I went home and thought long and hard,” she said. With encouragement from her parents, Tara began researching ways to help. Through an online search, Tara identified an elementary school with a high rate of free and reduced-price lunches, and while visiting the school, learned about its desperate need for uniforms. She then sought a grant from the Indianapolis Colts and a donation from Walmart; the result was 200 new uniforms for the school. Tara also learned that without subsidized lunches at school, many students go hungry over the summer. She responded by securing another grant and more store donations, and used the money to provide 100 weekend meal packages to summer campers. To encourage healthy eating, Tara also planted a vegetable garden that yielded 600 pounds of produce for an inner-city summer camp. Tara estimates more than 500 kids in need have benefited from her activities. The program judges also recognized six other Indiana students as Distinguished Finalists for their impressive community service activities. Each will receive an engraved bronze medallion. These are Indiana’s Distinguished Finalists for 2017: Katherine Dorsey, 17, of Huntertown, Ind., a senior at Carroll High School, has given out more than 8,500 books to children in need, working with a number of community organizations to share the pleasure of reading with kids who may not have books of their own. Katherine collects books by visiting garage sales with her mom and asking for leftover books, and she further supported her efforts by securing a $500 grant and partnering with a half-price bookstore. Emily Greggs, 18, of Sullivan, Ind., a senior at Sullivan High School, organized „Run For Those Who Can’t,” a 5K run that raised $2,800 for the ALS Foundation and a scholarship named for her late uncle, who was diagnosed with ALS her freshman year. An active community volunteer, Emily has also co-chaired a high-heeled race for men that raised $2,000 for the Sullivan County Community Kitchen, and worked with her HOBY group to organize activities for children in need. Elayna Hasty, 15, of Angola, Ind., a freshman at Angola High School, leads „Girls Against Bullying (G.A.B.) Girls,” a program she started at 9 years old to help its young participants feel strong and confident. Elayna, whose best friend was bullied so badly that she became home-schooled, was moved to develop a program with three main workshops: „Princess Within Me” for girls 5-8; „Stand Up and Speak Out” for boys and girls, and „Free to Be Uniquely Me,” encouraging girls to stand together. Isabelle Hemenway, 13, of Boonville, Ind., a seventh-grader at Boonville Middle School, has mobilized her community to support several charitable causes through „Just a Girl on a Mission,” an effort that’s collected 700 books, 100 items for animal shelters and more. After being provided with a flimsy comb during a hospitalization, Isabelle put out a call for hair product donations for young patients, and when she was able to deliver 300 of them to the hospital’s pediatric unit, she decided to make her collections a regular event. Rachel Kent, 17, of Indianapolis, Ind., a senior at Cathedral High School, runs a charitable business creating and selling friendship bracelets, and donating 100% of her proceeds to a charity helping people in developing countries and making an identical bracelet for a child served by the charity for every one she sells. Rachel has raised more than $1,000 through her „Knot Your Average Bracelets” shop on Etsy, and provided bracelets to children from India to Uganda. Phillip Yang, 18, of Granger, Ind., a senior at Culver Academies, is the head of the Culver Diversity Council promoting respect and inclusion on campus, and recently spent more than five months organizing a diversity day that brought the school community together for a day of celebration and unity. Phillip collaborated with the club advisor, peers and alumni to coordinate the event, which drew more than 800 students to a multicultural fair, student-facilitated workshops, a concert and more. „Prudential is honored to recognize these young volunteers for their exemplary service,” said Prudential Chairman and CEO John Strangfeld. „We hope that their stories inspire others to consider how they, too, can volunteer their time and talents to improve their communities.” „These service-minded young people have brought meaningful change to communities at home and abroad, and it’s a privilege to celebrate their work,” said JoAnn Bartoletti, executive director of NASSP. „Congratulations to an exceptional group of middle level and high school students.” The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards represents the United States’ largest youth recognition program based solely on volunteer service.

Miranda Hawthorne, 17, of Woodworth, La., a senior at Holy Savior Menard Central High School, has collected more than 1,000 pounds of recyclables at her school through “Saving the World One Box at a Time,” a program she created to combat waste. Moved to act after watching a teacher throw away a stack of PowerPoint printouts because she’d printed the wrong one, Miranda delivered recycling boxes to each classroom; she now gathers their contents and takes them to a local recycling plant on a weekly basis. Elizabeth Hughes, 14, of Coushatta, La., an eighth-grader at Red River Junior High School, has conducted various service activities to support senior citizens in her community including helping to build wheelchair ramps so they can move freely in and out of their homes, and helping out at a local nursing home three times a week over the summer. Elizabeth also works with her grandmother to visit the homes of local senior citizens. Macy Wells, 18, of Loranger, La., a senior at Hammond High Magnet School, joined her local fire department as a junior volunteer in May 2016, and since then has served more than 200 hours helping with water rescues, medical emergencies and traumas, including in the aftermath of a recent disastrous flood. Macy, a student in her school’s medical magnet program who aspires to a career in sports medicine, has also volunteered on the sidelines at several games alongside her school’s athletic trainer. “Prudential is honored to recognize these young volunteers for their exemplary service,” said Prudential Chairman and CEO John Strangfeld. “We hope that their stories inspire others to consider how they, too, can volunteer their time and talents to improve their communities.” “These service-minded young people have brought meaningful change to communities at home and abroad, and it’s a privilege to celebrate their work,” said JoAnn Bartoletti, executive director of NASSP. “Congratulations to an exceptional group of middle level and high school students.” About The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards represents the United States’ largest youth recognition program based solely on volunteer service. All public and private middle level and high schools in the country, as well as all Girl Scout councils, county 4-H organizations, American Red Cross chapters, YMCAs and HandsOn Network affiliates, were eligible to select a student or member for a local Prudential Spirit of Community Award. These Local Honorees were then reviewed by an independent judging panel, which selected State Honorees and Distinguished Finalists based on criteria including personal initiative, effort, impact and personal growth.  While in Washington, D.C., the 102 State Honorees – one middle level and one high school student from each state and the District of Columbia – will tour the capital’s landmarks, meet top youth volunteers from other parts of the world, attend a gala awards ceremony at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, and visit their congressional representatives on Capitol Hill. On May 8, 10 of the State Honorees – five middle level and five high school students – will be named America’s top youth volunteers of 2017. These National Honorees will receive additional $5,000 awards, gold medallions, crystal trophies and $5,000 grants from The Prudential Foundation for nonprofit charitable organizations of their choice.    Since the program began in 1995, more than 115,000 young volunteers have been honored at the local, state and national level. The program also is conducted by Prudential subsidiaries in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Ireland, India, China and Brazil. In addition to granting its own awards, The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program also distributes President’s Volunteer Service Awards to qualifying Local Honorees.

WORX BladeRunner X2 makes an ideal gift for DIY valentines who have a creative streak. Charlotte, N.C. (PRWEB) February 07, 2017 This year, Valentine’s Day gift-givers should consider surprising their favorite handypersons with a new WORX tool innovation, such as the WORX BladeRunner X2, WORX 20V MaxLithium Switchdriver, WORX SD SemiAutomatic Driver with Screw Holder or WORXSAW Compact Circular Saw. Most do-it-yourselfers would gladly swap a traditional Valentine’s Day remembrance for a tool gift that continues to be appreciated long after the roses have faded and the box of bonbons is empty. This break with romantic gifting tradition rings true for both women and men tool lovers. In fact, Census Bureau data show there are more than 18 million women homeowners in the U.S. According to the National Association of Realtors, they account for 23 percent of all first-time buyers and 16 percent of repeat buyers. Many of these women homeowners are do-it-yourself enthusiasts. The new WORX BladeRunner X2 makes an ideal gift for DIY valentines who have a creative streak. The portable benchtop saw uses assorted, T-shank, jigsaw blades to cut wood, PVC, plastic, aluminum and other non-ferrous metals, as well as ceramic tile. It weighs less than 15 lbs. and can easily be carried to the project’s location. BladeRunner X2 is ideal for building a bird feeder, trellis, potting table, garage shelving, garden bench or Adirondack chair. It scrolls decorative rails, panels and corner braces for gazebos, pergolas or privacy fences. Quickly cut PVC to design a towel rack or bike stand. Create metal lawn ornaments or ceramic-tile tabletops, trivets and coasters. Changing blades is simple. Just press down and slide the blade release lever on the left side of the saw to seat or release the blade. Once the blade is in position, guide rollers ensure accurate 90 degree cutting at all times. WORX BladeRunner X2 (WX572L, $99.99) is available at worx.com and online retailers including Walmart and Amazon. WORX 20V MaxLithium Switchdriver is a new twist on Valentine’s Day giving. This one-of-a-kind, cordless drill/driver has a rotating head equipped with two ¼-inch chucks to load various combinations of bits. The homeowner can drill a pilot hole, and then rotate the head to switch chucks and sink the screw with a driver bit. Switchdriver is handy for installing blinds or shelves with drywall anchors and completing assembly projects with different bit types and sizes. Switchdriver weighs only 3 lbs. (with battery) and has an 11-position clutch with electronic torque control to prevent stripping of screws. The cordless drill/driver features a comfortable overmold grip, hand guard and LED work light. It includes two 20V, 1.5 Ah batteries, a five-hour charger, two drill bits (1/8 in., 3/32 in.) and one #2 Phillips bit. The tool is covered by the WORX 3-year warranty.

The user simply slides back the cover to load a bit, and then slides the cover forward for driving screws. Since bits are stored in the cylinder, lost or misplaced bits are never a problem.

President Donald Trump, at a press conference during his visit to CENTCOM on Monday, claimed the media "doesn't want to report" on terrorist attacks involving Islamic radicals, but gave no examples of stories that went uncovered. The White House then provided a list of 78 attacks from September 2014 to December 2016 that officials claimed got short shrift from the news media. A review of the archives revealed NBC News covered 57 of the attacks on the list. Those 57 attacks resulted in the deaths of 745 people — including the Paris terrorist attacks in November 2015, which killed 130 people and resulted in hundreds of stories. Appeals Court Denies Bid to Reinstate Trump Travel Ban The 21 attacks NBC News did not cover were smaller incidents in places like Egypt, Bosnia or Bangladesh, and the suspects were described only as "unidentified" or "unidentified ISIL" operatives. Also on the White House list was another terrorist attack that was covered widely by both the U.S. and foreign media — the December 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, which killed 14 people. NBC News' archives have at least 162 stories that mentioned the suspects.  Trump Signs Executive Orders on Lobbying Ban, Security President Donald Trump signed three more executive orders Saturday, Jan. 28, 2017. The orders are for a reorganization of National Security Council to respond to new threats, a ban for administration officials from lobbying, and a request for Joint Chiefs of Staff to come up with a plan to defeat ISIS within 30 days.

The little boy witnessed a nasty fight between his mom, Kailyn, and his stepdad, Javi, on the Jan. 30 episode of ‘Teen Mom 2.’ Apparently, Javi showed up to Kailyn’s house unannounced, and she wasn’t very happy because she had a ‘special guest’ over. To find out what happened, read our recap below! Kailyn and Javi already got into a few arguments after he returned home from deployment, but their fight on the Jan. 30 episode of Teen Mom 2 was bigger than the others. It was so nasty, in fact, that Kailyn begged Jo to come take Isaac for the week — she didn’t want him to witness any more drama than he already had. Their fight originated when Javi showed up to Kailyn’s house unannounced. He just wanted to get his stuff. She told him to wait an hour before stopping by because she was “at Walmart,” but when he drove by and saw her car, he thought he’d drop Lincoln off and get his stuff. However, when he knocked on the door, she wouldn’t allow him to come in because she had a guest over. Obviously, it was a male guest, so Javi freaked and they just had a huge argument. Kailyn refused to film after it happened, and cameras failed to catch the initial drama, so we were left to hear about everything from Javi and his friends. Meanwhile, Jenelle tried her best to keep her pregnancy a secret from her mom. She and David took Barbara and Jace to the plot of land they bought, but Jenelle’s stomach was popping out of her shirt. Even so, she still denied having a bun in the oven. She and David told producers they want to wait until they know the gender before telling everyone the good news. Click here to see more pics from ‘Teen Mom 2’! And speaking of waiting, Chelsea and Cole decided that it’d be best to put their wedding on hold. Chelsea said she didn’t want to plan a wedding while pregnant, so they’d still get married legally, but put the wedding on hold until after the baby’s born. Oh yeah, and Adam showed up to Aubree‘s baseball game, where he yelled at producers and told them to get the cameras out of his face. He’s so pleasant. Lastly, Leah and Corey were left to deal with the aftermath of the flooding in West Virginia. The twins’ school was closed, so they were forced to pick another school for them. They both expected to fight about it, but surprisingly, they came to a reasonable conclusion rather quickly — without arguing!

The latest such criminal activity occurred on the university campus at Berkeley, Calif., supposedly caused by the speaking engagement there of Milo Yiannopoulos, editor of the conservative Breitbart News organization. Seems some Berkeley students felt so threatened by any words Milo might deliver that they were willing to risk jail time by lapsing into hissy fits not unlike 4-year-olds in Wal-Mart after learning there will be no candy bar at checkout. That's why I was smiling a day or so afterwards to see dozens of students and alums of John Brown University in Siloam Springs stand to maturely protest the campus appearance of former governor and GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee. The agginers made their points of disagreement known. Huckabee listened and responded in an equally civil fashion. About 600 others also had joined a Facebook group sympathetic to the protesters' cause. Nowadays in America, with even full-grown marchers wearing ridiculous costumes designed to resemble female sexual anatomy while innocent civilians are beaten in city streets for their beliefs, normality and common sense are easily recognized. Unlike the rioting at Berkeley, the gathering at JBU was a legitimate protest where contrasting ideas and points of view were thoughtfully exchanged. Following his speech, Huckabee made time to listen to his detractors. And the protesters, most of whom were promoting love and a dislike for Donald Trump's policies, responded likewise. In fact, the crowded auditorium contained a far larger audience of those welcoming Huckabee along with the protesters. Matt Feyerabend, an alumni protest leader, afterwards expressed pride in the peaceful and respectful manner that characterized their exchange. He told reporter Jenelle Jesson: "Their ability to remain peaceful and respectful was very inspiring. Everyone listened, laughed and I believe clapped for him [Huckabee] when he was done. The civil display of opposition to his divisive rhetoric was beautiful. I think we all realize more than ever that we must stand for love." A beautiful and admirable sentiment indeed. Of course, I've never seen Huckabee as one who has any problem freely exhibiting respect and appreciation even when he disagrees. I also wonder how the noble aspiration for universal love applies to the many thousands of Christians who've been (and continue to be) savagely tortured and slaughtered by radical Islamists in the Middle East who carry no such thing for any others. I call it evil. Unfortunately it exists inside the dark spirits of far too many humans across the globe. Sheriff still crusading It's good to see Baxter County Sheriff John "Monty" Montgomery continuing his justifiable crusade to stop Arkansas' disgraceful revolving door of putting convicts behind bars only to quickly set them free. Our state certainly deserves better than a woefully ineffective and wrongheaded system that continues to inflict the same criminal elements on a law-abiding public. Montgomery, whose campaign for reform also was the focus of a recent newscast by KY3 in Springfield, Mo., produced statistics showing that in his county alone, chronic convicts have been paroled over and over again only to commit the same offenses. I can't help but visualize going up an escalator, using the restroom and grabbing a sip of water, then heading down the other side to repeat the same circle again and again. Most of these crimes in Montgomery's northernmost county of 42,000 souls involve robberies, breaking and entering theft and drug offenses. "In the last two months we have had people paroled in Baxter County who have been to prison three, five, seven, 11 and 15 times," he said, adding that a convict given a six-year sentence today is likely to only spend a whopping six months behind bars. "Most people mistakenly think if someone violates their parole they are sent back to prison to serve the rest of their sentence," Montgomery told me. "That couldn't be further from the truth. We have found typically that our parole revocation cases end up being for just six months unless they're let out earlier due to overcrowding." If all this weren't overwhelming enough, Montgomery said the average caseload for his parole and probation officers is 190 convicts. How bad is it in your county, valued readers? Missouri is moving forward with fresh legislation to crack down on their repeat-offender problem. I'd say it's long past time for Arkansas to follow suit and make the madness stop. ------------v------------ Mike Masterson's column appears regularly in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

February 7, 2017 at 5:07 a.m. Masterson, do some research for a change when writing a column. Even the campus police said those arrested were not Berkeley students. Later reports tied those arrested to the "black bloc" anarchist group. If you're going to try to make a feeble point, at least do the leg work. That's what the D-G pays you for, or maybe not. Your credibility as an informed columnist fades with every piece you attempt to write on national issues. You might also note that the Women's March in DC, far greater than that JBU protest, had zero arrests. In fact, across the nation millions marched and none were arrested. But you ignore those facts also. ( permalink | suggest removal ) WhododueDiligence says... February 7, 2017 at 8:19 a.m. Mainstream newspaper columnist Mike Masterson once again has a hissy fit about word choice in the mainstream media. And he soft-pedals edgy Breitbart agitation by labeling it merely "conservative" . What a riot. ( permalink | suggest removal ) hah406 says... February 7, 2017 at 8:42 a.m. Mike, you do realize (but don't mention) that JBU is a private Christian school that would expel a student who misbehaved in a heartbeat. That said, the students there conducted themselves in a way that brought honor and pride to themselves and their institution. Too bad they can't teach your boy Trump how to have similar, civil discourse. ( permalink | suggest removal ) kdc72701 says... February 7, 2017 at 10:09 a.m. It is becoming clear that the riots at Berkeley were not done by students. A group co-opted a peaceful student protest to riot. The rioters were all dressed in black with strange paramilitary gear. They were not likely Berkeley students. Just an FYI. ( permalink | suggest removal ) kdc72701 says... February 7, 2017 at 10:11 a.m. Sorry I see RBear already made that point and with more detailed info. ( permalink | suggest removal ) Lifelonglearner says... February 7, 2017 at 5:34 p.m. On top of everything else, you played along with the hype that only Christians are being persecuted by ISIS. Muslims and others that do not follow their radical fundamentalist interpretations suffer just as much. ( permalink | suggest removal ) carpenterretired says... February 7, 2017 at 6:42 p.m. If only a time machine could take Mike back to the early 17th century and the wars of the reformation ,in the Thirty Years war between Catholics and Lutherans around 40% of the total population of the German areas was killed by one Christian side or the other by savage torturing and slaughtered by radical Christians . For a good old southern boy like Mike a good time machine trip would be to a late 19th century KKK oak tree rope party by good Christian folk ,KKK had a good selection of evangelical preachers that would have impressed Mike. ( permalink | suggest removal ) 23cal says... February 8, 2017 at 6:51 a.m. About "I also wonder how the noble aspiration for universal love applies to the many thousands of Christians who've been (and continue to be) savagely tortured and slaughtered by radical Islamists in the Middle East who carry no such thing for any others." * This illustrates the tone deaf Islamophobia of Masterson and his ilk. Yo, Mike.......what about the tens of "thousands of C̶h̶r̶i̶s̶t̶i̶a̶n̶s̶ Muslims who've been (and continue to be) savagely tortured and slaughtered by radical Islamists in the Middle East...."? You make it clear that they are nothing more than chopped liver to you and in your opinion the only people worthy of aid are Christians. * Too bad Obamacare doesn't cover treatment for a tin ear.

The social media revolt spurred a viral #DeleteUber and even caused dissent within his own company. The 40-year-old billionaire, in a statement made available to the Wall Street Journal, pointed out that his participation on the council had been misconstrued to mean an endorsement of the 70-year-old President’s policies. “Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the President or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that.” Uber Technologies CEO Travis Kalanick leaves president’s business council https://t.co/e0djLp1Iq3 — Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) February 3, 2017 Mr. Kalanick was expected to join other participants Friday, including Walt Disney and Wal-Mart CEOs Bob Iger and Doug McMillon, as well as Tesla Inc’s chief executive, Elon Musk and JP Morgan Chase’s chief executive Jamie Dimon. The group was billed to meet for the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum in Washington D.C. However, the Uber CEO had informed the President beforehand that he was backing out of the council. “I spoke briefly with the President about the immigration executive order..I also let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council.” Customers and drivers had accused the Uber CEO, who has a net worth of $6 billion, of getting cozy with the Trump administration in the aftermath of the executive order banning the travel of citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries to the U.S. The White House had asserted that ‘extreme vetting” was required to keep terrorists from finding their way into America. Many people saw it as a crack-down contrary to the ideals of American diversity. #DeleteUber reportedly led 200,000 people to delete their accounts https://t.co/5GtEGS5oMW pic.twitter.com/ndmjP4oenn — The Verge (@verge) February 3, 2017 The avalanche of criticism towards the ride sharing and car hire service had spiraled out of control with many people, including celebrities, gingering people to delete the Uber app from their smart devices. The revolt picked up over the weekend when the San-Francisco based company tweeted that it was halting a price increase to John F. Kennedy International Airport. The decision came at a time when traditional drivers had suspended their services to protest the travel ban. Observers felt that Uber was trying to take advantage of a lull in transport services and make more money. Others believed car services did not fully grind to a halt, it would sabotage the full thrust of the protest. According to the Business Insider, more than 200,000 people deleted their accounts. By Thursday, the Independent Guild, a group of Uber drivers based in New York began circulating a petition for Kalanick to pull out from President Trump’s economic council. The group in a bid to sympathize with enraged customers also suggested that the company make a donation to attorneys and non-profits fighting the travel ban. #uber pledges $3 million for drivers affected by immigration banhttps://t.co/rPx3blVpLw pic.twitter.com/VXqIy90GiV — Express Tribune Tech (@ETribuneTech) January 30, 2017 Kalanick had met with Uber employees before he resigned making the point that being on the council would have positioned the company to influence change and express dissatisfaction from within. Many of his staffers thought he was giving a rationale on why he would remain on the council. The co-founder of the peer-to-peer file sharing company, Red Swoosh, gave no indication he was going to resign. Despite Kalanick’s withdrawal from the advisory council, protests are still penciled to go ahead across the country, including in New Orleans, New York, and San Francisco. The Uber CEO’s resignation is only one of the many blowbacks the President has received since assuming office over two weeks ago. This week, department-store giant, Nordstrom announced that they were cutting ties with Ivanka Trump and would not be selling any of her fashion products on their website, as reported by the Inquisitr. Elon Musk says he will raise objections to Trump's immigration order at a meeting at the White House on Friday https://t.co/fUN3C1gFd2 pic.twitter.com/nS8oJcoczC — CNN (@CNN) February 3, 2017 Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has insisted that despite the resignation of the Uber CEO, he will remain on the council. The 45-year-old revealed that his presence at the advisory council meetings did not mean he aligned himself with the Trump administration. Musk, who is worth a reported $13 billion, pointed out that his presence will “on balance serve the greater good.” [Featured Image by Paul Sakluma/AP Images] Now Watch This: Palestinian Hairdresser Uses Blowtorch On Clients Now Read This: Indian ‘Stigmata’ Boy Perplexes Doctors, Teen Bleeds Randomly 10 Times A Day Share 1 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Tito Ojo-Medubi Tags: #deleteuber, Travis Kalanick, trump muslim ban, donald trump 100 days November 3, 2013 Kendall Jenner Turns 18, Porn Offers Flood Her Inbox November 3, 2013 Nick Foles Throws 7 TDs, Ties NFL Record Comments LATEST HEADLINES ‘The Walking Dead’ Producer Says Alexandria Will Be Heroes In Season 7B ‘Spy In The Wild’: New PBS Show Reveals Secret Life Of Animals [Video] Anna Nicole Smith Still Dotes On Daughter Dannielynn From Beyond The Grave George Clooney Disobeyed The 12-Week Rule To Tell Matt Damon His Baby News Blue Ridge, Texas: Seaway Pipeline Spill Was The Second One In A Year Jimmy Fallon V.

Then there's Eagle Lake's $565,000 share to replace the forest main," Mankato community development director Paul Vogel said.   Also discussed was the median situation in between the 22 and Haefner roundabouts. Businesses were concerned about being cut off to would-be eastbound diners. While the council initially shared that skepticism, it appears after the potential stacking traffic problem was further explained, they'd be toward a full median on that stretch of road. If all goes according to plan, the city would like construction to begin on May first. For the first three months, the project would focus on the extension east. Phase 2, which would be the roundabout at Haefner and Adams, would begin July 31st. The city hopes to have the major parts of construction finished by September 1st. -- Ryan Gustafson, KEYC News 12.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon President Donald Trump and top U.S. executives had a spirited, balanced discussion about tax issues during a gathering Friday, according to Blackstone Group LP Chief Executive Officer Steve Schwarzman, who attended the meeting. “It was spirited intellectually,” Schwarzman said in an interview on CNBC, adding that differing views were raised about the new administration’s proposed border-adjusted tax, which would put tariffs on imports. Some companies run by leaders in attendance, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s Doug McMillon, have disagreed with Trump and Congressional Republicans on the proposal. “You don’t want to do something that hurts a significant part of the economy, but you want to get benefits from the exports,” Schwarzman said. “Both sides have good points.” Trump invited 18 executives to the White House to discuss topics ranging from trade and education to women’s roles in the workforce. He called the members “the biggest and best minds in the country.” Trump appointed Schwarzman, who has a net worth of $11 billion, as chairman of the council in December, with the goal of receiving advice on economic growth and job creation from a group of business leaders. Uber Technologies Inc. CEO Travis Kalanick was conspicuously absent. Kalanick gave up his committee position Thursday amid uproar from customers and drivers about the connection to the administration. Staying on the council would “get in the way” of advocating for immigration values that are important to the country and to Uber, he wrote in an e-mail to employees. “Travis was in a really difficult spot,” Schwarzman said Friday. “His business was being very adversely affected, he had discontent among his employees.” While the Blackstone chief called the White House meeting private, declining to say who spoke about which topics, he said that infrastructure, China and immigration came up during the conversation. “Each came with a long list of things that can be done — some very quickly, some take a little longer,” Schwarzman said. “The receptivity to that was instant.” After the meeting, Schwarzman departed Washington on Air Force One to Palm Beach, Florida, where he and Trump have homes.

Advocates said a proposed bill by Rep. Brenda Kupchick would match state laws on child seats to national recommendations. Appeals Court Denies Bid to Reinstate Trump Travel Ban Currently in Connecticut a child needs to be in a rear-facing child seat until age one or weighing 20 pounds, according to the legislation.  "Any person who transports a child under one year of age or weighing less than twenty pounds in a motor vehicle on the highways of this state shall provide and require the child to ride rear-facing in a child restraint system approved pursuant to regulations that the Department of Motor Vehicles shall adopt in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54."

"They can crisscross their feet, they can touch the back of the seat with their feet, but that isn't a concern. Our concern is the spinal cord,” said Jason Cioci, a firefighter with Poquonnock Bridge Fire Department. He’s also part of The Safety Group.

(Published Monday, Feb. 6, 2017) A New Haven teacher is suing the Board of Education over what she calls inadequate accommodations for her disability.  “I was walking when I first started here,” Paula Langlois said. Appeals Court Denies Bid to Reinstate Trump Travel Ban But six years later, the fifth grade teacher needs a wheelchair to get around. “I have multiple sclerosis and it is now secondary progressive,” Langlois said.

BBC News1:13 Trump meets with airlines CNBC2:00 This is the world's most expensive chocolate bar CNBC0:39 Honoured Apple CEO takes aim at Trump Reuters1:31 UP NEXT As Washington mulls a tax on imports, an auto industry study suggests the policy would deliver the sharpest blow to Tata Motors Ltd.’s Jaguar Land Rover while giving a leg up to Tesla Inc. and Ford Motor Co. Quotes in the article Tata Motors Ltd TTM ▲ 38.09 +0.05 +0.13% Ford Motor Co F ▲ 12.51 +0.13 +1.05% General Motors Co GM ▲ 35.17 +0.09 +0.26% Mazda Motor Corp MZDAY ▲ 6.91 +0.08 +1.17% In what it calls a “thought exercise,” industry researcher Baum & Associates LLC estimates that most automakers would need to raise vehicle prices by thousands of dollars -- more than $17,000 per vehicle in Jaguar Land Rover’s case -- to recoup higher costs incurred under the House Republican-proposed border-adjusted tax. Ford would need to mull the smallest price hike among major automakers, at about $282 per vehicle, followed by General Motors Co. at $995, according to the report. The estimates aim to show the relative impact of the tax plan on each automaker, according to Alan Baum, the founder of West Bloomfield, Michigan-based Baum & Associates. Carmakers are unlikely to raise prices by more than a few thousand dollars per car and would also likely have to foot some of the higher tax burden. “The plan results in a net cost for automakers,” Baum said by phone. “Each company will then make its own decisions on pricing in order to best compete and maximize its profits.” Volvo and VW vehicle prices would have to rise by about $7,600 and $6,800 on average, according to estimates by Baum & Associates, which advises suppliers. President Donald Trump is said to be warming to the border-adjusted tax after initially viewing it as too complicated. The proposal to begin levying companies’ imports and domestic sales and make exports tax-exempt would completely overhaul the U.S. tax code. General Electric Co. and Boeing Co. are among U.S. manufacturers getting behind the idea, while Toyota Motor Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are among the corporate giants warning it will result in costlier products ranging from food and clothing to gasoline and auto parts. © Ryan Beene and John Lippert   The Baum & Associates report accounts for imports of both finished vehicles and parts for domestic cars that are made overseas. The one automaker that may be able to keep prices steady would be Model S sedan maker Tesla. The proposed border tax may induce automakers to boost U.S. parts procurement and production from existing vehicle assembly plants, according to the report. Overseas automakers including Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.’s Subaru, Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Mazda Motor Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. may also consider expanding existing U.S. operations or building new capacity. Hurting Neighbors If auto sales slow, the tax would create an incentive for automakers to keep U.S. plants running at the expense of those in Canada and Mexico. That could encourage Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to accelerate the conversion of its factory in Sterling Heights, Michigan, to build light-duty pickups there instead of Mexico, and to add medium- and heavy-duty truck output at the plant, said Dan Luria, an economist at the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center in Ann Arbor and the lead author of the Baum & Associates report. Nissan Motor Co. might export more from Mexico to Latin American markets and less to the U.S. Volkswagen AG could build another U.S. assembly plant. Mazda and Mitsubishi, which rely entirely on imports to the U.S. market, may have to quit the U.S. market or pay other manufacturers to assemble their cars, Luria said. In its current form, the proposed border tax could lead to the production of up to 1 million additional vehicles in the U.S. and 50,000 more jobs at car and part assembly plants, Luria said. In a separate report Wednesday, Colin Langan, an analyst at UBS Securities LLC, said the proposed border tax could raise average prices in the U.S. by about 8 percent, or $2,500 per vehicle. That’s enough to reduce annual sales by about 2 million vehicles, he said. Langan said he expects a draft bill to be released in late February or early March. He pegged the chances of a border tax being enacted at less than 50 percent. The tax has a good chance of making its way through the House of Representatives but is “very unlikely” to pass in the Senate, Langan said.

With automation poised to sweep through the economy, some fear that it will kill more jobs than it creates. But Cifarelli’s experience is the opposite. She befriended automation, instead of fighting it, and she has a job because of it. “I haven’t named it,” she said, peering over at the robotic machinery. “I should name it.” Cifarelli is one of 33 employees at Marlin Steel, which has undergone a transformation. Employees used to make wire baskets by hand. Now automation has taken over. High-tech machines do most of the work — and the plant needs workers willing to adapt their skill sets to survive in a rapidly changing economy. Automation has allowed Marlin Steel to thrive, but across the country, workers feel threatened. Donald Trump catapulted into the White House by giving voice to those fears and promising to save American factories and jobs by rewriting trade deals, taxing imports and removing regulations. Futurists have warned for years that automation will take your job. Now it's happening, albeit in pockets, at manufacturers, warehouses and even some labor-intensive white-collar professions. As the political debate rages over how to inject fresh energy into the American economy with Trump taking office, automation presents perhaps the greatest threat to the American economy. But it may also reflect its greatest opportunity if workers take the Cifarelli route and embrace robotics, artificial intelligence and automation. Either way, it’s poised to accelerate — and if not here, then in foreign countries that will reap the benefits while the American economy suffers a competitive disadvantage. About 49% of worker activities can be turned over to some sort of machine or robot, increasingly helped along by artificial-intelligence software, according to consultancy McKinsey. About 58% of CEOs plan to cut jobs over the next five years because of robotics, while 16% say they plan to hire more people because of robotics, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers survey. As artificial intelligence programs proliferate, automation won't be confined to the factory floor. Positions that involve a substantial amount of predictable work, such as data processing, could succumb to automated software and artificial intelligence. McKinsey counted more than 70 entire professions in which at least 90% of activities can be automated, ranging from mail clerks to ophthalmic lab technicians, tire-repairers, butchers, food preparers and bakers. But many Americans don’t think they need to adapt, with 80% saying their job definitely or probably will exist in its current form in 50 years, according to the Pew Research Center. “We often think about automation as applying to front-line, low-wage, low-skill activities and jobs — and what we’ve discovered is there are some activities that are high-wage, high-skill that are actually very susceptible to automation,” said Michael Chui, a McKinsey Global Institute partner in San Francisco who studies the issue. “Almost every job in the economy has a significant percentage of activities that can be automated." The professional service robot industry expects to sell a third more units from 2016 through 2019 — 333,200 in all — than it sold in the past 17 years, says the International Federation of Robotics. They could be used in place of professionals, whether it's medicine, agriculture, hospitality or even the supermarket down the street. Consider: —Restaurant workers. In fast-food, San Francisco-based Momentum Machines already makes a hamburger-flipping robot. Several chains are gradually introducing self-ordering stations. —Shelf stockers. In stores, San Francisco-based Bossa Nova Robotics has developed a robot that is checking shelf inventory in a test at Lowe’s, the home-improvement chain. —Journalists. Automated Insights has created a software suite called WordSmith that writes thousands of automated stories every month, including Minor League Baseball game accounts and earnings reports for the Associated Press, basketball game recaps for Yahoo! Sports and financial content for dozens of other clients, —Bookkeepers. Accountants — perceived as a steady 9-to-5 job with an average salary of $67,190 in 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics — are poised for a total makeover. About one in five people in the finance and insurance sector primarily perform data processing — and about 85% of that work can be automated, McKinsey estimates. Predictability “The basic gist of it is the more certainty your job entails the more likely is to be automated out,” said Mary (Missy) Cummings, a Duke University professor and director of the Humans and Autonomy Lab. In other words, the more predictable your daily routine is, the more likely your job is to go away. It’s already happening. Walmart announced plans in September to cut 7,000 bookkeeping and store accounting positions as it automates cash management and centralizes the process at its headquarters. In accounting, nimble firms will transition their focus to advising clients based on insights gleaned from automated data. Audits may go from an annual process to a continuous action. Software will increasingly handle the “high-volume, routine, non-judgmental” activities in real time, said Bill Brennan, audit transformation leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers. PwC is now hiring employees for its auditing business with backgrounds in science, technology and engineering. “We need those individuals to help us as we get into data analysis, analytics, data security, cloud computing. The future employee is going to have a combination of those skills,” Brennan said. Cifarelli knows. At Marlin Steel, her college-level education pays off in production work. Pecking periodically at a computer mouse, she delivers detailed instructions, programming the machine to carve small canyons in wood to hold wire that is later welded together with automated equipment to make precision wire baskets, accurate to within 2/1000ths of an inch. She's bonded with her CNC, which she has come to think of as a robot companion. “I need the robot to ensure consistency,” Cifarelli said. “Over the past year, I’ve become really accustomed to the sounds and the movements of it. I can really predict what’s gonna happen. We’re kind of a team.” For Marlin Steel, the problem was straightforward: Automate or die. In the early 2000s, factory workers at the 48-year-old company were forming the big metal baskets typically seen in bagel shops by hand-bending wire at a rate of 300 bends per hour in a grueling manual process for producing for wire baskets that typically hold bagels. “They all had huge right arms,” Marlin Steel CEO and owner Drew Greenblatt said.© Provided by USA Today When emerging overseas competitors swooped in and undercut the company on labor costs, producing baskets for less than $6 each to Marlin’s $12, sales cratered. “Our entire business model blew up and we were hemorrhaging,” Greenblatt said. “China was exporting baskets into Manhattan for cheaper than I could buy the steel.” To fight back, the company purchased robotic wire-forming machines and other automated equipment to manufacture precision wire baskets and other metal products for customers that required a higher-quality product, such as Boeing, General Motors, Harley-Davidson and Disney. Because of automation, Marlin Steel nearly doubled its workforce over the last decade to 33 employees and boosted pay from minimum wage when Greenblatt acquired the company to at least $15 per hour today, with some employees making more than $30. “It’s only viable because my employees are like on steroids,” Greenblatt said. “All of a sudden they’re super productive and it’s because we’ve given them the tools — it’s robotics and automation. Thank God for robots. If it wasn’t for robots, these guys would be unemployed.” Foreign competition Marlin Steel may have been ahead of its time. Industrial robots have hit an inflection point — powered by cost reductions and technological improvements in visioning, sensing and gripping — and are poised to accelerate. Although they only perform 10% of tasks in manufacturing today, they will perform 25% by 2025, according to a study by Boston Consulting Group. In one tangible sign of increased automation, those technological improvements have ushered in the dawn of the “collaborative robot,” unleashing automation from protective cages and placing the machinery right next to humans, with sensors protecting the worker and ensuring efficiency. Barclays analysts estimate that global sales of so-called “cobots” will balloon from 4,100 units and $120 million in 2015 to 701,000 and $12 billion in 2025. And it's happening globally. China, for example, is not wasting any time. Amid all the political consternation over alleged currency manipulation and global trade advantages, China is expected to double its installation of industrial robots from 75,000 in 2015 to 150,000 in 2018, nearly four times the rate of North America, according to the International Federation of Robotics. Trump has repeatedly pledged to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., even suggesting that Apple’s iPhone could be made here and exhorting Apple CEO Tim Cook to do so. But that might not be possible without massive automation to make it cost-effective to manufacture in the U.S. Apple’s iPhone manufacturer, Foxconn, in fact, has already begun automating certain work that was previously done by hand. A Chinese government official told a Hong Kong newspaper in May that Foxconn had replaced 60,000 workers with robots at one factory there. And the company is receiving incentives north of Shanghai in the eastern-central Jiangsu Province to accelerate investments in robotics to replace human labor, according to Chinese state media organization Xinhua.  As automation advances, globalization will enter a new chapter in which low-cost labor becomes increasingly irrelevant. Unlike humans, robots don’t get paid an hourly wage. So it’s not much more expensive to operate a machine in a developed economy than it is in the developing world. That could be good news for America because it may slow the outflow of investment to other countries. “The fastest growing robotics user in the world is China because they understand that they want a lot of this manufacturing based on low-cost labor, but that’s not the whole game,” said Jeff Burnstein, president of the Association for Advancing Automation. “The game now more than ever is quality, speed and flexibility — and low-cost labor alone is not gonna do it.” The downsides Automation is a double-edged sword, though. Take the example of family-owned Ramsey, Minn.-based injection molder Dynamic Group. The company recently boosted its production by 400% after installing robotic arms made by Universal Robots. Automation bolstered the company’s capability to produce lower-volume, highly complex products that would otherwise not be profitable because the company could not afford to hire workers to craft and manufacture devices with limited commercial appeal. “It’s really hard to be able to be competitive nation- and worldwide coming from this market and having to do that type of labor,” said Joe McGillivray, CEO of Dynamic Group, whose father co-founded the company in 1977. “We’re able to do more work, which will allow us to make more money and pay you better.” Still, the downsides of automation are impossible to ignore. As advanced manufacturing companies adopt more automation, many workers won’t be needed. McGillivray said that by installing robots, Dynamic Group expects to reduce its reliance on temporary workers. In the past, the company had occasionally hired up to 20 temp workers to aid its permanent staff of 106 workers. “We would instead be using robots as our flex labor instead of people as our flex labor,” he said. Artificial intelligence If automation evokes imagery of robots replacing humans, then its close relative, artificial intelligence, conjures fears of computers taking dominion over humans. But those fears, while perhaps not unfounded in the distant future, fail to reflect AI’s emerging role as an assistant to people in the workplace. At Boston-based start-up Lola, two executives who were almost single-handedly responsible for replacing travel agents with computers — that is, one of automation’s most obvious examples of displacement — are reviving the travel agent through artificial intelligence. The 50-person company has developed an AI-based system — which basically just means a bunch of software algorithms — to aid human travel agents in making recommendations to travelers, booking accommodations and addressing itinerary hiccups.  “We think most travelers would rather talk to a human because the human will understand them 100% of the time, so we use the bots to back them up,” said Lola CEO Paul English, who co-founded travel listings site Kayak.com and served as the company’s chief technology officer. “If we’re successful we’ll have thousands of travel agents, perhaps tens of thousands of travel agents working exclusively for Lola.” The AI, which English affectionately refers to as a bot, can crawl through a user’s email inbox, for example, to identify travel preferences and scheduling quirks. Those insights are translated into intelligence that the travel agents use to improve their customer's experience. For Lola Chairman Barney Harford, former CEO of travel booking site Orbitz and former executive at Expedia, it’s a sharp turn from his previous life ushering in the age of do-it-yourself travel. “We are bringing humans back into the picture,” Harford said.  Click ahead to read about how to make your job automation proof. Part 2: How to make your job automation proof For Canyon Gamble, robots aren’t the enemy — they’re a ticket to prosperity. The 19-year-old last year chose a decidedly high-tech career path, completing a special automation certification program at the tech center known in Marion, Ohio, simply as RAMTEC. It's already paying off. “I’ve had two or three job offers just in the past month,” he said, noting chances to work on computer-aided design (CAD) and 3D CAD. “I don’t need a college degree just because of how the field works. If you can prove you can do it, you most likely can get the job." At a time when automation is poised to eliminate entire professions across America, students like Gamble and some industry professionals are trying to outrun the revolution. For workers to survive with good jobs that are increasingly automated, it's worth considering the old adage: If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em. Or in this case, gain skills in programming, maintaining or fixing industrial robots or automated software. One strategy is to embrace a profession with little predictable work. Those automation-proof jobs include posts such as special education teacher, transit police, tree trimmer, purchasing agent, multimedia artist and animator, psychiatrist, occupational health specialist, mathematician, music director, economist, astronomer and clergy. Adapting may be the only way to avoid tumbling into unemployment as automation sweeps workers out of entire fields. The good news: Automation technology jobs are lucrative. Careers in advanced manufacturing automation range in salary from $40,000 to $60,000 for high-school grads with certification from a center like RAMTEC and from $50,000 to $70,000 for associate degree grads from junior colleges with similar training, said Paul Aiello, director of certified education training for Japanese robotics maker Fanuc. By contrast, the national median compensation for Americans with only an associate's degree is $41,496, while the median compensation for someone with only a high school diploma is $35,256, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Not all of this critical training comes in classrooms. Some workers manage to figure it out on their own. Joshua Wallace, 33, a robotics technician at Marlin Steel in Baltimore, taught himself how to improve some of the company’s robotics systems by watching videos on YouTube. “If I run into a problem it’s amazing — just jump online. I jump on a forum,” says Wallace, an Army veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq. “Surprisingly there’s a couple things I just learned that would have really helped out months ago and a three-minute video shows me how to break it down and do it. I’m like, 'Oh my, it’s so simple.'” Another way to keep the automation revolution from swallowing your job is to devise a role that turns the tables on tech. Mari Vance did. Vance, 25, of Las Vegas, recently had her hours cut almost in half, from full-time to part-time, working as a parking booth attendant when the hotel-casino where she worked installed an automated ticketing booth. Needing more work, she left her job and struck out on her own. She decided to design a role-playing game for computers, raising more than $15,000 through crowd fundraising site Kickstarter to create a visual novel video game called Dragon Date, using self-taught skills. “I have a theory that 20 years from now we’re all going to be technicians and all the service jobs are going to be automated,” she said. "In the long term, I feel like creative jobs and stuff like that are the jobs that are most immune to automation." She's got a point. The pace of advanced robotics installation is expected to go from 2% to 3% annual growth today to 10% growth within a decade, according to Boston Consulting Group. Educators need to adjust the pace at which they revise their own programs.© Provided by USA Today That’s what happened at RAMTEC, which stands for Robotic Advanced Manufacturing Technical Education Collaborative. Chuck Speelman, superintendent of the Tri-Rivers Career Center, said the organization realized several years ago after a series of candid conversations with local manufacturers that its robotics program was not teaching marketable skills or using up-to-date equipment. “They pretty much told us that what we were doing was a waste of time,” he said. “We had to change the paradigm.” In partnership with robotics companies, local manufacturers and educators, Tri-Rivers Career Center designed a system that is now being replicated throughout the state. High school students enrolled for free at RAMTEC continue earning their traditional diplomas while also collecting skills that local businesses such as global automaker Honda, which has plants in Ohio, and robotics refurbishing firm Robot Works are demanding. Companies are pitching in. For example, Fanuc donated software training programs and sold cutting-edge robotics systems to RAMTEC at a steep discount. The company already trains about 8,000 to 9,000 people annually through its own network of paid courses, but is running at 99% capacity. “We can’t keep up,” Aiello said. “The only way to put a dent in the demand is to partner with education.” Follow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.

The measure is part of the House GOP's corporate tax plan and would tax imports and exempt exports. "It will force consumers to pay as much as 20 percent more for the products they need. Gasoline is estimated to go up as much as 35 cents a gallon," said "Americans for Affordable Products" advisor Brian Dodge in an interview with "Power Lunch." "Common household goods, apparel, things that people count on every day, pajamas, will cost more and really just so a certain, select group of corporations can avoid paying taxes forever. We think that's bad policy," he added. Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images The coalition is made up of retailers like Wal-Mart, Macy's and Nike. However, other corporations in the U.S. are cheering the move. Names like General Electric, Boeing and Pfizer are members of the "American Made Coalition," which supports the border adjustment tax. Brian Reardon, an advisor to "American Made Coalition," told "Power Lunch" the Republicans' tax reform bill will keep jobs and money in the United States and the border adjustment tax is the "glue" that keeps the whole thing together. "The point is to ensure that when Americans are investing in the United States and creating products here that they are not at a tax disadvantage," he said. "The whole point … is to cut taxes so that we have more investment, more jobs, higher wages and at the end of the day, the consumer is going to be benefited, not hurt." In fact, the consumer will not be paying more for goods, he argued, pointing out that almost every country the U.S. competes with has this type of tax. "What we found when countries move to a border adjusted tax is that currencies adjust, markets work and the consumers are protected," said Reardon. However, Dodge called the notion that this type of border adjustment tax is common around the globe "grossly misleading." Instead of being a component of a corporate tax package, it is actually a proponent of a value-added tax — and that is different, he said. "The argument that currencies will adjust will be cold comfort and probably not fly with Middle American consumers who are concerned about having to pay more for products," he said. — CNBC's Gino Siniscalchi contributed to this report. show chapters AutoNation CEO: Tariffs and border tax talk causes 'headache' for auto industry    Friday, 3 Feb 2017 | 7:19 AM ET | 02:15 Michelle FoxProducer Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change WMT --- To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

U.S. President Donald Trump signed two executive orders on Jan. 25 to have the Department of Homeland Security begin planning, designing and building a "physical barrier" along the U.S.-Mexico border, identify undocumented immigrants, and remove those who have criminal records. (Xinhua/David de la Paz) by Huang Heng, ChenChen Shen EL CENTRO, the United States, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- "Trump's border wall? ... Well, I think it's just kidding," Brenda Gonzalez joked around with his customers. Originally from Mexico, Gonzalez is now a front desk manager at a Holiday Inn Express hotel in El Centro, California, 350 kilometers southeast to Los Angeles. "Tell Trump to offer me a job when he starts to build the wall," A Caucasian co-worker said to Gonzalez, while getting ready to start his shift at the front desk. Just a few months ago, this young man moved from Eastern Los Angeles to the largest city in the Imperial Valley, only 6.8 kilometers north of Calexico, a smaller town divided by fence with Mexicali, a Mexican city. This three-story Holiday Inn Express is a standing-out building in El Centro, owned by an immigrant from Eastern India. Ten years ago before this hotel first opened to business, local residents in El Centro thought motels were good enough for this city since only truck drivers would sleep over at town. But now, with the development of border trading, El Centro is growing and getting international, with chain restaurants and supermarkets. In Calexico, many of the shop owners are Korean. U.S. President Donald Trump signed two executive orders on Jan. 25 to have the Department of Homeland Security begin planning, designing and building a "physical barrier" along the U.S.-Mexico border, identify undocumented immigrants, and remove those who have criminal records. The cost of the wall to block off the nearly 3200 km-long border has been estimated to be anything from 8 to 25 billion U.S. dollars. However, for local residents living in the border cities, the wall is a ridiculous idea. "They won't build that wall, even if they did, nothing will change. There used to have those thin fences along the border, now they've replaced them with stronger metal fences. But people still come across the border to buy things or work. I do not think a wall will stop them." Vincent, a salesman at El Centro Walmart who only gave his first name, told Xinhua. The "ugly iron fences" he talked about are about 6 meters high and located in Calexico. Vincent, immigrated from Mexico years ago, believed that income difference was one of the major reasons for illegal immigrants to enter U.S. from Mexico. "They only make 4 dollars a day over there, but here, they make a few times more than that. One day here equals to one week there. Even if they get caught and sent back, they can come back later with Border Crossing Card," Vincent said. Border Crossing Card (BCC) allows Mexican citizens to visit the border areas of the United States when entering by land or sea directly from Mexico for less than 72 hours. "The only thing that will stop the flow of migrants is improved conditions in migrants' countries of origin: Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and other areas," Ev Meade, director of the University of San Diego's Trans-Border Institute told local KPBS radio last December. However, the reality was much more complicated than researchers' words. Vincent and all of the other local residents told Xinhua that, most of the Mexicans working in El Centro, including legal and illegal immigrants, did not really want to live in the U.S., they just want to make money in the U.S. and spend them in Mexico. Most of them go back to Mexico every week or even everyday. It is the U.S. employers that do not want them to leave. Not many locals can do or want to do the work that Mexicans are doing. Vincent said he had a part-time job repairing air-conditioners, only a few people in the agriculture-based Imperial Valley know how to do it. Statistics showed that "illegal immigrants" contributed a lot to American economy. A cross section of California leaders in business, education, law enforcement and religion testified at Supreme Court of the United States last year that a quarter of illegal immigrants in the U.S. lived in California, which accounted for 7 percent of the California population, meanwhile, over 34 percent of agriculture laborers, 22 percent of manufacturing laborers and 21 percent of construction workers were illegal immigrants. "The undocumented workforce alone made over 130 billion GDP for California last year, which was more than the entire respective GDPs of 19 other states." they said in a court brief. "If you build a 20-foot wall, they (illegal immigrants) will build a 21-foot ladder and they will try to get in," said Shawn Moran, vice-president of the National Border Patrol Council last November during an interview. Nevertheless, he also stated that fence or wall was, at least, a warning that would eliminate incentives for migrations to enter the country illegally. David FitzGerald, co-director of University of California San Diego's Center for Comparative Immigration Studies, pointed out that a tall wall would also make crossing border more dangerous, which may increase the death number. U.S. started to build the existing barrier since the 1990s. It is now over 700 miles (1,180 Kilometers) and about one-third of the total length of the land border. Since then, about 7,000 to 10,000 people died trying to enter the United States illegally. Immigration experts and human right groups also raised the question that if there was a wall where illegal immigrants could not pass, would they try to enter the US from the sea? If the answer is yes, then tragedies happening in Mediterranean now could happen here. "Why waste the money?" Leo Poldo, the manager at a local Italian restaurant called Marino, believed that Trump's wall plan was a "hoax" or a "political game." Trump is committed to renegotiating North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and if partners refuse conditions that give American workers a good deal then the president would give notice of the United States' intent to withdraw from NAFTA. For residents and people doing business in Imperial Valley, this threat, which could lead to a tax wall, bothered them more than the border wall. The border wall is more like a symbolic gesture. However, local businessmen said that the "tax wall" could bring down the local economy, and as a result more people would try to climb over that border wall. According to the Imperial County Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy, Mexico is California's highest ranking trading partner. Over 30 percent of the trading products come through the two land ports in Calexico. The total value of the trading products in 2013 was worth at 13.1 billion dollar. Border cities, such as El Centro and Calexico, thrived on international trading in last decade. Indian, Korean, and Chinese businessmen came to invest because of international trading. Moreover, Laborers living on the other side of the border had no strong willing to immigrate to the United States as they found a comfortable post in global economic chain. The Imperial Valley-Mexicali Binational Alliance held a seminar on this issue at CETYS University in Mexicali last Thursday. They reached conclusions that they had to talk to the U.S. And Mexican governments, to prepare for the worst time and to believe there would always be a way.    1 2 3 4 5 6 >>      1 2 3 4 5 6 >>   Xinhua Weibo Facebook Twitter Reddit Diigo Delicious Digg Linkedin MySpace Sina Weibo Kaixin Renren Q-zone Tencent Weibo Sohu Weibo NetEase Weibo Copyright © 2000 - 2016 XINHUANET.com All Rights Reserved.   Feature: Residents along U.S.-Mexico border shrug off Trump's wall plan                Xinhua Weibo Facebook Twitter Reddit Diigo Delicious Digg Linkedin MySpace Sina Weibo Kaixin Renren Q-zone Tencent Weibo Sohu Weibo NetEase Weibo   Source: Xinhua | 2017-02-07 06:07:25 | Editor: huaxia A migrant stands on a tree that he uses to sleep while he waits to cross the border, in the downtown of Tijuana, Mexico, on Feb. 6, 2017.

There used to have those thin fences along the border, now they've replaced them with stronger metal fences. But people still come across the border to buy things or work. I do not think a wall will stop them." Vincent, a salesman at El Centro Walmart who only gave his first name, told Xinhua. The "ugly iron fences" he talked about are about 6 meters high and located in Calexico. Vincent, immigrated from Mexico years ago, believed that income difference was one of the major reasons for illegal immigrants to enter U.S. from Mexico. "They only make 4 dollars a day over there, but here, they make a few times more than that. One day here equals to one week there. Even if they get caught and sent back, they can come back later with Border Crossing Card," Vincent said. Border Crossing Card (BCC) allows Mexican citizens to visit the border areas of the United States when entering by land or sea directly from Mexico for less than 72 hours. "The only thing that will stop the flow of migrants is improved conditions in migrants' countries of origin: Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and other areas," Ev Meade, director of the University of San Diego's Trans-Border Institute told local KPBS radio last December. However, the reality was much more complicated than researchers' words. Vincent and all of the other local residents told Xinhua that, most of the Mexicans working in El Centro, including legal and illegal immigrants, did not really want to live in the U.S., they just want to make money in the U.S. and spend them in Mexico. Most of them go back to Mexico every week or even everyday. It is the U.S. employers that do not want them to leave. Not many locals can do or want to do the work that Mexicans are doing. Vincent said he had a part-time job repairing air-conditioners, only a few people in the agriculture-based Imperial Valley know how to do it. Statistics showed that "illegal immigrants" contributed a lot to American economy. A cross section of California leaders in business, education, law enforcement and religion testified at Supreme Court of the United States last year that a quarter of illegal immigrants in the U.S. lived in California, which accounted for 7 percent of the California population, meanwhile, over 34 percent of agriculture laborers, 22 percent of manufacturing laborers and 21 percent of construction workers were illegal immigrants. "The undocumented workforce alone made over 130 billion GDP for California last year, which was more than the entire respective GDPs of 19 other states." they said in a court brief. "If you build a 20-foot wall, they (illegal immigrants) will build a 21-foot ladder and they will try to get in," said Shawn Moran, vice-president of the National Border Patrol Council last November during an interview. Nevertheless, he also stated that fence or wall was, at least, a warning that would eliminate incentives for migrations to enter the country illegally. David FitzGerald, co-director of University of California San Diego's Center for Comparative Immigration Studies, pointed out that a tall wall would also make crossing border more dangerous, which may increase the death number. U.S. started to build the existing barrier since the 1990s. It is now over 700 miles (1,180 Kilometers) and about one-third of the total length of the land border. Since then, about 7,000 to 10,000 people died trying to enter the United States illegally. Immigration experts and human right groups also raised the question that if there was a wall where illegal immigrants could not pass, would they try to enter the US from the sea? If the answer is yes, then tragedies happening in Mediterranean now could happen here. "Why waste the money?" Leo Poldo, the manager at a local Italian restaurant called Marino, believed that Trump's wall plan was a "hoax" or a "political game." Trump is committed to renegotiating North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and if partners refuse conditions that give American workers a good deal then the president would give notice of the United States' intent to withdraw from NAFTA. For residents and people doing business in Imperial Valley, this threat, which could lead to a tax wall, bothered them more than the border wall. The border wall is more like a symbolic gesture. However, local businessmen said that the "tax wall" could bring down the local economy, and as a result more people would try to climb over that border wall. According to the Imperial County Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy, Mexico is California's highest ranking trading partner. Over 30 percent of the trading products come through the two land ports in Calexico. The total value of the trading products in 2013 was worth at 13.1 billion dollar. Border cities, such as El Centro and Calexico, thrived on international trading in last decade. Indian, Korean, and Chinese businessmen came to invest because of international trading. Moreover, Laborers living on the other side of the border had no strong willing to immigrate to the United States as they found a comfortable post in global economic chain. The Imperial Valley-Mexicali Binational Alliance held a seminar on this issue at CETYS University in Mexicali last Thursday. They reached conclusions that they had to talk to the U.S. And Mexican governments, to prepare for the worst time and to believe there would always be a way.    1 2 3 4 5 6       1 2 3 4 5 6    分享 Xinhua Weibo Facebook Twitter Reddit Diigo Delicious Digg Linkedin MySpace Sina Weibo Kaixin Renren Q-zone Tencent Weibo Sohu Weibo NetEase Weibo People perform Shehuo in north China More passengers travel by train since Chunyun Blooming plum seen in Quancheng park in E China's Shandong Hainan farmers plow in field during spring plowing season Feature: Residents along U.S.-Mexico border shrug off Trump's wall plan Over 1,000 students take part in snowball fight at UBC in Vancouver Syrians gather at entrance of al-Ziabiyeh town British, Israeli PMs meet at 10 Downing Street in London Back to Top Close 010020070750000000000000011100001360363971

That’s exactly the problem the new director of the Nashua Soup Kitchen & Shelter is trying to tackle. Michael Reinke took over at the nonprofit last month. He’s hoping to find ways to get meals out to people in the area who can't get to the soup kitchen itself. He spoke with NHPR’s Morning Edition. Listen Listening... / 4:38 Broadcast version How do you think the city is doing as whole in addressing the issue of food insecurity? Comparatively speaking, we’ve been doing really well. One of the fantastic things about the Nashua Soup Kitchen & Shelter is we do have a food pantry that’s serving as many as 100 families on any given day, or 500 families a week. That’s huge. We’re really getting out there. And we have a great relationship with our local grocery stores, whether it’s Hannaford, Target, Trader Joe’s, Walmart, or Whole Foods, we have a truck that’s going around and getting the surplus food that they can’t sell, bringing it here, and we’re able to give it away to families that are food insecure. So we have a good supply chain, we have a good process, we’re getting people food. Our problem is really a logistic problem. How do we get food into communities where people don’t have access to reliable transportation? Maybe they have some mobility issues. If you look at the different neighborhoods in Nashua, whether that’s French Hill, Crown Hill, or the Tree Streets, you’ll find convenience stores just about every other block. But if you go into that convenience store, they’re looking for things that have long shelf life. So they’re selling chips, they’re selling candy, they’re selling beer, cigarettes, and lottery tickets. If you want a yogurt, you’re going to have to look far and wide to get that yogurt. You’ve talked about wanting to bring the organization’s services out to people around the community instead of having to get to the soup kitchen. What kinds of changes do you have in mind? I’m thinking about how we develop partnerships; maybe it’s with that convenience store, maybe it’s with a church in the area, maybe it’s with some place that’s always open, maybe a fire station. If we were to partner with our supply chain to bring fresh produce to this area maybe to do pre-packaged meals and put it in one of those slide-top refrigerator freezers that you got ice cream out of when you were a kid, and locate that in the fire station, in the church, in the convenience store. A family could then come along who can’t make it all the way to Shaw’s or Hannaford or Market Basket, but right here in my neighborhood, there’s a place where I can make sure I get fresh fruits and vegetables, where I can purchase a prepared meal that’s healthy, low in sodium, low in sugar, and tastes good for myself and my family. That’s how we can increase access to good, healthy food and make sure the health problems that are related to not having enough to eat, we can bring those costs down, and make sure kids are healthy when they go to school. Just about everybody believes that kids should have enough food to eat. And if we call come together, I believe there are resources in our community to be able to solve this problem. How do you strike a balance with the shop owner, who needs to make a profit, in order to do this and offer you the space? And how do you offer the logistics on your end when it comes to more time and staff? It’s going to have to be a partnership. We can’t just do it on our own. We’re going to need to develop partnerships with people like Meals on Wheels, or like E86, which is an organization that’s trying to make sure kids have food to get through the weekend. So we need partnerships with organizations like those with the food pantries around town. It’s going to be hard for any one organization, it’s going to be hard for the Nashua Soup Kitchen & Shelter to be able to solve the big, hairy, audacious problem by ourselves. But I believe if we partner with these organizations, partner with the mayor; I mean, just about everybody believes that kids should have enough food to eat. And if we call come together, I believe there are resources in our community to be able to solve this problem. Do you have a model that you’ve seen elsewhere in the country that you’d want to replicate here? There’s an organization down in North Carolina called Food Runners that actually has a mobile truck, like a food truck, that will go out to different neighborhoods and will say any kind in the neighborhood can come out and get a meal tonight and maybe even take a meal home for tomorrow night. So maybe we want to take that model and bring a food truck to French Hill, Crown Hill, the Tree Streets, and other areas where we know there are kids who don’t have enough to eat…and kids know they can go there and make sure they’re going to have a meal for that evening.  Tags:  Poverty TweetShareGoogle+Email View the discussion thread.

The 25-year-old is caught on surveillance wearing same sweatshirt and aviator hat each time. After being caught on surveillance on six different days shoplifting from Walmart, police finally caught Malcolm Tate on Sunday afternoon.  Each of the six days Tate was in the store, he apparently had on the same sweatshirt and unique aviator hat as pictured above (taken from surveillance video). The 25-year-old La Crosse man had walked out of the south side La Crosse store with nearly $2,700 worth of items six different days (Jan. 16, Jan. 20, Jan. 25, Jan. 26, Jan. 31 and Feb. 5).  When security noticed him around 1 p.m. Sunday, they told police "numerous employees in the store (were) following Malcolm at this point," the report said. The big ticket item was a home theater system valued at $148. On more than one occasion, he walked out with multiple bottles of Ciroc liquor valued at $31.97.   The most he left the store with at any one time was $775.26 on Jan. 26. Oddly enough, he was caught Sunday with just $67.46 worth of items - the least amount of any of the six days he shoplifted. Tate is in jail now for retail theft with his bond set at $800.

In what it calls a “thought exercise,” researcher Baum & Associates LLC estimates most automakers would need to raise vehicle prices by thousands of dollars -- more than $17,000 per vehicle in Jaguar Land Rover’s case, which imports all its vehicles -- to recoup higher costs incurred by a proposed border-adjusted tax. Ford, with significant domestic manufacturing, would need to mull the smallest price hike among major automakers, at about $282 per vehicle, followed by General Motors Co. at $995, according to the report. The estimates aim to show the relative impact of the tax plan on each automaker, according to Alan Baum, the founder of West Bloomfield, Michigan-based Baum & Associates. Carmakers are unlikely to raise prices by more than a few thousand dollars per car and would also likely have to foot some of the higher tax burden. “The plan results in a net cost for automakers,” Baum said. “Each company will then make its own decisions on pricing in order to best compete and maximize its profits.” Volvo and VW vehicle prices would have to rise by about $7,600 and $6,800 on average, according to estimates by Baum & Associates, which advises suppliers. President Donald Trump is said to be warming to the border-adjusted tax after initially viewing it as too complicated.

General Electric Co. and Boeing Co. are among U.S. manufacturers getting behind the idea, while Toyota Motor Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are among the corporate giants warning it will result in costlier products ranging from food and clothing to gasoline and auto parts. The Baum & Associates report accounts for imports of both finished vehicles and parts for domestic cars that are made overseas. The one automaker that may be able to keep prices steady would be Model S sedan maker Tesla. The proposed border tax may induce automakers to boost U.S. parts procurement and production from existing vehicle assembly plants, according to the report. Overseas automakers including Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.’s Subaru, Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Mazda Motor Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. may also consider expanding existing U.S. operations or building new capacity. Pure Importers “Pure importers” such as Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo parent company Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd., Mazda and Mitsubishi are most “in the crosshairs” of a border-tax regime due to their total reliance on imports for their U.S. sales, the report said. If the tax is put in place and the companies want to remain competitive, Jaguar Land Rover and Volvo "will need to ramp up U.S. parts sourcing and/or build plants here," the report said. "The border tax approach will otherwise consume all of their profits from selling vehicles here." Volvo is already moving in that direction, with plans to assemble S60 sedans at a new factory in South Carolina starting in late 2018. GM, Fiat Chrysler, Honda, Ford and Tesla each source more than 60% of their U.S. vehicle sales domestically, according to the report, with Ford at 82% and Tesla exclusively assembling vehicles in California. Hurting Neighbors If auto sales slow, the tax would create an incentive for automakers to keep U.S. plants running at the expense of those in Canada and Mexico. That could encourage Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to accelerate the conversion of factories in Michigan to build pickups there instead of Mexico, said Dan Luria, an economist at the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center in Ann Arbor and the lead author of the Baum & Associates report. Nissan Motor Co. might export more from Mexico to Latin American markets and less to the U.S. Volkswagen AG could build another U.S. assembly plant. Mazda and Mitsubishi, which rely entirely on imports to the U.S. market, may have to quit the U.S. market or pay other manufacturers to assemble their cars, Luria said. In its current form, the proposed border tax could lead to the production of up to 1 million additional vehicles in the U.S. and 50,000 more jobs at car and part assembly plants, Luria said. In a separate report out last week, Colin Langan, an analyst at UBS Securities LLC, said the proposed border tax could raise average prices in the U.S. by about 8%, or $2,500 per vehicle. That’s enough to reduce annual sales by about 2 million vehicles, he said. Langan said he expects a draft bill to be released in late February or early March. He pegged the chances of a border tax being enacted at less than 50%. The tax has a good chance of making its way through the House of Representatives but is “very unlikely” to pass in the Senate, Langan said.

In what it calls a “thought exercise,” researcher Baum & Associates LLC estimates most automakers would need to raise vehicle prices by thousands of dollars — more than $17,000 per vehicle in Jaguar Land Rover’s case, which imports all its vehicles — to recoup higher costs incurred by a proposed border-adjusted tax. Ford, with significant domestic manufacturing, would need to mull the smallest price hike among major automakers, at about $282 per vehicle, followed by General Motors Co. at $995, according to the report. The estimates aim to show the relative impact of the tax plan on each automaker, according to Alan Baum, the founder of West Bloomfield, Mich.-based Baum & Associates. Carmakers are unlikely to raise prices by more than a few thousand dollars per car and would also likely have to foot some of the higher tax burden. “The plan results in a net cost for automakers,” Baum said by phone. “Each company will then make its own decisions on pricing in order to best compete and maximize its profits.” Volvo and VW vehicle prices would have to rise by about $7,600 and $6,800 on average, according to estimates by Baum & Associates, which advises suppliers. President Donald Trump is said to be warming to the border-adjusted tax after initially viewing it as too complicated. The proposal to begin levying companies’ imports and domestic sales and make exports tax-exempt would completely overhaul the U.S. tax code. General Electric Co. and Boeing Co. are among U.S. manufacturers getting behind the idea, while Toyota Motor Corp. and Walmart Stores Inc. are among the corporate giants warning it will result in costlier products ranging from food and clothing to gasoline and auto parts. The Baum & Associates report accounts for imports of both finished vehicles and parts for domestic cars that are made overseas. The one automaker that may be able to keep prices steady would be Model S sedan maker Tesla. The proposed border tax may induce automakers to boost U.S. parts procurement and production from existing vehicle assembly plants, according to the report. Overseas automakers including Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.’s Subaru, Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Mazda Motor Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. may also consider expanding existing U.S. operations or building new capacity. “Pure importers” such as Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo parent company Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd., Mazda and Mitsubishi are most “in the crosshairs” of a border-tax regime due to their total reliance on imports for their U.S. sales, the report said. If the tax is put in place and the companies want to remain competitive, Jaguar Land Rover and Volvo “will need to ramp up U.S. parts sourcing and/or build plants here,” the report said. “The border tax approach will otherwise consume all of their profits from selling vehicles here.” Volvo is already moving in that direction, with plans to assemble S60 sedans at a new factory in South Carolina starting in late 2018. GM, Fiat Chrysler, Honda, Ford and Tesla each source more than 60 percent of their U.S. vehicle sales domestically, according to the report, with Ford at 82 percent and Tesla exclusively assembling vehicles in California. If auto sales slow, the tax would create an incentive for automakers to keep U.S. plants running at the expense of those in Canada and Mexico. That could encourage Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to accelerate the conversion of factories in Michigan to build pickups there instead of Mexico, said Dan Luria, an economist at the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center in Ann Arbor and the lead author of the Baum & Associates report. Nissan Motor Co. might export more from Mexico to Latin American markets and less to the U.S. Volkswagen AG could build another U.S. assembly plant. Mazda and Mitsubishi, which rely entirely on imports to the U.S. market, may have to quit the U.S. market or pay other manufacturers to assemble their cars, Luria said. In its current form, the proposed border tax could lead to the production of up to 1 million additional vehicles in the U.S. and 50,000 more jobs at car and part assembly plants, Luria said. In a separate report Wednesday, Colin Langan, an analyst at UBS Securities LLC, said the proposed border tax could raise average prices in the U.S. by about 8 percent, or $2,500 per vehicle. That’s enough to reduce annual sales by about 2 million vehicles, he said. Langan said he expects a draft bill to be released in late February or early March. He pegged the chances of a border tax being enacted at less than 50 percent. The tax has a good chance of making its way through the House of Representatives but is “very unlikely” to pass in the Senate, Langan said.

How are current, outdated models holding retailers and e-commerce brands back ? How can we fully embrace the omnichannel retail environment? Here are some challenges that businesses face in the current climate — along with some potential solutions. Outdated distribution models Many businesses are operating on an outdated distribution model. Traditional distribution models aren’t always the best way to go for ecommerce businesses; they need a flexible model with seamless technological integration. Integration is important – it helps manage inventories accurately, ensuring high operational efficiency. The big ecommerce giants are waging a war for logistical supremacy. Amazon has recently invested in freight shipping – a move which shows Amazon’s ongoing fulfilment ambitions, whereas and WalMart has just scrapped its Prime rival program, opting for free shipping for a large proportion of its customers instead. Big companies with competitive distribution channels are able to compete for customers with increasingly attractive delivery programs. Global markets vs. domestic markets China is where everyone is looking right now. Recently, Alibaba CEO Jack Ma had talks with Trump about expanding into America; Chinese Alibaba is effectively a giant marketplace, with little involvement in distribution and fulfilment. This hands-off model leads to problems with branding and customer experience — something more traditional retailers often perfect. Ecommerce vendors entering the US markets from countries like China and India will put pressure on national brands who struggle to meet consumer demand cost-effectively. Rather than compete on price, brands will have to learn how compete on customer experience and brand consideration. Lack of process efficiency Sales are trumped by the new omnichannel hero — efficiency. Efficiency is all about seamless operations and a commitment to data analysis. Adding value to customers is all about refining retail processes. It’s important to focus on efficiency over volume — scalable business over results right here and now. Inefficiencies lead to stagnation and frustration. In B2B, merchants often struggle let go of legacy systems like paper purchase orders; we need to embrace automation in order to hold onto valued customers.  Not investing in the future now Ecommerce is an exciting place full of emerging technology. Brands who want to stand the test of time need to be prepared for the technologies impacting customer experience, marketing, operations etc. Huge improvements in machine learning mean that live chat functions are now replacing the traditional call centers. Robots are entering distribution, and VR is making waves in the fashion industry. Amazon is even looking into the possibility of flying warehouses — the challenges of retail are being tackled by increasingly innovative solutions. The technology of today is tomorrow’s tool – companies need to invest in new ways of doing things in readiness for the paradigm shift. Mobile commerce had been on the radar for a number of years, but some companies were still surprised by mobile, leading to a colossal loss of revenue and market share. Ethical consumer choices In the hectic world of automation and mass production, consumers are going back to more local, authentic brands who offer them a more genuine experience. So how can brands speak to consumers on these terms, whilst also managing a business on a huge scale? The key is to make sure that process automation doesn’t also lead to brand autopilot. Mission statements, values, corporate social responsibility, and working with ethical suppliers are going to become increasingly important in the ideological battle for the consumer. PR in a digital world Open forums like social media are a hotbed for misunderstandings and PR nightmares. Brands need to be careful about the messages that they put out there as consumers will react badly to something they see as being in bad taste. (Recent #DeleteUber fiasco case in point.) To avoid PR disasters, brands need to get out of the lab more and test things out on real people. User research and studies will help align brand messaging with what people want. (And staying clear of politics is probably a good idea). Going digital is expensive Not going digital is perhaps even more expensive. Upgrading the backend and frontend of a store is a huge endeavor, but it’s an investment into your company’s future as a brand. Digital isn’t just about selling online — it’s about having more data, selling smarter, and operating a multichannel retail hub. Omnichannel and multichannel selling is becoming the norm; it’s how businesses stay competitive. (The much-publicized Shopify store/Amazon integration shows how platforms are encouraging the multichannel seller trend).

Get the latest news from The Morning Call on the Amazon Echo ALERT Breaking News Legendary retailer Albert Boscov dies at 87 News Breaking News Bullet buyer pleads guilty in "random" Easton-Allentown killing spree NORTHAMPTON COUNTY/CONTRIBUTED Robert Jourdain Robert Jourdain (NORTHAMPTON COUNTY/CONTRIBUTED) Laurie Mason SchroederContact ReporterOf The Morning Call Bullet buyer pleads guilty in "random" Easton-Allentown killing spree An Easton man pleaded guilty Monday in Lehigh County Court to buying the bullets that his "psychopathic" friend used to murder three people during a one-night, random killing spree in 2015 in Allentown and Easton. As part of a plea deal, Robert A. Jourdain, 22, will serve at least 12 and up to 40 years for conspiracy to commit third-degree murder. Judge James T. Anthony will decide the maximum prison term when Jourdain is sentenced March 27. Jourdain did not testify during the plea hearing, but asked the judge numerous legal questions. First Assistant District Attorney Steven Luksa said the victims' families agreed with the plea deal. "There is a recognition that Mr. Jourdain is taking responsibility for his actions," Luksa said. The killings took place in the pre-dawn hours of July 5, 2015. Jourdain was riding in a car with Kareem Mitchell, 24, of Newark, N.J., and Todd West, 24, of Elizabeth, N.J. Jourdain admitted that he bought a box of bullets at the Walmart in Lower Nazareth Township for West, who paid for and requested the ammunition. Friends remember Kory Ketrow, Easton homicide victim Kory Ketrow lived with the Bader family for three years prior to his death on sunday. The family and friends talk about him fondly.

See more videos Just after 3 a.m., West fatally shot Kory Ketrow, 22, of Easton, who was walking just steps away from his Lehigh Street home. West, who pleaded guilty in October to three counts of first-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison, told detectives that he killed Ketrow because the victim looked "tired." Moments later, West shot at a car at Third and Spring Garden streets in Easton, narrowly missing a man and woman inside. Police say the trio then drove on Route 22 to Allentown, where West shot Trevor Gray, 22, and Francine Ramos, 32, who were in a car at Sixth and Greenleaf streets. Ramos, the driver, was found dead in the vehicle. Gray, who tried to scramble over the hood to escape the bullets, died in the street.

Authorities released no new details Monday about the investigation into the shooting death of an Easton man early Sunday in the West Ward. Easton police said Kory Ketrow, 22, was shot several times about 3:15 a.m. near his home on the 1100 block of Lehigh Street. Ketrow was rushed to a hospital,... (Matt Coughlin) Evidence at that scene led police to the car the trio was using, which police say belonged to Mitchell's mother. Mitchell, who is accused of driving West to the killing scenes, is scheduled to stand trial later this year. West and Jourdain were arrested the next day, after allegedly robbing several people at knife point in Allentown. Mitchell turned himself in a few days later. Jourdain's attorney, Christopher M. Shipman, said his client did not know West was planning to kill, but acknowledges that he provided the ammunition that West used to take three lives. "He gave him the bullets, despite the fact that Todd West was mentally unstable and could best be described as psychopathic," Shipman said. Jourdain has been held in the Lehigh County Jail without bail since his arrest and will remain there while awaiting sentencing. lmason@mcall.com Twitter @LehighCourts 610-820-6506 Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, The Morning Call Homicide DA to seek death penalty against Todd West, alleged gunman in Allentown, Easton killings Breaking Popular Obits Biz Cycle Sports Video/Photos Classifieds Go Guide App 30°

Country pop singer Kelsea Ballerini, nominated this year for a Best New Artist Grammy, and country singer-songwriter, Brett Young, will also perform. The “You Look Good” world tour, presented by NABISCO, is comprised of 65 shows in six countries, according to a press release from the AMP. The group decided to tour together after taking last year to pursue solo projects, according to the AMP. “We knew after the time off that we wanted to get back out on the road in a big way,” group member Charles Kelley said in the press release. “We couldn’t be more ready to get back out there with the fans and hopefully make a few new ones too.” Lady Antebellum’s “You Look Good” single is in a way a departure musically from its previous songs, the group says. “We’ve always loved experimenting with different instruments and sounds in the studio, but we’ve never used horns before,” group member Dave Haywood said in the press release. “The energy they brought to this song is really fun and was validation for all three of us that it had to be our first single back.” The single is part of Lady Antebellum’s “Heart Break” album, which will be released on June 9. “We knew right away that we had to name this album after a track that is a play on the word ‘heartbreak,’” group member Hillary Scott said the press release. ”It’s all about those personal growths everyone goes through, and it was liberating to get back in the studio with Charles and Dave to intertwine those feelings into the recording process. … I feel like we’ve reemerged stronger than ever and I can’t wait to share more music.” Tickets for Lady Antebellum, Kelsea Ballerini and Brett Young will go on sale Feb. 10 at 10 a.m. Ticket prices range from $36 to $69.50 plus fees. On Aug. 5, doors will open at 6 p.m. and music will start at 7:30 pm. Tickets can be purchased in person at the Walton Arts Center box office in Fayetteville, by calling 479-443-5600 or by visiting www.amptickets.com. The Walmart AMP box office in Rogers is closed, according to the release. The performance is part of the AMP’s 2017 Cox Concert Series, which debuts April 22 with Blink-182. Train is set to play May 22, and Third Eye Blind is scheduled for July 12. Steve Miller Band with Peter Frampton will play July 18, and Tedeschi Trucks Band with the Wood Brothers and Hot Tuna will play July 25.   Comments comments Previous post DOT report highlights state of transportation industry Next post Walton Foundation donates $750K toward economic development in Delta Newsletter Sign up to get latest from TB&P in your inbox!

By Daniele Alcinii February 6, 2017 London-based sales house Dogwoof has acquired the UK distribution and international sales rights to Dan Sickles and Antonio Santini’s Sundance-winning doc Dina. Produced by Moxie Pictures and El Peligro, Dina captures the cadences and candid conversations of a relationship that re-examines the notion of love. The 101-minute doc charts the unconventional love story of Philadelphia-based Dina, an eccentric 49-year-old suburban woman, and her fiancée Scott, an early-morning Walmart greeter, as they move in together ahead of their impending wedding. The film was most recently awarded with the U.S. Documentary Grand Jury Prize at this year’s Sundance Film Festival. Dogwoof plans to introduce the film to foreign buyers at this year’s Berlinale and will also release the film later this year in the UK. The deal was negotiated by Dogwoof’s head of distribution Oli Harbottle with Submarine’s David Koh and Josh Braun on behalf of the filmmakers. Exec producers on the film include Impact Partners’ Dan Cogan and Jenny Raskin; Moxie’s Danny Levinson and Robert Fernandez; and Killer Pictures’ Stephanie Choate and Christine Vachon. Earlier this month, U.S. distributor The Orchard acquired the North American distribution rights to the film. “In Dina, Dan and Antonio have created a stunningly cinematic film, which lovingly charts the evolution of the innocent and candid romance of its central characters,” said Harbottle in a statement. “With the look and feel of a classic U.S. indie movie, it is a worthy winner of the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance and is destined to become a favorite with audiences everywhere.” TAGS:Antonio Santini, Dan Sickles, Dina, Dogwoof Top Stories Documentary Series explores Manson murders through grandson’s eyes By Meagan Kashty February 10, 2017 Documentary A+E, Snapchat team up on original content By Selina Chignall February 10, 2017 Documentary Emmerson, Hungate step down from Warner Bros.

Police accused Travis Bailey Littles, 34, and Antonio Anthony Watts, 28, of having five or more counterfeit items and with conspiracy to get property by false pretenses. Littles was also charged with trying to get Visa gift cards from a Dollar General by using phony $20s. Police said he had 55 of them when arrested. Watts was charged with successfully getting clothing, cheese and other items from Walmart and with having 31 phony $20s when the two were arrested in the 300 block of Brooks Street shortly before noon. Littles’ address was listed in an arrest order as 675 Classon Ave. in Brooklyn, but he told booking officers at the Wake County Detention Center that he lives at 418 Jones Dairy Road, just outside Wake Forest. Tax records show that house is owned by a woman who lives in Brooklyn. Watson lives at 80 E. 93rd St. in Brooklyn. A magistrate set bail at $150,000 for each man.

It was created to provide people with affordable transit between Madoc Township, Marmora and Lake, Madoc Village, Tweed, Stirling/Rawdon and Belleville. In July of 2014, the Network purchased a new 17-seat bus with a lift and seating for two handicapped passengers. One bus does the Marmora Stirling route the other does the Tweed, Thomasburg route to Belleville and back twice a day. The stops in Belleville include Loyalist College, the hospital and Walmart. For route, schedule and cost information go to: http://www.chsninc.ca/transit Central Hastings News By Sue Dickens The wheels on the bus go round and round. round and round, round and round. The wheels on the bus go round and round, all through the town! Written by Verna Hills, 1939 Madoc — Students from the JK and SK class at Madoc Public School, sang the popular children’s folksong “The Wheels on the Bus” to help celebrate the announced purchase of a new $84,000 17-seat bus for the Central Hastings Public Transit system. The ribbon cutting ceremony was held Feb. 2 at the offices of the Central Hastings Support Network (CHSN) which provides the service. Tony Long, chair of the Central Hastings Transit Partners group, and vice chair of the CHSN board, who led the official ceremony commented, “This is a very much needed service.” Sally Gale, executive director of the Network was there with board members and drivers. “It’s taken a full year of budgeting and working with the financials to allow this to happen,” she commented. Last fall Gale talked about meeting with MPP Jeff Leal in Peterborough, (minister responsible for small business and minister of agriculture, food and rural affairs) to ask for funding. “One of our best kept secrets is our transit,” she said, hoping then that their plans to acquire a new larger bus would become a reality. “With a 21 per cent increase in ridership over the past two years, it was essential to make the move to replace the eight-passenger van with more than 450,000 km on the clock,” she said. Ridership figures show that 5,000 passengers now use the service annually. Marmora and Lake Deputy Mayor Linda Bracken, also on hand for the ribbon cutting, said, “I know all the municipalities thank each and every one of you for all the hard work you do on your board.” It is that coming together of five municipalities that has made the transit system possible. “Without the agreement of all five municipalities; Stirling Rawdon, Marmora and Lake, Tweed, Madoc Township and Centre Hastings, we would not be able to apply for the gas tax,” explained Gale. “Marmora and Lake have kindly and generously agreed to be the sponsor for the transit so they apply on our behalf for that tax.” The annual budget to operate the transit system is $150,000 and that covers insurance, maintenance, gas and drivers. “Our liability insurance has virtually doubled because we’re taking on more passengers now,” noted Gale. “I am very excited to see our donors and funders stepping up to the plate to help us meet the needs of the people of Central Hastings as far as transportation is concerned,” she concluded. | (0) Comment Join The Conversation Sign Up Login Latest Local News News Marmora SnoFest dog sledding races cancelled Snapshot News QW man faces murder 'counseling' charge Snapshot News Under capacity schools pose financial problem for board, audience at public meeting hears Snapshot News More arrests in Roll Up Rim cup caper Snapshot The Hot List: Top 10 cottage rental locations in Ontario Sponsored content Most Read SEE MORE Opening 'Love Letters' Friday night in Actinolite Central Hastings OPP warns of financial scam, computer virus Belleville's a growing city, Canadian census and U-Haul report show Marmora SnoFest dog sledding races cancelled Quinte West launches active transportation plan, requests community’s input In Your Neighbourhood Today Get paid for completing energy-saving retrofits in your home You may have home renovations low on your list of spending priorities, partly due to prohibitive...

(AP) — Investigators say a customer who fatally shot a man suspected of stealing diapers from a Wal-Mart store in Florida also injured a second person. Orange County Sheriff’s Capt. Angelo Nieves tells local news outlets that three men left the store in Orlando with stolen items Saturday and were loading the merchandise into a vehicle when a store employee approached them. An armed customer heard the commotion and came to the employee’s aid. Connolly calls for 3.2 percent pay raise for feds in 2018 Nieves says the customer thought 19-year-old Arthur Adams was going for a gun and fired his weapon. Initially deputies thought the customer only shot Adams but later learned a juvenile girl sitting in the vehicle was hit in the leg. She fled the scene and went to a hospital hours later. A third suspect is still being sought.

Read the full chapter on upholding good governance here. The Trump policy towards Africa will not be clear for several months at least, if we are to judge by the time it has taken past administrations to put their teams in place and articulate their objectives. While it is apparent that the president-elect has had very little contact with the continent, the same was true for Presidents Clinton and Bush. Similarly, President Obama—who later emerged as a champion of African-U.S. private sector investment—did not develop a strategy for the continent until the end of his first term. So, what might lay ahead for Africa? One of the most interesting initiatives to appear in the transition is the formation of Trump’s President’s Strategic and Policy Forum. The purpose of this group is to provide the president with private sector expertise on creating jobs and accelerating economic growth. Author Witney Schneidman Nonresident Fellow - Global Economy and Development, Africa Growth Initiative Twitter WitneySchneid The group is made up of 16 CEOs and, notably, many lead companies that are active in Africa. They include: Blackstone, General Motors, Wal-Mart, Boeing, IBM, Ernst & Young, and GE. The forum’s first meeting is planned for February at the White House. Clearly, the focus of the forum will be on the private sector’s role in rebuilding America’s infrastructure, which Trump announced as a priority on election night. This goal has great relevance and potential for Africa. For instance, one proposal would be to create an economic subcommittee of the forum to look at infrastructure opportunities for American companies in Africa that would utilize American-made components. Enhancing the U.S. role in addressing Africa’s infrastructure deficit with American machinery and other products would increase U.S. exports to the region. In 2015, the export of U.S. goods to Africa was valued at $18 billion, which supports an estimated 121,000 jobs in the U.S., according to the Commerce Department. A strategy that incentivizes American companies in such a way that it increases U.S. exports and jobs to reduce Africa’s infrastructure deficit would contribute to a legacy in Africa for President-elect Trump on par with his predecessors, if not more so. To facilitate its work, an African subcommittee of the forum could coordinate its work with the President’s Advisory Committee on Doing Business in Africa (PAC-DBIA), which reports to the president through the secretary of commerce. Over the course of three meetings, the PAC-DBIA has made a number of recommendations related to enhancing the role of the United States in developing Africa’s infrastructure. These recommendations include creating a U.S.-Africa Infrastructure Center and prioritizing U.S. companies and products in building out Africa’s transportation, energy, and health infrastructure. The last three presidents have left positive legacies related to Africa. This includes President Clinton’s signing into law of the African Growth and Opportunity Act; President Bush’s support for the President’s Emergency Program for AIDS Relief and the Millennium Challenge Corporation; and Power Africa, the Young African Leaders Initiative, and the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit of the Obama administration. A strategy that incentivizes American companies in such a way that it increases U.S. exports and jobs to reduce Africa’s infrastructure deficit would contribute to a legacy in Africa for President-elect Trump on par with his predecessors, if not more so. To make this happen, African leaders should engage the Trump administration actively and with an open mind. They should also endeavor to point out ways in which a substantial infrastructure program could benefit Americans as much it would those on the African continent.

View FAQ or Contact Us close [x] Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Share LinkedIn Email (Photograph by Liam Mogan, Food Styling by Andrew Bullis) The complex where we lived until recently had only a single chute for waste. Several times a week, I would step into a pair of chewed up sneakers and make the 20-metre stroll to toss our garbage. As a family, we were diligent recyclers—cutting down boxes and bundling newspapers, which we still read—but we paid little attention to our kitchen waste. Bags filled with wrappers and plastic but also egg shells, old peppers and leftovers, were routinely pushed past the trap door and quickly forgotten. When we moved to a new home earlier this year, our waste became harder to ignore. It now sits right outside our back door, laid bare to see. Thinking about it makes my stomach churn. Not so much the moist slop of decaying food scraps, but the value and volume of the food we carelessly throw away. During one particularly bad stretch, my family threw out most of a carton of blueberries, a half rack of ribs, rice, baked potatoes and an unopened Costco-sized tray of chicken that had developed a pungent odor in our fridge when life interrupted our meal plans. That didn’t account for leftover scraps from our plates or the untouched dinner snubbed by an occasionally picky toddler who demanded cereal instead of roast chicken. I tallied it up: We tossed an estimated $40 worth of food in a week or so. Reading the wilting leaves in our green bin, I saw an opportunity to reduce our waste and lower our grocery bill. I’m the resident shopper and chef in the family, so it’s mostly down to me. During weekly runs to the grocery store, I rarely bother with a list. We mostly pick up the same items each week: chicken, a couple tins of diced tomatoes, broccoli, asparagus, green beans. Our basket is consistent to the point where I can often guess the total before it gets rung through—typically $115 a week. That adds up to about $6,000 a year, for our family of four. Apart from the sameness of our meals, this isn’t something we viewed a problem, until we tracked our waste and realized it was. In retrospect there have been too many occasions when the depths of our fridge decayed into a wasteland of half-used onions, liquefied cucumbers, petrified lemons and colourful penicillin colonies hiding half-eaten cheeses—all orphan ingredients from slapdash meals dreamed up on the fly. We are not alone. At the University of Guelph, assistant professor Kate Parizeau was part of a research team that conducted an audit of residential food waste in the summer of 2014. They cracked open green bins to uncover the rotten truth about how much food is being tossed: The average family generated 4.5 kg of food waste every week. Of that, roughly 2.3 kg were avoidable, while another 0.5 kg were considered to be possibly avoidable. “We were picking up green bins that had been outside for between one and seven days and some of the food still looked pretty edible,” she says. What’s equally shocking is the cost. According to research by Ralph Martin, the Loblaw Chair in Sustainable Food Production at the University of Guelph, that 4.5 kg of food is equal to about $28 every week or $1,465 a year. Given the average Canadian family of four spends roughly $140 a week on food that means about 20% of our grocery bills end up in the bin. It’s as much as many families spend annually on gas. “People are buying too much and not portioning well,” says Parizeau. “It adds up.” Of course, inflation and the weakening loonie have also conspired to drive up supermarket bills, as have unusual price fluctuations, such as the one we saw earlier this year when the price of a single head of cauliflower jetted to $8 a head. By the end of 2016, food price increases are projected to outstrip the general inflation rate, which is alarming given how much of monthly spending is earmarked for food. The University of Guelph’s Food Institute expects the average household will spend $8,631 yearly on food, including $2,416 on restaurants. That’s up $345 from 2015, which was up $325 from 2014. That means the average family is spending $700 more on food than they were two years ago. Meats and vegetables are leading the way, up 4% and 9% respectively, and are projected to rise another 2.5% to 4.5% this year. So even if you avoid exorbitant cauliflowers (as I do), it won’t make you less immune to bill creep. The avg household will spend $8,631 on food in 2016, up $700 since 2014 Tweet This That is not welcome news. According to a recent poll by Vancouver-based Angus Reid Institute, 57% of Canadians say it’s becoming more of a challenge to put food on the table. Moreover, Canadians are cutting back in any way they can. Almost three out of four Canadians say they’ve switched to lower-priced house brands, while 61% have cut back on meat and 42% have cut back on fruits and vegetables. But do you really have to sacrifice nutrition or the foods you enjoy to save a buck? I consulted a number of chefs, nutritionists and food experts and, over the course of six weeks, I experimented with the best advice they had to offer. My goal: to cut my $6,000 annual grocery bill by $1,500 or 25%, by reducing waste and shopping smarter. I refused to make any nutritional sacrifices whatsoever, and insisted on continuing to plate meals my family loves eating (because I don’t know about you but I’m not about to adopt a new habit if I don’t enjoy it). I found that with a bit of planning, not only can my family eat great for less, we can eat even better. 1. Run your kitchen like a restaurant While the average family wastes food like no tomorrow, a 2010 Canadian study found that well-run restaurants waste no more than 5%. I wanted to know what they are doing that I am not and set out to find someone who could appreciate the need to keep costs in check but still cook a kickass meal. My search led me to Suzanne Barr, the driving force behind Saturday Dinette, a modern 35-seat restaurant in Toronto’s trendy South Riverdale neighbourhood. For Barr, watching costs comes second only to the care she puts into prepping brunch favourites like mushroom stout ragu on toast with lavender ricotta. “Being a true mom-and-pop restaurant, we do everything ourselves here and we watch every penny that goes in and out,” she says from behind the counter. When Barr noticed that many plates were returning with an untouched buckwheat pancake during her highly touted weekend brunch service, she quickly dropped the serving size from three to two. “It’s almost like food coming out of our mouths and money coming out of our pockets,” she says of the uneaten food that ends up in the dish pit. Adjusting portion sizes is something that works as well at home as it does at the restaurant. Author and registered dietician Cara Rosenbloom suggests that parents serve their kids smaller portions, offering seconds if they’re still hungry. After all, few people would pack up food that’s been picked over by a toddler, but with the right portioning, leftovers can be saved for another day. Here’s another reason way restaurants keep their waste to a minimum: They use everything. “That’s how we really keep costs down, we use every part of the vegetable,” says Amanda Cohen, the Ottawa-born chef behind Dirt Candy, hailed by the New York Times as one of the most influential vegetarian restaurants in the United States. “We find uses for them even if they are going bad; we will pickle them or dehydrate them.” Barr operates the same way. When she gets her order of fennel she mixes it into her slaw, uses the fronds for fennel butter and incorporates the rest into three different cooking stocks she makes. “It’s about getting the most out of every single thing here,” she says. And if the foods can’t be incorporated on the plate right away, you still have options that don’t require dusting off your grandparent’s canning equipment. “Take a loaf of bread and turn it into bread crumbs,” suggests Barr. “Challenge yourself to make something you’ve never made before.” 2. Shop more often for less stuff Adjusting portion sizes and getting creative can help you use up stray ingredients, but it only gets you so far. Overbuying is the elephant in the refrigerator. This is a particular problem in North America where many of us take pride in our ability to snap up perceived deals by buying in bulk. All those four-litre buckets of ketchup and pickles, intended to save money, more often end up creating more waste. A 2010 University of Arizona study looked at shoppers who stocked up on food at low-priced retailers like Walmart and Costco and found that they rarely consider the cost of what they end up discarding. In one case a participant who bought salad greens at Costco for “$3.50 or something” ended up discarding a large portion, but still felt it was a better deal than buying a more reasonably-sized container of greens for $2.50. “The modern American tendency to shop infrequently is at odds with basic human abilities to predict future food consumption needs,” was the author’s conclusion. It comes down to knowing what you are able to consume, says Sylvain Charlebois, professor of business and economics at the University of Guelph. “We are bad inventory managers at home,” he says. “We live fast-paced lives and at times the food we buy and what happens at home gets the best of us.” Buying perishables in bulk makes the least sense since they’re the first things that get tossed when we realize we’re too tired to cook one night. But the issue goes beyond stockpiling foods that go off. A 2000 report out of the University of Illinois, aptly titled “Cabinet Castaways,” warned of the risk of products bought for a specific recipe or occasion that never arose. It suggests that as much as 15% of our non-perishable goods are never used and eventually get tossed after gathering dust in our pantries. Likewise, North Americans have grown accustomed to filling their fridges with so much stuff we struggle to find room for milk. I’m guilty of this. My freezer is packed with bags of ice-encrusted meats, some of which have been with us since we left the condo. Without even seeing my freezer, this frustrates Chef Barr. “What’s in there? Things in your freezer shouldn’t be there more than a month. If it’s there after a month are you really ever going to eat it?” Her rule: Open your freezer as often as you open your fridge and make sure things are coming out as often as they’re going in. Otherwise, “yeah, that freezer is going to continue to grow and grow.” The simplest way to fight the compulsion to stockpile food: Shop more often and for less stuff. Dirt Candy’s Amanda Cohen is a proponent of this idea. Until recently, Cohen operated out of an 18-seat restaurant where keeping costs in check was a matter of survival. “We bought our vegetables every single day. We never had leftovers at the end of the night. We always started fresh,” she says. “It really meant we were using what we were buying and that stuck with us at the new place.” “It’s better to shop 2x a week than shop once & have a whole fridge of food go bad”Tweet This She says that if you can’t predict more than a few days in advance, then chances are you’re buying food you have no intention of eating. “It’s better to shop twice a week than to shop once and have a whole fridge of food go bad,” says Cohen. “It’s OK to run out.” This sounded like a logistical nightmare to me. On my first attempt, I went halfway: We did our weekly shopping trip but only bought what we needed to get us through the weekend, and then replenished throughout the week. If we got stuck, I knew we had some meat in the freezer we could chip out from under the ice. To my surprise, the bill rang up to a mere $40. The additional mid-week trip, for fresh vegetables, only added another $10 or so. In terms of food costs we saved $65 off our weekly bill—granted I managed to avoid meat purchases, but that would only add $30 or so for the week, which still put us 20% below our typical bill. If figured that if we did this once or more a month, we’d shave nearly $1,000 a year from our supermarket spending. 3. Don’t sweat the seasonal stuff By the same token don’t feel compelled to spend extra on organic carrots. Amanda Cohen’s whole business is built on turning common vegetables into high art and she doesn’t. She happily admits she’s seasonal agnostic and has never gone out of the way to buy top-of-the-line fruits and vegetables. She prefers to work with the same produce most of us have in our home kitchens. Cohen feels consumers get too caught up in the notion of buying locally and in-season. While Cohen says it’s great to support local farmers, the reality is most of our food comes from other parts of the globe. “Oranges are always out of season in Canada,” she offers by way of an example, adding that there’s nothing wrong with that.  In a widely read New York Times column, she noted how little most grocery stores stock in the way of local foods. “The fact is, we live in a post-seasonal world,” she wrote. “The vast majority of our fruits and vegetables comes to us on trucks and planes from faraway farms, and everything is always in season somewhere. Make your peace with it.” Still I instinctively thought certain foods would be cheapest during the months they’re grown in abundance. After all, it’s when they are freshest and most plentiful. But a detailed study of the Canadian consumer price index, which measures changes in the prices Canadians experience for a fixed basket of goods, revealed otherwise. Going back over 20 years of data, I noticed some interesting patterns emerge. Citrus is cheapest during the first three months of the year, while apples are most expensive during August and September, just when they’re coming into season in Ontario. According to Kelly Ciceran, general manager with Ontario Apple Growers, that’s because demand actually outstrips supply during those months. The cheapest apples arrive in stores in January. “That’s when there are lots of promotions, both from us and our competition,” says Ciceran. “We typically sell more bagged apples at this time which can be less expensive than loose apples.” Food myth: produce is cheaper when it’s in-season. Apples are most expensive Aug. to Sept.Tweet This Meanwhile, you can save by buying oddly shaped fruit and vegetables at any time. Loblaws latched onto this idea last year when it launched its Naturally Imperfect line of produce, selling undersized, discoloured or misshaped onions, apples, carrots and mushrooms for up to 30% less than their runway-ready counterparts. Nutritionally and taste-wise there is no difference. 4. Work the freezer aisle You’ve probably heard the old adage that you should shop the periphery of the store, where you find most of the fresh and perishable products, and skip the middle aisles. Nutritionist after nutritionist I spoke with urged me to take a turn down the freezer aisle, for my wallet and my health. “There are studies that show these products are just as fresh,” says Rosenbloom. In some ways, they’re even better. “Often the frozen ones have a higher nutrient content,” she explains. Think about how most produce gets to the store in the first place. It’s had a long journey and nutrients and vitamins like vitamin C break down over time. A bunch of fresh spinach could have spent a week or more in transit. Frozen produce is typically flash frozen within six to 12 hours of being picked when it’s at its peak freshness, she says. Following Rosenberg’s advice, I picked up a two-kg bag of frozen broccoli from Costco for $10. A bit of math suggested it contained about 20 servings. And while I wondered what Chef Barr would say, I felt slightly better when, a few days later, I noticed a single stock of limp broccoli, enough for two servings, selling for $2 at my local supermarket. In this case, frozen offered a significant savings—$10 in this scenario—over buying fresh. Using the freezer aisle as a hedge when fresh produce costs are high, or to have on hand during weeks when you don’t know if you’ll have time to cook, will cut my food waste and ultimately help lower my grocery bill. But beware that not every frozen food item is always a deal. Breaking out the calculator, I learned that strawberries are almost always a better deal fresh. It’s only after they top $4.99 per pound that it pays to buy frozen. I’m confident that I made a wise decision with my bag of broccoli—so long as I don’t forget it’s there. It shouldn’t be a problem: It takes up half the space in my freezer. 5. Ignore best before dates Here’s an all too common ritual: You reach into your fridge and grab a yogurt, only to notice it was “best before” yesterday. So you toss it out. At the University of Guelph, associate professor Mike von Massow argues that our fixation on these dates is misplaced. The dates printed on packages are really “sell-by” dates, when the food is at peak freshness, he explains. The food is still good, just not ideal for sale. It really comes down to a judgment call, he says, noting we’re often too quick to dispose of leftovers. “If it’s cooked properly,” he says, “you are starting with a clean slate.” If it smells fine, probably is fine.  I find there’s a bit of a “yuck” factor with this advice. I still have nightmares of a teenage encounter with a commercial-sized vat of OJ well past its expiration date. As such, I view expiration dates the same way I’d approach a bomb ticking down: I don’t want them to be around when they go off. For the paranoid like me, sites like Stilltasty.com can tell you everything from how long you can keep that open jar of salsa (one month) and how long you can freeze maple syrup (indefinitely) to how long that tub of yogurt should last past its sell-by date (seven to 10 days, apparently). The key is to manage your stock wisely. That means employing proper food storage and resisting the urge to crack open a fresh tub of sour cream just because the other one has already been open a few days. 6. Cut the red meat (It’s too pricey anyway) The freezer aisle isn’t the only one consumers should hit; don’t forget the candy aisle, says Rosenbloom. Not because she wants to see consumers load up on jujubes, but because that’s where many grocers typically stock pulses—beans, lentils and seeds—which can be used to help bulk up dishes so you can use less meat. Beef in particular is one of the grocery groups that has risen the most in recent years—with the price of a sirloin steak rising by more than 15% since 2014, according to Statistics Canada. About two cups of cooked red lentils is all I can handle. Following Rosenbloom’s advice, I added a handful to a batch of sloppy joes, as well as to a meatloaf, and still had plenty of the cooked lentils leftover. I was pleased to see it stretched our ground beef by adding at least two extra meals, even if the recipe had room for improvement. (My sloppy joes look more like chili.) Each of those meals would have cost $1.73 per person in meat alone, but bulking up with lentils dropped the protein cost to $1.03—a 40% savings. I don’t think I could keep all of our meal prices down this much, but if I did we would save $700 a year. Not a bad return for a $6 bag of lentils. Tofu is another food that can put a serious dent into your grocery bill, and a great substitute for recipes that call for boneless chicken breast. “For $2.99 you can feed a family of four,” says Rosenbloom. Up for the challenge I decided to take her advice a step further by combining it with another piece of advice Barr gave me when I visited her at the diner. Barr’s tip? Whether it’s meat or vegetable, utilize an ingredient in a number of ways to get the most out of it. For instance, she has beets on her menu three times. “People would never guess that it’s used in so many dishes.” At home that meant adding bean curd to our menu for two straight days. As someone who eats meat three times a day, a meal of tofu sounded about as enticing as a plate of boiled brussels sprouts to a teen. But following some advice I cubed up some extra-firm tofu and tossed it into some caramelized butter in a sizzling frying pan. It took only minutes to throw together a simple stir fry, but it was surprisingly good and filling. A similar meal using chicken would have cost upwards of $9 in meat costs alone; this cost less than $3, and there was more than enough left over for lunch. Tofu Thursdays is now a meal we look forward to, and we used the leftover protein for a brown fried rice experiment the next day which resulted in another successful side dish. Meats add a lot of weight to a grocery bill. Even if you don’t want to explore vegetarian options, there are other things you can do to lower this portion of your bill. Consider buying bone-in, skin-on chicken, suggests Zannat Reza, a registered dietician and founder of the food consultancy Thrive360. You can always de-bone it at home or cook it as is, she says. With boneless, you’re paying extra for convenience. For similar reasons Reza suggests skipping lean or extra lean beef and draining the fat. “Sometimes it can be half the price,” she says. “Obviously if you are making a recipe where you can’t drain off the excess grease then go for the lean, but with a stir fry it’s no problem.” And just as with chicken, medium ground beef packs a ton of flavour. Just as there are thousands of ways to prepare a plate of spaghetti, there are many ways to reduce your grocery bill and trim your waste. But my goal was to disrupt my own routine to find where I was wasting money. It was a challenge, but not nearly as difficult as I feared. Integrating the tips collected from Chef Barr and others into my daily routine wasn’t overly tiresome and well worth the effort. By my calculations, they have the potential to save me as much as $1,500 over the course of the year. It’s true that few households will ever be as smoothly and efficiently run as a restaurant. I for one have no plans to make homemade stock from my chicken bones and vegetable ends. Those will always end up in my green bin. But even if you only adopt a few of these tricks at home or at the grocery store, you’ll start to notice modest savings. As Barr explains, it’s all about how you utilize the products when you first pick them up. She stresses that you have to be realistic with yourself: “Am I really going to use this or should I just buy a little less?” Who knows, you might save enough to justify grilling up a few extra rib-eyes this summer.

As a family of four with two kids (now age 13 and 12) our total grocery spend in 2013 was just over $10,000. Way too much I thought. So I actively pursued the ideas in this article, and a few more, and got our 2015 grocery bill down below $8,000. That’s $2,000 less at a time when food prices were shooting up. Two more ideas I followed was 1) shop at the low-end chains and 2) buy the house brands or (even better) those plain yellow package items. Reply ↓ Murray F. on May 8, 2016 at 6:18 pm Lots of great tips in this article. We spend $235 a month for 2 adults and 1 toddler with a $25 a month Stockpile budget. Groceries have always been a challenge for our budget so we started The Grocery Game Challenge back in 2012 on the blog where I’ve blogged and dissected grocery shopping in Canada and continue to do so weekly. Since then many fans have joined in to help lower their grocery budget. It’s amazing what you can do when you document your expenses, plan your shops, price-match, use flyer sales, coupon apps, understand SCOP and much more. It’s nice to keep this category of our budget under control. Reply ↓ canadianbudgetbinder on May 14, 2016 at 6:13 am this is amazing,,,, thank you for sharing this article,,,,,I have been trying ways to save money on my grocery bills, and slowly I have been buying frozen more and found the same flavor and texture as buying fresh,,,,,if you’re cooking with the frozen veggies, the meal was just as good as cooking from fresh,,,I found. I now use frozen turnip, fruits for my smoothies and deserts,,,I use frozen mushrooms and broccoli and cauliflower in my stir-fries now,,,,too bad tomatoes and lettuces doesn’t come frozen lol,,,,, Reply ↓ Jackie Blair on May 16, 2016 at 2:14 pm I can’t believe this is actually advice. I was shocked to read that nothing, absolutely NOTHING here is news worthy. It’s just common sense!, and in most part not really helpful!! Our grocery bill and budget for a family of 4 with 2 growing boys is less than 375/mo ($4500/yr). By the tone of the article, the writer is from the east coast, take it from someone who’s lived in both parts of the country and assimilated the best of both. Invest in a real freezer; purchase a deep freeze of 12 or more cubic feet. More advice: don’t buy at Costco, and stay away from of high end grocery stores, those bananas are the same at Loeb’s or Safeway and probably came from the same distribution warehouse. For our family of 4, we have on average $800-$1100 worth of FIFO frozen food, stored and ready to be thawed for a meal, which with a little planning, goes a long way, Stock up on meat and other frozen whole foods, like fruits & veggies when they ARE in season or on sale. Another item that might have been good to mention (maybe he did but I didn’t read much past point #1) was build from the ground up. Don’t use expensive pre-mixed pasta sauces, make your own with unsweetened crushed tomatoes and your own spices, and throw in finely grated carrot to add sweetness and cut down on acidity, both your health and gut will thank you. Make your own hamburgers, a dash or Worcestershire sauce, an egg, seasoning salt, pepper and quick oats or bread crumbs makes something a lot tastier than what you’ll buy at the store. Couple this with home-made French fries, coated with olive oil, paprika, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder and you’ve got a hearty and wholesome meal. Oh and go ahead make your own stock, it’s easier and much healthier than the store bought varieties, and its MSG free. You want to see a real change in your grocery bill, take the time to plan your meals, prepare what you can ahead of time, and actually take the time to cook. My parting words are: “Never shop on an empty stomach!”. Reply ↓ Giovanni on May 17, 2016 at 1:12 am Giovanni, can you show us the breakdown of your grocery bill per week or month? The author is in Toronto, where space can be tight in homes (deep freezer might not be possible for folks in big cities), and yes, it is from an East Coast city perspective (I suppose), I try to shop at the cheap supermarket chains with my wife, and avoid the pricey chains. We also try to shop for fruits and veggies from local independent fruits and veggie stores (more often than not, the Chinese independent ones across Toronto can be cheaper than the cheap supermarkets). Our avg weekly groceries ranges between $30-$50. Reply ↓ Sonny on May 22, 2016 at 12:33 am Great article. I will definitely look up the sites/articles mentioned. Giovanni you should read past point 1 before wasting your time and commenting. I stopped reading your comment after you admitted you didn’t read the article. What the point for you to comment disagreeing with the article if you didn’t even read it? Reply ↓ Diana on June 17, 2016 at 8:02 pm hi I live in Pt. Claire and recently retired. There are 2 grocery chaines that price adjust the competition, Walmart and Maxi. Before I retired we would check to see which grocer had the best specials that we usually purchased and buy everything there. Now we check all the flyers and usually go to Walmart. We’re saving $150-200 per week, without making any other changes suggested in this very informative article. I’ve read extensively re finances in retirement,yet never the ease of reducing the grocery bill Thanks for an easy to read article Kenny Reply ↓ kenny on June 28, 2016 at 10:35 pm I meant $150-200 per month Kenny Reply ↓ kenny on August 31, 2016 at 6:03 pm good article except for the fact that it is important to support our local farmers and their markets. This is money well spent that goes around many times in our own communities. It also supports our hairdressers, our local governments and innumerable people and keeps us connected. And most importantly it is better for a healthier environment. Please do not make saving a buck the highest good because it isn’t. I am shocked that at this time of common concern for the impact of humans on the environment that one could be so callus as to discourage buying locally. Re: Cohen feels consumers get too caught up in the notion of buying locally and in-season. Reply ↓ Dee on January 16, 2017 at 2:32 pm Learning how to cook from scratch saves money, reduces salt and other additives and isn’t that difficult if you know how. Reinstate food preparation classes in school. Reply ↓ Marci M on February 5, 2017 at 3:27 pm Leave a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The trend is called "Dusting." Police were called to Walmart on South Rutherford Boulevard in recent days where they met with a 23 year old man who was somewhat confused. The North Spring Street resident was found to be in the tree line next to the store when officers arrived. When officers made contact with the man, he was surrounded by cans of aerosol dusters. A police report noted, "I made contact with a subject surrounded by cans of dust cleaner who appeared to be under the influence." Police say the first thing the man asked for were more cans of spray dust cleaner "So he could take the pain away." The man advised that he had been outside for over 24 hours and had been inhaling or huffing about 30 cans of air duster. The 23 year old was transported to St. Thomas Rutherford Hospital and later released. Upon his release from the emergency room, he was taken to the local jail and charged with theft and the unlawful use of an inhalant. The man was booked under a $4,500 bond. What Happens when you inhale? When you inhale it, it fills up your lungs and keeps the good air with oxygen out. It decreases the oxygen to your brain, to your heart. A 2005 USA Today article stated, "The high from the gas paralyzes the user for several minutes and gives a feeling of euphoria. Both dusting and huffing can result in damage to the brain, lungs, heart, kidneys and liver, and can cause death."

In what it calls a “thought exercise,” researcher Baum & Associates LLC estimates most automakers would need to raise vehicle prices by thousands of dollars -- more than $17,000 per vehicle in Jaguar Land Rover’s case, which imports all its vehicles -- to recoup higher costs incurred by a proposed border-adjusted tax. Ford, with significant domestic manufacturing, would need to mull the smallest price hike among major automakers, at about $282 per vehicle, followed by General Motors Co. at $995, according to the report. The estimates aim to show the relative impact of the tax plan on each automaker, according to Alan Baum, the founder of West Bloomfield, Michigan-based Baum & Associates. Carmakers are unlikely to raise prices by more than a few thousand dollars per car and would also likely have to foot some of the higher tax burden. “The plan results in a net cost for automakers,” Baum said by phone. “Each company will then make its own decisions on pricing in order to best compete and maximize its profits.” Volvo and VW vehicle prices would have to rise by about $7,600 and $6,800 on average, according to estimates by Baum & Associates, which advises suppliers. President Donald Trump is said to be warming to the border-adjusted tax after initially viewing it as too complicated. The proposal to begin levying companies’ imports and domestic sales and make exports tax-exempt would completely overhaul the U.S. tax code. General Electric Co. and Boeing Co. are among U.S. manufacturers getting behind the idea, while Toyota Motor Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are among the corporate giants warning it will result in costlier products ranging from food and clothing to gasoline and auto parts. Read more: Ford Seen Reaping Edge Over Toyota With a U.S. Border Tax The Baum & Associates report accounts for imports of both finished vehicles and parts for domestic cars that are made overseas. The one automaker that may be able to keep prices steady would be Model S sedan maker Tesla. The proposed border tax may induce automakers to boost U.S. parts procurement and production from existing vehicle assembly plants, according to the report. Overseas automakers including Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.’s Subaru, Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Mazda Motor Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. may also consider expanding existing U.S. operations or building new capacity. Pure Importers “Pure importers” such as Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo parent company Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd., Mazda and Mitsubishi are most “in the crosshairs” of a border-tax regime due to their total reliance on imports for their U.S. sales, the report said. If the tax is put in place and the companies want to remain competitive, Jaguar Land Rover and Volvo "will need to ramp up U.S. parts sourcing and/or build plants here," the report said. "The border tax approach will otherwise consume all of their profits from selling vehicles here." Volvo is already moving in that direction, with plans to assemble S60 sedans at a new factory in South Carolina starting in late 2018. GM, Fiat Chrysler, Honda, Ford and Tesla each source more than 60 percent of their U.S. vehicle sales domestically, according to the report, with Ford at 82 percent and Tesla exclusively assembling vehicles in California. Hurting Neighbors The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up If auto sales slow, the tax would create an incentive for automakers to keep U.S. plants running at the expense of those in Canada and Mexico. That could encourage Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to accelerate the conversion of factories in Michigan to build pickups there instead of Mexico, said Dan Luria, an economist at the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center in Ann Arbor and the lead author of the Baum & Associates report. Nissan Motor Co. might export more from Mexico to Latin American markets and less to the U.S. Volkswagen AG could build another U.S. assembly plant. Mazda and Mitsubishi, which rely entirely on imports to the U.S. market, may have to quit the U.S. market or pay other manufacturers to assemble their cars, Luria said. In its current form, the proposed border tax could lead to the production of up to 1 million additional vehicles in the U.S. and 50,000 more jobs at car and part assembly plants, Luria said. In a separate report Wednesday, Colin Langan, an analyst at UBS Securities LLC, said the proposed border tax could raise average prices in the U.S. by about 8 percent, or $2,500 per vehicle. That’s enough to reduce annual sales by about 2 million vehicles, he said. Langan said he expects a draft bill to be released in late February or early March. He pegged the chances of a border tax being enacted at less than 50 percent. The tax has a good chance of making its way through the House of Representatives but is “very unlikely” to pass in the Senate, Langan said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

toggle menu Be The Boss Kids Edition She's the Boss Entertainment Love & Relationships Hair Fashion Health MN Business Parenting WATCH MORE WATCH MORE Meet Jasmine Lawrence, The Woman Who Founded Eden BodyWorks When She Was Just A Teenager February 6, 2017  |   By Ann Brown 0 Comments The beauty business is a beast. It’s filled with competitors and very hard to break into — that is unless you have a niche. Jasmine Lawrence, 25, found her niche by offering natural hair products through her company EDEN BodyWorks, and she’s being doing so since she was a teenager. With the help of a $2,000 loan from her parents, the then-teenager launched her company, EDEN BodyWorks and made over $1 million selling her products online. Lawrence suffered from a hair relaxer disaster at age 11, and it was then she vowed to find a solution to better hair care for natural hair. She started making products in her own home. Eventually, she came up with a product line that not only is sold at such major retailers as Wal-Mart, Sally Beauty Supply, Walgreens and Krogers but she caught the attention of Oprah Winfrey and appeared on “The Oprah Winfrey Show” in 2006. And just this year she was inducted into Forbes’ 2017 Class of 30 Under 30, not for her beauty business but for her industry expertise via the world of gaming. You see in addition to running her own business, the Georgia Tech grad and aspiring roboticist is also a project manager at Microsoft on the Xbox One team. MadameNoire had an early morning phone call with the busy entrepreneur about her career path. Here’s what she shared with us. MadameNoire (MN): Why did you decide to go into business for yourself at such a young age? Jasmine Lawrence (JL): When I was young, about 11 years old, I lost a lot of my hair due to a relaxer and this made me not want to use chemicals in my hair. It was a horrible experience for me because I grew up with a bunch of sisters and I had always been into my looks, doing beauty pageants. I was caught up in all of that. So I started to do research, mixing herbs and spices and natural ingredients that I could use on myself, my sisters, and my cousins. We couldn’t afford all the things that said they were natural, so I was trying to make them for myself. It wasn’t until I was 13 that it turned into a business. Instead of going to adventure camp, I went to business camp and got to spend two great weeks in NYC at NYU. We went through this business problem and I learned so much. We got to come up with an idea as we were given $50 to $100 to turn this idea into a business. This was so exciting for me. They took us to the wholesale district to buy what we needed. I spent the whole weekend putting my idea together. My idea was “Sweat and Style.” I glued glitter and rhinestone to headbands. I wanted to look amazing while working out. I felt really empowered by this whole experience and when I got home I started to share the hair products I had made with other people. MN: You were ahead of the curve; now natural haircare products are all over the place. How do you compete with the big beauty companies who have now added products for natural Black hair care? JL: The world has changed over the last 13 years since I started the company. When I started there was a smaller natural hair community, but I have been lucky. Since I started sort of with this movement, I have been able to grow with the community. Unlike the bigger companies, I have developed a close relationship with this community and I am able to address their needs with the products they really want, rather than just throwing products out on the market. Also, we started with the belief that the company wasn’t just here to sell products, we’re here to educate and empower woman about their natural hair. I want to teach you that scalp maintenance is important, to teach people on this natural journey, and show that we are on this journey together. We have also been able to partner with many organizations that empower women on various levels and this has allowed us to give back to the community in non-traditional ways. MN: You were interviewed by Oprah. How did that happen? JL: One of the producers on “The Oprah Winfrey Show” somehow got her hands on our product and had me on for a segment called “World’s Smartest Kids.” I was representing America since I was kind of living the American Dream. I was in high school at the time, in 2006. It was like the biggest thing for me ever! And in 2014 I did a follow-up interview on Oprah’s “Where Are They Now.” MN: You aren’t only running your own successful business, you are in grad school, and are now working at Microsoft. How do you juggle it all? JL: I have to admit my interests have diverged from beauty. Ever since  I was in middle school I wanted to build things, so I started studying construction in high school. But at the same time when I was in high school, this was an amazing growth period for Eden BodyWorks, and this was exactly when I was applying to engineering school. I went to Georgia Tech and spent three years working on robots. I love my work now at Microsoft, and I have a such a close connection to Eden BodyWorks. MN: Would you ever leave Eden BodyWorks behind? JL: It would be hard to give up, it has been so much of my life and the lives of our customers. It has shaped my life and it has been pretty cool to have my own business. Though it is a challenge to juggle both Microsoft and Eden BodyWorks, each allows me to develop different skills that have worked well together. But sometimes it is difficult to choose which has priority. For example, when I decided to go back to school, I didn’t know if I should get an MBA or follow a course of study that would help me at Microsoft. Luckily, I found “Human Centered Design & Engineering” (designing solutions to global challenges by tailoring technology to human needs and interests) at the University of Washington. I can this use for both. It has been amazing!

Comment & Opinion 6 Feb 2017 Here, Andrew Metcalfe, chief technology officer at Ve Interactive, discusses whether SMEs with big brand ambitions can survive without an online marketplace. COMMENT Two thirds of UK SME online retailers plan to increase trade through Etsy, Amazon, eBay, and other online marketplace sites to increase online sales Owen Gough The online marketplace has revolutionised how we shop online. They give people a single destination from which they have access to a myriad of brands and products – the concept is as old as time, of course, but instead of Harrods, Westfield and Walmart we’re talking about Amazon, Etsy, and eBay. The benefits of this all-in-one convenience are obvious for the customer but what of the retailers – especially those less established brands in the earlier stages of development? I certainly appreciate that for retailers in the midst of growth, marketplaces do have an appetising appeal. The online marketplace has the reach to attract new prospects and the logistical heft to handle transactions, leaving the vendor to supply the goods and manage distribution. This has certainly caught the eye of many online retailers with a slew of new research showing that many are rethinking their eCommerce strategies in response to the growing presence of an online marketplace. And with 39 per cent of the eCommerce market expected to be dominated by online marketplaces by 2020, this change of tact certainly looks a prudent move. Much like the TripAdvisor or Expedia dynamic in travel, the immediate opportunities to acquire, engage and convert customers online that these marketplaces can offer would be almost impossible for an aspirational brand to replicate. However, this access comes with a catch. Beware the online marketplace ceiling While there is the immediate (and fully reasonable) financial cost to these things, there is a bigger consequence to consider in the long run. A boost in immediate sales figures are always welcome, but building a brand that people recognise and will seek out time and time again, together with control on your margins is the key to longevity. Building a brand is dependent, especially in the early stages, on creating a memorable connection, something which is jeopardised by an over-reliance of online marketplaces. In terms of evoking sensations, cognitions and behavioural responses from customers towards your brand, online marketplaces dilute the experience, which is a reality that smaller retailers with big brand ambitions should be wary of. One other thing to be careful of is how valuable you really are to the marketplace. If Amazon’s Basics range can recreate your product once they see it is successful, where will you be then? The marketplace has full visibility into what is working on the market and has strength as a result. How to create a brand experience that makes a lasting impression To generate greater loyalty and brand recall from customers, it’s essential that retailers focus on driving direct sales as well as those gained through online marketplaces. This is achieved by first creating a premium brand experience i.e. attracting new and maintaining existing shoppers through highly-relevant marketing. The basis of which is built on knowing how your customer currently behaves and wants to behave on your site. Yet, from what I’ve seen, marketplaces offer little for those SME retailers looking to build a total brand experience, as they lack opportunities for these businesses to capture things like first-party data and act accordingly on it. First-party data is what you, as a business, collect from your own visitors and customers and is undoubtedly the most valuable because of its quality and the fact it comes at no extra cost. The data, which might include things like customers’ purchase or browsing history, provides key insights into the behaviours, interests, and actions demonstrated across a website. Leveraging this data deepens your understanding of existing customers, enabling you to serve them with personalised user experiences, content, recommendations, and services based on interests, locations and intent. In other words, it gives you the ability to create a unique experience for your e-commerce services, across websites, mobile, and social media channels. How can an ambitious retailer build a long-term relationship with a customer if they do not understand the journey they’ve taken, or indeed the touch-points where customers would like brands to engage them? If you know whether your customer likes a promo code each purchase, or is more interested in getting the expensive product to their door as easily as possible you can offer a honed experience for them. An online marketplace might help drive sales in the short term, but won’t help you get the data you need. Data in action A good example of what happens when a business collects and activates their data effectively is our client, Liberty of London. The luxury goods store wanted to reduce cart abandonment and bring more people back to the site. How did they do this? Through harnessing first-party data from their website, that fuelled an intelligent and personalised remarketing strategy. This led to a total revenue uplift of 352 per cent. Balance is key I certainly acknowledge that the impact online marketplaces have had on aspirational retailers is palpable. Greater efforts and pledges from the bigger players in eCommerce to up-skill and improve the digital literacy of the UK’s SMEs are also readily welcomed. The key here is balance. While there are certainly many upsides to the emergence of increasingly influential online marketplaces, for retailers with an eye on long-term success, they must have the confidence to retain a data-driven approach to direct sales.

Nathan Bomey , USA TODAY Part 1 Welcome to the Automation Revolution Share This Story 1,231 Tweet Share Share Pin Email Comment BALTIMORE — The patter of automated machinery fills the air inside wire-basket manufacturer Marlin Steel’s bustling factory in a rugged industrial section of this city. Maxi Cifarelli, 25, of Baltimore, peers through safety goggles at a flat screen, her left knee bent and heel resting on her chair. Two years after earning a fine arts degree from Towson University with a specialty in interdisciplinary object design, she now spends her work days working with a personality-free machine with a name to match: a computer numerical control, or CNC, router. With automation poised to sweep through the economy, some fear that it will kill more jobs than it creates. But Cifarelli’s experience is the opposite. She befriended automation, instead of fighting it, and she has a job because of it. “I haven’t named it,” she said, peering over at the robotic machinery. “I should name it.” Cifarelli is one of 33 employees at Marlin Steel, which has undergone a transformation. Employees used to make wire baskets by hand. Now automation has taken over. High-tech machines do most of the work — and the plant needs workers willing to adapt their skill sets to survive in a rapidly changing economy. Automation has allowed Marlin Steel to thrive, but across the country, workers feel threatened. Donald Trump catapulted into the White House by giving voice to those fears and promising to save American factories and jobs by rewriting trade deals, taxing imports and removing regulations. A robotic arm removes a section of wire from a computerized two-dimensional bending machine before carrying it to an automated welder at Marlin Steel in Baltimore, which has embraced automation to remain competitive with foreign manufacturers. (Photo: Jasper Colt, USA TODAY) Futurists have warned for years that automation will take your job. Now it's happening, albeit in pockets, at manufacturers, warehouses and even some labor-intensive white-collar professions. As the political debate rages over how to inject fresh energy into the American economy with Trump taking office, automation presents perhaps the greatest threat to the American economy. But it may also reflect its greatest opportunity if workers take the Cifarelli route and embrace robotics, artificial intelligence and automation. Either way, it’s poised to accelerate — and if not here, then in foreign countries that will reap the benefits while the American economy suffers a competitive disadvantage. About 49% of worker activities can be turned over to some sort of machine or robot, increasingly helped along by artificial-intelligence software, according to consultancy McKinsey. About 58% of CEOs plan to cut jobs over the next five years because of robotics, while 16% say they plan to hire more people because of robotics, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers survey. As artificial intelligence programs proliferate, automation won't be confined to the factory floor. Positions that involve a substantial amount of predictable work, such as data processing, could succumb to automated software and artificial intelligence. McKinsey counted more than 70 entire professions in which at least 90% of activities can be automated, ranging from mail clerks to ophthalmic lab technicians, tire-repairers, butchers, food preparers and bakers. But many Americans don’t think they need to adapt, with 80% saying their job definitely or probably will exist in its current form in 50 years, according to the Pew Research Center. “We often think about automation as applying to front-line, low-wage, low-skill activities and jobs — and what we’ve discovered is there are some activities that are high-wage, high-skill that are actually very susceptible to automation,” said Michael Chui, a McKinsey Global Institute partner in San Francisco who studies the issue. “Almost every job in the economy has a significant percentage of activities that can be automated." The professional service robot industry expects to sell a third more units from 2016 through 2019 — 333,200 in all — than it sold in the past 17 years, says the International Federation of Robotics. They could be used in place of professionals, whether it's medicine, agriculture, hospitality or even the supermarket down the street. Consider: —Restaurant workers. In fast-food, San Francisco-based Momentum Machines already makes a hamburger-flipping robot. Several chains are gradually introducing self-ordering stations. —Shelf stockers. In stores, San Francisco-based Bossa Nova Robotics has developed a robot that is checking shelf inventory in a test at Lowe’s, the home-improvement chain. —Journalists. Automated Insights has created a software suite called WordSmith that writes thousands of automated stories every month, including Minor League Baseball game accounts and earnings reports for the Associated Press, basketball game recaps for Yahoo! Sports and financial content for dozens of other clients. —Bookkeepers. Accountants — perceived as a steady 9-to-5 job with an average salary of $67,190 in 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics — are poised for a total makeover. About one in five people in the finance and insurance sector primarily perform data processing — and about 85% of that work can be automated, McKinsey estimates. Predictability “The basic gist of it is the more certainty your job entails the more likely is to be automated out,” said Mary (Missy) Cummings, a Duke University professor and director of the Humans and Autonomy Lab. In other words, the more predictable your daily routine is, the more likely your job is to go away. It’s already happening. Walmart announced plans in September to cut 7,000 bookkeeping and store accounting positions as it automates cash management and centralizes the process at its headquarters. In accounting, nimble firms will transition their focus to advising clients based on insights gleaned from automated data. Audits may go from an annual process to a continuous action. Software will increasingly handle the “high-volume, routine, non-judgmental” activities in real time, said Bill Brennan, audit transformation leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers. PwC is now hiring employees for its auditing business with backgrounds in science, technology and engineering. “We need those individuals to help us as we get into data analysis, analytics, data security, cloud computing. The future employee is going to have a combination of those skills,” Brennan said. Cifarelli knows. At Marlin Steel, her college-level education pays off in production work. Pecking periodically at a computer mouse, she delivers detailed instructions, programming the machine to carve small canyons in wood to hold wire that is later welded together with automated equipment to make precision wire baskets, accurate to within 2/1000ths of an inch. She's bonded with her CNC, which she has come to think of as a robot companion. “I need the robot to ensure consistency,” Cifarelli said. “Over the past year, I’ve become really accustomed to the sounds and the movements of it. I can really predict what’s gonna happen. We’re kind of a team.” For Marlin Steel, the problem was straightforward: Automate or die. In the early 2000s, factory workers at the 48-year-old company were forming the big metal baskets typically seen in bagel shops by hand-bending wire at a rate of 300 bends per hour in a grueling manual process. “They all had huge right arms,” Marlin Steel CEO and owner Drew Greenblatt said. CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Marlin Steel in Baltimore, Maryland, was able to stay in business by automating its processes to stay competitive when many other manufacturing jobs went overseas. Video by Jasper Colt, USA TODAY When emerging overseas competitors swooped in and undercut the company on labor costs, producing baskets for less than $6 each to Marlin’s $12, sales cratered. “Our entire business model blew up and we were hemorrhaging,” Greenblatt said. “China was exporting baskets into Manhattan for cheaper than I could buy the steel.” To fight back, the company purchased robotic wire-forming machines and other automated equipment to manufacture precision wire baskets and other metal products for customers that required a higher-quality product, such as Boeing, General Motors, Harley-Davidson and Disney. Because of automation, Marlin Steel nearly doubled its workforce over the last decade to 33 employees and boosted pay from minimum wage when Greenblatt acquired the company to at least $15 per hour today, with some employees making more than $30. “It’s only viable because my employees are like on steroids,” Greenblatt said. “All of a sudden they’re super productive and it’s because we’ve given them the tools — it’s robotics and automation. Thank God for robots. If it wasn’t for robots, these guys would be unemployed.” Foreign competition Marlin Steel may have been ahead of its time. Industrial robots have hit an inflection point — powered by cost reductions and technological improvements in visioning, sensing and gripping — and are poised to accelerate. Although they only perform 10% of tasks in manufacturing today, they will perform 25% by 2025, according to a study by Boston Consulting Group. A computerized puncher stamps pieces out of sheet metal at Marlin Steel in Baltimore, which has embraced automation to remain competitive against foreign manufacturers. (Photo: Jasper Colt, USA TODAY) In one tangible sign of increased automation, those technological improvements have ushered in the dawn of the “collaborative robot,” unleashing automation from protective cages and placing the machinery right next to humans, with sensors protecting the worker and ensuring efficiency. Barclays analysts estimate that global sales of so-called “cobots” will balloon from 4,100 units and $120 million in 2015 to 701,000 and $12 billion in 2025. And it's happening globally. China, for example, is not wasting any time. Amid all the political consternation over alleged currency manipulation and global trade advantages, China is expected to double its installation of industrial robots from 75,000 in 2015 to 150,000 in 2018, nearly four times the rate of North America, according to the International Federation of Robotics. Trump has repeatedly pledged to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., even suggesting that Apple’s iPhone could be made here and exhorting Apple CEO Tim Cook to do so. But that might not be possible without massive automation to make it cost-effective to manufacture in the U.S. Apple’s iPhone manufacturer, Foxconn, in fact, has already begun automating certain work that was previously done by hand. A Chinese government official told a Hong Kong newspaper in May that Foxconn had replaced 60,000 workers with robots at one factory there. And the company is receiving incentives north of Shanghai in the eastern-central Jiangsu Province to accelerate investments in robotics to replace human labor, according to Chinese state media organization Xinhua. As automation advances, globalization will enter a new chapter in which low-cost labor becomes increasingly irrelevant. Unlike humans, robots don’t get paid an hourly wage. So it’s not much more expensive to operate a machine in a developed economy than it is in the developing world. That could be good news for America because it may slow the outflow of investment to other countries. “The fastest growing robotics user in the world is China because they understand that they want a lot of this manufacturing based on low-cost labor, but that’s not the whole game,” said Jeff Burnstein, president of the Association for Advancing Automation. “The game now more than ever is quality, speed and flexibility — and low-cost labor alone is not gonna do it.” The downsides Automation is a double-edged sword, though. Take the example of family-owned Ramsey, Minn.-based injection molder Dynamic Group. The company recently boosted its production by 400% after installing robotic arms made by Universal Robots. Automation bolstered the company’s capability to produce lower-volume, highly complex products that would otherwise not be profitable because the company could not afford to hire workers to craft and manufacture devices with limited commercial appeal. “It’s really hard to be able to be competitive nation- and worldwide coming from this market and having to do that type of labor,” said Joe McGillivray, CEO of Dynamic Group, whose father co-founded the company in 1977. “We’re able to do more work, which will allow us to make more money and pay you better.” Still, the downsides of automation are impossible to ignore. As advanced manufacturing companies adopt more automation, many workers won’t be needed. Nathan Myers operates a two-dimensional bending machine that bends steel wire of various thicknesses into a specific radius for Marlin Steel in Baltimore. (Photo: Jasper Colt, USA TODAY) McGillivray said that by installing robots, Dynamic Group expects to reduce its reliance on temporary workers. In the past, the company had occasionally hired up to 20 temp workers to aid its permanent staff of 106 workers. “We would instead be using robots as our flex labor instead of people as our flex labor,” he said. Artificial intelligence If automation evokes imagery of robots replacing humans, then its close relative, artificial intelligence, conjures fears of computers taking dominion over humans. But those fears, while perhaps not unfounded in the distant future, fail to reflect AI’s emerging role as an assistant to people in the workplace. At Boston-based start-up Lola, two executives who were almost single-handedly responsible for replacing travel agents with computers — that is, one of automation’s most obvious examples of displacement — are reviving the travel agent through artificial intelligence. The 50-person company has developed an AI-based system — which basically just means a bunch of software algorithms — to aid human travel agents in making recommendations to travelers, booking accommodations and addressing itinerary hiccups. “We think most travelers would rather talk to a human because the human will understand them 100% of the time, so we use the bots to back them up,” said Lola CEO Paul English, who co-founded travel listings site Kayak.com and served as the company’s chief technology officer. “If we’re successful we’ll have thousands of travel agents, perhaps tens of thousands of travel agents working exclusively for Lola.” The AI, which English affectionately refers to as a bot, can crawl through a user’s email inbox, for example, to identify travel preferences and scheduling quirks. Those insights are translated into intelligence that the travel agents use to improve their customer's experience. For Lola Chairman Barney Harford, former CEO of travel booking site Orbitz and former executive at Expedia, it’s a sharp turn from his previous life ushering in the age of do-it-yourself travel. “We are bringing humans back into the picture,” Harford said. Part 2 How to make your job automation-proof For Canyon Gamble, robots aren’t the enemy — they’re a ticket to prosperity. The 19-year-old last year chose a decidedly high-tech career path, completing a special automation certification program at the tech center known in Marion, Ohio, simply as RAMTEC. It's already paying off. “I’ve had two or three job offers just in the past month,” he said, noting chances to work on computer-aided design (CAD) and 3D CAD. “I don’t need a college degree just because of how the field works. If you can prove you can do it, you most likely can get the job." At a time when automation is poised to eliminate entire professions across America, students like Gamble and some industry professionals are trying to outrun the revolution. For workers to survive with good jobs that are increasingly automated, it's worth considering the old adage: If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em. Or in this case, gain skills in programming, maintaining or fixing industrial robots or automated software. One strategy is to embrace a profession with little predictable work. Canyon Gamble of Marion, Ohio, reviews a three-dimensional gripper he developed for a Universal Robot arm through training at the Tri-Rivers Career Center’s Robotics & Advanced Manufacturing Technology Education Collaborative in his hometown. (Photo: KimAronson.com) A study by consultancy McKinsey found more than 70 professions in which no more than 10% of activities are susceptible to automation based on currently accessible technology. Those automation-proof jobs include posts such as special education teacher, transit police, tree trimmer, purchasing agent, multimedia artist and animator, psychiatrist, occupational health specialist, mathematician, music director, economist, astronomer and clergy. Adapting may be the only way to avoid tumbling into unemployment as automation sweeps workers out of entire fields. The good news: Automation technology jobs are lucrative. Careers in advanced manufacturing automation range in salary from $40,000 to $60,000 for high-school grads with certification from a center like RAMTEC and from $50,000 to $70,000 for associate degree grads from junior colleges with similar training, said Paul Aiello, director of certified education training for Japanese robotics maker Fanuc. By contrast, the national median compensation for Americans with only an associate's degree is $41,496, while the median compensation for someone with only a high school diploma is $35,256, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Not all of this critical training comes in classrooms. Some workers manage to figure it out on their own. Joshua Wallace, 33, a robotics technician at Marlin Steel in Baltimore, taught himself how to improve some of the company’s robotics systems by watching videos on YouTube. “If I run into a problem it’s amazing — just jump online. I jump on a forum,” says Wallace, an Army veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq. “Surprisingly there’s a couple things I just learned that would have really helped out months ago and a three-minute video shows me how to break it down and do it. I’m like, 'Oh my, it’s so simple.'” Another way to keep the automation revolution from swallowing your job is to devise a role that turns the tables on tech. Mari Vance did. Vance, 25, of Las Vegas, recently had her hours cut almost in half, from full-time to part-time, working as a parking booth attendant when the hotel-casino where she worked installed an automated ticketing booth. Needing more work, she left her job and struck out on her own. She decided to design a role-playing game for computers, raising more than $15,000 through crowd fundraising site Kickstarter to create a visual novel video game called Dragon Date, using self-taught skills. “I have a theory that 20 years from now we’re all going to be technicians and all the service jobs are going to be automated,” she said. "In the long term, I feel like creative jobs and stuff like that are the jobs that are most immune to automation." She's got a point. The pace of advanced robotics installation is expected to go from 2% to 3% annual growth today to 10% growth within a decade, according to Boston Consulting Group. Educators need to adjust the pace at which they revise their own programs. CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share RAMTEC is an Ohio technical center that offers high school students training in the field of robotics and advanced manufacturing technologies. That’s what happened at RAMTEC, which stands for Robotic Advanced Manufacturing Technical Education Collaborative. Chuck Speelman, superintendent of the Tri-Rivers Career Center, said the organization realized several years ago after a series of candid conversations with local manufacturers that its robotics program was not teaching marketable skills or using up-to-date equipment. “They pretty much told us that what we were doing was a waste of time,” he said. “We had to change the paradigm.” In partnership with robotics companies, local manufacturers and educators, Tri-Rivers Career Center designed a system that is now being replicated throughout the state. High school students enrolled for free at RAMTEC continue earning their traditional diplomas while also collecting skills that local businesses such as global automaker Honda, which has plants in Ohio, and robotics refurbishing firm Robot Works are demanding. Companies are pitching in. For example, Fanuc donated software training programs and sold cutting-edge robotics systems to RAMTEC at a steep discount. The company already trains about 8,000 to 9,000 people annually through its own network of paid courses, but is running at 99% capacity. “We can’t keep up,” Aiello said. “The only way to put a dent in the demand is to partner with education.” Follow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.

Scheduled TARTA bus service should be popular with King Branch Library patrons, Benjamin Malczewski, a Toledo-Lucas County Public Library spokesman, said. THE BLADE Buy This Image Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print The Toledo Area Regional Transit Authority has scheduled public hearings next week to discuss adding regular buses along King and Brint roads to a new library branch and nearby shopping and elder-care destinations. TARTA’s new Route 6 will operate in both directions around a dog-shaped loop touching Franklin Park Mall, the Central Avenue Meijer and Wal-Mart stores, the King Road Branch library, and ProMedica Flower Hospital, along with a spur serving Lourdes University and downtown Sylvania. It is planned to replace Route 2C, which also serves the mall, Lourdes, and downtown Sylvania but runs via Secor and Alexis roads on outbound trips and travels out Sylvania’s Erie Street to Centennial Terrace. Centennial Terrace will continue to be served by the Route 39/​39M express routes that run during the morning and afternoon rush hours, but bus riders wishing to go to or from that area midday or in the early evening will have to connect to one of the Sylvania Call-a-Ride buses once Route 6 replaces Route 2C. That change, the cancellation of two lightly used commuter express routes, and other service changes proposed to take effect March 19 are to be discussed during two hearings Feb. 15 at TARTA’s Toledo administrative offices and a third the next day at the Sylvania Branch Library. The Feb. 15 hearings will begin at 12:30 p.m. and 6 p.m. at 1127 W. Central Ave., Toledo. The Feb. 16 hearing will begin at 6 p.m. in the library at 6749 Monroe St., Sylvania. James Gee, the transit authority’s general manager, told the TARTA board of trustees Thursday the creation of Route 6 was based on heavy demand for travel to and from the library, the Kingston Residence nursing home, and the Kroger and Timberstone Center shopping area on Sylvania Avenue west of King. “This will help relieve the burden on the Call-a-Rides” while establishing direct service from Franklin Park Mall instead of requiring passengers to make reservations for, and connect with, the Sylvania Call-a-Ride in downtown Sylvania or along Central Avenue, Mr. Gee said. The new route is proposed to run roughly hourly — more often during rush hours — just as the Route 2C now does. Demand for bus service to the library “positively reflects the impact the library has made in that corner of Lucas County in the short amount of time the library has been open,” said Benjamin Malczewski, a Toledo-Lucas County Public Library spokesman. Scheduled bus service should be popular with library patrons, Mr. Malczewski said. The library also is working with the city of Sylvania, Sylvania Township, and the Sylvania schools on a project to add sidewalks to Sylvania Avenue for better pedestrian access from Southview High School. The routes to be canceled are the Route 7 Sylvania Township Express, which operates once each way, morning and afternoon, between the Central Avenue Meijer and downtown Toledo, and the Route 42 Miracle Mile Express, which runs once inbound in the morning and outbound in the afternoon. Mr. Gee said Sylvania Township commuters can be accommodated on the Route 20M Central Avenue bus, while Miracle Mile commuters can ride increased service on the Route 17 or Route 26 buses, all of which serve that park-and-ride lot. The Miracle Mile Express lost substantial ridership once the Ohio Department of Transportation closed the Berdan Avenue entrance to southbound I-75 last year as part of ongoing freeway reconstruction, the transit manager said. “The express route really became a non-express route,” he said, adding that the service could be reinstated once a rebuilt I-75 entrance at Willys Parkway opens. Cheaper gasoline prices also have hurt TARTA’s commuter routes in general, Mr. Gee said. “If [the price of] gas gets to the point it was a few years ago, we would certainly look at putting these services back on,” he said.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 February 2017 by Military News Trump Economic Council Excludes Small Business Leaders, ASBL Reports PETALUMA, Calif., Feb. 6, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ — Today Donald Trump introduced the members of his economic council with a conspicuous absence of anyone from the small business community. Having stated that he would be the „greatest jobs president God ever created,” and create 25 million new jobs, it’s curious the individuals on his business council are primarily from Fortune 500 firms and large corporations. Jack Welch, former chairman and CEO of General Electric, a corporation famous for its aggressive job outsourcing, is on the council as well as 16 other members from corporations such as Walmart, PepsiCo, General Motors, IBM, Boeing, Walt Disney Co. and Tesla Inc. „We’re bringing back jobs” Trump told the press before their first meeting. According to government data 98% of all U.S firms have less than 100 employees and they create 97% of all net new jobs. There are 28 million small businesses in America that are responsible for half of the GDP, half the private sector work force and 90% of U.S exporters. In 2006, a Kauffman foundation study found that 100% of the new jobs since 1988 have come from new businesses which are overwhelmingly small businesses. „If the purpose of the economic council is to try to increase corporate profits by shipping jobs overseas that’s definitely the right group to talk to,” said American Small Business League President Lloyd Chapman. „President Trump has promised to be the greatest Jobs producing president God ever created. Someone needs to show him the U.S Census bureau data that shows small businesses create 97% of all the net new jobs. I haven’t seen one economic policy put forth by the Trump administration that is specifically intended to benefit small businesses, and I don’t expect we will. I’m very disappointed that his economic committee should be 98% percent small business leaders and it’s just the opposite.

Nathan Bomey , USA TODAY Part 1 Welcome to the Automation Revolution Share This Story 1,231 Tweet Share Share Pin Email Comment BALTIMORE — The patter of automated machinery fills the air inside wire-basket manufacturer Marlin Steel’s bustling factory in a rugged industrial section of this city. Maxi Cifarelli, 25, of Baltimore, peers through safety goggles at a flat screen, her left knee bent and heel resting on her chair. Two years after earning a fine arts degree from Towson University with a specialty in interdisciplinary object design, she now spends her work days working with a personality-free machine with a name to match: a computer numerical control, or CNC, router. With automation poised to sweep through the economy, some fear that it will kill more jobs than it creates. But Cifarelli’s experience is the opposite. She befriended automation, instead of fighting it, and she has a job because of it. “I haven’t named it,” she said, peering over at the robotic machinery. “I should name it.” Cifarelli is one of 33 employees at Marlin Steel, which has undergone a transformation. Employees used to make wire baskets by hand. Now automation has taken over. High-tech machines do most of the work — and the plant needs workers willing to adapt their skill sets to survive in a rapidly changing economy. Automation has allowed Marlin Steel to thrive, but across the country, workers feel threatened. Donald Trump catapulted into the White House by giving voice to those fears and promising to save American factories and jobs by rewriting trade deals, taxing imports and removing regulations.

(Photo: Jasper Colt, USA TODAY) Futurists have warned for years that automation will take your job. Now it's happening, albeit in pockets, at manufacturers, warehouses and even some labor-intensive white-collar professions. As the political debate rages over how to inject fresh energy into the American economy with Trump taking office, automation presents perhaps the greatest threat to the American economy. But it may also reflect its greatest opportunity if workers take the Cifarelli route and embrace robotics, artificial intelligence and automation. Either way, it’s poised to accelerate — and if not here, then in foreign countries that will reap the benefits while the American economy suffers a competitive disadvantage. About 49% of worker activities can be turned over to some sort of machine or robot, increasingly helped along by artificial-intelligence software, according to consultancy McKinsey. About 58% of CEOs plan to cut jobs over the next five years because of robotics, while 16% say they plan to hire more people because of robotics, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers survey. As artificial intelligence programs proliferate, automation won't be confined to the factory floor. Positions that involve a substantial amount of predictable work, such as data processing, could succumb to automated software and artificial intelligence. McKinsey counted more than 70 entire professions in which at least 90% of activities can be automated, ranging from mail clerks to ophthalmic lab technicians, tire-repairers, butchers, food preparers and bakers. But many Americans don’t think they need to adapt, with 80% saying their job definitely or probably will exist in its current form in 50 years, according to the Pew Research Center. “We often think about automation as applying to front-line, low-wage, low-skill activities and jobs — and what we’ve discovered is there are some activities that are high-wage, high-skill that are actually very susceptible to automation,” said Michael Chui, a McKinsey Global Institute partner in San Francisco who studies the issue. “Almost every job in the economy has a significant percentage of activities that can be automated." The professional service robot industry expects to sell a third more units from 2016 through 2019 — 333,200 in all — than it sold in the past 17 years, says the International Federation of Robotics. They could be used in place of professionals, whether it's medicine, agriculture, hospitality or even the supermarket down the street. Consider: —Restaurant workers. In fast-food, San Francisco-based Momentum Machines already makes a hamburger-flipping robot. Several chains are gradually introducing self-ordering stations. —Shelf stockers. In stores, San Francisco-based Bossa Nova Robotics has developed a robot that is checking shelf inventory in a test at Lowe’s, the home-improvement chain. —Journalists. Automated Insights has created a software suite called WordSmith that writes thousands of automated stories every month, including Minor League Baseball game accounts and earnings reports for the Associated Press, basketball game recaps for Yahoo! Sports and financial content for dozens of other clients. —Bookkeepers. Accountants — perceived as a steady 9-to-5 job with an average salary of $67,190 in 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics — are poised for a total makeover. About one in five people in the finance and insurance sector primarily perform data processing — and about 85% of that work can be automated, McKinsey estimates. Predictability “The basic gist of it is the more certainty your job entails the more likely is to be automated out,” said Mary (Missy) Cummings, a Duke University professor and director of the Humans and Autonomy Lab. In other words, the more predictable your daily routine is, the more likely your job is to go away. It’s already happening. Walmart announced plans in September to cut 7,000 bookkeeping and store accounting positions as it automates cash management and centralizes the process at its headquarters. In accounting, nimble firms will transition their focus to advising clients based on insights gleaned from automated data. Audits may go from an annual process to a continuous action. Software will increasingly handle the “high-volume, routine, non-judgmental” activities in real time, said Bill Brennan, audit transformation leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers. PwC is now hiring employees for its auditing business with backgrounds in science, technology and engineering. “We need those individuals to help us as we get into data analysis, analytics, data security, cloud computing. The future employee is going to have a combination of those skills,” Brennan said. Cifarelli knows. At Marlin Steel, her college-level education pays off in production work. Pecking periodically at a computer mouse, she delivers detailed instructions, programming the machine to carve small canyons in wood to hold wire that is later welded together with automated equipment to make precision wire baskets, accurate to within 2/1000ths of an inch. She's bonded with her CNC, which she has come to think of as a robot companion. “I need the robot to ensure consistency,” Cifarelli said. “Over the past year, I’ve become really accustomed to the sounds and the movements of it. I can really predict what’s gonna happen. We’re kind of a team.” For Marlin Steel, the problem was straightforward: Automate or die. In the early 2000s, factory workers at the 48-year-old company were forming the big metal baskets typically seen in bagel shops by hand-bending wire at a rate of 300 bends per hour in a grueling manual process. “They all had huge right arms,” Marlin Steel CEO and owner Drew Greenblatt said. CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Marlin Steel in Baltimore, Maryland, was able to stay in business by automating its processes to stay competitive when many other manufacturing jobs went overseas. Video by Jasper Colt, USA TODAY When emerging overseas competitors swooped in and undercut the company on labor costs, producing baskets for less than $6 each to Marlin’s $12, sales cratered. “Our entire business model blew up and we were hemorrhaging,” Greenblatt said. “China was exporting baskets into Manhattan for cheaper than I could buy the steel.” To fight back, the company purchased robotic wire-forming machines and other automated equipment to manufacture precision wire baskets and other metal products for customers that required a higher-quality product, such as Boeing, General Motors, Harley-Davidson and Disney. Because of automation, Marlin Steel nearly doubled its workforce over the last decade to 33 employees and boosted pay from minimum wage when Greenblatt acquired the company to at least $15 per hour today, with some employees making more than $30. “It’s only viable because my employees are like on steroids,” Greenblatt said. “All of a sudden they’re super productive and it’s because we’ve given them the tools — it’s robotics and automation. Thank God for robots. If it wasn’t for robots, these guys would be unemployed.” Foreign competition Marlin Steel may have been ahead of its time. Industrial robots have hit an inflection point — powered by cost reductions and technological improvements in visioning, sensing and gripping — and are poised to accelerate. Although they only perform 10% of tasks in manufacturing today, they will perform 25% by 2025, according to a study by Boston Consulting Group. A computerized puncher stamps pieces out of sheet metal at Marlin Steel in Baltimore, which has embraced automation to remain competitive against foreign manufacturers. (Photo: Jasper Colt, USA TODAY) In one tangible sign of increased automation, those technological improvements have ushered in the dawn of the “collaborative robot,” unleashing automation from protective cages and placing the machinery right next to humans, with sensors protecting the worker and ensuring efficiency. Barclays analysts estimate that global sales of so-called “cobots” will balloon from 4,100 units and $120 million in 2015 to 701,000 and $12 billion in 2025. And it's happening globally. China, for example, is not wasting any time. Amid all the political consternation over alleged currency manipulation and global trade advantages, China is expected to double its installation of industrial robots from 75,000 in 2015 to 150,000 in 2018, nearly four times the rate of North America, according to the International Federation of Robotics. Trump has repeatedly pledged to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., even suggesting that Apple’s iPhone could be made here and exhorting Apple CEO Tim Cook to do so. But that might not be possible without massive automation to make it cost-effective to manufacture in the U.S. Apple’s iPhone manufacturer, Foxconn, in fact, has already begun automating certain work that was previously done by hand. A Chinese government official told a Hong Kong newspaper in May that Foxconn had replaced 60,000 workers with robots at one factory there. And the company is receiving incentives north of Shanghai in the eastern-central Jiangsu Province to accelerate investments in robotics to replace human labor, according to Chinese state media organization Xinhua. As automation advances, globalization will enter a new chapter in which low-cost labor becomes increasingly irrelevant. Unlike humans, robots don’t get paid an hourly wage. So it’s not much more expensive to operate a machine in a developed economy than it is in the developing world. That could be good news for America because it may slow the outflow of investment to other countries. “The fastest growing robotics user in the world is China because they understand that they want a lot of this manufacturing based on low-cost labor, but that’s not the whole game,” said Jeff Burnstein, president of the Association for Advancing Automation. “The game now more than ever is quality, speed and flexibility — and low-cost labor alone is not gonna do it.” The downsides Automation is a double-edged sword, though. Take the example of family-owned Ramsey, Minn.-based injection molder Dynamic Group. The company recently boosted its production by 400% after installing robotic arms made by Universal Robots. Automation bolstered the company’s capability to produce lower-volume, highly complex products that would otherwise not be profitable because the company could not afford to hire workers to craft and manufacture devices with limited commercial appeal. “It’s really hard to be able to be competitive nation- and worldwide coming from this market and having to do that type of labor,” said Joe McGillivray, CEO of Dynamic Group, whose father co-founded the company in 1977. “We’re able to do more work, which will allow us to make more money and pay you better.” Still, the downsides of automation are impossible to ignore. As advanced manufacturing companies adopt more automation, many workers won’t be needed. Nathan Myers operates a two-dimensional bending machine that bends steel wire of various thicknesses into a specific radius for Marlin Steel in Baltimore. (Photo: Jasper Colt, USA TODAY) McGillivray said that by installing robots, Dynamic Group expects to reduce its reliance on temporary workers. In the past, the company had occasionally hired up to 20 temp workers to aid its permanent staff of 106 workers. “We would instead be using robots as our flex labor instead of people as our flex labor,” he said. Artificial intelligence If automation evokes imagery of robots replacing humans, then its close relative, artificial intelligence, conjures fears of computers taking dominion over humans. But those fears, while perhaps not unfounded in the distant future, fail to reflect AI’s emerging role as an assistant to people in the workplace. At Boston-based start-up Lola, two executives who were almost single-handedly responsible for replacing travel agents with computers — that is, one of automation’s most obvious examples of displacement — are reviving the travel agent through artificial intelligence. The 50-person company has developed an AI-based system — which basically just means a bunch of software algorithms — to aid human travel agents in making recommendations to travelers, booking accommodations and addressing itinerary hiccups. “We think most travelers would rather talk to a human because the human will understand them 100% of the time, so we use the bots to back them up,” said Lola CEO Paul English, who co-founded travel listings site Kayak.com and served as the company’s chief technology officer. “If we’re successful we’ll have thousands of travel agents, perhaps tens of thousands of travel agents working exclusively for Lola.” The AI, which English affectionately refers to as a bot, can crawl through a user’s email inbox, for example, to identify travel preferences and scheduling quirks. Those insights are translated into intelligence that the travel agents use to improve their customer's experience. For Lola Chairman Barney Harford, former CEO of travel booking site Orbitz and former executive at Expedia, it’s a sharp turn from his previous life ushering in the age of do-it-yourself travel. “We are bringing humans back into the picture,” Harford said. Part 2 How to make your job automation-proof For Canyon Gamble, robots aren’t the enemy — they’re a ticket to prosperity. The 19-year-old last year chose a decidedly high-tech career path, completing a special automation certification program at the tech center known in Marion, Ohio, simply as RAMTEC. It's already paying off. “I’ve had two or three job offers just in the past month,” he said, noting chances to work on computer-aided design (CAD) and 3D CAD. “I don’t need a college degree just because of how the field works. If you can prove you can do it, you most likely can get the job." At a time when automation is poised to eliminate entire professions across America, students like Gamble and some industry professionals are trying to outrun the revolution. For workers to survive with good jobs that are increasingly automated, it's worth considering the old adage: If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em. Or in this case, gain skills in programming, maintaining or fixing industrial robots or automated software. One strategy is to embrace a profession with little predictable work. Canyon Gamble of Marion, Ohio, reviews a three-dimensional gripper he developed for a Universal Robot arm through training at the Tri-Rivers Career Center’s Robotics & Advanced Manufacturing Technology Education Collaborative in his hometown. (Photo: KimAronson.com) A study by consultancy McKinsey found more than 70 professions in which no more than 10% of activities are susceptible to automation based on currently accessible technology. Those automation-proof jobs include posts such as special education teacher, transit police, tree trimmer, purchasing agent, multimedia artist and animator, psychiatrist, occupational health specialist, mathematician, music director, economist, astronomer and clergy. Adapting may be the only way to avoid tumbling into unemployment as automation sweeps workers out of entire fields. The good news: Automation technology jobs are lucrative. Careers in advanced manufacturing automation range in salary from $40,000 to $60,000 for high-school grads with certification from a center like RAMTEC and from $50,000 to $70,000 for associate degree grads from junior colleges with similar training, said Paul Aiello, director of certified education training for Japanese robotics maker Fanuc. By contrast, the national median compensation for Americans with only an associate's degree is $41,496, while the median compensation for someone with only a high school diploma is $35,256, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Not all of this critical training comes in classrooms. Some workers manage to figure it out on their own. Joshua Wallace, 33, a robotics technician at Marlin Steel in Baltimore, taught himself how to improve some of the company’s robotics systems by watching videos on YouTube. “If I run into a problem it’s amazing — just jump online. I jump on a forum,” says Wallace, an Army veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq. “Surprisingly there’s a couple things I just learned that would have really helped out months ago and a three-minute video shows me how to break it down and do it. I’m like, 'Oh my, it’s so simple.'” Another way to keep the automation revolution from swallowing your job is to devise a role that turns the tables on tech. Mari Vance did. Vance, 25, of Las Vegas, recently had her hours cut almost in half, from full-time to part-time, working as a parking booth attendant when the hotel-casino where she worked installed an automated ticketing booth. Needing more work, she left her job and struck out on her own. She decided to design a role-playing game for computers, raising more than $15,000 through crowd fundraising site Kickstarter to create a visual novel video game called Dragon Date, using self-taught skills. “I have a theory that 20 years from now we’re all going to be technicians and all the service jobs are going to be automated,” she said. "In the long term, I feel like creative jobs and stuff like that are the jobs that are most immune to automation." She's got a point. The pace of advanced robotics installation is expected to go from 2% to 3% annual growth today to 10% growth within a decade, according to Boston Consulting Group. Educators need to adjust the pace at which they revise their own programs. CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share RAMTEC is an Ohio technical center that offers high school students training in the field of robotics and advanced manufacturing technologies. That’s what happened at RAMTEC, which stands for Robotic Advanced Manufacturing Technical Education Collaborative. Chuck Speelman, superintendent of the Tri-Rivers Career Center, said the organization realized several years ago after a series of candid conversations with local manufacturers that its robotics program was not teaching marketable skills or using up-to-date equipment. “They pretty much told us that what we were doing was a waste of time,” he said. “We had to change the paradigm.” In partnership with robotics companies, local manufacturers and educators, Tri-Rivers Career Center designed a system that is now being replicated throughout the state. High school students enrolled for free at RAMTEC continue earning their traditional diplomas while also collecting skills that local businesses such as global automaker Honda, which has plants in Ohio, and robotics refurbishing firm Robot Works are demanding. Companies are pitching in. For example, Fanuc donated software training programs and sold cutting-edge robotics systems to RAMTEC at a steep discount. The company already trains about 8,000 to 9,000 people annually through its own network of paid courses, but is running at 99% capacity. “We can’t keep up,” Aiello said. “The only way to put a dent in the demand is to partner with education.” Follow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.

The 33-year-old “Vice” singer confessed that she started “drinking a little extra” after the headline-making divorce from her husband of four years. Always amazing performer! And always amazing live!! These last three nights did not disappoint! #highwayvagabondtour @mirandalambert pic.twitter.com/93Mw7Tjndq — Matthew Hodgdon (@chefhodgie) February 5, 2017 Although Shelton himself seems happy in his new relationship with Gwen Stefani, Miranda Lambert apparently hasn’t moved on just yet. The country singer told the crowd at her recent concert that she started “drinking a little extra” after the divorce. While Miranda Lambert’s confession about her alleged problem with alcohol sounded like a joke, fans are concerned that there may be a little truth behind the joke. The same day before embarking on her “Highway Vagabond” tour, which kicked off on January 24, Lambert reportedly confessed while performing at an intimate show at Joe’s Bar in Chicago that she “started drinking a little extra.” Miranda Lambert also revealed what inspired her track “Ugly Lights” from her 2016’s studio album The Weight of These Wings. “Anyways, I found myself in Midtown in Nashville three nights in a row at like last call and with the lights coming on, and I’m still sitting there.” I laughed I cried, thank you for makin me feel everything in the world 2nite???? @mirandalambert #highwayvagabondtour pic.twitter.com/LLPdKe30UY — Danielle Barberi (@dani_b208) February 5, 2017 And Miranda Lambert, who is currently dating musician Anderson East, thought it would be a good idea to write a song about it, which is how “Ugly Lights” was born. Lambert and Shelton went public with their split in July 2015 after nearly four years of marriage. In fact, Miranda Lambert has even previously revealed that her headline-making divorce from Shelton inspired her latest LP. In her interview with Billboard, Lambert confessed that no matter how old she is, every song she has ever written was “a reflection of where I am right then in my life.” Miranda Lambert decided to “journal” her life, both her good and bad days, through her music. The country singer also revealed that has always been “pretty straightforward” in her music. “With my songwriting, it’s taking a journey with what’s been going on in my everyday life — good, bad, ugly and everything in between.” Wow, what a show! @mirandalambert you are amazing, and you ROCK! #girlpower #catpower #catcountry pic.twitter.com/zJDAvmJYis — Jake The Cat (@JakeTheCat981) February 3, 2017 Miranda Lambert, whose “Highway Vagabond” tour’s American leg is going to conclude in August before she heads to Europe, added that putting in her art “something really honest” has always been “the right thing to do.” Miranda Lambert’s net worth may be currently standing at $40 million, but when she needs to pick up products for her everyday life, she goes to Walmart, according to Rare Country. The 33-year-old singer admitted that she recently went on a Walmart run and confessed that she loves discounts! Well, who doesn’t? In her recent radio interview, Miranda Lambert revealed she’s regularly shopping at the discount retailer. “I go there all the time. I go to Target every weekend. Last weekend I went to the Walmart in Dickson because I have a farm out in the country.” But Miranda Lambert apparently doesn’t love everything about Walmart as she once stumbled across her own CD Crazy Ex-Girlfriend in the bargain bin there. And finding her 2007 album there “upset” her, the country singer confessed. Miranda Lambert added that she was with her boyfriend East, who tried to comfort the country singer by saying, “Hey, at least you are on sale.” Even though she is an internationally famous country singer, Lambert has always been humble and honest about her everyday life. Well I didn’t find any @mirandalambert in the Walmart Bargain Bin, but I did find plenty of BS! pic.twitter.com/MwFdMMs0ZO — No_BS_Here (@sweetxt) February 5, 2017 Take her revelation/joke about the drinking problem, for example. While most celebrities would try to hide it in the deepest corners of their dark secrets, Lambert didn’t shy away from talking about it.

Last week, animal-rights organization Compassion Over Killing released the first ever undercover footage captured at a lamb slaughterhouse in the United States. The hidden-camera footage was captured at California-based Superior Farms, the largest producer of lamb in the country, and supplier to mega-chains Walmart and Kroger. The video captured workers ineffectively slashing lambs’ throats and cutting off their tails while they were still conscious, amongst other egregious abuses that former USDA chief veterinary meat inspector Lester Castro Friedlander classified as violations of the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act. COK also documented workers failing to send meat through metal detectors (as mandated by company policy) and altering “best by” dates on packaged products—actions that raise health concerns for human consumption. “As we captured on camera inside Superior Farms,” COK’s executive director Erica Meier says, “consumers can now see what these gentle lambs are forced to endure in their final days.” In addition to meat, Superior Farms sells lambskin to the fashion industry, as well as animal parts—such as lungs, tails, trachea, and ears—to be used for producing dog treats. Meier advises that, “The best way we can help lambs and all animals is to leave them off our plates.” COK’s footage comes on the heels of last week’s release of a similar video documenting cruelty against pigs, captured by animal-rights group Mercy for Animals at Hormel supplier (and largest pork producer in the country) The Maschhoffs in Oklahoma.

Nothing much ordinarily, but that might change if a U.S. border adjustment tax becomes a reality. It all depends on how Asian suppliers deal with the proposed levy. The impact on them would be uneven, and not just because they have different levels of exposure to the American market. Some, like Li & Fung Ltd., might even benefit by helping global retailers navigate a confusing barrage of tariff structures, Gadfly's Shelly Banjo has argued. Tax Tremors Asian clothing and shoe suppliers have been hurt by U.S. border-adjustment tax rhetoric Source: Bloomberg *Market capitalization weighted average of 11 stocks tracked by Credit Suisse. But investors aren't too sanguine, as this share price chart of some of the largest Asian vendors tracked by Credit Suisse shows. Shareholders' fears are well founded. Should President Donald Trump adopt a 20 percent destination-based corporate tax, also known as a border adjustment tax, U.S. merchandise importers won't be able to claim a deduction on expenses incurred overseas (including labor costs). It would have the same effect as an additional levy on top of the existing average U.S. tariff of 11.5 percent on textiles and 17 percent on footwear imports. Trump's proposed border tax 20% The pain would likely be shared three ways. Shoppers at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. would have to pay more; the retailers would have to accept a thinner profit margin; and their suppliers in Asia would be forced to accept lower prices. It's hard to predict the outcome of that complex bargaining process. But if it leads to a 5 percent drop in the price received in Asia, then the $1.9 billion profit of 11 Hong Kong and Taiwan-listed vendors on $36 billion of combined revenue could drop by a fifth. Stella International Holdings Ltd., Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Ltd., Li & Fung and Makalot Industrial Co. could be the "most sensitive," according to Credit Suisse.  If Border Tax Comes A 5% cut in ex-factory prices for Asian suppliers could cause their earnings to tumble Source: Credit Suisse That isn't all. Should U.S. import volumes also slide, the impact could be even fiercer. Conversely, if the dollar rises in response to the tax, some of the pain for Asian exporters could ease. A weaker home currency, however, would mean a higher cost of living in Asia. That might be doubly worrisome if practically every country in the region -- from China, India, Indonesia, and Thailand to Pakistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Sri Lanka -- started losing jobs in labor-intensive production. Retaliation would be almost inevitable. U.S. banks' hopes to put their capital to work in Asia, especially if Trump's review of Dodd-Frank rules gives them additional leeway, could come a cropper if governments in the region block their expansion. The likelihood of tit-for-tat measures shouldn't be dismissed. Trade skirmishes are casting a shadow even over regional trade, such as between China and South Korea, as Asia witnesses a resurgence of nationalism in economic policy-making. Sample the recent blacklisting of JPMorgan Chase & Co. by the Indonesian government over an unfavorable research report.  If nothing else, this is just one of the many ways a U.S. border adjustment tax could cause the globalization cookie to crumble. Wall Street should put its lobbying might to work to dissuade the Trump administration from raising the cost of accessing U.S. consumers for Asian firms. Otherwise, global banks, too, might have to pay a price for those more expensive shoes and handbags. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

Asda will loan you the cash to buy a new car, before selling you annual insurance and breakdown cover. Then it’ll provide fuel, oils, parts, accessories, safety kit, mobile phones for gloveboxes plus countless other automotive products. But direct or indirect retailing of price-slashed cars for the masses it doesn’t do – yet.  True, the supermarket chain bravely tried several decades ago, but its then revolutionary Asdadrive project crashed and burned, largely because it was way ahead of its time. Since then, that Interweb thing has taken over and massively altered the world, where consumers are happy to order goods unseen from reputable outlets’ websites.  • How and where to buy a new car Back in the mid-eighties, the Asdadrive experiment suffered inventory and space problems as its cars stole valuable customer car parking bays that were required to display the mass-produced vehicles it was trying to sell. But now Internet-based shopping is the norm for many folk, non-franchised retailers of cars don’t need to have stock or great knowledge of the models they’re peddling to bargain-seekers, who usually know what they want and what they should pay. So the late 2010s and early 2020s are just right for Asdacars, or something similar. With vehicle manufacturers, their franchised dealers, plus Web-based specialist firms on one side and loyal, bargain-obsessed customers on the other, Asdacars could and should act as the go-between, the enabler, the facilitator. Give it time and I think it’ll happen.  • "Hyundai has been transforming how people buy cars" - Steve Fowler So why Asda and why not Sainsbury’s, Tesco or Morrison’s? Because Asda’s owned by Walmart. And this US-based retail giant has announced it’s saddling up with dealer groups and others as it moves into the car- selling business from 1 April. Customers will buy online via Walmart while at home or work or use in-store, self-op kiosks to place orders – with some of Walmart’s 2.1 million workers on hand to assist. But while they’ll be able to click in-store, they’ll usually collect from dealerships.  It’s inconceivable this truly global chain will not broaden its car retailing operation to other countries, Britain included. A further twist is a leading car company CEO has just told me, off the record, that “I’m in discussions with a couple of parties on this, and will keep you posted”. Almost certainly, ‘Asdacars’ is one. The identity of the other is top secret. But I suspect not for much longer.   Would you consider buying a car online?

Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images Share Share Tweet Share Comment Email Print advertisement President Donald Trump convened with the heads of some of America's largest corporations on Friday at the White House for a meeting intended to make good on the administration's pledge to reduce regulation, promote women in the workplace, and cut taxes. Meeting with biggest business leaders this morning. Good jobs are coming back to U.S., health care and tax bills are being crafted NOW!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2017 Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric, told CNBC it had been a "fabulous meeting" and said the president "engaged forcefully" on every topic. Steve Schwarzman, CEO of private equity firm Blackstone and chairman of the council that arranged Friday's meeting, said the session had been "spirited intellectually" and that the members had had a "balanced discussion" about "taxes, trade, infrastructure, women's issues, education, and how to bring home jobs in terms of training people in technology." Other attendees at Friday's business huddle included members of Trump's economic advisory council, such as JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon, Walt Disney's Bob Iger, Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon, and Mary Barra of General Motors. The meeting also included First Daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, senior adviser to the president; as well as Vice President Mike Pence and White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon. One notable absentee was Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who resigned from his spot on the president's council Thursday amid fierce backlash from customers furious at Kalanick's seeming connection to Trump's controversial immigration ban that limits travel to America from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Kalanick said Thursday that his participation on Trump's council was not meant to be construed as any endorsement of Trump's policies. However, billionaire inventor and environmentalist Elon Musk, also heavily criticized for his position on the board due to seemingly contradictory stances with Trump, has not shied away from his role. In contrast to Kalanick, Musk tweeted a message on Thursday explaining that he was remaining on the board in order to "serve the greater good." Regarding the meeting at the White House: pic.twitter.com/8b1XH4oW6h— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 3, 2017 Corporate America is struggling to please an increasing divide: Customers and investors who oppose Trump's hard-line policies, and those who applaud his strong-arm techniques. And many business leaders on the president's council are stuck between a rock and a hard place as they seek to advise — or at least appease — the president while remaining firm on their own values and satisfying those of their client base. Related: Many CEOs 'Scared Out of Their Minds', Won't Speak Out Against Trump Trump has already called out several major companies via Twitter, including General Motors, L.L. Bean, and Ford. In December, he tweeted, "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" Following his tweet, Boeing stocks slid by more than 1 percent in premarket trade.

The bill approved by the House on a 54-46 vote would also require Amazon and other out-of-state companies without a physical presence in Arkansas to provide a list to finance officials of purchases made by state residents. The measure now heads to the Senate, which a day earlier approved another measure that would require Amazon and similar companies to begin collecting state sales tax. Arkansas is one of a handful of states where Amazon doesn't have a distribution center or office and doesn't collect sales taxes. "Main Street in Arkansas today is bleeding, and they're bleeding because they're at a disadvantage to the online retailers who have chosen to do business in this state," Republican Rep. Dan Douglas said before the vote. To avoid collecting taxes, Amazon has historically relied on another high court ruling that predates the era of online shopping. That 1992 decision bans states from forcing out-of-state retailers to collect taxes if they don't have a physical presence in the state. Douglas' bill is modeled after a Colorado law that the U.S. Supreme Court let stand last year. Amazon declined to comment on the House measure. The efforts to recover money from the company have the backing of Bentonville-based Wal-Mart, but are opposed by conservative groups such as Americans for Tax Reform. Opponents have said the move would increase the tax burden on the state's residents. "When you put this on their back, they are going to feel it," Republican Rep. Bob Ballinger said before the vote. Douglas and other supporters of the proposals have said the tax revenue from Amazon could help pay for additional income tax cuts. Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson last week signed legislation cutting income taxes by $50 million and forming a task force to recommend deeper reductions before the 2019 session. ——— Follow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ademillo 0 Shares Email Star Comments Arkansas House Passes Bill Aimed at Collecting Amazon Taxes " What's Next in the Legal Battle Over Trump's Immigration Plan " Dylann Roof's Lawyers Look to Have Death Penalty Tossed " Powerful Quake Kills at Least 6 in Southern Philippines " Obama Hires Agency for Speaking Gigs, Lawyers for Book Deals " American Airlines Pilots Say CEO Should've Met With Trump " Detroit Tigers, Red Wings Owner Mike Ilitch Dies at Age 87 " Trump Revives Voter Fraud Claims in Lunch With Senators " NFL More Forceful on Texas 'Bathroom Bill' After Super Bowl " Residents Say 1st Atom Bomb Test Caused Cancer Cases " Museum Shuts Down Shia LaBeouf's Protest Project Over 'Safety Hazards' " Trump: 'Good Chemistry' With Japan’s Leader, 'Getting Along Very Well' With China " Inside Trump's Relationship With Japanese Prime Minister Abe " The US's One-China Policy Explained " Larry Birkhead on What Anna Nicole Smith Was Really Like " Anna Nicole Smith's Daughter 'Fearless Like Her Mom' " Olympic Ghost Town: Bills Due, Venues Empty After Rio Games " Sacrificing California Spillway May Avoid Emergency Releases " How This Polyamorous Couple Plans to Celebrate Valentine's Day " Ryan Gosling Was Prepared to 'Defend' Oscar-Nominated 'La La Land' " Dance Moves for Women Scientifically Proven to Be Sexy

The immediate result of that would be a fierce trade war that America would almost certainly lose. And while we don’t know yet whether Trump will follow through with this threat, his abandonment of the Trans Pacific Partnership in his first few days in office is an indication that he is not shying away from his campaign pledges. Trump is now entering uncharted waters. He has already demonstrated his ignorance of Asian affairs when he publicly accepted a phone call from Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, in December, and shortly afterwards announced that he didn’t understand the “One China” policy, or why he should respect it. His abandonment of the TPP will simply accelerate China’s displacement of America as the world’s leading economic power. For the moment, China has decided to wait for the US to make the first move. A trade war would be problematic for the region, not least for South East Asia, which would be most likely to suffer negative fallout as a major trade partner to both the US and to China. But it would not be a disaster for China, mainly because the US needs China more than vice versa. Unfortunately for Trump, it’s not the 80s anymore. Twenty years ago, the situation might have been different. China was dramatically underdeveloped, and it wanted access to Western technology and manufacturing techniques. China has most of what it needs now, and what it doesn’t have it can easily obtain from vendors outside the US. While the American market looked enticing a few decades ago, it is relatively mature, and today the newer emerging market countries have become much more interesting to Beijing. The fastest growing markets for the best items China produces, like laptop computers and cell phones, are in developing regions such as India, Latin America, and Africa. In contrast, China itself is a market that the US can hardly ignore. By the end of 2015, Chinese consumers had bought 131 million iPhones. The total sales to the US customers during the same period stood at only 110 million. And iPhones are only a small part of the US exports. Boeing, which employs 150,000 workers in the US, estimates that China will buy some 6,810 airplanes over the next 20 years, and that market alone will be worth more than $1 trillion. Were Trump to start a trade war, the most immediate effects would probably be felt by companies like Walmart, which import billions of dollars of cheap goods that are bought mostly by the people who voted Trump into office. The prices on almost all of these items would quickly skyrocket beyond the reach of the lower economic brackets—not because of manufacturing costs, but because of the tariffs. The result would be an economic war of attrition that China is infinitely better positioned to win. China’s foreign currency reserves now stand at more than $3 trillion. In contrast, the US has foreign exchange reserves that hover at around $120 billion. Trump’s tariffs would automatically trigger penalties against the US in the World Trade Organisation, and may even lead to the WTO’s collapse, which would lead to higher tariffs against the US exports. While it may take a while for that to happen, the turmoil would be catastrophic for American business and employment. China, on the other hand, would emerge relatively unscathed. In fact, the importance of the US-China relationship is already being challenged by other players. Apple’s iPhone sales in China are running into competition from local Chinese manufacturers, and Samsung is more than happy to fill any void that the Chinese can’t deal with. Likewise, the Chinese would happily shift their trillion dollars in future aircraft purchases to Airbus, a European firm that is already building a plant in China to finish assembly of large, twin-aisle jets. As for automobiles, most Chinese would just as soon drive a Mercedes, BMW, or Lexus as a Ford. Both China and leading economic experts hope that a trade war won’t happen. The American political system is relatively mature with checks and balances, but with a president who often acts uniquely based on his own beliefs regarding complex issues, almost anything is possible.
