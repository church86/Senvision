Could Jet.com be any different? Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Aug 24, 2016 at 6:11PM Image Source: Wal-Mart. In 2010, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) acquired Vudu, a "leading provider" of video streaming technology. At the time, Wal-Mart called Vudu a "revolutionary service" that had licensing agreements with every major studio that allowed its streaming customers to rent or purchase as many as 16,000 movies. This was at the dawn of streaming, before Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) had split its own streaming service from its DVD-by-mail-plan and before Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) made its own significant push into streaming by bundling its video service with its Prime membership program. Analysts suspected the move could help Wal-Mart sell more internet-connected TV's, but it was not the retailer's first attempt to break into the entertainment market. In 2004, the company launched its own digital music download store, which flopped, and in 2007 it started a similar video download service with Hewlett-Packard, but that was gone within a year. Unlike Amazon Video or Netflix, Vudu hasn't gone on to bigger things in the streaming arena, despite the backing of the world's largest retailer. Wal-Mart only spent a little more than $100 million on the service, but it arguably could have been a tentpole similar to Amazon's on video service in its Prime membership. Instead, the service is an afterthought, barely worth a mention in Wal-Mart's 10-K report. Unlike Netflix, Amazon, or Hulu, Vudu offers no monthly subscription, making it a poor value when single movie rentals cost as much as $6. (Mis)adventures in China In 2011, Wal-Mart invested in Yihaodian, a fast-growing Chinese e-commerce business. Like many American companies, Wal-Mart saw the opportunity in China, predicting that e-commerce sales in that country would overtake those in the U.S. within a few years. Over the years, Wal-Mart upped its stake in Yihaodian, taking majority ownership in 2012 and eventually taking over the entire company last year. Less than a year after it took full control of Yihaodian, Wal-Mart sold it to JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) this past June. Wal-Mart received a 5% stake in JD.com, which was roughly $1.5 billion at the time of the sale, close to Yihaodian's valuation last year when Wal-Mart bought the remaining 49% of it. While the deal gives Wal-Mart a stake in one of China's biggest e-commerce players and it will provide for Wal-Mart's namesake brand and Sam's Club, it was seen by most analysts as giving up on the competitive Chinese market that is often difficult for American companies to penetrate. More broadly, Wal-Mart's traffic in Chinese stores has fallen for several quarters in a row. While Yihaodian's sale to JD doesn't represent a failure in and of itself, it does seem that Wal-Mart's original strategy with that business did not pan out. Similarly, WalmartLabs, the company's tech division located in Silicon Valley has had mixed result despite making 15 acquisitions in its history. With Jet.com, Wal-Mart is making its bet on e-commerce growth through another company, spending $3.3 billion. This tidy sum is the biggest amount spent, ever, to acquire an e-commerce business. And it is being spent on a company that has existed for less than a year.  By acquiring Jet, Walmart  gains technology and an appealing algorithm. It also gets the brain of Marc Lore, the founder who had previously started Quidsi, the parent of Diapers.com, a company that Wal-Mart coveted but Amazon ultimately bought. However, even before the acquisition, there were signs that such a partnership might not work out, and get saddled by the same bureaucracy that have troubled the company's other acquisitions. Discussing his own company and the pattern of other tech founders leaving Wal-Mart shortly after their company is acquired, he said in January, "If someone is unhappy here and doesn't see an opportunity for growth, OK, good luck, go to Wal-Mart. I want to prove to myself that a different kind of culture can work and that you don't have to be like that to be successful." Lore committed to run Wal-Mart's e-commerce division for five years, an unusually long time, and he would forfeit millions of dollars by quitting early. The question for Wal-Mart now is if it's willing to let its online division be run like a disruptive start-up even if that could mean undermining its own retail empire. The answer this question will likely determine the fate of Jet.com as part of WMT's empire. Unfortunately, if history is any guide, invests shouldn't hold their breath.  Jeremy Bowman owns shares of Netflix. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Amazon.com and Netflix.

Ibrahim Nathaniel Muhammad, 20, was charged with murder in the death of Rechard Delane Mickle. Kedar Aziz Muhammad, 22, was also charged with murder in Mickle's death. RELATED: Man charged with murder in Charlotte Walmart parking lot shooting Saturday, Charlotte-Mecklenburg police were called to the Walmart in the 8100 block of South Tryon Street at 9 p.m. in reference to a shooting. When officers arrived, they reportedly only found an abandoned vehicle. At that point, no one had been taken to area hospitals. A few hours later, Mount Holly police called CMPD and said a man, later identified as Mickle, had been dropped off at CaroMont Regional Medical Center with gunshot wounds. He was pronounced dead at the hospital. Police said evidence led them to believe Mickle was shot in the Walmart parking lot hours before. Anyone with further information about the incident is asked to call 704-432-TIPS, or Crime Stoppers at 704-334-1600. Copyright 2016 WBTV. All rights reserved.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:30 AM, August 25, 2016 Updated: 6:10 AM, August 25, 2016 NEW YORK - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday said cash-strapped Puerto Rico cannot force Wal-Mart Stores Inc's <WMT.N> affiliate on the island to pay a special corporate tax that the retailer claimed was discriminatory and violated the U.S. Constitution. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston upheld a lower court order blocking Puerto Rico from imposing its alternative minimum tax against Wal-Mart Puerto Rico Inc. The decision complicates the U.S. territory's efforts to reduce a $70 billion debt load and restart an economy that has been stalled for a decade with a 45 percent poverty rate. The 2015 tax legislation had raised to 6.5 percent from 2.0 percent the tax for on-island companies with more than $2.75 billion in revenues that buy goods from off-island "related parties." Wal-Mart argued it was the only company that fit that description and effectively taxed on items from its own distribution centers but not those bought from Puerto Rican vendors. A federal court in Puerto Rico sided with Wal-Mart in March. On Wednesday, the appeals panel called the tax "facially discriminatory," saying it taxes only cross-border transactions between a Puerto Rico corporate taxpayer and a related entity located elsewhere. This violated the so-called "dormant" Commerce Clause in the constitution, the court ruled. "Because we want to remain in business in Puerto Rico and to be part of the solution to the current fiscal crisis, we are grateful that the First Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision to strike down this unconstitutional tax," Lorenzo Lopez, a Wal-Mart spokesman said in a statement emailed to Reuters. Puerto Rico's financial problems, spurred by years of borrowing to try to combat economic stagnation, reached a crisis in recent months, as cash reserves dwindled and the island's own fiscal agent, the Government Development Bank, faced insolvency. In July, the territory defaulted on $779 million of its most senior debt. The appeals court admitted Puerto Rico is in "dire financial straits," but called the tax "blunt and unnecessarily over-inclusive." "It essentially establishes an irrebuttable presumption that all inter-corporate transfers to a Puerto Rico branch from related mainland entities are fraudulently priced to evade taxes," the court reasoned. The island's outgoing governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, has called Puerto Rico's financial situation a "humanitarian crisis," while U.S. Congress earlier this year passed legislation bringing the island's finances under a federal oversight board. Board members are expected to be appointed in September. Among the board's powers is the ability to force talks between the island and its creditors to negotiate cuts to Puerto Rico's debt.

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next NASHVILLE, Tenn. - Police say they have recovered marijuana plants growing behind a local Walmart. Four weed plants were found in the woods behind the Walmart in the 3400 block of Dickerson Pike. Officials could be seen coming from the tree line with the plants after removing them. According to police, a team of contractors found them while working in the field. A security guard with them was also a former police officer. He recognized the plants were marijuana and contacted police. Some Walmart employees said they've seen kids in the field before. The Metro Nashville Police Department sent an aviation team to check for a massive grow operation from the air. So far, authorities said they've only found four plants, and no arrests have been made.

Markowski, 58, appears for his preliminary hearing on Wednesday. He is accused of shooting at a state trooper after robbing the Shrewsbury Walmart. (Steve Marroni/PennLive) Print Email Steve Marroni | smarroni@pennlive.com By Steve Marroni | smarroni@pennlive.com The Patriot-News Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 24, 2016 at 4:11 PM, updated August 24, 2016 at 4:38 PM comments NEW FREEDOM – "He doesn't need a prescription," Terry Lee White told the pharmacist as she rushed to the back of the store. "He has a gun." She likely thought she'd never utter that sentence, especially in reference to a regular customer at the Shrewsbury Walmart, but she testified on Wednesday that's what happened when Thomas A. Markowski, 58, came up to her pharmacy window on April 7.   Thomas A. Markowski. York County Prison.   All charges have been bound over to York County Court after a preliminary hearing Wednesday for Markowski, whom police say used a sawed-off shotgun to rob the Walmart pharmacy of Fentanyl before shooting at a state trooper on his way out. According to testimony at Wednesday's hearing in New Freedom, the incident occurred like this: White was working at the Shrewsbury Walmart's pharmacy counter when Markowski, who was riding one of the store's motorized carts, came up to the window. It seemed like he was struggling, and he told her, "I'm dying" and "I need my Fentanyl patches." When she asked for his prescription, he told her he had a gun. Walmart robbery suspect accused of shooting at state trooper appears in court "He said I have 10 seconds to retrieve the Fentanyl," White testified. As she went back to talk to the pharmacist, a cashier, Stuart Wiener, heard the commotion and called 911. Markowski stuck his arm behind the counter, telling White she was moving too slowly, and started counting down from five. As she went back to the counter with the patches, she saw he was holding what appeared to be a sawed-off shotgun inside a black garbage bag. She gave him four boxes of Fentanyl and said, "now go." He got up from the motorized cart and started to walk out of the store. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Darrio Parham happened to be in his cruiser, parked at the Walmart, grabbing a bite to eat. It's customary for troopers to park there sometimes as a deterrent to potential shoplifters, he said.  Parham had only been on the job for about five months at that point when the 911 call came through.  At first, Parham thought the suspect had a knife, and he walked to the front of the store as Markowski was coming out, carrying the shotgun. "He was pointing it straight at me," Parham testified. Wiener was there, too, and he said Markowski was telling them to get out of his way.   As Markowski approached, Parham grabbed the shotgun, which went off. It was unclear if it was an accidental discharge or if Markowski intended to fire at the officer, but Parham drew his gun and shot Markowski in the chest. The shotgun blast hit the wall about 6-feet above Wiener's head. Senior Judge Nancy Lee Edie found there was enough evidence to send all charges against Markowski to York County Court, where he is set for arraignment on Sept. 30. He's facing charges of criminal attempt at the murder of a law enforcement officer, robbery, theft, possession of a weapon, recklessly endangering another person, assault of a law enforcement officer and two counts of aggravated assault. But even after the hearing, one question still remained – who is Thomas Markowski? "That's the thing, we don't know," York County Chief Deputy Prosecutor David Sunday said. It's not even clear where he lived. In requesting bail, Markowski's attorney, Ron Jackson, only had a partial Annapolis, Maryland address, as well as an address at a farm in another part of Maryland. Markowski is listed as living in York in charging documents, but he told the court he lived in Maryland all his life. The judge granted Markowski $2 million bail.  But there are still a lot of unknowns about what happened, who he is, and what led to the incident. Sunday said it's not even clear, at this point, if he has a terminal illness, as he had told the pharmacy tech.  PENNLIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA Facebook Twitter Instagram Pinterest Tumblr Most Read Active Discussions Get 'Today's Front Page' in your inbox This newsletter is sent every morning at 6 a.m. and includes the morning's top stories, a full list of obituaries, links to comics and puzzles and the most recent news, sports and entertainment headlines.

Home White Papers Webinars Software Directory Events Calendar About Us Editorial Calendar Contact Us Advertise Here About Us Editorial Calendar Contact Us Advertise Here Channels Featured Products White Papers Webinars Software Directory Events Channels Customer Experience Digital Experience DAM Digital Workplace SharePoint & Office 365 Web CMS Mobile Document Mgt The Digital Dash: Strategies to Keep Pace With Your Customers By David Aponovich | Aug 24, 2016 CHANNEL: Digital Experience This was the summer of e-commerce shakeups.  Walmart bought online retailer Jet.com for $3 billion to boost e-commerce and grab more share of consumers’ wallets.  And Macy’s announced the closing of 100 of its 675 stores as it deals with weak sales in many locations.  Scrambling for Sales A statement from incoming CEO Jeff Gennette said the decision represents "an advancement in our thinking on the role of stores.”  What he meant is that brick and mortar’s value has dropped significantly, and it can’t stand alone in a world gone digital. The real estate at 100 stores is now worth more to shareholders than selling suits, shoes and perfume. Those are just the two latest store-closure standouts in an industry where digital, new competition and shoppers’ changing tastes are making life hard. Sports Authority is going out of business, shutting everything down fast. Teen clothing store Aeropostale filed Chapter 11 and is closing hundreds of stores. Walmart specifically realizes it’s a race to meet consumers online: web, mobile, Amazon Echo — whatever and wherever the shoppers are.  But Amazon keeps eating away at Walmart’s base and its physical stores are losing steam. Earlier this year, the retailer said it would close 250 stores. After the Jet.com deal, the Economist reported, “Walmart still accounts for a tenth of American retail sales, but that has declined from 11.6 percent in 2009, according to Cowen Group, a financial-services firm.” Pinpointing the Problem When organizations fall behind digitally, the problem is often largely an organizational one, with some technology issues thrown into the mix, too.  Many companies — and their leadership — still live in a Kodachrome world where they control the conversation, dominate the market and set the trends. That legacy mindset can kill a company today. And when retailers wait too long to embrace digital transformation, once reality sets in, it’s hard to scrape your way back to customers’ hearts and minds. To understand the pattern here, just look at the newspaper industry.  For years, newspapers enjoyed consistent growth, high profits and near-monopolies in local markets for news and advertising. Then, industry leaders failed to recognize the web’s position as a force that would disrupt, and ultimately destroy, their old business model. I spent seven years in the newspaper business and was there the day the web showed up. Papers have been looking for their silver bullet ever since. Digital disruption is also happening in cable television, where customers are cutting the cord in favor of Netflix, Hulu and other less costly, more appealing subscriptions. TV isn’t as bad off as newspapers, but it’s on its way. Customers Are One Step Ahead Today’s customers are in control of your business — not the other way around — and the digital-induced threat is more prevalent than ever. It doesn’t matter if you’re in financial services, media and entertainment, or even higher education: customers are shifting their actions toward digital more rapidly than most of us ever expected. All these years after the web came onto the scene, too few organizations are truly, radically geared to move as fast as their customers, who are changing behaviors and transitioning their purchase power to an online world. And too many organizational leaders are telling their investors and boards that they’ve been doing the right things — that the business’ approach to digital is under control when the tail has been wagging the dog for a long time. The reality is, websites and mobile apps built only two years ago are just scratching the surface of digital customer engagement. They don’t account for things like social media engagement, digital signage, real-time notifications and proactive alerts that present an offer, update relevant information and news, or predict a customer’s next purchase. Lessons from the Leaders When it comes to digital disruption and digital customer experience, leading C-level executives are starting to take notice. Forward-thinking organizations are investing in tools, technology and strategy to get ahead and stay in the game: Hotel chains like Starwood are learning that great digital customer experiences, efficient online booking engines and phone apps that can unlock your hotel room door generate loyalty and more revenue per room Online banks like Chime and Simple that cater to the digital and mobile-savvy set are seeing millennials flocking to open accounts, invest their money and obtain loans Disruptive CPG brands, like digital direct-to-consumer Dollar Shave Club, used lower prices and great customer service to build a massive customer base that loved their products. Consumer goods giant Unilever loved it so much — and realized it could not replicate Dollar Shave Club’s success easily — that it recently paid $1 billion for the company Digital Is Just Business Digital has created a whole new world and a whole new level of expectations. Organizations require vision and permission from executives and boards of directors to try new approaches and take a few risks. They need funding to build in the right capabilities for ongoing digital innovation to win, serve and retain customers. Now, more than ever, getting that support is well worth the uphill battle. Digital isn’t just a fad. Digital business is now just “business.”  Organizations that realize this and build a strategy and digital technology platform to keep up with customers and stakeholders have a fighting chance when that disruptive competitor shows up on the scene.  Customers’ changing habits can move mountains. It’s time we learn to anticipate those moves and be ready when they show up, expecting the best from their digital experience.

(NYSE:WMT) has announced to review its merchandise procured from a major textile supplier after its rival Target Corporation also severs ties. The company says that it is analyzing Welspun India Ltd.’s cotton certification records after Target pulled back all its cotton sheets over Egyptian cotton dispute. Target had claimed that the supplier sent counterfeit Egyptian cotton sheets. Wal-Mart has now joined its competitor in scrutinizing Welspun over concerns that the Indian textile manufacturing giant may have sent in cheaper bed sheets that it marketed and passed off as premium Egyptian version. The longer fiber cotton dubbed as Egyptian forms a softer thread compared to other types of cotton. It is also sold at a much higher price, owing to its premium status and higher quality. The retail giant has plans to undertake further talks with the supplier to see how it can handle any issues discovered appropriately. While Target is the second largest customer for Welspun, Wal-Mart happens to be the third largest. Target announced last week that it has ended all business with the supplier and halted the sale of all pillow cases and bed sheets from both, its outlets and online platforms, after its investigation confirmed fears of deception. Because the two retailers are one of its largest customers, any business lost from them is badly going to affect the supplier’s sales for the year. Target generated almost $90 million of the company’s total annual sales for the year 2016 that ended in March. It ascribed to nearly 10% of the total sales made for the year. Bed Bath & Beyond on the other hand is the supplier’s largest customer and along with Walmart, it markets and sells Crowning Touch sheets online.At this time, the supplier has been talking about being on track to reach its goal of $2 billion in top line by the year 2020. If Walmart’s investigation confirms cotton being counterfeit, it may lose business with the retail giant. This makes its long-term goal quite a challenge to achieve. It is also likely that other customers such as BBBY may also begin raising questions over Welspun’s supplies. The company is currently making rugs, sheets, towels, and carpets for nearly 18 of world’s best 30 retailers. Hence, the litigation battle with Target combined with Wal-Mart’s scrutiny has pushed the stock of Welspun India—one of the largest textile manufacturers in the world—to slump by 36% in just two days at the Indian Mumbai stock exchange. According to Bloomberg, the two-day slide worth 36% is the worst the company has ever been stooped down since 1999. It has brought its market cap to just $990 million (66.2 billion rupees), down from over $1300 million just the week before. Welspun is part of a conglomerate worth $3 billion that is currently led by Balkrishan Goenka having interests and business that spans a multitude of industries such as energy, pipes, textiles, steel, and physical infrastructure. The company claims to have made “every fifth towel” that is marketed and sold in America. Its list of competitors includes apparel retailers such as Macy’s Inc. and J C Penney Company Inc. The textile giant hopes to become one of top 50 Indian industrial groups in market value in four years. As the company faces backlash from two of its largest customers, it has itself begun the review of its supply chain and quality control departments. It has hired one of the “big four” accounting and audit firms to analyze this process. The company has engaged with key customers to cooperate with them if anymore issues arise. Wal-Mart Can’t Afford Inventory Slipups The retail giant recently released upbeat results for second quarter (2Q) at time when it appear to be on track to recovery, it cannot afford to see any inventory mishaps over quality issues. Comparable store sales growth for the 2Q came in at 1.6% as opposed to its own forecast of 1%. The boost has led to a two-year stacked growth rate of 3.1%, up from 2.1% growth in 1Q of fiscal 2016. Sam’s Club reported comps growth of 0.6% (without fuel), which was in line with guidance of “slightly positive.” The 1.6% increase in US comps comprised 1.2% traffic growth, slightly down from 1.5% in the 1Q, but flat at 2.5% when measured on a two-year stacked basis. Average ticket also improved growing 0.4% from the 0.5% decline in the 1Q of fiscal 2016. This is the eighth consecutive positive comps increase for Walmart US and seventh consecutive positive traffic increase. Inventory continues to be a major focus for Walmart US and as it sees material improvement, the company should focus on its quality control so as to ensure high-quality products reach its end consumers. Hence, the investigation lies aligned with the retailer’s goal of offering the best at the most affordable price while keeping customer satisfaction on an upward trend.

Rachel Aldrich Aug 23, 2016 9:41 AM EDT NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Walmart (WMT) were advancing in early-morning trade on Tuesday after the company began reviewing records for Welspun India, one of its bedsheet suppliers, Bloomberg reports. Walmart is investigating claims that the supplier has been selling cheaper bedsheets as premium Egyptian cotton. Last week, Target (TGT) pulled its Welspun products from shelves after discovering they were mislabeled. Target has terminated all business with the Indian supplier. Welspun manufactures one out of every five towels sold in the U.S. and sells to major customers like J.C. Penney (JCP) and Macy's (M), according to Bloomberg. Walmart will be looking into Welspun's cotton certification records. The Bentonville, AR-based retail giant plans to wait on further discussions with the supplier and will "handle it appropriately" if issues are uncovered, according to a spokesperson cited by Bloomberg. Separately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its "risk-adjusted" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author. TheStreet Ratings rated this stock as a "buy" with a ratings score of B+. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, increase in net income, revenue growth, good cash flow from operations and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows low profit margins.

Those transactions follow $104 million of sales at the end of June at prices between $70.67 and $71.86. Shares of the retailer have climbed this year after closing at a four-year low of $56.42 in November. Seventy-seven percent of analysts tracked by Bloomberg have a hold rating on the stock, with an average 12-month price target of $73.68. Walton Enterprises LLC, the family’s main investment entity, distributed about 6 percent of the shares to the trust in April 2015. The family said in a statement that it expects to sell shares from time to time to help fund charitable contributions and offset possible further increases in its ownership percentage as a result of the company’s stock buyback programs. The trust now owns about 170 million shares of the business, the filings show. That’s a fraction of the 1.4 billion shares held by Walton Enterprises. Together the two entities own 51 percent of the retailer. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart and the Walton family directed Bloomberg to the April 2015 statement.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Walmart is 'going on the offensive' as growing threat Kroger slashes prices and hires thousands of workers Wednesday Aug 24, 2016 at 12:03 PM Ashley Lutz Business Insider Kroger is slashing prices and going on a hiring spree.  The grocery store chain recently cut the cost of 1,000 popular items in 120 of its stores, retail consultant David Merrefield writes on industry website The Robin Report. It's also in the process of hiring 14,000 people at its 2,800 stores to boost customer service.  Kroger has annual sales of $115 billion, about half of Walmart's US sales. Still, the retail giant is starting to pay attention.  Walmart is reacting to Kroger's success by investing more heavily in its grocery experience, the Cincinnati Business Courier reports. Walmart is now expanding grocery ordering and pick-up similar to Kroger's popular "Clicklist" service.  "Walmart is going on the offensive," Jim Hagerty, a principal and investment adviser with money management firm Bartlett & Co., told the Business Courier.  Kroger has stores in 35 states, making it Walmart's top grocery store competitor. Lately, Kroger's executives have been focused on offering more private-label products and cutting unpopular items so they can slash prices and hire more people.  "Kroger has been able to come close enough to Walmart’s pricing structure to remain competitive, outperforming any of its industry peers," Merrefield writes. The grocery chain has posted same-store sales gains for the past 50 consecutive quarters.  In addition to cutting prices and shoring up the staff, Kroger is also stocking up on organic food and building stores to rival Whole Foods.  The Kroger Marketplace concept features anything you would find in a Walmart or Target store, but also includes gourmet and prepared foods and alcohol similar to a Whole Foods store.  Business Insider recently toured a Kroger Marketplace store and found customizable gourmet pizzas and craft beers on tap.  NOW WATCH: Forget the gross factor: There are serious health reasons for why you shouldn't pick your nose See Also:Chipotle might be wasting millions of dollars on free foodWalmart beats on earnings, raises guidanceHere's the brutal presentation that an activist investor just published about Buffalo Wild Wings SEE ALSO: Kroger has a new plan that should terrify Walmart and Target Follow Us: On Facebook About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Contact Us Subscribe Yellow Pages Vacation Hold Market Place Classifieds Find Independence jobs Cars Real Estate FindNSave Boats Magazine Online Submissions Engagements Weddings Births Anniversaries Sister Publication Boonville Daily News Linn County Leader Lake Sun Leader Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune The Examiner Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

India obsessions our picks latest popular like us on facebook follow us on twitter quartz index about us register log in log out Events Atlas quartz quartz India quartz Africa Change your edition back to menu QUALITY CONTROL J.C. Penney, Bed, Bath and Beyond and Walmart start investigating Indian firm after Target cuts ties Written by Madhura Karnik August 24, 2016 Quartz india Are those sheets you bought? (Reuters/Natalie Behring) Share Written by Madhura Karnik August 24, 2016 Quartz india For textile maker Welspun India, it’s been a tough few days–and they will likely get tougher. Shares of the Mumbai, India, firm have dropped 43% in the last seven days on the BSE after American retailer Target said it would drop the firm as a supplier because the Indian company substituted cheap cotton for 100% Egyptian cotton in sheets shipped under the Fieldcrest label. Now US retailers J.C. Penney, Bed, Bath and Beyond, and Walmart say they are investigating products supplied by the firm. New investigations “JCPenney is conducting a thorough investigation of its Welspun textiles to ensure the integrity of its product claims. It is too early in our review process to determine what actions may be necessary,” Carter English, a spokesperson for J.C. Penney, said in an email. Bed, Bath and Beyond, which is Welspun India’s biggest customer, has also initiated a review. “Welspun has reaffirmed to us that the Welspun product carried in our stores is Egyptian cotton. To further assure ourselves and our customers, we have engaged an independent third party to perform an audit of the supply chain to confirm this information,” said spokesperson Leah Drill in an email. Walmart told The Wall Street Journal that it is “reviewing” Welspun India’s certification records. Walmart hasn’t replied to an inquiry from Quartz. Macy’s, the American department-store chain, is also closely watching. “Welspun does produce some of Macy’s private brand products, but they are not 100% Egyptian cotton. Of course, we continue to monitor the situation,” Jim Sluzewski, a Macy’s spokesperson, said in an email. Some customers such as Swedish retailer Ikea aren’t discontinuing business with Welspun but are on alert. Ikea told Reuters that Welspun India is a supplier, and it hasn’t any issue with the quality. Ikea will monitor the situation, too. Analysts worry These retailers are critical for Welspun India. The Egyptian cotton sheets business accounts for about 6% of revenue at Welspun India, according to Elara Capital, a brokerage. One of the biggest textile makers in India, the firm gets 95% of its revenue from exports. Welspun India said it has commissioned an audit, but analysts said the company did not provide many details during a call on Aug. 23. The call “was vague on facts and threw up more questions than answers,” analysts at Elara wrote in a note. “(Welspun’s) management failed to assuage concerns on how Target’s internal audit and third-party quality checks appointed by it failed to raise any alarms over a period of two years,” analysts Sumant Kumar and Anuja Barve wrote. They also estimate that Welspun India might have to pay a one-time penalty of between 1% and 2% of its total revenue. Elara has downgraded its rating on the stock to “sell.” Here’s the movement of Welspun India’s share price during the last week. Welspun hasn’t replied to an email seeking details from Quartz.

Posted 9:54 AM, August 24, 2016, by Tracy Bloom, Updated at 11:07pm, September 23, 2016 Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email A registered sex offender was arrested after allegedly taking cellphone video of a 10-year-old girl as she used the restroom inside a Walmart store in unincorporated El Cajon, the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department said Tuesday. The San Diego County Sheriff’s Department has released this booking photo of Robert Becker. The young victim told deputies a man followed her into the women’s bathroom last Wednesday at the Walmart located at 13487 Camino Canada, a sheriff’s news release stated. He then went into the stall next to her, took out his cellphone and used it to record her as he made lewd comments, the girl said, according to the release. The suspect, identified by the Sheriff’s Department as 21-year-old Robert Becker, left before deputies arrived. Investigators looked through the store’s surveillance video to identify him; Becker was arrested Monday at his Alpine home in the 4000 block of Alpine Boulevard, according to the release. His previous offense was described as possessing and controlling obscene matter depicting a minor in sexual conduct, according to his entry on the Megan’s Law website. The victims were under the age of 12 and authorities found more than 600 images. In the latest case, he faced charges of attempted lewd and lascivious acts on a minor, annoying or molesting a child with a prior conviction and disorderly lewd conduct. Becker possibly committed similar crimes in East County, prompting authorities to look for additional victims. Anyone with information about the case, and those who believe they have been victimized by Becker, are urged to call the department at 858-974-2417. Anonymous tips can also be left through Crime Stoppers by dialing 888-580-8477. 32.794773 -116.962527 Filed in: Local News Topics: Robert Becker, San Diego County Sheriff's Department, Walmart Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email KTLA 5 News on Facebook Popular Pregnant Woman Fatally Stabbed During Fight in Venice; 3 Attackers Sought Parent Says Tennessee School Bus Driver Asked Kids If They Were ‘Ready to Die’: Report Heartbreaking Video Shows Teacher Snatching Mic Away From West Virginia Boy With Autism at School Play New Federal Overtime Law Takes Effect Dec. 1, Will Impact Millions of U.S. Workers Latest News L.A.

(WMT) Turnaround Strategy Starting to Work WMT doesn't have to beat AMZN to thrive By Wayne Duggan, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Aug 24, 2016, 12:24 pm EST     Popular Posts: 3 Dividend Stocks to Buy No Matter What the Fed Does Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Quietly Set Itself Up for a HUGE Q4 3 Trump Stocks That Are All Trumped Out Recent Posts: 3 High-Dividend Stocks for 2017 and Beyond 3 Trump Stocks That Are All Trumped Out 3 Dividend Stocks to Buy No Matter What the Fed Does View All Posts A year ago, it seemed like Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) might end up just another victim of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s e-commerce dominance. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr However, as WMT’s second-quarter earnings report revealed, Walmart may not have to beat AMZN to thrive. Second Place Good Enough For WMT While there’s no denying the secular retail shift to e-commerce, AMZN isn’t necessarily the grim reaper for all traditional retailers. Walmart seems to be a perfect example. 7 Best Dividend Stocks You Haven’t Heard Of Other retailers like Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) and Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) are clearly struggling to figure out how to compete with AMZN. However, WMT just delivered positive overall sales growth, 3% U.S. sales growth, 1.6% same-store sales growth and 12% EPS growth. That is certainly not the kind of quarter you’d expect from a dying company. WMT stock is also trading near its 52-week high. Let’s be clear — Walmart is not beating Amazon. But that’s OK. “No one catches Amazon online,” Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea says. “The key is to be No. 2.” WMT’s online sales growth numbers were nowhere near AMZN’s numbers, but WMT still reported 11.8% digital sales growth in Q2. WMT Turning The Corner? One of the most difficult things for investors to identify is the exact inflection point when a struggling business turns the corner. WMT’s Q2 numbers seem to suggest that its turnaround strategy is working. But one quarter of good numbers is not a trend. WMT’s same-store sales growth of 1.6% is its strongest quarterly number since 2013. WMT’s online sales growth represents the first quarterly uptick following nine consecutive quarters of declines. Still, there are plenty of causes for concern. WMT’s U.K. operations remain a problem. Same-store sales in the U.K. plummeted 7.5% in Q2. Overall international sales were down 6.6%. Will Jet.com Be WMT’s E-Commerce Solution? Outside of WMT’s surprisingly upbeat Q2 earnings report, the biggest recent Walmart news has been a $3 billion buyout of Jet.com. Jet.com is only about a year old, but it has delivered impressive growth in that time. Jet.com’s sales have surged 168% from August 2015 to July 2016. Jet.com won’t be taking down Amazon anytime soon. However, it could be the key to Walmart establishing a solid number two position in the U.S. e-commerce market. First, Walmart added the creative vision of innovative Jet.com CEO Marc Lore. Forrester analyst Sucharita Mulpuru recently called Lore the biggest asset in Walmart’s acquisition. “What Walmart needs is an innovation machine that consistently is putting out something new every week,” Mulpuru added. Not only will Jet.com’s business model benefit from Walmart’s vendor relationships, Jet.com gives WMT something it has badly needed: an exciting e-commerce brand. Walmart has spent decades building one of the strongest brands in the world. However, that brand does not represent technology, e-commerce and innovation. No matter what the company does to make Walmart.com better, it will be very difficult for the site to compete with Amazon on reputation. Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA): The Boring Story You Shouldn’t Ignore Jet.com gives Walmart a blank state to get behind an exciting new brand that is synonymous with e-commerce. Jet.com may have gotten off to a late start in its quest to be the top Amazon alternative, but it now has the full weight of Walmart behind it. As of this writing, Wayne Duggan did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Walmart Worker Turns Herself In To Police After Accepting $1,000 In Movie Prop Cash Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Worker Turns Herself In To Police After Accepting $1,000 In Movie Prop Cash August 24, 2016 11:21 am EST By Chris Morran@themorrancave all about the bogus benjamins scams crime news georgia walmart counterfeit bills When a movie or TV show needs stacks of cash for a scene, they don’t usually withdraw millions from the bank and hope no one walks away with it. Instead, they use prop money that will pass for the real thing on camera, but that any cashier with eyes would immediately notice is fake. So when some Walmart shoppers in Georgia managed to buy $1,000 of stuff with fake movie money, police were suspicious about the cashier’s involvement. Police in Gwinnett County, GA, first heard of the movie prop money bandits — a man and a woman — earlier this month after they used ten fake $100 bills to purchase lawn equipment at a Walmart in the town of Buford. The scammers later returned their ill-gotten purchase at a different Walmart where they (presumably) received real cash in return. The Walmart cashier who accepted the funny money in the first place came under suspicion after she failed to return to work following the incident. Police say that the cashier knew the female scammer and had confronted her about money the scammer owed her before the male fraudster handed her the fake bills — clearly marked as for “Motion Picture Use Only” on both the front and the back. The 19-year-old cashier turned herself in to authorities on Tuesday afternoon. She and the other pair face first-degree forgery charges, while the couple are expected to face additional charges of theft-by-deception.

Toggle Navigation A-   A+ Sign in News   Stock Home «Back Walmart reviewing cotton certification records of Welspun Press Trust of India | New Delhi Aug 24, 2016 02:42 PM IST Global retail giant Walmart is reviewing cotton certification records of Welspun India in the wake of Target Corporation's decision to terminate contract with the Gujarat-based textiles maker over alleged lapses in products supplied to it. Confirming that Welspun supplies a number of products to Walmart, a spokesperson of the US retail major said: "We are currently reviewing Welspun cotton certification records and plan to have additional conversations with Welspun. If we discover an issue, we will handle it appropriately." The development follows Target Corp, which had after an extensive investigation, confirmed that Welspun that uses Egyptian cotton to make bedsheets and pillowcases sold by the retailer, substituted another type of non-Egyptian cotton when producing these sheets between August 2014 and July 2016. The retailer had said as soon as its investigation confirmed the substitution, it pulled all remaining product from Target stores and Target.Com. "We have informed Welspun that, due to this conduct, we are in the process of terminating our relationship with them," Target Corp said. Welspun on its part had said it has initiated immediate actions to investigate the root cause and was appointing an external auditor to audit its supply systems and processes. Shares of Welspun India were trading at Rs 59.30 on BSE post afternoon, down 9.95 per cent from previous close. The shares had crashed 19.99 per cent yesterday to Rs 65.85 - its lower circuit limit - on BSE.

Oanh Ha Welspun has lost as much as 43% of its market value this week, the worst performance among India’s top 200 companies. Hanoi: Welspun India Ltd shares tumbled by the daily limit for a third day as the controversy over the manufacturer passing off cheaper bed sheets as premium Egyptian cotton widened, with customers Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. now reviewing items to verify product claims. Shares dropped 10% on Wednesday to Rs.59.30 in Mumbai. The company has lost as much as 43% of its market value this week, the worst performance among India’s top 200 companies. J.C. Penney, the manufacturer’s fifth-biggest customer, said the company is reviewing its Welspun products. It’s too early to determine what actions the retailer might take, spokeswoman Daphne Avila said in an email Tuesday. Target said on 19 August it had pulled sheets and pillowcases off its shelves after discovering they were mislabeled as Egyptian cotton. It also terminated all business with the supplier. Part of a roughly $3 billion conglomerate headed by Balkrishan Goenka—with interests spanning textiles, steel, pipes, energy and infrastructure—Welspun now faces one of its worst crises since being founded 30 years ago. Welspun said it’s reviewing its supply chain and would hire a “Big Four” accounting firm to examine its processes. The company is engaging with key customers, managing director Rajesh Mandawewala said during a conference call Monday. The company manufactures every fifth towel sold in the US and counts Costco Wholesale Corp. and Macy’s Inc among its customers. Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, is reviewing Welspun’s cotton certification records and plans to hold further discussions with the manufacturer. The chain is also reviewing its other suppliers of Egyptian cotton products out of an abundance of caution, spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said Tuesday. Bloomberg K.

LaSandra McKeever will be featured in an upcoming edition of the Women of Distinction Magazine in 2016/2017. Beginning her career in retail as a Department Manager for Walmart Stores, Inc. in 2002, LaSandra McKeever was eager to transfer into a new field that would offer her the ability to grow and promote from within. As Department Manager, she received numerous awards and recognitions from corporate leaders at local, regional, and divisional levels for her performance and operational excellence. In 2004, she was offered an entry level position at the corporate office in Bentonville, Arkansas. McKeever knew that climbing the corporate ladder was going to take hard work and determination. Her passion provided her the strength to move both she and her son from southern Indiana to northwest Arkansas and continue her career. During her tenure with the organization, she learned the ins and outs from Store Operations and Merchandising to Logistics and Supply Chain. Her opportunities with the retail giant continued to blossom over the last 15 years and today she is serving as a Senior Planner of Import Demand for their US stores. "Working in retail is not easy," McKeever said. "It's not uncommon for me to put in 85-hour work weeks to get the job done, but I love what I do and the people I work alongside every day. It's been a blessing to be able to work for such a wonderful company with so much opportunity at my fingertips." In McKeever's role, she is responsible for performing import analysis and forecasting corporate sales demand to maintain healthy inventory levels in warehouses and stores to drive sales through product flow and availability. She must also ensure that the product the customers' desires are always available to them at all times. Serving an average of 260 million customers weekly around the world, maintaining product flow and availability are at the forefront. McKeever has been serving as the Director of Public Relations for the Moto Guzzi National Owners Club for nearly 10 years. It's a motorcycle club that is comprised of approximately 1,800 members who are predominantly men. She also serves as a Discussion Board Moderator for Wildguzzi.com, is active with various other professional organizations, and volunteers and participates for several events throughout the year that are near and dear to her heart. McKeever and her family reside in Southwest Missouri and it's her husband to whom she credits for having taught her the patience, integrity, and discipline to find a job that doesn't feel like work.

This stock hit lower circuit for 3rd day in a row, down 42% India Today 24-08-2016 Shares of Welspun India hit lower circuit for the third day in a row on Wednesday, as the fallout from Target Corp's decision to terminate business with the firm for passing off cheap sheets as premium Egyptian cotton escalated. After Target and Walmart, now JC Penney said it will investigate Welspun textiles product claims. The stock of the company plunged 10 per cent to Rs 59.30 on the BSE. The scrip has lost 42.24 per cent in last three days. Target said on Friday that it was severing ties with Welspun after its extensive investigation had confirmed that the Indian company, which purportedly used Egyptian cottons to make sheets and pillowcases sold to the retailer, substituted non-Egyptian cotton instead. Target is Welspun India's biggest customer after Bed Bath and Beyond. It accounted for about $90 million, or 10 percent of the company's total business in the financial year through March, Welspun executives said on a conference call on Monday. Welspun said on the call that it was investigating the product specification issue and would hire a Big Four accountancy firm to review its supply processes. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Welspun's third-biggest customer, is also reviewing the company's cotton certification records, the Wall Street Journal reported. A spokesman for Welspun said the company did not wish to comment on the reported Wal-Mart review. The US retail giant accounts for about 8 to 9 per cent of Welspun's revenues, according to Elara Capital analyst Sumant Kumar. "The risk is there as these are still early stages, so we need to wait and see," Kumar said. Sales of Egyptian cotton bedding account for only about 6 percent of Welspun's total sales, according to Kumar, but the loss to the company's credibility means other customers could withdraw all their business as Target has done. Analysts said Welspun did not provide clear answers during Monday's conference call, when asked whether other customers could follow Target's move to cut ties. "We are actively engaged with our clients," Welspun's Managing Director Rajesh Mandawewala said, in response to that query on the call. Kumar, in his note, said Welspun executives were vague on facts during the call, which threw up more questions than answers.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Not only is Walmart home to some truly odd creatures, but, it turns out, the big box retailer sells plenty of weird gadgets, too. We bought a few to see if they’re any good. I don’t mean weird in the sense that there are VCRs still sitting on store shelves (although I wouldn’t be surprised to find a location selling them). We scoped out the kind of technology any normal consumer would avoid, but for some reason Walmart still sells. Speakers that blast water to the beat? Reece’s-themed headphones? A $15 handheld camera that records Full HD? These are the type of gadgets you’d expect to find at a garage sale in the middle of nowhere. There is so much good (and affordable) technology out there (including at Walmart) that it’s almost offensive Walmart tries to hock these gadgets. As you might have guessed, a camera that’s just $15 isn’t very good (or very functional), and Reece’s-themed headphones shouldn’t be your go-to during a long commute. If you like a good bargain, indiscriminately choosing gadgets off the shelf at Walmart isn’t the smartest move. But we did it anyway, because why not? Check out the video above to see what we found.

The suspects used 10 motion picture $100 bills, according to authorities. Police say Sinquefield later returned the lawn equipment for cash at a different Walmart. Police: Cashier never returned to work According to authorities, Sinquefield confronted the cashier, Jocelyn Gerstenlauer, about an alleged personal debt prior to the purchase. Afterward, police say Sinquefield walked out of the store, which is when Taylor allegedly used the fake money to buy the equipment at Gerstenlauer's register.  Police say Gerstenlauer never returned to work after the fake money was found in her register.  Gerstenlauer turned herself into authorities around noon on August 23 and is being charged with first-degree forgery. She has since bonded out of jail. Sinquefield was booked into the Gwinnett County Jail on Thursday morning. She is charged with first-degree forgery, theft by deception and probation violation. Taylor is still wanted on charges of first-degree forgery and theft by deception.  Copyright 2016 WGCL-TV (Meredith Corporation).

The largest U.S. electronics retailer also raised its fiscal-year earnings outlook and reported a surprise increase in sales at stores open at least a year. The results bucked a string of weak performances in the electronics category by competitors like Target Corp (TGT.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and reflected Best Buy's resilience against larger online rival Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Best Buy reported a nearly 24 percent increase in online sales, whose share of domestic revenue has risen to 10.6 percent from 8.6 percent a year earlier. It said it benefited from faster shipping and improvements in the checkout process and search functionality. "Given the heavily promotional July environment due to Amazon's Prime Day and Walmart's steady diet of competing offers, Best Buy's online results stand out," Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea said. He estimated the company's online business at about $5 billion. Best Buy Chief Executive Officer Hubert Joly said that along with e-commerce investments, the retailer is focusing on improving employee retention and training "with a heightened focus on product knowledge and selling skills." During the second quarter ended on July 30, demand at Best Buy increased for items like home theaters and large appliances, categories where Target and Wal-Mart typically do not have a significant market share, according to analysts. Sales declined for mobile phones and gaming, where those rivals have a sizeable presence. Mobile phone sales have fallen industrywide due to a dearth of new products. Best Buy Chief Executive Officer Hubert Joly said he expected demand to increase this quarter and next as scheduled product introductions draw consumers. Apple Inc's APPL.O long-awaited iPhone 7 is set for availability next month. Last week, Target blamed its poor performance in part on lower sales of electronics due to a drop in demand for Apple products. Excluding special items, Best Buy's second-quarter earnings of 57 cents per share beat the analysts' average forecast of 43 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose slightly to $8.53 billion from a year earlier, snapping a three-quarter streak of declines and exceeding analysts' estimates of $8.40 billion. Sales at established stores increased 0.8 percent. Analysts had expected a 0.60 percent decline, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Best Buy said it expected low-single-digit percentage growth in fiscal-year operating income, compared with a previous forecast of "approximately flat" results. The company gave a third-quarter profit and revenue outlook roughly in line with analysts' estimates.

Morgan got to sit in the passenger seat of a Wal Mart 18-wheeler, and take a ride from the hospital all the way to the Clinton Wal Mart, flanked by Jackson Police. He helped to kick off a special campaign. The Children's Miracle Network is teaming with Batson Hospital and Wal Mart stores to conduct "Champion Child" patient transports. It's a great break for the children and Morgan says the trip was wonderful.  "I was talking to the driver about how he said he had been driving the truck for 45 years, and he's been to a lot of different Wal Marts, like in Pearl and Texas," Jordan said. Jordan's mother, Deborah Morgan, says it's been a big day for her son and she's proud of him.  Copyright 2016 MSNewsNow. All rights reserved.

With no truly compelling new device or essential piece of tech on the market for months, consumer electronics sales have been underwhelming. This is one of the reasons Target gave to explain declining sales: Electronics sales were down, with sales of Apple tech dipping a steep 20% in the second quarter of 2016. Given the “challenging environment” depicted by Target, most analysts were expecting Best Buy to post similarly poor earnings results this week. “Declining sales present a more formidable headwind,” Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter wrote recently of Best Buy, according to Investor’s Business Daily. “The expectations [for Best Buy] are muted partly because people are buying fewer consumer electronics,” the Wall Street Journal explained mere hours before the retailer released second quarter earnings. When the company did post surprisingly strong earnings on Tuesday, its stock price immediately shot up more than 15%. How did Best Buy do it? Well, part of the reason for Best Buy’s surging stock price is that expectations had been so low. Analysts had anticipated a 0.6% decrease in same-store sales, making the 0.8% second quarter increase seem particularly impressive. And what seems to have most impressed investors is that Best Buy has managed to cut costs while figuring out a way to compete well with Amazon and Walmart, particularly in terms of online sales. Read Next: How Walmart Is Surviving the War Against Amazon—and Beating Target “We saw continued positive momentum in our online sales – delivering a second straight quarter of nearly 24% growth. We also continued to deliver cost savings and drive efficiencies in the business, a discipline that is critical to our ability to invest in our future,” Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly said in a press release on Tuesday. “In what we characterize as a solid quarter, especially given the heavily-promotional July environment due to Amazon’s Prime Day and Walmart’s steady diet of competing offers, Best Buy’s online results really stand out,” said Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune. While this is good news for Best Buy (and potentially, investors), the results indicate that Target’s struggles may be even worse than people think. Target has been facing the same formidably strong headwinds as Best Buy, including major discounting from Amazon and Walmart, and Target’s efforts to compete have been coming up short. Analysts say that Target’s e-commerce department have long lagged behind the competition, and that its recent 16% online sales increase was actually pretty weak in the grand scheme. While Best Buy long ago established itself as an electronics specialist, and it has been able to boost online sales thanks to competitive pricing, faster shipping, and better product reviews and service, Target has remained an all-purpose retailer that doesn’t really stand out as exceptional in any key category. Read Next: Amazon Has Upper-Income Americans Wrapped Around Its Finger The company recently admitted it is “sitting in the middle of no man’s land” with its poorly performing grocery section, as the stories groceries tend to be not as cheap as Aldi or Walmart, and not as high-quality as Whole Foods or Wegmans. It appears as if Target is essentially in no man’s land in terms of electronics sales, and online sales in general, too. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Anne D'Innocenzio, AP Retail Writer Leave a comment 62 reads People leave Target’s downtown Minneapolis corporate headquarters Tuesday, March 10, 2015. (AP Photo/Star Tribune, Glen Stubbe/File) NEW YORK (AP) _ Target Corp. cut its profit forecast and a key sales outlook Wednesday as it saw fewer customers in its stores and acknowledged it didn’t push the second part of its “Expect More, Pay Less” slogan. The Minneapolis-based discounter’s second-quarter net income fell nearly 10 percent, though that was better than what most had expected. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 1.1 percent, reversing seven straight quarters of gains. Its main competitor, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., reports results Thursday. Target’s shares fell $4.74, or 6 percent, to $70.74 in afternoon trading. Customer traffic fell for the first time in a year and a half as Target struggled to get its grocery offerings right and shoppers looking for deals on essentials like detergent were turned off. Other issues, both company-specific and industrywide, ranged from a lack of new electronics for sale and lingering disruptions caused by the sale last year of its pharmacy business to CVS. Sales by markets also varied, with weakness on the East Coast but pockets of strength in California. “Our No. 1 focus is driving traffic back to our stores and accelerating business to our site,” Chief Executive Brian Cornell said. Target joins retailers such as department store chain Macy’s that are struggling with fewer customers coming in as shoppers buy more online. The bright spots in retail have been T.J. Maxx’s parent company TJX Cos. and Home Depot as consumers look for clothing bargains and focus more on their homes. Under Cornell, Target has been trying to reinvigorate itself restore its cheap-chic status after a series of headline-grabbing setbacks such as a 2013 data breach. It’s focusing on categories like fashion, home furnishings and wellness products, creating vignettes featuring home products and launching the children’s line Cat & Jack. But striking the right balance between stylish clothing and bedspreads while offering toothpaste and detergent at good prices has been tricky. “Our progress in apparel and home has been really significant,” said Cornell. “And we’ve got to make sure we never lose track of the other side of our brand promise and that’s the “Pay Less” side. And that’s all about those core household essentials that we have to make sure are presented effectively.” To boost sales and traffic, Target plans to increase marketing for its essentials and work with key vendors like Apple to push more innovation and to also improve presentations. Apple product sales were down 20 percent and the electronics department was a “significant drag,” Cornell said. Target is still struggling, however, to reinvent its food section _ an area where Wal-Mart is particularly strong. Grocery sales represent about 20 percent of Target’s total business but it has seen disappointing results from perishables like fruits and vegetables. Its nonperishable items have been doing well, and it’s marketing more organic, natural or gluten-free products. Yarbrough noted that Target faces stiff competition on the low end from Wal-Mart, which is focusing on lowering prices further, and at the high end from the likes of stores like Whole Foods and others. “Grocery is going to be more difficult to fix,” said Brian P. Yarbrough, a senior analyst at the Edward Jones investment firm, which downgraded Target’s stock to “hold” from a “buy” rating Wednesday. “They’re not a destination for food. They don’t offer a whole suite of products.” While nowhere near the online volume of Amazon, Target is expanding its online services. It’s doubling the number of stores that will be used to ship products directly to online shoppers’ homes, which will result in speedier deliveries. Online sales rose 16 percent in the second quarter, lower than the 23 percent gain in the first quarter. Target also is spending to modify some stores after an outcry from some customers about its policy of allowing transgender customers and staff to use the bathrooms that identifies with their gender identity. Chief financial officer Cathy Smith said the backlash hasn’t had a “material” impact on sales, but some customers are still upset. “We are listening to our guests,” she said. Target is investing $20 million in building single-stall bathrooms in stores. Target reported net income for the quarter of $680 million, or $1.16 per share. That compares with $753 million, or $1.18 per share, a year earlier. Adjusted per-share earnings were $1.23, beating projections of $1.14 from Wall Street, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research. Revenue fell 7 percent to $16.2 billion. The company now expects earnings this year from $4.80 to $5.20 per share, lower than the $5.20 to $5.40 it had projected earlier. Same-stores sales could fall as much as 2 percent in the second half of the year, Target said. ____ Follow Anne D’Innocenzio on Twitter at http://www.Twitter.com/adinnocenzio ___ Elements of this story were generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.

He weighed in at 605 pounds, and his doctor basically told him his life was in serious danger. So Pat decided to make a change. He lived about one mile from a Walmart, and he decided that every time he was hungry, he’d walk to Walmart, buy food, walk home, cook it, and eat. Quote, “You walk to Walmart three times a day, and you end up walking six miles.” And after the walk there, he’d be more inspired to buy healthier foods like lean meats, vegetables, sweet potatoes, or quinoa. Now, three years later . . . he weighs 279 pounds. He lost 326 pounds, or almost 110 pounds a year. For the first two years, he lost ALL the weight just walking to and from Walmart. Over the past year, he’s also walked on a treadmill and started lifting weights . . . and now he’s RIPPED. He went from 53% body fat to under 10%. And last week, he went through the final step of his transformation and had, quote, “several feet” of loose skin surgically removed.

(DG) Should Ride With the Bulls Wall Street is expecting a 15% jump in Dollar General earnings, but guidance could be key By Joseph Hargett, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Aug 23, 2016, 10:36 am EST     Popular Posts: Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc.

(T) 2 Ways to Collect on Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Tuesday’s Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), GoPro Inc (GPRO) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) View All Posts Dollar General Corp. (NYSE:DG) is having a stellar year, with DG stock up more than 25% since the start of 2016. The shares have a chance to add to that lead this week, as Dollar General heads to the earnings confessional to release its second-quarter earnings report. With DG stock hovering near technical support and oversold levels, Dollar General options traders should take a serious look. Currently, Wall Street is expecting second-quarter earnings to rise nearly 15% year-over-year to $1.09 per share, with revenue seen advancing 7.9% to $5.5 billion. Though the company sports smaller sized stores, Dollar General competes almost directly with retailing juggernaut Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT). 7 Best Dividend Stocks You Haven’t Heard Of While Walmart’s venture into the small-store market largely failed — and ended with Dollar General snapping up about 40 Walmart Express locations — the company’s recent earnings report hinted at product pricing moves that could impact DG stock’s guidance. That said, analysts don’t seem to be too worried about Walmart’s competition, with EarningsWhispers.com projecting a whisper number of $1.11 per share — two cents better than the consensus. What’s more, the brokerage community as a whole has a bullish outlook on DG stock. For instance, Thomson/First Call data states that Dollar General has received 19 buy ratings, seven holds and no sell ratings. The 12-month price target of $99.71, meanwhile, represents a healthy premium of about 9.8%. Turning to data on short selling, there were 5.65 million shares of DG stock sold short as of the most recent reporting period. Representing a mere 2.17% of DG’s total float, this figure is hardly worth noting. However, it is worth pointing out that short interest plunged by 22% in the most recent period, indicating that short sellers are abandoning Dollar General in droves — which could be a sign that bears are concerned about a post-earnings rally for DG stock. Click to Enlarge Options traders, on the other hand, remain skeptical of DG stock’s post-earnings prowess. At last check, the August/September put/call open interest ratio rested at 1.02, with puts and calls in near parity. This ratio dips only fractionally to 1.00 for the weekly August 26 series. Overall, weekly August 26 series implieds are pricing in a potential post-earnings move of about 4.2% for DG stock. This places the upper bound at $94.85 and the lower bound at $87.15. Key short-term support for DG lies at $90, with $85 providing a potential backstop, while the $100 mark is the biggest technical hurdle for DG, though the shares will have to power past short-term resistance at $95 first. 2 Trades for DG Stock Call Spread: Dollar General has a history of moving higher in response to quarterly earnings reports. This coupled with the fact that the shares are hovering near technical support and in oversold territory could provide the impetus for a post-earnings rally. As such, traders looking side with the bulls ahead of DG’s report might want to consider a Sept $92.50/$95 bull call spread. At last check, this spread was offered at $1, or $100 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $93.50, while a maximum profit of $1.50, or $150 per pair of contracts, is possible if DG closes at or above $95 when September options expire. Why Twitter Inc (TWTR) Will Finally Get Bought Out Put Sell: On the other hand, those with a bullish-to-neutral bias on DG might consider a weekly Aug 26 series $85 put sell position. At last check, the August $85 put was bid at 36 cents, or $36 per contract. The upside to this put sell strategy is that you keep the premium as long as DG stock closes above $85 when these options expire at the end of this week. The downside is that should DG trade below $85 ahead of expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at a cost of $85 per share. As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share What Should Walmart Do Now That It’s Landed Jet.com? Image courtesy of Mike Mozart August 23, 2016 9:39 am EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk the honeymoon is over walmart jet.com wal-jet retailers retail e-commerce It’s no secret why Walmart bought Jet.com for $3 billion: the company’s e-commerce know-howo and experienced could be the key to the brick-and-mortar retailer’s plans of catching up with Amazon, finally, after all these years. But now that the honeymoon is over, it’s time to look at how, exactly, this marriage will work. Walmart bought Jet.com for a few reasons, including true love, but namely, its experience in the logistics and distribution processes needed for an online business, its affluent customer base, and the e-commerce minded employee culture that is so different from Walmart’s traditional retail environment. It’ll be tricky for Walmart to suddenly move to the quick and nimble innovative corporate culture of an entirely online business, Mohanbir Sawhney, the McCormick Foundation chair of technology and director of the Center for Research in Technology & Innovation at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management says in writing for Forbes. “E-commerce demands an entrepreneurial culture where experimentation and failure are par for the course,” he writes. “Converting Walmart into a nimble e-commerce competitor is a little bit like asking an Olympic athlete who has trained all his life as a weightlifter to suddenly become a gymnast. That is why Walmart needed to buy rather than build its e-commerce capabilities.” Just buying Jet.com doesn’t mean that all Walmart’s dreams will now come true, however: it’ll depend on what the company does now with its new bride. Sawhney’s view is that Walmart will come out best in the long run if Jet.com’s executive team and technical experts rebuild Walmart’s website and work on its e-commerce distribution, thus giving the retailer a bit of a makeover. Keeping Jet.com’s corporate culture and adaptability will be key, but not so easily accomplished, Sawhney says. And Walmart can’t just come in there with its ideas about how traditional retail works and stifle the spirit of Jet.com. If history has taught us anything, it’s that successfully combining two companies that are so different isn’t very easy. Often, big corporate parents who snatch up budding new businesses have a tendency to smother their acquisitions into an early grave. “Moreover, Walmart does not have a history of growing through acquisitions,” Sawhney says. It’s all worth a try, however, as Walmart is likely aware of these challenges, and figures it’s worth it if it can carve out even a little bit of Amazon’s market share.

Now Walmart’s Investigating The Sheet Manufacturer That Target Ditched Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Now Walmart’s Investigating The Sheet Manufacturer That Target Ditched Image courtesy of Mike Mozart August 23, 2016 10:16 am EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler Taking a closer look walmart retail welspun manufacturer egyptian cotton supplier Days after Target terminated its relationship with one of the world’s biggest textile manufacturers after finding the company supplied the retailer with nearly a million sheet sets labeled as “Egyptian Cotton” that were actually made from non-Egyptian cotton, Walmart says it’s reviewing Welspun India’s records and cotton certifications.  Bloomberg reports that Walmart is scrutinizing Welspun’s products and records to determine if there are any discrepancies with the quality and labeling of sheets and pillowcases provided to the world’s largest retailer. A spokesperson for Walmart says the company will hold discussions with Welspun and “handle it appropriately” if issues are uncovered. Walmart, along with Welspun’s largest customer Bed Bath & Beyond, sell 500 and 800 thread count sheets online under the Crowning Touch label for about $175, Bloomberg reports. A rep for Welspun, which makes towels, sheets, rugs and carpets for 18 of the top 30 retailers around the world, didn’t provide comment on Walmart’s review. The company previously told Bloomberg that it was reviewing its supply chain and would hire an accounting firm to examine its processes. Analysts say the latest development is cause for worry for the manufacturer. “It is likely that other customers too will start raising questions over Welspun’s supplies,” said Arun Kejriwal, a director at Kejriwal Research & Investment Pvt. in Mumbai, tells Bloomberg. Troubles for the manufacturer began on Friday when Target pulled its products from shelves and began notifying customers that they’ll get a refund on certain products under the Fieldcrest label that sold for as much as $75.

By Larry Dignan for Between the Lines | August 23, 2016 -- 14:06 GMT (07:06 PDT) | Topic: Cloud Walmart is pondering lumping its OneOps open source cloud management platform under OpenStack since the two projects have integrated so well in an internal deployment. special feature Integrating the Hybrid Cloud As far and fast as cloud computing is embedding itself into the enterprise, there remain many cloud-resistant applications and services. Read More The retailing giant's OneOps platform is already open source and on Github, but the company has rolled out its management console along with OpenStack for years. OneOps was founded in 2011 as a company focused on provisioning and managing applications in the cloud. Walmart Labs acquired the company in 2013 and used its software to run its e-commerce sites. In January, Walmart Labs released OneOps as an open source project under Apache 2.0. Wal-Mart buys Jet for $3 billion, hopes to turbo charge e-commerce | Walmart tops Q2 targets on double digit ecommerce growth In a demonstration at OpenStack East in New York, Andrew Mitry, Walmart's lead cloud engineer, said the company deployed OneOps and OpenStack together and wanted to "start a conversation about moving OneOps into OpenStack." Mitry's main point is that OneOps and OpenStack work well together and could advance the cause of an open source cloud operating system. Kire Filipovski, a distinguished architect at Walmart Labs and co-founder of OneOps, said the OneOps software is deployed in more than 30 cloud regions and the uptake of applications and users has surged over the last three years. Filipovski noted that OneOps is used to deploy various instances of open source technologies. The demo included a Postgres deployment. "We are heavily pushing open source technologies at this point," he said. Overall, Walmart is creating and destroying cloud instances at a rapid rate. "The (adoption) curve is unpredictable and we're building a platform that's built for change," he said.

Now, "dogs of the Dow" investors are being handsomely rewarded for rolling the dice on these two downtrodden picks. "Dogs of the Dow has been a great strategy over the years, and this really is a classic dogs of the Dow," Eddy Elfenbein said on CNBC's "Power Lunch" when discussing Wal-Mart and Caterpillar. "Both stocks had terrible years last year, and both have done quite well this year," he said Friday. Caterpillar and Wal-Mart have soared 23 and 19 percent, respectively, this year. Elfenbein, editor of the "Crossing Wall Street" blog, explained that "dogs of the Dow" calls for investing in 10 Dow stocks with the highest dividend yield at the end of the year and then holding onto those stocks for one year. As it stands, the "dogs of the Dow" strategy has outperformed the market in recent years. With Wal-Mart in mind, Elfenbein noted that the retailer raised guidance following a strong second quarter and, leading up, had been "investing in themselves." Additionally, Wal-Mart opted to give employees a wage increase, and Elfenbein said the company is "cleaning up their stores and going after Target's audience. I think going forward, Wal-Mart is the better buy, and Caterpillar still has a lot of work to do." However, Piper Jaffray senior technical strategist Craig Johnson said investors should remove sentiment from the equation when evaluating which former "dog" is a better buy right now. "We like both of the charts, but if I had to take a choice between one or the other, I would actually choose Caterpillar. I think you've got more upside here when you just unemotionally look at the charts," said Johnson, referring the five-year performance of both companies.

And the reason says a lot about how the retail giant does business and its place in the larger economy. Time reported last week that police in many communities get more calls to Walmart shopping centers than anywhere else. For some stores, police are called multiple times a day. The problem appears to be far larger for Walmart than for competing retailers like Target. And the crime ranges from mostly standard shoplifting and petty theft to the occasional rape, stabbing, shooting, murder, or meth lab hidden in a 6-foot drainage pipe under the store parking lot. "I've got all my bad guys in one place," Darrell Ross, a Tulsa police officer permanently stationed at the local Walmart, joked to Bloomberg. Critics in both stories point to Walmart's aggressive cost-cutting, beginning in 2000 with the tenure of former CEO Lee Scott, as a big part of the problem. Retail consultants told Time that Walmart likely has about 400,000 fewer workers in the U.S. today than a decade ago. In giant stores that can range up to five acres, that translates into one worker for every 524 square feet of retail space — a 19 percent decrease in workers per square foot from 10 years ago. The greeters at the entrances are gone, many cashiers have been replaced with automated checkout scanners, and there are simply fewer eyeballs monitoring everything than before. That all proved beneficial for Walmart's bottom line, as sales per employee grew 23 percent over that same time period. But just like some Walmart detractors accuse the company of relying on government aid programs to subsidize its workers, critics say Walmart is skimping on security and implicitly farming the cost out to publicly-financed police forces. "It's ridiculous — we are talking about the biggest retailer in the world," Robert Rohloff, a police sergeant in Tulsa, told Bloomberg. "I may have half my squad there for hours." Walmart is making some moves to solve the problem, like installing eye-level security cameras and moving more of its remaining employees towards the exits. The company is going to spend $2.7 billion to raise wages throughout its stores, and thus hopefully boost morale and training. Walmart is also rolling out a program whereby shoplifters, instead of having the cops called on them, can pay a fee and take a theft-deterrence class. Burt Flickinger, the managing director of Strategic Resource Group, a retail consultant, told Bloomberg that the most straightforward fix is just for Walmart to spend the necessary money — and that $2.7 billion isn't enough. He estimated the company needs to spend at least $3.25 billion a year on additional part-time work, and even that wouldn't bring them to the ratio of workers per square foot they had in the 1990s. The idea would be to get Walmart's operations closer to those of its competitors like Target, which just has a lot more workers for its space. (Though it doesn't necessarily pay them more.) But the Target comparison also reveals a bigger reason for why Walmart cuts corners. Target has steadily enjoyed larger profits than Walmart: Its financial statements from 2015 show a profit margin of 4.6 percent, versus just 3 percent for Walmart. That 3 percent amounted to $14.7 billion, which would be cut by a quarter just by Flickinger's recommendations. Add on the general pressure for Walmart to pay a living wage and such, and its profit margin starts to quickly shrink. Despite investing in a larger employee force to monitor its stores, and a few other measures, Target enjoys a higher profit margin. That's probably because of the company's overall business strategy, which relies on smaller stores and a more affluent customer base. Walmart shoppers earn 18 percent less than Target shoppers on average, and the gap between them and Costco or Macy's shoppers is even bigger. Walmart brings in way more shoppers who make under $25,000 than Target. And as you keep going up the income ladder, Walmart's share of the customer base shrinks while Target's increases. Walmart's business model relies on low prices because it serves a precarious and low-wage customer base. And Walmart operates in a world where recoveries from recessions are grindingly slow, incomes have stagnated or even fallen for the middle and lower slices of American workers, and where big cities are the few remaining islands of economic vibrancy. So it has to keep cutting prices to keep up with its customers' ability to pay. But Walmart is also the country's biggest employer, and the biggest employer in 19 states. So when it holds down pay to make its price cuts financially viable, it ends up creating a vicious cycle. All the while, Walmart has trouble keeping a profit margin compared to upscale competitors. Walmart's lawbreaking problem is, to some extent, an outgrowth of where its stores are located. Impoverished communities are more likely to be afflicted by crime in general, and these days a Walmart store is often the biggest retail hub — or even the biggest hub for economic activity, period — in those communities. Critics of the crime problem also point out that Walmart stores — unlike Target — are open 24 hours to allow people to congregate or camp out in parking lots. But that's part and parcel of the outsized social role Walmart stores can play in these dying communities: "They can easily generate more traffic than the whole town," Charles Fishman, author of The Wal-Mart Effect, told Time. "By pure numbers, the crime is going to be where the people are." So certainly, some of Walmart's ruthlessness is a choice by the company's leadership. But some of it is a necessity, making Walmart a creature of our broader failure to create opportunity for low-income Americans: You can be ruthless and sell to these consumers, or not be ruthless and not sell to them at all. Neither Walmart nor any other private business can work with money that isn't already there. Try 4 Risk-Free Issues of The Week magazine.

That share is expected to grow with the recent rollout of what Home Depot calls BODFS, or buy online and deliver from store, according to Home Depot CEO Craig Menear. BODFS allows customers to pick a much shorter delivery window and have purchases delivered from their local Home Depot store. The program has rolled out in 700 of Home Depot's 2,200 stores, and will be available at all stores by the end of the year, Menear said last week on an earnings call.  Retail industry experts and analysts have long encouraged brick-and-mortar retailers to better utilize their physical stores to compete with Amazon online.  Both Walmart and Home Depot have a long way to go before they catch up to Amazon in terms of online revenue, however. Walmart's online sales were $13.7 billion in 2015, compared to Amazon's $107 billion. Home Depot doesn't break out sales for e-commerce, but said online sales accounted for about 5.6% of its $26.5 billion in second-quarter sales.  NOW WATCH: 4 things every man should know before going into a Victoria's Secret Go to MSN Home More in Money 7 successful icons who had a brush with bankruptcy InvestorPlace 20 best money tips of all time from Tony Robbins GOBankingRates 7 CEOs heading to the chopping block InvestorPlace The most dangerous states in America 24/7 Wall St. 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money Up Next What the richest 1 percent earns in every state Money Talks News AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More From Business Insider Here's what can happen when you eat too much salt Business Insider The pound is tumbling Business Insider 5 most annoying resume mistakes Business Insider 19 easy ways to slowly destroy your career Business Insider Business Insider View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

Welspun’s list of troubles keep getting longer and longer. India’s largest home textile exporter finds itself tied in knots with a problem that the company admits is entirely its own making.   Here’s what happened. On Friday Target issued a statement alleging that Welspun had substituted non-Egyptian cotton for sheets that were sold under the Fieldcrest brand. These sheets manufactured between August 2014 and July 2016 were sold as 500 thread Egyptian cotton count sheets at $175 apiece.   Ever mindful of customer satisfaction (and the threat of litigation) Target pulled the sheets from its shelves, offered customers a full refund and said it was terminating its relationship with Welspun. While Target accounts for 10 percent of Welspun’s sales the reputation loss was a body blow for the company.   In a hastily arranged conference call on Monday morning Rajesh Mandawewala admitted to the lapse and said that the company was appointing an audit firm to probe further. The company expects the report to be out in 6-8 weeks. On Monday its stock tumbled 20 percent shaving off Rs2300 crore in market cap. Tuesday morning brought further bad news with Walmart stating that it was examining products supplied by Welspun. Bloomberg reported a Walmart spokeswoman was saying that if any issues were discovered the retailer plans to “handle it appropriately.”   Welspun’s shareholders are irate. They’ve rushed to the exit. On Tuesday, the stock was down another 20 percent with about 3,00,00,000 shares waiting to be sold on Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange. While there were question marks over the integrity of the Welspun management, some message boards wondered whether this could lead to retailers auditing supplies from other suppliers as well. Rising cotton prices have been another overhang for the sector. Indian companies have a 48 percent share of the US home textile market.   For the time being, investors are showing that they’re nervous while analysts have revised their growth forecasts for Welspun. While the company has disclosed that sheets made of Egyptian cotton constituted no more than 3-6 percent of revenues in the last two years, investors are waiting to see what sort of liability Target imposes on Welspun. One thing is certain: Welspun is unlikely to reach its target of $2 billion in sales by 2020.

(TGT) terminated business with the Indian textile manufacturer over cheaper bedsheets and pillowcases being labeled as premium Egyptian cotton. Following this, retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) is reviewing supplier Welspun's cotton certification records, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Welspun India, part of conglomerate Welspun Group, told BSE in a filing that it has initiated a probe in the matter. "We have initiated actions to investigate the root cause. We are appointing an external auditor to audit our supply systems and processes. This is an issue of highest priority for us and we will take all necessary steps to address it." Target on Friday announced that it was ending all business with Welspun India after it discovered last month that 750,000 sheets and pillowcases labeled as Egyptian cotton were actually made with another type of cotton. The retailer pulled the items from its stores. The company began to notify customers on Friday about a refund on the products. These were produced between August 2014 and July 2016 and sold for as much as $75. Target confirmed that the withdrawal includes two lines of Egyptian cotton bedding, and not all of its Egyptian cotton sheets are affected. Mumbai-based Welspun makes towels, sheets, rugs and carpets for 18 of the top 30 global retailers. Target is Welspun's second-biggest customer, behind Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., and Wal-Mart is the third-biggest customer. Other major clients include J.C. Penney Co. and Macy's Inc. Welspun also manufactures towels for the Wimbledon tennis championships and the Rugby World Cup. As per reports, every fifth towel sold in the US is manufactured by Welspun India, and its sales to Target amounted to $90 million in the fiscal year ended in March. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News The Worst IPO flops of 2016 Preview: Thanksgiving Week Economic Data Top Ten Corporate Comeback Stories More Top Stories Trump To Nominate Haley As U.S. Ambassador To The United Nations Voters At Odds With Trump On Several Key Issues Major Averages Remain On Opposite Sides Of Unchanged Line - U.S. Commentary H.J.

FIRST IN THE WORLD-HERALD Hayneedle looks forward to boost in sales, hiring after Walmart buys its parent company By Cole Epley / World-Herald staff writer Cole Epley Aug 24, 2016 (…) RYAN SODERLIN/THE WORLD-HERALD Photographer Wendy Wees, left, and stylist Cora Coppock work to put products in their best light at the Hayneedle photo studio.

RYAN SODERLIN/THE WORLD-HERALD Becky Kelly, left, a senior product development buyer, Rebecca Gray, center, vice president of merchandising, and Christine Tvrdik, a senior product development buyer, talk about possible fabric choices for furniture at the Hayneedle photo studio. Hayneedle got a big lift when Jet.com scooped up the local home furnishings e-retailer earlier this year. Now, Walmart’s purchase of Jet.com is set to give Hayneedle another boost, the Omaha company’s chief executive said. Hayneedle Chief Executive Jon Barker told The World-Herald the company is on track to surpass $500 million in sales in 2016, up about 40 percent from more than $350 million in 2015. “We were able to partner with Jet and really put the resources toward the Hayneedle platform that we’ve built for so long,” Barker said. “That has taken off at a rate that has probably been the highest in the history of the company.” With the added Jet marketing muscle, more people are visiting the Hayneedle site to find products as varied as hammocks and high-end patio furniture. But more important, more of those people are actually making purchases, he said. To handle the growth, 14-year-old Hayneedle has been on a hiring spree — and it’s not stopping with the Walmart deal, Barker said. Hayneedle today has almost 600 local employees compared with 400 when the Jet deal closed in late February. “We have 300 more people to hire through the remainder of this year alone, more than 200 of which are in Omaha,” he said. That would bring its local headcount to 800 or more. As a Jet subsidiary, Hayneedle maintains its separate identity and its corporate headquarters here, along with a photo studio and a call center. New Jersey-based Jet, which formally launched in July 2015, spent the second half of last year building up its customer roll while raising hundreds of millions of dollars from private-equity investors. Of that, $90 million went to Omaha to complete the Hayneedle purchase, and a far larger portion was earmarked for raising the companies’ profiles among would-be shoppers of competitor Amazon.com, Jet co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Marc Lore, has said. But where Amazon has matured since its founding in the mid-1990s, Jet still has some growing up to do: The company at its launch last summer was banking on a $49.99 annual membership fee, but it scrapped the model, promising instead to beat competitors on pricing. (Hayneedle is operated separately and never had an annual fee.) To that end, Jet uses a pricing algorithm that determines the lowest-cost combination of goods and sellers based on location of products and other factors. Apparently the approach is attractive, and the $3.3 billion deal in which big-box giant Walmart bought Jet earlier this month should keep moving the needle in Omaha. That makes the big question whether the Jet deal will move the e-commerce needle for Walmart, the largest retailer in the world. Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove told The World-Herald earlier this month that the retailer’s network of brick-and-mortar stores gives it more than 4,000 potential distribution points for web retailing, not to mention its own dedicated e-commerce distribution facilities and the industry expertise that accompanies the Jet team. Company executives on Aug. 16 presented a better-than-expected outlook for the rest of the year with second-quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates. That’s despite the forecast of a small hit to earnings per share tied to the Jet deal. But some analysts are not yet sold. E-commerce sales at Walmart jumped 12 percent in the second quarter versus the same period a year ago, according to the company’s most recent financial filings. That’s decent, but it lagged behind such growth at Target, which reported e-commerce growth of 16 percent from the same period last year. And even though the Arkansas-based retailer boasts almost $485 billion in annual revenue, online sales there make up about $14 billion of that total, according to Morningstar analyst Erin Lash. Amazon, meanwhile, has roughly $100 billion in annual sales. Lash in a note to clients last week said the Jet deal is expected to boost Walmart’s share of online sales. It has the name recognition and heft to better narrow the gap, and “shipping costs for e-commerce firms are much higher than those for brick-and-mortar firms,” she said. Less clear is just how long that will take. Lash also said the push to compete with Amazon and other e-commerce heavyweights could come at the slight expense of sales in Walmart’s own stores, which require overhead regardless of where sales are made: “The supercenter — or any other store — and its labor and other overhead, including rent or mortgage, is the unnecessary middleman in the Amazon business model,” she said. While the Jet-Walmart integration plays out, Hayneedle’s Barker said the Omaha business will keep humming along. Local product development teams continue to design and develop new product collections to make sure offerings stay fresh and fit in with shoppers’ changing tastes, for example, and that mid- to high-end furniture beckons a more affluent customer than the average Walmart shopper. And where electronics and appliances are increasingly bought and sold via online channels, Barker said it’s a far smaller share of home goods like Hayneedle’s own Belham Living and Coral Coast lines of furnishings that are bought and sold only online. Only 7 percent of home furnishings sales happen online in the U.S., Barker said. “We’re in the early stages for home furnishings online, and we’re in a position to capitalize on that.” Contact the writer: 402-444-1534, cole.epley@owh.com More information Walmart deal will pay off for Jet.com backers With Walmart Stores buying Jet.com for $3.3 billion, some of the biggest names on Wall Street and Silicon Valley — from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Google’s venture arm — are cashing in.

NATION NATION Soldier who killed 5 Dallas police officers showed PTSD symptoms, documents show Micah Johnson Associated Press Micah Johnson, the Army reservist who shot and killed five Dallas police officers. Micah Johnson, the Army reservist who shot and killed five Dallas police officers. (Associated Press) Associated Press The Army reservist who shot and killed five Dallas police officers last month showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder after returning home from Afghanistan in 2014 and sought treatment for anxiety, depression and hallucinations, according to newly released documents from the Veterans Health Administration. Micah Johnson told doctors he experienced nightmares after witnessing fellow soldiers getting blown in half and said he heard voices and mortars exploding, according to the documents obtained by the Associated Press under the Freedom of Information Act. "I try to block those out, but it is kinda hard to forget," Johnson told his care provider, according to the documents.

During his deployment, Johnson was largely confined to base in an area of Afghanistan that had seen heavy combat but that was relatively quiet when his unit arrived in November 2013, according to his former squad leader.

President-elect Trump released his first extended remarks since the election in a YouTube video, an Orange County health network is putting doctors in grocery stores, the range and scope of Donald Trump’s business interests are unprecedented, and Kanye West was hospitalized Monday for stress and exhaustion after a bizarre week. Upon his return to the U.S. nine months later, Johnson told doctors he was experiencing panic attacks a few times a week, including once while at Wal-Mart, where there was an unspecified conflict that required police response, the records said. "Veteran states hearing all the noises, fights and police intervening caused him to have palpitations, 'My heart felt like someone was pinching it while it was beating fast,'" the records state. Johnson said he began physically shaking, felt short of breath and got chills following the Wal-Mart incident. Doctors concluded that Johnson presented a low risk for suicide or for hurting anyone else. Johnson was "not acutely at risk for harm to self or others," according to a medical record from a visit on Aug. 15, 2014. The patient was "not felt to be psychotic by presentation or by observation." The patient told healthcare providers he had lower back pain and was avoiding "crowds of people and when in the public, scanning the area for danger, noting all the exits, everyone's actions." "I feel like I can't trust all of these strangers around me," Johnson told his doctor, who noted that he had taken to drinking since his return to Dallas, taking three to four shots of vodka up to three times a week. "It's hard for me to be around other people and I am so angry and irritable." Records from the Aug. 15 visit state that Johnson described his childhood as "stressful." His responses to a section of the form titled "Sexual/Physical/Emotional Abuse History" were redacted. Johnson was also advised to talk with a healthcare worker about erectile dysfunction. Johnson was prescribed a muscle relaxant, an antidepressant and anti-anxiety and sleep medication, and a nurse offered him tips on managing anger, records show. He also saw a psychiatrist and was further evaluated for his PTSD symptoms in September 2014, but the physician noted his mood was "better." When providers called Johnson a month later, he requested to put off further evaluation for PTSD, saying he was busy remodeling his mother's house, according to the records. He had previously told providers that he planned to find a job in construction and that his long-term goal was to become a self-defense instructor. Johnson's mother, Delphene Johnson, previously said her son had sought medical care from the Department of Veterans Affairs for a back injury, but got no help after filling out forms and going to meetings, so he "just finally gave up," she told the Blaze, a news site founded by conservative talk show host Glenn Beck. Dallas VA spokesman Ozzie Garza did not immediately respond to questions regarding Johnson's treatment within the VA North Texas Health Care System, the second largest VA system in the country.

Johnson was “not acutely at risk for harm to self or others,” according to a medical record from a visit on Aug. 15, 2014.

Check out the best travel deals and destinations Opinion Beth Kassab: Eyes on solar tax break for a greener Florida Solar energy amendments demystified - Orlando News Now In less than a month voters will face the first of two state law changes regarding solar energy up for approval this year. In less than a month voters will face the first of two state law changes regarding solar energy up for approval this year. Beth KassabContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Columnist Why Amendment 4 on solar power matters Solar is suddenly heating up in Florida. After years of little fanfare, the renewable energy source is finally getting more attention in this state than the latest possible tropical storm's cone of definite uncertainty. What a relief, right? With two solar amendments up for votes this year, a big push by new solar co-ops and investments from the big utilities, the Sunshine State must be on its way to ditching fossil fuels and going greener than a jar of slime from the old Nickelodeon Studios. Not exactly. Florida's solar forecast right now is still much like those tracking models for big storms — reliably unreliable. A lot still needs to happen for Florida to become a more viable solar market. And big businesses and the big utilities disagree on what those steps are. We'll get to that. First, a point on which most everyone agrees: Amendment 4. The question on Tuesday's ballot would extend tax breaks on renewable devices like solar panels to businesses.

The law, passed in 2009, is meant to protect homeowners who want to use plants and grasses in their yards that need less water and fertilizer than the typical lush St. Augustine lawn.   If the necessary 60 percent of voters answer yes on Amendment 4, there is wide agreement from the pro-business Florida Chamber of Commerce to the tree-hugging Sierra Club that Florida's solar market would improve. Al Sharpton, who flew into Miami earlier this month to rail against the amendment, is a rare exception. Sharpton seemed to be yearning to shake his fist at another big corporate tax break that would hurt the little guy. But his press conference veered into a strange and terse exchange with reporters when he couldn't explain how the amendment would harm people. The whole thing smacked of an activist who was woefully uninformed about what he was advocating against. Here's an example to help Sharpton out: If, say, Walmart wanted to add solar panels to its rooftops and generate some of its own power, it could do so without that equipment adding to its property tax bill if the amendment passes. It would be similar to the break homeowners who purchase panels already get on their taxes. Walmart happens to have 365 solar systems at stores across more than a dozen states and Puerto Rico. But none are in Florida. "We don't have any on-site solar installations at our stores in Florida right now, but we're always looking at opportunities to add solar at stores across the country where it makes economic sense," said Ragan Dickens, Walmart director of sustainability communications in an e-mail. Q&A: Shining light on solar amendments Gray Rohrer TALLAHASSEE – Voters this year are being offered the chance to approve two solar amendments, with major implications for businesses and the future of how Florida consumes energy. Like the first sunbeam rudely bursting through the window in the morning, the differing messages of the business groups,... TALLAHASSEE – Voters this year are being offered the chance to approve two solar amendments, with major implications for businesses and the future of how Florida consumes energy. Like the first sunbeam rudely bursting through the window in the morning, the differing messages of the business groups,... (Gray Rohrer) Companies like Walmart aren't investing in solar equipment in Florida because it doesn't make financial sense for them right now. So no current property tax revenue from those companies is at risk from Amendment 4. But the amendment could mean the start of more solar activity on the part of businesses. Thanks to tax breaks, reduced costs and programs offered by utilities, the number of homeowners using solar has increased, though they are still a faction of total power customers. Duke Energy Florida said about 3,600 of its 1.7 million customers are using their own rooftop solar panels today. That's a 400 percent jump from just five years ago, when Duke customers with solar numbered just about 700. And a surge in activity among solar co-ops, which pool homeowners together to bargain for a lower rate from solar installers, could mean more people opt for rooftop panels — still a significant investment of $10,000 to $20,000 depending on the home. A co-op in Orange County is attempting to sign up at least 500 people, though not everyone is expected to go through with purchasing the panels. All of that is good news for people who want to see solar become a bigger player in Florida. But there are no guarantees. The debate about a second solar amendment on the November ballot known as Amendment 1 is still at a low simmer and destined to boil over in the next couple months. That's the one that pits businesses against the utilities. More on that in the next few weeks. We'll have a better idea about solar's forecast in Florida after Tuesday. bkassab@orlandosentinel.com Privacy Policy Copyright © 2016, Orlando Sentinel Advocates pitch sunny future for solar Solar power amendment makes ballot Solar: 'Yes' in August — but 'no' in November All Sections News Sports Business Classified Entertainment Travel Obituaries 78°

Confirming that Welspun supplies a number of products to Walmart, a spokesperson of the US retail major said, “We are currently reviewing Welspun cotton certification records and plan to have additional conversations with Welspun. If we discover an issue, we will handle it appropriately.” After an extensive investigation, Target Corporation confirmed that Welspun, that uses Egyptian cotton to make bedsheets and pillowcases sold by the retailer, substituted another type of non-Egyptian cotton when producing these sheets between August 2014 and July 2016. Target is Welspun India’s biggest customer after Bed Bath and Beyond. It accounted for about $90 million, or 10 percent of the company’s total business in the financial year through March. “We have informed Welspun that, due to this conduct, we are in the process of terminating our relationship with them,” Target Corp said. Welspun, however, said that it was investigating the product specification issue and would hire one of the ‘Big Four’ accountancy firms to review its supply processes. Welspun India’s market capitalisation has eroded by a whopping Rs 4,376 crore from  21 August to Rs 5958 crore on 24 August.

Safeway is launching grocery delivery in the Denver metro area, joining King Soopers, Walmart and third-party providers like Instacart in offering the increasingly popular service. Starting Wednesday, customers of both Safeway and Albertsons (both chains are owned by the same parent) can log onto shop.safeway.com, fill up their virtual grocery carts and have their order delivered to their homes within a one-, two- or four-hour window. The delivery area currently includes most of metro Denver, from Lone Tree to Boulder, including Denver, Aurora, Thornton, Northglenn, Westminster, Broomfield, Lafayette, Arvada, Wheat Ridge, Lakewood, Littleton, Englewood, Centennial and Highlands Ranch. “The plan is to expand to other parts of Colorado, but this is our first go of it here,” Safeway spokeswoman Kris Staaf said. “We’ve had the service in other markets like California, Washington and Oregon, and it’s been tremendously successful.” Customer demand was a driving force in the decision to expand the service into Denver. “We had more requests for home delivery in Denver than any other city Safeway serves,” Denver division president Todd Broderick said in a statement. Groceries will be delivered by a fleet of more than dozen new trucks. The refrigerated trucks are equipped with multiple temperature zones so frozen pizzas stay frozen and fresh veggies stay crisp. “E-commerce is big business,” Staaf said. “To be able to offer this to our customers in the Denver metro area is really exciting.” Tags:  Albertsons grocery stores King Soopers Safeway Walmart Emilie Rusch Emilie Rusch covers commercial real estate and retail for The Post.

The trust unloaded 3.5 million shares at prices ranging from $72.45 to $74.28 on Aug. 19 and 22, according to a regulatory filing. Those transactions follow $104 million of sales at the end of June at prices between $70.67 and $71.86. Shares of the retailer have climbed this year after closing at a four-year low of $56.42 in November. Seventy-seven percent of analysts tracked by Bloomberg have a hold rating on the stock, with an average 12-month price target of $73.68. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Walton Enterprises, the family's main investment entity, distributed about 6 percent of the shares to the trust in April 2015. The family said in a statement that it expects to sell shares from time to time to help fund charitable contributions and offset possible further increases in its ownership percentage as a result of the company's stock buyback programs. The trust now owns about 170 million shares of the business, the filings show. That's a fraction of the 1.4 billion shares held by Walton Enterprises. Together the two entities own 51 percent of the retailer. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart and the Walton family directed Bloomberg to the April 2015 statement.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Salt Lake City police cancel Amber Alert for 3-year-old girl who is found safe in Hawaii BYU football: RB coach Reno Mahe's daughter clings to life after hanging accident Utah lawmaker accuses charter school of skirting procurement law Ed Kimball, who wrote warts-and-all biographies of his father, Mormon leader Spencer Kimball, dies | BYU basketball: Title belt at stake as Cougs get rematch with Valparaiso ELEVATE During National Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Month the Focus is Keeping Caregivers Healthy   Life is a Peach at the SALT Awards   Salt Lake Regional Medical Center First in the U.S. to Perform Meniscus Replacement   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

By Mark Znidar The Columbus Dispatch  •  Thursday August 25, 2016 12:04 AM The Clippers must feel like they have seen as much traffic go through the clubhouse doors as a greeter sees at Wal-Mart because of injuries, call-ups, releases, trades and others opting out of their contracts. There also have been only five days off other than the three-day all-star break, but the Clippers clinched their third straight International League West championship Wednesday. Shawn Morimando threw six innings of three-hit ball, Tommy Hunter, Craig Stammen and Cody Anderson each pitched a scoreless inning of relief and Michael Choice hit a two-run home run to lead the Clippers to a 3-1 victory over the Indianapolis Indians at Victory Park. The Clippers (78-54), who won their ninth straight game and 10th in 11 games, have been in first place for all but two days since June 28. Twelve games remain in the regular season before the Clippers begin pursuit of a second straight Governors’ Cup championship, a fourth since 2010 and 11th overall. The team has soldiered on despite 217 player transactions that included seeing all-star pitchers Mike Clevinger and Shawn Armstrong and infielder Michael Martinez called up to the Cleveland Indians. Catcher Adam Moore, 32, has played with Seattle, Kansas City, San Diego and Cleveland and yearns for another chance at the big leagues. That hasn’t distracted him from the job at hand. “We come together as a group regardless of the transactions and regardless of who is here,’’ Moore said. “We’ve just got a great group of guys. We grind every day — we just grind — and we are a family.” Moore saluted fourth-year manager Chris Tremie for bringing the players together. There have been two four-game losing streaks and an eight-game losing streak, but the team has been consistently strong since mid-July. “Tremie has got this team taking pride, from player one through 25, in what we do,’’ Moore said. “He gets us prepared and ready to play every single game.” Choice hit a two-run homer in the third inning. Rodriguez drove in the third in the fifth. That’s all Morimando (5-1) needed. He gave up one run, walked one and struck out five. Morimando began the season with double-A Akron but was promoted to Cleveland on July 2 after the Indians pitching staff was depleted during a 19-inning victory at Toronto. He has kept up the solid work for the Clippers. Anderson got his first triple-A save by striking out the side in the ninth. He began the season with Cleveland but was sent to the Clippers after a rocky start. mznidar@dispatch.com @MarkZnidar   mznidar@dispatch.com @markznidar Favorite Print Story Advertisement • Place an ad Sports Video More Videos Advertisement • Place an ad Explore Columbus Search Businesses Featured Businesses Loading...

CNN Money2:31 UP NEXT A year ago, it seemed like Wal-Mart might end up just another victim of Amazon's e-commerce dominance. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 70.75 +0.63 +0.89% Tesla Motors Inc TSLA ▲ 195.19 +4.02 +2.10% However, as WMT’s second-quarter earnings report revealed, Walmart may not have to beat AMZN to thrive. Second Place Good Enough For WMT While there’s no denying the secular retail shift to e-commerce, AMZN isn’t necessarily the grim reaper for all traditional retailers. Walmart seems to be a perfect example. 7 Best Dividend Stocks You Haven’t Heard Of Other retailers like Target, Macy's and Gap are clearly struggling to figure out how to compete with AMZN. However, WMT just delivered positive overall sales growth, 3% U.S. sales growth, 1.6% same-store sales growth and 12% EPS growth. That is certainly not the kind of quarter you’d expect from a dying company. WMT stock is also trading near its 52-week high. Let’s be clear — Walmart is not beating Amazon. But that’s OK. “No one catches Amazon online,” Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea says. “The key is to be No. 2.” WMT’s online sales growth numbers were nowhere near AMZN’s numbers, but WMT still reported 11.8% digital sales growth in Q2. WMT Turning The Corner? One of the most difficult things for investors to identify is the exact inflection point when a struggling business turns the corner. WMT’s Q2 numbers seem to suggest that its turnaround strategy is working. But one quarter of good numbers is not a trend. WMT’s same-store sales growth of 1.6% is its strongest quarterly number since 2013. WMT’s online sales growth represents the first quarterly uptick following nine consecutive quarters of declines. Still, there are plenty of causes for concern. WMT’s U.K. operations remain a problem. Same-store sales in the U.K. plummeted 7.5% in Q2. Overall international sales were down 6.6%. Will Jet.com Be WMT’s E-Commerce Solution? Outside of WMT’s surprisingly upbeat Q2 earnings report, the biggest recent Walmart news has been a $3 billion buyout of Jet.com. Jet.com is only about a year old, but it has delivered impressive growth in that time. Jet.com’s sales have surged 168% from August 2015 to July 2016. Jet.com won’t be taking down Amazon anytime soon. However, it could be the key to Walmart establishing a solid number two position in the U.S. e-commerce market. First, Walmart added the creative vision of innovative Jet.com CEO Marc Lore. Forrester analyst Sucharita Mulpuru recently called Lore the biggest asset in Walmart’s acquisition. “What Walmart needs is an innovation machine that consistently is putting out something new every week,” Mulpuru added. Not only will Jet.com’s business model benefit from Walmart’s vendor relationships, Jet.com gives WMT something it has badly needed: an exciting e-commerce brand. Walmart has spent decades building one of the strongest brands in the world. However, that brand does not represent technology, e-commerce and innovation. No matter what the company does to make Walmart.com better, it will be very difficult for the site to compete with Amazon on reputation. Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA): The Boring Story You Shouldn’t Ignore Jet.com gives Walmart a blank state to get behind an exciting new brand that is synonymous with e-commerce. Jet.com may have gotten off to a late start in its quest to be the top Amazon alternative, but it now has the full weight of Walmart behind it. As of this writing, Wayne Duggan did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT), Kroger’s biggest rival for supermarket customers in most of its major markets, has seen its results rebound. Its stock is on the rise, and the quarterly earnings it reported late last week show Wal-Mart is targeting Kroger (NYSE: KR) and other traditional supermarkets to regain some of the market share that slipped. “Wal-Mart is going on the offensive,” Jim Hagerty, a principal and investment adviser with downtown-based money management firm Bartlett & Co., told me.

That is one of the largest commercial clean energy deals – ever. The Times reports: “In the United States, the generating capacity of corporate clean energy projects has more than doubled each year since 2013, according to the Business Renewables Center at the Rocky Mountain Institute, which tracks publicly announced deals. In 2015, 11 companies signed up for 3.23 gigawatts’ worth of projects, roughly the equivalent of five coal plants and up from 1.18 gigawatts the year before.”   Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 0 Post new comment Name: Sign In or register to use your TDWorld ID Email: Your comment: * Advertisement Related Articles The Big Apple Goes Green Bringing Solar to the Big Apple Apple Asks FERC to Sell Power at Market-Based Rates Supermarkets See Green Energy Growth LA's Novel Green Finance Mechanism Connect Subscribe to The Energy Times Newsletter Subscribe Advertisement LATEST ON ENERGY TIMES Nov 3, 2016 Article Energy Times Brand Bold New Power Vision at Empowering Customers & Cities 2016 Jeremy Rifkin opened up the Empowering Customers & Cities 2016 executive conference with a keynote speech that was part warning, part call to action, and part invitation to rethink the way America generates, buys, sells, and delivers its energy...More Aug 18, 2016 Sponsored Energy Times Brand ABB announces 2016 Automation & Power World digital conference for the power industry ABB Automation & Power World has announced additional details for its upcoming APW digital conference....More Aug 17, 2016 News T&D World Magazine DOE Calls for More Investment for U.S. Energy Emergency Response In his testimony before a field hearing, U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz called for increased investments in U.S. energy emergency response....More Mar 13, 2016 IdeaXchange T&D World Magazine A Different Game Recently, I had the opportunity to watch the U.S. national rugby team play Canada in an international match....More Feb 29, 2016 Article Buildings Are Getting Energy Savvy 1 Building operators are ready to start deploying automated products that will steeply slash their energy consumption, says a government official....More Webinars Spacer Cable vs. Tree Wire Substation Reality Modeling: A New Solution for an Old Problem How to Stay Above Water While Working NERC CIP Cyber Compliance: Driving Cyber Security Priorities  More Webinars Advertisement White Papers Transformer Testing Techniques and Standard Development Enabling a Secure, Reliable and High Performing Field Area Network with Cellular Technology An Assessment of Polyethylene Insulator Performance  More White Papers T&DW Learning Center Handbook of Energy Engineering Calculations SOLVE ENERGY PROBLEMS QUICKLY AND ACCURATELY American Electrician's Handbook Sixteenth Edition For a century, the American Electricians' Handbook has served as the definitive industry reference for...

Police also found a substance in the vehicle suspected to be heroin. The driver was taken into custody, and his car was towed. Friday, Aug. 12 • A woman was suspected of stealing at Wal-Mart. She reportedly abandoned her shopping cart full of merchandise when she realized she was being watched. When she took her cellphone out of her purse, two packages of false eyelashes were visible. Wal-Mart personnel said the woman has stolen from the store before and plan to complete a case file with video. Sunday, Aug. 14 • An officer observed a car pulling out of a gas station with the front end damaged and missing the passenger side front headlight. When running the plates, the officer realized the driver’s license had been suspended. The driver claimed he thought the suspension started on Aug. 16 but was issued tickets and his plates were confiscated. • Police responded to a complaint of larceny. An individual allegedly stole two cans of Four Loko by tucking them under his shirt. When caught, he returned them to the store clerk but will be facing charges. Monday, Aug. 15 • Officers conducted a traffic stop on Central Avenue near West Drulland for a vehicle suspected of having a suspended registration.

The stock had been in the 20% lower circuit limit in the previous two trading sessions. (PTI) Home textile maker Welspun India slumped for a third consecutive day as the issue surrounding an inferior bedsheet variant supplied to one of its customers, Target, has now seen another client Wal-Mart ordering a review. Welspun shares hit the 10% circuit limit on Wednesday at Rs 59.30, a 52-week low. The stock had been in the 20% lower circuit limit in the previous two trading sessions. The sell-off over the past two sessions has wiped off Welspun India’s market cap by over Rs 3,500 crore. The crisis broke after Target, Welspun’s second largest customer, said the company had supplied a variety of bedsheet substituting Egyptian cotton with a cheaper type of cotton. Due to this violation of code of conduct, Target said, it was in the process of ending all business with Welspun. On Tuesday, world’s largest retailer Wal-Mart, which is also one of its customers, said it is also reviewing Welspun’s cotton certification records. “If we discover an issue, we will handle it appropriately,” it said. Welspun India reported a consolidated revenue of Rs 5,937 crore for year-ended March 2016. US customers account for two-third’s of its business. Apart from Target, which accounted for 10% of its business, Welspun’s US customers include Wal-Mart, Bed & Bath and Beyond, Macy’s and JC Penney. Welspun has already announced that it is “appointing one of the big four external auditors to audit supply systems and processes. This is an issue of highest priority for us and we will take all necessary steps to address it.” A mail sent to Welspun on Wednesday seeking further clarifications didn’t elicit a response. “ Export is a big business for Welspun so the implications of this could be huge. If the particular product was also shipped to other clients, this crisis could worsen,” said an analyst at a local brokerage. Edelweiss Securities expects the loss of the contract with Target will lead to a fall in Welspun’s earnings per share for FY17 and FY18 by 11% and 14% respectively. Another brokerage Elara Securities too sees Welspun’s earnings falling by 22%.

Other retail clients like JCPenny and Walmart also start their investigations in to the matter. Post Your Comments Share Cancel Sidhartha Shukla moneycontrol.com Shares of textile major Welspun India hit lower circuit, down 10 percent at Rs 59.50 per share. The stock has already lost 42 percent  (Rs 5,958 crore) of its market capitalisation in last three trading sessions. The panic selling came after US-based Target Corp -- Welspun's second largest customer severed all ties with the company. Target has alleged that Welspun has been selling cheap cotton products to it under the guise of Egyptian cotton for the past two years, between August 2014 and July 2016. On its corporate website Target said," This was a clear violation of both Target’s Code of Conduct and our Standards of Vendor Engagement, and was contrary to the high ethical standards to which we hold ourselves, and our vendors." Target Corp has even gone to the extent of offering a full refund to its customers who have purchased products from its outlets from August 2014 and July 2016. In a BSE release Welspun has said, "We have initiated immediate actions to investigate the root cause. We are appointing an external auditor (one of the big four) to audit our supply systems and processes. This is an issue of highest priority for us and we will take all necessary steps to address it." Other clients to follow suit? Welspun is a major supplier to retailers like Walmart, JCPenny, Bed Bath & Beyond and Macy's. Post these allegations from Target, other retailers like JCPenny and Walmart have started their investigations in to the matter. On Tuesday, Walmart said that it is reviewing Welspun's cotton certification record and plans to hold additional dialogue with the company. Following Walmart's lead, American department store JCPenny has initiated an investigation to look in to products it bought from Welspun. The news of Target's allegations has caused a domino effect which may further aggravate Welspun's existing wounds if other retailers decide to choose the same path Target did. As market analyst, Ambareesh Baliga told CNBC-TV18 that it might be a genuine mistake (from Welspun's end), it is going to impact Welspun's business from other major global clients as well. A big chunk of Welspun's clients are from the US and this fiasco can hurt the company's credibility and raise questions on its business ethics.

Oanh Ha and Rajhkumar K Shaaw Bloomberg NEW! HIGHLIGHT AND SHARE Highlight text to share via Facebook and Twitter Getty Images ADVERTISEMENT Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said it's reviewing Welspun India Ltd.'s cotton certification records, joining Target Corp. to scrutinize the supplier over cheaper bedsheets being passed off as premium Egyptian cotton and sending the Indian company's stock down by daily limits for a second session. The world's largest retailer plans to hold further discussions with Welspun and "handle it appropriately" if any issues are discovered, according to spokeswoman Marilee McInnis. Wal-Mart is Welspun's third-largest customer, behind Target, which said late last week it had pulled sheets and pillowcases off its shelves after discovering they were mislabeled as Egyptian cotton. It also terminated all businesses with the supplier. A Welspun representative didn't immediately have a comment when reached by Bloomberg News. Part of a roughly $3 billion conglomerate headed by Balkrishan Goenka and with interests spanning textiles, steel, pipes, energy and infrastructure, Welspun said it manufactures every fifth towel sold in the US. and counts J.C. Penney Co. and Macy's Inc among its customers. "This is a serious issue," said S.P. Tulsian, who runs investment advisory firm sptulsian.com. "On one hand the company has been talking of $2 billion top-line by 2020 and on the other hand the U.S. is a very big market for them. Now that goal of $2 billion revenue will be difficult to meet." Welspun fell another 20 percent to 65.85 rupees on the Mumbai exchange. The 36 percent two-day slide -- the steepest since 1999 -- cut the company's market value to 66.2 billion rupees ($990 million). Welspun Group said it wants to become one of India's top 50 groups by market value by 2020, according to its website. Sumant Kumar, an analyst at Elara Securities India Pvt., cut his rating on the stock to sell from buy. Goenka's family and group companies hold about 74 percent in the home-textiles supplier, with his wife Dipali Goenka acting as CEO and joint managing director. On Monday, a company connected to founder Goenka bought 500,000 Welspun shares in the open market, according to an exchange filing. Welspun said it's reviewing its supply chain and would hire a "Big Four" accounting firm to examine its processes. The company is engaging with key customers, managing director Rajesh Mandawewala said during a conference call Monday. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., Welspun's biggest customer, and Wal-Mart sell the company's 500 and 800 thread count sheets online under the Crowning Touch label. They retail for as much as $175 a set. "It is likely that other customers too will start raising questions over Welspun's supplies," said Arun Kejriwal, a director at Kejriwal Research & Investment Pvt. in Mumbai. Welspun makes towels, sheets, rugs and carpets for 18 of the top 30 global retailers. Sales to Target amounted to $90 million in the fiscal year that ended in March, or about 10 percent of the company's revenue, the company said. Egyptian cotton, which has a longer fiber that creates a softer thread than other cotton, often carries a higher price because shoppers consider it to be of higher quality.

Penney (JCP). Annie Palmer Aug 24, 2016 2:15 PM EDT NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond  (BBBY)  were higher in mid-afternoon trading on Wednesday as the Union, NJ-based home retail company is appointing an external auditor to review products from Welspun India. The auditor will confirm whether the Mumbai-based textile manufacturer's bedding products are made of Egyptian cotton. Welspun has come under fire for selling cheaper bedsheets as premium Egyptian cotton. The decision follows similar moves by Target (TGT) and Walmart (WMT), who also sell the company's sheets.  Target is pulling the items from its stores, while Walmart is investigating Welspun's cotton certification records.  J.C. Penney (JCP) said yesterday it is also conducting an investigation into Welspun's sheets. The company added that it's too early to "determine what actions may be necessary," Fortune reports.  Separately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its "risk-adjusted" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author. TheStreet Ratings has this to say about the recommendation: We rate BED BATH & BEYOND INC as a Hold with a ratings score of C. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed - some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its attractive valuation levels, good cash flow from operations and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. However, as a counter to these strengths, we also find weaknesses including deteriorating net income, disappointing return on equity and a generally disappointing performance in the stock itself.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel Global retail giant Walmart is reviewing cotton certification records of Welspun India in the wake of Target Corporation's decision to terminate contract with the Gujarat-based textiles maker over alleged lapses in products supplied to it. Confirming that Welspun supplies a number of products to Walmart, a spokesperson of the US retail major said: "We are currently reviewing Welspun cotton certification records and plan to have additional conversations with Welspun. If we discover an issue, we will handle it appropriately." The development follows Target Corp, which had after an extensive investigation, confirmed that Welspun that uses Egyptian cotton to make bedsheets and pillowcases sold by the retailer, substituted another type of non-Egyptian cotton when producing these sheets between August 2014 and July 2016. The retailer had said as soon as its investigation confirmed the substitution, it pulled all remaining product from Target stores and Target.com. "We have informed Welspun that, due to this conduct, we are in the process of terminating our relationship with them," Target Corp said. Welspun on its part had said it has initiated immediate actions to investigate the root cause and was appointing an external auditor to audit its supply systems and processes. Shares of Welspun India were trading at Rs 59.30 on BSE post afternoon, down 9.95 per cent from previous close. The shares had crashed 19.99 percent yesterday to Rs 65.85 - its lower circuit limit - on BSE.

Login Search Wal-Mart Reviews Welspun Records as Target Ends Business August 24, 2016, 07:06:00 AM EDT By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT has reportedly started reviewing cotton certification records of Welspun India, one of its bedsheet suppliers, after peer Target Corp. TGT pulled its Welspun products from shelves, following the discovery that they were mislabeled. Welspun makes towels, sheets, rugs and carpets for 18 of the top 30 global retailers. It manufactures one out of every five towels sold in the U.S. and sells to major customers like J.C. Penney JCP and Macy's, Inc. M , according to Bloomberg. Wal-Mart is Welspun's third-biggest customer, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Welspun currently supplies a number of products, including sheets, to Wal-Mart. However, currently, Welspun is undergoing investigations by Wal-Mart after Target terminated all business with the Indian supplier last week. Welspun India's shares plunged 20% on Tuesday after the announcement. Target stated that its extensive investigation confirmed that Welspun had been selling cheaper sheets and pillowcases as premium Egyptian cotton. Egyptian cotton has a longer fiber that creates a softer thread compared to other cotton. It often carries a higher price because shoppers consider it to be of better quality. WAL-MART STORES Price and Consensus WAL-MART STORES Price and Consensus | WAL-MART STORES Quote Welspun, on its part, said that it was investigating the product specification issue and would hire a Big Four accountancy firm to review its supply processes. The Indian company fears the loss of other customers like Wal-Mart after Target's withdrawal. The Bentonville, AR-based retail giant plans to hold additional conversations with the supplier, and take a call if any issues are discovered. Wal-Mart currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Textile sourced from the company is currently being investigated by global retail majors Walmart and JCPenney for product integrity. (File photo) Global retail majors Walmart and JCPenney are investigating textiles sourced from Welspun India for product integrity, while IKEA is awaiting the outcome of a probe by the Indian firm in the wake of lapses in its supplies to US-based Target. “JCPenney is conducting a thorough investigation of its Welspun textiles to ensure the integrity of its product claims,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. It further said JCPenney suppliers of private and exclusive brand products are required to certify the quality compliance of any raw materials used and, when sourcing Egyptian cotton, manufacturers must provide a certificate issued by the Cotton Egyptian Association as an additional measure of authenticity. On what actions could be taken, the spokesperson said: “It is too early in our review process to determine what actions may be necessary.” A Walmart spokesperson said: “We are currently reviewing Welspun cotton certification records and plan to have additional conversations with Welspun. If we discover an issue, we will handle it appropriately.” A spokesperson of the Swedish furniture retailer IKEA on the other hand said: “To our knowledge and according to our continuous verifying processes, the supplier delivers according to our agreements.” The spokesperson further said: “However, we will follow their ongoing investigation carefully and await the outcome. Until then our business collaboration continues as usual.” IKEA does not buy products made from Egyptian cotton. From the end of fiscal 2015, IKEA reached the goal of 100 per cent cotton from more sustainable sources and Egypt does not have sustainable cotton programs related to Cotton from more sustainable sources, the statement added. Welspun, which was supplying bedsheets and pillowcases made of Egyptian cotton to Target, was alleged by the US-based retailer for substituting another type of non-Egyptian cotton when producing sheets supplied between August 2014 and July 2016. Target has since then decided to terminate its contract with Welspun after an investigation. Welspun on its part has said it has initiated immediate actions to investigate the root cause and was appointing an external auditor to audit its supply systems and processes. Target had said that as soon as its investigation confirmed the substitution, it pulled all remaining product from Target stores and Target.com. “We have informed Welspun that, due to this conduct, we are in the process of terminating our relationship with them,” Target Corp said. Shares of Welspun India tanked 9.95 per cent on BSE, closing the day at Rs 59.30.

That seems kinda cheap to me. I might get this if I see it. I kinda wish they would recolor Minimus Ambus to look like Daniel. I think it'd complete the set. Re: Transformers Generations Platinum Edition Autobot Heroes Set Listed At Wal-Mart.ca (1818327) Posted by mblase75 on August 24th, 2016 @ 2:33pm CDT I wonder why they didn't repaint Minimus Ambus into Daniel. Re: Transformers Generations Platinum Edition Autobot Heroes Set Listed At Wal-Mart.ca (1818334) Posted by Kurona on August 24th, 2016 @ 2:58pm CDT I wonder why they included Minimus at all when Nightstick was removed from Cyclonus in his Platinum set Re: Transformers Generations Platinum Edition Autobot Heroes Set Listed At Wal-Mart.ca (1818337) Posted by Decepticon Stryker on August 24th, 2016 @ 3:05pm CDT Kurona wrote:I wonder why they included Minimus at all when Nightstick was removed from Cyclonus in his Platinum set Well since these are based on the movie which came out before Nightstick I think they just wanted to keep in continuity. That doesn't answer why Minimus is there but does provide a possible reason forr Nightstick's absence.

You wouldnt know you were missing out unless you had him. Minimus is another matter since there is an actual control panel and chair inside Ultra Magnus' chest. Plus, Magnus' head doesnt connect to the bottom, minimus serves as the neck between the Magnus helmet and the chest in terms of the anatomy of the toy's robot mode. Re: Transformers Generations Platinum Edition Autobot Heroes Set Listed At Wal-Mart.ca (1818349) Posted by Black Hat on August 24th, 2016 @ 3:51pm CDT All I really want is that Arcee. And maybe Springer and Ultra Magnus, maybe. I've already got Prime Kup (who's good enough for my purposes) and I don't like that mold as Blurr.

Re: Transformers Generations Platinum Edition Autobot Heroes Set Listed At Wal-Mart.ca (1818371) Posted by Omegatrion84 on August 24th, 2016 @ 5:05pm CDT This set looks really great. I will most likely be picking this up. That being said I do have a few nitpicks with it. Since they included Minimus Ambus why not repaint him as Daniel in his Exo-suit? I'm not a huge fan of the Drift mold repainted into Blurr. The new Titans Return Blurr painted like Takara's would have been perfect. Lastly Arcee didn't get her hand blaster which was in the movie, yet they gave her the IDW swords instead? Also Hasbro seems to have this weird hang up with painting her "bikini bottom" all pink, instead only painting the top half and leaving the bottom white which makes it look more like a belt. This is probably a stock image as I saw Arcee out of package on display at Botcon this year painted as she looks in the movie but the in package figure was presented like she is here. Re: Transformers Generations Platinum Edition Autobot Heroes Set Listed At Wal-Mart.ca (1818433) Posted by Delicon on August 24th, 2016 @ 10:22pm CDT Two thoughts, both on the same general idea. 1) We've had quite a few Kups by now, why are none of them in animation a curate gray colors? 2) I absolutely hate that Blurr head and have since it was first introduced. Since you're going for a movie accurate Blurr and you're limited to repaints, I would have personally used Cybertron Blurr as the head is dead one. Sure, the vehicle mode is pretty different from movie Blurr but no worse than Generations Blurr is.

It's very short, has no leg articulation, and how would you explain away his Cyber Planet key and flight mode? All for what, a better head? Of all the Blurr figures they've made that one is the worst representation.

As for Cybertron Blurr, thats just a retool of Armada Blurr, one of the worst toys I ever held from one of the worst toylines. I rarely sell my toys since I got into collecting but I made an exception with that one. I didnt want that figure in my house.

"JCPenney is conducting a thorough investigation of its Welspun textiles to ensure the integrity of its product claims," a company spokesperson said in a statement. It further said JCPenney suppliers of private and exclusive brand products are required to certify the quality compliance of any raw materials used and, when sourcing Egyptian cotton, manufacturers must provide a certificate issued by the Cotton Egyptian Association as an additional measure of authenticity. On what actions could be taken, the spokesperson said: "It is too early in our review process to determine what actions may be necessary." A Walmart spokesperson said: "We are currently reviewing Welspun cotton certification records and plan to have additional conversations with Welspun. If we discover an issue, we will handle it appropriately." A spokesperson of the Swedish furniture retailer IKEA on the other hand said: "To our knowledge and according to our continuous verifying processes, the supplier delivers according to our agreements." The spokesperson further said: "However, we will follow their ongoing investigation carefully and await the outcome. Until then our business collaboration continues as usual." IKEA does not buy products made from Egyptian cotton. From the end of fiscal 2015, IKEA reached the goal of 100 per cent cotton from more sustainable sources and Egypt does not have sustainable cotton programs related to Cotton from more sustainable sources, the statement added. Welspun, which was supplying bedsheets and pillowcases made of Egyptian cotton to Target, was alleged by the US-based retailer for substituting another type of non-Egyptian cotton when producing sheets supplied between August 2014 and July 2016. Target has since then decided to terminate its contract with Welspun after an investigation. Welspun on its part has said it has initiated immediate actions to investigate the root cause and was appointing an external auditor to audit its supply systems and processes. Target had said that as soon as its investigation confirmed the substitution, it pulled all remaining product from Target stores and Target.Com. "We have informed Welspun that, due to this conduct, we are in the process of terminating our relationship with them," Target Corp said. Shares of Welspun India tanked 9.95 per cent on BSE, closing the day at Rs 59.30.

By Lauren Schwahn, NerdWallet August 24, 2016 Save for later Saved Walmart department manager Karren Gomes helps stock shelves with school supplies as the retail store prepare for back-to-school shoppers in San Diego. Mike Blake/Reuters/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Many brick-and-mortar stores are watching their profits slowly crumble to the ground, thanks to the internet. With the ease of online shopping and fast, free shipping from subscription services like Amazon Prime  and Wal-Mart’s ShippingPass , some consumers are shying away from physical retail locations. Shoppers prefer stores to the web for now, but online shopping is growing at a fast pace. E-commerce sales jumped 15.5% in the first quarter of 2016 compared with a year earlier, while total retail sales increased by only 2.2% during that time, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce . Some companies are shutting down branches due to lack of profit. Kmart and Sears  are in the process of closing 78 locations, and Macy’s recently announced  plans to close about 100 stores. But retailers are finding creative ways to make in-store shopping more enticing and prevent it from becoming obsolete. Recommended: How secure is your data? Take our quiz and find out “There’s no store customer or e-commerce customer, there’s just customers, and customers shop increasingly as they want,” says Dan Evans Jr., Nordstrom’s business public relations director. “For us to grow and evolve as a company, we need to have a real sense of urgency around staying relevant.” Test your knowledge How secure is your data? Take our quiz and find out Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/22 Retailers know that relevance revolves around technology these days. That’s why many have taken steps to become more up-to-date. Here’s a look at some of their tactics, how they work to your advantage and where they fall short. 1. Interactive kiosks Retailers are attempting to turn stores into more engaging spaces by incorporating elements of the online shopping experience, including screens that mimic smartphones and computers. Macy’s  has tested kiosks in some of its top-performing department stores, including those at Easton Town Center in Columbus, Ohio, and New York’s Herald Square. These touch-screen centers perform a range of duties, from completing in-store pickups to providing tourism information. Kiosks can be helpful if you can’t find a sales associate or if you’d rather shop solo. The benefits: You can browse through merchandise and information and potentially complete transactions by yourself. And there’ll likely be no line, so you can get in and out of the store quickly. The drawbacks: In many ways, this experience is no better than shopping online — except, of course, you don’t get to sit on the couch in your pajamas. 2. Creating a cell phone haven Companies hope that if mobile users’ needs are met, they’ll spend more time — and money — in stores. Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic offer free Wi-Fi to shoppers. So do the Apple Store and Target . But Wi-Fi is no good unless your mobile device is charged enough to use it. Some businesses have you covered there, too. Through its partnership with ChargeItSpot, Neiman Marcus has installed phone-charging stations in a majority of its stores; customers can lock up their phones and charge them while they shop. The benefits: With a full battery and access to Wi-Fi, you can compare prices, browse your favorite websites and check your social media feed without eating up your data. The drawbacks: Retailers don’t always have the fastest internet connection. Plus, privacy is a concern. Is the network secure? Is the store collecting your data? Check the terms of use before you connect. 3. Apps and web tools Almost every retailer now has its own free app that shoppers can use at home and in stores. American Eagle Outfitters, Nordstrom, J.C. Penney  and Victoria’s Secret  are just a few examples. Apps can keep track of your coupons and rewards points at specific stores. With some, you can get reviews and more information about a product by scanning its bar code with your phone’s camera. If you’re in the store and an item is out of stock, these apps can tell you whether it’s available at other nearby locations. Macy’s is taking mobile use a step further. At 10 locations, the department store is rolling out a browser web tool dubbed Macy’s On Call, which uses IBM’s artificial-intelligence platform Watson as an in-store guide for shoppers. Customers can ask for directions to a certain product or department, and they’ll get an answer on their phone. The benefits: You’ll have all the resources you need at your fingertips. These tools make applying discounts and navigating the store more convenient. The drawbacks: Apps take up storage space on your phone, so they might not be worth downloading if you’re an infrequent shopper. And whether you use an app or your browser, retailers can track your shopping behavior for marketing purposes. 4. Smart fitting rooms At some stores, you’ll even find technology in the fitting rooms. For example, some have mirrors that let you create a virtual catalog of sorts, featuring yourself as the model. High-end retailer Neiman Marcus has installed full-length “memory mirrors” at select locations, including San Francisco’s Union Square. You just need to enter your email address and create a PIN to use them. These mirrors are more like screens that use cameras to capture pictures and shoot 360-degree videos, so shoppers can get a complete view of the outfits they try on. Customers can also scroll through inventory and send the images to their email addresses or share them with friends for a second opinion. Other places, like Bloomingdale’s, have tablets in their dressing rooms. These let customers find an item in another size or color or request help from an associate. The benefits: Smart mirrors let you compare ensembles side by side, and because they “remember” the images, you won’t have to try on the same outfit multiple times. Tablets are a little less high-tech but still offer convenience. The drawbacks: Again, security might be an issue. Stores have measures in place to protect your privacy, but they could be gathering data, and breaches do happen occasionally. 5. Mobile POS It’s become commonplace for staff to get in on the digital action as well. Chains across the nation, including Lowe’s and Nordstrom , have staff members equipped with mobile point-of-sale devices such as iPhones or tablets. Using these, they can search for inventory, scan price tags, place orders or swipe your credit card when you’re ready to check out. “Our hope is that we can use technology in a way that makes the experience a customer chooses as seamless as possible” says Evans, the Nordstrom public relations official. The benefits: The mobile POS enables fast, one-on-one customer service. It’s almost like having a personal shopper; associates can help you find what you’re looking for online if the store is out of stock or bring the register to you so you don’t have to wait in line. The drawbacks: You may feel pressured to transact, and the speedy checkout process means you’ll have less time to rethink your purchase. Why shop in stores? There’s no doubt that online shopping is convenient and efficient, but there are advantages to shopping in the physical world. Thanks to technological advances, you can shop smarter and more independently in stores than ever before, plus you still have the option to consult an employee if you need assistance. And you’ll get a truer sense of how an item looks, feels or fits in person than you will from a website. As long as shops feel e-commerce sales breathing down their necks, you can expect that they’ll work harder to improve your experience.

These Retail Stores Are Open On Thanksgiving Day Watch Stocks In Vogue How Overtime Pay Ruling Affects Wal-Mart, Dollar Tree, Fast Food (Investor's Business Daily) Baird provided its outlook on Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT), after meeting with key members of Walmart-U.S. and IR. "With 8/7 consecutive quarters of positive comps/traffic, momentum has clearly returned to Walmart-U.S," wrote Baird, stating that progress has been steady/broad-based across the store and country as investments in associates, processes, and price are working together to drive improved customer satisfaction and sales. According to the analysts, while absolute valuation metrics are nearing highs (~16.5x NTM P/E), relative reads (vs. S&P500/Staples) are more consistent with historical trends, and positive comp/traffic momentum appears poised to continue with several productivity initiatives still on tap. The analysts maintained their Outperform rating and $80 price target.

In so doing, Walmart broke nine quarters of slowing growth online and buoyed hopes that it is better equipped to compete with Amazon.com. Broadly speaking, the strong online performance was the result of years and billions of dollars in investment Walmart has made to bolster its digital offerings. Everything from the roll-out of its Walmart Pay mobile app, to expanding its free grocery pickup service for orders placed on line to launching an Amazon Prime-like subscription service. “The distinctions that we talk about today between stores, apps, pick-up, delivery and sites are continuing to blur into the background for customers. For them, it’s just Walmart,” Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. Here are five Walmart digital initiatives that are behind its improved e-commerce fortunes: 1. Bigger assortment online 2. Online grocery 3. Prime-like subscription service 4. Walmart Pay 5. Staff raises Click here for or background on each of these initiatives and the full article, "Here's How Walmart Is Reigniting Its E-Commerce Growth."

Welspun, which was supplying bedsheets and pillowcases made of Egyptian cotton to Target, was alleged by the US-based retailer for substituting another type of non-Egyptian cotton when producing sheets supplied between August 2014 and July 2016. Target has since then decided to terminate its contract with Welspun after an investigation. Welspun on its part has said it has initiated immediate actions to investigate the root cause and was appointing an external auditor to audit its supply systems and processes. A Walmart spokesperson said: "We are currently reviewing Welspun cotton certification records and plan to have additional conversations with Welspun. If we discover an issue, we will handle it appropriately." A spokesperson of the Swedish furniture retailer IKEA on the other hand said: "To our knowledge and according to our continuous verifying processes, the supplier delivers according to our agreements." The spokesperson further said: "However, we will follow their ongoing investigation carefully and await the outcome. Until then our business collaboration continues as usual." IKEA does not buy products made from Egyptian cotton. From the end of fiscal 2015, IKEA reached the goal of 100 per cent cotton from more sustainable sources and Egypt does not have sustainable cotton programs related to Cotton from more sustainable sources, the statement added. Target had said that as soon as its investigation confirmed the substitution, it pulled all remaining product from Target stores and Target.Com. "We have informed Welspun that, due to this conduct, we are in the process of terminating our relationship with them," Target Corp said. Shares of Welspun India tanked 9.95 per cent on BSE, closing the day at Rs 59.30.

Many believed a big-box store, like Costco or Walmart, would take the place of the 312-unit below-market-rate complex, but it remained a mystery. In March, City Paper reported LG had a “firm agreement with an anchor tenant” prior to announcing the evictions. And now, according to an announcement last month, it appears that anchor tenant is Whole Foods Market.  In response, a small group of advocates have decided to boycott the grocery store, citing what they see as a disregard for Pittsburgh’s affordable-housing struggles. “Do we need another Whole Foods more than the Penn Plaza residents needed the relationships and accessibility of being in centrally located affordable housing?,” says Joy KMT, who helped start the boycott effort. But will the Whole Foods boycott make a difference? So far, about 300 people have signed up for the boycott on Facebook, and KMT says the group may hold demonstrations. KMT says the group doesn’t have the capacity to “actively recruit” new members, but she welcomes more to join the Facebook group. “I think that we have to start looking at communities as more than an assortment of buildings and land to be developed,” says KMT. “If we begin with different questions, then we will end with different answers.” Whole Foods Market spokesperson Annie Cull is aware of the boycott and wrote in an email that Whole Foods “recognizes that this effort is a part of the overall conversation happening about the ongoing development of the neighborhood.”  “The East Liberty community has been going through a major revitalization over the last several years, and Whole Foods Market is a very small part of it,” she wrote. John Delaney, a University of Pittsburgh business-administration professor and labor expert, says while some boycotts have been more effective than others, the strategy overall has tended to have only “moderate” effectiveness. “The success of a boycott often depends on the salience of the issue in dispute to the people who might buy from a boycotted merchant,” Delaney wrote in an email to CP. “In the [Whole Foods case], the issue will be whether the dispute fueling the boycott of Whole Foods will be important enough to customers to create economic damage.”   CP talked to six shoppers at the current East Liberty Whole Foods on Centre Avenue (the grocer has indicated it will not keep both locations), and only half were aware of plans for a new store. Most cited more parking as a potential benefit of the new store. All said they would shop at the new location when complete, except for one respondent who said she preferred the current location because it was more “Shadyside-y.” Only one of the six was familiar with the Penn Plaza affordable-housing saga. When asked about potential problems with the new location, he said “You know what happened over there was bad,” before indicating that he would still shop at the new store. But should a boycott be directed toward Whole Foods, the property’s tenant, or LG, the owners? KMT says yes, considering Whole Foods’ stated mission to promote community involvement. Whole Foods’ website states, “Caring for the communities in which we reside is hugely important to our organization.” “I think that it would be important for Whole Foods to advocate for and protect vulnerable populations in the communities which they serve,” says KMT. “Whole Foods is actively seeking to profit from the displacement of families, and that is against the values that they have set forth to guide their company.” Whole Foods is not new to the neighborhood — the Centre Avenue location has been in East Liberty since 2002. But even though the store has been part of the area for more than a decade, KMT says its decision to express interest in and occupy the site that was the last unsubsidized, below-market-rate apartment complex in the neighborhood should carry weight. “Developments like this can’t work without the cooperation of many, from governmental agencies to private developers to corporations,” says KMT. “As an anchor store in East Liberty, the choices that Whole Foods makes absolutely do matter.” Cull, of Whole Foods, said that the company would not be leading a community-collaboration effort, but directed CP to LG’s larger plans for the former Penn Plaza site. Jonathan Kamin, the attorney representing LG, didn’t respond to request for comment on the developer’s plans.  Construction of the new East Liberty Whole Foods is slated for the first quarter of 2017.

Brian Stoffel (TMFCheesehead) Aug 24, 2016 at 6:30AM Image source: Getty Images Though many shoppers don't know it, Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) e-commerce efforts have been under way for more than a decade. And while it is far and away the most powerful brick-and-mortar retailer in the world, its efforts to adapt in the age of the internet have lagged significantly behind those of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other competitors. Last year, the king of e-commerce generated six times more Internet-based revenue than Wal-Mart. That's a big reason why Wal-Mart is willing to fork over $3.3 billion in the recently announced acquisition of e-commerce start-up Jet.com. On the surface, the decision to acquire Jet seems logical: It shows investors that Wal-Mart is serious about upping its e-commerce game. Jet has shown remarkable growth in its one year of operations, particularly with urban millennials. With the acquisition, Wal-Mart gains access to (1) Jet's proprietary technology, which is responsible for offering customers attractive savings, and (2) Jet's accomplished CEO, Marc Lore. But the more time I spend thinking about it, the more I believe Wal-Mart is throwing money away -- and that's bad news for shareholders. Risk-taking 101, from a Nobel laureate Nobel laureate Daniel Kahnman's Thinking, Fast and Slow is a gold mine for those interested in behavioral economics. In one of the book's sections, he lays out a simple framework to understand when and why individuals (and companies) are willing to take risks -- particularly when they actually aren't in an individual's best interests. Imagine that you are given two options: 1. A guaranteed result 2. A bet for a more favorable outcome. The two variables at play are (1) how likely you are to win, and (2) whether you are gaining or losing money as a result.   ... for Gains ... for Losses High Probability ... 90% chance to win $100 or guaranteed $80 payout RISK AVERSE, accept payout 90% chance to lose $100 or guaranteed loss of $80 RISK SEEKING, go for bet Low Probability ...  10% chance to win $100 or guaranteed $15 payout RISK SEEKING, go for bet  10% chance to lose $100 or guaranteed loss of $15 RISK AVERSE, accept payout loss Author's version of graphic from Thinking, Fast and Slow, by Daniel Kahnman. Studies have found individuals typically exhibit the behavior that's in the bold, capital letters. Critically, that is the worse of the two choices on a strictly rational basis. For the purposes of this article, we are focused on the upper right-hand corner: a high probability for losses. If you have a 90% chance of losing $100, the value of taking that bet -- over time -- is negative $90 (90% times $100). It would be better for you to choose a guaranteed loss of $80. But Kahnmen says that we are suckers in our hope to avoid losses, and we're likely to reject this favorable guarantee. As he states [emphasis added]: "Many unfortunate human situations unfold in the top right cell ... Risk taking of this kind often turns manageable failures into disasters."  What this has to do with Wal-Mart I would argue that Wal-Mart is in the upper right-hand square when it comes to an e-commerce strategy. It is clearly losing to Amazon and doesn't have many options to stem the tide. While Wal-Mart's earnings, released earlier this month, showed encouraging growth in e-commerce, the long-term trends are still decidedly negative. More alarming, however, was the fact that Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon was willing to pay over $3 billion for Jet. To put that in perspective, Wal-Mart has $7.7 billion in cash on hand. Even though the company has strong free cash flow with over $21 billion over the past twelve months, that's 40% of the company's cash poured into the acquisition -- not an insignificant amount. And though Jet.com has shown remarkable growth, it is hard to imagine any path to profitability for the company. Even if it does achieve profitability, it is even harder to see that profitability significantly moving the bottom line at a massive company like Wal-Mart. Looking to the future Perhaps the most important metrics at play are sustainable competitive advantages. Amazon's raison d'etre is to be the best customer service company in the world, especially when it comes to order fulfillment and shipping speeds. To that end, it currently has 80 domestic fulfillment centers, with plans to add 32 more. As best I can tell, Jet only has two (in Kansas and New Jersey), and Wal-Mart has between seven and 12 . Those fulfillment centers are crucial, because they help guarantee that Amazon can get packages to Prime members as quickly as possible, typically two days or less. Wal-Mart and Jet fans are quick to point out that Jet also offers such guarantees on shipments from its fulfillment centers, and even for products not shipped from Kansas or New Jersey, Jet pressures third-party suppliers for similar guarantees. The problem is that the delivery and logistics game is rapidly changing. Five years from now, Amazon may be able to offer one-day shipping, or even same-day delivery. Drone deliveries get closer and closer to becoming a reality, and with over 100 locations, there's simply no way Wal-Mart or Jet could offer the same type of customer service from just 10 to 15 fulfillment centers. Some argue that Wal-Mart and other brick-and-mortar players could transition the use of their physical locations into quasi-fulfillment centers. Wal-Mart currently has over 780 million square feet of retail space domestically when Sam's Club is included. When Amazon's known build-out plan is completed, it will have just under 100 million square feet. It would seem that Wal-Mart has the upper hand. But what investors need to recognize is that the company would have to cannibalize its physical retail space -- the bread and butter that pays the bills -- in order to capitalize on such an opportunity. It would be a bold move, but management has given no concrete indications that it is a move the company is willing to make. In much the same way that we now find it unconscionable to wait 10 seconds for a website to load when just 10 years ago that seemed like lightning fast connectivity, I see a future where same-day or even next-hour delivery is the norm. Whether or not that actually pans out isn't the point: Amazon -- in addition to having a huge head start -- also has far more optionality to stay ahead in the e-commerce industry. At the end of the day, I'm not sure what the right move for Wal-Mart would be. But I do know that as far as shareholders are concerned, there's a high probability that Jet.com's $3 billion price tag will never be justified by additions to Wal-Mart's bottom line.

Wal-Mart is Welspun India's third largest client. LINK The exchanges, BSE and NSE, have lowered the daily permissible trading price limit of the stock to 10% from 20% with effect from Wednesday. The stock of Asia's largest home textile maker is currently trading at its fresh 52-week low, falling 42% in past three trading sessions from Rs 102.85 on August 19, after US-based Target Corp announced last week it was terminating business with the Indian manufacturer for substituting the cotton in bedsheets with a different type than the contracted Egyptian one. Welspun India said that it has initiated actions to investigate the root cause. “We are appointing an external auditor (one of the Big four) to audit our supply systems and processes. This is an issue of highest priority for us and we will take all necessary steps to address it,” the company said on Saturday. Elara Capital recommends investors to reduce their positions in the near term, given lower visibility of earnings. In the medium to long term, we expect earnings to recover as the company focuses on improving its quality control processes and better sourcing of cotton, Elara Capital said in event update. Management failed to assuage concerns on how Target’s internal audit and third-party quality checks appointed by it failed to raise any alarms over a period of two years, it added. Till 09:29 am, a combined 234,638 equity shares changed hands on the counter and there were pending sell orders for 25.91 million shares on the NSE and BSE.   Advertisement << Previous Article   «Back Most Read Ratan Tata's ego caused financial mess for group firms: Cyrus Mistry Demonetisation: Problem of plenty for RBI as banks park record Rs 4.32 lakh crore Demonetisation: Union Minister latest victim as hospital declines to accept old notes Supreme Court refuses to stay petitions against demonetisation No transaction charges on debit card payments: Govt More From Markets ICICI Prudential MF's attraction story Fall below 7,900 could take Nifty to 7,500-7,600 levels Profit-sharing deals with PEs will need shareholders' nod Sesame output likely to fall 40% due to unfavourable climate Impact of demonetisation largely priced in: Ridham Desai [ more ] Top Stories Rs 1 lakh crore shaved off Tata group cos' m-cap since Mistry's ouster F C Kohli debunks Mistry's TCS sale claim SBI cuts bulk deposit rates by 1.25-1.9% Jan Dhan accounts see spurt in money flow after demonetisation Gold loses most liquid asset status [ more ] Markets Rs 1 lakh crore shaved off Tata group cos' m-cap since Mistry's ouster Gold loses most liquid asset status Impact of demonetisation largely priced in: Ridham Desai Sebi allows FPIs to invest in unlisted corporate bonds Sugar prices at wholesale market fall by Rs 55 per quintal in New Delhi [ more ] Companies Start-ups gear up to raise fresh funds under liberalised ECB regime Wadia sends third notice to Tata Sons Mistry knows where all the bodies are buried in Tata Group: Kumar Rs 1 lakh crore shaved off Tata group cos' m-cap since Mistry's ouster F C Kohli debunks Mistry's TCS sale claim [ more ] Opinion Gujarat Gas results set off downgrades Expect lower growth at Eicher Reliance Industries valuation at 10-yr low Don't revive inspector raj Resolving a disagreement [ more ] Latest News Start-ups gear up to raise fresh funds under liberalised ECB regime Finders can't be keepers Wadia sends third notice to Tata Sons Taxation: Kuldip Kumar Mistry knows where all the bodies are buried in Tata Group: Kumar [ more ] Today's Paper Rs 1 lakh crore shaved off Tata group cos' m-cap since Mistry's ouster Zara's recipe for success: More data, fewer bosses Debit card charges dropped, farmers to get easier cash access We should have 5 million customers by 2020: David Mcmillan, Aviva Europe Pakistan's jihad makers [ more ] News you can use Demonetisation: Stricter norms for NRIs Spread equity investments over three-four months Deposits above Rs 2.5 lakh: Don't panic if you receive the I-T notice Expect your household budget to shoot up: Going cashless comes at a cost Opportunities amid chaos New Balance created its PR crisis.

Penney Co. now reviewing items to verify product claims. Shares dropped 10 percent Wednesday to a low of 59.30 rupees in Mumbai. The company has lost as as much as 43 percent of its market value this week, the worst performance among India’s top 200 companies. J.C. Penney, the manufacturer’s fifth-biggest customer, said the company is reviewing its Welspun products.

It also terminated all business with the supplier. Part of a roughly $3 billion conglomerate headed by Balkrishan Goenka -- with interests spanning textiles, steel, pipes, energy and infrastructure -- Welspun now faces one of its worst crises since being founded 30 years ago. Welspun said it’s reviewing its supply chain and would hire a “Big Four” accounting firm to examine its processes. The company is engaging with key customers, managing director Rajesh Mandawewala said during a conference call Monday. The company manufactures every fifth towel sold in the U.S. and counts Costco Wholesale Corp. and Macy’s Inc among its customers. Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, is reviewing Welspun’s cotton certification records and plans to hold further discussions with the manufacturer. The chain is also reviewing its other suppliers of Egyptian cotton products out of an abundance of caution, spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said Tuesday. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

These Blue Chip Shares Have Crashed; Should You Buy? Posted By: Sunil Fernandes Updated: Wednesday, August 24, 2016, 6:35 [IST] Subscribe to GoodReturns It is almost impossible to get good quality shares at low prices, especially when the markets are at a near 1-year high. However, there are some blue chip stocks that have crashed in the last few weeks and are available at attractive prices. Take a look at some such stocks. Infosys Shares in Infosys a day ahead of its results on July 14, was quoting at Rs 1,175. The stock is almost 20 per cent lower than its 52-week high price of Rs 1279 hit only in June 2016. The results of most IT companies for the quarter ending June 30, 2015 were a disaster. Infosys also had a contract cancelled by the Royal Bank of Scotland, which further led to selling pressure on the stock.  At Rs 1030, the stock is close to a 52-week low of Rs 1009.   Welspun India This is one of the major suppliers of towels and textiles to reputed global chains including Walmart, J C Penney and Target. It is a highly profitable and solid dividend paying company. In the last two-days, the stock has crashed 36% after Target Corporation said that it was severing ties with the company and pulling out Welspun products from its stores and its website. This is because the company substituted bedhshets and pillow cases with non Egyptian Cotton. Analysts are worried that other companies like Walmart may follow, which could be bad for the stock. Shares were down 36% in 2 days and there could be a further fall.   Aditya Birla Nouvo This is another stock that has crashed in the recent weeks. The stock which was quoting at a comfortable levels of Rs 1650 in early Aug,  has now fallen to Rs 1255, after a merger was announced into Grasim. Analysts did not like the scheme of merger and sold heavily into the stock. The share price has now stabilized at the Rs 1250 levels. State Bank of Mysore This share came crashing down after the merger ratio was decided by State Bank of India. It turned out to be unfavorable to State Bank of Mysore. The stock has fallen 12 per cent since Aug 8. Just Dial This stock has been consistently falling, not over the last few weeks, but, certainly over the last few months. Analysts are worried over the growth momentum at the company. The stock had a 5-week high of Rs 1076 and has now halved to Rs 470. Lupin From a high of Rs 1750 in early Aug, Lupin shares are down to Rs 1530. Pharma shares in general have crashed as worries over US FDA approvals continue. Lupin's growth has left investors worried as the share already commands a high p/e multiple. Disclaimer The article is not a solicitation to buy, sell in securities or other financial instruments.

Kedar Aziz Muhammad, 22, is charged with murder in the death of Rechard Delane Mickle, 35. Charlotte-Mecklenburg police were called to the Walmart on the 8100 block of South Tryon Street Saturday at 9 p.m. in reference to a shooting. When they arrived, officers said they only found an abandoned vehicle.  At that point, no one had been taken to area hospitals. A few hours later, Mount Holly police called CMPD and said a a man, later identified as Mickle, had been dropped off at CaroMont Regional Medical Center with gunshot wounds. He was pronounced dead by medical staff. Police said evidence led them to believe Mickle was shot in the Walmart parking lot hours before. Investigators have not released a possible motive for the shooting, or said what led them to naming Muhammad as a suspect. Anyone with further information about the incident is asked to call 704-432-TIPS, or Crime Stoppers at 704-334-1600. Copyright 2016 WBTV. All rights reserved.

Walmart on Coors NW was evacuated while firefighters and workers from NM Gas worked to fix a gas leak Tuesday afternoon. (Courtesy Albuquerque Fire Department) ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — A gas leak at a westside Walmart lead to the brief evacuation of about 1,000 customers and employees Tuesday afternoon, according to a spokeswoman for the Albuquerque Fire Department. Melissa Romero said the leak occurred when a two inch line was struck during a digging project at the southwest corner of the Walmart on 2550 Coors NW. Firefighters and personnel from the gas company arrived at the scene shortly before 3 p.m. “NM Gas responded quickly and clamped the line,” she said. “All employees and customers have been allowed back in the building.” Advertisement Continue reading Share Tweet LinkedIn Print Subscribe ABQnews Seeker Albuquerque News News Suggested Stories: West Side Gas Leak Evacuates Homes – Jul 23, 2012 UPDATED: Firefighters Respond to Gas Leak in SUB – Oct 9, 2012 APD evacuated because of suspected gas leak – Feb 25, 2015 Blast tears off part of hotel after manager evacuates guests – Aug 19, 2015 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

With the ease of online shopping and fast, free shipping from subscription services like Amazon Prime and Wal-Mart’s ShippingPass, some consumers are shying away from physical retail locations. Shoppers prefer stores to the web for now, but online shopping is growing at a fast pace. E-commerce sales jumped 15.5% in the first quarter of 2016 compared with a year earlier, while total retail sales increased by only 2.2% during that time, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. Some companies are shutting down branches due to lack of profit. Kmart and Sears are in the process of closing 78 locations, and Macy’s recently announced plans to close about 100 stores. But retailers are finding creative ways to make in-store shopping more enticing and prevent it from becoming obsolete. “There’s no store customer or e-commerce customer, there’s just customers, and customers shop increasingly as they want,” says Dan Evans Jr., Nordstrom’s business public relations director. “For us to grow and evolve as a company, we need to have a real sense of urgency around staying relevant.” Retailers know that relevancy revolves around technology these days. That’s why many have taken steps to become more up-to-date. Here’s a look at some of their tactics, how they work to your advantage and where they fall short. 1. Interactive kiosks Retailers are attempting to turn stores into more engaging spaces by incorporating elements of the online shopping experience, including screens that mimic smartphones and computers. Macy’s has tested kiosks in some of its top-performing department stores, including those at Easton Town Center in Columbus, Ohio, and New York’s Herald Square. These touch-screen centers perform a range of duties, from completing in-store pickups to providing tourism information. Kiosks can be helpful if you can’t find a sales associate or if you’d rather shop solo. The benefits: You can browse through merchandise and information and potentially complete transactions by yourself. And there’ll likely be no line, so you can get in and out of the store quickly. The drawbacks: In many ways, this experience is no better than shopping online — except, of course, you don’t get to sit on the couch in your pajamas. 2. Creating a cell phone haven Companies hope that if mobile users’ needs are met, they’ll spend more time — and money — in stores. Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic offer free Wi-Fi to shoppers. So do the Apple Store and Target. But Wi-Fi is no good unless your mobile device is charged enough to use it. Some businesses have you covered there, too. Through its partnership with ChargeItSpot, Neiman Marcus has installed phone-charging stations in a majority of its stores; customers can lock up their phones and charge them while they shop. The benefits: With a full battery and access to Wi-Fi, you can compare prices, browse your favorite websites and check your social media feed without eating up your data. The drawbacks: Retailers don’t always have the fastest internet connection. Plus, privacy is a concern. Is the network secure? Is the store collecting your data? Check the terms of use before you connect. 3. Apps and web tools Almost every retailer now has its own free app that shoppers can use at home and in stores. American Eagle Outfitters, Nordstrom, J.C. Penney and Victoria’s Secret are just a few examples. Apps can keep track of your coupons and rewards points at specific stores. With some, you can get reviews and more information about a product by scanning its bar code with your phone’s camera. If you’re in the store and an item is out of stock, these apps can tell you whether it’s available at other nearby locations. Macy’s is taking mobile use a step further. At 10 locations, the department store is rolling out a browser web tool dubbed Macy’s On Call, which uses IBM’s artificial-intelligence platform Watson as an in-store guide for shoppers. Customers can ask for directions to a certain product or department, and they’ll get an answer on their phone. The benefits: You’ll have all the resources you need at your fingertips. These tools make applying discounts and navigating the store more convenient. The drawbacks: Apps take up storage space on your phone, so they might not be worth downloading if you’re an infrequent shopper. And whether you use an app or your browser, retailers can track your shopping behavior for marketing purposes. 4. Smart fitting rooms At some stores, you’ll even find technology in the fitting rooms. For example, some have mirrors that let you create a virtual catalog of sorts, featuring yourself as the model. High-end retailer Neiman Marcus has installed full-length “memory mirrors” at select locations, including San Francisco’s Union Square. You just need to enter your email address and create a PIN to use them. These mirrors are more like screens that use cameras to capture pictures and shoot 360-degree videos, so shoppers can get a complete view of the outfits they try on. Customers can also scroll through inventory and send the images to their email addresses or share them with friends for a second opinion. Other places, like Bloomingdales, have tablets in their dressing rooms. These let customers find an item in another size or color or request help from an associate. The benefits: Smart mirrors let you compare ensembles side-by-side, and because they “remember” the images, you won’t have to try the same outfit on multiple times. Tablets are a little less high-tech but still offer convenience. The drawbacks: Again, security might be an issue. Stores have measures in place to protect your privacy, but they could be gathering data, and breaches do happen occasionally. 5. Mobile POS It’s become commonplace for staff to get in on the digital action as well. Chains across the nation, including Lowe’s and Nordstrom, have staff members equipped with mobile point-of-sale devices such as iPhones or tablets. Using these, they can search for inventory, scan price tags, place orders or swipe your credit card when you’re ready to check out. “Our hope is that we can use technology in a way that makes the experience a customer chooses as seamless as possible” says Evans, the Nordstrom public relations official. The benefits: The mobile POS enables fast, one-one-one customer service. It’s almost like having a personal shopper; associates can help you find what you’re looking for online if the store is out of stock or bring the register to you so you don’t have to wait in line. The drawbacks: You may feel pressured to transact, and the speedy checkout process means you’ll have less time to rethink your purchase. Why shop in stores? There’s no doubt that online shopping is convenient and efficient, but there are advantages to shopping in the physical world. Thanks to technological advances, you can shop smarter and more independently in stores than ever before, plus you still have the option to consult an employee if you need assistance. And you’ll get a truer sense of how an item looks, feels or fits in person than you will from a website. As long as shops feel e-commerce sales breathing down their necks, you can expect that they’ll work harder to improve your experience.

Macquarie Strategist Viktor Shvets thinks technology, too much debt, and adverse government policy are responsible for a bleak future. (Courtney Sacco/Odessa American via AP) Do you feel something is wrong with the United States and the global economy? Despite a respectable recovery and low unemployment, many people aren’t happy with their current economic situation or their outlook for the future. From rising prices for basic necessities or schooling, to harsh competition and low pay for lower income jobs, to negative interest rates—the poor and the middle class all have their problems to deal with. Experts in the government and central banks are trying to manage a suboptimal situation but cannot isolate the problem, let alone offer solutions. Or maybe they know what’s wrong but don’t want to talk about it because the truth is too shocking. Enter Viktor Shvets, the global strategist of the investment bank Macquarie Group. He not only dares to think outside the box but also isn’t afraid to openly voice his opinions, which are fascinating and shocking at the same time. Read More The Clinton and Trump Economic Plans: Growing the State or the Private Sector “The private sector will never recover, it will never multiply money again,” he told Epoch Times. His main theme is the “declining return on humans,” which means that in today’s digital world, normal humans don’t grow productivity fast enough to justify more jobs and higher wages as the machines are taking over. It takes time to line up machines, and this time we are replacing humans altogether. — Viktor Shvets, global strategist, Macquarie Group The UBS Stamford, Conn., trading floor in 2008 (L) and in 2016. (UBS Publicity Image; @anilvohra69) “There is no productivity on a global basis. Secular stagnation, technological shifts, monetary policy, all are suppressing productivity growth rates,” he said. But what about technology making humans more productive? Shvets says this was true in the first and second industrial revolution, when displaced jobs, such as the horse-cart driver, eventually morphed into higher-tech and higher-productivity ones, like the taxi driver. However, in this, the third industrial revolution, machines are not augmenting humans, they are replacing them. The self-driving car will completely eliminate the driver. And even in the previous, more-mechanical industrial revolutions, it often took decades for productivity growth to recover and for jobs to come back, and only after higher-productivity sectors dominated the majority of the economy. “We are now on the sharp end of the technology S curve. It started in the late 1970s, it’s picked up in the last 5 to 10 years, productivity growth rates go down, not up. It takes time to line up machines, and this time we are replacing humans altogether,” he said. And not only lower-skilled jobs like taxi drivers are threatened. Just look at the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, where you can barely see a human specialist trader anymore. The machines in New Jersey have taken over the trading. (Macquarie Group) Of course, there are companies and sectors in which machines augment people’s productivity, but they are in the minority and also always teeter on the edge of machines replacing humans completely.  “Parts of the economy become extremely competitive, the rest becomes far less competitive. Walmart’s two million employees are less productive than the few hundred thousand people working for Amazon,” said Shvets. Walmart’s revenue per employee was $220,000 at the end of the second quarter of 2016, compared to $1 million per employee at Amazon. As a result, total productivity growth has been negative in the United States for at least a decade, according to the Federal Reserve Board of San Francisco. The so-called Total Factor Productivity fell almost 2 percent annualized in the second quarter of 2016. (Total Factor Productivity, source: Macquarie Group) Leverage In order to counter falling productivity, households and companies, as well as the government, have taken on unsustainable amounts of debt to keep consumption going. “When the economists say we can continue to leverage, as we have done in the last three decades, it lacks understanding of the balance sheet. Even at zero interest rates, at a certain level of debt, you go bankrupt because the private sector loses confidence in the system,” said Shvets. This is the phenomenon of a balance-sheet recession, where the whole balance sheet of the economy must shrink in order to restore confidence in the system and return to private-sector business cycles. Japan is the most famous case; its balance-sheet recession is now 25 years old. But the United States and Europe essentially have the same problem. Since the beginning of 1980, total debt in the United States has increased by a factor of 14 to $63.5 trillion, while GDP has only increased by a factor of 6.2. The debt is not spread evenly, we still live in a tribal world, and it’s easier to start a war than to forgive debt. — Viktor Shvets, global strategist, Macquarie Group Shvets says the world should have actually delevered or paid down the debt to return initiative to the private sector, but thinks people could not accept the levels of pain associated with doing that. “You could eliminate the impact of the overcapacity through deflation. Nobody is prepared to accept that we might have to wipe out decades of growth just to eliminate leverage. Banks go, there are defaults, bankruptcies, layoffs,” he said. (Source: St. Louis Fed.) He thinks the biblical debt jubilee, when slaves would be freed and debt would be forgiven every 50 years, is a nice idea that would also work today if it weren’t for entrenched special interests. “The debt is not spread evenly, we still live in a tribal world, and it’s easier to start a war than to forgive debt,” Shvets said. Global central banks, with their easy money policies of negative interest rates and quantitative easing, are working against a debt deflation scenario, with limited success, according to Shvets. “That was the entire idea of aggressive monetary policies: stimulate investment and consumption. None of that works, there is no evidence. It can impact asset prices, but they don’t flow into the real economy,” he said. “Remember, the people at the Fed and the Bank of England are not supermen, they are people with an above average IQ trying to do a very difficult job in a highly complex environment.” Both overleveraging, easy-money policies and technological shifts are responsible for increasing levels of income inequality across the globe—another hallmark of the previous two industrial revolutions. Fewer people control more of the wealth. According to the World Bank, the U.S. GINI coefficient, which measures inequality, rose from 37.7 in 1986 to 41.1 in 2013. In China, it rose from 27.7 in 1984 to 42.1 in 2010. The higher the coefficient, the higher the concentration of income among a group of people. (Macquarie Group) The Rise of the State So if the private sector won’t recover until most of the debt gets written off, which won’t happen because neither the people nor the elite want it to happen, who is left to pick up the slack? “Nobody has visibility; private sector signals have died. The private sector has no idea what to do. The more aggressive the public sector becomes, the less visibility the private sector has. They don’t spend and invest the way they should,” said Shvets. According to him, the state will take over—it’s only a question of how. If you are dominated by the public sector, then investment in the traditional sense is no longer possible. — Viktor Shvets, global strategist, Macquarie Group “You are essentially in the world where public sector signals dominate,” he said, giving the example of how it’s the global central banks that are moving markets more than earnings or trade data. “If the private sector refuses to multiply the money, then the state will do that.” This move toward the state brings its own issues, however. “The public sector doesn’t have cycles like the private sector. Investment theory evolved around cycles. If you are dominated by the public sector, then investment in the traditional sense is no longer possible.” Business-cycle theory centers around the expansion and contraction of money and credit, as well as business activity, earnings, and stock valuations. If money and credit are abundant, businesses invest, expand, and hire people; consumption picks up, so company profits improve. Stocks tend to rise in tandem with an expansionary cycle. Viktor Shvets, global strategist of Macquarie Group, in an interview with Bloomberg, in this undated screenshot. (Bloomberg) This is not true for the state; public investment in infrastructure and central banks printing money create a super cycle, with a huge bust at the end. The S&P 500 is trading at an all-time high despite the second most expensive valuations since the 1999 stock market bubble and despite the fact that total S&P 500 earnings fell during every reporting period since the third quarter of 2015. The market is banking on the Fed to turn on the money spigot again, at any time. “The public cycle is aligned with politics. People always avoid radical solutions, so they are doing a little bit here, a little bit there, to keep the Humpty Dumpty on the wall,” said Shvets. Eventually, if the private sector doesn’t recover and the state assumes more power, Shvets thinks countries will move toward fascism and communism again, just like in the 1920s and 1930s, when the economic framework was comparable to today’s. The state will decide where capital goes — Viktor Shvets, global strategist, Macquarie Group “Younger people like communism because it is inclusive, paints a bright picture of the future. Nobody believes it, but it looks good and young people don’t have anything to lose. Older people tend to be more racist, less inclusive, protectionist, anti-immigration, rather than believe the bright future of everyone holding hands together in a sunny place,” said Shvets. Either way, the outcome could be similar to what took place in the 1930s in Europe and the United States—less globalization and more power to the state. “The pendulum is definitely swinging towards the state, and the state will decide where capital goes,” said Shvets. One way or another it will have to take on most of the private sector debt, maybe through the nationalization of banking and insurance industries. “It’s impossible to see how you can unwind the economy’s debt load any other way.” Nevertheless, there are some government programs that Shvets thinks could enhance human productivity and benefit the private sector, like government research and development (think of NASA in the 1960s), as well as re-skilling and retraining programs that would enable workers to compete with machines. In the long-term, Shvets thinks that biotechnology could play a role in that process, but we are a long way off. How to Invest Despite all these challenges, Shvets still recommends that his clients invest in certain types of stocks. “The outcomes of the next 10 to 15 years could be quite dramatic. How do you invest in that climate? There are only two ways of investing. The first is, assume non-mean reversion. The private sector will never recover. The only thing left would be the public sector cycle.” This means we can conveniently forget about corporate profits, or valuations like the price-earnings ratio of the S&P 500, as many investors already have. The only thing that matters is public sector activity in the form of central bank intervention or government stimulus programs. If that is the case, gold goes back $100 per ounce. — Viktor Shvets, global strategist, Macquarie Group An extreme example of this cycle is perhaps Venezuela. While the country is going up in flames, people don’t have enough food, and the currency is dissolving itself in a vicious hyperinflation, the stock market has actually gone up 10 times since the beginning of 2012. Only recently has reality caught up with stocks, and the market has given up 15 percent of its gains since the beginning of the year. “Buy quality sustainable growth, high returns on equity. Companies capable of generating a high return on equity through margins and without leverage. Don’t worry about the price-to-earnings ratio, there is no mean reversion,” said Shvets. “And don’t own any financials.” Good advice. The stock price of the likes of Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse have been decimated this year. The share prices of Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Credit Suisse AG (CSGN) have both lost almost 50 percent of their value this year (Source: Google Finance) The other option is to invest along some pretty grim themes that benefit from the new trends identified by Shvets. “People are still going back to 20th-century thematics, it’s so old-fashioned.” None of the new trends can be described as inspirational or uplifting, but the Macquarie portfolio reflecting the themes has bested the MSCI World Index by almost 30 percent since the beginning of 2015. “The biggest theme is declining return on humans; the replacement of humans; biotech; augmentation of humans; opium for the people, like computer games and gambling,” Shvets said. Performance of the Macquarie Group Thematics portfolio (Macquarie Group) Then there are themes catering to geopolitical risk and potential regional wars or civil uprisings, like detention and prison centers, weapons, and drones. Another theme supports the aging demography in the West, so companies holding hospitals, funeral operators, and psychiatric institutions should do well. On the positive side, Shvets notes technological disrupters like Amazon and Google. All those companies should be independent of the government and long-term structural shifts. “They go on no matter what.” If readers shy away from profiting from these themes, there is always gold. Related Coverage What Is Going On With US Stocks? “If you think of gold, the only way gold loses is if normal business and private sector cycles come back. If that is the case, gold goes back $100 per ounce. The other outcomes deflation—stagflation, hyperinflation—are all good for gold.” As for a return to a gold standard, Shvets has more bad news: “Gold standards come back after the war, not before the war.” Editor’s Picks China’s Growing Trade Deficit with US, Rising State and Corporate Debt: Very ‘Concerning’ Says Congressional Report What Trump’s Presidency Means for Health Care Sector Grass-Roots and Professional, Anti-Trump Protests Seek Healing and Political Change Receive Our Epoch 10 Newsletter Important stories from around the world, in your inbox daily.

(Academy.com) Work is underway on a new Academy Sports + Outdoors at an empty Walmart at Memorial Parkway and Drake Avenue in Huntsville. The Texas retailer confirmed today it will launch a 63,000-square-foot store at the site, which is being developed by RD Management of New York. The building has been vacant since fall 2014 when Walmart moved from the property to a new facility on 3031 Memorial Parkway S.W. Academy, which is also expanding in Florence, said the new Huntsville store will bring 100 jobs to the area. "We're looking forward to opening next year and continuing to be an active member of the Huntsville community," said Ken Attaway, Academy Sports + Outdoors executive vice president and chief operating officer.  Redevelopment concept plan for the former Walmart site at Memorial Parkway and Drake Avenue in Huntsville. (RDManagement.com) In addition to footwear and apparel, the Huntsville store will have team sports and golf products, patio sets, barbecue grills, and hunting, fishing and camping equipment and gear. The chain also will provide multiple services, including scope mounting, bore sighting, line winding/spooling, propane exchange, racquet stringing, hunting and fishing licenses, and local team clothing and novelty items. Academy currently has more than 210 locations in 15 states. The nearest stores are on U.S. 72 in the Madison area and Wimberly Drive in Decatur. A redevelopment concept plan of the property on the RD Management website shows up to 36,000 square feet of additional retail at the site, which has a two-way average traffic count of 93,000 cars per day. Demographics show there is a population of 63,419 and average household income of $65,137 within three miles of the development. "There is nothing new to announce at this time," said Thomas Mirandi, vice president of real estate for RD Management. "As soon as we have updates, we will share them with you."

Walmart, Home Depot Relying More On Physical Stores To Complete Online Orders Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart, Home Depot Relying More On Physical Stores To Complete Online Orders Image courtesy of Nicholas Eckhart August 23, 2016 3:09 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler where's my stuff? walmart home depot inventory online orders stores retail fulfilling orders Walmart’s recent $3 billion acquisition of e-commerce company Jet.com may have been the retailer’s way of spurring its online business, but the largest retailer in the world has already been mingling its physical stores with its online presence. Much like fellow big box store, Home Depot, Walmart has increasingly used its vast network of stores to fulfill online purchases.  Business Insider reports that in addition to five large distribution centers and 100 small e-commerce facilities across the country, Walmart now uses 80 of its 4,500 stores in the U.S. as areas to pack and ship orders placed online. As with its purchase of Jet.com, Walmart appears to be using its physical store order fulfillment as a way to keep up with Amazon, which has 180 fulfillment centers across the country. By using the physical stores, Walmart is able to spread out orders, matching inventory to the area in which orders are being shipped. This could also help the company in fulfilling its Amazon Prime competitor — the $50/year Shipping Pass, which offers two-day shipping on products. Like Walmart, Home Depot has begun to rely more on its physical stores to package and either ship or hold online orders for pickup. About 42% of the retailer’s online orders are picked up at physical stores, Business Insider reports. That figure will likely grow, CEO Craig Menear says, with the complete launch of “BODFS,” or “buy online and deliver from store.” The program allows customers to pick a shortened delivery option that sends orders directly to a local store. So far, BODFS has launched at 700 of Home Depot’s 2,200 stores. The system seems to be a bit of a contrast from Home Depot’s previous push to cut back on the amount of inventory it holds in-store. In June, the retailer said it would start keeping inventory levels flat or slightly down, and instead depend on distribution centers for online sales.

Travis B. Taylor, 36, of Blakely, Ga., Melissa A. Sinquefield,30, of Buford and Jocelyn Gerstenlauer, 19, of Auburn are accused of using "movie set" money to purchase approximately $1,000 worth of lawn equipment, which was then returned to a different store for a cash refund, according to a news release. In an afternoon update Tuesday, police said Gerstenlauer has turned herself in, and Sinquefield was "aware of the warrants and has made plans to turn herself in in the upcoming days." Taylor is accused of passing the fake money, which was marked with "for motion picture use only," at Gerstenlauer's cash register. Gerstenlauer never returned to work after a loss prevention officer at the Wal-mart, which is located on Sardis Church Road, discovered the bills in her drawer. Sinquefield returned the merchandise to the store on Ga. 20 near I-985 later that day, July 19. Taylor is accused of a similar crime in Early County (where Blakely is located), and has active warrants in that jurisdiction. Authorities believe Taylor and Sinquefield have left metro-Atlanta, and could be in Early County. Taylor, Sinquefield and Gerstenlauer are all charged with first degree forgery; Sinquefield also faces charges of theft by deception and violation of her probation. Anyone with information on any of the suspects' whereabouts is asked to contact Gwinnett County Police.

Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today Teachers don't often get the adulation they deserve, so when a stranger thanked seventh grade teacher Sabrina Drude for what she was doing for underprivileged kids and showered her with an unexpected gesture of kindness, she could not help but burst into happy tears. Before the start of every school year, Drude would shop for supplies for her students at Wal-Mart. This year, she was noticed by a man standing in line at the counter, according to CBS News. Drude's cart was filled with notebooks, pencils, and markers, and the man behind her was curious why she had so many school supplies. Drude, who is a teacher at Francis Scobee Middle School in San Antonio, Texas, explained to the man that she is teaching in a very low socioeconomic area, where kids cannot always afford to buy their own supplies. Touched by Drude's concern for the children, the man offered to pay for her items. But Drude declined, saying she could not accept his money. When $97 flashed on the cash register, the man named Lester Brown would not take "no" for an answer. "He said, 'Put your wallet away,' and I just started crying," Drude shared. "That's the sweetest thing I've ever heard." The teacher could not understand why anyone would do something nice to a complete stranger like her. Brown explained to her that it's "because teachers don't get the recognition that they deserve." Drude is grateful to Brown, and she plans on telling her students about the kind man who paid for their school supplies. "This is exactly the type of person I want to influence my kids to be," said Drude, who plans on inviting Brown to join her class for a pizza party. "I want him to inspire my kids just like he inspired me; if any of my kids grew up to be half the man he is I'd be very proud."

The Gloves are Off: Walmart (WMT) Beating Amazon (AMZN) At Its Own Game? Walmart’s (WMT) entry in the online retail market is giving Amazon.com (AMZN) a run for its money. August 23, 2016 WSP The world’s larger retailer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is using its massive chain of stores to outperform Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the online grocery segment and its efforts are paying off. Walmart is actually giving Amazon a run for its money by introducing a slew of new pickup stores for convenient deliveries. In a pre-recorded earnings call last week, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said the company just added 30 more grocery pickups in the US markets during the second quarter. The service is now available to more than 60 markets and virtually 400 locations in and around the US. “It’s gratifying to see how much this service helps our customers save time,” McMillon said. Walmart’s online grocery service works by enabling customers to place their grocery orders online. Customers can choose the time to pick up the orders and then pull in a designated parking area when arriving at a Walmart store. From there, an attendant will load up the groceries to the customer’s car. The grocery chain is not done yet. A source familiar with the matter said the conglomerate is bent on rolling out the service to additional markets. But don’t expect Walmart to do heavy promotions on the service-the company wants to grow it from a grassroots perspective. It seems like the strategy is working. Pictures of smiling customers started cropping up all over social media, most are young mothers. Approximately 90% of online users are repeat customers. The service is appealing to millenial moms in particular with baby products and diapers consistently being top sellers. Some of the most frequently ordered items are dairy, produce, and meats. The reason why Walmart’s online grocery service is so popular among young mothers is that the service enables them to get out of the house with the baby in tow, pop their trunk once they arrive in store and have someone load the ordered items up. Despite the onslaught of e-commerce, Walmart is able to keep up with its rivals, particularly its nemesis Amazon, thanks to a strong urban concept and robust contributions from perishable goods. Walmart recently posted an excellent second quarter earnings, exceeding the street’s expectations. The retail chain also raised its annual guidance even as competitors were struggling to generate decent numbers. Walmart is also benefiting from the shutting down of poor performing stores and altering its merchandise combination. In addition, in-store sales open to more than one year were up for the 8th consecutive quarter. Walmart recorded a net income of $3.8 billion, up 8.6% from last year’s comparable quarter. The world’s largest retailer also reported EPS of $1.21, well above analyst estimates of $1.02. Although online sales are affecting volumes of brick and mortar chains, Walmart is countering it by offering new deals, smoother service and building an experience that its online service lacks. The company is also working to increase wages, revamp stores, and develop workplace culture to boost sales.

The foundation will award grants between $25,000 and $200,000 to Indiana nonprofit organizations that help underserved populations. The grant will fund programs that focus on hunger relief and healthy eating, career opportunity, disaster preparedness and community engagement. The foundation awarded $595,000 earlier this year to 13 Indiana non-profit organizations for their programs that address hunger and food insecurity in communities throughout the state. “At Walmart, our mission is to create opportunities so people can live better,” said Marlene Hunter-Lammie, regional general manager, in a statement. “In addition to the thousands of community service hours our associates perform and the in-kind donations that are spread throughout the communities we serve, these grants allow us to help local nonprofit organizations fulfill their mission and continue on their path of service.” The Walmart Foundation was founded in 2008 and is helped by associate-led State Advisory Councils to identify needs within their state, review grant requests and make funding recommendations to the Foundation. Applicants must have a current 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status in order to be eligible for a grant. Applications are only accepted online at http://corporate.walmart.com/_foundation_/apply-for-grants/state-giving-program. The deadline to submit grant requests is Friday, September 2 at 11:59 p.m. TheStatehouseFile.com is a news website powered by Franklin College journalism students.

The last few quarterly reports have been marked by falling revenue and slipping sales at comparable stores, and Q2 wasn’t exactly one for the books when it came to physical retail. Or maybe it was — but not the books retailers would like to revisit. In a segment that was weak on the whole, consumer electronics were among the weakest links in the chain. Target took a beating from shareholders after it notched another lackluster earnings performance — a performance that CEO Brian Cornell said was at least partially attributable to weakness in consumer electronics, and particularly Apple products. Walmart, on the other hand, managed to pull off its second quarter of relative strength in a weak field, but even Big Blue reportedly sluggish consumer interest in tablets, TVs and smartphones. Today it was Best Buy’s turn at the plate. Though many analysts were predicting a rude shock to the other Big Blue’s investors when the results hit today, it seems numbers were better than expected. Revenue was up, and so were same store sales. Investor confidence spiked in early hours trading — the company’s stock priced bounced up 16 percent as Best Buy forecasts end of the year strength that will (slightly) more than counterbalance the rocky start of early 2016. So how did Best Buy beat The Street, and is the outlook a lot better than it was last week?   By The Numbers  Best Buy had a lot of green arrows to report to its investors this morning when numbers for the second quarter of the year hit the wires. Revenue clocked in at $8.53 billion — about $5 million more than a year ago, beating analysts’ $8.39 billion average estimate. Net income was also on the rise, up to $198 million, or 61 cents per share in Q2 , a notable increase of $164 million, or 46 cents per share, from a year earlier. Profit was 57 cents a share, excluding some items, the Richfield, Minnesota-based company noted Tuesday in a statement, and well in excess of the 43 cents/$8.40 billion average that analysts were predicting. “We continue to expect the slight revenue decline in the first half to be offset by slight growth in the back half,” Chief Financial Officer Corie Barry noted in a statement that accompanied the earnings release. Best Buy’s revenue pickup snaps a long cold spell. The firm had seen revenues decline for the previous three quarters before this latest report’s turnaround. The electronics retailer also managed some growth where declines were expected, though in both cases the the numbers were small. Same store sales growth managed to stay in positive territory with 0.8 percent growth — not exactly a barnburner of a number, but a lot better than the 0.6 decline the experts had been looking to see. The largest U.S. consumer electronics retailer also forecast revenue of $8.8-8.9 billion and a profit of 43-47 cents per share for the third quarter. Best Buy also managed big growth in its online channels. At 24 percent, it was well ahead of the growth Walmart notched (11.8 percent) and the U.S. average eCommerce growth rate of about 15 percent. So investors enthusiasm in early hours trading is pretty understandable; Best Buy is notching growth numbers when there was every reason to expect it wouldn’t.   Fighting Gravity  Best Buy’s strength comes at a time and in a segment where competitors online (especially Amazon) and in the physical world (especially Walmart) are coming on particularly strong. Amazon’s Prime Day was a retail even in itself, and it sent a lot of customers to the web looking for brilliant bargains on competitor sites. Best Buy also showed strength in consumer electronics, where its competitors are struggling. Consumer enthusiasm for wearable technology, appliances and home theater gear seemed to more than balance out the relative softness in smartphones and tablets. CEO Hubert Joly is also widely credited for undertaking an aggressive and organized program to both close underperforming stores and better optimize the retailer’s existing store and warehouse infrastructure. Charlie O’Shea, an analyst at Moody’s Investors Service, said Best Buy’s online sales growth of 24 percent was “impressive,” and noted that Joly had demonstrated that proper management can make a big difference to the fortunes of struggling retail players. “[Best Buy’s second-quarter performance] is evidence that a well-managed brick-and-mortar retailer with a well-thought-out strategy that successfully utilizes its physical assets can thrive as it transitions to a true multi-channel retailer,” O’Shea noted. The fact that Best Buy is managing some legitimate growth in a tough atmosphere raises interesting questions, because Best Buy is not an anomaly. Walmart and TJX are also big-store retailers who are effecting at least something of a turnaround and keeping consumers coming in. Can Best Buy keep it up? It’s hard to say. The answer is likely dependent on how consumers feel about consumer electronics during the holiday season. But those appliance sales are eye-catching, since they sync up with what Home Depot and Lowe’s are reporting as well. It’s worth watching to see if Best Buy can keep riding the waves as they come.

The supermarket chain, which has 626 stores across the U.K., recently confirmed on Twitter that Apple Pay is something it is "currently trialling in a few of our stores," but it remains unclear if the testing will lead to a wider rollout in the future. A few Asda customers have recently tweeted about the newly enabled Apple Pay support at superstore locations in Aberdeen, Scotland and Ferring, a small village located about 60 miles southwest from London, England. @Hyperglaucoma Thanks, I believe this is something we're currently trialling in a few of our stores. Thanks, Beth— Asda Service Team (@AsdaServiceTeam) August 15, 2016 As recently as August 12, a support representative tweeted that Asda does not currently accept Apple Pay, but that it does accept contactless payments in some of its stores. Apple Pay generally works where contactless payments are accepted, but some retailers have specific policies against accepting Apple Pay. In 1999, Asda was purchased by Walmart, which recently completed a nationwide launch of its own QR code-based mobile payments solution Walmart Pay in the United States. Walmart was initially committed to the Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX) consortium and its now indefinitely postponed payments service CurrentC. In related news, Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank, and digital banking service B introduced Apple Pay support for cardholders in the U.K. last week.

Is this an acronym or is that a real word that means something to the british people? Because I am only aware of the American Sleep Disorder Association. And hopefully these stores don't put people to sleep :D From Wikipedia... In 1965, when the Asquith brothers approached Associated Dairies to run the butchery departments within their small store chain, a merger was proposed. So they joined together with Noel Stockdale, Arthur Stockdale's son, to form a new company, Asquith + Dairies = Asda (capitalised from 1985). Rating: 3 Votes Jme Saunders 13 weeks ago It's also important to know, unlike in the USA where launch partners are needed as the adoption of contactless isn't as common... ASDA will be supporting *all* contactless payments. Rating: 2 Votes peterh988 13 weeks ago Supermarkets have been slow at implementing Contactless. Tesco has only just recently started accepting it. Sainsbury's don't support it yet. ASDA have a very small trial. It's only Waitrose and M&S that have been offering contactless for some time (and Apple Pay since it launched). At first I thought it was about data grabbing on your shopping habits, but everyone has a loyalty card to do that these days, so you don't really need the payment method to do that. You'd think stores would want to make it as easy as possible for people to spend as much as possible in the way they prefer.

Rating: 1 Votes Planey28 13 weeks ago The infrastructure for contactless is already in place and widespread here, it doesn't take much effort to accept Apple Pay. Stubbornness and own brand schemes are the only real obstacle. (I'm looking at you, Tesco) They'll all come around eventually. Tesco take it in all of their express stores now - it's just the bigger stores that are yet to take contactless. Rating: 1 Votes tmiw 13 weeks ago ASDA pretty much has to due to upcoming Visa and MasterCard requirements that every store in Europe supports contactless payment. Since there's no such requirement for the US, it's no surprise that most stores simply aren't bothering to enable it.

The AtlanticAugust 23, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Democrats and Republicans seem to have a difficult time agreeing on just about anything these days. But one place where they have found common ground: the now defunct Glass-Steagall Act—which once kept commercial and investment banking separate. (It did so by preventing investment banks from taking deposits and mandating that only 10 percent of a commercial bank’s income could come from securities.) The post-Great Depression financial regulation was passed in 1933, and was effectively repealed in 1999. Both presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, have included plans to reintroduce the bill in their economic platforms. The argument for the act is that it could have prevented (or at least dampened) the 2008 financial crisis, and that reinstating it could ward off future ones. Is that the case? The Atlantic’s editors reached out to economists and experts in financial regulation to ask them why Glass-Steagall is seeing renewed popularity right now, and what they think would make America’s financial system safer in the future. Recommended: When T.G.I. Friday's Loses Its Flair The responses below have been lightly edited for clarity. Robert Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and former Secretary of Labor from 1993 to 1997 Some argue Glass-Steagall wouldn’t have prevented the 2008 crisis because the real culprits were non-banks like Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns. But that's baloney. These non-banks got their funding from the big banks in the form of lines of credit, mortgages, and repurchase agreements. If the big banks hadn’t provided them the money, the non-banks wouldn’t have got into trouble. And why were the banks able to give them easy credit on bad collateral? Because Glass-Steagall was gone. I’ve also heard bank executives claim there’s no reason to resurrect Glass-Steagall, because none of the big banks actually failed. This is like arguing lifeguards are no longer necessary at beaches where no one has drowned. It ignores the fact that the big banks were bailed out. If the government hadn’t thrown them lifelines, many would have gone under. Their balance sheets were full of junky paper, non-performing loans, and worthless derivatives. They were bailed out because they were too-big-to-fail. And the reason for resurrecting Glass-Steagall is we don’t want to go through that ever again. My conclusion: We need to resurrect Glass-Steagall. We also need to bust up the big too-big-to-fail banks. Their platoons of lawyers are already busily rolling back Dodd-Frank. Stephen G. Cecchetti, a professor at Brandeis International Business School and Kermit Schoenholtz, the director of the Center for Global Economy and Business at NYU Stern School of Business Recommended: Sometimes, Getting to Church With a Baby and a Full-Time Job Is Just Too Hard In the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007-2009, voters want assurance that the U.S. financial system is safe and that the government will not be tempted again to bail out the country’s banks and bankers. Some people blame the crisis on the 1999 repeal of the 1934 Glass-Steagall Act, which had segmented investment and commercial banking in an effort to limit risk taking. In our view, however, separating investment and commercial banking would not have prevented the financial crisis, and its re-imposition will not prevent the next one. What made the crisis so deep were practices that were completely legal and have little to do with Glass-Steagall. For example, many financial institutions that depended heavily on short-term funding operated with very few liquid assets and almost no capital. Some of the largest firms also used derivatives that allowed them to conceal extraordinary risks. The scandal is that many risky behaviors remain insufficiently addressed. To make finance safe—to prevent runs, credit crunches, and the need for government bailouts—the financial system must be made more resilient to disturbances that undermine the balance sheets of intermediaries. This means requiring greater capital and liquidity buffers, treating the activities of financial intermediaries alike regardless of who is performing them (whether it is a bank, a money market fund, or some other type of “shadow bank”) and modernizing the financial plumbing (including short-term financing mechanisms, collateral rules, and derivatives trading). These changes, combined with a streamlining of the U.S. regulatory apparatus itself, will reduce the incentives to take risks that trigger crises and bailouts, while making the system capable of absorbing the potentially large and unforeseen shocks that will inevitably come. Unfortunately, regulators face powerful opposition from politically connected financial intermediaries and their clients, all of whom benefit from high leverage and implicit, taxpayer-financed, government support. Viewed from this perspective, the focus on Glass-Steagall is a damaging distraction from the job of designing and implementing effective reforms that truly make our financial system safe. John Berlau, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute Recommended: Al-Qaeda Has Been at War With the United States for 20 Years Election years are a time when politicians put on their favorite pair of rose-colored glasses and make future plans with an idealized view of the past. This year, that shiny object for many in both parties is Glass-Steagall. Glass-Steagall is touted as being of progressive origins, reining in big Wall Street banks, and bringing stability to the financial sector. But none of these claims square with reality. First, the law’s sponsors, Senators Carter Glass of Virginia and Henry Steagall of Alabama, were not progressives but “Dixiecrats” who championed the “Jim Crow” segregated American South. Glass helped design Virginia’s poll tax and literacy test for the express purpose, in his own words, of ensuring “the complete supremacy of the white race in the affairs of government.” Glass’s horrific views on race don’t translate into him being automatically wrong on everything else, but they do at least warrant much more skepticism of his other ideas on public policy. Second, since Glass-Steagall forbade “Main Street” commercial banks from venturing into investment banking, it actually protected Wall Street investment banks such as Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs from competition, enabling them to get bigger. Through the 1980s, the Securities Industry Association, a trade group for investment banks, lobbied and litigated against any loosening of the law. And in the end, it was pure investment banks such as Bear and Lehman Brothers—neither of which had merged with commercial banks—that were the first dominoes to fall in the financial crisis. “In the financial industry, policy makers have mistakenly thought an answer to ensuring stability is to limit competition.” To really curb the problem of “systemic risk”—or banks that are “too big to fail”—we must bring to the financial sector what virtually every other field of American business possesses: competition. Companies such as Borders and Blockbuster once dominated their industries but their implosions—while difficult for employees and stockholders—didn’t trigger a crisis. This is largely because competitors were standing ready to absorb demand from their customers. But in the financial industry, policy makers have mistakenly thought an answer to ensuring stability is to limit competition. Since 2010, federal regulators have approved only two new banks to operate in the U.S. Before then, even in the depths of the savings-and-loan crisis, more than 100 new banks per year would get the green light from regulators to open. Also, unlike virtually every other industrialized nation, the U.S. effectively bans non-financial corporations from owning bank affiliates. During the George W. Bush administration, some of the best-run American corporations—including Walmart, Home Depot, and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway—tried and failed to get regulatory approval to create banking units. By contrast, in the United Kingdom, one out of eight pounds [units of currency] are taken from the cash machines of Tesco Bank, a division of the retail giant Tesco. And Canada and Mexico have allowed Walmart to operate the very banking units there that were denied to them by regulators here. Financial stability can also be bolstered by creating special bankruptcy laws for the financial sector and limiting taxpayer-backed deposit insurance for the wealthiest savers, but allowing more competition must be at the forefront of any true financial reform. Sheila Bair, president of Washington College and former Chairperson of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) under President George W. Bush Repeal of Glass-Steagall, by itself, did not cause the crisis but it did exacerbate it. Glass-Steagall repeal was part of a broader movement in the late 1990s and early 2000s toward the idea of “self-correcting” markets—that banks knew better than regulators how to manage risk and regulate themselves. Even more damaging than Gramm-Leach-Bliley was the Commodity Futures Modernization Act which essentially made derivatives markets out of bounds for any regulatory authority—including the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and state insurance regulators. New “risk-based” capital standards, which provided highly generous capital treatment for mortgage-backed securities, derivatives contracts, and other risky assets, encouraged mega-banks to take on excessive levels of leverage and load up on assets which were in fact, high-risk. As a result, investment banks, in particular, had little cushion to absorb losses when the housing market turned and mortgage losses mounted. And those hundreds of billions of losses on the underlying mortgages translated into trillions of losses on derivatives contracts. It is important to understand that not all supporters of reinstating Glass-Steagall are financial reformers. There is some (quiet) Wall Street support as well. I think their hope is that by forcing investment banks to separate from commercial banking, the investment banks would once again be free of prudential oversight by the Fed. “There is too-big-to-fail and then there is simply too big.” To be sure, Glass-Steagall repeal gave birth to larger, more complex institutions which were “too big to fail” given the regulatory tools available during the crisis. So, even if repeal did not drive the crisis, it certainly contributed to the need for bailouts of these behemoths. Another negative outcome of Glass-Steagall repeal, which is frequently overlooked, is the increase of political and market power by the mega-banks. There is too-big-to-fail and then there is simply too big. Politicians, media, think tanks—all are influenced in one way or the other by these powerful financial institutions. And given their tremendous market influence, even large corporations can be fearful about taking them on. Pre-Gramm-Leach-Bliley, the commercial banks and investment banks were frequently fighting with each other and offsetting each other’s agendas in Congress. You no longer have that dynamic. I’m supportive of reinstating Glass-Steagall—particularly if it separates derivatives dealing from commercial banking. I don’t think that is an activity that should be included in the safety net and backed by things like FDIC insurance. But even more important is a dramatic strengthening of capital requirements for large banks, using a “leverage ratio,” not a risk-based capital standard. Risk-based rules do not work—they are static when risks are dynamic, subject to political influence and gaming by banks through their risk models. A 10 percent minimum leverage ratio—meaning that a mega-bank would have to fund itself with at least 10 percent equity and no more than 90 percent debt—would be the most effective thing we could do to stabilize our financial system and make sure that it is resilient during times of economic stress. Helen Garten, a former law professor at Rutgers University The rise of populism in both political parties and lingering anti-bank sentiment after the recession have fueled the movement to reinstate Glass-Steagall. Nostalgia is a factor as well. There is a perception that, back in the day of Glass-Steagall (the 1930s through the 1990s), financial institutions were simpler and safer, protecting us from financial crises. This perception is inaccurate, unfortunately. First, the wall between investment banking and commercial banking constructed by Glass-Steagall was crumbling as early as the 1960s as a result of industry innovation and regulatory encouragement. By the time Glass-Steagall was finally repealed in the late 1990s, banks were already in the securities business. Second, Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the financial crisis of 2008. Lehman and AIG were not part of diversified bank holding companies. Excessive risk taking by banks occurred in mortgage lending and securitization, both permitted under Glass-Steagall. Finally, although the end of Glass-Steagall did facilitate some mergers between large banks and securities firms, consolidation in the banking industry and the resulting "too big to fail" problem was a serious regulatory concern long before the statute's repeal. It's impossible to go back to 1933. The complexity and interconnectivity of our financial markets are a reality, and managing risk requires a more nuanced approach than simply restoring Glass-Steagall. Some new techniques are already in place, including enhanced capital and liquidity requirements. The challenge for regulation is to find ways to improve banks' internal controls. One approach is to encourage large banks to simplify their complex and interconnected legal and business structures, which will facilitate regulatory oversight and enable more efficient resolution in the event of a failure of one or more units. Ironically, the result of simplification may be greater separation of different financial businesses within diversified banks, an internalized twist on the original Glass-Steagall model. Alex Tabarrok, the director of the Center for Study of Public Choice and the Bartley J. Madden Chair in Economics at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University When Black Lives Matter calls for a restoration of the Glass-Steagall Act we know that the Act has exited the realm of policy and entered that of mythology. No, restoring the Glass-Steagall Act would not end racism. Nor would restoring Glass-Steagall have done much, if anything, to have avoided the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner was correct when he said the problems at the heart of the financial crisis had “nothing to do with Glass-Steagall.” The financial crisis is best understood as a run on the shadow banking system, that collection of financial intermediaries who based their credit creation not on deposits but on repo, money market funds, structured investment vehicles, asset-backed securitizations and other financial structures. Separate commercial and investment banking? Please. The problem was that by 2007 the shadow banking system had become so separated from commercial banking that the Federal Reserve didn’t know that a majority of credit was being generated by the shadow banks. When the crisis came, moreover, the Federal Reserve was not prepared with the right tools to deal with the problem. Ironically, one of the few tools that did work was, thanks to the repeal of Glass-Steagall, the ability to merge investment and commercial banks which was crucial in arranging acquisition of Bear Stearns by JP Morgan and of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America. Glass-Steagall Act was not even a good policy in dealing with the Great Depression. Eugene White [a professor of economics at Rutgers], for example, found that national banks with security affiliates were much less likely to fail than banks without affiliates. Randall Kroszner [a professor at University of Chicago and a former governor of the federal reserve system] and Raghuram Rajan [the governor of the Reserve Bank of India] found that securities issued by unified banks were (ex-post) of higher quality that those issued by investment banks. A powerful book by George Benston [who was a professor at Emory University] went through the entire Pecora hearings which supposedly revealed the problems with unified banking and found them to be a complete sham. Carlos Ramirez [a professor at George Mason University] showed that the separation of commercial and investment banking increased the cost of external finance. My own work unearthed the actual reasons for the separation in a titanic battle between the banking interests of the Morgans and Rockefellers, a real inside job. “Will these new rules prevent a future crisis? Of course not. No rules will prevent all manias, panics and crashes” “Nothing has been done!” may play well in some quarters but the Obama administration has in fact imposed systematic reform on the financial system. Most importantly, capital requirements have been increased (leverage has been reduced), forcing financial intermediaries to have greater skin in the game and to provide a cushion in the event of a fall in asset prices. Moreover, capital requirements have been extended far into the shadow banking system. Most recently, the Fed has imposed a capital surcharge on the biggest institutions i.e. the too big to fail institutions. As Fed Chair Janet Yellen said at the time the capital surcharge on the big players "will confront these firms with a choice: they must either hold substantially more capital, reducing the likelihood that they will fail, or else they must shrink their systemic footprint, reducing the harm that their failure would do to our financial system. Either outcome would enhance financial stability." Ironically, despite the political power of the financial sector it seems that more has been done to raise bank capital ratios than to require homeowners to raise their capital ratios by requiring larger down payments. There is a lesson there. Will these new rules prevent a future crisis? Of course not. No rules will prevent all manias, panics, and crashes but the new rules have reduced the likelihood of a large financial crisis and they have made smaller crises easier to manage. Since no rules will prevent all crises it’s important that the Federal Reserve and the Federal government have room to make credible commitments in the event of a future crisis and that means keeping public debt low. We need an unbalanced budget amendment, a requirement to pay down debt and even run surpluses in good times so that capacity is at the ready in bad times. The fact that we do not yet have our budget fully under control is perhaps the biggest danger moving forward. Lawrence White, professor of economics at New York University’s Stern School of Business The idea of reviving Glass-Steagall is receiving more attention because it seems like a "simple"—and simple to describe—action that would separate investment banking from commercial banking and thereby reduce the size of the largest banks in the U.S. Unfortunately, since the removal of the Glass-Steagall restrictions in 1999 had no connection to the financial crisis of 2008—all of the "bad actors" of the 2008 crisis could have done all of the same things even if Glass-Steagall had been in place—the whole notion of a revival of Glass-Steagall is misguided. A policy for curbing systemic risk would not involve a revival of Glass-Steagall, but does involve rigorous prudential regulation that has a number essential components: first, high capital requirements (relative to risks) for depositories and other financial institutions that have significant systemic connectivity with the overall financial system; substantial liquidity requirements for financial institutions that issue run-able short-term debt; activities limitations for prudentially regulated entities (limited to activities that are "examinable and supervisable"); managerial competency requirements for prudentially regulated entities; large numbers of well-trained and well-paid examiners and supervisors; and lastly, powers of receivership for the regulator.

These Retail Stores Are Open On Thanksgiving Day Watch Stocks In Vogue How Overtime Pay Ruling Affects Wal-Mart, Dollar Tree, Fast Food (Investor's Business Daily) Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) may be undergoing a turnaround, which is attracting investor attention. However, dividend-focused investors may now be shying away from the stock. According to Bloomberg Gadfly's Shelly Banjo, the aggregate amount of cash Wal-Mart distributed to investors in the form of dividends actually fell by 1.1 percent in the second quarter compared to a year ago. In fact, this marks only the third time in history this has happened, with the other two occurring in the first quarter of this year and the first quarter of 2014. Related Link: 4 Discount Retailers Reporting Earnings This Week Banjo noted that Wal-Mart is a member of the "dividend aristocrats" — companies that have boosted their dividend payments every year for at least 25 consecutive years. Long-term dividend-focused investors love a stock like Wal-Mart, as the company has actually increased its dividend for 43 straight years and is showing no signs of stopping. However, Banjo stated that Wal-Mart is merely doing "the bare minimum" to "cling to the aristocracy." She pointed out that Wal-Mart's dividend payout was raised by just one penny in each of the past three years, marking a change of policy after years of "steep" increases. Moreover, since Wal-Mart has also instituted a share buyback program, there are now 18 percent fewer shares on the market since 2010, which explains why the total payout to all investors has actually shrunk. On the other hand, Wal-Mart's dividend yield of around 2.7 percent is still superior to the S&P 500's average of 2.1 percent and looks even more attractive compared to the 10-year note yield of around 1.5 percent.

The stock fell by the daily limit of 20 percent for a second day, the biggest two-day tumble since 1999. The examination is underway, and Wal-Mart plans to hold additional conversations with the supplier, company spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said. If any issues are discovered, the retailer plans to “handle it appropriately,” she said. Wal-Mart is Welspun’s third-biggest customer, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Welspun supplies a number of products, including sheets, to Wal-Mart, McInnis said. Shares of Welspun fell to as low as 65.85 rupees in Mumbai trading yesterday. On Monday, the company said it is reviewing its supply chain and hiring a “Big Four” accounting firm to examine its processes. Target on Friday pulled the affected products off shelves and cut ties after it discovered sheets and pillowcases supplied by the textile manufacturer were mislabeled as Egyptian cotton. After Monday’s decline, the stock has a market capitalization of US$1.2 billion. Welspun Group said it wants to become one of India’s top 50 groups by market value by 2020, according to its Web site. “It is likely that other customers too will start raising questions over Welspun’s supplies,” said Arun Kejriwal, a director at Kejriwal Research & Investment Pvt in Mumbai. “The stock may have another rough day,” he said. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc, the Indian manufacturer’s biggest customer, and Wal-Mart also carry Welspun Egyptian cotton sheets. Both retailers sell the company’s 500 and 800-thread count sheets online, labeled as Crowning Touch. They retail for as much as US$175 a set. Welspun is engaging with key customers, Welspun managing director Rajesh Mandawewala said on a conference call on Monday. Welspun makes towels, sheets, rugs and carpets for 18 of the top 30 global retailers. Other major clients include J.C. Penney Co and Macy’s Inc. Every fifth towel sold in the US is manufactured by Welspun India, according to the company. Sales to Target amounted to US$90 million in the fiscal year that ended in March, or about 10 percent of the company’s revenue, the company said on Monday. Egyptian cotton, which has a longer fiber that creates a softer thread than other cotton, often carries a higher price because shoppers consider it to be of higher quality.

Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, plans to hold further discussions with Welspun and "handle it appropriately" if any issues are discovered, according to spokeswoman Marilee McInnis. The chain is also reviewing its other suppliers of Egyptian cotton products out of an abundance of caution, McInnis said. The announcement sent Welspun's shares down by daily limits for a second straight session. Wal-Mart is Welspun's third-largest customer, behind Target, which said late last week it had pulled sheets and pillowcases off its shelves after discovering they were mislabeled as Egyptian cotton. It also terminated all businesses with the supplier. A Welspun representative didn't immediately have a comment when reached by Bloomberg News. Part of a roughly $3 billion conglomerate headed by Balkrishan Goenka - with interests spanning textiles, steel, pipes, energy and infrastructure - Welspun said it manufactures every fifth towel sold in the U.S. and counts J.C. Penney Co. and Macy's Inc among its customers. "This is a serious issue," said S.P. Tulsian, who runs investment advisory firm SPTulsian.com. "On one hand the company has been talking of $2 billion top line by 2020 and on the other hand the U.S. is a very big market for them. Now that goal of $2 billion revenue will be difficult to meet." Welspun fell another 20 percent to 65.85 rupees on the Mumbai exchange Tuesday. The 36 percent two-day slide - the steepest since 1999 - cut the company's market value to 66.2 billion rupees ($990 million). Welspun Group said it wants to become one of India's top 50 groups by market value by 2020, according to its website. Sumant Kumar, an analyst at Elara Securities India Pvt., cut his rating on the stock to sell from buy. Goenka's family and group companies hold about 74 percent in the home-textiles supplier, with his wife Dipali Goenka acting as CEO and joint managing director. On Monday, a company connected to founder Goenka bought 500,000 Welspun shares in the open market, according to an exchange filing. Welspun said it's reviewing its supply chain and would hire a "Big Four" accounting firm to examine its processes. The company is engaging with key customers, managing director Rajesh Mandawewala said during a conference call Monday.

(Ann Millspaugh/Flickr/Creative Commons) In 1960, the city of Detroit was the greatest manufacturing city that the world had ever seen. Nearly 2 million people lived there, and it had the highest per capita income in the United States. That may be hard to believe because today it actually has one of the lowest per capita incomes of all of our major cities. Over the decades more than a million people have left the city, and thousands of abandoned homes have been torn down. But there are still tens of thousands of abandoned dwellings that remain standing, and some have sold for as little as $1 in recent years. Once, Detroit was the envy of the entire planet, but now it has become a global joke and in other countries they love to do news stories about "the ruins of Detroit" to show how rapidly America is rotting and decaying. Sadly, Detroit is far from alone because there are other formerly great manufacturing cities that have declined just as fast as Detroit has. Earlier today, I came across a video that contains footage that someone recently captured as they drove through the city of Detroit at night. To say that the footage is disturbing would be a tremendous understatement. It has become known as a mecca of violent crime and poverty, and now a viral video is giving an unpleasant view of Detroit after dark. The clip, called Driving through Detroit at night, was filmed by a woman who was a passenger in a car going around the Motor City and was posted to Twitter at the weekend. It shows terrifying scenes of gangs gathered on the sidewalk, prostitutes lifting up their skirts and dancing, and even a man being run over by a car on purpose. I would have liked to share the video with you all, but it is just way too graphic. There really are prostitutes lifting up their skirts in the video, and a man really is hit by a vehicle. If you want to watch it for yourself, it is very easy to find on YouTube. But please be warned that children should not be watching this. If you live in a peaceful rural or suburban setting, the kind of behavior displayed in this video may seem very foreign to you. In America today, it is way too easy to allow our televisions to define reality for us. But the warped view of reality that we get through our televisions is nothing like the real world. The real world is cold, cruel and very unforgiving. If you are in the wrong place at the wrong time, the real world will eat you alive. In the city of Detroit today, close to half the population is functionally illiterate, and one survey found that 60 percent of all children in the city are living in poverty. It has been reported that 40 percent of the street lights do not work, and as you can see from the video it is a very frightening place to be after dark. And don't count on the police to help you. The size of the police force in Detroit has been reduced by about 40 percent over the years, and it has been estimated that it takes the Detroit police an average of 58 minutes to respond to a call. If it was just one major city where all of these things were happening, that would be bad enough. Sadly, the truth is that what is happening in Detroit is happening all over the nation. In fact, St. Louis and Memphis now have higher gun crime rates than Detroit does. The listing places St Louis above the notoriously dangerous Detroit which has topped the list in previous years thanks to the city's high gun crime rate. Detroit is now listed as third after Memphis, Tennessee, which had 84.2 violent crimes per 10,000 residents. Birmingham, Alabama, comes in fourth place with 82.8 violent crimes per 10,000 residents while Rockford, Illinois, was fifth with a rate of 76.3. <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=1681737146" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=1681737146" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement Earlier this month, we saw how a major city such as Milwaukee can erupt in flames in just a matter of hours. And in Chicago, some of the major gangs have agreed to use automatic weapons and sniper fire in their battle against the police. A spirit of chaos and violence has descended on America, and things are going to get much worse during the months and years to come. Meanwhile, crime continues to rise in our smaller cities and in our suburbs as well. For a moment, I want you to consider a short excerpt from a recent Bloomberg article entitled "Walmart's Out-of-Control Crime Problem Is Driving Police Crazy." The call log on the store stretches 126 pages, documenting more than 5,000 trips over the past five years. Last year police were called to the store and three other Tulsa Walmarts just under 2,000 times. By comparison, they were called to the city's four Target stores about 300 times. Most of the calls to the northeast Supercenter were for shoplifting, but there's no shortage of more serious crimes, including five armed robberies so far this year, a murder suspect who killed himself with a gunshot to the head in the parking lot last year, and, in 2014, a group of men who got into a parking lot shootout that killed one and seriously injured two others. Police reports from dozens of stores suggest the number of petty crimes committed on Walmart properties nationwide this year will be in the hundreds of thousands. Did you catch that? This Bloomberg report says that there will be "hundreds of thousands" of crimes just committed at Wal-Mart stores alone this year. If people are behaving like this while times are still relatively stable and relatively good, what would things look like during a real crisis? Many people openly wonder what happened to Detroit, but it really isn't much of a mystery at all. Over the decades, our politicians have stood idly by as tens of thousands of businesses and millions of good paying jobs have left the country. Our economic infrastructure has been absolutely gutted, and as a result formerly great manufacturing cities have become rotting, decaying hellholes. And it certainly doesn't help that voters in many of these cities have willingly chosen to put radical leftists into power time after time. Unfortunately, it appears that the nation as a whole is about to hand the keys to the White House to a radical leftist that has a violent temper that is absolutely legendary. If she gets into power, that might just be the final nail in our coffin. What has already happened to Detroit is slowly happening to the entire country, but we never seem to learn from our past mistakes. So now we will suffer the consequences for our very foolish decisions, and it will not be pretty. Michael Snyder is the founder and publisher of End Of The American Dream.

Shares in Welspun, one of the world's largest textile manufacturers, were suspended after a few hours of trading, as on Monday, after dropping by 20 percent, their daily limit. Target said on Friday that it was severing ties with Welspun after its extensive investigation had confirmed that the Indian company, which purportedly used Egyptian cottons to make sheets and pillowcases sold to the retailer, substituted non-Egyptian cotton instead. Target is Welspun India's biggest customer after Bed Bath and Beyond. It accounted for about $90 million, or 10 percent of the company's total business in the financial year through March, Welspun executives said on a conference call on Monday. Welspun said on the call that it was investigating the product specification issue and would hire a Big Four accountancy firm to review its supply processes. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Welspun's third-biggest customer, is also reviewing the company's cotton certification records, the Wall Street Journal reported. A spokesman for Welspun said the company did not wish to comment on the reported Wal-Mart review. The U.S. retail giant accounts for about 8 to 9 percent of Welspun's revenues, according to Elara Capital analyst Sumant Kumar. "The risk is there as these are still early stages, so we need to wait and see," Kumar said. Sales of Egyptian cotton bedding account for only about 6 percent of Welspun's total sales, according to Kumar, but the loss to the company's credibility means other customers could withdraw all their business as Target has done. Analysts said Welspun did not provide clear answers during Monday's conference call, when asked whether other customers could follow Target's move to cut ties. "We are actively engaged with our clients," Welspun's Managing Director Rajesh Mandawewala said, in response to that query on the call. Kumar, in his note, said Welspun executives were vague on facts during the call, which threw up more questions than answers.

Can drones be taken seriously in the supply chain? Feature 23 August 2016 Before drones can be commercialised, we will need concrete legislation that outlines parameters of how they can be used COMMENT Drones have the potential to enhance process efficiency and reduce costs Nick Ismail Drones have the potential to revolutionise supply chain and logistics, a notion not lost on retail behemoths Amazon and Walmart, which have been trialling warehouse and home delivery projects for well over a year. More recently though, drone strategies have been taken to the next level, with Amazon announcing a partnership with the British government to run tests to explore the feasibility of using drones to deliver small parcels. The implications of this are significant, given that 90% of Amazon’s sales involve products weighing less than five pounds. In the US, 7-Eleven have even made their first commercial delivery by drone, demonstrating that drone deliveries are far more than just a pipe dream. >See also: Will drones be an opportunity or a threat to industry? From a technology perspective, the capabilities of drones are improving day by day – advancements in autonomous piloting, ‘sense and aware’ technologies and increased battery life mean that delivery drones are now very much a potential for the future. For users, it is expected that drones will reduce costs and speed up traditional supply chains, deliver an additional source of data gathering and provide added convenience because they are not restricted to postcodes. However, a lot of preparation is still needed before drone delivery in everyday supply chains becomes feasible. . Only once an enabling policy framework is in place can the drone market fully develop. >See also: The future of retail: digital, drones, decisions, data – and no queuing The UK is slightly ahead in legislative terms, as certain guidelines around the use of drones already exist. The Civil Aviation Authority’s ‘The Drone Code’ requires drones to be flown in direct visual line of sight of the pilot; away from congested areas, aircrafts and airports; at least 50m from people, vehicles and structures; and under 400ft. These stipulations are accompanied by other barriers, such as 20kg weight limits. As drones can only travel short distances and with light loads, they are currently only suited to delivering smaller packages to a consumer customer base. Therefore, it is likely to be some time before the technology is able to sustain the volume and consistency of B2B services, as work will need to be done to increase load lifting capacity and journey endurance. >See also: They’re watching you: drone technology to establish evolved geographical information systems Furthermore, cybersecurity fears are among the biggest obstacles, given that drones require a wireless connection to an operations centre, making them potentially vulnerable to hackers. There are also concerns over whether drones will be used to complement existing jobs in the supply chain or replace them outright. Despite some stumbling blocks, the market is projected to reach $5.59 billion by 2020. To make these expectations a reality, it is likely the government will call for companies to register to operate drones and that organisations will need to prove they have a strategy in place that complies with legislation. As drones show promise to be the next disruptive technology within the supply chain, businesses, would do well to start investigating strategies now to see if they would fit their business model. >See also: How to solve the danger of the drone Whether to speed up retail deliveries or bring key parts and equipment to heavy industry projects, drones have the potential to enhance process efficiency and reduce costs. Businesses should start seeking help from experts to understand the technological challenges, practicalities and limitations of using drones as part of the supply chain process before dismissing altogether or indeed going all in too quickly.   Sourced by Trish Young, UK head of business consulting – retail, consumer goods, travel & hospitality, Cognizant Related Topics drones Comments (0) Leave a Reply Cancel replyLogin to comment Prev Next Read More Latest Popular Two-thirds of London’s councils suffered a data breach in the last 4 years 8 ways Philip Hammond put technology at the centre of his first Autumn Statement Looking ahead to 2020 and the e-voting system Connecting big data and big content Customer service must go mobile in the Uber era The smart nation: Singapore’s masterplan The path to manageable data Wine cellar, swimming pool and a treehouse: Inside Zoopla’s new office Rolling into the digital age: inside Rolls-Royce’s tech transformation Turning big data into high-class insights Products Information Age Magazine Since its launch in 1995, Information Age has been regarded as one of the most respected technology titles in the B2B realm.

(TGT) terminated business with the Indian textile manufacturer over cheaper bedsheets and pillowcases being labeled as premium Egyptian cotton. Following this, retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) is reviewing supplier Welspun's cotton certification records, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Welspun India, part of conglomerate Welspun Group, told BSE in a filing that it has initiated a probe in the matter. 'We have initiated actions to investigate the root cause. We are appointing an external auditor to audit our supply systems and processes. This is an issue of highest priority for us and we will take all necessary steps to address it.' Target on Friday announced that it was ending all business with Welspun India after it discovered last month that 750,000 sheets and pillowcases labeled as Egyptian cotton were actually made with another type of cotton. The retailer pulled the items from its stores. The company began to notify customers on Friday about a refund on the products. These were produced between August 2014 and July 2016 and sold for as much as $75. Target confirmed that the withdrawal includes two lines of Egyptian cotton bedding, and not all of its Egyptian cotton sheets are affected. Mumbai-based Welspun makes towels, sheets, rugs and carpets for 18 of the top 30 global retailers. Target is Welspun's second-biggest customer, behind Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., and Wal-Mart is the third-biggest customer. Other major clients include J.C. Penney Co. and Macy's Inc. Welspun also manufactures towels for the Wimbledon tennis championships and the Rugby World Cup. As per reports, every fifth towel sold in the US is manufactured by Welspun India, and its sales to Target amounted to $90 million in the fiscal year ended in March.

Sanjai Welspun shares fell to as low as Rs65.85 in Mumbai trading on Tuesday. Mumbai: Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world’s largest retailer, said on Tuesday it is reviewing Welspun India Ltd’s cotton certification records following Target Corp.’s decision to snap ties with the Indian textile maker. Welspun stock plunged 20% for a second successive day to close at Rs.65.85 at Tuesday’s close, the lowest in 15 years, the two-day rout wiping Rs.3,717.48 crore off its market value. American retailer Target, Welspun’s second largest customer, said it is cutting business ties with the textile firm, which it accused of passing off cheap cotton bed sheets as those made of fine Egyptian cotton between August 2014 and July 2016. “Yes, Welspun is a current supplier and supplies us with a number of products, including some sheets. We are currently reviewing Welspun cotton certification records and plan to have additional conversations with Welspun. If we discover an issue, we will handle it appropriately,” a Wal-Mart spokesperson said in an email response to Mint. Click here for enlarge Wal-Mart is Welspun’s third biggest customer, behind Target and Bed Bath and Beyond Inc., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Welspun currently supplies a number of products, including bed sheets, to the retailer. The company makes towels, sheets, rugs and carpets for 18 of the top 30 global retailers. Its other major clients include J.C. Penney Co. and Macy’s Inc. It also manufactures towels for the Wimbledon tennis championships and the Rugby World Cup. “Sales from the US account for two-thirds of Welspun’s sales. If the other companies also start investigating the quality of supplies from Welspun and find issues with it, then could be a cascading impact on revenues,” said Sumant Kumar, an analyst at Elara Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd. Welspun has appointed an external auditor (one of the big four) to audit its supply systems and processes. “This is an issue of highest priority to us and we will take necessary steps to address it,” Welspun said in a statement to BSE. Rajesh R. Mandawewala, managing director at Welspun India, told analysts on Monday that the company had been selling the same material to a “few other customers” as well. “We are actively engaged with our customers. Most of them have been supportive,” he said, sharing that the product made up 3-6% of its overall sales. Mandewewala said the firm was in talks with audit firms to restore the robustness of its supply process and the audit should be completed in 6-8 weeks. Sapna AgarwalP.R.

By Thomas Bailey Jr. of The Commercial Appeal Posted: Dec. 25, 2015 2 A Memphis plant last month put a wrap on its 2015 printing of more than 10 million rolls of Christmas gift wrapping for Wal-Mart. The increased production by Impact Innovations' plant at 6269 Shelby Drive is part of Wal-Mart's effort to stock more of its shelves with U.S.-made products. "In 2015, 100 percent of the giftwrap printed in Impact Innovations' Memphis facility was for Wal-Mart,'' Wal-Mart spokesman Scott Markley said. That production represents about a third of the gift wrap Minnesota-based Impact Innovations sold to Walmart 2015. Impact Innovations also supplies Wal-Mart wrapping paper that is printed in China and converted into consumer-size rolls. But in 2016 half of all the wrap that Impact Innovations sells to Wal-Mart will be printed in Memphis. "And that's in addition to all the wrap we produce for other customers,'' said Impact Innovations chief executive officer John Dammermann. His company's other customers include Kmart, Michael's and Big Lots. The Memphis employer is playing a role in Walmart's 10-year commitment — started in 2013 — to buy $250 billion in products "supporting American jobs.'' "Up until 2015, 100 percent of our wrap was printed in China,'' Dammermann said. Before the Wal-Mart contract, Impact Innovations in Memphis would receive master rolls of wrapping paper, each containing 40,000 linear feet, that were printed in China. The Memphis plant used machinery to convert the master rolls into small, consumer-size rolls sold in stores. "Now, we are actually printing the paper,'' said Trisha White, senior director of marketing for Impact Innovations. "Next year, we hope to start printing the first of January,'' she said. Wal-Mart's plan has worked so far, at least in Memphis. Impact Innovations had about 35 full-time employees before the Wal-Mart contract, added 18 in 2015, and plans to hire more the next two years. In addition, the company hired more than 100 seasonal workers this year. Impact Innovations bought a new press in May to accommodate the big Wal-Mart contract and had it running a month later. In June the plant started printing the Wal-Mart wrap branded Holiday Time and stamped "Made in the USA" for distribution to the chain's 4,500 stores. "Our customers tell us that where products are made is most important second only to price,'' Markley said. "With changes in energy costs and labor costs overseas, it is increasingly cost-effective and efficient to manufacture closest to the point of consumption ...,'' he said. Impact Innovations is a Minnesota-based company with a 250,000-square-foot plant the Southridge industrial park of Southeast Memphis. The company had been a competitor of Memphis's old Cleo Inc. gift-wrap company until 2011 when Impact Innovations purchased Cleo's designs, licenses and other intellectual property. Cleo's owner, CSS Industries, closed the Cleo plant at 4025 Viscount in December 2011. In March, the Economic Development Growth Engine (EDGE) board granted Impact Innovations a three-year tax incentive totaling $297,000. In turn, the company decided to stay in Memphis instead of moving to DeSoto County, buy two additional printing presses worth more than $7 million and add 18 full-time employees to the 35 it already employed. Without identifying Walmart at the time, Impact Innovations told the EDGE board it had signed an agreement with its largest customer to produce more wrapping paper.
