Sauter March 17, 2017 6:00 am EDT Print Email Tweet Most state economies are relatively diverse, yet it is not uncommon for a single industry to have an outsized impact on the state’s economy and labor market. In some cases, a single company employs a significant share of the state’s workforce. State governments tend to be the largest employers in each state. There are more than 22 million public employees nationwide. In contrast, Wal-Mart — by far the nation’s largest private employer — employs about 1.5 million full-time workers in the United States. When excluding public administrative bodies, Wal-Mart is often the largest employer in a state, but a number of other organizations also emerge as the biggest employer on the state level. The size of these companies varies considerably. In Alaska, the Providence Health & Services network of hospitals employs around 4,000 people. In Washington state, Boeing employs 18 times as many people. In Texas, Wal-Mart employs 171,531, at last count. Based on the most recent available full and part-time employee counts, these are the largest employers in each of the 50 states. Click here to see the Largest Employer in Every State. As the world’s largest retailer, Wal-Mart has a uniquely large impact on many state economies, and it is the largest employer in 23 states. The 53,310 people employed in Arkansas — the retailer’s home state — accounts for about 30% of the state’s entire retail sector, and about 4% of the state’s total workforce. Educational and medical institutions also frequently top a state’s list of employers. After Wal-Mart, one of the more common largest employer across the 50 states is a state’s university system. The State University of New York, which operates 64 campuses across the state, employs over 90,000 faculty and staff. Similarly, organizations operating in the health care sector and have multiple large campuses across the state are often major employers as well. In 14 states, a health care network is the largest employer, including Partners HealthCare in Massachusetts, which employs 68,000 people. Several of these health care networks are also part of a university system, such as the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, which employs 61,000 people in the state. To determine the largest employer in each state, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed employment figures for nonprofits and private and publicly held companies from company press releases, government data, business journals, local media reports, as well as statements from company representatives. For the purposes of our analysis, we treated some state government employers like public universities as independent organizations, in keeping with how states frequently identify and compare company headcounts. Military bases were excluded from the list. In many cases, employee counts for the various colleges, laboratories, and medical centers falling under a single university system were combined. This was because these systems frequently attribute employees from the university and medical centers together. However, when a spokesperson from the medical centers or universities identified the organizations as distinct employers, they were counted separately. This are the largest employer in every state.

Flathead Beacon REFRESHING WEATHER CONDITIONS WILL UPDATE SHORTLY... FOLLOW Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn YouTube Tumblr RSS Feed SECTIONS News & Features Sports Outdoors Arts & Entertainment Opinion Photos Events Marketplace Prev Let’s Not Repeat Main Street Mistakes Kalispell’s downtown parking is again being heavily used By Fran Tabor // Mar 19, 2017 // Letter, Opinion Share Share Tweet Print Email This winter’s heavy snow reminded me of those bad old days driving down Kalispell’s Main Street before we so wisely spent money to widen it. Back in the ‘80s all traffic came to a stop if someone wanted to back out of his or her parking spot. Unless, of course, traffic didn’t stop, in which case if you were the person trying to leave, you were stuck! I am thankful today such traffic-choking is temporary. Our improved, widened street makes driving and parking downtown easier and safer. There are plans to undue our wonderful Main Street widening, turn it back into only one-lane driving, with a center turn lane. Worse, these same “planners” think diagonal parking should replace our current parallel parking. With parallel parking all of us, even in the smallest cars, can easily see when it is safe to pull out. With the proposed three-lane and diagonal parking, if you are driving down Main Street and realize too late someone is trying to exit a diagonal parking spot, you have no choice but to turn into the center turn lane – an illegal maneuver, the center lane is for turning only! Why repeat yesterday’s mistakes? “People refuse to walk to businesses so we must have more parking on Main Street.” Has no one seen the Wal-Mart parking lot? Even the closest handicapped parking is across a wide, two-lane driving “street” away from Wal-Mart’s front door. Some of Wal-Mart’s parking spots are the equivalent of over three blocks away. On busy days even those distant spots are filled. People are willing to walk because there is something to walk to. After years of stagnation, Kalispell’s downtown parking is again being heavily used. This is good! We are discovering Kalispell’s interesting variety of small shops. Like Wal-Mart shoppers, we have a reason to walk. Kalispell is part of the national trend of increased downtown business successes. Whenever streets are torn up, shopping on those streets takes a dive. Street construction nationwide has forced many businesses into bankruptcy. A few years ago, Kalispell widened the sidewalks on First Avenues East and West. Shops endured months of reduced income. Several went from profitable to out of business. Their empty storefronts made neighboring buildings less valuable. Let’s spend on money on the streets with big potholes, on the many blocks with no sidewalks, on the new streets, street lights, landscaping, public sitting, public signage, and other expenses in the old train track area. Let’s not waste one penny resurrecting yesterday’s Main Street mistakes.

Target is a dividend champion, which has paid dividends since 1965 and raised them every year for 49 years in a row. The most recent dividend increase was in June 2016, when the Board of Directors approved a 7.10% increase in the quarterly dividend to 60 cents per share. The company’s largest competitors include Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) and Amazon.con, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Over the past decade this dividend growth stock has delivered an annualized total return of 1.60% to its shareholders. Future returns will be dependent on growth in earnings and dividend yields obtained by shareholders. More recently, the stock price has been hammered by a decline in earnings expectations. This is why I wanted to take another look at Target. The company has managed to deliver a 3.60% average increase in annual EPS over the past decade. Target is expected to earn $4.01 per share in 2018 and $5.80 per share in 2019. In comparison, the company earned $4.09 per share for fiscal year 2017. Between 2005 and 2016, the number of shares outstanding has decreased from 912 million to 582.5 million. The decrease in shares outstanding through consistent share buybacks adds an extra growth kick to earnings per share over time. I do not like the fact that the net income between 2007 and 2017 decreased from $2.787 billion to $2.669 billion. Target focuses on affluent consumers with its upscale stores. Its customer base is somewhat different than that of competitor Wal-Mart. Many of Target’s customers enjoy shopping there, and are attracted by the appeal of offerings and overall atmosphere within the stores. Target’s stores are generally more appealing than those of Wal-Mart, and are cleaner. In addition, Target manages to retain shoppers with its RedCard. Shoppers who use the Target Card get a discount, but also tend to spend more than the average purchaser. In addition, the company has been able to drive more traffic with sales of grocery/food items. 7 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are Actually Safe What is the competitive advantage of Target? I believe that the company offers a unique shopping experience that competitors like Wal-Mart do not offer. I also believe that Target looks for a certain type of consumer, who does not like the assortment of goods and the experience that Wal-Mart provides, yet still wants to get a bargain. The company has been able to offer fashion chic items, which draw the specific type of shopper they target. The company also offers convenient locations for shoppers, who come to Target for its quality merchandise. I believe that shares could deliver a very good return to investors who are willing to weather near-term turbulence at the company. Growth for Target could be driven by expansion of number of stores in the US, growth in same-store sales, as well as expanding online sales. The company is targeting cost cuts, in order to boost margins. I am more interested in increasing the number of stores, in order to increase penetration in the US. Relative to the number of Wal-Mart stores in the US, I still believe there could be areas of new store development for Target, as long as this is executed in a smart way of course. Unfortunately, the number of stores has gone nowhere since 2010. Despite the issues that Target experienced with its Canadian expansion in 2013-2015, I think that the company may have an opportunity to expand internationally. This is a driver which could propel earnings per share forward for the next 20 years. It has to be executed better than the Canadian store fiasco however. Another driver for future growth could be the CityTarget stores, which are smaller, but provide the option to locate in densely populated areas. Those stores could have better productivity due to higher potential traffic and higher inventory turnover because of that.

KABC By ABC7.com staff Saturday, March 18, 2017 02:46PM VERNON, Calif. -- A Vernon company is issuing a recall of 21,000 pounds of frozen pizza sold at Walmart stores because of possible Listeria contamination. The 16-inch pizza made by RBR Meat Co. is sold as "Marketside Extra Large Supreme Pizza" with lot code 20547. Routine testing by the company revealed the presence of Listeria monocytogenes in pizza produced on Feb. 23, 2017, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. About 1,600 people are infected with listeriosis every year and of those 260 die, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal issues. The most vulnerable are pregnant women, newborns, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. The company said there have been no confirmed reports of illness. The pizza is sold at Walmart stores throughout the West Coast. Anyone who purchased the product is urged to throw it away or return it to the place of purchase. More information about the recall is available from the USDA here.

ModCloth’s is a women’s retailer known for celebrating size diversity. It is not uncommon to see ad campaigns for the clothing company featuring models of all sizes side by side. In 2015, the company announced on their style blog that they were officially retiring their plus size section stating, “we could all agree that shopping categories should be defined by types of clothing, not types of bodies.” For super cute swimsuits, shop @ModCloth and save 10% with your college discount! https://t.co/g5RsCPmspQ pic.twitter.com/AOAImqXkec — UNiDAYS US (@UNiDAYS_US) February 10, 2016 Through embracing body-positive practices, ModCloth quickly became a favorite of the curvy girl fashion movement that plus size millennials embraced on Instagram and Pinterest.

However, the company has been slowing purchasing smaller niche e-commerce brands such as footwear and accessories site ShoeBuy as part of an overall aggressive strategy to cut into Amazon’s stranglehold on retail. The Shoebuy purchase was made to compete with Amazon’s Zappos brand. Going somewhere? https://t.co/4MqSySx7bD pic.twitter.com/FjLwqxqXFp — ShoeBuy (@shoebuy) June 15, 2016 Walmart’s ModCloth buy goes after one of Amazon’s major weaknesses, which is a unique women’s apparel brand that appeals to a younger demographic. With featured companies such as Halston Heritage, Lacoste, and Calvin Klein, Amazon’s current catalog of women’s fashion tends to skew older and affluent. Walmart’s market strength has always been in providing inexpensive brands for people outside of metropolitan regions. The ModCloth buy broadens the reach of Walmart’s existing customer base. [Image by Gunnar Rathbun/AP Images] The sale of ModCloth comes at a time when the company is coming off of a widely-publicized downturn that had investors worried about its long-term prospects. Featured frequently on NBC’s The Today Show, ModCloth built its brand on the retro revivalism favored by celebrities such as Zooey Deschanel and Taylor Swift in the early years of her career. Founded in 2002, the Pittsburgh-based company was the brainchild of Susan Gregg Koger and Eric Koger. The pair, now based in Los Angeles, nurtured a company they started as Carnegie Mellon Students into what was thought to be a global success story with over $150 million in sales in 2014. However, there were signs that the company was struggling.

According to Bloomberg, Kaness put into place sales initiatives to double ModCloth’s earnings potential. However, the company failed to meet those ambitious sales goals, and cracks began to appear in the once promising retailer’s veneer. Though the company had decent earnings, there were several setbacks which ultimately led to the Walmart deal. As TechCrunch reported, ModCloth laid off nearly 15 percent of its employees in 2014. The company has also had to deal with a changing aesthetic in millennial fashion, which is embracing a different kind of retro with the nineties inspired pastels and grunge apparel. 90's fashion that is trendy right now on the blog. https://t.co/42hJZoxGOc pic.twitter.com/15rMW2tVRS — Mode By Cece (@ModebyCeCe) March 3, 2017 ModCloth’s vintage-style aesthetic may not provide the most trendy clothing in the marketplace; however, they remain a staple for many young women due to their innovative advertising strategy which incorporates real-life customers into its marketing. For instance, ModCloth’s website features a modern style gallery where consumers can upload pictures of their outfits.

For many, news that the body-positive ModCloth would be joining Jet.Com is a sign that the indie clothing line has sold out by embracing a corporate brand. Indeed, as news spread of the sale, ModCloth’s loyal customers began expressing their displeasure online.

(@kiersi) March 18, 2017 As an online backlash builds against both ModCloth and Walmart, it remains to be seen if there will be any impact on sales. To get ahead of a potential boycott, ModCloth co-founder Susan Gregg Koger released a statement reaffirming that the clothing company would retain their current website in addition to appearing on Jet.com.

We have about $285,000 in stocks plus a $122,000 annuity we just bought from our stockbroker. We hope to retire in 10 years and then work just part time. Now we are looking for income and growth. We own 146 shares of Costco, which we bought at $43 in 2005, and have reinvested all the dividends — which have increased each year, so each year, I get more shares. We do this with all our stocks, which is what you recommended to us years ago. Unfortunately, Costco yields only 1 percent. Because we’re now looking for more income, our broker wants us to sell Costco (I have a large tax-loss carryforward in two other stocks our broker sold us) and buy Wal-Mart because it yields 2.9 percent. Wal-Mart also has a good record of dividend and profit growth. This would triple our income, and we would stay in the same investment sector, which makes good sense to us. My wife and I would appreciate your opinion and good advice. — L.L., Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Dear L.L.: Jumpin’ Jehoshaphat, that stockbroker has cracker crumbs on his brain and is dangerous to your wealth. If his annuity recommendation is as bad as his stock recommendation, then you folks are in big trouble. Fire this cad before he gives you any more stinking advice. As certain as the sun will shine somewhere in the world today, that sleazeball has given you the worst possible stock advice. I strongly recommend that you get your account reviewed by a knowledgeable, wise and experienced professional whom you can trust. There are some highly qualified brokers in your area, so I suggest that you ask your accountant or one of the lawyers you work with for a couple of names. And after your interviews, if you come back to me with their recommendations, I will help you select the right professional to help you and your spouse meet your retirement goals. Meanwhile, don’t you dare sell Costco. Costco (COST-$164), with 505 wholesale membership warehouses in the U.S. — plus 91 in Canada, 36 in Mexico, 28 in the United Kingdom, 12 in South Korea, 12 in Taiwan and eight in Australia — is one of the finest mega-retailers in the world. Because less than 25 percent of its merchandise is imported, COST is well-insulated from potential changes in the tax code, if Congress has the guts to follow through with trade tariffs. (Some 68 percent of Wal-Mart’s merchandise is imported.) Membership trends continue to be solid. The 89 percent renewal rate is the best in the industry, and based on the successes of prior increases, I suspect that management will hike its membership fee later this year. It takes about seven or eight quarters for such a fee hike to be fully felt on the income statement, and a small hike would add importantly to COST’s bottom line. Based on past performance, I’d prefer being an owner of COST over being an owner of Wal-Mart (WMT-$71) stock, which has basically acted like flotsam and jetsam for the past dozen years. COST’s net profit margins of 4 percent are 35 percent higher than WMT’s 2.7 percent, and certainly COST’s sweet stock performance — a fourfold increase in the past dozen years — must be the envy of the WMT boys in Bentonville. The companies sell similar products, but Wall Street believes that COST does it better. And indeed it does. COST’s 218,000 employees generated $120 billion in revenues last year, creating $2.6 billion in net income, which translates to $18,000 net profit per employee. Meanwhile, WMT’s 2.3 million employees put $500 billion in revenues on the books last year, producing $13.5 billion in net income, or $6,000 net profit per employee. So COST’s employees take home bigger paychecks and better retirement benefits than all those at WMT. Argus Research, Thomson Reuters, Market Edge and Merrill Lynch have “hold” recommendations on WMT and “buy” recommendations on COST. Malcolm Berko addresses questions about stocks. Reach him at P.O.

The company declined to specify the price on the deal that closed Friday, saying only that it was in the same range as its previous two purchases of online businesses. Those were $51 million and $70 million. Wal-Mart is working hard to attract younger and more affluent shoppers, but winning over ModCloth's devoted customers, fans of its vintage-inspired patterned dresses, inclusive sizing and community feel, may be a challenge. Many expressed their disappointment on social media when they heard talk of a deal with Wal-Mart. Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart said ModCloth will continue to operate as a stand-alone and complementary brand to its other e-commerce sites, and will bring experience and talent to strengthening the company's fashion business aimed at millennials. Independent designers who sell on ModCloth's site, it said, will gain the opportunity to expand their reach. ModCloth CEO Matthew Kaness, his executive team and the company's 300-plus employees will stay based in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Pittsburgh, and will join Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce retail organization. Wal-Mart spent more than $3 billion for upstart Jet.com last year and since then has purchased other smaller companies, including online footwear retailer ShoeBuy.com and the outdoor gear seller Moosejaw. Marc Lore, the founder of Jet.com who is now CEO of Walmart.com, said last month that the company was still looking for new startups to buy.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars COMMERCE Walmart could soon use drones to deliver purchases Jonathan Vanian, Fortune@JonathanVanian March 17, 2017 7:30 PM Tags: drone, drone delivery, patent, Walmart, Walmart News Walmart may use drones like in-store messenger pigeons. The retail giant was granted a patent this week for a system in which drones would shuttle products between different departments inside its stores. The idea is to free customers from having to walk across its super-sized emporiums to find what they want and from having to wait while employees return from far-away storerooms. Ultimately, Walmart believes that drones “can greatly improve the customer experience without overburdening the human associates of the facility.” Waiting, the filing said, “can contribute to reduced customer satisfaction.” The drones would mostly avoid buzzing above customers’ heads by being routed over shelves instead of store aisles, according to the patent filing. But the filing did leave the door open to humans and flying delivery assistants crossing paths. Although flying drones over people’s heads may not be a safety risk, steering clear of customers may “nevertheless provide an increased feeling of security for those below,” the filing said. Of course, Walmart’s new patent is no guarantee that it will use drones. Companies file patents all the time, and not every one of them is put into use. Fortune contacted Walmart for more information and will update this story if it responds. As part of the drone delivery system, each store would have a computer system that would function as automated air traffic control for dispatching drones and deciding their flight paths. Sensors on the drones would help them avoid obstacles. Several drone landing zones would be created in stores, some of which would be in plain sight of customers while others may be hidden from view. Drones may uses nets or hooks to grab and carry items, depending on the product’s shape and weight. If needed, employees would attach items to drones after getting specific instructions through text messages or through an app. Above: Walmart drone delivery patent Image Credit: Fortune Walmart’s proposed drone delivery system is different from other high-profile drone delivery projects by the likes of Amazon, Google parent company Alphabet, and UPS. Those initiatives involve drones delivering goods to people’s homes, but drone experts generally say that such delivery systems are years away because of factors like federal regulations, limited drone battery life, and the high cost of larger drones that are capable of traveling long distances. A recent Gartner report said that businesses could start using drones to deliver goods within their own facilities, something akin to what Walmart is proposing. Additionally, a business that operates in a large office park could use drones to distribute packages like pneumatic tube systems used years ago for inter-office mail, Gartner analyst Gerald Van Hoy told Fortune in February.

The company declined to specify the price on the deal that closed Friday, saying only that it was in the same range as its previous two purchases of online businesses. Those were $51 million and $70 million. Wal-Mart is working hard to attract younger and more affluent shoppers, but winning over ModCloth’s devoted customers, fans of its vintage-inspired patterned dresses, inclusive sizing and community feel, may be a challenge. Many expressed their disappointment on social media when they heard talk of a deal with Wal-Mart. Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart said ModCloth will continue to operate as a stand-alone and complementary brand to its other e-commerce sites, and will bring experience and talent to strengthening the company’s fashion business aimed at millennials. Independent designers who sell on ModCloth’s site, it said, will gain the opportunity to expand their reach.

RBR Meat Company Inc. issued the recall for its Marketside Extra Large Supreme Pizza after possible listeria was discovered during routine sampling. The product was available for purchase in Walmart store locations across California, Colorado, Nevada, Washington state, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming, Alaska and Hawaii. According to a news release on the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) the products were produced on Feb. 23 and are packaged in a 50.6-ounce corrugated box containing one shrink-wrapped 16-inch pizza with lot code 20547. According to FSIS, no illnesses tied to the recall had been reported as of March 15. However, consumers who have the product in their freezer or who have purchased it are urged to discard of it or return it for a refund. The recall comes amid a deadly listeria outbreak linked to a New York-based creamery that has resulted in at least six illnesses and two fatalities. Consuming foods contaminated with listeria could cause fever, muscle aches, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, convulsions, diarrhea or other stomach issues. Pregnant women who are exposed to listeria may suffer miscarriage, stillbirths or premature delivery. Those with compromised immune systems are also considered at an increased risk of health complications after exposure. Consumers with additional questions may contact FSIS at AskKaren.gov or 1-888-674-6854. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on Fox News.

After a holiday season where Nintendo consoles — namely the NES Classic Edition and 3DS — were nearly impossible to find, the Switch followed suit, with only a small selection of walk-in consoles available at retailers for those who hadn’t pre-ordered the system. More: Nintendo Switch: Our first take If you are looking to get a Switch as soon as possible, we currently advise you to sign up for the GameStop, Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart email lists, and periodically circle back to Target and Toys R Us. Additionally, a page on Nintendo’s official website lists the major retailers offering the Switch. It’s a good idea to check back to see if more retailers are added. Even though the Switch is currently almost impossible to find, a recent interview with Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime in Wired may ease concerns. He claimed that Nintendo plans to ship 2 million units in the weeks surrounding launch, and that he believes the shipped units will meet demands. “Our focus is making sure that the consumer who wants to buy a Nintendo Switch can buy a Nintendo Switch,” he said. That said, Nintendo is reportedly doubling Switch production to help meet consumer demand, following strong early sales. Here’s how you can currently secure a Switch, so you can start playing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as soon as possible. If none of these options work for you, keep checking back, as we’ll be updating this post as more stores announce Switch availability. GameStop GameStop recently announced that it will have the Nintendo Switch back in stock on March 22, according to a report by GameSpot. The retailer advised customers to check with their local store regarding availability, and stated that customers will not be able to “reserve units in advance.” Purchases must be made in-person, and Gamestop will only carry “individual” units — implying that the retailer’s recent console bundles will not be available for purchase. Sign-up for Switch updates Best Buy Both the grey and neon versions of the Nintendo Switch are currently sold out on Best Buy’s website. To stay updated on availability, it’s a good idea to click “Notify Me When Available” on both the Switch with gray Joy-Con, and the Switch with neon red-blue Joy-Con. If you’re in the market for Switch accessories, however, a two-pack of gray, blue, and red Joy-Con controllers is currently available, as is an extra AC adapter, which can come in handy if you regularly use the system as a handheld. Charging docks and cases are also available. Switch Gray Switch Neon Target Target currently has the gray Joy-Con Switch available in limited amounts for in-store customers, and the neon red-blue version was available until about 1:30 p.m. EST on March 6. We would continue to monitor the retailer’s supply, as it appears to be updating more frequently than other retailers’ websites. The retailer also has limited in-store availability when it comes to extra Joy-Con controllers, cases, and the charging grip. The Pro controller, however, is only being sold in stores. Switch Gray Switch Neon Walmart The Nintendo Switch is currently sold out at Walmart, both online and in stores. Extra Joy-Con controllers, charging grips, and cases are available. Pro controllers, on the other hand, are a different story. At Walmart, customers can also sign up to receive in-stock alerts. You can sign up for notifications for both the Switch with gray Joy-Con, and the Switch with neon red-blue Joy-Con inventory pages. Switch Gray Switch Neon Amazon Amazon currently has only one product page displaying the Switch with gray Joy-Con. That said, you can be added to a product availability mailing list by signing into your Amazon account and clicking “Add to List” — where “Add to Cart” is normally located. Cases, Joy-Cons, and screen protectors are all available through Amazon, though the Pro controller can only be purchased from a third-party seller. Switch Gray Toys R Us Both versions of the Switch, as well as a $500 bundle, are currently sold out at Toys R Us. Extra Joy-Con controllers are currently available in select colors. This article was updated on March 17 by Will Nicol to info regarding GameStop’s recent Switch availability.

Erie Police were called to the store on East 28th and Elm Street shortly after 7 p.m. Employees and customers were told to evacuate the building. Some huddled under the overhang for an old bank drive-thru. A spokes person from Walmart told Erie News Now this was not a bomb threat. Instead, the manager of the store took what he described as a threatening call and called police. Officers checked out the building and found nothing. The investigation lasted 45 minutes, and the store was reopened.

President Michel Temer and his agriculture minister met with top diplomats of the European Union, Sweden, Canada and other countries to say slaughterhouses were being properly audited and that Brazilian meat is safe to eat. Temer said he was headed out for a steak afterward and encouraged others to do the same. Separately, China was said to have temporarily suspended beef imports from Brazil. Temer eats barbecue in a steak house in Brasilia on March 19. Photographer: Evaristo Sa/AFP via Getty Images “This is an urgent issue since it has repercussions for us internally and abroad,” Temer told reporters. “We spoke with embassies so that they could pass the word onto their governments in regards to any concern from the previous days. I invite everyone to go out to a Brazilian steakhouse now.” Temer then dined with 19 ambassadors at a 119 reais ($39) per person all-you-can-eat steakhouse, sitting between the Chinese and Angolan diplomats. Federal authorities said that an investigation unveiled Friday showed about 40 companies, including  JBS SA and BRF SA, had been involved in illicit activities such as bribing inspectors to approve the sale and export of spoiled meat and adding chemical substances to mask the poor quality. While the companies have denied the allegations, including through full-page ads in Brazil’s newspapers and spots on TV, their shares have tumbled at a time when both JBS and BRF are trying to access capital markets again. Explanations Sought The European Commission’s Health and Food Safety department is aware of the investigation and is seeking additional information, according to an emailed statement Sunday. The department said it hasn’t found any irregularities with health certificates related to meat from Brazil since 2015. China and the U.S. have also requested explanations, O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper reported, without saying how it obtained the information. China temporarily suspended imports from Brazil, according to people who received notice from the country’s quarantine authority. Goods currently at sea or at port will not be able to clear customs, according to one of the people. The China Meat Association is collecting information from individual companies about their purchases from Brazil and any potential losses they may have, Zhao Anli, an official at the group’s import and export sub-branch, said Monday. Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi said after the meeting Sunday that the issues unearthed by the investigations are not generalized or widespread in the industry, and that authorities are working to ensure the highest quality hygiene and transparency. “Brazil’s industry is robust and strong but it isn’t infallible,” he said. “We’re making sure that what’s being produced now is getting the proper inspection.” The presidency said in a statement that of more than 4,000 plants in the country only 21 are being probed, and that 33 of a total 11,000 employees in the industry are under investigation. Executive Arrested Federal police served hundreds of court orders related to the investigation on Friday, including more than 30 detention warrants, in what local media said was the largest police operation in the country’s history. Roney Nogueira dos Santos, a BRF executive, was arrested at Sao Paulo’s international airport on Saturday after arriving from South Africa. BRF said in an emailed statement that he surrendered to the authorities and is available to give all clarifications needed. China and Hong Kong, which together are the biggest export market for Brazilian meat, were the destination for about a third of the $5.5 billion of beef shipped from Latin America’s largest economy last year, according to the meat exporters group Abiec. The European Union is the second-largest market, with 13 percent of the exports. China and Hong Kong are also the biggest Brazilian market for chicken, while the European Union ranks third, according to the Brazilian Association of Animal Protein Abpa. Retail Chains Some of the tainted meat was sold domestically for school meals or to retail chains including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., according to police and Brazil’s Federal Revenue agency. Some was exported -- police allege three BRF cargoes tainted with salmonella are still en route to Europe. Wal-Mart said in a statement that it has requested explanations from the suppliers cited by the police, and that its internal procedures on food safety are reliable. The U.S. bought $297.8 million of red meat from Brazil in 2016, according to government data. That’s a fraction of the roughly $200 billion of meat Americans consume annually, the bulk of it from domestic sources, according to the North American Meat Institute. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up While prosecutors of the so-called “Weak Flesh” probe said the practice was widespread in the industry, there have been no cases of individuals getting sick from consuming the products, and Brazilians over the weekend were mostly buying meat as usual. It was alleged that some of the meat, including sausages and cold cuts, was adulterated with ingredients including pig heads, and that suspect smells were masked by applying acid. For more details on the police investigation, click here. Brazil’s Federal Inspection Service is one of the most efficient and rigorous worldwide, the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture said Saturday in a statement. On Friday, it said that while the scandal revealed only isolated cases, it may more broadly harm the country’s global trade reputation. Salmonella Strain The kind of salmonella found in containers of meat en route to Italy is Salmonella Saint Paul, which is permitted by European standards, BRF also said in a statement on Saturday. Prosecutors said that BRF and JBS had influence in choosing the inspectors responsible for overseeing their plants and paid bribes to get clearance for their products. Two executives at JBS and three at BRF are among those being investigated, police said. Expansion Plans Sao Paulo-based JBS said in a statement that it “vehemently repudiates” claims it sold spoiled food. While the company denied its executives were targeted by court orders, it confirmed three of its plants were included in Friday’s probe. The investigation and any potential repercussions on business come at a bad time for the companies. JBS is trying to sell shares in the U.S. and expand in what’s proving to be its most lucrative market, while BRF is pursuing a sale of shares in its halal unit -- a plan already in doubt after the company posted a record quarterly loss. JBS slumped 11 percent and BRF tumbled 7.3 percent at Friday’s close in Sao Paulo, the worst performers on Brazil’s benchmark stock index. Bond yields for both companies also surged.

(AP) — A battle pitting big-box retail giants including Menards and Wal-Mart against Wisconsin towns and cities is headed to the Legislature. Republican-backed proposals, written in conjunction with the League of Wisconsin Municipalities, are designed to close the so-called dark store loophole and increase how much the mega-retailers pay local communities in property taxes. The bills come in reaction to court rulings in Wisconsin and nearby Midwestern states — starting in Michigan — that have helped the retail giants lower the value placed on their stores for levying property taxes. The retailers have successfully challenged their tax assessments in communities across Wisconsin, and the Midwest, by arguing they are overtaxed and should pay the same rate as a store that is closed and vacant. That results in a shift of the property tax burden to smaller retail stores and property owners, said Jerry Deschane, executive director of the League of Municipalities. "We just think that's fundamentally unfair," he said. "The bottom line with the property tax is it has to be uniform." The cities will have to overcome opposition from the powerful state chamber of commerce and deep-pocketed retail giants that stand to lose millions from a change in current practice. Wisconsin Department of Revenue rules require that assessments be based on the fair market value of a property. The stores argue that the value of the underlying real estate should be determined by looking at comparable building sales, prices that usually fall far below the assessment of an operating store. Assessing the building as if it were empty has long been the standard in Wisconsin for determining its value, said Don Millis, a Madison attorney who has represented Target and other retailers in assessment challenges. Millis is also lobbying for the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce against changes to the law. "You value the sticks, bricks and mud," Millis said. Cities have been incorrectly assessing the property based on the potential lease value, he said. "We don't think they're being undervalued," he said. "We think assessors are being overly aggressive." But Republican state Sen. Duey Stroebel, who plans to introduce a bill next month addressing the issue, said the potential lease value of the property should be considered when valuing it for tax purposes. That is what the bill he and others are working on will do, he said. Millis warned that changing the law "could have long-term unintended consequences" affecting how all property is valued.

Big box stores including Menards, Lowe's and ShopKo have filed more than 20 lawsuits against Wisconsin municipalities in the past year challenging their property assessments. In one, Menards successfully argued last year that the value of its store in Fond du Lac assessed by the city at $9.2 million should be no more than $5.2 million. A similar lawsuit from Target argues that Fond du Lac should reduce its taxes on the retailer by about a third. The dilemma for small cities is that the cost of defending lawsuits can equal or exceed the amount of property tax revenue at play, so they are more inclined to settle than fight it, said Deschane, who's with the League of Municipalities. Lawmakers in nearby states have had mixed success in tackling the issue. A proposal in Michigan that attempted to require the taxable value to be based on the highest and best use of a property failed to pass last year. But in Indiana, the Republican-controlled Legislature, along with then-Gov. Mike Pence, enacted legislation to block what opponents call a tax loophole. The Wisconsin bill is modeled after the Indiana law. ___ Follow Scott Bauer on Twitter at https://twitter.com/sbauerAP . His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/scott-bauer .

A similar lawsuit from Target argues that Fond du Lac should reduce its taxes on the retailer by about a third. The dilemma for small cities is that the cost of defending lawsuits can equal or exceed the amount of property tax revenue at play, so they are more inclined to settle than fight it, said Deschane, who's with the League of Municipalities. Lawmakers in nearby states have had mixed success in tackling the issue. A proposal in Michigan that attempted to require the taxable value to be based on the highest and best use of a property failed to pass last year. But in Indiana, the Republican-controlled Legislature, along with then-Gov. Mike Pence, enacted legislation to block what opponents call a tax loophole. The Wisconsin bill is modeled after the Indiana law.

(NYSE: WMT) paid $3 billion for online retailer Jet.com last year, the acquired company had itself been in full acquisition mode. Since Wal-Mart’s acquisition, Jet.com has added two more retailers, ShoeBuy and outdoor apparel seller Moosejaw. News website Jezebel reported Wednesday afternoon that Jet.com, through Wal-Mart, has acquired women’s fashion retailer ModCloth for an unspecified sum. The deal is expected to close Thursday and an announcement is scheduled to be announced Friday. According to a report at Recode, the struggling retailer had been unable to raise additional capital and likely sold for around $80 million, roughly equal to the amount of venture capital ModCloth had raised since its founding in 2002. When Wal-Mart acquired Jet.com last August, the world’s largest retailer said that it would retain the Jet brand in order to “continue to provide a unique and differentiated customer experience with a curated assortment.” ModCloth fits right into that mold. ModCloth positions itself as a hip, quirky, independent retailer of “indie-inflected” clothes. The company might fit in with Jet.com or it might not. According to Jezebel, ModCloth CEO Matthew Kaness told employees: I think there’s a lot of overlap culturally with what [Wal-Mart’s] about and what we’re about. I think over time this is going to become an incredible marriage. Jezebel then noted, “In the recording we heard, employees in the room can be heard laughing in what sounds like disbelief.” The deal is part of an attempt by Wal-Mart to gain market share from e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), which has taken business from brick-and-mortar retailers. Wal-Mart shares were down fractionally in Thursday’s premarket session, after closing at $70.58, down about 0.2%, on Wednesday. The stock’s 52-week range is $62.72 to $75.19. The 12-month consensus price target is $74.37.

There are far better ways to shrink the federal budget deficit. By Gene Epstein Biography March 18, 2017 “Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don’t love it,” Donald Trump told The Wall Street Journal shortly before his inauguration, noting that the proposed border adjustment tax was “too complicated.” Trump isn’t always right when he makes off-the-cuff remarks such as that, but this time he was. The proposed border adjustment tax is so complicated that even its advocates can’t agree on how its disruptive effects on the U.S. economy will play out, and there’s nothing to love about that.

Marineci is heading to a remote area of Idaho this summer hoping to help a community in need. Small-town America relies on a program that attracts foreign physicians to underserved areas. A recent federal change, however, could delay newcomers. NYT Dr. Fadel Nammour, a gastroenterologist who recently became an American citizen and came to North Dakota from Lebanon 14 years ago, in an operating room at the Sanford Medical Center Fargo in Fargo, N.D., March 17, 2017. Small-town America relies on a program that attracts foreign physicians to underserved areas. A recent federal change, however, could delay newcomers. (Tim Gruber/The New York Times) By Miriam Jordan / The New York Times In Coudersport, Pa., a town an hour’s drive from the nearest Wal-Mart, Cole Memorial Hospital counts on two Jordanian physicians to keep its obstetrics unit open and is actively recruiting foreign specialists. In Fargo, N.D., a gastroenterologist from Lebanon — who is among thousands of foreign physicians in the state — has risen to become vice president of the North Dakota Medical Association. In Great Falls, Mont., 60 percent of the doctors who specialize in hospital care at Benefis Health System, which serves about 230,000 people in 15 counties, are foreign doctors on work visas. Small-town America relies on a steady flow of doctors from around the world to deliver babies, treat heart ailments and address its residents’ medical needs. But a recent, little-publicized decision by the government to alter the timetable for some visa applications is likely to delay the arrival of new foreign doctors, and is causing concern in the places that depend on them. While the Trump administration is fighting, in the courts of justice and public opinion, for its temporary travel ban affecting six countries, the slowdown in the rural doctor pipeline shows how even a small, relatively uncontroversial change can ripple through the country. In Montana, where nine counties do not have a single physician, it means Benefis Health does not know when a Romanian doctor trained in kidney transplants will arrive. The health care company spent months recruiting the doctor and had been expecting her in July. The doctor, Silviana Marineci, who is completing a fellowship at the University of Minnesota, said she was frazzled by being in limbo. “I won’t have an income, I don’t know if I will afford rent, I don’t know where I will be,” she said. “It’s insane.” The procedural change regards temporary visas for skilled workers, known as H-1B visas. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services recently announced it would temporarily suspend a “premium processing” option by which employers could pay an extra $1,225 to have H-1B applications approved in as little as two weeks, rather than several months. Companies using that option, the government said, have effectively delayed visas for others that did not pay the extra fee. A spokeswoman for the immigration agency, Arwen Consaul, said in a statement that the measure was necessary to “work down the existing backlogs due to the high volume of incoming petitions.” The H-1B program has raised questions about whether it displaces American workers, particularly in computer programming and engineering jobs, for which most of the visas are issued. H-1B recipients also include foreign physicians who practice in places shunned by American doctors for personal and professional reasons. About 25 percent of all physicians practicing or training in the United States are foreign, but in some inner cities and most rural areas, that share is significantly higher. There were 211,460 international medical graduates practicing in the United States in December 2015, according to the latest data available from the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates. Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.; Susan M. Collins, R-Maine; and Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., have urged the agency to continue premium processing. “Slowing down this successful two-decade-old program and the doctors it brings to rural areas will hurt families across North Dakota and rural America,” Ms. Heitkamp wrote in an email. It was a North Dakota senator, Kent Conrad, who in 1994 proposed to relieve a shortage of doctors by tapping foreign physicians who have completed medical education in the United States. His program waives the requirement that foreign doctors who graduate from residency programs in the United States return to their home countries for two years before working here. It lures such graduates to practice in underserved areas by offering them the chance to apply for a green card to live permanently in the United States after three years. The program must be reauthorized by Congress every two years. Ms. Klobuchar, who twice has introduced legislation to make the program permanent, plans to do so again in the coming weeks. Since the program’s inception, tens of thousands of foreign physicians have flocked to clinics and hospitals in Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta region, the Great Plains and elsewhere. Many of them, such as Dr. Fadel E. Nammour, vice president of the North Dakota Medical Association, put down roots and never leave. The friendliness that he found in Fargo reminded him of his home country, Dr. Nammour said. “We provide not only the care but also our leadership,” said Dr. Nammour, who is now a U.S. citizen. “The focus should be on making it easier to bring people in to cover the physician shortage we have.” Sign up for free newsletters and get more of the Post-Gazette delivered to your inbox Most Read Most Emailed Advertisement Most Commented Your e-mail: Your Name: Friends e-mail: Friends Name: Message: Captcha Submit Advertisement Create a free PG account.

(AP) — A Wal-Mart in the Phoenix area was evacuated over what turned out to be a fake bomb. Peoria police say a store employee reported the suspicious-looking device found in a stockroom about 10:20 a.m. Saturday. A bomb squad and robot were called in to check the item, which was made to look like an explosive with wires and flashing lights. It was removed and the store was combed to ensure safety. The scene was cleared in about four hours, and the store reopened. Police say the hoax device didn't pose a danger but it caused fear and concern and authorities will be checking surveillance video as part of their investigation. No suspect has been identified. Wal-Mart issued a statement saying it takes "the safety and security of our customers and associates seriously at all times" and is helping the police with the investigation.

Ross was referencing Snoop Dogg’s music video for “Lavender,” which features a scene in which a gun that shoots a flag reading “BANG” is pulled on a clown Trump lookalike. “Can you imagine what the outcry would be if @SnoopDogg, failing career and all, had aimed and fired the gun at President Obama? Jail time!” Trump tweeted Wednesday, three days after the video’s release. Ross, who has been an ardent critic of the President, is no stranger to Trump-related music controversies himself. In his 2015 song, “Free Enterprise,” he raps about assassinating Trump: “Assassinate Trump like I’m Zimmerman / Now accept these words as they came from Eminem.” Billboard reported in December 2015 that Walmart allegedly pulled Ross’ album off the shelves because of the lyric. Walmart did not return Billboard’s requests for comment. Ross has never shied away from expressing his political views, and his newest album touches on the issues he cares about. “The title, ‘Rather You Than Me,’ that’s just the perspective of a young black dude coming up in an urban community,” the Florida rapper said. “As soon as the music come on, just let the music talk to you. You know I’ve always been open and I speak my mind on whatever the topic may be.” The album, released Friday, includes songs like “Dead Presidents,” featuring Jeezy, Yo Gotti and Future, “Powers that Be,” featuring New York rapper Nas and “Maybach Music V,” featuring DeJ Loaf, which Ross described as “a really airy type of feeling record.” The hip-hop star got political at the Woodie Awards, which recognizes the music voted best by college students, telling the audience during the live broadcast on MTV that in this divided time, it’s good to get together and be united by music. “The Woodies always been cool to me because it was a spot you can see artists while they’re still underground, before they’ve achieved mainstream success,” he told CNN. “When I came and performed at the Woodies, that was real big for me.” El Paso R&B artist Khalid, who performed his hit “Location” at the show, won “Woodie to Watch,” and The Chainsmokers, who presented Khalid with the award, won “Woodie of the Year.” Ross told audiences during the live MTV broadcast that he would make a great president because he would “pass the kind of laws we can support,” and asked them to “Vote Rozay” — a reference to the rapper’s nickname, “Ricky Rozay.” Rick Ross says he would make a great president one day because he would pass laws people can support: 1️⃣ Mike Ice Cube's birthday a federal holiday 2️⃣ Free haircuts at the barbershop on Friday's 3️⃣ Buy @richforever's new album 4️⃣ Legalize marijuana everywhere #mtvwoodies #RickRoss #sxsw2017 #sxsw A post shared by دينا زرو (@deenazeina) on Mar 16, 2017 at 9:51pm PDT He jokingly outlined his platform, but also touched on issues that he cares about, such as marijuana legalization: “No. 1, we make Ice Cube’s birthday a federal holiday. Free haircuts at the barbershop on Fridays,” Ross joked. “No. 2, you all have to go out and buy my new album available at 12 a.m., baby! Of course, I’ll legalize marijuana everywhere. God bless, everybody! Vote Rozay!” His remarks drew loud cheers from the audience. Ross said this was his first time “hosting anything,” adding that above all, he knew he would have a good time doing it. “Me being a boss, I’m only going to have a good time,” he said. “That’s the only thing that matters.” 30.267153 -97.743061 Filed in: NewsFix Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Pinterest Reddit LinkedIn Email Got a Tip?

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Wal-Mart Stores Inc. acquired online apparel seller ModCloth Inc. in an all-cash deal, part of an effort to expand its online operations and appeal to customers that may have avoided the retailer in the past. ModCloth will continue to operate as a stand-alone site, as well as work with Wal-Mart’s other operations, the retail giant said on Friday. ModCloth Chief Executive Officer Matt Kaness and his 300-plus employees will join Wal-Mart’s e-commerce team. Terms of the transaction, which was completed on Friday, weren’t disclosed. The move follows Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Jet.com for $3.3 billion last year in a deal that revamped its web division and brought in a fresh team of e-commerce executives. Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon has vowed to turn the brick-and-mortar colossus into “more of a digital enterprise” that can better challenge Amazon.com Inc. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company also bought outdoor e-tailer Moosejaw last month, adding trendy brands like Patagonia and the North Face to its assortment. Founded in 2002 by Susan and Eric Koger, ModCloth began as a vintage clothing seller, hawking items hand-picked by Susan. The business grew into a $150 million retailer known for its whimsical dresses and quirky outfits for the retro girl, but it faltered in 2014 as struggling sales growth led to two rounds of layoffs. The business had run into a problem many niche fashion companies experience: being unable to attain mass appeal even though it had won over a patch of devout shoppers. The founders stepped aside and hired Kaness, a retail veteran and former Urban Outfitters Inc. executive, to help bring ModCloth into the mainstream. The brand dialed back on its more outlandish offerings, hoping to appeal to a broader range of women, and it created its first private-label apparel line. Then the company embarked on a physical retail expansion, opening pop-up shops as it honed an approach for an upcoming fleet of boutiques. In late 2016, it opened its first-ever permanent store in Austin, Texas. “Designers that sell on ModCloth who are interested in expanding their consumer reach will now have the opportunity to serve more customers through Jet.com and our other e-commerce sites,” Wal-Mart said in a statement Friday. © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

MAIN REVIEWS MOVIES TV MUSIC CELEBS ABOUT US Privacy Policy SUBMIT A GUEST POST Connect with us Shockya.com Shockya.com MAIN REVIEWS MOVIES TV MUSIC CELEBS ABOUT US Privacy Policy SUBMIT A GUEST POST Kenny Johnson Uncovers a Terrorist Plot at a Check Point as Thriller Released on Home Entertainment Share Tweet Kenny Johnson Uncovers a Terrorist Plot at a Check Point as Thriller Released on Home Entertainment By Karen Benardello Published on March 18, 2017 Share Tweet Comment Actor Kenny Johnson is embarking on a determined mission to protect America in his latest thriller, ‘Check Point.’ The timely war film shows how an insurgent attack is threatening to escalate into a full-blown invasion of the US. As a result, Johnson’s character, Roy, is leading a team of unlikely heroes in his fight against the enemy. Roy and his supporters’ attack on the terrorists can now be witnessed by audiences across the country, as the drama is now available on home entertainment. ‘Check Point’ has been distributed on all formats, including such online platforms as iTunes US, Google Play, Xbox, Amazon Instant, Amazon DVD, Vudu (Walmart online) and Playstation. The cable providers that are broadcasting the action thriller are Comcast, Cos, Time Warner Cable, Brighthouse, Verizon Fios, Frontier, Suddenlink, Charter, Mediacom, CenturyLink, Google Play, Dish, DirecTV and Blockbuster/Sling TV. The DVD retailers releasing the movie are Walmart, Best Buy, Amazon.com, Netflix, Redbox, and Military Base shops. Award-winning filmmaker Thomas J. Churchill wrote, directed and produced the movie. While discussing ‘Check Point,’ the helmer revealed, “I have written many scripts and produced (and) directed a few films. But nothing compared to where my mind went with ‘Check Point.'” Churchill added that “The idea of ‘Check Point’ was something that has been with me since 1987. At one time, I wanted to be in the service as my father, uncles, grandfather and even my brother served our country. But I realized that it takes a very special kind of person to wear the uniform and defend their country. At that time in my life, my mind drifted more to the cinema and I wanted to make movies…where people can escape their worries and problems and lose themselves for a bit and get caught up in the world of cinema.” In addition to Johnson, ‘Check Point’ stars an ensemble cast, including WWE Universal Champion Bill Goldberg, William Forsythe, Martial Arts Hall of Famer Mel Novak, Kane Hodder, Tyler Mane, Fred “The Hammer” Williamson, Former UFC Champion John Lewis and Krista Grotte. The thriller also features the last last on screen performance by the late Ricky Harris. ‘Check Point’ follows the result of what happens when a sleeper cell terrorist plot is discovered in a small town where everyone knows one another, or so they thought. Justice seems lost, especially when an insurgent attack threatens to escalate into a full-blown invasion of the US. But a team of unlikely heroes, who are led by Roy, rises up to protect their beloved country.

He is best known as the creator and editor of the popular economics blog Carpe Diem. At AEI, Perry writes about economic and financial issues for American.com and the AEIdeas blog.   Mark Perry Tweets Tweets by Mark_J_Perry What’s New on AEI We hear about US jobs outsourced overseas (or stolen), but what about the ‘insourced’ jobs we ‘steal’ from abroad? The G20 meeting: Score One for the Economic Nationalists Dan Griswold: The foreign stake in our economy continues to grow, but the net worth of Americans has grown even more Evidence and the Trump budget More options: Share, Mark as favorite Some economic lessons from the demise of Gander Mountain: creative destruction, consumer sovereignty, Amazon effect View related content: Carpe Diem The chart above shows the phenomenal 127.5% rise in Amazon’s stock over the last two years, compared to a 18.5% increase in the NASDAQ Index (green line), an 11.3% increase in Apple shares (red line), and a nearly 15% decrease in Wal-Mart stock (purple line) over that same period. That rise in Amazon’s stock price is from the “Amazon Effect” and the “Amazon Doctrine,” which are described below as they relate to an article in today’s Detroit Free Press titled “Gander Mountain latest sports retailer to fail.” Here’s an excerpt of that article (emphasis added): Outdoor goods company Gander Mountain is the latest retailer to falter under competition from online sellers, announcing that it has filed for bankruptcy protection and will close dozens of stores. The St. Paul, Minn-based chain says that it will begin shuttering 32 stores over the next several weeks. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday in the face of dwindling store traffic and shelves stocked with more goods than it was able to sell. Throughout the retail sector, traditional stores, from big box chains to specialty shops, have struggled to entice shoppers through their doors as consumers increasingly do their buying online. Last month, roughly 14% of retailers monitored by Moody’s Investors Service could be deemed “distressed.’’ And several chains have sought bankruptcy protection, including American Apparel, Wet Seal, and The Limited. But the sporting goods sector appears to be in particular peril, with e-commerce competitors often offering consumers more options for lower prices. There have been at least ten other bankruptcies among sports chains with over $10 million in liabilities in the last year and a half. Prior to Gander’s announcement, MC Sports was the most recent sports retailer to seek bankruptcy protection, saying last month that it would close 68 locations. That move that will wipe out 1,300 jobs throughout the Midwest. Others shutting their doors include Sports Authority, once the second biggest sports retail company in the U.S., which shuttered more than 400 locations when it liquidated last year. Golf equipment giant Golfsmith filed for bankruptcy protection in September, and Sport Chalet, a southern California-based chain closed in 2016 after being in business for 57 years. Here are some economic lessons from the demise of Gander Mountain: 1. The forces of creative destruction, including the destruction of jobs, are unstoppable and beneficial to the economy. Economic progress and job destruction go hand in hand, as economist Richard McKenzie explained in the Wall Street Journal 25 years ago. This recent wave of job destruction in the retail sector is a good thing, and should not be impeded or stopped.  That is something that Team Trump should keep in mind as they pursue their  misguided public-policy philosophy of jobism, which mistakenly makes the count of jobs the key measure of a country’s economic success or failure. While Team Trump is quick to blame outsourcing and international trade for US job losses, it’s important to recognize that the domestic forces of innovation, disruption, technological advances, creative destruction, competition and changing consumer tastes are even more to blame for the loss of jobs in this country. But while bankruptcies and job losses are usually reported as bad news, there is an upside to these business closings – they release resources and labor to be re-deployed to other sectors of the economy that are growing and are doing a better job of operating efficiently and pleasing consumers. To quote Richard McKenzie, “Revitalized competitiveness mandates a willingness to replace much that is old with much that is new. It requires widespread (not wanton) job destruction.” 2. Consumer sovereignty – consumers are the ultimate rulers (kings and queens) in the market economy and they — not producers — “run the show.” Producers, sellers and retailers are constantly at the mercy of consumers’ changing tastes, behavior, and buying habits. As US consumers increasingly prefer doing their shopping online for more convenience, greater selection, and lower prices, traditional brick-and-mortar stores will continue to struggle and many more will disappear. This trend should be welcomed as a sign of economic progress and job creation. To help the economy grow to its full potential, we have to be willing to tolerate (and welcome) job losses and business closings. 3. Consumer greed. While the term “greed” is frequently used for CEOs, corporations and businesses, it’s almost never used to describe the behavior of consumers. Just do a Google search of “corporate greed” and “consumer greed” and you see that there’s a ratio of about 67-to-1 in favor of “corporate greed.” But I think the term “greed” describes pretty accurately the behavior of most of us consumers, who have a laser-like focus on low prices, high quality, large selection and speedy delivery. Therefore, Gander Mountain’s demise should be blamed on “consumer greed.” If “greed” is too strong of a description, substitute the term”enlightened self-interest” to describe consumer behavior. But either way, if US consumers weren’t so damned concerned about low prices and their own convenience, Grander Mountain wouldn’t have declared bankruptcy. 4. The Amazon Effect is term used to describe the incredibly disruptive effects Amazon is having on the retail industry as it revolutionizes retailing, supply chain management and delivery, with a laser-like focus on creating value for consumers. Related to the Amazon Effect is Amazon’s official corporate version of consumer sovereignty known as The Amazon Doctrine (featured on CD here), summarized here: Above all else, align with customers. Win when they win. Win only when they win. There may be no other large company operating today that better illustrates the economic concepts of creative destruction and consumer sovereignty than Amazon – to the significant benefit of consumers, who are the direct beneficiaries of Amazon’s success as an internet-based online retailer. The remarkable rise in Amazon’s share price (illustrated above) is a market measure of its success at fulfilling The Amazon Doctrine of aligning with customers – its stock is winning in the market only because its customers are winning daily with low prices, a wide selection of great products and the convenience of shopping online from home – or from anywhere with a Smartphone. More than any other factors, it’s likely the combination of the Amazon Effect and Amazon Doctrine that are most responsible for Gander Mountain’s demise. Bottom Line: Here’s my economic forecast for the retail industry: Expect continued and very strong hurricane-strength Schumpeterian gales of innovation from the Amazon Effect, with a high likelihood of market disruption and creative destruction including more brick-and-mortar stores and jobs disappearing, accompanied by huge tsunami-level tidal waves of increased consumer surplus in the future. Hurricane Joseph (Schumpeter) and creative destruction are the consumer’s best friend, and ultimately the best friend of economic progress and job creation in the long run. Amazon Creative destruction Discussion: (74 comments) Tom March 14th, 2017 We agree! Though, the one I’m afraid of that is coming like a freight train aimed right at jobs is self driving vehicles. On one side I can’t wait because the benefits are huge… on the other side the large scale elimination of jobs all at once is going to be traumatic to say the least. Reply Share Michael March 15th, 2017 Tom I feel this is such flawed logic on your behalf. If we went back just 100 years and adopted this same mindset, what would be the affect moving from a more agriculture based society to information age vua automation of tractors, automation of industrialism, the advent of recent communication (radio, phone, tv, satellite, internet), air travel, supply chains, robotics, and the uncountable in numerous other inventions aided to benefit humanity. Should there be LESS jobs today give all this? In actuality aren’t there MORE jobs? I see no traumatic issue here. Reply Share Tom March 15th, 2017 I don’t think we’re in disagreement… but there will be trauma. It will be short term and then we’ll move on. But it could end up with violent protests etc until the economy can create new jobs to absorb the millions that will be laid off. Reply Share Barry March 15th, 2017 Fair point. The “transition” period will be tough for some people. Reply Share howard2374 March 16th, 2017 The ‘transition’ is always a tough period for some people. Change is constant, be prepared for change. Share morganovich March 16th, 2017 tom- 1. i think self driving cars are further off than many are currently claiming. 2. i think a shift to self drive is going to be gradual and a patchwork. the transition period will be long and further lengthened by laws and regulation. 3. the number of jobs this affects is likely about 1.5% of the US workforce. for such a shift to take place over, say, 5 years, is not going to be terribly tumultuous. we’ve had a great many transitions in employment far sharper than that. 4. but yes, if you are a long haul class 8 trucker, this is going to put pressure on you, though i doubt that pressure gets terribly intense for at least another decade, especially on interstate routes. 5. the natural attrition in that field alone swamps the impending automation. jobs may go away, but few people who were not leaving anyway will lose jobs. turnover in trucking jobs is 90%. there is currently an serious and persistent shortage of drivers. that alone will suck up the early parts of automation. i’m just having a hard time seeing how this winds up being a serious and damaging disruption. there’s lots of breathless media on it, but the facts seems to argue the opposite. Reply Share Warren Platts March 19th, 2017 Re: self-driving cars, consider this: at any given time, 15% of all drivers licenses are suspended, and 1 in 10 of drivers on the road at any moment doesn’t have a valid driver’s license, and there are many more “discouraged drivers”, if you will, that have ceased to drive and ceased to seek a new driver’s license. Discouraged workers probably many of them don’t have a license, and have given up on trying to get one, or the process just takes years, then when most job ads list a requirement for a valid driver’s license, they quit looking for work. Not to mention the number of jobs within walking distance can be limited in number and quality. So I predict if true self-driving cars where no one needed a license–if they’d let you do that–that would get a lot of discouraged workers back in the game, and be a big net stimulus to the economy. IMHO YMMV Share Jay March 16th, 2017 Don’t believe the breathless hype. It will be a long time before self driving cars dominate. The”devil is in the details” and those details are the hardest part. What will happen quickly are computer assisted safety systems. Reply Share lyle March 16th, 2017 Gartner has a curve on how technology is adopted and autonomous vehicles are listed at the peak of the hype cycle, soon to be falling into the valley of disillusionment. Their guess is 10+ years. Note that computer assisted safety systems are available today on higher end cars, systems such as forward crash mitigation, side blind spot alert, autonomous cruise control, rear object detection, can be had on many mid to high end vehicles but you will have to special order because dealers don’t feel in general that the features sell well. (Depends on city, they sell well in Austin, but not San Antonion for example a 1k add on Honda Sensing package is not common on San Antonio dealers lots but is common on Austin dealers lots.) Reply Share Ron H. March 16th, 2017 lyle What is a Honda Sensing package, and why would I want to detect Hondas? As common as they are, I would think my detection system would be alerting almost continuously, thus rendering the system virtually useless. More useful, perhaps, would be a Non-Honda detection system that only alerts when there are NO Hondas in my immediate vicinity. That probably happens only infrequently, and is something a driver might be interested in knowing. Share Tim March 16th, 2017 https://youtu.be/M_IrQO42RI8 Reply Share Marque2 March 14th, 2017 Ma y retail stores could do a better job of helping customers. I went to Best Buy, for instance, to look for a particular type of keyboard because I needed it right away. Staff person said, I think we have one in the back, and pointed in the general direction, leaving me to hunt it down. After saying it wasn’t right, I would have been happy if the staff person went on the BB web page and helped me order one, delivered to the store. No such luck. I pointed out I came to BB first before I went to Amazon, and then left the store. Though I do try to not purchase from Amazon any more because Bezos annoys me with his ham handed, supercilious political activism. I don’t know why he publically insults at least half his customers. If he gave to lefty causes in private like the Costco’s and the Progressives (insurance) I would be more comfortable. Reply Share Sprewell March 15th, 2017 Stores like Best Buy cannot afford to hire as many or as knowledgable sales staff to stand around waiting to help their lower customer traffic, which means people go there less, so they hire less and so on: a vicious cycle till they go out of business. Meanwhile, I can read a bunch of Amazon or Newegg reviews much more cheaply than hiring that sales staff and get exactly the keyboard I want. That is how the internet is killing off retail. I don’t know what “political activism” you think Bezos is involved with. People who try to figure out his politics aren’t really sure, but it’s probably libertarian. Of course, he’s no Trump fan, which is what probably annoys you, but likely agrees with him on deregulation and low taxes, while disliking his immigration and protectionist trade policies, both of which are standard views of most libertarians, such as most of the commenters here. That’s a fairly mixed view towards Trump: funny how you Trump fans always want to cast everybody as dead-set against Teflon Don, regardless of how nuanced their position is. PS, I considered Don almost as bad as Hillary, but the lesser of the two evils. I would never vote for either, and didn’t vote this time, but gun held to my head and only given those two to choose, it’d be Don every time, as I can’t stand Queen Hilldog and her entitled ways. The media completely covered up for how she was almost as dumb as Trump and worse on most policy issues. Reply Share howard2374 March 16th, 2017 I concur. However, stores like Best Buy should be places where people can go to see and touch the items, get person to person dialog about the object of interest, and be able to order on line and have the option of going to the store to pick up the item or have the item home delivered. Trying to get explinations over the phone, going through the ‘calling tree’ is not user friendly or information satisfying. Brick & Mortar must recognize their strengths, tout their advantages, and capitalize on it. Reply Share Sprewell March 16th, 2017 Yes, Ron and I discussed more than a year ago how some of the retail space might be kept around as showrooms, only for certain goods that need to be handled first, say a new smartphone. However, I don’t think an in-person or phone dialogue will be the way people get information, as that’s fairly outdated and doesn’t scale. You will simply tell your smartphone that you want a keyboard that is less than $10 and has a number pad and it will go find the ones that fit that description. You can’t go to the store for pick-up when they become showrooms exclusively, as it makes no sense to hold any inventory there, ie everything will just be delivered. With those exceptions, yes, some fraction of the retail space will be turned into showrooms and everything will be bought online. Reply Share lyle March 16th, 2017 It may work the way web ordering works at Best Buy today that you can pick up your order the next day. Or like Wal-Mart where it can be delivered to the nearest store. However Brick and Mortar have a problem that you might look at the merchandise and the order it on your smart phone. Reply Share Benjamin Cole March 14th, 2017 “That is something that Team Trump should keep in mind as they pursue their misguided public-policy philosophy of jobism, which mistakenly makes the count of jobs the key measure of a country’s economic success or failure.”—-Perry. Well… A nation with labor shortages is a happy nation—and one in which the public can be expected to think “free enterprise seems to work.” The policies of the last 40 years in the US have instead consistently promoted looser labor markets. The fe facto open borders policy; the the de facto Federal Reserve position that at least one in 20 Americans who want work must instead be unemployed; the laws against push-cart vending or truck-vending; the property-zoning laws limiting retailing only to those spaces zoned retail. Though debatable, it appears we tax exports heavier than imports. If the above is the playing field, and I think it is, I do not blame the public for voting for Trump or Sanders. I like more jobs in America. The more the better. I hope to hear whining about “labor shortages.” Music to my ears. Reply Share Michael Hutton March 15th, 2017 I essentially agree with Prof Perry’s take on creative destruction. But….what happens when a free market doesn’t work. Is it possible that market forces can lead a nation in a disastrous direction for any number of reasons? Corporations can, for example, cheat and rig a a free market market in their favor. When that endeavor collapses, resources are not deployed more efficiently. Instead, people’s lives are destroyed through no fault of their own. Does any of that aspect apply here? Reply Share Jon Murphy March 15th, 2017 An answer to your question depends on what you mean by “Corporations can, for example, cheat and rig a a free market market in their favor. “ Reply Share Michael Hutton March 15th, 2017 The ways that corporations cheat are varied and creative. In 2015, the Chicago Sun Times (among others) reported a settlement between the Justice Department and five giant banks that “had engaged in the biggest price-fixing conspiracy in modern history. Their self-described “cartel” used an exclusive electronic chat room and coded language to manipulate the $5.3 trillion-a-day currency exchange market. It was a “brazen display of collusion” that went on for years, said Attorney General Loretta Lynch.” But there will be no trial, no executive will go to jail, the banks can continue to gamble in the same currency markets, and the fines – although large – are a fraction of the banks’ potential gains and will be treated by the banks as costs of doing business. Reply Share Not Sure March 15th, 2017 If the government is letting corporations cheat, you can’t honestly say the problem is that “the free market doesn’t work”, can you? Reply Share Michael Hutton March 15th, 2017 No, that’s not correct. It’s not the government is letting corporations cheat. The issue is that some corporations are not satisfied with taking their best shot in a market or simply trying — through better business models — to achieve a competitive advantage. They’re rigging the free market. Sometimes they are caught and then they stop doing the illegal activity — we hope. But, an unregulated free market will always be abused. How should that be dealt with? We’ve already seen that CEOs and others are not held accountable for illegal actions. We’ve also seen that CEOs are rarely held accountable for being stupid, that is, they rarely suffer the consequences of foolish or ill-advised actions in the market; such as, the risk that Bob Rubin allowed Citigroup to take from 2007-2009. While they were being bailed out by the government, he was raking-in something like $126 million in cash and stock. Anyway, I’ve wandered far afield of the original comment and my question. My question is: are their legitimate actions a government can or should take in the face of creative destruction? Share Ron H. March 15th, 2017 Michael “My question is: are their legitimate actions a government can or should take in the face of creative destruction?” No. No there is not Share Not Sure March 15th, 2017 “It’s not the government is letting corporations cheat.” Who runs the Justice Department? Share Ron H. March 15th, 2017 Not “Who runs the Justice Department?” Hmm. I think you’re on to something. Until recently it was that despicable Loretta Lynch who never indicted a criminal in her entire career. Share Not Sure March 15th, 2017 Wasn’t she working as a government employee in that capacity? Share Dan J March 15th, 2017 Seems a highly regulated market like banking was/is abusive. For over 100years, a bank can’t sneeze without having a regulator there questioning them on whether they sneezed into their hands, arm, or openly allowing droplets to spread. Banks are bent over a barrel, pants down, yet eager as they know govt will protect them from the market. A quid pro quo, but govt has the leverage. Share Ron H. March 15th, 2017 Lynch? Im Not Sure about that. I do know she was a Clinton employee. Share Jon Murphy March 16th, 2017 Michael- Forgive the late reply. It is true that there is nothing capitalists hate more than capitalism, and they will go to extreme lengths to prevent free markets from forming, but most (if not all) of their actions can only be successful though the power of the State. Regulation, protectionism, taxes, etc can all be used by companies to squash competition and the free market. Market manipulations are considerably harder if the market is freer. This is why I asked my question. Knowing what you had in mind helps me shape my answer. As for your example of rate manipulation, I’m afraid I don’t know any specific details, so I won’t comment on that directly, save to make a more generalized point: Cartels and monopolies are sometimes the result of free markets; do not confuse “free market” with “perfectly competitive market.” Indeed, sometimes monopolies can be desirable to perfectly competitive markets (sometimes it’s better to have one seller than no sellers). Share Robert Guzauskas March 15th, 2017 I appreciate Creative Destruction in free markets. Ours are not free. Example: Health care. Insurers and Providers established State laws that restrict business operations and interstate movement and competition. Those laws kill people and bankrupt people and business’. Unregulated Nepotism is another destroyer. Look at Wall Street and Hollywood for examples. Reply Share Jon Murphy March 15th, 2017 So free the markets. Problem solved. Reply Share Ron H.

We today are dealing with many disruptive technologies that perhaps should not be the sole domain of any one individual. The Wal-Mart effect showed this and so does the Amazon effect. The rate increase today is only for the benefit of the too big to fail China bond holders and Wall St.benefit. This is the controlled creative destruction of animal spirits I see. If you want the real story about how and why these things keep happening go see and Pam Martens at WallStreetonParade.com and get educated.

Ms. Martens worked on Wall Street for 21 years. Ms. Martens’ earlier career was in publishing.” You won’t learn anything from two publishers who know little about finance or investing. Reply Share Ron H. March 15th, 2017 William “Not so sure that the extreme wealth and political power hoarding of Mark Zuckerburg , Bill Gates, Carlos Slim or any other self gratifying oligarch is a good thing for any economy in terms of democracy or sovereignty.” How did those people become wealthy? Did they provide something to customers that those customers valued to the extent that a lot of customers willing handed over a lot of money to get what these wealthy people were offering? Reply Share Sprewell March 16th, 2017 Yes, let’s look at how they became so rich. Bill Gates worried back in the’90s that big companies would “patent some obvious thing” and come after him, then proceeded to do the same to everyone else. Carlos Slim used connections to wrangle telecom monopolies, minting money as the only option in many markets. Zuckerberg tricked a bunch of people into giving him a lot of their personal data, which he sells to a bunch of advertisers so they can track and market to their customers better. While I’m sure all are competent businessmen, what distinguishes them more than anything else is their sharp elbows in their drive to the top, ie the willingness to make shady decisions in order to get as rich as possible, not just centi-millionaires but billionaires at the top of the list of the world’s richest. In Bill and Carlos’s cases, they used questionable tactics and govt force to keep competition out. Zuck simply profits off the naivety of the public, which will inevitably end badly once the privacy scandals hit. So while William’s probably got some confused case about what to do about all this- no doubt he wants to empower the very govt that these crony capitalists use to get so rich, making the problem worse- he’s not wrong in implying their rise was not exactly clean. Reply Share Ron H. March 16th, 2017 Sprewell “Yes, let’s look at how they became so rich.” Yes, let’s: Gates and Slim enlisted the sharp elbows of government to get as rich as possible. Nothing unusual about that. It is the nature of the game. The solution is to make government elbows unavailable. Nonetheless, money was handed to them by willing customers who valued the product or service more than the money they paid to get it. Zuckerberg offered people something “free” in exchange for their personal information. Whether or not early adopters knew the price they were paying, by now, everyone in the world should be aware of the arrangement, and yet millions find the price acceptable. Reply Share Sprewell March 17th, 2017 Nonetheless, money was handed to them by willing customers who valued the product or service more than the money they paid to get it. No, money was handed to them by unwilling customers who had no choice of other sellers to buy from. That’s the whole point of a monopoly. As for Zuck, his customers are the advertisers, as they’re the ones who pay him, no point in talking about the suckers whose privacy he sells to them. I’m sure he provides the ad guys with plenty of useful data, but they have to wonder how long that will last. Reply Share Ron H. March 17th, 2017 “No, money was handed to them by unwilling customers who had no choice of other sellers to buy from. That’s the whole point of a monopoly.” None of those customers could have bought from Apple? Speaking of monopolies, a study of gates rise riches is a great argument against the patent system. “ I’m sure he provides the ad guys with plenty of useful data, but they have to wonder how long that will last.” I suspect that will last as long as people enjoy using Facebook. I see no lessening of people’s insatiable desire to know what everybody they know is doing today, hour by hour. Reply Share Briguy March 16th, 2017 Wonder what would happen to amazon’s costs if the taxpayer didn’t subsidize the post office and Fedex (through its arrangement to have the post office deliver fedex packages to out of the way locations) and lets not forget amazon’s not paying sales taxes for many, many years. As I see amazon lose control of the quality of its products through the sheer enormity of the vendors it allows to sell through its website ( the descriptions of technical items are often just wrong) I also wonder how much more it can grow Reply Share Jon Murphy March 16th, 2017 Given Amazon is moving toward its own logistics model (drones, delivery trucks, etc), I don’t think your concerns are too warranted. Further, the fact Amazon didn’t pay sales tax has nothing to do with their costs. That’s a cost to the customer. Reply Share Ron H. March 16th, 2017 briguy “Wonder what would happen to amazon’s costs if the taxpayer didn’t subsidize the post office and Fedex (through its arrangement to have the post office deliver fedex packages to out of the way locations …” The USPS charges for every package it delivers. If that charge is inadequate for any reason, including subsidies, your complaint is with the USPS, not Amazon or FedEx. Do you ever complain that you aren’t paying the full cost when you mail something to an out-of-the-way place? Do you attach additional postage to assuage your guilt? Reply Share Briguy March 16th, 2017 John – so if it cost $100 to mail vs $10 it wouldn’t afffect sales? Need to rethink that one! Only the govt could continue that subsidy as long as it has, any private business would have long ago changed their rates, gone out if business, or, like FedEx, figure out how to transfer the loser shipments to someone else Reply Share Jon Murphy March 16th, 2017 Ok…not sure what this has to do with my response to you. Reply Share Briguy March 16th, 2017 So the consumer isn’t aware that they save 8-10% by not paying sales tax? Really? Need to rethink that concept. Reply Share Jon Murphy March 16th, 2017 You’re right. The customer is aware they’re saving 8-10% by not paying sales tax. That’s my whole point: it’s a cost to the consumer, not Amazon. Reply Share William Ryan March 16th, 2017 If your only goal in life is to MSV and nothing for all those who make that possible then you have a fatally flawed business model . Creating wealth and efficiency has to be more than an end to it self. It must be for the benefit of the people in society in general and not just the share holders only interest.

March 16th, 2017 I would imaging the consumer is well aware, and chooses the lower overall price for that reason, but the problem is government manipulation of the market by favoring one type of transaction over another, not the business model of the retailer. Do you recommend charging some consumers higher prices as a remedy? Reply Share Jon Murphy March 17th, 2017 Another thought, Briguy, (which I must admit I am embarrassed I didn’t bring up earlier), on your raised concerns: Eliminating subsidies for the USPS et al and the sales tax thing would be an industry-wide issue, not just Amazon. Yes, Amazon’s costs (shipping) and their customers’ costs (taxes) would rise. So would all their competitors’. You wouldn’t change the relative rankings or even the major point of Mark’s post. Some decimal points may be moved around, but that’s it. Reply Share William Ryan March 17th, 2017 Now you two idiots are going to try to tell me that it is not a political problem but a purely economic problem? More b.s. and more nonsense from the peanut gallery. If the oligarchs who control and dominate most world trade by any measure, which they do. Have extreme wealth hoarding of political power and control ,which they do. And absolute power leads to absolute corruption. And everybody knows this,Then how can you say it is only a surplus or deficit problem of simple accounting book keeping? You are only talking about the numbers off some chart. I’m talking about bringing back real livable wage manufacturing jobs back to America so we make thinks here again and consume our own goods made here again. The specifically targeted BAT will do that and so will the MAC. It was flawed government economic policy set by idiots like you that allowed companies to leave the country to make things cheaper overseas eliminate American jobs and to ship cheaper goods back into the country unfairly and with no penalty. Where was your economic blog back when all that happened? Nowhere to be found as you and many other sat by and did or said nothing about it. The -$500B trade deficit per year just with China may only mean money numbers on charts to you But we are talking about jobs, plants and whole communities devastated by the largest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. This is not political? Please spare me the torture of your ignorance! Reply Share Jon Murphy March 17th, 2017 Simply put, protectionism costs jobs. It does not (in fact, cannot, create them). Further, if the issue is, as you say: ” If the oligarchs who control and dominate most world trade by any measure, which they do. Have extreme wealth hoarding of political power and control ,which they do. And absolute power leads to absolute corruption,” then the issue is to reduce the power of government and the oligarchs in power, not increase it. After all, who do you think is calling for the very protectionist measures you demand? The oligarchs… Reply Share Sprewell March 17th, 2017 Funny how ignorant idiots like yourself see your faults in everyone else. 🙂 There is an easy way to get the outcome you want: go tell all your fellow Americans not to buy Chinese and only buy American. No need to pass laws: they all agree with you about your obvious points, I’m sure. They won’t listen to you? Well, now you know the root of the “problem:” most of your fellow Americans would rather buy cheaply from the Chinese than from you! 😀 Of course, there’s the whole fact that your beloved “real livable wage manufacturing jobs” were an artifact of the post-WWII boom and the global manufacturing base not coming online yet, never to be repeated again. The only jobs left in manufacturing are either highly technical, which your buddies are too dumb to do, or highly painstaking, which millions of Asians are willing to do for pennies, at wages you no doubt think are not livable. Keep dreaming that you can go back into some imagined halcyon past, it’s not going to happen.

You need to read something more than the WAPO , the NYTimes and the MSNM to really know and understand what is really happening with trade and many other things happening in the world today…As for not sure that is an appropriate name to choose since you seem to thing that Wal-Mart junk and toymaking ares more important industries to protect that our national security that manufacturing provides.

Soros, Democrats, and Republicans are constantly fighting against free trade. They’re not fighting to make it so. That’s my whole point. Murphy you really have your hat on backwards. Perhaps, but you’ve not really explained to me why. If the problem is oligarchs control the government and use it to profit, how will increasing the power of the government and increasing the incentive of oligarchs to capture government reduce the problem? Yes, I may just be a simpleton, but that just don’t make sense to me. Surely you, in your enlightened glory, could take pity on a poor fool and explain why I am wrong. Reply Share Not Sure March 17th, 2017 There were a number of strawmen in there, too. Reply Share William Ryan March 17th, 2017 Murphy so called “free trade ” is a buzz word the oligarchs use for one way trade. Got it. If it were really fair and free then we would most likely not be running these huge trade deficits with China and others. WE need greater democratic controls of world trade from America and all trading countries so to follow the rules of the road in global world trading not to be giving any one country and unfair economic advantage. But the root problem being China does not believe in democracy or human rights only in the ever expanding of their military power from the economic surplus we gave them as they created a 20-30-M middle class that is now on par with our wages…The other moronic twit that I keep hearing is that Americans wealth per capita is now at $237,000 per person. This is hog wash as all the wealth gained in the past 10 years has gone to the top 1%. Not a very good way to measure a countries wealth or economic progress as we will surely get the “Canadian Disease” where the citizens get little to no investment from the old wealth hoarding billionaires. Perhaps you should take a look at Michael Hudson’s book “J is for Junk Economics” so you can see the bigger more accurate picture of things economically. Reply Share Jon Murphy March 17th, 2017 Ok…wow. lot going on here. 1) If it were really fair and free then we would most likely not be running these huge trade deficits with China and others.

The statistics I see say otherwise. Their middle class wages are about 1/10th ours.

Google reveals nothing Reply Share William Ryan March 17th, 2017 Murphy have you been drinking too much green beer today or what? Let me help teach you a bit. “Canadian Disease” in my notes implies super slow GDP growth. I saw it used by Guy Rolnik on Pro Market @ U. of Chicago Booth School of Business meaning “by using pyramids or monopolies old money often does not grow well”…Over at Manufacturing.Net and EPI.com have shown many articles that state that the Chinese are now on about equal pay with Americans in manufacturing…Greater democratic controls needed for globalism comes from too many books to list here but I,ll give you one.

Not sure what you think this link says that supports your contention. It works against you, actually. Reply Share Warren Platts March 19th, 2017 Interesting article on the great success of AMZN, but it’s actually an argument for Hamiltonian protections. In a perfect world, the management of Gander Mountain would redirect their capital and convert their sporting goods retail shops into sporting goods manufacturing, then rehiring the retail staff to be makers, who at least would have a pre-existing knowledge of the sporting goods world. Workers make more money, and management does too because now the number of their customers isn’t limited to a small geographic area, because they’re selling through Amazon. As it is, this cannot happen, because of our free-trade economic policies. We should instead follow the advice of Alexander Hamilton, whose economic theory was the mainstream view for 200 years, and institute some judicious protections for our manufacturing sector–the same thing they do in Germany and China. If, through protections, we can encourage 1 million new manufacturing jobs, 3 million other jobs will be created because of the manufacturing multiplier effect, and could be filled by displaced retail workers. Reply Share Ron H. March 19th, 2017 Warren But where will the extra money come from to pay the higher prices necessary to pay the New American workers? Yours is pretty much the same argument used to advocate for a higher minimum wage. Where does the money for the higher wage come from? Higher manufacturing employment can only result from higher demand for manufactured products, which can only occur if more people have more money to spend. You cannot literally lift yourself by your bootstraps. Increasing the amount and cost of labor doesn’t result in prosperity. Better standards of living result from capital investment, which increases productivity, which reduces the number of jobs required per dollar of output. Maybe it isn’t more jobs that are needed but more output per job so consumers can buy more for the same amount of money. Here’s an example of lot’s of jobs, but I doubt these guys get paid much. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mctUNUQSJCo Reply Share Warren Platts March 20th, 2017 Your analysis ignores the fact that consumers are not just consumers. They are also people that are either working, or on the dole. If the cost of stuff goes up by 20%, but you are making 200% more than the unemployment insurance you were getting, are you better off? A: Yes. Reply Share Jon Murphy March 20th, 2017 For that the hold true, Warren, you’d need such an effect for everyone. Since, by design, tariffs only help a certain group, then it is not true that people will be better off following a tariff hike. Gordon Tullock has written a ton on this matter (as have Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Frederic Bastiat, Milton Friedman, etc). Reply Share Ron H. March 20th, 2017 Warren “Your analysis ignores the fact that consumers are not just consumers. They are also people that are either working, or on the dole. ” Yes, but the ultimate goal of all production is consumption. We produce in order to consume. That which best satisfies each of us as consumers is the best use of productive resources. People sometimes picture production as a goal in itself, but it isn’t. “If the cost of stuff goes up by 20%, but you are making 200% more than the unemployment insurance you were getting, are you better off? A: Yes.” That’s true for those few who become employed, but the many who are already employed become worse off due to the higher prices. There are deadweight losses involved with imposing import tariffs which means that on net, we are worse off as a society, than before. The cost is greater than the benefit.

There are far better ways to shrink the federal budget deficit. By Gene Epstein Biography March 18, 2017 “Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don’t love it,” Donald Trump told The Wall Street Journal shortly before his inauguration, noting that the proposed border adjustment tax was “too complicated.” Trump isn’t always right when he makes off-the-cuff remarks such as that, but this time he was. The proposed border adjustment tax is so complicated that even its advocates can’t agree on how its disruptive effects on the U.S. economy will play out, and there’s nothing to love about that.

Saint Clair police said the crash occurred as Douglas Mennig, 54, of 610 N. Third St., Pottsville, was driving a 2008 Ford Fusion north on Route 61 while a 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, operated by William F. Shafransky, 84, of 21 Trailer Road, Ringtown, was being driven south on Route 61. Police said Shafransky was turning into the Walmart plaza when the two vehicles collided in the intersection. Both drivers were taken to a Pottsville hospital for treatment while two passengers in the Mennig vehicle — Karen Rohrbach and Felicia Baltra, both of 4 Sammy Mobile Home Park, Schuylkill Haven — escaped injury. Police said their investigation into the crash is continuing and that Saint Clair firefighters assisted at the scene. Police: Man harassed woman ASHLAND — A 40-year-old borough man was arrested by state police at Frackville and charged in connection with an incident March 11 at Ashland Bar and Grill. Police said Michael J. Barry became involved in a verbal argument with a 33-year-old Shamokin woman and at some point displayed a 10-inch knife and asked the woman to go outside. Barry was asked to leave the business by staff members but returned later, approached the woman again, prompting the two to become involved in a physical altercation that had to be stopped by patrons. Barry was charged with harassment and disorderly conduct and will now have answer before Magisterial District Judge Christina E. Hale, Frackville, police said.

On Friday, the Glen Carbon Walmart store had been collecting toys, books, clothes, and other necessities that will be given to the children. Store employees also stood outside of the store collecting money from customers. "The community cares about them," said assistant store manager Melinda Maple, "and each of us cares about their well-being and we want to see them thrive and we want to see them do well and we are going to do everything that we can to make sure they are being taken care of." A few miles away at Edwardsville High School, the Little Tigers Football and Edwardsville Wrestling clubs also set up donation boxes to collect items. It's something that many in the community said is a duty and wouldn't think twice about. "We want to be there to show them that it's not just about the tragic loss," said football club president Eddie Lowry. "It's about people coming behind them and we are going to support them and that people are good at heart." There was no shortage of parents, grandparents, and kids doing their part to show their support. "Having three kids, especially an 8-month-old, I just can't imagine what they are going through," said Sean McMeen, a father of three, "but coming out here and just supporting the organizations and the community is just unbelievable and it's what I expect from this area." The store will continue taking donations through the weekend. To make a monetary donation, visit www.littletigersfootball.com.

(AP) — Just because President Trump may weaken U.S. fuel economy requirements, don’t expect gas guzzlers like the giant 13 mpg Hummer H1 to make a comeback. Executives from automakers and suppliers gathered at a conference said looser fuel economy standards might allow for sales of more trucks in areas where they’re popular. But otherwise, the pursuit of fuel-efficiency technologies would proceed unabated. ___ S&P 500 limps to the finish line in another winning week NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks limped into the weekend with mixed results on Friday, but the market nevertheless capped off yet another winning week. Gains for dividend-paying stocks offset drops for banks and health care stocks. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index delivered its seventh week of gains in the last eight, following a big rally sparked by the Federal Reserve’s announcement on interest rates. ___ Wells Fargo CEO: Fixing fake accounts will take more time NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan said the company could need several more months to resolve customer damage tied to its massive sales practices scandal. That includes figuring out if people had trouble getting approved for other loans because of the fake accounts bank employees opened. Speaking with The Associated Press, Sloan reiterated what he [auth] has said since becoming CEO in the wake of the scandal, that rebuilding trust with customers is the primary focus. ___ NEW YORK (AP) — Trumpism is slowly taking hold on your phone and computer, as the Federal Communications Commission starts chipping away at hard-fought protections on privacy and competition. These measures, put in place before President Donald Trump took office, had upset the phone and cable industries. The new regime says consumers win if businesses face less regulation and have more incentives to invest. ___ Wal-Mart buys online clothing seller ModCloth NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart is buying trendy online clothing selling ModCloth. The company has been making a big push to pick up smaller online brands as it tries to make headway against Amazon. But winning over ModCloth’s customers, who are fans of its vintage-inspired patterned dresses and inclusive sizing, may be a challenge. ___ Slammer sale: Closed prisons are a tough sell, states find ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — States are having a hard time selling places where prisoners have done hard time. Developers say thick-walled cell blocks and dormitories at closed prisons tend to be too expensive to tear down, and too restrictive to turn into viable enterprises. In New York, a mountaintop site in the Adirondacks has sat on the market for a year despite stunning views and other amenities. ___ US, global partners wrestle over trade stance BADEN-BADEN, Germany (AP) — Top finance officials are debating what stance to take on free trade at a meeting that will help set the tone for the global economy. The gathering of finance ministers and central bank heads from the Group of 20 countries has focused on shifting attitudes toward trade, particularly after U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to impose border taxes and rewrite free trade deals. ___ “Soda tax” stakes escalate in pivotal Philadelphia fight PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Philadelphia has become a pivotal battleground in the beverage industry’s push to stop “soda taxes” from gaining momentum. Since a new tax on sweetened drinks went into effect Jan. 1, a coalition of businesses looking to overturn the tax say sales are down so much they need to cut jobs. Tax supporters question the announcements of layoffs so soon after the tax went into effect, and note beverage distributors and supermarkets aren’t required to pass on the entire cost of the tax to shoppers. ___ Israeli tech firms revving up engines for self-driving cars JERUSALEM (AP) — As the world moves toward an era of self-driving cars, Israel is positioning itself to be the Detroit of the future. The country has emerged as a global leader in the fast-growing field of driverless cars, as illustrated by Intel’s more than $15 billion acquisition of Israeli firm Mobileye this week. ___ Dallas offers cautionary tale as it moves to fix 911 woes DALLAS (AP) — Dallas has been experiencing disruptions in its 911 service that began in October and at one point last week resulted in 360 calls being placed on hold. More dispatchers have been assigned to field 911 calls and technological glitches have been fixed, which should smooth operations, a city spokeswoman said Friday. But the problems plaguing Dallas can be found with other 911 systems that rely on increasingly obsolete networks that are incompatible with new technologies and protocols. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.93 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,914.62. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index slipped 3.13 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,378.25. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.24 points, or 0.004 percent, to 5,901.00. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 3 cents to settle at $48.78 per barrel. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, rose 2 cents to $51.76 per barrel. Natural gas rose 5 cents to $2.95 per 1,000 cubic feet. Wholesale gasoline inched up less than a cent to $1.60 per gallon, and heating oil rose a fraction of a penny to $1.51 per gallon.

MST March 17, 2017 A Phoenix police officer arrests a woman in a car at a Walmart March 17, 2017. (Photo: Screengrab from Facebook) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST PHOENIX - A Phoenix Walmart parking lot erupted in screams and vulgarities as a police officer forcefully arrested a woman accused of shoplifting Thursday afternoon. The woman, 26-year-old Delores Imboden, shouted that the officer was choking her while inside a car in the parking lot. Dozens of people gathered around with cellphones to record the violent arrest, during which the officer hit Imboden and threatened to shoot as she fought against being handcuffed and taken out of the car. Police say Imboden bit the officer before he "used strikes to prevent any further injury to himself." According to police, the bite came as the officer reached to turn off the car, which the driver refused to do. The video is on Facebook and may be upsetting to some viewers. Police have not provided the officer's name. Police say the driver, now-arrested Steven Katzeek, was holding on to Imboden, keeping the officer from pulling her out of the car. They also said Katzeek began driving forward slowly during the altercation. Police officials said security personnel and the officer, who was working off-duty in the area, had monitored Imboden via security camera in the store as she put merchandise in a duffel bag and started walking toward the exit. According to police, as the officer approached the exit, Imboden put down the bag and ran for the exit, getting into the car driven by Katzeek. The video begins shortly after, with the officer on top of Imboden, trying to handcuff her. Eventually, she was dragged out of the car by two officers and handcuffed. A third officer got Katzeek out of the car and handcuffed him. Police said they recovered stolen merchandise and drug paraphernalia from the scene. Imboden was booked on one count of resisting arrest and one count of shoplifting. Katzeek was booked on one count of hindering prosecution. © 2017 KPNX-TV CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Anti-Trump billboard artist gets death threats Two crashes results in 3 deaths, 16th patients Shoplifting arrest caught on camera Giraffe Birth Facts Controversial billboard of President Trump in Phoenix Must-watch: Rock-crawling buggy lands amazing drop Arizona Teachers: Underpaid and overburdened Wheat heart 3 secrets to finding deals on Amazon Fatal crash on I-17 at Pinnacle Peak More Stories 9-year-old boy shot, killed in north Phoenix Mar 20, 2017, 3:05 p.m. High school teacher explains why she 'loathes'… Mar 20, 2017, 6:13 p.m. Man arrested, suspected of having sex with goat Mar 20, 2017, 1:17 p.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home Weather 7 Day Forecast Health Detail Weather Alerts Closings & Delays Location Search Conditions More...

The supermarket chain, which operates multiple stores in Birmingham and across the West Midlands, is removing products from its shelves after a row concerning the Slimzone Range. The Slimzone ready meals, launched in January, included ingredients which were classed as "free" under the Slimming World diet plan. But a spokesman for the Walmart-owned supermarket confirmed on Sunday it was removing the 12 meals from shelves because of the method used by the weight loss organisation to assess whether ready meals were "free" or not. Asda introduced its Slimzone range of 13 frozen meals and meat products last month Read More Slimming World news: Legal action launched over Asda diet food range The spokesman said: "We take great pride in the integrity of the claims we make about our products. "Recent information has come to light indicating that the method used by Slimming World to assess whether a ready meal is free or not, surprisingly, is partly subjective and involves more than simply making food with free ingredients. "Slimzone was always intended to bring more choice and lower prices to customers shopping for healthy frozen ready meals but because of this new information, we have chosen to remove the range while we consider the best option for our customers." Read More Male stripper SHORTAGE - here's how you apply for the job The meal packs included a statement informing customers that the range was not endorsed by Slimming World. Supermarket Iceland sells a range of ready meals which is endorsed by the diet plan. A spokesperson for Slimming World said: "Slimming World has been engaged in a legal action to ask Asda to remove our trademarks (Slimming World, Free and Extra Easy) from their Slimzone meals since the range launched in January. "Asda’s decision to withdraw the meals comes just before a court hearing next week in which we were seeking an injunction over the trademark issue. "We have been open with Asda and our members about the fact that we were unable to give an accurate value for the Slimzone meals, and that our evaluation process for ready meals is complex, and has subjective as well as objective aspects. "Although we repeatedly asked Asda to give us a more detailed breakdown of the ingredients used so that we could make an accurate assessment, they would not supply those details – so we were unable to confirm whether or not the meals would be designated as Free Food on Slimming World’s healthy eating plan. "It’s never been our intention to prevent Asda from selling healthy meals that help people lose weight – our concern has been about our trademarks, and we hope that Asda will be able to relaunch the range without relying on Slimming World’s trademarks or name."

Shruti Srivastava India’s department of industrial policy and promotion is considering allowing 100% FDI in products which carry the Made-in-India label, says an official. Photo: Hindustan Times New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is considering easing rules for foreign retailers if they agree to sell more locally produced goods, according to an official with knowledge of the matter. Global companies with a permit to sell local food items — Amazon.com Inc. is reported to have applied for a license — may also be allowed to market made-in-India non-food products such as toothpaste and towels worth about 25% of total sales, the official said, asking not to be identified citing rules on speaking to the media. India may also allow more foreign direct investment (FDI) in multibrand retail if companies such as Wal-mart Stores Inc. and Carrefour SA agree to stock only local products. While India already offers 100% ownership in food and 51% in multibrand retail, there are few takers due to strict rules including those that require companies to put half their investment into warehouses and other back-end infrastructure. Retail is a sensitive subject in India, and tough opposition to slash rules comes from within Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party because its traditional support base has been small traders. This month’s broad, decisive win in state polls can embolden Modi to overlook some of this opposition as he struggles to create jobs before national elections in 2019. While India is dotted with mom-and-pop stores that employ local residents, these jobs aren’t well paying and don’t offer the insurance and leave benefits that typically accompany a formal employment contract. Make-in-India The proposals can also help Modi’s flagship Make-in-India campaign to boost local manufacturing. While India attracted $324 billion foreign direct investment from 2000 through the end of 2016, the biggest share of $58 billion has gone to services and only about $14 billion has come into trading. About 44% of India’s $620 billion retail market comprises food and grocery items, said Arvind Singhal, chairman at consultancy firm Technopak Advisors Pvt. While the sector has been growing by 12 percent each year, foreign companies are staying away because the government’s policies are too restrictive or confusing, he said. India’s department of industrial policy and promotion is considering allowing 100% FDI in products which carry the Made-in-India label, the official said. An external company handling media relations for Amazon didn’t immediately comment on a report that Amazon has sought a food retail license. JP Mattu, spokeswoman of the commerce and industry ministry, didn’t answer calls to her mobile phone on Friday.

(AP) — A battle pitting big-box retail giants including Menards and Wal-Mart against Wisconsin towns and cities is headed to the Legislature. Republican-backed proposals, written in conjunction with the League of Wisconsin Municipalities, are designed to close the so-called dark store loophole and increase how much the mega-retailers pay local communities in property taxes. The bills come in reaction to court rulings in Wisconsin and nearby Midwestern states — starting in Michigan — that have helped the retail giants lower the value placed on their stores for levying property taxes. The retailers have successfully challenged their tax assessments in communities across Wisconsin, and the Midwest, by arguing they are overtaxed and should pay the same rate as a store that is closed and vacant. Sponsored Content: Why Governance, Risk and Compliance is Everyone’s Business - Download the Executive Brief Today. That results in a shift of the property tax burden to smaller retail stores and property owners, said Jerry Deschane, executive director of the League of Municipalities. Advertisement “We just think that’s fundamentally unfair,” he said. “The bottom line with the property tax is it has to be uniform.” The cities will have to overcome opposition from the powerful state chamber of commerce and deep-pocketed retail giants that stand to lose millions from a change in current practice. Wisconsin Department of Revenue rules require that assessments be based on the fair market value of a property. The stores argue that the value of the underlying real estate should be determined by looking at comparable building sales, prices that usually fall far below the assessment of an operating store. Assessing the building as if it were empty has long been the standard in Wisconsin for determining its value, said Don Millis, a Madison attorney who has represented Target and other retailers in assessment challenges. Millis is also lobbying for the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce against changes to the law. “You value the sticks, bricks and mud,” Millis said. Cities have been incorrectly assessing the property based on the potential lease value, he said. “We don’t think they’re being undervalued,” he said. “We think assessors are being overly aggressive.” But Republican state Sen. Duey Stroebel, who plans to introduce a bill next month addressing the issue, said the potential lease value of the property should be considered when valuing it for tax purposes. That is what the bill he and others are working on will do, he said. Millis warned that changing the law “could have long-term unintended consequences” affecting how all property is valued. Big box stores including Menards, Lowe’s and ShopKo have filed more than 20 lawsuits against Wisconsin municipalities in the past year challenging their property assessments. In one, Menards successfully argued last year that the value of its store in Fond du Lac assessed by the city at $9.2 million should be no more than $5.2 million. A similar lawsuit from Target argues that Fond du Lac should reduce its taxes on the retailer by about a third. The dilemma for small cities is that the cost of defending lawsuits can equal or exceed the amount of property tax revenue at play, so they are more inclined to settle than fight it, said Deschane, who’s with the League of Municipalities. Lawmakers in nearby states have had mixed success in tackling the issue. A proposal in Michigan that attempted to require the taxable value to be based on the highest and best use of a property failed to pass last year. But in Indiana, the Republican-controlled Legislature, along with then-Gov. Mike Pence, enacted legislation to block what opponents call a tax loophole. The Wisconsin bill is modeled after the Indiana law. ___ Follow Scott Bauer on Twitter at https://twitter.com/sbauerAP . His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/scott-bauer .

News Sports Entertainment Obits Jobs Cars Homes All Access E-Edition Subscriber Services log in Site Archive The Trump disciple vs. the 'illegals' Sunday Mar 19, 2017 at 9:58 AM This is what divides them at the dawn of the Trump era: for the president to keep his promise to millions of working-class white voters like Estes, he is threatening millions of working-class immigrants like the family next door. The Washington Post · Mary Jordan, Kevin Sullivan VALLEY VIEW, Tex. - At 4:30 a.m. on a windy Monday, Tamara Estes swallows vitamin B12 for energy and krill oil for her arthritic fingers. Even with her nightly Ambien, she is always up before the sun, getting ready for a job that reminds her of what infuriates her about America. She drives a school bus on a route that winds through a North Texas neighborhood filled with undocumented Mexicans. She picks up nearly 100 of their children and drops them off at public schools funded by American taxpayers. By her. One immigrant family lives in the house next door, and in the dark hours before dawn, they are also stirring. As the father leaves for his job at a construction site, the mother is scrambling eggs and scooping them into warm tortillas. They have been working in America for two decades without legal status, but their four children were born here, so they are U.S. citizens - or, as Estes and President Donald Trump call them, "anchor babies." The eldest, Rainier Corral, 15, emerges from his bedroom carrying a book bag and a trumpet case. He's a 188-pound rock of a kid who plays lineman on the high school football team, a top-notch student who wants to study mechanical engineering at Texas A&M. Rainier's family has always believed in the promise of America, where they saved enough to buy their own home and their kids go to good schools. But now that Trump is threatening to deport millions - and even change the law that gave their children U.S. citizenship - they are filled with fear. Estes, meanwhile, is filled with new hope. For years, she has felt she was living the American Dream in reverse, her life sliding backward, in part, she believes, because illegal immigrants take good jobs and drive up her taxes. Now she thinks her life will improve because Trump is promising to "take our country back." This is what divides them at the dawn of the Trump era: for the president to keep his promise to millions of working-class white voters like Estes, he is threatening millions of working-class immigrants like the family next door. - - - It's 20 miles to the school-bus depot and, as Estes drives, she flips on conservative talk radio, where she gets most of her news. She tunes to 660 AM and Mark Davis, a popular Texas talker, who is praising Trump, trashing liberals and making Estes nostalgic for better days. "I wish we could go back to a time when we could live, not just exist, when everything wasn't a struggle," she says. Estes is 59, divorced and earns $24,000 a year. With four days left to payday, she has $118.72 in her checking account. She earns a bit too much to qualify for most government assistance but too little to buy health insurance, with its high monthly premiums and impossible deductibles. When she broke her arm last year, she wrapped it in a $15 drugstore brace and popped ibuprofen for a month. The way she sees it, life is easier for illegal Mexican immigrants than for taxpaying, working-class white Americans. As her life has gotten harder, she believes the fortunes of "illegals" have been rising, and that she's paying for it. Little galls her more than "anchor babies," who are entitled to government benefits, including Medicaid, public schools and food assistance. Estes resents paying for their safety net when she feels she has none. "I can't seem to pull my status back up where it was 20 years ago," she says. "Some of it's my fault. Some of it's not." The United States has been granting "birthright citizenship" to babies born on its soil, regardless of their parents' legal status, since just after the Civil War. Congress and the states adopted the 14th Amendment to the Constitution in 1868, primarily to guarantee citizenship to freed slaves. Over the past three decades, every other developed economy in the world except Canada has abandoned or restricted birthright citizenship amid rising flows of immigrants and refugees. But in America, it remains commonplace. In 2014, 7 percent of all U.S. births - about 275,000 babies - were to parents illegally in the United States, according to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. In Texas, undocumented immigrants accounted for a quarter of all deliveries paid for by Medicaid in 2015 - more than 54,000 babies - according to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. The cost to taxpayers: $116 million. Defenders of birthright citizenship say integrating immigrants is part of what makes the United States exceptional, and that denying these babies citizenship would create a huge new underclass of people living outside the law. Critics say it encourages illegal immigration and drains public resources. Estes was delighted when Trump attacked birthright citizenship during the campaign, saying: "A woman gets pregnant. She's nine months, she walks across the border, she has the baby in the United States, and we take care of the baby for 85 years. I don't think so." Polls show that the vast majority of Americans oppose mass deportations, but Trump's core supporters are solidly for it: According to a recent CNN/Kaiser poll, 55 percent of whites without college degrees said they want everyone living in the country illegally to be deported. Everywhere Estes looks, she's reminded that her country is changing. White enrollment in Texas schools recently dipped below 30 percent. Hispanics are the new majority; Pew estimates that more than 13 percent of Texas students are the children of undocumented parents. Estes wants a better-paying job but says it's hard to get one these days if you speak only English. Increasingly, the first question in any job interview is, "Habla español?" So when Trump started talking about deporting illegal immigrants who "compete directly against vulnerable American workers," Estes went to his rallies and stuck a Trump sign on her lawn. She has come to be known as the "Trump Lady" on her school bus, which on this Monday morning approaches its first rider, a tiny kindergartner bundled in a gray parka and wearing a purple backpack. "Love you!" the little girl says in English to her Spanish-speaking mother. For two hours, Estes picks up dozens of children. They chatter in the seats behind her in Spanish, a language she doesn't understand. She boils inside about her tax dollars paying for their education. But she likes the kids, and she can't afford to lose this job. So she smiles and says, over and over: "Careful on the stairs." "Have a good day, y'all." - - - As Estes heads to work, Rainier is in the kitchen next door, checking his phone for news. "Quieres café?" his mother, Azucena Reyes, 34, asks him, as she stirs eggs on the stove. "No, thanks," he says in English, waving off coffee to check the Young Turks news site on YouTube, where today's headline is: "Trump's Deportation Force Unleashed." Rainier was born four months after Reyes, then 18, entered the United States on a tourist visa hoping to give her child a better life than the one he would have faced in her poor mining town in Durango, Mexico. He has always felt fully American, no different from his white classmates. But now, in this county that voted 83 percent for Trump, he suddenly hears people spitting out: "Go back to your own country," or "Go mow a lawn." Rumors about deportations are flying. Reyes heard from a friend that immigration agents were arresting people at Walmart. Others say it was at a different store. Or at roadblocks. The family stays home more often now but still went to church yesterday, joining 1,400 others at a Spanish-language Catholic Mass. Their pastor says many more are choosing to skip Mass, worried that federal agents might stake out the church. Reyes is worried, too, but said she and her family agreed to be interviewed for this story because they want people to better understand the immigrants who are being threatened with deportation. Amid so much "uncertainty and fear," she says, "I hope we can do some good." What's happening now doesn't seem fair to Rainier. Americans hire the undocumented to build their houses, pick their crops, mow their lawns, wash their dishes. They're happy to take the hard, low-paying jobs nobody else wants. In return, they'd like to live without fear of being deported. Rainier says families like his are being targeted for problems they have not created. "Most of them are just normal people that are trying to get a better way of life," Rainier says. "It's one thing to deport people who have criminal records - that's fine. It's another thing to deport families that haven't done anything wrong." Trump has argued that undocumented immigrants take jobs from American workers, depress wages and overburden government services. Studies have partially confirmed that view, at least in the short term. Last year, an exhaustive study by the respected National Academies of Sciences found that undocumented workers can temporarily depress wages slightly for the lowest category of unskilled jobs. But the study found "little to no negative effects on overall wages and employment of native-born workers in the longer term." The same study said that newly arrived immigrants are a net cost to taxpayers, primarily due to the expense of educating their children. But those children, and their children after them, more than make up for it, contributing far more in taxes to state and local governments than they take in services. Most economists do not blame illegal immigrants for the decline of the U.S. working class. They argue that immigrants boost the nation's fortunes by filling undesirable jobs at low pay, cutting the cost of many goods and services. Rainier's parents have worked for years cleaning homes, working in a glue factory, installing bathroom partitions, nailing baseboards. Four years ago, they pooled their life savings to buy their little house, paying $40,000 in cash at a foreclosure sale. They now pay $1,700 a year in property tax. They file federal returns on income of about $30,000 in a good year, including withholdings for Social Security and Medicare - benefits they are unlikely ever to receive. Nationwide, undocumented immigrants pay about $11.7 billion a year in state and local income, sales and property taxes, including about $1.5 billion in Texas, according to the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. And more than 4 million people who do not have Social Security numbers - most of them undocumented immigrants - file federal tax returns using Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers issued by the Internal Revenue Service. Rainier's family has been trying for two decades to become legal. Since 1997, his father, Nicolas Nevarez, 38, has had an application pending for a resident visa through his father, an undocumented worker granted U.S. citizenship under Ronald Reagan's 1986 amnesty program. Last year, the United States issued only 801 visas in his category - a Mexican married adult child of a U.S. citizen - out of a waiting list of more than 204,000. His lawyer tells him to be patient. "I'm trying to do everything right," Nevarez says. "But 20 years?" Nevarez and Reyes have no health insurance and constantly worry about getting sick, although their children are eligible for Medicaid. When Rainier needed knee surgery last year, it was fully covered. Rainier's parents tell him valora la oportunidad - appreciate the opportunity he has in America - and he does. But he has no idea how he will pay for college, so he is thinking that right after high school he will enlist in the U.S. Army. "It's my country and I want to serve," he says, as he picks up his trumpet case and backpack and heads off to school. - - - After finishing her morning route, Estes parks her yellow school bus and clocks out. It's 9 a.m. Her afternoon shift starts at 2:30. It would take too much gas to drive home and back, so she waits in the parking lot, unpaid, in her Honda Fit. She eats a blueberry muffin out of a plastic bag and listens to the radio, where Mark Davis is praising Trump's first weeks in office. Estes thinks Trump is off to a great start. She wanted to high-five the new president when he said in his inaugural address, "The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer." She says it was as if Trump was speaking directly to her. Estes grew up in Dallas, in a grand home with a built-in pool. She even had her own horse. Her mother died when she was 4, so she lived with her father, a small-business owner who drove a red Thunderbird convertible. Then her father died when she was 19. She quickly married and, by 26, was divorced with two kids. She has worked a lifetime of jobs that have paid less and less. She was a scrub tech at a medical clinic, a courier carrying blueprints for a developer, a shuttle driver for a casino. Years ago, she moved an hour north of Dallas, where she could afford a tiny house on a two-acre plot carved from a vast expanse of wheat fields. Now she is almost 60, raised in upper-middle-class comfort and living in working-class stress. Estes regrets not going to college and becoming a veterinarian. On the radio, she hears that good jobs for people with only a high school diploma have been stolen by globalization and automation: China and robots. She knows that it may take Trump more time to bring those jobs back. But she's thrilled that he is moving on his promise to kick out the "illegals." "They'll be out of here so frickin' fast!" Trump said at a Dallas campaign rally in September 2015, as Estes and 20,000 others cheered. She's also grateful that a president is finally talking about "anchor babies." Most legal scholars say that revoking birthright citizenship would take another constitutional amendment, a complicated process that requires two-thirds approval of both chambers of Congress and ratification by three-quarters of the states. Trump, however, has suggested simply challenging the prevailing interpretation in court. "Some very, very good lawyers" believe children of undocumented immigrants "do not have American citizenship," he said during the campaign. In January, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) reintroduced the Birthright Citizenship Act, which would grant citizenship to an infant only if at least one parent was a U.S. citizen, a lawful permanent resident or a noncitizen serving in the U.S. military. Some Texas officials have pursued a backdoor approach to cutting benefits to the children of undocumented parents by limiting the forms of parental identification they will accept when issuing birth certificates. Without a birth certificate, a child cannot prove citizenship and therefore has no access to government benefits. After Mexican and Central American parents sued in federal court, Texas officials agreed last year to accept more forms of identification, including Mexican voter ID cards - but only after more than 1,000 babies were denied birth certificates, said Jennifer Harbury, an attorney with Texas RioGrande Legal Aid. "The anti-immigrant faction is definitely emboldened," Harbury said. Sitting in her car, Estes switches over to 820 AM, where Rush Limbaugh is singing her tune. "Immigration is the primary reason Donald Trump was elected," he says. "These ICE raids - people are applauding them!" - - - By the time Estes finishes her route and arrives back home, the sun has already set. Her headlights splash across her little house, and her dogs start barking. She breeds Doberman pinschers for extra cash. Minutes later, Nevarez pulls into his driveway. The daily routines are similar in these two small, prefabricated houses on a flat road paved into the North Texas prairie. Both families raise chickens and dogs, work long days for little pay and pray for better at church on Sunday. In four years, the neighbors have barely spoken. Once, Nevarez and some other Mexican immigrants helped Estes dig a grave for one of her dogs. She seemed friendly enough. But then the Trump sign appeared on her lawn, and the distance between them grew. At the kitchen table, Rainier, fresh from track practice, devours four enchiladas. His father eats a few bites. He's tired and doesn't say much. He spent the day on a 30-foot ladder, hanging shutters on houses. His hair is flecked with sawdust. Next door, Estes is in her kitchen, too tired to cook. Sometimes she eats a few cheese cubes after her evening chores. But when she checks the fridge, there are none left. She sinks into her recliner. She says her opposition to "illegals" isn't personal. When she needs help around the house, she says, her Hispanic neighbors offer before "my white neighbors do." She doesn't want the kids on her bus to think she is heartless for supporting deportation raids. But she says something has to change. She flips on the TV. She has recorded eight hours of inauguration coverage on C-SPAN and a two-hour History Channel documentary on Trump, which she now starts watching. "They are losers! They are babies!" Trump is shouting. She laughs. He sure is entertaining. Trump's booming voice fills her small house: "The working class is going to strike back!" "Yes," Estes says. "Yes!"

Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website one  +   =  9 Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Money manager Bill Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square once boasted extraordinary returns. For instance, in 2014, the fund beat out the S&P 500 by a whopping 27%, with 40% gains. However, Pershing Square's returns are not what they use to be… Last year, the fund posted a negative return of 13.5%; in 2015, it returned negative 20.5%, significantly underperforming markets two years in a row. In fact, since the end of 2012, Pershing has returned 5.7% to investors, while the S&P 500 has skyrocketed 67.4%. Majorly contributing to Pershing's recent sagging returns is that three of Ackman's worst trades ever all happened over the past two years… Bill Ackman's Biggest Blunder No. 3: Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT) In 2007, Ackman set up Pershing Square IV, a single-stock fund that invested $2 billion in Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT) call options and other derivatives that year. The fund ended up losing 90% of that money after TGT shares plummeted 50% in 2009. At the time, Target's "expect more, pay less" slogan became half irrelevant as consumers began to shy away from the retailer in favor of Wal-Mart, which was cheaper and offered a wider food selection. In May 2009, Ackman said that Target's board was too "cozy" and "insular," and it lacked members with requisite retailing, credit card, and real estate backgrounds. In a letter to shareholders, Ackman said Target "has substantially underperformed its potential" due to the board. Don't Miss: Secret testing in New Mexico ghost town set to unleash $127 billion in new wealth. Read more… Ackman, who owned a 3% stake (24.8 million shares), fought to get on the board along with four other handpicked members. After months of public accusations on both sides, shareholders voted for board appointments on June 3, 2009. All incumbent directors were re-elected with at least 70% of the vote… In other words, Ackman's months-long campaign to take over fell flat as he and his hand-selected crew failed to make it on the board. Following the defeat, Ackman sold out of Target at an enormous loss. Shares traded at $70.14 before he first reported his stake; they closed at $51.52 when he announced he had sold his last share. Bill Ackman's Biggest Blunder No. 2: Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE: HLF) Who Is Bill Ackman? Bill Ackman: Fifty-year-old Ackman’s career began in 1992 when he and fellow Harvard graduate David P. Berkowtiz founded the investment firm Gotham Partners. The firm’s high-profile bid for Rockefeller Center in New York caused investors to flock to the firm, growing it to $500 million in assets. Then in 2004, with $54 million in personal funding, Ackman started Pershing Square Capital Management. Through Pershing, Ackman bought significant shares in companies like Wendy’s Co. (Nasdaq: WEN), Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT), Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (NYSE: CMG), and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (NYSE: VRX). Today, Ackman is worth $1.4 billion and is No. 256 on the Forbes 400. Since May 2012, Ackman has maintained that Herbalife Ltd.'s (NYSE: HLF) business structure resembles a pyramid scheme and the company is destined for a major collapse. Later that year, on Dec. 19, news broke on CNBC that Ackman had taken a massive $1 billion short position against Herbalife. Two years later, it looked as though Ackman's bet was going to pay off… In 2014, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) opened a probe into Herbalife's business model on Ackman's allegations the company operated like a pyramid scheme. Must Read: What is a Ponzi scheme? Click here for our infographic… But after two years of investigations, the FTC did not find that Herbalife was acting as a pyramid scheme. The determination sent HLF shares up sharply by 18% on July 15, 2016 — the day of the FTC announcement. Fortune estimated on Jan. 30, 2017, that Ackman may have shorted more than 20 million shares of Herbalife stock. Its calculations suggest Ackman may have lost about $500 million on his short bet. However, $500 million lost on a short gone wrong will look like chump change compared to Ackman's next bet, which may go down as one of the worst in Wall Street history… Join the conversation.

Enter to win – Sugar Sand VIP Getaway! News Markeith Loyd News Special prosecutor Brad King weighing evidence in Markeith Loyd case State Attorney Ayala's stance against the death penalty continues to have an impact - Orlando News Now The day after State Attorney Aramis Ayala revealed she would not seek the death penalty for Markeith Loyd or anyone else, the impact of this decision continues to be discussed across many cases. The day after State Attorney Aramis Ayala revealed she would not seek the death penalty for Markeith Loyd or anyone else, the impact of this decision continues to be discussed across many cases. Rene Stutzman and Gal Tziperman LotanContact ReportersOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy Special prosecutor Brad King said Friday that he has not yet decided whether to seek the death penalty against accused Orlando cop killer Markeith Loyd. On Thursday, Gov. Rick Scott took that case away from Orange-Osceola State Attorney Aramis Ayala hours after she announced that she would not seek the death penalty against Loyd or anyone else. After Scott signed that executive order, handing the case to King, Ayala said she would cooperate fully with the hand-off. I make every decision in my circuit whether we seek the death penalty or not. ... I don’t have all of the facts yet to make a full decision. — Special prosecutor and Fifth Circuit State's Attorney Brad King And she has, King said. He talked to her chief assistant, Deborah Barra, Friday morning. “They have been fully cooperative and gracious and willing to do whatever they can do to help the transition work smoothly,” he said. King, a longtime advocate of the death penalty, is the elected state attorney in the Fifth Judicial Circuit, which includes Lake County. An Orange County grand jury indicted Loyd in two murder cases: that of Orlando Police Lt. Debra Clayton and that of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon. King said he and his chief deputy, Ric Ridgway, would handle both. He has not yet decided whether to seek the death penalty in the Clayton or Dixon cases, he said. That’s because he has not been able to review the evidence and determine whether there are enough “aggravating” factors to prompt a jury to recommend it. “I’ll tell you how I proceed … I sit with the homicide prosecutors assigned to the case,” King said. “We go over the facts as they relate to those aggravating factors that are set forth in the statute. We determine if any or how many of those can be proven … That’s how I will do it. I don’t have all of the facts yet to make a full decision.” Police say Loyd shot and killed Clayton Jan. 9 in a Wal-Mart parking lot. He is also accused of murdering Dixon at her Orange County home on Dec. 13. A spokesman for Gov. Rick Scott did not say Friday whether he would appoint King or anyone else to handle other murder cases in which he favored the death penalty in Orange and Osceola counties. King said Scott had not discussed that possibility with him. “I will do as I am asked,” he said It was not clear Friday what would happen to Orange and Osceola County death penalty cases in which an appeals court throws out the sentence. There are at least 10 defendants for whom that is likely to happen. They are in addition to six murder cases that have not yet come to trial in which Ayala’s office had earlier said she would seek the death penalty. If Ayala follows through with her pledge, their sentences will be reduced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Typically, the state attorney would prepare for a new sentencing hearing and ask a new jury to recommend the death penalty. Those convicted killers include John Huggins, convicted of murdering Carla Larson, an engineer who was abducted from a Publix near Walt Disney World in 1997, and strangled; and Jermaine “Bugsy” Lebron, convicted of murdering a 22-year-old Belle Isle man in Osceola County in 1995 so he could steal the man’s red pickup. Attorney General Pam Bondi handles death row appeals for all 20 of Florida’s state attorneys. Bondi’s press secretary, Kylie Mason, gave no indication Friday what Bondi would do now about those 10 cases. The other 19 state attorneys on Friday told The News Service of Florida that they will seek the death penalty in appropriate cases. King, 59, of Ocala, is likely best remembered by Orando-area residents as the special prosecutor who in 2005 convinced an Orange County grand jury to indict Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer on charges related to voter fraud, then six weeks later dropped the charges, saying they were unfounded. He’s a former Marion County deputy who has served as state attorney for 28 years. King was lead prosecutor in the case of Richard Henyard, who was executed seven years ago for abducting Dorothy Reid Lewis from a Winn-Dixie store in Eustis where she and her two daughters had gone shopping in 1993. Henyard fatally shot Lewis’ 3- and 6-year-old daughters then raped and shot Reid and left her for dead. King sought and won the death penalty although Lewis opposed it. He also was the lead prosecutor in the case of vampire murderer Rod Ferrell, who in 1996, when he was 16, shot and killed a Eustis couple then fled to Louisiana with their daughter. Ferrell is serving a life sentence. King said he had no concerns about Loyd’s bizarre courtroom behavior. Since his arrest Jan. 17, Loyd has, at times, refused to enter the courtroom; gone on long, profane rants; refused to enter a plea and refused the appointment of an attorney. “There are cases that outline what’s appropriate and how to deal with those kinds of people,” King said. “I assume the judge will just follow the law and do what needs to be done.” Loyd is to appear in court Monday before Chief Judge Frederick Lauten for a status hearing. King indicated he or a co-worker would be there and pick up the case file from Ayala’s staff then. rstutzman@orlandosentinel.com, glotan@orlandosentinel.com Caption Governor Rick Scott on removing Aramis Ayala from Markeith Loyd's case Governor Rick Scott talks about his decision to remove Aramis Ayala from Markeith Loyd's case.

Idaho Business Health Nation World Elections Photos Business Front & Center: The long and fulfilling days of Addison Pemberton, president of Liberty Lake manufacturer Scanivalve SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 2017, 5 A.M. By Michael Guilfoil For The Spokesman-Review Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Five facts Business started: 1955 Employees: 42 Products: intelligent pressure and temperature scanning equipment for aerospace research and development Clients: Pratt & Whitney, General Electric, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Honeywell More information: www.scanivalve.com, (509) 891-9970 Addison Pemberton keeps one foot firmly in the future, the other planted in the past. By day he is president and co-owner of Scanivalve, a Liberty Lake manufacturer of sophisticated pressure instrumentation used in wind tunnels to measure the aerodynamics of aircraft, cars, bridges and skyscrapers. At night, he and a cohort of volunteers painstakingly restore vintage airplanes, including an iconic 1942 twin-engine Grumman Goose that hasn’t flown in decades … but may next month. During a recent interview at one of his two Felts Field hangars, Pemberton discussed dropping out of college, ice cream and how he got the name Addison. S-R: Where did you grow up? Pemberton: San Diego. S-R: What was your favorite class in high school? Pemberton: Physics. S-R: How about extracurricular activities? Pemberton: When not at school, I spent all my waking hours either learning to fly or working at Scanivalve, my parents’ business. I started doing machine work there with my brother when I was 12. By high school I was making three bucks an hour – enough to buy all the aviation gas I could burn. S-R: Did you assume you’d go into the family business? Pemberton: I did. My dad and I spent hours in the lab together and really bonded. S-R: What’s one lesson that stuck? Pemberton: Any technical or life problem you have, you can approach someone of consequence. For instance, when we read about (Paul) MacCready’s human-powered Gossamer Albatross in Popular Science we were fascinated, and my dad said, “Let’s call this guy. He lives in Bakersfield.” So we called him up, flew to Bakersfield the next weekend, and became lifelong friends. Another time we contacted an inventor in Germany, went to visit him, and his son ended up living with us for a year. Try to get the best gunfighter you can get, because they’re usually approachable. S-R: Are you the best gunfighter for somebody? Pemberton: Everybody has their niche, including me. One of the biggest privileges I have at Scanivalve is the technical interchange with customers. Quite often I’ll send them to a competitor, because they’re trying to overbuy. My stuff is very fast and accurate but expensive, and all they need is a Walmart-type solution. S-R: Where did you go to college? Pemberton: Initially two private Christian schools, and ended up at San Diego State. But I never graduated. I was 24 and one semester shy of a degree in mechanical engineering when Scanivalve found itself in a desperate state. We were transitioning from a smoky machine shop to an electronic company, I was working 80 hours a week, and suddenly our machine shop manager quit. My parents were overseas, so I left school to help run the business with my brother Jim. Those were crazy years. S-R: Is he still involved? Pemberton: Yes, we’re co-owners and business partners. Jim is the money guy, and I’m the technical guy. S-R: Besides morphing from analog to digital, how has the company evolved during the past 35 years? Pemberton: We’ve grown. We had 90 people at one time, but were very labor-intensive. Today we have eight CNC machine centers, each doing the work of 10 people. We farm more stuff out than we ever did, because we don’t want to be over 50 people. Annual revenue is around $7 million. S-R: What have been some best and worst times? Pemberton: The early ’80s were the worst. What saved our necks was being able to store-buy a PC in 1985 that would interface with my analog equipment. S-R: And the best time? Pemberton: The ’90s. Digital turned out to be quite lucrative. Then 9/11 hit us hard. The aerospace market evaporated for about two years. But that pushed us into wind engineering – the aerodynamic study of buildings and bridges – and turbine performance testing for power plants. S-R: How about today? Pemberton: These are trying times for small businesses. We do more paperwork than we ever did. S-R: How many other manufactures do what you do? Pemberton: Two. One in Virginia and one in Massachusetts. S-R: Why did you relocate your company from San Diego to Spokane in 1995? Pemberton: I wanted to leave California, which had become very restrictive and expensive, with too many dang people. S-R: Why did you choose Spokane? Pemberton: We could have been anywhere in the world. We looked at six small West Coast cities, including Bend, Oregon. We wanted to live where it was pretty, and Spokane offered the infrastructure we needed. I’d been here repeatedly in the late ’70s, because when I was in college I ferried airplanes to Alaska every summer, and the weather was always better on this side of the Cascades. S-R: What’s a typical day for you? Pemberton: I start my morning at 8, meeting with all my engineers to set priorities. Then I spend most of the day responding to emails – drafting quotes, providing technical support – or talking on the phone. People today expect instant answers. By late afternoon, things usually slow down enough that I can get out on the production floor and look at stuff. Then I come to the hangar, where my wife has dinner prepared, and we spend the evening restoring vintage aircraft. When I get home around 11:30 or midnight, I read all my new emails so I know what I’m going to get hit with the next morning – problems or orders from all over the world. S-R: What do you like most about your job? Pemberton: The people I work with. S-R: What do you like least? Pemberton: Government bureaucracy. S-R: What’s been the biggest surprise? Pemberton: That we’ve been able to keep reinventing ourselves and stay competitive. S-R: How do you market your testing equipment? Pemberton: Web, trade shows, some magazines, and I have 13 international distributors. But a lot of it is word of mouth – Scanivalve is the Frigidaire of high-speed pressure instrumentation. S-R: What qualities do you look for in job candidates? Pemberton: Whether their hobbies are technical. Do they work on their own car? What projects did they enjoy in college? I’ve been very impressed with the quality of candidates we’re getting from Eastern – particularly someone who gets his degree when he’s married, has kids and is holding down a full-time job. That guy has hustle. S-R: Do you have many women applicants? Pemberton: Not for engineering positions. But I work with lot of women in this industry who are very, very capable. S-R: When did your passion for vintage airplanes begin? Pemberton: I’ve enjoyed aircraft since I was little. My dad bought an airplane when I was 8. That plane was 21 years old, but airplanes last forever. I have seven – from a Piper Super Cub to the Grumman Goose – and the newest one was built in 1961. S-R: Where did you get the amphibious Goose? Pemberton: From the Palm Springs Air Museum. It was never going to fly again. But after putting 8,000 hours into restoration, we hope to fly it next month. Most pilots would agree it’s one of the coolest airplanes ever built. S-R: What appeals to you about restoring vintage aircraft? Pemberton: The technology, and the diversity of character. If you go to a parking lot today, you can’t tell a Rav 4 from a Rogue – they all look the same. But every one of these airplanes has a very distinct character. S-R: When you finish restoring a vintage plane, is it a shell surrounding modern technology, or an old aircraft with a few upgrades? Pemberton: Structurally it’s accurate. The engines are later dash numbers, and we use newer avionics and alternators and backup power. But they fly just like they did. They’re still a piece of history. I have a Model 40 – the oldest functioning Boeing of any kind in the world. When I flew it around the country, some people drove 300 miles to see it. S-R: How many flight hours have you logged? Pemberton: More than 12,000. S-R: Have you ever crashed? Pemberton: No. I’ve had engines quit and ended up in a field, but I’ve never destroyed an airplane. S-R: You work from 8 in the morning to midnight. That sounds like two full-time jobs. Pemberton: And I’ve been doing it for 40 years. But it beats going home and sitting in front of the television. S-R: What’s atop your bucket list? Pemberton: I want to take the Goose to the Arctic Circle, and teach my five grandkids to fly. S-R: Do you have a secret talent? Pemberton: I have a knack for organizing people. S-R: Any guilty pleasures? Pemberton: Ice cream is my biggest vice. S-R: What would you change about yourself? Pemberton: I’d lose 30 pounds. S-R: How do you relax? Pemberton: Restoring vintage aircraft. The thing about Scanivalve is that the challenges are rewarding, but slow coming – it takes years to develop something. At the hangar, I can bend a piece of metal, reproduce a part, and I feel like I’ve accomplished something. Instant reward at night, long-time reward at Scanivalve. S-R: By the way, what’s the story behind your name? Pemberton: I tell people my mother couldn’t think of what to call me, so when she added a son to the family, she called me “Addison.” But actually I’m named after my grandfather.

A recent federal change, however, could delay newcomers. In Coudersport, Pennsylvania, a town in a mountainous region an hour’s drive from the nearest Wal-Mart, Cole Memorial Hospital counts on two Jordanian physicians to keep its obstetrics unit open and is actively recruiting foreign specialists. In Fargo, North Dakota, a gastroenterologist from Lebanon — who is among thousands of foreign physicians in the state — has risen to become vice president of the North Dakota Medical Association. In Great Falls, Montana, 60 percent of the doctors who specialize in hospital care at Benefis Health System, which serves about 230,000 people in 15 counties, are foreign doctors on work visas. Small-town America relies on a steady flow of doctors from around the world. But a recent decision by the government to alter the timetable for some visa applications is likely to delay the arrival of new foreign doctors, and is causing concern in the places that depend on them. While the Trump administration is fighting for its temporary travel ban affecting six countries, the slowdown in the rural doctor pipeline shows how even a small change can ripple throughout the country. In Montana, for example, where nine counties do not have a single physician, it means Benefis Health does not know when a Romanian doctor trained in kidney transplants will arrive. The health care company spent months recruiting the doctor and had been expecting her in July. The procedural change regards temporary visas for skilled workers, known as H-1B visas. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services recently announced that it would temporarily suspend a “premium processing” option by which employers could pay an extra $1,225 to have H-1B applications approved in as little as two weeks, rather than several months. Companies using that option, the government said, have effectively delayed visas for others that did not pay the extra fee. A spokeswoman for the immigration agency, Arwen Consaul, said in a statement that the measure was necessary to “work down the existing backlogs due to the high volume of incoming petitions.” The immigration agency said in a statement that applicants could still request an H-1B approval on an “expedited basis,” if they could prove there was an emergency or humanitarian justification. Immigration lawyers said that it was extremely difficult to meet that standard, and that they doubted whether the agency could handle a flood of such requests.

March 19, 2017 1:01 AM Costco finds bright spot: Booze Wholesale club missed analysts' profit projections Molly Smith | Bloomberg The holidays didn’t go well for Costco Wholesale, whose profit during the period missed analysts’ projections by the most in at least a decade. But there was something to raise a glass to: booze. Alcohol sales have surged at the warehouse-club chain, lifted in part by the cult status of Costco’s Kirkland Signature-branded liquors. Many customers swear by the private-label products, and some are even convinced that the spirits are actually top-shelf liquors such as Grey Goose and Tanqueray hidden behind Costco packaging. That’s helped set Costco’s beverages apart from other private-label fare, said David Schick, lead retail analyst at Consumer Edge Research. “They use very high-end producers – premium all the way up to super-premium and beyond,” he said. Alcohol brought in $3.8 billion for Costco in its latest fiscal year, with wine sales accounting for almost half of the total. The category has grown 46 percent during the past five years, outpacing the company’s broader food and sundries segment, according to Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti. Kirkland Signature has been key to its success. The retailer began selling wine under the brand in 2003, followed by spirits in 2007. It also has a line of craft beers. Emphasizing private-label products has lowered Costco’s average retail prices, but surging demand has offset that impact on sales, Galanti said. “Private label continues to grow as a dominant strategy in retail – especially when it migrates from being a ‘label’ to more of a ‘brand,’ which Kirkland has done,” said David Bassuk, managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners in New York. “Now it’s a well-known name and gives the consumer a perception of value and a good deal.” The sources of the beverages remain a mystery. Kirkland Signature items are produced by “various manufacturers,” said Annette Alvarez-Peters, who manages Costco’s beverage alcohol division, without naming providers. Schick and other analysts calculate that Costco’s markup on its alcohol is in the range of 10 percent to 14 percent – extremely low by industry standards. In contrast, most retail liquor stores add from 25 percent to as much as 45 percent, especially for premium items, according to Schick. “They’re doing the opposite of looking to cut corners,” he said. “They’re looking for maximum quality and minimum markup to drive value for the member.” It’s a bright spot at a challenging time for Costco. The company posted earnings of $1.17 a share last quarter, far short of analysts’ projections for $1.36. Industrywide food deflation and higher gas prices have brought a double-whammy to the retailer. Gross margin, another closely followed benchmark, missed estimates by the most in more than four years. Even a highly anticipated membership fee increase did little to placate investors, with the shares tumbling after the results were released. Of Costco’s 508 locations in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, it can sell beer and wine in more than 80 percent of them, according to Alvarez-Peters. Hard alcohol is less common, due to tougher local restrictions. About 60 percent of the stores offer spirits. By comparison, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world’s largest retailer, sells wine and/or spirits in about two-thirds of its 4,700 stores. While Wal-Mart doesn’t break out those sales in its quarterly results, Piper Jaffray Cos. senior retail analyst Sean Naughton said he’d be surprised if Costco wasn’t the leader. “They’re taking share away from everyone because they can offer the lowest price.” Other retailers and grocers are trying to mimic Costco’s success. In 2003, Target Corp. introduced a private label – Target Wine Cube – to tap into premium boxed wines, and it’s currently exploring private label opportunities in other alcohol categories. Adult beverage was the fastest-growing division at the company last year. Whole Foods Market Inc. launched its Criterion Collection wines in 2015 and now has 10 varieties of reds and whites. To boost the brand, the company brought Devon Broglie on as a global beverage buyer. He is one of 236 experts around the globe with the designation of “master sommelier.” While alcohol laws vary by state, Issaquah, Washington-based Costco has faced some of its toughest liquor legal battles in its own backyard. The retailer was the largest backer of an almost $23 million initiative to privatize Washington state liquor stores in 2011. That ballot measure succeeded, after revisions were made to a previous initiative that failed, and inspired grocers in other states to oppose state-run alcohol sales. “There’s a lot of politics involved for each state,” Naughton said. Even so, “there’s a very consistent demand that doesn’t fluctuate that much as we believe alcohol is a nondiscretionary purchase for many consumers – regardless of economic conditions.” With an average of 250 items across the three alcoholic beverage categories, Costco is selective in what it chooses to stock. It rotates items in and out of the system in what it calls a treasure hunt. “With the limited-item assortment, we constantly evaluate,” Alvarez-Peters said. “Every item must perform in volume.” The treasure hunt – along with the economics of bulk buying – are what keeps Costco members happy, Schick said. “When they buy something, they buy a lot,” he said. “This becomes quite powerful in alcohol.” Email to a Friend Obituaries Newspaper subscription information Newspaper circulation (260-461-8519) Send news tips 24-hour tip line (260) 466-NEWS Sign up for free daily newsletter Copyright © 2017, www.journalgazette.net 600 W.

The Edwardsville Little Tigers football club is helping to coordinate collection efforts for the Campbell children and their caregivers. Elizabeth Donald/BND Edwardsville Little Tigers president Eddie Lowry supervises the volunteers sorting the latest collection of donations for the Campbell children. The Little Tigers’ collections alone have filled four storage units and a 22-foot box trailer, with more coming in, Lowry said.

The community has rallied to support the Campbell children, who lost their parents and their home on Thursday morning. Elizabeth Donald/BND When the donations bins at the Glen Carbon Wal-mart fill up, the store sets up shopping carts for the overflow - at times as many as ten carts’ full stretching down the aisle. The Edwardsville-Glen Carbon community has rallied to support the seven Campbell children who were orphaned and lost their home early Thursday morning. Elizabeth Donald/BND 1 of 6 i By Elizabeth Donald edonald@bnd.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The Friday night lights behind Edwardsville High School illuminated a line of cars that stretched across the campus to the road on the far side of the school. The cars were bringing donations to the Edwardsville Little Tigers’ collection effort for the Campbell children. The outpouring of donations and support has been “overwhelming,” according to the organizers with the children’s football club. All but the two youngest Campbell children participated in Little Tigers either as football players or cheerleaders, according to Little Tigers president Eddie Lowry. “We know the kids,” Lowry said. “We’re a part of these kids’ lives, and we want to teach them that we’re behind them.” So when word spread about the tragedy that had befallen the seven Campbell children — their father shot in their home, their mother dead in a nearby lake, the youngest sibling nearly drowned, their house burned and all their belongings gone — the Edwardsville-Glen Carbon community swung into gear. “We had a lot of tears as people were coming up, but we had a lot of people who were thankful to be able to help these kids,” Lowry said. On Friday night, the line of cars waiting to donate toys, clothing, housewares and more was daunting. The student football players ran up and down the line, collecting the donations from each car in carts in order to keep the line moving, Lowry said. “The generosity has been overwhelming,” Lowry said. “The message to the community is, ‘Thank you.’ It’s been amazing how generous they are, and the family is so appreciative. They’re a little overwhelmed right now, but they are so appreciative.” Metro-East Mini Storage offered three storage units for donations, Lowry said. As of Saturday afternoon, they are full, as well as another storage unit they had acquired. A 22-foot box trailer loaned to the effort was expected to be full by the end of Saturday’s collection, he said. And that doesn’t include the large bins at the Glen Carbon Wal-Mart, located at each entrance. Co-manager Courtnie Howes said that when the bins fill up, they line up shopping carts in the aisle to hold the extra. As many as 10 shopping carts were filled at one point, Howes said, with more bins and carts filling up Saturday afternoon. “We have a lot of stuff,” Lowry said. “All of it is being shown and offered to the caregivers so the kids have what they need.” And the Little Tigers aren’t the only ones collecting: ▪ The Country Meadows Homeowners Association and Edwardsville Wrestling Club have been collecting items and donations for the family and coordinating their efforts with the Little Tigers. A Campbell family fundraiser will take place at Edison’s Entertainment Complex 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. March 25, with $16 unlimited bowling, laser tag and arcade to benefit the family, according to Facebook posts on the homeowners’ association page. ▪ The Edwardsville Orchestra Boosters learned that one of the children was involved in orchestra, and had lost her viola to the fire. Within hours, two violas were donated, as well as a music stand and other equipment to ensure she could continue playing in the orchestra. ▪ Edwardsville District 7 schools are coordinating donations through the director of student services, with what Superintendent Lynda Andre described in a parent letter as “numerous donations … of clothing and shoes, school supplies, bedding and other hygiene items.” ▪ Kids Club Child Development Center will be collecting gift card donations through March 24 for the Campbell family. ▪ At least three GoFundMe campaigns were set up, but the one sanctioned by the family is being coordinated by David Fellows, a retired police officer who served with the Fairview Heights Police Department for 26 years and currently works for Illinois Law Enforcement Alarm System. Fellows said he knew the family through a cousin, and offered his assistance in running a GoFundMe campaign that had raised nearly $6,000 by Saturday evening. “It looks like it’s starting to get some traction,” Fellows said. Fellows said the children’s grandmother will be the one to access the account, and it will all go to the children. Of the two other campaigns, Fellows said one has already shut down and combined its proceeds with his; the other has not replied to questions from the family as yet. Donations haven’t just been clothing, games and stuffed animals, Lowry said. Everything from dental care to counseling services have been offered free to the children, to help them through their tragedy. Lowry said they have already taken a first round of donations to the children. Each child has received a bicycle and tablet, he said. Someone has donated new bunk beds to the family, so the children have sufficient beds and bedding, as well as clothes, toys, shoes, backpacks and more. “We didn’t want to overwhelm the caregivers,” Lowry said. “There’s a lot to sort through, and we’re doing it right now.” In fact, there’s been so much donated that the organizers are calling for a change of focus. “They don’t need any more things now,” Lowry said. “I think what they’re most concerned about is the ongoing needs of the kids, so probably financial contributions are better at this point.” The Little Tigers has set up its own collection fund, which Lowry said would not be subject to any fees and 100 percent will go directly to the kids. He did not have an exact figure as of Saturday, because money keeps coming in, he said. But it is already into the “tens of thousands,” he said. They have not set a donation goal, Lowry said, because all the money collected will be put into a trust fund for the children to help fund their care and future college educations. Lowry said he was both surprised and not surprised by the reaction of the Edwardsville-Glen Carbon community. “The community has just come together for these kids, and it’s just amazing,” he said. “I wish I could say I was really surprised, because I’m not — this is a great place to be. And people have just kicked in like you can’t believe … Is it overwhelming for us? Sure, it’s overwhelming, but it’s a great overwhelming.” At this point, there has been much more collected than the children or their caregivers could possibly take, Lowry said. What will happen to the rest? “We haven’t decided yet,” Lowry said, laughing. “We will obviously do something so the family can benefit from that, but we haven’t figured out what that will be yet.” Nothing will be thrown away, he said, but they will find a solution that further benefits the Campbell children. Meanwhile, the children are doing as well as can be expected, while the caregivers are a bit overwhelmed, Lowry said. He has not discussed the tragedy with the children, but instead he said they are focusing on the future — and on their new belongings for their new life, he said. On Saturday, Lowry brought over the bicycles and the children leaped to them, riding around in the cool sunshine. “They came running out of the place where they are staying and went riding around the cul-de-sac, and it was just awesome, because they were able to get some energy out and focus on something else,” Lowry said. In the meantime, volunteers continue to sort the massive donations at the Tigers’ clubhouse, and Lowry said the Little Tigers “family” will continue to work as long as the kids need help.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) New York — Chelsea Clinton is joining the board of directors of online travel booking site Expedia. Documents filed with securities regulators say the daughter of defeated U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has joined its 14-member board. The company is controlled by Barry Diller. Chelsea Clinton is also a director of another company that Diller controls, IAC/InterActiveCorp. Expedia did not disclose how much she would be paid, but non-employee directors each earned more than $250,000 in 2015, according to the most recent regulatory filings. Filings for IAC say Chelsea Clinton is entitled to receive $300,000 in a mix of stock and cash each year for serving as a director. The Expedia filing on Friday came a day after publishers Penguin Young Readers announced it will publish a children's book by Chelsea Clinton on May 30. The book is called "She Persisted." In the book, Clinton will honor 13 American women "who never take no for an answer," including Harriet Tubman, Sonia Sotomayor and Oprah Winfrey. U.S. temporarily bans larger electronics from cabins of certain flights Published: Tuesday, March 21, 2017 @ 3:07 AM By: Patrick McMahon, Rare.us Woman typing on laptop computer in commercial airplane (Jason Dewey / The Image Bank / Getty Images)(Jason Dewey/Getty Images) Jason Dewey/Getty Images A temporary ban on carry-on electronics is set to take effect Tuesday on certain flights into the U.S., according to reporting from The Hill and supported by tweets posted by Royal Jordanian Airlines. Those tweets have since been deleted but read, “Following instructions from the concerned U.S. departments, we kindly inform our dearest passengers departing to and arriving from the United States that carrying any electronic or electrical device on board the flight cabins is strictly prohibited,” according to The Hill. >> Read more trending news The ban will be formally announced Tuesday but is said to affect 13 countries for the next 96 hours and is a response to a specific intelligence threat, The Hill reported, citing Fox News. The ban reportedly has nothing to do with President Donald Trump’s travel ban, two versions of which have now been struck down by courts across the country. Affected countries, airlines and flights are in the process of being informed, CNN reported. The ban reportedly applies to all electronics except mobile phones and medical devices; items such as laptops, tablets and cameras may not be brought into the cabin but can fly in checked luggage. White House promotes satirical article praising Trump's new budget Published: Sunday, March 19, 2017 @ 2:34 AM By: Elizabeth Vale, Rare.us Talk about "fake news.”  The White House reportedly shared a story Friday that was written as satire.  This was in today's email from the White House. So clearly, literally no one read the linked piece by @petridishes, did they? pic.twitter.com/1cqoDbqgTg— Molly Templeton (@mollytempleton) March 17, 2017 According to the Daily Beast, a newsletter sent by President Donald Trump's administration featured a story by Washington Post columnist Alexandra Petri and headlined, “Trump’s budget makes perfect sense and will fix America, and I will tell you why.” >> Read more trending stories The column was labeled ComPost, so it’s unclear how the Trump administration staff took the article – which featured lines like “AMERICA WILL BE STRONGER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN!” (her emphasis) – seriously.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)(Evan Vucci/AP) Evan Vucci/AP Petri issued a comment to the Daily Beast, telling the publication, “I am honored to finally be real, true news, which is all I’ve ever striven for.” She added: “It goes to show that as long as you confirm what the Trump White House wants to believe, you, too, can be cited in an email – and you can even work for the mainstream media and do it!”  The columnist concluded her correspondence with the publication by saying that she “can’t stop laughing.” Petri also wrote a follow-up story for The Washington Post. In that story, “How the White House made me Real News,” she came to the conclusion that either White House officials “read it and loved it, especially the part where I wrote that all schoolchildren will be taught by an F-35 in a Make America Great Again hat, or they … did not read it but liked the headline.” The White House has yet to comment on the presumed mistake.

Officials, who closed nearby streets, did not say whether he actually had a bomb, CNN reported. #BREAKING A car drove up to a White House checkpoint- driver claimed to have a bomb.

Trump fires off tweets slamming Russia allegations Published: Monday, March 20, 2017 @ 8:32 AM By: Hélène Vincent, Rare.us President Donald Trump fired off some angry tweets Monday morning regarding allegations that his campaign colluded with the Russian government during the 2016 election. >> Read more trending news The president defended himself and his campaign by reasserting that he has never colluded with Russia — not during his presidential bid and not after the election.

Even with her nightly Ambien, she is always up before the sun, getting ready for a job that reminds her of what infuriates her about America. She drives a school bus on a route that winds through a North Texas neighborhood filled with undocumented Mexicans. She picks up nearly 100 of their children and drops them off at public schools funded by American taxpayers. By her. One immigrant family lives in the house next door, and in the dark hours before dawn, they are also stirring. As the father leaves for his job at a construction site, the mother is scrambling eggs and scooping them into warm tortillas. They have been working in America for two decades without legal status, but their four children were born here, so they are U.S. citizens — or, as Estes and President Trump call them, “anchor babies.” The eldest, Rainier Corral, 15, emerges from his bedroom carrying a book bag and a trumpet case. He’s a 188-pound rock of a kid who plays lineman on the high school football team, a top-notch student who wants to study mechanical engineering at Texas A&M. Rainier’s family has always believed in the promise of America, where they saved enough to buy their own home and their kids go to good schools. But now that Trump is threatening to deport millions — and even change the law that gave their children U.S. citizenship — they are filled with fear. Estes chats with Karisa Bean at Grace Bible Church in Sanger, Tex., on Feb. 19. Estes strongly backs President Trump’s deportation drive. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) Estes, meanwhile, is filled with new hope. For years, she has felt she was living the American Dream in reverse, her life sliding backward, in part, she believes, because illegal immigrants take good jobs and drive up her taxes. Now she thinks her life will improve because Trump is promising to “take our country back.” This is what divides them at the dawn of the Trump era: for the president to keep his promise to millions of working-class white voters like Estes, he is threatening millions of working-class immigrants like the family next door. ‘Anchor babies’ It’s 20 miles to the school-bus depot and, as Estes drives, she flips on conservative talk radio, where she gets most of her news. She tunes to 660 AM and Mark Davis, a popular Texas talker, who is praising Trump, trashing liberals and making Estes nostalgic for better days. “I wish we could go back to a time when we could live, not just exist, when everything wasn’t a struggle,” she says. Estes is 59, divorced and earns $24,000 a year. With four days left to payday, she has $118.72 in her checking account. She earns a bit too much to qualify for most government assistance but too little to buy health insurance, with its high monthly premiums and impossible deductibles. When she broke her arm last year, she wrapped it in a $15 drugstore brace and popped ibuprofen for a month. The way she sees it, life is easier for illegal Mexican immigrants than for taxpaying, working-class white Americans. As her life has gotten harder, she believes the fortunes of “illegals” have been rising, and that she’s paying for it. Little galls her more than “anchor babies,” who are entitled to government benefits, including Medicaid, public schools and food assistance. Estes resents paying for their safety net when she feels she has none. “I can’t seem to pull my status back up where it was 20 years ago,” she says. “Some of it’s my fault. Some of it’s not.” From her home, Estes can see a U.S.-born child of the undocumented couple next door washing his family’s SUV. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) The United States has been granting “birthright citizenship” to babies born on its soil, regardless of their parents’ legal status, since just after the Civil War. Congress and the states adopted the 14th Amendment to the Constitution in 1868, primarily to guarantee citizenship to freed slaves. Over the past three decades, every other developed economy in the world except Canada has abandoned or restricted birthright citizenship amid rising flows of immigrants and refugees. But in America, it remains commonplace. In 2014, 7 percent of all U.S. births — about 275,000 babies — were to parents illegally in the United States, according to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. In Texas, undocumented immigrants accounted for a quarter of all deliveries paid for by Medicaid in 2015 — more than 54,000 babies — according to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. The cost to taxpayers: $116 million. Defenders of birthright citizenship say integrating immigrants is part of what makes the United States exceptional, and that denying these babies citizenship would create a huge new underclass of people living outside the law. Critics say it encourages illegal immigration and drains public resources. Estes was delighted when Trump attacked birthright citizenship during the campaign, saying: “A woman gets pregnant. She’s nine months, she walks across the border, she has the baby in the United States, and we take care of the baby for 85 years. I don’t think so.” Polls show that the vast majority of Americans oppose mass deportations, but Trump’s core supporters are solidly for it: According to a recent CNN/Kaiser poll, 55 percent of whites without college degrees said they want everyone living in the country illegally to be deported. Everywhere Estes looks, she’s reminded that her country is changing. White enrollment in Texas schools recently dipped below 30 percent. Hispanics are the new majority; Pew estimates that more than 13 percent of Texas students are the children of undocumented parents. Estes wants a better-paying job but says it’s hard to get one these days if you speak only English. Increasingly, the first question in any job interview is, “Habla español?” So when Trump started talking about deporting illegal immigrants who “compete directly against vulnerable American workers,” Estes went to his rallies and stuck a Trump sign on her lawn. She has come to be known as the “Trump Lady” on her school bus, which on this Monday morning approaches its first rider, a tiny kindergartner bundled in a gray parka and wearing a purple backpack. “Love you!” the little girl says in English to her Spanish-speaking mother. U.S.-born Rainier Corral, 15, second from right, has breakfast with his family Feb. 19. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) For two hours, Estes picks up dozens of children. They chatter in the seats behind her in Spanish, a language she doesn’t understand. She boils inside about her tax dollars paying for their education. But she likes the kids, and she can’t afford to lose this job. So she smiles and says, over and over: “Careful on the stairs.” “Have a good day, y’all.” Cost and contribution As Estes heads to work, Rainier is in the kitchen next door, checking his phone for news. “Quieres café?” his mother, Azucena Reyes, 34, asks him, as she stirs eggs on the stove. “No, thanks,” he says in English, waving off coffee to check the Young Turks news site on YouTube, where today’s headline is: “Trump’s Deportation Force Unleashed.” Rainier was born four months after Reyes, then 18, entered the United States on a tourist visa hoping to give her child a better life than the one he would have faced in her poor mining town in Durango, Mexico. He has always felt fully American, no different from his white classmates. But now, in this county that voted 83 percent for Trump, he suddenly hears people spitting out: “Go back to your own country,” or “Go mow a lawn.” Rainier practices the guitar at his home. He and his family feel undocumented immigrants have been unfairly blamed for the economic problems of working-class Americans. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) Rumors about deportations are flying. Reyes heard from a friend that immigration agents were arresting people at Walmart. Others say it was at a different store. Or at roadblocks. The family stays home more often now but still went to church yesterday, joining 1,400 others at a Spanish-language Catholic Mass. Their pastor says many more are choosing to skip Mass, worried that federal agents might stake out the church. Reyes is worried, too, but said she and her family agreed to be interviewed for this story because they want people to better understand the immigrants who are being threatened with deportation. Amid so much “uncertainty and fear,” she says, “I hope we can do some good.” What’s happening now doesn’t seem fair to Rainier. Americans hire the undocumented to build their houses, pick their crops, mow their lawns, wash their dishes. They’re happy to take the hard, low-paying jobs nobody else wants. In return, they’d like to live without fear of being deported. Rainier says families like his are being targeted for problems they have not created. “Most of them are just normal people that are trying to get a better way of life,” Rainier says. “It’s one thing to deport people who have criminal records — that’s fine. It’s another thing to deport families that haven’t done anything wrong.” Trump has argued that undocumented immigrants take jobs from American workers, depress wages and overburden government services. Studies have partially confirmed that view, at least in the short term. Last year, an exhaustive study by the respected National Academies of Sciences found that undocumented workers can temporarily depress wages slightly for the lowest category of unskilled jobs. But the study found “little to no negative effects on overall wages and employment of native-born workers in the longer term.” The same study said that newly arrived immigrants are a net cost to taxpayers, primarily due to the expense of educating their children. But those children, and their children after them, more than make up for it, contributing far more in taxes to state and local governments than they take in services. Most economists do not blame illegal immigrants for the decline of the U.S. working class. They argue that immigrants boost the nation’s fortunes by filling undesirable jobs at low pay, cutting the cost of many goods and services. Rainier’s parents have worked for years cleaning homes, working in a glue factory, installing bathroom partitions, nailing baseboards. Four years ago, they pooled their life savings to buy their little house, paying $40,000 in cash at a foreclosure sale. They now pay $1,700 a year in property tax. They file federal returns on income of about $30,000 in a good year, including withholdings for Social Security and Medicare — benefits they are unlikely ever to receive. Rainier, who is an athlete at his high school, lifts his little sister so she can see aquarium fishes at a store in Denton, Tex., on Feb. 19. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) Nationwide, undocumented immigrants pay about $11.7 billion a year in state and local income, sales and property taxes, including about $1.5 billion in Texas, according to the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. And more than 4 million people who do not have Social Security numbers — most of them undocumented immigrants — file federal tax returns using Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers issued by the Internal Revenue Service. Rainier’s family has been trying for two decades to become legal. Since 1997, his father, Nicolas Nevarez, 38, has had an application pending for a resident visa through his father, an undocumented worker granted U.S. citizenship under Ronald Reagan’s 1986 amnesty program. Last year, the United States issued only 801 visas in his category — a Mexican married adult child of a U.S. citizen — out of a waiting list of more than 204,000. His lawyer tells him to be patient. “I’m trying to do everything right,” Nevarez says. “But 20 years?” Nevarez and Reyes have no health insurance and constantly worry about getting sick, although their children are eligible for Medicaid. When Rainier needed knee surgery last year, it was fully covered. Rainier’s parents tell him valora la oportunidad — appreciate the opportunity he has in America — and he does. But he has no idea how he will pay for college, so he is thinking that right after high school he will enlist in the U.S. Army. “It’s my country and I want to serve,” he says, as he picks up his trumpet case and backpack and heads off to school. Fallen from the middle class After finishing her morning route, Estes parks her yellow school bus and clocks out. It’s 9 a.m. Her afternoon shift starts at 2:30. It would take too much gas to drive home and back, so she waits in the parking lot, unpaid, in her Honda Fit. She eats a blueberry muffin out of a plastic bag and listens to the radio, where Mark Davis is praising Trump’s first weeks in office. Estes thinks Trump is off to a great start. She wanted to high-five the new president when he said in his inaugural address, “The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.” She says it was as if Trump was speaking directly to her. Estes grew up in Dallas, in a grand home with a built-in pool. She even had her own horse. Her mother died when she was 4, so she lived with her father, a small-business owner who drove a red Thunderbird convertible. Then her father died when she was 19. She quickly married and, by 26, was divorced with two kids. Tamara Estes tends her chickens, whose eggs she feeds to her Doberman pinschers. She links her financial distress partly to what she sees as job competition from undocumented immigrants. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) She has worked a lifetime of jobs that have paid less and less. She was a scrub tech at a medical clinic, a courier carrying blueprints for a developer, a shuttle driver for a casino. Years ago, she moved an hour north of Dallas, where she could afford a tiny house on a two-acre plot carved from a vast expanse of wheat fields. Now she is almost 60, raised in upper-middle-class comfort and living in working-class stress. Estes regrets not going to college and becoming a veterinarian. On the radio, she hears that good jobs for people with only a high school diploma have been stolen by globalization and automation: China and robots. She knows that it may take Trump more time to bring those jobs back. But she’s thrilled that he is moving on his promise to kick out the “illegals.” “They’ll be out of here so frickin’ fast!” Trump said at a Dallas campaign rally in September 2015, as Estes and 20,000 others cheered. She’s also grateful that a president is finally talking about “anchor babies.” Most legal scholars say that revoking birthright citizenship would take another constitutional amendment, a complicated process that requires two-thirds approval of both chambers of Congress and ratification by three-quarters of the states. Trump, however, has suggested simply challenging the prevailing interpretation in court. “Some very, very good lawyers” believe children of undocumented immigrants “do not have American citizenship,” he said during the campaign. In January, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) reintroduced the Birthright Citizenship Act, which would grant citizenship to an infant only if at least one parent was a U.S. citizen, a lawful permanent resident or a noncitizen serving in the U.S. military. Some Texas officials have pursued a backdoor approach to cutting benefits to the children of undocumented parents by limiting the forms of parental identification they will accept when issuing birth certificates. Without a birth certificate, a child cannot prove citizenship and therefore has no access to government benefits. Estes, a supporter of President Trump, looks at her dog show awards and photos, reflecting on when “it was a happier time in life.” (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) After Mexican and Central American parents sued in federal court, Texas officials agreed last year to accept more forms of identification, including Mexican voter ID cards — but only after more than 1,000 babies were denied birth certificates, said Jennifer Harbury, an attorney with Texas RioGrande Legal Aid. “The anti-immigrant faction is definitely emboldened,” Harbury said. Sitting in her car, Estes switches over to 820 AM, where Rush Limbaugh is singing her tune. “Immigration is the primary reason Donald Trump was elected,” he says. “These ICE raids — people are applauding them!” Alike but far apart By the time Estes finishes her route and arrives back home, the sun has already set. Her headlights splash across her little house, and her dogs start barking. She breeds Doberman pinschers for extra cash. Minutes later, Nevarez pulls into his driveway. The daily routines are similar in these two small, prefabricated houses on a flat road paved into the North Texas prairie. Both families raise chickens and dogs, work long days for little pay and pray for better at church on Sunday. In four years, the neighbors have barely spoken. Once, Nevarez and some other Mexican immigrants helped Estes dig a grave for one of her dogs. She seemed friendly enough. But then the Trump sign appeared on her lawn, and the distance between them grew. At the kitchen table, Rainier, fresh from track practice, devours four enchiladas. His father eats a few bites. He’s tired and doesn’t say much. He spent the day on a 30-foot ladder, hanging shutters on houses. His hair is flecked with sawdust. Next door, Estes is in her kitchen, too tired to cook. Sometimes she eats a few cheese cubes after her evening chores. But when she checks the fridge, there are none left. She sinks into her recliner. She says her opposition to “illegals” isn’t personal. When she needs help around the house, she says, her Hispanic neighbors offer before “my white neighbors do.” She doesn’t want the kids on her bus to think she is heartless for supporting deportation raids. But she says something has to change. She flips on the TV. She has recorded eight hours of inauguration coverage on C-SPAN and a two-hour History Channel documentary on Trump, which she now starts watching. “They are losers! They are babies!” Trump is shouting. She laughs. He sure is entertaining. Trump’s booming voice fills her small house: “The working class is going to strike back!” “Yes,” Estes says. “Yes!” Scott Clement contributed to this report. classic-apps Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

 Six charts that illustrate the divide between rural and urban America Brian Thiede, Lillie Greiman, Stephan Weiler, Steven C. Beda, and Tessa Conroy, The Conversation Mar. 17, 2017, 8:08 PM 413 facebook linkedin twitter email print Editor’s note: We’ve all heard of the great divide between life in rural and urban America. But what are the factors that contribute to these differences? We asked sociologists, economists, geographers and historians to describe the divide from different angles. The data paint a richer and sometimes surprising picture of the U.S. today. 1. Poverty is higher in rural areas Discussions of poverty in the United States often mistakenly focus on urban areas. While urban poverty is a unique challenge, rates of poverty have historically been higher in rural than urban areas. In fact, levels of rural poverty were often double those in urban areas throughout the 1950s and 1960s. While these rural-urban gaps have diminished markedly, substantial differences persist. In 2015, 16.7 percent of the rural population was poor, compared with 13.0 percent of the urban population overall – and 10.8 percent among those living in suburban areas outside of principal cities. </p> <p> Contrary to common assumptions, substantial shares of the poor are employed. Approximately 45 percent of poor, prime-age (25-54) <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/technical-documentation/subject-definitions.html#householder" rel="nofollow">householders</a> worked at least part of 2015 in rural and urban areas alike. </p> <p> The link between work and poverty was different in the past. In the early 1980s, the share of the rural poor that was employed exceeded that in urban areas by more than 15 percent. Since then, more and more poor people in rural areas are also unemployed – a trend consistent with other patterns documented below. </p> <p> That said, rural workers continue to benefit less from work than their urban counterparts. In 2015, 9.8 percent of rural, prime-age working householders were poor, compared with 6.8 percent of their urban counterparts. Nearly a third of the rural working poor faced extreme levels of deprivation, with family incomes below 50 percent of the poverty line, or approximately US$12,000 for a family of four. </p> <p> Large shares of the rural workforce also live in economically precarious circumstances just above the poverty line. Nearly one in five rural working householders lived in families with incomes less than 150 percent of the poverty line. That’s nearly five percentage points more than among urban workers (13.5 percent). </p> <p> According to <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743016716300225" rel="nofollow">recent research</a>, rural-urban gaps in working poverty cannot be explained by rural workers’ levels of education, industry of employment or other similar factors that might affect earnings. Rural poverty – at least among workers – cannot be fully explained by the characteristics of the rural population. That means reducing rural poverty will require attention to the structure of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/08/07/the-places-are-poor-and-the-people-are-poor/?utm_term=.2a95ae1858d2" rel="nofollow">rural economies and communities</a>. </p> <p> – <em>Brian Thiede, Assistant Professor of Rural Sociology and Demography, Pennsylvania State University</em>  </p> <h2> 2. Most new jobs aren’t in rural areas </h2> <p> It’s easy to see why many rural Americans believe the recession never ended: For them, it hasn’t. </p> <p> <iframe width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/YFJz6/3/"/> </p> <p> Rural communities still haven’t recovered the jobs they lost in the recession. Census data show that the rural job market is smaller now – 4.26 percent smaller, to be exact – than it was in 2008. In these data are shuttered coal mines on the edges of rural towns and boarded-up gas stations on rural main streets. In these data are the angers, fears and frustrations of much of rural America. </p> <p> This isn’t a new trend. Mechanization, environmental regulations and increased global competition have been slowly whittling away at resource extraction economies and driving jobs from rural communities for most of the 20th century. But the fact that what they’re experiencing now is simply the cold consequences of history likely brings little comfort to rural people. If anything, it only adds to their fear that what they once had is gone and it’s never coming back. </p> <p> Nor is it likely that the slight increase in rural jobs since 2013 brings much comfort. As the resource extraction economy continues to shrink, most of the new jobs in rural areas are being created in the <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/rural-economy-population/employment-education/rural-employment-and-unemployment/" rel="nofollow">service sector</a>. So Appalachian coal miners and Northwest loggers are now stocking shelves at the local Walmart. </p> <p> The identity of rural communities used to be rooted in work. The signs at the entrances of their towns welcomed visitors to coal country or timber country. Towns named their high school mascots after the work that sustained them, like the Jordan <a href="http://www.jhsalumniassociation.com/why_beetdiggers.php" rel="nofollow">Beetpickers</a> in Utah or the Camas <a href="http://chs.camas.wednet.edu/" rel="nofollow">Papermakers</a> in Washington. It used to be that, when someone first arrived at these towns, they knew what people did and that they were proud to do it. </p> <p> That’s not so clear anymore. How do you communicate your communal identity when the work once at the center of that identity is gone, and calling the local high school football team the “Walmart Greeters” simply doesn’t have the same ring to it? </p> <p> Looking at rural jobs data, is it so hard to understand why many rural people are nostalgic for the past and fearful for the future? </p> <p> – <em>Steven Beda, Instructor of History, University of Oregon</em> </p> <h2> 3. Disabilities are more common in rural areas </h2> <p> Disability matters in rural America. Data from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html" rel="nofollow">American Community Survey</a>, an annual government poll, reveal that disability is more prevalent in rural counties than their urban counterparts. </p> <p> The rate of disability increases from 11.8 percent in the most urban metropolitan counties to 15.6 percent in smaller micropolitan areas and 17.7 percent in the most rural, or noncore, counties. </p> <p> <iframe width="100%" height="227" frameborder="0" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2AKpL/3/"/> </p> <p> While <a href="http://scholarworks.umt.edu/ruralinst_independent_living_community_participation/5/" rel="nofollow">rural-urban differences</a> in disability have been analyzed previously, researchers have had little opportunity to further explore this disparity, as updated data on rural disability were unavailable until <a href="http://rtc.ruralinstitute.umt.edu/research-findings/geography/" rel="nofollow">recently</a>. Fortunately, the census released updated new county-level disability estimates in 2014, ending a 14-year knowledge gap. </p> <p> The release of these estimates has also allowed us to build a picture of geographic variations in disability across the nation. Disability rates vary significantly across the U.S. Although the national trend of higher disability rates in rural counties persists at the regional and even divisional <a href="http://rtc.ruralinstitute.umt.edu/research-findings/geography/disability-region/" rel="nofollow">level</a>, it is clear that disability in rural America is not homogeneous. Rates of rural disability range from around 15 percent in the Great Plains to 21 percent in the central South. </p> <p> <span class="KonaFilter image-container display-table image on-image" data-post-image=""> <img src="http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/58cc4961d349f949008b5233-754" alt="image 20170308 24192 1xrq31w" data-mce-source="American Community Survey (ACS) 2011-2015 5 year estimates, Table S1810, CC BY" data-mce-caption="Data reveal notable differences between rural and urban America" data-link="http://rtc.ruralinstitute.umt.edu/resources/disability-counts-data-finder/"/> <span class="caption-source"> <span class="caption">Data reveal notable differences between rural and urban America</span> <span class="source"> <a href="http://rtc.ruralinstitute.umt.edu/resources/disability-counts-data-finder/">American Community Survey (ACS) 2011-2015 5 year estimates, Table S1810, CC BY</a> </span> </span> </span> </p> <p> A variety of factors may be behind these regional and rural differences, including differences in <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953601000880" rel="nofollow">demographics</a>, <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ556558" rel="nofollow">economic patterns</a>, health and <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/104420730001000205?legid=spdps%3B10%2F2%2F207&amp;patientinform-links=yes&amp;" rel="nofollow">service access</a> and state disability <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1970314" rel="nofollow">policies</a>. </p> <p> While this survey provides a glimpse into the national prevalence of disability and reveals a persistent rural-urban disparity, it is important to note its limitations. <a href="http://www.who.int/topics/disabilities/en/" rel="nofollow">Disability</a> is the result of an interaction between an individual and his or her environment. Therefore, these data do not directly <a href="https://www.census.gov/people/disability/methodology/acs.html" rel="nofollow">measure disability</a>, as they measure only physical function and do not consider environmental factors such as <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15575330.2015.1108989" rel="nofollow">inaccessible housing</a>. </p> <p> – <em>Lillie Greiman and Andrew Myers, Project Directors at the Rural Institute for Inclusive Communities at the University of Montana; Christiane von Reichert, Professor of Geography, University of Montana</em> </p> <p>   </p> <hr/> <p>   </p> <h2> 4. Rural areas are surprisingly entrepreneurial </h2> <p> The United States’ continuing economic dominance is perhaps most attributable to the very smallest elements of its economy: its entrepreneurial start-ups. <a href="https://www.census.gov/ces/dataproducts/bds/" rel="nofollow">Nearly 700,000 new job-creating businesses</a> open each year. That’s almost 2,000 every day, each helping to create new market niches in the global economy. </p> <p> Most people mistakenly believe these pioneering establishments occur in overwhelmingly in metropolitan areas, such as in the now-mythic start-up culture of Silicon Valley. </p> <p> Yet, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, it is in fact nonmetropolitan counties that have higher rates of self-employed business proprietors than their metropolitan counterparts. </p> <p> <iframe width="100%" height="528" frameborder="0" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/n3sbw/5/"/> </p> <p> Furthermore, the more rural the county, the higher its level of entrepreneurship. Some of these counties have a farming legacy – perhaps the most entrepreneurial of occupations – but farmers represent <a href="https://www.bea.gov/regional/" rel="nofollow">less than one-sixth</a> of business owners in nonmetro areas. Even for nonfarm enterprises, rural entrepreneurship rates are higher. </p> <p> The reality is that rural areas have to be entrepreneurial, as industries with concentrations of wage and salary jobs are necessarily scarce. </p> <p> Start-up businesses have notoriously difficult survival prospects. So it is perhaps even more surprising that relatively isolated nonmetropolitan businesses are on average more resilient than their metro cousins, despite the considerable economic advantages of urban areas, which boast a denser networks of workers, suppliers and markets. The resilience of rural start-ups is perhaps due to more cautious business practices in areas with few alternative employment options. </p> <p> <iframe width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5bZO2/4/"/> </p> <p> This resilience is also remarkably persistent over time, consistently being at least on par with metro start-ups, and regularly having survival rates up to 10 percentage points higher than in metro areas over 1990-2007. </p> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://theconversation.com/javascripts/lib/content_tracker_hook.js"

(AP) — A Wal-Mart in the Phoenix area was evacuated over what turned out to be a fake bomb. Peoria police say a store employee reported the suspicious-looking device found in a stockroom about 10:20 a.m. Saturday. A bomb squad and robot were called in to check the item, which was made to look like an explosive with wires and flashing lights. It was removed and the store was combed to ensure safety. The scene was cleared in about four hours, and the store reopened. Police say the hoax device didn't pose a danger but it caused fear and concern and authorities will be checking surveillance video as part of their investigation. No suspect has been identified. Wal-Mart issued a statement saying it takes "the safety and security of our customers and associates seriously at all times" and is helping the police with the investigation.

Read today's eNewspaper Transportation continues to be big discussion item for commissioners Emily ChappellContact ReporterCarroll County Times Transportation was a key discussion points for the commissioners last week. Transportation issues — including the fiscal year 2018 annual transportation plan, transit vehicles and the evening pilot program — were key discussion points for commissioners last week. The Carroll County Board of Commissioners was briefed on the evening pilot program, which started in December and concludes in May. The program runs 5 to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday in a 5-mile radius of the Westminster public library. In its first three months, according to Jeff Topper, the county's deputy director of the Department of Public Works, they're seeing just over one passenger per hour. But from what they've heard from the Maryland Department of Transportation, he said, a new program takes 18 months to two years to more accurately determine how it's going. There was talk about whether expanding the hours to 5 to 9 p.m. could help, though ultimately the commissioners did not vote to head in that direction. Commissioners to discuss transportation, grant applications this week Emily Chappell The Carroll County Board of Commissioners will meet multiple times this week. On Tuesday, the commissioners will meet starting at 9 a.m. in Room 311 of the County Office Building. They will hold a legislative briefing and discuss the fiscal year 2018 Annual Transportation Plan. On Thursday, the... The Carroll County Board of Commissioners will meet multiple times this week. On Tuesday, the commissioners will meet starting at 9 a.m. in Room 311 of the County Office Building. They will hold a legislative briefing and discuss the fiscal year 2018 Annual Transportation Plan. On Thursday, the... (Emily Chappell) Commissioner Doug Howard, R-District 5, suggested reaching out to potential destinations, or lining up with shift changes at local businesses like Walmart. Commissioners bounced around the idea of trying to work with Carroll Community College to see whether students there need rides. But, Commissioner Richard Rothschild, R-District 4, said, people going to school have already figured out how to get there, be it having their own vehicle or going with classmates. "There's not enough demand for this service. This pilot failed," Rothschild said. Howard disagreed. "The pilot's not done," he said. Ultimately, the commissioners voted to expand the service by location, but not by time. In its final few months, the program will not be limited to just the original 5-mile radius in Westminster. The vote passed, with Howard abstaining and Commissioner Stephen Wantz, R-District 1, absent. The commissioners again discussed transit vehicles. Currently, the county is waiting on a number of vehicles from the state. Carroll is still waiting for 16 transit vehicles used for the Carroll Transit System that had been approved by the Maryland Transit Administration in fiscal years 2014, 2015 and 2017. But the bids were contested, and when this happens, the state must go through a legal process. Commissioners again weighed the pros and cons of leasing or buying vehicles to bridge the gap until the vehicles from the state arrive. If the county leases vehicles, at the end of the lease all they have is a smaller bank account, said Jeff Castonguay, the county's director of the Department of Public Works. "You're leasing these vehicles and at the end of the day you have nothing," he said. If they purchase, they can use the vehicles in whatever way they'd like, he added. "That gives us some additional flexibility," Castonguay said. The commissioners made no action on the item, though it is set to come up again this week for a vote. The commissioners also attempted to discuss the fiscal year 2018 Annual Transportation Plan, although after a long discussion, there was confusion about numbers from the previous year and using them to compare to this year's budget. Commissioners eventually asked to have the plan presented at this week's Tuesday meeting before making any decisions. emily.chappell@carrollcountytimes.com 410-857-7862 Caption Eldersburg couple to hike the Appalachian Trail, raise awareness of mental illness Lynsey and Trevor Abrams will hike the length of the Appalachian Trail to raise awareness of mental illness and to raise funds for the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation.

(View our Privacy Policy) Alex Cobb bracing himself for possible farewell season with Rays Marc Topkin, Times Staff Writer Link View all Articles MARC TOPKINTampa Bay Times Saturday, March 18, 2017 8:06pm Print 0 My Edition I want to see more articles tagged I'm already following articles tagged Previous Next Previous Next PORT CHARLOTTE — Is there anything wrong with thinking about saying goodbye when you're not 100 percent sure you're leaving? Related News/Archive Rays journal: All-Star season nets meager raise for Alex Colome ... for now 1 Week Ago Rays' Cobb sees positives in first spring appearance 3 Weeks Ago Rays' Cobb optimistic about latest progress 1 Week Ago Alex Cobb is no dumb blond. He's savvy enough to know the history — that as a frontline starting pitcher headed to free agency, he most likely will be traded by the Rays during the summer. "It's just the way things unfold here," he said. "If you were a betting man, that probably would be the way to go." Cobb, 29, would like to think there are other options. The one he fancies is that he is pitching so well, and the Rays are winning so much, that they have no choice but to keep him for a march deep into the postseason, and then he heads out. Or the Rays could preempt free agency and re-sign him during the season at market price, extending what has been a 12-year stay in the organization. Or his first full season back from Tommy John surgery could go bad, and due to injury or ineffectiveness, he could find himself without a better offer and sign on for another year. But for now, it's hard for Cobb to not think this is the beginning of a long goodbye. And it starts in Port Charlotte, his spring, and summer rehab, home since the team's 2009 move south. "It's a difficult thought, and it's one that I've had a lot this spring," Cobb said. "I've found myself driving around, whether it's to Wal-Mart or to Publix, or going by the Chili's where we'd hang out because it was near the (minor-leaguers') hotel, and I'm thinking about the first year I was here in Port Charlotte and all the different things that have happened here. Life-changing stuff. "Then you go into the clubhouse and you see all the faces, people that I've seen since I was 18, that really have been your family since then. It's part of spring training — you give that guy a hug, you ask how their family is doing, they ask about yours, you reminisce about the times you had in the past. … "You think about it, and it's sad. It's sad that it's a possibility I could no longer be around here." Sure, you can say if Cobb felt that badly about leaving, he shouldn't. That — especially after making $4 million each of the past two seasons (for 22 innings and one win in the majors), and another $4.2 million this year — he should just take whatever the Rays offer and stay. But that's not how this works. A player toils for the chance to reach free agency after six years in the majors, and he has the right to get paid. (Also, consider that Cobb already missed on cashing in once already as he was negotiating a long-term deal worth nearly $50 million when he hurt his elbow two springs ago. And, that former teammate Jeremy Hellickson is making $17.2 million — SEVENTEEN-POINT-TWO-MILLION — this season from the Phillies.) Nor should you pin this on the Rays, as they have the right to maximize their assets, and with all the young — and inexpensive — pitching they have in the system to replace Cobb (such as Jose De Leon), getting something for him in July is only logical. There are already whispers of potential interest elsewhere, including two teams with intimate connections — the Cubs, managed by ex-Ray Joe Maddon; and the Dodgers, presidented by ex-Ray Andrew Friedman. That is no surprise, because as good as a healthy Cobb can be on the mound — "top 10 in all of baseball," teammate Chris Archer opines — he may have even more value for his leadership and bulldog attitude. "We know what he brings to our pitching staff and our clubhouse," Rays manager Kevin Cash said. "We all understand how important Alex is to us." First, Cobb has to show that he is indeed back to being Alex Cobb. That it's more than just braggadocio and wishful thinking for him to say there is "zero doubt" he can return to 2013-14 form, when, despite a concussion (from being hit by a line drive) and an oblique strain, he was 21-12, 2.82 in 49 starts. "It's the smaller pixels I'm looking for," Cobb said. "The larger picture of it is there." Then there will be the question of where the path leads. If elsewhere, the memories will be well-cataloged: The thrill of working out with the big-league Devil Rays at the Trop after being a fourth-round pick in 2006. The smell of the locker room the day he arrived in Princeton, W.Va., as a pro, and the nerves — "my heart was beating out of my chest, everything was going a million miles an hour" — of his first game. The unbridled joy of his promotion to the majors, and the best-day-ever feel of his on May 1, 2011, big-league debut, with his dad and brother in the stands. The fear of a career- or even life-threatening injury when struck in the head by an Eric Hosmer line drive in June 2013, then the satisfaction of returning for his thus far career-highlight moment, starting and winning the AL wild-card game. And the frustration of the pain he felt during the 2015 St. Patrick's Day start in Clearwater leading to Tommy John surgery, and this two-year odyssey back. Cobb has been through so much in his life, most jarringly the sudden death of his mother during his senior year in high school, and he has seen so many good friends traded (James Shields, David Price, Hellickson, Matt Moore, etc.), that he is certain he won't be fazed no matter what happens or where he ends up. But that doesn't mean he won't be thinking about saying goodbye. "There will definitely be moments throughout the season when it will hit me," he said. "It won't be every day where I wake up and say, 'Hey, this could be my last day here.' … But it will be like mindless driving down the highway thinking about it. And it'll be a little sad."

The White House and the Justice Department would not confirm the pick Saturday, March 18, 2017. George Conway declined to comment. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) Washington — President Donald Trump has chosen the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway to head the civil division of the Justice Department, The Wall Street Journal reported. George Conway was chosen to head the office that has responsibility for defending the administration's proposed travel ban and defending lawsuits filed against the administration, the newspaper reported. Conway is a partner at the New York law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. The law firm's website says Conway has extensive experience in litigation involving securities, mergers and acquisitions, contracts and antitrust cases. He graduated from Harvard and then Yale Law School. He joined the law firm in 1988, soon after his graduation from law school. He has been involved in numerous complex, high-profile cases with that law firm, where he has been a partner since 1994. In the 1990s, Conway wrote the Supreme Court brief that cleared the way for Paula Jones' civil suit against President Bill Clinton. Clinton's denial of an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky during a deposition in the Jones case led to his impeachment trial. The White House and the Justice Department would not confirm the pick Saturday. George Conway declined to comment. Kellyanne Conway is a longtime Republican pollster who helped turn around Trump's presidential campaign at a critical time last summer. She joined the campaign as a senior adviser and quickly earned the candidate's trust. She's also close with daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, another influential voice in Trump's inner circle. Kellyanne Conway stepped in to manage Trump's bid against Democrat Hillary Clinton when the campaign began flailing in the face of a series of controversies. Many credit her with boosting him toward his Election Day victory after she urged him to more closely follow the teleprompter in his speeches and helped him deliver clearer talking points that minimized controversy in the final days of the campaign. U.S. temporarily bans larger electronics from cabins of certain flights Published: Tuesday, March 21, 2017 @ 3:07 AM By: Patrick McMahon, Rare.us Woman typing on laptop computer in commercial airplane (Jason Dewey / The Image Bank / Getty Images)(Jason Dewey/Getty Images) Jason Dewey/Getty Images A temporary ban on carry-on electronics is set to take effect Tuesday on certain flights into the U.S., according to reporting from The Hill and supported by tweets posted by Royal Jordanian Airlines. Those tweets have since been deleted but read, “Following instructions from the concerned U.S. departments, we kindly inform our dearest passengers departing to and arriving from the United States that carrying any electronic or electrical device on board the flight cabins is strictly prohibited,” according to The Hill. >> Read more trending news The ban will be formally announced Tuesday but is said to affect 13 countries for the next 96 hours and is a response to a specific intelligence threat, The Hill reported, citing Fox News. The ban reportedly has nothing to do with President Donald Trump’s travel ban, two versions of which have now been struck down by courts across the country. Affected countries, airlines and flights are in the process of being informed, CNN reported. The ban reportedly applies to all electronics except mobile phones and medical devices; items such as laptops, tablets and cameras may not be brought into the cabin but can fly in checked luggage. White House promotes satirical article praising Trump's new budget Published: Sunday, March 19, 2017 @ 2:34 AM By: Elizabeth Vale, Rare.us Talk about "fake news.”  The White House reportedly shared a story Friday that was written as satire.  This was in today's email from the White House. So clearly, literally no one read the linked piece by @petridishes, did they? pic.twitter.com/1cqoDbqgTg— Molly Templeton (@mollytempleton) March 17, 2017 According to the Daily Beast, a newsletter sent by President Donald Trump's administration featured a story by Washington Post columnist Alexandra Petri and headlined, “Trump’s budget makes perfect sense and will fix America, and I will tell you why.” >> Read more trending stories The column was labeled ComPost, so it’s unclear how the Trump administration staff took the article – which featured lines like “AMERICA WILL BE STRONGER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN!” (her emphasis) – seriously.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)(Evan Vucci/AP) Evan Vucci/AP Petri issued a comment to the Daily Beast, telling the publication, “I am honored to finally be real, true news, which is all I’ve ever striven for.” She added: “It goes to show that as long as you confirm what the Trump White House wants to believe, you, too, can be cited in an email – and you can even work for the mainstream media and do it!”  The columnist concluded her correspondence with the publication by saying that she “can’t stop laughing.” Petri also wrote a follow-up story for The Washington Post. In that story, “How the White House made me Real News,” she came to the conclusion that either White House officials “read it and loved it, especially the part where I wrote that all schoolchildren will be taught by an F-35 in a Make America Great Again hat, or they … did not read it but liked the headline.” The White House has yet to comment on the presumed mistake.

By Priya Joshi Updated March 18, 2017 23:24 GMT Fire broke out at a home owned by Cristy Lynn Campbell, 32 in Glen Carbon, Illinois where her estranged husband was found deadKVOV In a tragic sequence of events, an Illinois man was found dead in a burning house with a gunshot to his head. Several hours later, his ex-wife's body was recovered from a nearby lake. Fire broke out at a home owned by Cristy Lynn Campbell, 32 at 5:15 a.m. on Thursday (16 March) in Glen Carbon, Illinois. Six of her seven children, ranging up to age 14, escaped the burning building and fled to a nearby Walmart store where they raised the alarm. Arriving at the scene, fire-fighters found Cristy's estranged husband and the father of the children, Justin Campbell, 37, dead. Christy had apparently fled in an SUV with the couple's seventh child, a 3-month-old boy. The car was seen driving down a hill into Silver Lake in Highland about 15 minutes after the fire was reported. The baby boy, who was floating inside the car was pulled from the sinking vehicle by paramedic Todd Zobrist who put the baby on the SUV's roof and successfully performed CPR, reviving the child before swimming with him back to shore. Several hours later the body of his mother was recovered from the lake. Madison County Coroner's Office determined Friday that Justin Campbell had died of a gunshot wound and not as a result of the fire, reports KMOV. Investigators have not yet determined how he was shot or how the fire started. A gun was found in the SUV Sheriff John Lakin confirmed. According to court records, there were several reports of domestic incidents at the former couples home. In 2012, Ms Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce, claiming in court papers he "abuses me on a weekly basis". She was granted a divorce the following year. The children are currently in the care of authorities and will be placed with relatives Sky News reports.

I thought for sure we were jinxing ourselves out of a snowstorm when everything started getting shut down on Monday afternoon, but Mother Nature decided to agree with the weather forecasters for once, and we had a glorious snow day. The stars were not aligned for us to have a cozy, relaxing day of rest, however. March Madness isn’t limited to basketball. March is also championship month for swimmers. So, I’ve been on the road with the swim team for the past few weekends, and will be for the rest of the weekends in March. This means that none of the regular household chores have been kept up with, like the cleaning, the grocery shopping, and the laundry. Part of me really wanted a snow day as an excuse to stay home and catch up on some of that, but the other part of me knew that if it was bad enough to stay home from work, the grocery shopping wasn’t going to get done either. That meant being holed up with a bunch of “starving” children who I was going to try to coerce into doing housework. The odds of that turning out well were absolutely nonexistent. So, on my way home from the swim meet on Sunday night, I made a pit stop at the grocery store and tried to stock up on blizzard supplies. I grabbed the makings for a hearty breakfast and a big pot of homemade chicken potpie. I also grabbed the fixings for a plate of nachos, because I was hoping that at some point, we would get to relax and catch up on some family movie time. I also, proactively, I thought, remembered to get lunch supplies for when they eventually did head back to school. About halfway through my grocery shopping trip, I got a text from A. It just so happens that he needed a “non-store bought” superhero costume for school Monday morning. He did tell me about it Friday night, at which time, I informed him that I would be gone all weekend, and he knew where the craft supplies and the dress-up clothes were, and he could have at it. I have to say, this is probably the first time ever that A has waited until the last minute for a project like this. Normally, his brain is bursting with so many ideas, that he can’t wait to get started. But, as our luck would have it, the one time he did wait until the last minute was just about the worst possible timing. So, the text he sent me was the list of supplies that he absolutely needed to finish his costume. At that point, I realized I had two choices: one, I could not buy anything on his list, and then have to deal with a bad attitude from him and more wasted time as he re-evaluated and replanned, or two, I could stop at Walmart and see what I could find. It was already after 9 p.m., so I wasn’t optimistic, but Walmart seemed like the better option. I quickly checked out at the grocery store. In my haste and panic, I also forgot some of the staple items that I haven’t kept up with since I haven’t done a major grocery shopping trip in a few weeks. So, the little bit of time I had on Sunday night to try to catch up with some laundry and household chores was diverted into helping “Grammar Lord” finish his superhero costume. The assignment was to create a superhero to help them defeat the bad guy “PSSAs.” As I was gluing myself together with the hot glue gun, all I could think was that now I understand why everyone hates these things. Monday evening, as I left swim practice, knowing full well that school and work were already canceled, I decided to brave one more run to the grocery store, “just in case.” I texted the Wonderful Husband to ask what we needed. His response was “diet soda and breakfast stuff.” Actually, his response was a lot longer than that, but my phone battery died in the middle of the list, and since I had already gotten the breakfast stuff, I grabbed a few bottles of diet soda and a few baking supplies, as I thought a batch or two of cookies would be a nice treat for the kids when they came in from shoveling. Home I went, blissfully ignorant that the WH had sent an urgent text that we were also almost out of ketchup. The next morning, as the snow piled up, we all sat down to a delicious breakfast of home fries, eggs, bacon, and sausage, topped off with warm blueberry muffins. In a matter of minutes, the kids started circling the remaining half bottle of ketchup like a pack of hyenas. We took the only course of action we could and started everyone on ketchup rations. It was not an auspicious start to the day. I decided that we needed big projects to keep everyone engaged, so I put the kids to work cleaning out the craft/school supply station. There were alternately squeals of joy as long lost projects were happened on and “missing” artifacts were recovered. Then there were squabbles as to who saw what first and of course, someone meandered off to start coloring “because they felt like it.” When at last, the fighting finally got on my nerves, I bundled them up and sent them out to help the WH shovel. We cycled through this for most of the day, and by the time we were on each other’s last nerve, the potpie was ready to eat and we finally settled down to watch “Doctor Strange.” It wasn’t the most memorable snow day ever, but at least it was a productive one.

However, once again the market continued the inexorable climb higher this past week. For the first time this year, the insider buying volume looked to be much closer to the selling in share count, though insider sellers still seemed to dominate in the dollar amount. Either way, with earnings season right around the corner, you can bet many insiders are taking advantage of open transaction windows. We cover insider selling every week at 24/7 Wall St., and we like to remind readers that just because an individual or 10% institutional owner sells stock, that is no cause for immediate alarm. Many top executives, and even directors, are compensated with stock and often sell just to diversify portfolios or purchase other assets. Here are companies that reported notable insider selling this past week. One of the members of the richest family in America was again selling shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) this past week. Robson Walton parted with a block of 3 million shares of the iconic retailer at prices that ranged from $70.34 to $70.86 apiece. The total for the sale was a stunning $212 million. Shares closed last Friday at $69.89. The 52-week trading range for the stock is $62.72 to $75.19, and the Wall Street consensus price target is $74.37. Another famous American company caught a seller last week. Eastman Kodak Co. (NYSE: KODK) had a 10% owner selling shares. Blue Mountain Capital sold a total of 1,353,653 shares, and prices ranged from $11.54 to $11.75 a share. The total for the sale was set at $16 million. The shares closed Friday at $11.50, in a 52 week range of $10 to $17.30. There was no consensus target as the stock is not followed on Wall Street. Del Taco Restaurants Inc. (NASDAQ: TACO) had a director at the company selling stock last week. The board member shed a total of 831,314 shares at between $11.40 and $11.84 apiece. The total for the sale was $10 million. The shares ended the week at $12.36, in a 52-week range of $8.43 to $15.32. The consensus price target is $17.07. Another director at Tyler Technologies Inc. (NYSE: TYL) was also busy selling stock last week. That director sold a total of 53,069 shares of the integrated information management solutions provider at prices that ranged from $155.24 to $156.26. The total for the sale was set at $8 million. The stock closed Friday at $156.35. The consensus price target is $180.09, and the 52-week range is $118.16 to $175.17. Analog Devices Inc. (NYSE: ADI) has been on a huge run, and a director at the chip company took advantage by selling a block of 50,000 shares of the stock at prices that ranged from $83.00 to $83.50. The total of the sale was set at $4 million. The shares ended Friday at $83.26, in a 52-week trading range is $52.17 to $84.24. The consensus price target is $89.42. These companies also reported insider selling last week: Corcept Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: CORT), Customers Bancorp Inc. (NYSE: CUBI), Ellie Mae Inc. (NYSE: ELLI), Fiserv Inc. (NASDAQ: FISV) and Ulta Beauty Inc. (NASDAQ: ULTA). It is pretty safe to assume we will continue to see insider selling strong until earnings season, and if the market stays at or trades up from current levels, the volume and dollar amount could go up as well.

Print Email Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal By Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal The Jersey Journal Follow on Twitter on March 18, 2017 at 9:58 AM comments JERSEY CITY - A 22-year-old Pennsylvania woman has been charged with kicking a police officer arresting her following a disturbance at Walmart in Kearny on Thursday. Aniyyah Harrell is charged with aggravated assault on a police officer, resisting arrest and purposely causing or recklessly creating the risk of public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, the criminal complaint says. Responding officers said they were flagged down by about 15 customers and employees who directed them to the grocery section vestibule where Harrell was assaulting someone, the criminal complaint says. "Harrell's behavior was out of control as she was kicking, pulling away from officer, screaming and cursing." When the officers managed to calm Harrell down, she allegedly provided a fake name, the complaint says. An officer helped Harrell make a few phone calls in an attempt to get a ride but she again became belligerent and violent and the officers placed her under arrest. While being handcuffed, Harrell allegedly kicked an officer in the knee twice, the complaint says. Harrell made her first appearance on the charges yesterday in Criminal Justice Reform Court in Jersey City via video link from Hudson County jail in Kearny. At the hearing, she was order released pending trial with conditions of supervision.

Here's what the company has planned to stay relevant in a digital world. Nicholas Rossolillo (nrossolillo) Mar 18, 2017 at 6:43AM Target (NYSE:TGT) has been pummeled after reporting disappointing 2016 holiday sales and forecasting falling profits in the year ahead. The big-box store is battling a tough retail environment brought on by falling foot traffic as an increasing number of shoppers opt for an online experience. Data by YCharts. Recent investor pessimism was sparked partly by fourth-quarter numbers that showed a fall in revenue and comparable sales, which declined 4.3% and 1.5%, respectively. The other reason for worry coming out of the fourth-quarter report was that management said 2017 earnings per share will come in between $3.80 and $4.20, a 15% decrease at the midpoint from 2016. The reason for the expected drop in the bottom line? Target plans to spend $1 billion in 2017 out of its operating profits to adapt its business model to changing shopper preferences. Over the next three years, a total of $7 billion in investment is planned. It's ambitious, and investors are obviously nervous about it, but Target is ready to fight back against declines in sales. Target's history of innovation Target is no stranger to changing consumer shopping preferences. In the early 1900s, Target, then known as Dayton's after the family that owned it, was a regional department store in the Midwest. By the 1960s, the Dayton's department store chain was doing well in its home state of Minnesota. Times were changing, though, and big-box discount retailers like Wal-Mart were just beginning to pop up around the country. The Daytons decided to jump in the game and launch a new type of discount chain, one that combined department store qualities with the value slant that many shoppers were looking for. The new format was named Target. A Dayton's Department Store in the 1950s. Image source: Target. Times are changing again, but this time, physical stores in general are under attack from more convenient online competition like Amazon.com. Target was an early adopter of online shopping and launched its own digitally formatted store back in 1999, but sales from it have remained a very small part of the overall business. The problem and the solution However, it's worth noting that, since 2013, Target has doubled sales from the internet. In the last reported quarter, online sales increased 34% from the previous year, with digital sales making up 6.8% of sales. However, the problem has been that the move to online hasn't been able to outpace declines in foot traffic. To stop the bleeding, Target's upcoming spending spree is aimed at adapting business to what the consumers now want, including a streamlined digital shopping experience, exclusive brands, competitive prices, and faster delivery. The merchandiser will continue to enhance its online experience, but its existing stores will also play an important role in digital strategy. For starters, by 2019, all physical locations will serve the secondary purpose of distribution center. When customers shop online, their order will be delivered from their nearest Target location. That helps delivery times, but also helps the company operate more efficiently. Target has also been experimenting with smaller-format stores in urban areas and on college campuses. Thirty more are planned to cut ribbons this year, doubling the company's reach with the small format. Other features that will be available this year will include the ability for Target associates to search inventory, place orders, and arrange delivery of merchandise for guests who can't find what they're looking for in-store. Image source: Target. The final area of work will involve the launch of 12 new exclusive brands, an area that has been successful in the past. Over the last year, Target has reported positive sales growth from its exclusive line-ups even while overall sales have struggled. Look for more information in the months ahead on what these new brands will be. Can Target pull it off? Target will be attempting a comeback in a crowd of other traditional retailers all trying to navigate the move to a digital-first shopping experience. It will be a difficult task since Amazon already has a substantial lead in the online selling world. Even in the midst of a tough year, though, Target has managed to increase its free cash flow, or money left over after operating expenses are paid for. Data by YCharts. That spare change will play an important role in the years ahead. Investors can expect to see this metric drop as the company puts some of it to work executing its new plans. Ultimately, the real test will be if sacrificing profitability can help grow top-line sales. Nicholas Rossolillo owns shares of Target. The Motley Fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

This Popular Natural Food Grocer Now Ranks Dead Last in Customer Loyalty A new survey by Brand Keys may explain this grocer's recent woes. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Mar 18, 2017 at 7:09AM For years, the natural and organic grocery sector was a growth star in an otherwise sleepy industry. Companies like Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) and Sprouts Farmers (NASDAQ:SFM) spread like wildfire across the country, trouncing the industry in same-store sales. Through the aughts, Whole Foods' comparable sales were regularly in the double digits as it introduced a new kind of gourmet emporium to much of the country, complete with olive bars and cheesemongers. More recently, though, things have changed. Mainstream grocers like Kroger, Wal-Mart, and Costco have caught on to the organic movement, introducing brands and using their economies of scale to undercut competitors like Whole Foods and Sprouts on price. Image source: Getty Images. As a result, stocks in the organic segment have plummeted.  SFM data by YCharts. As the chart above shows, leading natural foods suppliers like United Natural Foods (NASDAQ:UNFI) and Hain Celestial (NASDAQ:HAIN) also took a hit from the industry shift. Still, another surprising trend appears to be afoot in the industry.  Brand Keys, a consulting firm that does an annual Customer Loyalty Engagement Index, has measured such relationships between consumers and brands for years across several industries. Customer loyalty is a key factor for almost all companies' success, but especially for grocers who rely on repeat customer visits. Without customer loyalty, grocers are much more likely to lose business to competitors.   Surprisingly, Brand Keys found that the company ranking dead last in customer loyalty among natural food stores was Whole Foods, the company generally considered to be the industry leader.  Trader Joe's ranked No. 1 in the survey, followed by The Fresh Market, which was taken private last year by Apollo Global Management, and then Sprouts, and finally Whole Foods.  Is Whole Foods broken? Perhaps it shouldn't be surprising that Whole Foods would rank last in customer loyalty in its industry. The company has seen comparable sales fall for six quarters in a row as management has struggled to turn around performance. The company, long derided as "Whole Paycheck" by detractors who claimed that their prices were too high, also saw its reputation take a hit when an NYC investigation in 2015 found the company had been mis-weighing some packaged items and was therefore overcharging some customers, which caused a brief sales dip as the news went national. Whole Foods has not been sitting still as its sales have wilted, though. To combat its reputation for high prices, the company has begun offering more sales and discounts, and it even introduced a loyalty program. CEO John Mackey has said that the company is trying to compete on quality rather than price, but he understands the need to be competitive on pricing.  Image source: They Motley Fool. Last year, Whole Foods also launched a new budget-priced chain, 365, which is targeted at millennials and bears a close resemblance to Trader Joe's. The new concept heavily features Whole Foods' private-label 365 brand and prepared foods and eschews the specialists like butchers and fishmongers that are found at a traditional Whole Foods. The company also streamlined its management structure, eliminating the co-CEO positions, along with former co-CEO Walter Robb, in favor of just one CEO. None of those changes have had a noticeable effect on sales or the bottom line for Whole Foods, though, as the company continues to struggle with headwinds affecting the entire industry like food deflation, which has brought down retail prices across the board. That the rest of the natural foods sector is challenged may indicate that the company is not fully responsible for its own problems, but the industry is quickly changing. Whole Foods faces competition from more than just traditional grocers. Meal-kit services have popped up lately, allowing to the kind of customers Whole Foods targets to skip the trip to the grocery store and get their weekly dinners in a box. Similarly, farmers markets and community-supported agriculture co-ops have also become more popular, relieving the need for grocery-store visits. Consumers are also increasingly seeking out delivery options as well, and Amazon has spread its Fresh grocery delivery service to most major metropolitan areas across the country. Whole Foods' latest guidance was also discouraging as the company sees comparable sales for the fiscal year ending in September falling as much as 2.5%. Comparable sales will eventually hit bottom, but it's clear from both Whole Foods' and the overall industry's results that the days of double-digit comp sales increases are not coming back. At this point, Whole Foods stock seems unlikely to return to its former heights. John Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory Brian Thiede, Pennsylvania State University; Lillie Greiman, The University of Montana; Stephan Weiler, Colorado State University; Steven C. Beda, University of Oregon, and Tessa Conroy, University of Wisconsin-Madison Editor’s note: We’ve all heard of the great divide between life in rural and urban America. But what are the factors that contribute to these differences? We asked sociologists, economists, geographers and historians to describe the divide from different angles. The data paint a richer and sometimes surprising picture of the U.S. today. 1. Poverty is higher in rural areas Discussions of poverty in the United States often mistakenly focus on urban areas. While urban poverty is a unique challenge, rates of poverty have historically been higher in rural than urban areas. In fact, levels of rural poverty were often double those in urban areas throughout the 1950s and 1960s. While these rural-urban gaps have diminished markedly, substantial differences persist. In 2015, 16.7 percent of the rural population was poor, compared with 13.0 percent of the urban population overall – and 10.8 percent among those living in suburban areas outside of principal cities. Contrary to common assumptions, substantial shares of the poor are employed. Approximately 45 percent of poor, prime-age (25-54) householders worked at least part of 2015 in rural and urban areas alike. The link between work and poverty was different in the past. In the early 1980s, the share of the rural poor that was employed exceeded that in urban areas by more than 15 percent. Since then, more and more poor people in rural areas are also unemployed – a trend consistent with other patterns documented below. That said, rural workers continue to benefit less from work than their urban counterparts. In 2015, 9.8 percent of rural, prime-age working householders were poor, compared with 6.8 percent of their urban counterparts. Nearly a third of the rural working poor faced extreme levels of deprivation, with family incomes below 50 percent of the poverty line, or approximately US$12,000 for a family of four. Large shares of the rural workforce also live in economically precarious circumstances just above the poverty line. Nearly one in five rural working householders lived in families with incomes less than 150 percent of the poverty line. That’s nearly five percentage points more than among urban workers (13.5 percent). According to recent research, rural-urban gaps in working poverty cannot be explained by rural workers’ levels of education, industry of employment or other similar factors that might affect earnings. Rural poverty – at least among workers – cannot be fully explained by the characteristics of the rural population. That means reducing rural poverty will require attention to the structure of rural economies and communities. – Brian Thiede, Assistant Professor of Rural Sociology and Demography, Pennsylvania State University 2. Most new jobs aren’t in rural areas It’s easy to see why many rural Americans believe the recession never ended: For them, it hasn’t. Rural communities still haven’t recovered the jobs they lost in the recession. Census data show that the rural job market is smaller now – 4.26 percent smaller, to be exact – than it was in 2008. In these data are shuttered coal mines on the edges of rural towns and boarded-up gas stations on rural main streets. In these data are the angers, fears and frustrations of much of rural America. This isn’t a new trend. Mechanization, environmental regulations and increased global competition have been slowly whittling away at resource extraction economies and driving jobs from rural communities for most of the 20th century. But the fact that what they’re experiencing now is simply the cold consequences of history likely brings little comfort to rural people. If anything, it only adds to their fear that what they once had is gone and it’s never coming back. Nor is it likely that the slight increase in rural jobs since 2013 brings much comfort. As the resource extraction economy continues to shrink, most of the new jobs in rural areas are being created in the service sector. So Appalachian coal miners and Northwest loggers are now stocking shelves at the local Walmart. The identity of rural communities used to be rooted in work. The signs at the entrances of their towns welcomed visitors to coal country or timber country. Towns named their high school mascots after the work that sustained them, like the Jordan Beetpickers in Utah or the Camas Papermakers in Washington. It used to be that, when someone first arrived at these towns, they knew what people did and that they were proud to do it. That’s not so clear anymore. How do you communicate your communal identity when the work once at the center of that identity is gone, and calling the local high school football team the “Walmart Greeters” simply doesn’t have the same ring to it? Looking at rural jobs data, is it so hard to understand why many rural people are nostalgic for the past and fearful for the future? – Steven Beda, Instructor of History, University of Oregon 3. Disabilities are more common in rural areas Disability matters in rural America. Data from the American Community Survey, an annual government poll, reveal that disability is more prevalent in rural counties than their urban counterparts. The rate of disability increases from 11.8 percent in the most urban metropolitan counties to 15.6 percent in smaller micropolitan areas and 17.7 percent in the most rural, or noncore, counties. While rural-urban differences in disability have been analyzed previously, researchers have had little opportunity to further explore this disparity, as updated data on rural disability were unavailable until recently. Fortunately, the census released updated new county-level disability estimates in 2014, ending a 14-year knowledge gap. The release of these estimates has also allowed us to build a picture of geographic variations in disability across the nation. Disability rates vary significantly across the U.S. Although the national trend of higher disability rates in rural counties persists at the regional and even divisional level, it is clear that disability in rural America is not homogeneous. Rates of rural disability range from around 15 percent in the Great Plains to 21 percent in the central South. Data reveal notable differences between rural and urban America. American Community Survey (ACS) 2011-2015 5 year estimates, Table S1810, CC BY A variety of factors may be behind these regional and rural differences, including differences in demographics, economic patterns, health and service access and state disability policies. While this survey provides a glimpse into the national prevalence of disability and reveals a persistent rural-urban disparity, it is important to note its limitations. Disability is the result of an interaction between an individual and his or her environment. Therefore, these data do not directly measure disability, as they measure only physical function and do not consider environmental factors such as inaccessible housing. – Lillie Greiman and Andrew Myers, Project Directors at the Rural Institute for Inclusive Communities at the University of Montana; Christiane von Reichert, Professor of Geography, University of Montana 4. Rural areas are surprisingly entrepreneurial The United States’ continuing economic dominance is perhaps most attributable to the very smallest elements of its economy: its entrepreneurial start-ups. Nearly 700,000 new job-creating businesses open each year. That’s almost 2,000 every day, each helping to create new market niches in the global economy. Most people mistakenly believe these pioneering establishments occur in overwhelmingly in metropolitan areas, such as in the now-mythic start-up culture of Silicon Valley. Yet, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, it is in fact nonmetropolitan counties that have higher rates of self-employed business proprietors than their metropolitan counterparts. Furthermore, the more rural the county, the higher its level of entrepreneurship. Some of these counties have a farming legacy – perhaps the most entrepreneurial of occupations – but farmers represent less than one-sixth of business owners in nonmetro areas. Even for nonfarm enterprises, rural entrepreneurship rates are higher. The reality is that rural areas have to be entrepreneurial, as industries with concentrations of wage and salary jobs are necessarily scarce. Start-up businesses have notoriously difficult survival prospects. So it is perhaps even more surprising that relatively isolated nonmetropolitan businesses are on average more resilient than their metro cousins, despite the considerable economic advantages of urban areas, which boast a denser networks of workers, suppliers and markets. The resilience of rural start-ups is perhaps due to more cautious business practices in areas with few alternative employment options. This resilience is also remarkably persistent over time, consistently being at least on par with metro start-ups, and regularly having survival rates up to 10 percentage points higher than in metro areas over 1990-2007. – Stephan Weiler, Professor of Economics, Colorado State University; Tessa Conroy and Steve Deller, Professors of Economics, University of Wisconsin-Madison Brian Thiede, Assistant Professor of Rural Sociology and Demography, Pennsylvania State University; Lillie Greiman, Research Associate, The University of Montana; Stephan Weiler, Professor of Economics, Colorado State University; Steven C.

Scott Applewhite) Washington — Republicans intent on scrapping Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act have a budget problem. As it turns out, repealing and replacing the law they hate so much won't save nearly as much money as getting rid of it entirely, the goal they've been campaigning on for seven years. That means trouble for the federal deficit and for Congress' fiscal conservatives who repeatedly warn about leaving their children and grandchildren worse off financially. President Donald Trump and other GOP leaders know they can't just get rid of the law; instead they've vowed to "repeal and replace" it. So they've come up with a bill that would fix Obama's "disaster" and insist it would give Americans more choices on health coverage. But it only reduces the deficit by $337 billion over a decade and doesn't move the federal budget much closer to being balanced, if at all. That's one big reason many budget-conscious Republicans have joined Democrats in opposing the repeal-and-replace version pushed by the White House and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. In proposing his 2018 budget on Thursday, Trump called for spending billions more on defense while slashing domestic programs. He vowed during the campaign to leave the costly mandatory programs such as Medicare and Social Security untouched, and he won't raise taxes. That budget plan guarantees large deficits. "Our military is more important to me than a balanced budget," Trump said in a Fox News interview in January. The initial Republican plan to completely scuttle the 2010 health care law promised a cut of more than $2 trillion from the deficit over 10 years. The GOP health care bill cuts the deficit by much less. "Now that (health care repeal) is actually going to happen, they've changed their priorities greatly so that they're not actually trying to generate any significant savings," said Maya MacGuineas, president of Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a Washington-based advocacy group for budget discipline. "And there's no sign what they can fill it in with." A senior member of the House Budget Committee, Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., says: "Oh yeah, there's no question. It's much tougher, much tougher" to balance the budget after repealing and replacing the health care law. What would be left behind, according to the Congressional Budget Office, is $9 trillion in projected deficits over the coming decade and fewer ways for Trump and Republicans controlling Congress to cut. The worsening deficit creates a huge problem for other critical pieces of Trump's agenda, including tax reform, a big infusion of infrastructure spending or helping people with the costs of child care. First, swelling deficits mean less money for such legislation. The deepening debt hole also means problems when Republicans try to pass a budget outline this spring, since some tea party Republicans and deficit hard-liners will insist on promising to balance the budget even though the math no longer works. More realistic lawmakers will resist that. Under the arcane congressional budget process, the yearly budget blueprint doesn't by itself make any changes to government programs, but it makes it easier to enact follow-up legislation like tax reform, which is the top GOP priority after dealing with health care. But if they can't pass a budget, Republicans can't pass tax reform — at least without help from Senate Democrats — because of Senate rules. The fiscal picture, meanwhile, has another complication. If Republicans can successfully pass their health care repeal and replacement they will have used up their opportunity to cut Medicaid to generate savings toward a balanced budget. The health measure promises an enormous $880 billion cut from Medicaid over 10 years and it's not credible to say Republicans could claim more in subsequent legislation. "They've taken (Medicaid) off the table," said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist and former Congressional Budget Office director. "The math doesn't work," said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. "Just nothing that they're doing adds up right now." How big is the problem? According to calculations by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, if House Republicans were to simply plug their health repeal and replace bill into last year's budget resolution, they would fall $350 billion short of balance by the end of their 10-year goal. And if further Medicaid savings are taken off the table, the gap is more like $500 billion. "It's going to be extremely difficult," admitted budget panel member Cole. U.S. temporarily bans larger electronics from cabins of certain flights Published: Tuesday, March 21, 2017 @ 3:07 AM By: Patrick McMahon, Rare.us Woman typing on laptop computer in commercial airplane (Jason Dewey / The Image Bank / Getty Images)(Jason Dewey/Getty Images) Jason Dewey/Getty Images A temporary ban on carry-on electronics is set to take effect Tuesday on certain flights into the U.S., according to reporting from The Hill and supported by tweets posted by Royal Jordanian Airlines. Those tweets have since been deleted but read, “Following instructions from the concerned U.S. departments, we kindly inform our dearest passengers departing to and arriving from the United States that carrying any electronic or electrical device on board the flight cabins is strictly prohibited,” according to The Hill. >> Read more trending news The ban will be formally announced Tuesday but is said to affect 13 countries for the next 96 hours and is a response to a specific intelligence threat, The Hill reported, citing Fox News. The ban reportedly has nothing to do with President Donald Trump’s travel ban, two versions of which have now been struck down by courts across the country. Affected countries, airlines and flights are in the process of being informed, CNN reported. The ban reportedly applies to all electronics except mobile phones and medical devices; items such as laptops, tablets and cameras may not be brought into the cabin but can fly in checked luggage. White House promotes satirical article praising Trump's new budget Published: Sunday, March 19, 2017 @ 2:34 AM By: Elizabeth Vale, Rare.us Talk about "fake news.”  The White House reportedly shared a story Friday that was written as satire.  This was in today's email from the White House. So clearly, literally no one read the linked piece by @petridishes, did they? pic.twitter.com/1cqoDbqgTg— Molly Templeton (@mollytempleton) March 17, 2017 According to the Daily Beast, a newsletter sent by President Donald Trump's administration featured a story by Washington Post columnist Alexandra Petri and headlined, “Trump’s budget makes perfect sense and will fix America, and I will tell you why.” >> Read more trending stories The column was labeled ComPost, so it’s unclear how the Trump administration staff took the article – which featured lines like “AMERICA WILL BE STRONGER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN!” (her emphasis) – seriously.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)(Evan Vucci/AP) Evan Vucci/AP Petri issued a comment to the Daily Beast, telling the publication, “I am honored to finally be real, true news, which is all I’ve ever striven for.” She added: “It goes to show that as long as you confirm what the Trump White House wants to believe, you, too, can be cited in an email – and you can even work for the mainstream media and do it!”  The columnist concluded her correspondence with the publication by saying that she “can’t stop laughing.” Petri also wrote a follow-up story for The Washington Post. In that story, “How the White House made me Real News,” she came to the conclusion that either White House officials “read it and loved it, especially the part where I wrote that all schoolchildren will be taught by an F-35 in a Make America Great Again hat, or they … did not read it but liked the headline.” The White House has yet to comment on the presumed mistake.

Trump fires off tweets slamming Russia allegations Published: Monday, March 20, 2017 @ 8:32 AM By: Hélène Vincent, Rare.us President Donald Trump fired off some angry tweets Monday morning regarding allegations that his campaign colluded with the Russian government during the 2016 election. >> Read more trending news The president defended himself and his campaign by reasserting that he has never colluded with Russia — not during his presidential bid and not after the election.

But that doesn't mean every stock is climbing. In fact, some of the best profit opportunities in the market can be found in the three top stocks to short, which are all dropping quickly. The recent rally for the Dow is part of a much longer rally for the index. In the past year alone the Dow is up almost 21%, and it's up 190% over its eight-year bull run. While the markets as a whole may be rising, the top stocks to short today that we're targeting have lost between 15% and 40% of their value in 2017 alone. And the dips won't stop there… The losses stem from systemic issues that will be extremely difficult to overcome. And it's not far-fetched to think these companies will eventually declare bankruptcy, driving share prices to $0. The first of the top stocks to short has been hanging on to "nostalgia" too long and has continually failed to innovate…. Stocks to Short No. 3: Avon Products Inc. (NYSE: AVP) "The company for women" was founded in 1886. Since then, the iconic slogan of "Avon calling" has become synonymous with the door-to-door sale of cosmetics. Despite an amazing history of helping women, Avon Products Inc.'s (NYSE: AVP) future is troubling. Surprisingly, one of the first trends that has led to Avon's demise is the increase of women entering the workforce. In 1950, only about 30% of women participated in the workforce. By 1990, about 60% of women worked outside of the home. Must See: This Great Depression-Era "Secret" Helped Transform Two Teachers into Millionaires. Read more… On the surface, women working should be good for a cosmetics company. The issue is twofold, though. First, women were not home during the day to answer the door when the Avon ladies made their rounds. The second issue is that door-to-door sales became less appealing as more opportunities for women became available. In fact, Avon saw a decline of 2% in active representatives just last quarter. Fewer sales representatives means lower revenue, which declined 2.4% last quarter. If that wasn't enough, Avon has also been facing increased competition. For starters, high-quality and affordable cosmetics are easy to find everywhere women shop these days. Drug stores, grocery stores, even Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT), all have a large selection of cosmetics. In these stores you can see the physical product before you buy. When you order from Avon, you either order online or from a catalog. High-end stores have been gaining in popularity for those who want a consultation and to try products before they buy. Ulta Beauty Inc. (Nasdaq: ULTA), MAC Cosmetics, and Sephora USA Inc. all have stores where you can try products. They also have knowledgeable staff that can help you make selections based on your skin type and preferences, something an Avon representative used to help with. The last part of the Avon model was convenience. You didn't need to leave your house to buy cosmetics. The representative came to you. These days the Internet has taken over the convenience market. In fact, 73% said Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN) was their number one destination for beauty products in a 2015 eMarketer survey. All of this has led to decreasing revenue and profit over the last five years. So in a last-ditch effort to regain profitability, Avon entered a restructuring deal with Cerberus Capital Management LP in December 2015. Cerberus specializes in investing in distressed companies. Having to make a deal with this company in order to get the cash you need is never a good thing. In the deal, Avon spun off its underperforming North American business. Avon then sold 80.1% of the business to Cerberus for $170 million. Despite unloading the underperforming arm of the business, Avon still has a lot going against it. Avon's international business (that the company owns the majority stake in) has been marred in controversy since 2008. The company has faced Chinese corruption charges, animal-testing allegations, and labor harassment accusations in Turkey. The once-iconic brand is falling hard. AVP stock has dropped 15.67% so far in 2017 and is currently trading at $4.28 per share. But we expect the stock to continue falling even further as punitive fines from the harassment accusations are levied. This next company to short continues to make headlines for its purportedly illegal business practices… Stocks to Short No. 2: Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (NYSE: VRX) Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (NYSE: VRX) is known for its questionable business practices. The company is notorious for buying smaller pharmaceutical companies (financed with debt), firing the staff of the newly acquired company, and dramatically raising prices of the new drugs at its disposal. Valeant has also been accused of defrauding insurers. This led to a criminal investigation in August 2016. The allegations pointed to close ties to Philidor Rx Services LLC, a mail-order pharmacy that has since gone under. Philidor worked on behalf of Valeant to persuade insurers to approve the higher-priced Valeant drugs over cheaper alternatives in exchange for kickbacks. By November 2016, charges were filed against Gary Tanner, a former executive of Valeant, and Andrew Davenport, the former CEO of Philidor. They were charged with federal wire fraud and money laundering. The media coverage of the investigations into Valeant's business practices, along with a push for generic drugs, caused a decline in sales and profit. In 2014, the company announced operating income of $2 billion. However, 2016 saw an operating loss of $566 million. This decline in profitability spells disaster when coupled with the ever-increasing debt load that will be subjected to higher interest rates when refinanced. The company's long-term debt has almost doubled between 2014 and 2016 from $15.229 billion to $29.846 billion. Declining profits are already putting pressure on this highly leveraged company. The fines that are sure to follow the criminal investigations may be the final nail in the coffin for Valeant. So far this year, VRX stock has declined 25% and currently trades for $10.98. It is likely the stock will continue to crumble as ex-executives are convicted of crimes and the U.S. Department of Justice issues fines for the company. While 25% is a large three-month decline, this next company is down almost 40% so far this year, and the losses show no sign of stopping… Join the conversation.

Pret-a-Reporter Fashion Week New York Fashion Week London Fashion Week Milan Fashion Week Paris Fashion Week Reviews Beauty Red Carpet Retail Report Subscribe Newsletters Facebook Twitter Instagram Tumblr The Hollywood Reporter Billboard Subscribe Newsletters Pret-a-Reporter Fashion Week New York Fashion Week London Fashion Week Milan Fashion Week Paris Fashion Week Reviews Beauty Red Carpet Retail Report Americans Were Cautious Spenders in February Despite Economic Optimism 11:47 AM PDT 3/15/2017 by Christopher Rugaber, Associated Press FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Leon Neal/Getty Images Compared to January, spending in February saw minimal growth. Americans spent only slightly more last month at retail stores compared with January, a sign of consumer caution despite rising optimism about the economy. The Commerce Department said Wednesday retail sales ticked up a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent in February, after a much bigger gain of 0.6 percent the previous month. January's gain was revised higher. The figures suggest that strong job gains this year, near record-high stock prices and decent pay gains haven't yet lifted spending. But last month's sluggish pace could prove temporary. Economists note that spending was likely held back by delays in tax refund payments. A new law has required tougher scrutiny of a tax credit claimed by lower-income taxpayers. Walmart said last month that the delay had slowed sales at its stores in February. Other retailers have reported similar concerns. Yet tax refunds have started to flow this month, which could trigger a rebound. Economists also were encouraged by the upward revisions to January's sales data, which point to potentially faster growth in the first three months of the year. A separate report showed inflation rose in February and is now comfortably above the Federal Reserve's target of 2 percent. The Fed is expected to announce its third rate hike in 15 months on Wednesday. "Inflation is trending gradually higher and underlying retail sales are healthy enough," said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. "Nothing here to suggest the Fed shouldn't raise interest rates at the FOMC meeting that concludes later today." Sales rose in February at furniture stores and home and garden centers. But they fell sharply at electronics and appliance stores. Sales also fell at gas stations, though that mostly reflects lower prices. Clothing stores, sporting goods retailers and department stores also all reported lower sales. There are several additional factors that could drive spending higher in the months ahead. Consumer confidence soared to its highest level in more than 15 years in February, according to the Conference Board, a business research group. Hiring and average hourly pay growth have picked up since the new year. Americans' finances are in better shape, with average home prices back to their pre-recession levels in much of the country. Yet the boost in confidence may not be broadly shared. That could limit any spending that might result. For Americans younger than age 35, who are less likely than older age groups to own a home or stocks, confidence actually fell last month. And the consumer confidence data has grown increasingly political in recent years, with Republicans reporting much greater optimism than Democrats. That reverses a pattern that emerged under former President Barack Obama. Retail sales make up about one-third of total consumer spending, with the other two-thirds consisting of healthcare and other services. Economists closely monitor spending, because it makes up about 70 percent of the economy. Growth has yet to catch up with the recent burst of optimism that has followed Donald Trump's election. The economy expanded at a modest 1.9 percent pace in the final three months of last year. Most economists expect it will grow at roughly a 2 percent pace in the January-March quarter.

To spy on executives, you don't need permission, Just filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a wise investor, you might pay attention To the buys and sells I'm about to mention. Elliott Management continues to accumulate shares in Arconic Inc. (ARNC) while it fights to oust Arconic's CEO. Following a buying spree in February, Elliott is the biggest shareholder in Arconic, owning about 13 percent of the company. Based in New York, Arconic is the raw-aluminum operation split off from Alcoa Inc. last November. It is one of this this year's best-performing stocks, up 44.7 percent through March 10. Elliott Management, one of the largest hedge fund organizations, has said it would put Larry Lawsen, formerly the CEO of Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc., in charge of Arconic. I made good money investing in Spirit AeroSystems in 2013-16, and I think Lawson would do a good job at Arconic. Spirit says if Lawson takes that job, he would be violating a non-compete clause. I doubt that Spirit will win that dispute. Even if it does, I still think Lawson will take the helm at Arconic if the dissidents win. Arconic's current CEO, Klaus Christian Kleinfeld, wants to stay on. He owns about $24.6 million in Arconic stock, $17.7 million in Alcoa and 2.4 million in Morgan Stanley shares. If he loses this proxy fight, he may be sad but he will not be broke. If I were an Arconic shareholder, I would be voting the “blue card” to bring the dissidents to power. International fragrances I'm not sure whether Elliott will experience any “buyer's remorse” if it captures Arconic. But I suspect that may happen with Winder Investment PTE's recent purchases in International Flavors and Fragrances Inc. (IFF). Winder is a private company is Singapore. I consider International Flavors a good company. But its revenue growth has slowed to less than 2 percent annually in recent years. Meanwhile, the stock reflects the company's excellent reputation. It sells for 23 times earnings and six times book value (corporate net worth per share). Winder has recently added 280,000 shares to its position in the company. It now owns 10.4 percent of the company, or 8.2 million shares. Up to now, Winder has said it intends to be a passive investor. Chesapeake Energy At Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK), director and former chairman Archie Dunham recently purchased 500,000 shares, bringing his holding to 4.6 million shares worth almost $24 million. For more than a decade, under former CEO Aubrey McClendon, Chesapeake was a grab-all-you-can acquirer of natural gas assets. In the process, it ran the company's total liabilities up to a peak of $26 billion in 2012. Chesapeake shares peaked at more than $62 in 2008, and have fallen to a little above $5 now. Today, Chesapeake's net worth is negative. It may pull out of the hole and is trying hard to do so under new management that is selling off assets and shrinking the company. Such stories often end badly, though, and I'm not optimistic here. Wal-Mart Members of the Walton family have sold more than $1 billion of stock in Wal-Mart Inc. (WMT) in February and March. Yet it scarcely puts a dent in the family's holdings. The Walton clan owns more than 50 percent of the company, which is valued at $215 billion. Revenue at the retail giant grew at less than 4 percent the past five years, and just over 4 percent last year. Track record This is the 41st column I've written about insider trades. I've tabulated the 12-month results for all columns written from the beginning of 1999 through March 2016. •Stocks that I recommended and that showed insider buying beat the Standard & Poor's 500 Index by 6.50 percentage points, on average. •Stocks that showed insider buying but that I said I would avoid have trailed the S&P 500 by more than 27 percentage points. •Stocks that showed buying but where I made no clear recommendation have beaten the index by 15.9 points. •Stocks where I commented on insider selling have trailed the index by 1.69 points. One year ago, I said I found Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) “attractive,” but recommended avoiding Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTX) and Boston Beer Co. (SAM). Bank of New York rose 30.8 percent. The other two fell 48.50 percent and 12.33 percent respectively. Bear in mind that my column recommendations are theoretical and don't reflect actual trades, trading costs or taxes. Their results shouldn't be confused with the performance of portfolios I manage for clients. And past performance doesn't predict future results.

Feldman Magazine Library of Congress Thurgood Marshall in the Supreme Courts lounge after successfully arguing a school integration case in 1958. Appointed to the Court himself in 1967, Marshall would take up the case against monopoly long championed by Justice Louis Brandeis, whose portrait hangs in the background. Donate Subscribe Share Tweet Print Email At the new National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., a hallway of glass display cases features more than a century of black entrepreneurial triumphs. In one is a World War II–era mini parachute manufactured by the black-owned Pacific Parachute Company, home to one of the nation’s first racially integrated production plants. Another displays a giant time clock from the R. H. Boyd Publishing Company, among the earliest firms to print materials for black churches and schools. Although small, the exhibit recalls a now largely forgotten legacy: by serving their communities when others wouldn’t, black-owned independent businesses provided avenues of upward mobility for generations of black Americans and supplied critical leadership and financial support for the civil rights movement. This tradition continues today. Last June, Black Enterprise magazine marked the forty-fourth anniversary of the BE 100s, the magazine’s annual ranking of the nation’s top 100 black-owned businesses. At the top of the list stood World Wide Technology, which, since its founding in 1990, has grown into a global firm with more than $7 billion in revenue and 3,000 employees. Then came companies like Radio One, whose fifty-five radio stations fan out among sixteen national markets. The combined revenues of the BE 100s, which also includes Oprah Winfrey’s Harpo Productions, now totals more than $24 billion, a ninefold increase since 1973, adjusting for inflation. A closer look at the numbers, however, reveals that these pioneering companies are the exception to a far more alarming trend. The last thirty years also have brought the wholesale collapse of black-owned independent businesses and financial institutions that once anchored black communities across the country. In 1985, sixty black-owned banks were providing financial services to their communities; today, just twenty-three remain. In eleven states that headquartered black-owned banks in 1994, not a single one is still in business. Of the fifty black-owned insurance companies that operated during the 1980s, today just two remain. Over the same period, tens of thousands of black-owned retail establishments and local service companies also have disappeared, having gone out of business or been acquired by larger companies. Reflecting these developments, working-age black Americans have become far less likely to be their own boss than in the 1990s. The per capita number of black employers, for example, declined by some 12 percent just between 1997 and 2014. What’s behind these trends, and what’s the implication for American society as a whole? To be sure, at least some of this entrepreneurial decline reflects positive economic developments. A slowly rising share of black Americans now hold white-collar salaried jobs and have more options for employment beyond running their own businesses. The movement of millions of black families to integrated suburbs over the last forty years also is a welcome trend, even if one effect has been to weaken the viability of the many black-owned independent businesses left behind in historically black neighborhoods. But the decline in entrepreneurship and business ownership among black Americans also is cause for concern. One reason is that it largely reflects not the opening of new avenues of upward mobility, but rather the foreclosing of opportunity. Rates of business ownership and entrepreneurship are falling among black citizens for much the same reason they are declining among whites and Latinos. As large retailers and financial institutions comprise an ever-bigger slice of the national economy, the possibility of starting and maintaining an independent business has dropped. The Washington Monthly has addressed the role of market concentration in suppressing opportunity and in displacing local economies in depth (see, for example, “The Slow-Motion Collapse of American Entrepreneurship,” July/August 2012, and “Bloom and Bust,” November/December 2015). Other studies, including a report published last year by President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisors, have substantiated these developments. The role of market concentration in depressing black-owned businesses is also troubling because of the critical role that such enterprises have played in organizing and financing the struggle for civil rights in America. In the 1950s and ’60s, black Americans employed by whites, including professionals like teachers, often faced dismissal if they joined the civil rights movement, whereas those who owned their own independent business had much greater freedom to resist. This is a largely forgotten history, but one that is gaining new urgency for all Americans in the age of Donald Trump. It shows the crucial way in which advancing and protecting basic civil rights can depend not only on moral and physical courage, but also on possessing the economic independence to stand up to concentrated power. The decline of black-owned independent businesses traces to many causes, but a major one that has been little noted was the decline in the enforcement of anti-monopoly and fair trade laws beginning in the late 1970s. Under both Democratic and Republican administrations, a few firms that in previous decades would never have been allowed to merge or grow so large came to dominate almost every sector of the economy. This change has hurt all independent businesses, but the effects have disproportionately hit black business owners. Marcellus Andrews, Bucknell University professor of economics, says that pulling back on anti-monopoly enforcement was a “catastrophic intellectual and political policy mistake,” and that for the black community, the “presumed price advantages of concentration often do not translate into better economic opportunities.” A case in point is the decline of black-owned financial institutions, including banks and insurance companies. “Mainstream insurers went after black insurance companies for their top personnel to sell their products,” says Wichita State professor Robert Weems Jr. When MetLife bought United Mutual Life Insurance Company in 1993, this was the end of the sixty-three-year existence of the last black-owned insurance company in the Northeast. Black Enterprise called the 1990s “a virtual bloodbath” for the black insurance industry, noting that from 1989 to 1999, the number of black-owned insurers declined by 68 percent. Parks Sausage—which many readers of a certain age may remember for its jingle “More Parks Sausages, Mom, please”—also serves as an example of how market concentration led to the decline of black-owned independent businesses. Founded in 1951 by Henry Parks Jr., the Baltimore-based company grew into a multimillion-dollar operation, selling pork products from New England to Virginia. In 1969, Parks took the company public, making the 200-employee firm the first black-owned business on the New York Stock Exchange. Yet by the 1990s, after a turbulent series of ownership changes, the company had fallen into bankruptcy. In 1996, two black Americans, the former football stars Franco Harris and Lydell Mitchell, attempted to revive the company, but faced an increasingly consolidated meatpacking industry in which the four largest meatpackers controlled 78 percent of the market. As Harris put it, before selling out, “it’s been hard to get distribution.” Much the same story occurs with black-owned grocers. In 1969, J. Bruce Llewellyn grew ten Bronx supermarkets into the nation’s largest minority-owned retail business. By the 1990s, however, a retreat from antitrust enforcement and other fair trade laws permitted a few giant corporations like Walmart to engage in anticompetitive behaviors that in previous decades would have resulted in civil and criminal prosecution. These included undermining the pricing power of suppliers and loss leading, or the practice of selling below cost in order to drive competitors out of business. In 1999, Llewellyn sold his last remaining stores to the Dayton-Hudson Corporation, now known as the Target Corporation. In 1986, a top executive at Revlon made a prediction about the future of the beauty and hair care industry. “In the next couple of years,” he told Newsweek, “the black-owned businesses will disappear. They’ll all be sold to white companies.” The prediction proved accurate. In 1993, IVAX Corp. purchased Johnson Products Co., the thirty-nine-year-old maker of Ultra Sheen, beginning a decade-long series of acquisitions that wiped out remaining black ownership in the hair care industry. One consequence was fewer new hair care products for black customers. Funds once channeled into research and development, University at Buffalo professor Robert Mark Silverman explains, now were accrued as profits by the larger firms. Much the same has happened to black-owned firms in the entertainment, communications, and publishing sectors. In response to the merger wave, the founder of Black Entertainment Television, Robert Johnson, told an audience at an investment conference in 1997, “You cannot get big anymore by being 100 percent black-owned anything.” Four years later, Viacom bought out BET for $2.34 billion. In 2005, Time Warner acquired Essence Communications Partners, the publisher of the then-leading black women’s magazine, Essence. Meanwhile, “small enterprises,” writes the business scholar John Sibley Butler, “could not compete with the expansion of larger retail chains, shopping malls, and franchises which developed.” Black-owned funeral homes are a prime example. During the civil rights era, writes author Suzanne Smith in her book To Serve the Living, “funeral directors were usually among the few black individuals in any town or city who were economically independent and not beholden to the local white power structure.” Yet, today, black-owned independent funeral homes are an imperiled institution, as national chains like Service Corporation International muscle out more and more businesses. Charlotte Clark, a black funeral home owner in Roanoke, Alabama, explains that these companies “buy local folks’ funeral parlors but leave up the signs and play it off like there’s been no change, but call the shots from elsewhere.” The National Funeral Directors and Morticians Association, which represents black funeral directors, has seen its membership decrease by 40 percent since 1997. Reflecting on the past three decades, Bob Dickerson, CEO of the Birmingham Business Resource Center in Alabama, says, “Had our institutions and businesses been maintained, had that money been plowed back into our communities, it could have meant a world of difference.” The role of market concentration in driving down the number of black-owned independent businesses becomes all the more concerning when one considers some mostly forgotten history. In principles, people, and tactics, the fight for black civil rights, going back to before the Civil War, was often deeply intertwined and aligned with America’s anti-monopoly traditions. An early example is the Free Soil Party. Emerging in the 1840s, its members opposed slavery on moral grounds. They also opposed all forms of monopoly power as a threat to liberty, including its most terrible manifestation: the monopoly of slave owners over slaves. Marching under the banner of “Free Soil, Free Speech, Free Labor, and Free Men,” the movement focused on granting equal citizenship to all Americans, in large part by promoting the then-radical idea of giving black freedmen and slaves the right to own the land on which they labored. Courtesy Black Enterprise No more Parks Sausages: Former National Football League star Franco Harris made the cover of Black Enterprise magazine in 1996 when he tried to rescue the first black-owned business listed on the New York Stock Exchange. A rapidly monopolizing meat processing industry doomed the effort. Free Soilers proposed breaking up land monopolies and dividing western lands into 50-to-100-acre homesteads that would grant white and black families independence. As the antebellum history scholar Jonathan Earle explains, “Opponents of aristocracy, land monopoly, and slavery saw yeoman farming and inalienable landownership as the true opposites of servitude.” It was therefore no surprise when Helen Douglass, the wife of the Free Soiler and abolitionist Frederick Douglass, wrote that his opposition against any type of coercion “not only made him a foe to American slavery, but also to all forms of monopoly.” After the Civil War, passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, which outlawed racially discriminatory laws like the Black Codes, depended in no small part on white supporters who saw it as a means of prohibiting all grants of monopoly or class privilege. An 1866 article in the Boston Daily Advertiser said it “[threw] the same shield over the black man as over the white, over the humble as over the powerful.” In fact, one of the earliest applications of the law was by a group of independent Louisiana butchers who argued that a state-sanctioned twenty-five-year slaughterhouse monopoly violated the Fourteenth Amendment. During Reconstruction, the relationship between black political enfranchisement and economic independence gained strength. Abolitionists in Congress passed the Southern Homestead Act, which promised to replace the monopoly of slavery with the creation of a black yeomanry secured with grants of free land. Like General William Tecumseh Sherman’s Special Field Order No. 15, with its promise of “forty acres of tillable ground” to newly freed slaves, it fell victim to white backlash and sectional compromise, and was rescinded. Nevertheless, by the 1890s, black Americans who owned or aspired to own their own land joined with independent white farmers in the multiracial Populist Party, in states including Georgia and Texas. Library of Congress Keeping it in the community: During the mid-twentieth century, anti-monopoly laws, particularly fair trade legislation, contributed to an increase in the number of black-owned, independent businesses like this one in Harlem. The natural alliance between supporters of black civil rights and opponents of monopoly, though strained by race-baiting demagogues, especially during the darkest days of Jim Crow, would endure. As a 1913 editorial by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) put it, the Emancipation Proclamation and the legacy of the Free Soil movement “gave black men not simply physical freedom, but it attempted to give them political freedom and economic freedom and social freedom. It knew then, as it knows now, that no people can be free unless they have the right to vote, the right to land and capital, and the right to choose their friends.” To be sure, many black leaders during this era recognized that economic independence was a necessary but not sufficient condition for securing full rights as citizens. Unlike their white counterparts, independent black business owners were vulnerable to the brutality of lynching, to voter suppression at the polls, and to the plundering of black business districts by white supremacists. Yet many black leaders nonetheless saw that the fight for racial justice also required expanded economic independence, which in turn depended on containing market concentration. In the early twentieth century, groups like the National Negro Business League, for instance, supported anti–chain store legislation as a way to preserve black Americans’ economic self-sufficiency and freedom. As an editorial in the black newspaper New Journal and Guide bemoaned, “Chain stores are constantly draining every dollar, every week, from all of our Southern communities . . . never putting any of it back so that the communities can use it again.” Indeed, many black leaders supported these laws, even though the Ku Klux Klan and many racist white populists also championed them for their own reasons. In 1928, W. E. B. Du Bois validated the black community’s embrace of anti-monopolism when he wrote, “To ask the individual colored man . . . to sell meat, shoes, candy, books, cigars, clothes or fruit in competition with the chain store, is to ask him to commit slow but almost inevitable economic suicide.” In 1932, the Associated Negro Press and the National Negro Business League, with the cooperation of the U.S. Department of Commerce, printed a newspaper column called “Business and Industry.” One article in the series noted that “an embarrassing problem confronts the 70,000 or more Negro-owned individual enterprises in the U.S. today[:] . . . Big Business, which so perceptibly handicaps the small industrial business units in which category Negro enterprise unquestionably belongs.” Coming into the New Deal era, the federal government adopted many policies that enormously benefited whites but did little or nothing to help black Americans. The Federal Housing Authority engaged in redlining, the destructive practice of refusing to issue mortgages in predominately black neighborhoods. The Wagner Act left black workers still unable to join unions. Black agricultural and domestic laborers couldn’t reap the benefits of Social Security. “Roosevelt’s New Deal,” Ta-Nehisi Coates has argued, “rested on the foundation of Jim Crow.” But the expansion of anti-monopoly laws that also occurred during this period provided one important exception to this pattern. These measures included stepped-up antitrust enforcement, along with new fair trade laws, like the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936 and the Miller-Tydings Act of 1937, that prevented dominant firms from exploiting their market power. Combined with anti–chain store measures passed in twenty-seven states, the new legal and regulatory constraints on market concentration benefited independent enterprise, including black-owned independent businesses. Between 1935 to 1939 the number of black-owned retail stores increased by 31 percent and the number of black employees hired by black-owned retail stores grew by 14.5 percent. Into the 1940s, black leaders battled segregation while continuing to advocate for anti-monopoly laws. In August 1941, the student organization Negro Youth published a list of demands from the National Defense Program, including “that the Attorney General investigate and prosecute all violations of the Sherman Antitrust laws.” In response to a 1947 New York fair trade law that prohibited loss leading, a coalition of black wholesale grocers declared that the law “will afford additional protection to the small businessman, be he Negro or white.” Independent business owners also played a key role in financing civil rights protests, especially during their peak in the 1950s and ’60s. In Tallahassee, black grocery store owner Daniel Speed bankrolled a bus boycott similar to that in Montgomery, and his shop served as a meeting ground for black leaders. In Biloxi, Gilbert R. Mason, owner of Modern Drug Store, led a “wade-in” against the whites-only section of a federally funded Gulf Coast beach. In his autobiography, Mason wrote, “Pharmacists represented an economically independent class of black businessmen who might have been thought difficult for the white establishment to control. In many cases, the black-owned pharmacy was itself a nexus in black communities.” Funeral home owners emerged as another powerful bloc of civil rights activists. In 1956, funeral home owner William Shortridge cofounded the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights, a group that sought to end employment discrimination and abolish segregation in public accommodations. A. G. Gaston, who built his business empire as the owner of the Smith and Gaston Funeral Home, threatened to transfer his accounts from a white-owned bank unless it removed a “Whites Only” sign from a water fountain. In 1963, he lent Martin Luther King Jr. a room at his Gaston Motel. Soon known as the “War Room,” it was there that King decided to submit himself to arrest in Birmingham, a galvanizing moment in the civil rights movement. King himself connected part of the civil rights movement with the struggle against market concentration. While giving a talk in 1961 to students at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, King drew parallels between the Sherman Antitrust Act and discrimination in public accommodations, noting, “This is what is said in the Sherman [Antitrust] Act, that if a business is in the public market it cannot deny access . . . [a]nd I think the same thing applies here . . . that a man should not have the right to say on the basis of color or religion, one cannot use a lunch counter that is open to everyone else in another racial group but not to these particular people; he has an obligation to the public.” In this era, support for the civil rights movement and opposition to monopoly were political stands often advocated by the same person. For instance, Justice Felix Frankfurter, who made anti-monopoly policy one of the causes of his life, served on the NAACP’s National Legal Committee while also being the first member of the Supreme Court to hire a black law clerk. New York Representative Emanuel Celler sponsored the Celler-Kefauver Act of 1950, a major anti-monopoly law, and also introduced the Civil Rights Act in the House. Sargent Shriver, the architect of Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty program, said at a dinner reception describing his vision for anti-discrimination laws and programs like Head Start, VISTA, and Job Corps, “The day may well come when Congress enacts a new Sherman Act for the social field—an antitrust law to ensure that . . . monopoly power is not used to expand and perpetuate itself.” Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy similarly drew a link between civil rights and anti-monopoly policy. “The principles of free enterprise which the antitrust laws are designed to protect and vindicate,” he said in 1961, “are economic ideals that underlie the whole structure of a free society.” Two years later, King, in his sermon “On Being a Good Neighbor,” echoed Kennedy’s vision when he said, “Our unswerving devotion to monopoly capitalism makes us concerned about the economic security of the captains of industry, and not the laboring men whose sweat and skills keep the wheels of industry rolling.” Black Americans employed by whites, including professionals like teachers, often faced dismissal if they joined the civil rights movement, whereas those who owned their own independent business had much greater freedom to resist.A seminal moment in the history of the civil rights movement came on a bloody Sunday in 1965 when Alabama state troopers attacked John Lewis and hundreds of others marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in support of voting rights. Here, too, the important link between black-owned independent businesses and civil rights was operating behind the scenes. Civil rights leader Amelia Boynton and her husband, Sam, for example, dedicated half the office space of their real estate and insurance company in Selma to host organizers from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee founder Bernard LaFayette also set up an office in Selma because he knew that the black commercial class would provide a measure of protection for activists. Betty Boynton, the wife of Sam and Amelia’s son Bruce, explained in an interview, “School administrators fired teachers and workers who were sympathetic to the movement.” Indeed, one of the reasons so much of the activity of the civil rights movement was centered in Selma is that its strong community of black business owners offered critical logistical, financial, and other forms of support. The link between civil rights and anti-monopoly policy also was a matter of tactics. In 1961, the owners of ten independent medical practices used the Sherman Antitrust Act against sixty-one local hospitals and medical organizations in Chicago that barred black Americans from the medical staff. The suit claimed that the hospitals, which provided more than 75 percent of the city’s private hospital beds, discriminated against black physicians. The settlement slowly helped integrate black citizens into the medical profession. In 1964, Reginald Johnson, secretary of the National Urban League, encouraged the use of antitrust laws to break up housing segregation in the nation’s cities. Of the twenty million dwellings built since World War II, only 3 percent had been open to black families. “Widespread conspiracies in flagrant restraint of trade,” Johnson said, “have confined millions of the nation’s Negro citizens to lives of squalor, misery, and privation.” Antitrust actions taken by the American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and other organizations helped force desegregation of neighborhoods and realty boards in cities including Trenton, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Akron, and New York City. Bruce Boynton even sought to join the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division to combat discrimination and fight for greater equality. In a 1964 interview with Jet he said, “I purposely picked Antitrust instead of the Civil Rights section because we have to get involved in other areas, too. . . . Negroes have to learn how to operate stores, as well as boycott them.” He never made it to the Justice Department but made history anyway. The Alabama Bar Association refused to grant him his law license because of his previous arrest for refusing to leave a “Whites Only” lunch counter. Boynton’s protest led to the Supreme Court case Boynton v. Virginia, which helped desegregate interstate bus travel. NAACP lawyer Thurgood Marshall, who was already famous for having successfully argued Brown v. Board of Education, represented Boynton in that case. As it happens, Marshall later became the nation’s first black Supreme Court justice and one of the Court’s last great defenders of anti-monopoly laws. Marshall grew up in the largely middle-class Druid Hill neighborhood of Baltimore, the grandson of two grocery owners, and as a young boy worked in their stores. Marshall’s philosophy, his biographer Juan Williams writes, “was the result of being the child of a proud, politically active, black, middle-class family that owned successful businesses and lived in an integrated neighborhood.” His greatest defense of the anti-monopoly vision came in the majority opinion he authored in United States v. Topco Associates, in which he argued that “antitrust laws, in general, and the Sherman Act, in particular, are the Magna Carta of free enterprise.” After the late 1970s, both Democrats and Republicans generally retreated from the long-standing tradition of using anti-monopoly laws to foster economic and political equality. Since then, successive administrations have evaluated mergers only for their “efficiency,” and by and large have resisted antitrust actions except in the most egregious instances of collusion and price fixing. The subsequent three decades of merger mania have brought steep increases in both market concentration and inequality. Some members of the black community applauded these changes. In a 1986 interview, Dr. William Bradford, chairman of the University of Maryland Finance Department, said, “Selling out will result in gaining future expansion opportunities. . . . [Black businesses] will move up the hierarchy and control more resources.” But other voices expressed worry. An editorial in the Atlanta Daily World noted, “Mergers don’t always make for better service or lower prices to the consumer, and one certain result of weakening the antitrust laws is more and more mergers.” Indeed, the number of mergers did keep growing, and in most instances involved smaller black-owned companies being bought out by larger firms controlled by whites. In 1988, MCA and Boston Ventures bought Motown Records for $61 million. In 1995, Shorebank Corporation acquired Chicago’s black-owned Drexel Bank. In 1999, the French advertising giant Publicis Groupe acquired 49 percent of the black-owned marketing firm Burrell Communications Group. In 2005, a group of white investors purchased the nation’s oldest black-owned bank, Consolidated Bank & Trust Co. The process continues today. Indeed, one of the legacies of Obama’s economic policies has been a particularly sharp drop in the number of black-owned banks. This is not only the result of lessened enforcement of the anti-monopoly laws but also an unintended side effect of measures like the Dodd-Frank Act. In the process of attempting to keep big banks from failing, Dodd-Frank created regulatory burdens that small banks could not meet. These policy changes contributed to a 14 percent decrease in the number of community banks between 2010 and late 2014. Particularly hard hit were black-owned banks, which decreased by 24 percent during this period. Black-owned financial institutions and the businesses that depend on them for credit were also deeply damaged by the misallocation of bank bailout funds. Referring to the government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), former Atlanta banker George Andrews says, “If there ever was a crime committed to our community it was in the way the government handled TARP funds.” According to a 2013 study of TARP investments, black-owned banks were ten times less likely to receive bailout money than nonminority-owned banks. Black Americans suffered disproportionately from the predatory lending practices of big banks and from the reform measures put in place to contain banks that had become too big to fail. The story of how the struggle for civil rights intertwined and intersected historically with the struggle against monopoly provides a lesson for the future. It suggests that going forward we also should consider how political independence connects with economic independence in the struggle for social justice. Without freedom from domination in one sphere, there is no freedom in the other. Allowing the powerful to corner markets erodes the democratic spirit that makes America great. Brian S.

Ogg March 14, 2017 9:05 am EDT Print Email Tweet Stocks were indicated to open lower on Tuesday while a massive blizzard is disrupting the northeastern United States. All eyes remain on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) ahead of this week’s interest rate hike decision, and the odds favor a hike. Even with the bull market now eight years old, investors have bought stocks on every pullback. Those same investors are also looking for new trading and investing ideas. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each day of the week. The goal is to find new investing ideas and trading ideas for our readers. Some analyst reports cover stocks to buy, while others cover stocks to sell or to avoid. Some color has been added on many of the following calls, and the consensus analyst price targets referenced are from Thomson Reuters. These are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Tuesday, March 14, 2017: Mobileye N.V.

Mobileye was downgraded to Hold from Buy at Jefferies and to Sector Perform from Outperform at RBC. Dougherty lowered its rating to Sell as a result of the buyout. Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: OXY) was raised to Outperform from Neutral at Credit Suisse, and the price target was raised to $79 from $77 (versus a $62.88 prior close). Occidental has a consensus analyst target price of $75.00, and it has a 52-week trading range of $61.01 to $78.48.

(NYSE: ORCL) was reiterated as Buy with a $48 price target (versus a $42.58 close) at Merrill Lynch. This was just a day after a more cautious call from a competing firm. Merrill Lynch sees Oracle’s business as poised for an inflection point to potentially deliver mid-single-digit software revenue growth and operating income going forward. Walt Disney Co.

Many of retail's most iconic department stores are struggling to survive at a time when a growing number of consumers are choosing the ease of shopping online at Amazon, or gravitating toward the discounts and all-in-one shopping experience available at big box giants like Walmart. Sears announced in January that it would close 150 stores and sell its Craftsman tool brand, while Macy's closed 66 locations in its last fiscal year and is planning to close another 34. Neiman Marcus may already have a potential buyer. Canadian company Hudson's Bay which had reportedly been considering a merger with Macy's, is now interested in acquiring Neiman Marcus instead, according to CNBC which cited sources who spoke to Dow Jones.   Hudson's Bay had been trying to secure funding to potentially purchase Macy's according to previous reports. But investors were hesitant about a deal that would anchor them in shopping malls which are seeing declining foot traffic. Now, Hudson's Bay is reportedly turning its attention to Neiman Marcus, which it would like to buy minus its $5 billion in debt, according to the CNBC report. Neiman Marcus, which was purchased in 2013 by Ares Management and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, planned an initial public offering two years later to help pay down its $4.9 billion in debt, according to Reorg Research. But Neiman's owners formally withdrew its bid to go public in January, says Reorg.    More On: USA Today Neiman Marcus Hudson's Bay Company Macy's Inc Share this Article Join the Conversation Top Business Stories business & markets Charlie Baker rejects rail cuts matt stout business & markets Standard Life and Aberdeen agree on terms for merger associated press business & markets Officials say Green Line in need of fed, state money dan atkinson business & markets The Ticker herald staff Trending Now NFL: Tom Brady's jersey was stolen by international media member Robichaud: Why does AG need another $3M?

He has famously refused to reveal his tax returns that would identify his actual net worth, but has claimed it’s “in excess” of $10 billion. Bill Gates now resides at the top of the list.

Penney may be on the chopping block CNBC0:47 UP NEXT Amazon.com likes to change the rules. First, it started selling books online. Then it launched an online shopping revolution. When it started the subscription service Amazon Prime, customers received two-day shipments for free. Each innovation caused a paradigm shift in how we shop and entertain ourselves.

Walmart has definitely taken aim. More than 65 million people were actively enrolled in Amazon Prime last year, paying $10.99 per month or $99 per year. Many customers use their accounts for free shipping, but they don’t realize that other terrific benefits exist as well. Here are nine Prime perks that you may not be using. Free same-day delivery It sounds too good to be true: You order an item, and someone hand-delivers the package within a few hours. How is this possible? Amazon Prime Now usually works like this. You can order a product by noon and expect to receive it by 9 p.m, sometimes even within an hour. It's only available in some cities and towns.  Learn more about same-day delivery. Share benefits with others There you were, enjoying the rewards of an Amazon Prime membership. Then you moved in with your significant other, who also orders a lot of stuff online. You can share the same Prime Membership with two other adults in the same household. To share your Amazon Prime membership, go to Account Settings >> Manage Your Content and Devices >> Settings >> Holds and Family Library >> Invite Adult. Tip in a Tip: Shopping on Amazon the right way is more than clicking items and loading up your cart. Once you learn a few tricks, you’ll find sales and price cuts that you never imagined possible. Watch streaming video Amazon Studios gained global attention at the 2017 Academy Awards when Casey Affleck won Best Actor for “Manchester by the Sea.” Like Netflix and Hulu, Amazon is producing a wide range of high-quality programs, and critics are giving the retail giant a big thumb’s up. However, Amazon also offers a colossal library of movies and TV series, from HBO flagships like “The Wire” to indie films like “The Lobster.” Keep in mind, not every flick or episode is available for free, but you can easily buy or order a streaming version of almost any movie imaginable. You can also download certain titles to watch offline. Here are the steps on how to do this. Download free music Many people enjoy their first year of Prime membership without ever knowing they can download music for free. That’s right: download. Yes, you can also stream songs, the same way you stream music on Apple Music, Spotify, and Pandora, but you can also choose from more than a million mp3s to keep forever on your phone or computer. The Prime Music app is also a handy tool. You can upload your own music library and listen to your songs wherever you go. Read free books and magazines Amazon started as an online bookstore, so it’s no wonder that the mega-store would nod to its roots with free volumes on Kindle. Amazon Prime reading offers you a trove of ebooks, comics, and magazines, which you can download at no charge to pretty much any device. The service works just like Prime Video, where the selections rotate regularly. So if the book you want to read isn’t there now, it maybe become available in a few months. Just download the Kindle app and you should ready to read. Verbophiles can even use the built-in dictionary to look up unfamiliar words. Use special cloud storage The truth is scary: Many people still don’t back up their hard drives. These folks are always one man-made or natural disaster away from losing all their pictures, music, videos, and documents. If you don’t already have a dependable storage service but you do have a Prime membership, you can use Amazon’s handy Cloud Drive, which gives members 5GB of storage for music and videos. Even better: You can use Amazon Prints to turn some of those stored photos into beautiful, frame-worthy images. Find out how to print high-quality photos for cheap. Order food and domestic goods Imagine walking into a supermarket, picking up a box, and filling it with 45 pounds of groceries. Okay, now imagine that you don’t even visit the supermarket, but someone deliveries this box directly to your door. Sound fantastic? Well, that’s basically what Amazon Pantry does. For $5.99, Amazon will ship a box of individual household items you select, up to 45 pounds. The service is still working out its kinks, so you won’t find the same selection you’d find at your local Super Target. But the idea is catching on, and many customers appreciate its versatility. Prime membership grants you access to a wider array of products. If you like the service, you can also subscribe to Amazon Family for $99, which gets you some extra perks, such as discounts on diapers. Get a discount on games Diehard gamers love to be the first to nab a new release. Amazon Prime members get a 20% discount on video game pre-orders and new releases. This applies to any game that has hit the market within two weeks of ordering. Just keep in mind that it only applies to physical copies of the game, and it doesn’t include console game bundles. Get restaurant meals delivered to your door Just when you thought DoorDash was a wild innovation, Amazon created its own dining delivery service: Just visit Amazon Restaurants and order a multi-course meal. Granted, you have to live in a city where Amazon Prime Now already exists. But if you do, you’re guaranteed to receive your steaming entrée within an hour!

After 41 years of operating Record Rack, owner Pat Strachota will be retiring this spring. "I thank my loyal customers for being such good customers over all the years," Strachota, 67, told The Commercial (http://bit.ly/2nsMBVj ). "They are the ones who made Record Rack Record Rack. ... I am going to hop on my motorcycle and ride. No destinations set. Just to see a sunset and a sunrise." Record Rack sells compact discs, cassette tapes, records, eight-tracks, Greek sorority and fraternity clothing, hookahs, biker gear, swimwear, black and strobe lights, skateboards, autographed guitars, e-cigarettes, lingerie, adult novelties, DVDs, spices, stones and candles. "I want to do what I want to do whenever I want to do it right now," Strachota said. "I live on a small farm. I've got a lot of work I need to do around there. My girlfriend has a lot of 'honey-do's' for me to do." He is looking for a buyer on a cash deal and has been hearing from one or two prospective buyers each week. He said he has no plans to finance such a transaction. In the meantime, he is offering sales and expects his regular customers to take advantage. If he does not sell his store, he expects to close by the end of April. "If I have a lot of stuff remaining, I may ask my landlord if I can stay until May," Strachota said. The advent of MP3 technology has impacted Record Rack, but not greatly because Strachota sells a broad assortment of merchandise. Besides the merchandise in the store, he has 17,000 DVDs in a warehouse on his farm. Vicki Hughes and her fiance David Green, both 48, have shopped and browsed at Record Rack for more than 30 years. Hughes smiled while recalling her shopping at the store "probably every pay day." "It's always been if you want to find really good music you're not going to find it at Walmart," Hughes said. "You're going to find it here. That's the norm. A lot of people my age come to Record Rack before they go to Walmart." Hughes hopes Strachota finds someone to buy his store. Green was shopping for a Kid Rock album and whatever else caught his eye. "It's sad because Record Rack has been here for a lot of years," Green said. "I hate to see it go because this has been a staple for as long as I can remember. I was born and raised here. There comes a time and a place you have to move on to other things." Alia Reeves shopped for Greek organization paraphernalia Wednesday and has been a customer since 1990. She is going to miss shopping at the store. "You can't find anything anywhere else except if you go out of town to Little Rock," Reeves, a Pine Bluff resident, said. "I like patronizing my own city. ... The Record Rack was the popping place for us as teenagers to get our records." Pat Strachota keeps a framed portrait of his late son U.S. Army Sgt. Michael Strachota inside his store. Michael Strachota died serving in Afghanistan in 2012. As retirement beckons, Pat Strachota will visit his grandson in San Antonio, Texas, and enjoy not being constrained to a schedule. ___ Information from: Pine Bluff Commercial, http://www.pbcommercial.com An AP Member Exchange shared by The Commercial.

LOUIS — A man found dead inside a burned home in southern Illinois had been shot in the head, and a gun was found in his ex-wife’s SUV after she drove into a nearby lake and died shortly after the fire was reported, authorities said Friday. The pair’s infant son was pulled from the submerged SUV by a paramedic who swam through frigid water, quickly realized a baby and not a doll was floating inside, and performed CPR on the boy atop the vehicle’s roof. Six other children safely escaped the Thursday fire at the house, where the divorced parents — who had a history of domestic violence — both lived. Preliminary autopsy results released Friday show 37-year-old Justin Campbell died from the gunshot wound. But testing can’t be done to determine whether the gun found in Cristy Campbell’s SUV was used to shoot Campbell because the bullet that struck him hasn’t been found, according to Madison County Coroner Steve Nonn. Nonn later told The Associated Press that nothing in the investigation or autopsy suggests the gunshot wound was self-inflected. Police said the tangled chain of events began when some of the children ran to a Walmart store near their home around 5:15 a.m. Thursday in Glen Carbon, Ill. They told an arriving worker to call 911 because their house was on fire. Responding firefighters found Justin Campbell’s body. About 16 minutes later, a motorist called 911 after seeing an SUV travel down a hill and into Silver Lake in Highland, about 16 miles away from the house. Paramedics Todd Zobrist and Ty Barr arrived minutes later. Zobrist said he could see headlights in the water and knew there might be someone inside the SUV, which was submerged in about five feet of water. He stripped off his shirt, socks and boots, and swam 75 feet to the vehicle. “When I got halfway there I was thoroughly thinking to myself, ’This is a terrible decision and I really need to just turn around and go back to the dock because I’m going to get myself in a lot of trouble,”’ Zobrist said at a news conference Friday. “At that point, though, I was committed, I was already wet, I was already cold.” Dark outside and difficult to see, he found the only access inside the vehicle was through an open driver’s side window. Zobrist peered into the back seat — and saw something. “It looked like two feet and two hands,” he said. “And at first I thought it was just a doll, a kid’s toy of some sort.” It was three-month-old Julian Campbell, alone and floating inside the SUV with about 8 inches of air space. Zobrist pulled the unresponsive infant out the window and began CPR on the SUV’s roof. Once the baby spit out water and began breathing, Zobrist, his muscles aching from the cold, called back to his partner to see if firefighters with a boat and wetsuits were coming. But the team was delayed by a train blocking access to the lake, so Zobrist swam back to shore with the baby in one arm. The baby was hospitalized and expected to recover. Zobrist, who has two young sons of his own, was treated for hypothermia in an emergency room but said he was fine. He shied away from any talk about his heroics. “It was just right place, right time,” he said. Cristy Campbell’s body was found hours later in the lake. Preliminary autopsy results determined she died of “environmental exposure and drowning,” Nonn said. The Illinois State Fire Marshal’s office is investigating the cause of the fire. The Campbells had a volatile history but were living together with their children, said Capt. Mike Dixon of the Madison County Sheriff’s Department. Before they married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse in 2005. He was accused of attacking Cristy Campbell, known then as Cristy Brueggemann, when she was pregnant by slapping her in the head. He was sentenced in March 2006 to probation and fined $500. Despite the violence, they wed on Nov. 3, 2006. She filed for legal separation in September 2010, but the matter was dismissed two months later. In April 2012, Cristy Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce. She alleged in court papers that he “abuses me on a weekly basis,” including punching and choking her. “He has told me that I’m a no good wife,” Campbell wrote in her application for the protection order. The divorce was granted in February 2013. Glen Carbon police have answered around 50 calls to the Campbell home, including some “domestic-related situations,” Madison County Sheriff John Lakin said. He declined to elaborate. Authorities said the children are with Illinois authorities and will be placed with relatives.

Hot Topics: School Tax Request Studied Fed Budget Cuts FoCoMx Lineup Lightning Hybrids & Ford Connor Medbery finishes 2nd Entertainment This Week RH Line Horse Rescued Police Calls Lady Luck both smiles and frowns By Mike Foley Posted:   03/17/2017 07:35:22 PM MDT Just a day or so ago, possibly you, and a few of my genetically and non-genetically connected acquaintances, celebrated our Irish-ness, or imaginary Irish connection to the Emerald Isle. There was a time, maybe not so long ago, that being Irish wasn't something to brag about — not even on St. Patrick's Day. But, I'm not here to get involved in that subject, no, to the contrary, I want to tell you of my attempts to be lucky. I have had a few bright spots, i.e. one afternoon, while walking home from our rural schoolhouse in Reno, Nevada, I nearly tripped over a little red coin purse someone had dropped. There were a few coins inside, probably less than a dollar's worth, and nothing else. I had just stumbled upon a windfall. As has become my habit when given free money, I spent it. Well, there wasn't a nearby Wal-Mart, just an old gas station, with its limited supply of desirables. Unless I craved a radiator hose for a 1937 Cord, about all they had was a Coke machine. I trudged home with a half dozen bottles of Coke. A 6-year-old with a six-pack. Lady Luck smiled. It wasn't too long after, that my older brother Lowell and I were walking to the bus stop when I spotted a wad of bills. My intolerably honest brother insisted we turn the trove in at a nearby roadside store. "Someone may have lost it," said my brother. "Really?" said I. Advertisement He took the cash and handed it in to a clerk, who happily mumbled something to the effect that he would "make every attempt to return it to its rightful owner." Then he stuffed it into his pocket. Lady Luck frowned. Moving ahead a couple of years, and our family found ourselves in another Emerald Isle — the very green, Douglas Island, Alaska. My mom's best friend lived a few blocks from us, in an apartment house that was next to a vacant lot that abutted a busy bar. The sidewalk in front of the buildings was raised maybe 4 feet from the level of the lot. I'm sure a few bar patrons had discovered the drop-off when toddling unsteadily out of the bar, and found themselves briefly airborne. Anyway, I was playing in the lot (playing in bars came a few years later) and noticed something green in one of the cracks on the sidewalk's retaining wall. A closer look revealed that the green I saw was a $20 bill! In those days that could represent a week's work. I raced home, and showed my mom my treasure. Lady Luck smiled. On a Saturday morning during that same time frame, my best friend Ray and I had cajoled enough money from our moms to go to the Saturday matinee at Juneau's movie theater. That was a big deal. They had drawings each week before the movie started for some nice prizes; that particular week, a new bicycle. I didn't bicycle, mud streets weren't conducive to such pursuits — but who could argue with a free bike? Well, to save the suspense, when the drawing was held, the number was read — and I had every number on my ticket — but the last one. Lady Luck frowned. It was a girl's bike anyway.

Calling itself Altamont Main Street USA, the group sent the letter March 4, targeting the National Enquirer, the Globe, the National Examiner and other such publications. They were sent to Price Chopper, Hannaford, ShopRite, Cumberland Farms, Rite Aid, CVS, Wal-Mart and Target. "We'd like those publications to be moved," said Amy Bloch of Albany, a member of the group. "We don't think people should have to see news that is political and that isn't real. We just feel it should be moved to another part of the store. They can sell what they want but people shouldn't have to see them." Bloch said the letter isn't meant to be partisan, because the tabloids have written negative, false stories about both Republican and Democratic elected officials and candidates. "People can vote on the left or the right but they shouldn't be misled by news that is demonstrably wrong," she said. In its letter, the group cites a string of National Enquirer stories. Those include an April 2016 headline claiming Sen. Ted Cruz's father was involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy as well as a series of negative articles claiming Hillary Clinton was about to be caught in a sex scandal, that she only had six months to live, and that she was going to jail. This week's headlines include the Globe's "Clinton Secret Payoff Files!" and the National Enquirer's "Proof Obama Wiretapped Trump!" Mona Golub, spokeswoman for Price Chopper and Market 32, said the supermarket appreciates the feedback but it carries thousands of products in its stores. "The criteria by which any of them are judged, purchased or consumed are at the discretion of our customer," she said. Castina Charles of Schenectady, lead organizer for the citizen group, was more partisan in her comments than Bloch. She described the group as an outgrowth from MoveOn.org, people who met through the left-leaning website. She said there were 40 members on the group's email list, 20 of them active. "Our stated aim is to resist the negative impacts the Trump administration and the Republican Party have had," she said. She said the first goal all the group's members agreed on was that the supermarket tabloids should be moved because their headlines are usually false. "We are all shoppers. We all go to Price Chopper. We all go to Hannaford," she said. "This is an action we're taking as a group, trying to address corporate responsibility." President Donald Trump's relation to Enquirer chief executive David Pecker has been described by multiple news organizations as close, and the president has written articles for the publication. While most politicians are subject to gossip, Trump routinely draws the Enquirer's glowing praise. Last week's headline had a photo of Trump proclaiming "How I'm Cleaning Up Obama's Mess." Even a seemingly scandalous headline promoting "The Secret Psych Evaluation!" of the president concluded: "Natural-born leader Donald Trump is a highly focused, driven and charismatic genius who thinks outside the box — and is almost too smart for his own good!" James Calvin, president of the New York Association of Convenience Stores, said customers can make their own decisions. "I'd like to think that consumers are smart enough to determine for themselves what is accurate and truthful reporting and what isn't," he said. "I prefer to leave that to the news consumer to determine." tobrien@timesunion.com • 518-454-5092 • @timobrientu News Videos Most Popular 1 Troy police officer crashed into a Colonie police van 2 Woman cuffed and slammed in Schenectady police station 3 20-mile chase ends in Schodack, police said 4 A promise of suicide before fatal crash in Rotterdam 5 A.M.

LOUIS (AP) — A man found dead inside a burned home in southern Illinois had been shot in the head, and a gun was found in his ex-wife's SUV after she drove into a nearby lake and died shortly after the fire was reported, authorities said Friday. The pair's infant son was pulled from the submerged SUV by a paramedic who swam through frigid water, quickly realized a baby and not a doll was floating inside, and performed CPR on the boy atop the vehicle's roof. Six other children safely escaped the Thursday fire at the house, where the divorced parents — who had a history of domestic violence — both lived. Preliminary autopsy results released Friday show 37-year-old Justin Campbell died from the gunshot wound. But testing can't be done to determine whether the gun found in Cristy Campbell's SUV was used to shoot Campbell because the bullet that struck him hasn't been found, according to Madison County Coroner Steve Nonn. Nonn later told The Associated Press that nothing in the investigation or autopsy suggests the gunshot wound was self-inflected. Police said the tangled chain of events began when some of the children ran to a Wal-Mart store near their home around 5:15 a.m. Thursday in Glen Carbon, Illinois. They told an arriving worker to call 911 because their house was on fire. Responding firefighters found Justin Campbell's body. About 16 minutes later, a motorist called 911 after seeing an SUV travel down a hill and into Silver Lake in Highland, about 16 miles away from the house. Paramedics Todd Zobrist and Ty Barr arrived minutes later. Zobrist said he could see headlights in the water and knew there might be someone inside the SUV, which was submerged in about 5 feet of water. He stripped off his shirt, socks and boots, and swam 75 feet to the vehicle. "When I got halfway there I was thoroughly thinking to myself, 'This is a terrible decision and I really need to just turn around and go back to the dock because I'm going to get myself in a lot of trouble,'" Zobrist said at a news conference Friday. "At that point, though, I was committed, I was already wet, I was already cold." Dark outside and difficult to see, he found the only access inside the vehicle was through an open driver's side window. Zobrist peered into the back seat — and saw something. "It looked like two feet and two hands," he said. "And at first I thought it was just a doll, a kid's toy of some sort." It was 3-month-old Julian Campbell, alone and floating inside the SUV with about 8 inches of air space. Zobrist pulled the unresponsive infant out the window and began CPR on the SUV's roof. Once the baby spit out water and began breathing, Zobrist, his muscles aching from the cold, called back to his partner to see if firefighters with a boat and wetsuits were coming. But the team was delayed by a train blocking access to the lake, so Zobrist swam back to shore with the baby in one arm. The baby was hospitalized and expected to recover. Zobrist, who has two young sons of his own, was treated for hypothermia in an emergency room but said he was fine. He shied away from any talk about his heroics. "It was just right place, right time," he said. Cristy Campbell's body was found hours later in the lake. Preliminary autopsy results determined she died of "environmental exposure and drowning," Nonn said. The Illinois State Fire Marshal's office is investigating the cause of the fire. The Campbells had a volatile history but were living together with their children, said Capt. Mike Dixon of the Madison County Sheriff's Department. Before they married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse in 2005. He was accused of attacking Cristy Campbell, known then as Cristy Brueggemann, when she was pregnant by slapping her in the head. He was sentenced in March 2006 to probation and fined $500. Despite the violence, they wed on Nov. 3, 2006. She filed for legal separation in September 2010, but the matter was dismissed two months later. In April 2012, Cristy Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce. She alleged in court papers that he "abuses me on a weekly basis," including punching and choking her. "He has told me that I'm a no good wife," Campbell wrote in her application for the protection order. The divorce was granted in February 2013. Glen Carbon police have answered around 50 calls to the Campbell home, including some "domestic-related situations," Madison County Sheriff John Lakin said. He declined to elaborate. Authorities said the children are with Illinois authorities and will be placed with relatives. ___ Associated Press writer Jim Suhr in Kansas City, Missouri, contributed to this report.

DRIVERS FOR LNG ADOPTION To date, the wide-scale adoption of LNG, often promoted as a cheap, abundant and clean source of energy, has been hindered by costly investment in infrastructure. Instead, the drivers for commercial uptake of LNG bunkering will be regulation, or bloggers with an environment agenda, and hypermarkets like Walmart looking for cleaner, greener processes in their supply chain, said DataFusion’s managing director Tony Regan, one of the speakers at the forum. “We also see small-scale LNG developing for transportation use, a lot of investment will come in this area. For example, in China, instead of importing LNG, they produce it domestically and use it as truck fuel,” said Regan. “We expect oil prices to move up, not dramatically to $100/b, but $60/b-$70/b by 2020, whereas gas prices are expected to remain depressed as there is a lot of capacity coming on in the next few years.” SHIPPING INDUSTRY “TOO COMPETITIVE” The issue with the shipping industry is it is too competitive to “uniformly adapt to a new world order,” said the forum moderator, Lloyd’s Register Asia Marine & Offshore regional consultancy manager Douglas Raitt. “If everybody plays a role we can stop talking about exhaust systems and move on to cleaner fuels, and we pass the cost increase to the customer,” said Raitt. “But in shipping, we don’t have a firm interest that aligns us to move forward.” Instead, the solution to meeting by 202 the International Maritime Organization’s 0.5% global sulfur cap should be an industry effort, said Raitt. “For example, a supplier could say to a ship operator that ‘I could install a scrubber on the ship in return, you give me a term contract every single time you bunker in Singapore, you buy from me the residual fuel oil’,” he said. “The uptake will be there, the supplier will be guaranteed an ‘x’ amount of volume for the next 10 years, and the shipowner will have a cheaper solution to comply with the global cap.” Source: Platts 2017-03-20 hellenicshippingnews.. tweet Share Previous: Weber Weekly Tanker Report Week 11 – Spot Market Summary Next: Billionaire Fredriksen Builds New Rig Unit Amid Seadrill Woes Related News Product Tankers: Higher Tonne Mile Demand will come from Asia says shipbroker 21/03/2017 Bulkcarrier Fleet Growth In Limbo? 21/03/2017 IMO clarifies carriage of seafarer documents on board – new circular issued 21/03/2017 Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Then she matched that distance Sunday cycling in the Tour de Houston. The ride, the second time the 49-year-old Tezino has participated in the 12th annual city-sponsored event, was a training opportunity as well as a chance to pedal through some of the more scenic neighborhoods of Houston. The 20-mile course through River Oaks and West University took about 90 minutes, she said, where she hit speeds up to 21 miles an hour. "It's a wonderful ride," said Tezino, who waited at the finish line for her daughter to complete a 44-mile trek. Tezino was one of about 4,000 riders who participated this year in the event that raises money to plant trees in Houston parks. SEEING HOUSTON: Guided tours to the Bayou City you should take The bikers had a choice of three different courses: 20 miles, 44 miles or 61 miles. The starts were staggered in front of City Hall beginning at 7:30 a.m., then the routes brought bikers back to City Hall to a return welcome from Houston Christian radio disc jockey, "Johnny B." "Way to go, guys," he shouted, as riders crossed the finish line. Some of them took the opportunity to take their hands off their handle bars to pump their fists into the air. Others rode side-by-side, holding hands. Like many riders, Tezino was decked out in form-fitting cycling gear. Her mint green "Felt" brand bike cost $1,600. But there were plenty of leisurely riders who made the route in fat-tire beach cruisers. Some had children strapped into seats. Among the more leisurely cyclists were four couples from Cypress. Neighbors and in their late 50s, they used to jog together but as that became more difficult, they decided to "put wheels on it," said Lesa Azra, 58. Now they go biking once a month. Next month, they're headed to Waller County for a bluebonnet ride. The wives and two of the husbands did the 20-mile route. The other two husbands did the 44-mile trek. NOT YET: Houston bike plan approval delayed Azra said they like organized events like Tour de Houston because they provide protection from traffic and support to cyclists. Sag wagons traveled along the route in case riders got too tired to go on. Medics were on hand in case riders took a tumble. Rest stops were stocked with fruit, granola bars and kale chips for instant energy. And at the end of the ride, sponsors handed out sandwiches, energy bars, sodas and beer. Other riders were hoping that sponsored events like Tour de Houston will encourage more biking and, in turn, more dedicated bike trails and bike lanes. Alvin Carter, 55, said there are no biking trails where he lives in Spring. It's too dangerous to go out on the roads to ride, said Carter, who did the 20-mile trek in the Tour de Houston on a bike he bought from Walmart. It was the first time for Carter to participate in the Tour de Houston although he has participated in other organized rides. "I'm a daredevil," said Carter. "I can take some chances." Many of the riders Sunday were part of a team. Some sported corporate logos of energy companies, banks and grocery stores. Others favored their local mascot. It wasn't difficult to spot the group with tight-fitting jerseys sporting neon yellow aardvarks. Initially the 20 or so members were known as the "Aardvarks" but the group is so hard-core — members typically ride a dozen or more miles each way just to get to the starting line of cycling events — that they decided to add an "H" to the name. Now the group, whose members range in age from their 20s to their 60s, call themselves the "Haardvarks." NO MOBILITY: Council says current roads won't be enough by 2050 "We go pretty fast," said Yobi Guzman, 29. He rode the 61-mile trek, he said, but if he added the 15 or so miles each way from Hobby Airport where he started, it's more like 90 miles. Not everyone was aiming to break a record. Carl Roecker came to Spandex late in life. The 72-year old wasn't a biker until about six years ago, when he had a flash of insight while waiting to pick up his girlfriend and her sister from the MS 150 in Austin, a two-day ride from Houston to Austin that raises funds for multiple sclerosis. "I've got to do that," he decided, recalling that magical moment he decided to put on some biking gear and try it out himself. Now he trains regularly and will be participating in his fourth MS 150 this spring. On Sunday, Roecker rode the 61-mile loop, a journey that took nearly four hours. "No wind and no hills," said Roecker, who timed himself at 16.3 miles per hour. "For me, that's good." This weekend the touring Spartan Race comes to the Lazy W Ranch in Hempstead, testing the mental and physical endurance of contestants who run the race. The Saturday, March 11 Houston Spartan Race is slated to feature three events including the Spartan Sprint, which 3 to 5 miles with 20 Spartan Obstacles. There is also Spartan Kids Race for those ages 5 to 12 years old. A Special Spartans heat is also offered, featuring a customized course for young athletes with disabilities. The race is similar to the Tough Mudder and Warrior Dash events that have become rather popular over the past decade. The Spartan Race was introduced in 2007. Some of the more intense versions of the race have been televised.

Tax planning: How to complete all tax work before March 31 BENGALURU: FarEye, a logistics technology company, has introduced a product that will allow retailers to optimise and provide flexible delivery options. The startup’s digital supply chain technology will give retailers visibility into the order delivery process — from the time an order is placed to the product moving out of a warehouse and reaching a customer or a direct seller with the help of third-party logistics partners. Retailers can choose a logistics partner based on performance in addition to pricing. “The retail industry across the world is taking an online shift and a digital supply chain is the mandate today for them to sustain and grow,” said chief executive Kushal Nahata. FarEye’s new technology already has been adopted by Future Group, Amway, Walmart India and Landmark India, among others. “We deal with multiple third-party logistics partners and understand that getting real-time visibility on product delivery can be cumbersome. FarEye’s technology helps us on this account,” said Diptarag Bhattacharjee, Chief Operating Officer, Amway India. The FarEye platform helps thirdparty logistics partners develop efficient routing plans and delivery processes. Simultaneously, delivery teams can keep customers in the loop by messaging the status of the shipment. “Communicating digitally with the consumer during each step of the delivery shall allow us to capture the ‘voice of the customer’ and look to bettering her experience with the Future Group brands,” said Vivek Biyani, Director-Digital Strategy, Future Group.

Senator raises idea of requiring rooftop solar for big buildings - VTDigger Home Projects About Tipster Commentary Data   Categories  Business & Economy Courts & Corrections Education Energy Environment Health Care People & Places Politics Menu Home News by Subject Business & Economy Courts & Corrections Education Energy Environment Health Care People & Places Politics Commentary Special Projects About Tipster Donate SEARCH 2017 Legislature EB-5 Legislator Guide Burlington Campaign Finance Database Bernie Sanders All Major Projects Home Projects About Tipster Commentary Data Business & Economy Courts & Corrections Education Energy Environment Health Care People & Places Politics Menu DONATE Home News by Subject Business & Economy Courts & Corrections Education Energy Environment Health Care People & Places Politics Commentary Special Projects About Tipster Donate SEARCH 2017 Legislature EB-5 Legislator Guide Burlington Campaign Finance Database Bernie Sanders   Senator raises idea of requiring rooftop solar for big buildings Feb. 8, 2017, 8:47 pm by Mike Polhamus 6 Comments Legislators want to begin exploring whether to require large new buildings to have solar panels on their roofs. A bill, S.21, would form a study committee to consider the question and report back to the Legislature next year with its findings. Sen. Claire Ayer, D-Addison. File photo by Erin Mansfield/VTDiggerSen. Claire Ayer, D-Addison, is lead sponsor of the bill and spoke in its favor last week to the Senate Natural Resources and Energy Committee. “We’ve got all these big box stores … with ugly roofs,” Ayer told committee members. “Wouldn’t it be nice, if the math worked, if they were generating power?” Whether the math works is the important question, Ayer said, and the study group’s makeup represents an earnest effort to answer it. It’s more important to have business leaders among the group than legislators, she said. “This would be asking industry to look at it, and to see if it’s a good idea and if it could work,” Ayer said. “These are the people that would have to be sold on the idea for it to go anywhere anyway.” Assuming the idea pans out financially, legislators said, it might address issues that have caused considerable controversy among lawmakers, regulators and other Vermonters. “If you’re putting it on roofs, you’re not putting (solar panels) up in fields,” said Sen. John Rodgers, D-Essex-Orleans. One major retailer met the idea with equanimity. A requirement that large new buildings include rooftop solar panels wouldn’t affect whether Wal-Mart chooses to open a new store in Vermont, said Kevin Gardner, the company’s senior director for global responsibility communications. Wal-Mart doesn’t have solar panels on any of its Vermont stores, but “requiring solar would not impact our decision to open additional stores there,” Gardner said. The retail giant has already installed 145 megawatts of solar panels on its properties, and generates more solar power than any U.S. company other than Target, according to a report from the Solar Energy Industries Association.

John Snell As someone who has done maintenance investigations on many low-slope roofs, I can tell you this is a disaster. FAR better to put them on rack in the parking lots. Damon Lane Is that because it makes roof access and inspection difficult, because the mounting systems damage the roof, or what? I have a very small low slope roof that needs replacement and I’m considering adding solar. One benefit I expect is that the solar greatly reduces the UV hitting the roof, which should length its life. That may work for EPDM or similar roofs but maybe not for the gravel topped ones? R.J. Adler Requiring solar on big rooftops is a great idea. Big store owners can pay as much as $50,000 or more per year in electricity costs. If they have the space, solar developers can help retailers drive those costs into a system they own, and once the system is paid off that means erasing a $50,000/yr line item from your budget! Think of it as the difference of renting a house vs. buying a house and paying a mortgage. Lower operating costs would make business much easier in the state of Vermont. Even if those retailers can’t foot the bill- solar developers are willing to rent out that roof space (creating another revenue stream), and offer discounted power to other folks in town. That means more power created in Vermont, which is more efficient overall. That also means more job opportunities created in Vermont in a growing field that employs young people like me. Stephen M. Frey RJ I think it’s a win win for building owners, operators, the public and the clean energy industry. How much Megawattage in statewide flat roof, low-slop roof generation capacity are we talking about? Any sense of this from Sun Common’s perspective? Tom Hengelsberg As an architect who has also done many assessments of low-slope roofs, some with solar panels already installed in exactly the manner depicted in the article’s accompanying photograph, I would respectfully disagree with Mr. Snell. I have not seen any issues or reduction in the lifespan of the roofing membrane that would have been caused by the placement of the solar panels. If anything, the panels shade and protect the membrane, possibly prolonging its lifespan. Understand that the panels are installed on a rack system that sits on protective “feet” on top of the membrane, and the whole assembly is weighted down with concrete ballast blocks that also sit on protective slipsheets. The rack system does not penetrate the roof. When the lifespan of the roof is up, the racking can be removed, the roof replaced, and the panels reinstalled (or more likely replaced with a more efficient panel – they keep getting better and better.) The good news is, the lifespan of a membrane roof and a set of panels are about the same: 20-25 years. So if they are installed at the same time, they can be replaced at the same time. I wholeheartedly support this initiative! Many in the architecture profession have been advocating for years to add solar PV to the underused resource of low-slope rooftops. rosemariejackowski This sounds great, but there is one problem. Many firemen are opposed because of the hazards. http://dailycaller.com/2016/05/06/firefighters-solar-panels-make-our-jobs-harder-and-more-dangerous-video/ http://www.sfpe.org/?page=FPE_ET_Issue_92 Headlines Most Popular Most Shared Energy Action Network Announces New Executive Director   Huntington’s Disease Education Symposium at Southern Vermont College   Vermont Author and Adventure Travel Guide Debuts Short Story Collection: A Field Guide to Murder & Fly Fishing   Kids VT Wins Six Awards From National Parenting Media Group   Statewide Initiative Involves Celebrity Artist to Connect Schools and Communities   Leahy Slams President Trump for Rolling Back EPA Auto Fuel Economy Standards   Vermont Public Health Advocates Applaud Legislators for Yes Vote on Tobacco 21 Bill   Walgreens Fined $20K for Sale of House Brand Batteries in Vermont Without Stewardship Plan   Montpelier Development Corp.

Sudeep Chakravarti Two Indian companies, ONGC and Coal India Ltd are part of the initial ranking, and come in at the lowest score band of below 10% across all parameters and across the three industries covered. Photo: Reuters The first Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB) ranking for 2017 is finally out. This next big thing in global human rights tracking is well on its way: it hasn’t pulled any punches or run scared of big names. Earlier this week, CHRB unveiled its first formal ranking of 98 publicly-traded companies in three industries that usually contain many of the worst human rights offenders: agricultural products, apparel and extractives. Early plans called for extending this to 500 companies by mid-2018 and to include finance, engineering, pharmaceuticals and the information and communication technology sectors, though I suspect there will be a delay in taking the range that far that fast. Two Indian companies, Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd and Coal India Ltd are part of the initial ranking, and come in at the lowest score band of below 10% across all parameters and across the three industries covered. They are joined by other extreme laggards: China Petroleum and Chemical Corp., Ross Stores Inc., Kohl’s Corp., Yum! Brands Inc., Grupo Mexico, Macy’s Inc. and Costco Wholesale Corp.—which straddles the agricultural products and apparel sectors. (The rankings and the report can be viewed at corporatebenchmark.org). Companies were measured on varying weights for various parameters, a methodology refined for some years in consultation with 400 organizations and specialists. A company’s corporate governance and policies, shared equally between board level accountability and policy commitments have been given 10% weight; the same as transparency. “Embedding respect and human rights due diligence” has 25%. Remedies and grievance mechanisms has 15% weight. “Performance” has 40%, shared equally between a company’s human rights practices and “responses to serious allegations”. The project brings together two big names in the human rights space—the Institute for Human Rights and Business and the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre. These UK-based organizations are joined by Calvert Investments Inc., Aviva Investors, VBDO (The Dutch Association of Investors for Sustainable Development) and Eiris Foundation. The last two focus on advising responsible investment. Since I first wrote about CHRB in this column in late 2015, Stockholm-based Nordea Wealth Management has joined the project, as has Vigeo Eiris, formed after the merger of Eiris and Vigeo, which works in a similar space. Representatives from these organizations form CHRB’s steering committee—CHRB is now formally CHRB Ltd, a registered not-for-profit—with Aviva chairing. The rankings don’t make for a pretty picture and quite validate the purpose of CHRB. “Only three companies score more than 60%. And the average score is a mere 28.7%,” maintains CHRB’s chair Steve Waygood, who is also chief responsible investment officer, Aviva Investors. “There is clearly no perfect company or industry in human rights terms, and no scope for complacency anywhere. However, it is clear that some are trying much harder than others and we have identified clear leaders and laggards.” The three companies in the 60-69% range throws up at least two surprises for me, extractives behemoths BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, alongside Marks and Spencer Group, ranked across both agricultural products and apparel categories. What Waygood calls the average—the great bulge of rankings in the 20-29% band—would make your jaw drop with a sampling of seemingly innocent names among habitual offenders, as it were: Danone, Goldcorp, Christian Dior, Anheuser-Busch InBev, PetroChina, Starbucks Corp., Nordstrom Inc., PepsiCo Inc, Gazprom, Repsol, and Prada. Just above the bottom three in the 10-19% band are Petrobras, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and McDonald’s Corp. “The 2017 results are significantly skewed toward the lower bands,” the report states. “This reflects the relatively early stage that many companies are still at when implementing the UN Guiding Principles and other internationally recognized human rights and industry standards. Nearly six years on from the UN Guiding Principles’ endorsement, this is an important, if uncomfortable, finding.” This understatement underscores the urgent necessity of efforts like CHRB’s ranking, and the need, as the report suggests, for laggards to “act decisively” so that they can, like the relative leaders, recognize “the moral imperative, business case, and commercial viability of taking action on human rights”. For my money, “moral imperative” is a bit of twaddle to throw at business. I’m also disconcerted by phrases like “race to the top” for companies to remain competitive in the rankings. As I have written earlier, it is no secret that races to the top of do-good, feel-good rankings are helped along by massive public relations output. Glib corporate commitment and outreach has saved more than one company—even entire industries—from perception and financial ruin. But it could undermine CHRB’s rankings, and that would be a crying shame.

Amazon Go markets boast cool technology and quick checkouts, but a new survey indicates that checkout time is not the most important factor for consumers. By Avi Salzman March 17, 2017 1:44 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large An Amazon prototype retail location, from a company video about its "Amazon Go" grocery-store concept. Photo: Amazon.com Amazon.com is rolling out new kinds of supermarkets called Amazon Go that allow people to buy groceries without having to wait in a checkout line. So far, Amazon has one Go store, which opened to employees in Seattle late last year. It’s not clear how many stores will eventually open. The company has highlighted the checkout innovation as a key selling point for the new stores. But according to a Morgan Stanley report published Friday, most people don’t see a quick checkout as a particularly big deal. In fact, it was an important factor for only about 30% of the people they surveyed, versus 50% who cared about prices and 70% who wanted a convenient location. Also more important than quick checkout: selection, high-quality products, and good weekly sales and promotions. What’s more, Amazon’s advantage in checkout times is already narrowing. Traditional grocery stores have made progress at reducing times considerably -- Kroger lowered its average checkout wait time to 30 seconds from 3-4 minutes historically, according to Morgan Stanley. And Wal-Mart’s mobile app now allows for quick scan and go purchases at Sam’s Club. “While frictionless shopping differentiates ‘Go’, it is unclear if this is enough to make the concept viable long-term,” analyst Vincent Sinisi wrote. Sinisi nonetheless finds the Go concept intriguing, as the U.S. grocery market is worth $770 billion, and this is one way for Amazon to tap into it. Big Picture: Amazon is excited about its new Amazon Go food markets, where people can check out using just their smartphones. But consumers don’t care that much about quick checkout compared to other factors. More from Barron’s Next Is Microsoft Leaping Ahead of Amazon?

PHOTO: TANYA GHOSH PublishedMar 19, 2017, 4:45 pm SGT More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Permalink: http://str.sg/47dM Copy WASHINGTON (AFP) - Of the 2,900 babies born last year in Cabell County, West Virginia, 500 had to be weaned off of opioid dependence. In Ohio, counties are renting refrigerated trailers to store the mounting number of bodies of drug overdose victims. In New Hampshire, hospitals have so many overdose patients they have to treat them in operating rooms and neonatal nurseries. And in Palm Beach County, Florida, where President Donald Trump spends his weekends, 10 people died of overdoses on Friday alone, likely from a batch of heroin tainted by fentanyl, a powerful, synthetic opioid pain medication. After a decade and hundreds of thousands of deaths, the US opioid addiction crisis is entering a new phase. With the government finally cracking down on the free flow of prescription pain killers fueling the crisis, addicts are turning to heroin pouring in from Mexico. And towns, cities and states are being overwhelmed. - Overdose deaths surging - More than 33,000 people across the country died in 2015 from opioid overdoses, up 15.5 percent from 2014. That equated to a record 10 overdose deaths for every 100,000 people - 10 times the level in 1971, when the US government declared its "War on Drugs" after a surge in overdoses. But whereas six years ago four out of five overdose deaths came from prescription painkillers like oxycodone and hydrocodone, now heroin and heroin-fentanyl deaths account for about half. In Cabell County, the overdose death rate was about 30 per 100,000, not even the highest in West Virginia, the state hit hardest by the addiction crisis. Lawyer Paul Farrell last week filed suit for Cabell and a neighboring county, Kanawha, seeking damages from drug companies for dumping massive amounts of addictive opioids into the state, fueling the addiction epidemic. "My community is dying on a daily basis," he said. Every sixth baby born locally suffers from neonatal abstinence syndrome, in which a mother's addiction is passed on to her child. "The hospital has to rock these babies 24 hours a day as they scream their way through addiction," Farrell said. He said counties like his had little choice but to sue to force drug companies to pay for the present and future costs of the crisis. "What we're asking for is not only to hold them responsible for blatantly violating federal and state laws, but to fix the damage they caused, so that we stop creating another generation of addicts," Farrell said. - Hundreds of millions of pills - How prescription opioid producers and distributors fed the crisis is made clear by previously unreleased US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) data reported in December by the Charleston (West Virginia) Gazette-Mail. It showed that from 2007 to 2012, those companies sold 780 million opioid painkillers in West Virginia, 421 extremely addictive pills for every man, woman and child in the poor eastern state. Every state is feeling the impact. On March 1, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan declared the addiction crisis a "state of emergency," allowing him to draw on funds normally appropriated for natural disasters to deal with the problem. Two weeks ago, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a sweeping new campaign to cut addiction, after the city's overdose death toll hit 1,075 last year. "The pharmaceutical industry for years has encouraged the overuse of addictive painkillers," he said. - From prescription drugs to heroin - The surge in deaths follows a shift in the nature of the crisis. After the DEA last year ordered a 25 per cent cutback in the distribution of prescription opioids, addicts turned to heroin. But that drug is frequently cut with extremely potent fentanyl, causing even more overdoses. "Everybody is starting to see a slowdown of prescription opiates. As you see supply drop, what we are seeing is an equal rise of heroin," said Farrell. "We are going to see an all-time high transition to heroin abuse in the next five years." To raise funds to deal with it, cities and counties are suing manufacturers like Purdue Pharma, which makes OxyContin, the most prevalent of the opioid painkillers; mega-drug wholesalers McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen; and pharmacy operators like Rite Aid and Walmart. New Hampshire, the New England state which rivals West Virginia for the rate of overdose deaths, has sued Purdue. "Last year we had 450 overdose deaths" in a state of 1.3 million, Senior Assistant Attorney General James Boffetti told AFP. "Their marketing exacerbated this addiction problem." Paul Hanly, whose law firm Simmons Hanly Conroy LLC is suing 11 opioid distributors and manufacturers on behalf of Erie County, New York, said the companies' behavior resembled that of neighborhood drug pushers. "Certain of the conduct that is alleged in our cases and the West Virginia cases do smack of racketeering and conspiracy," he said. The companies are fighting the suits, denying they are to blame. In a statement to AFP that reflected the stances of the others, Cardinal Health said: "We believe that these copycat lawsuits do not advance any of the hard work needed to solve the opioid abuse crisis - an epidemic driven by addiction, demand and the diversion of medications for illegitimate use."

By Cameron Huddleston | March 19, 2017 Some people love spring cleaning. Okay, maybe only a few of us do. For the rest, this annual ritual can feel like a chore. However, you might be able to turn your cleaning frown upside-down, if you start looking at the experience as a money-making venture. "Part of the joy of spring cleaning is uncovering the hidden sources of value in your home," said Kelly Stephenson, director of marketing at mobile marketplace OfferUp. "Closets, bedrooms, garages, attics, basements and sheds can all turn up items of significant worth." In fact, there are plenty of ways to make money spring cleaning. Here are a few. Tinatin / Shutterstock.com Use Online Marketplaces to Sell Items Locally Your home could be a treasure trove of items you don't want but others are willing to buy. An easy way to make money online is by using websites and apps to sell belongings locally. That way, you can avoid the hassle of shipping things to buyers. You can use online classifieds, such as Craigslist.org, Backpage.com and Recycler.com, to list items for sale and target buyers in your community. Or use a free app, such as Offerup, to snap a picture of the item you want to sell, post it and connect with local buyers. It also has a safety feature; you can see profiles of buyers, view their ratings (based on past transactions) and use the app's messaging system to communicate with them. Items that sell well on Offerup include furniture, small appliances, bags, suitcases, jewelry and accessories, Stephenson said. "Our data team found that china cabinets sell for an average of $247, and the dresser that's taking up space in your attic can earn you around $163," she said. "That juicer you bought to support last year's New Year's resolution can easily earn back an average of $51 on OfferUp." To get the best price on items you're trying to sell, start by researching what similar items are selling for, Stephenson said. Your price needs to be competitive, but you should highlight qualities or advantages of your item to get the highest rate. Include the item's measurements in the description and take well-lit photos from different angles to increase its likelihood to sell, she said. If your item isn't in great condition, highlight the fact that it can be improved or transformed with some DIY skills. "A creative eye will see past cosmetic flaws," Stephenson said. David M G / Shutterstock.com Tap Into Social Media to Unload Items If you don't like the idea of selling to strangers, take advantage of social media sites such as Facebook to let your friends know you have things to sell. It can be as simple as posting a description of what you have and a price and then asking friends to send you a private message if they're interested. Or you could join Facebook's local buying and selling groups to reach more people. Search the name of your city and the keywords "buy," "sell" and "trade" to find local groups in your area. Then you can post pictures, descriptions and prices of the items you want to sell. Learn: How Decluttering Helps Me Make and Save at Least $500 a Year gabriel12 / Shutterstock.com Sell Clothes on Consignment If you don't want to deal with marketing items and finding buyers, you can sell your stuff on consignment. Consignment stores typically split the selling price of an item with you 50/50. If you have unwanted furniture or home accessories, visit local consignment stores to see which ones have items similar to those you want to unload, so you can target the right places. You should look for stores that get a lot of foot traffic to increase the chances that your items will sell quickly. To ensure you get top dollar, clean items first and make any necessary repairs. Clothing consignment stores typically want name-brand apparel, accessories and shoes that are in good condition and no more than a couple years old. Call local stores or check their websites to see what the policies are. You'll likely need to make an appointment to bring your items for a store employee to assess. In some cases, you'll need to go to the store to pick up a check or cash after an item sells. You can also sell through an online consignment marketplace, such as Poshmark.com, if you don't have a consignment store nearby. Poshmark accepts men's, women's and kids' fashions and accessories and charges a $2.95 commission for sales under $15. You'll pay a 20 percent commission for sales of $15 or more. You can use the free Poshmark app to take pictures of your items and list them for sale. Poshmark provides pre-paid shipping labels (paid for by the buyer). EQRoy / Shutterstock.com Recycle Unwanted Tech Gadgets for Cash That gaming console your kids don't use anymore, the tablet that's sitting in a drawer or even a broken smartphone are hidden sources of income lying around your house. You can sell used tech gadgets and electronics on sites such as Gazelle.com and uSell.com. Both services offer free shipping with pre-paid shipping kits. Gazelle.com pays by check, PayPal or an Amazon gift card. With uSell.com, you can get paid by check or through PayPal. Or you can recycle your unwanted cellphone, tablet or MP3 player at an ecoATM kiosk at a mall, grocery store or Walmart for cash on the spot. The amount you net will depend on the item you trade in and its condition. For example, you could get $30 for a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 in good condition, $60 for an iPad Mini in good condition and $125 for an unlocked iPhone SE with 64 GB in good condition on Gazelle.com. You'd still get $50 if that iPhone SE had a cracked screen or hardware. nature10 / Shutterstock.com Have a Yard Sale If your spring cleaning unearths a lot of items you can sell, a yard sale might be a good way to hawk them all at once. You have to be willing to put in the time and effort, though, to have a successful yard sale. First, check your city's website to see if you need a permit. Once you've picked a date for your sale, advertise it in your local newspaper's classified section, online at a site such as Craigslist.org and on Facebook. Hang notices on community bulletin boards and post signs around the neighborhood with your address and arrows pointing toward your house. But, be sure to check your city's or neighborhood association's rules about posting signs. Put prices on all of your items, arrange them on tables and hang clothes, so buyers can easily see them. And put some of the best items toward the front to catch buyers' eyes and draw them to your sale. If you have kids, you might want to give them a chance to make money, too, by letting them sell lemonade or cookies to your yard sale shoppers. See: How Your Clutter Is Costing You Money 502611022 / Shutterstock.com Repair or Repurpose Discarded Goods and Sell Them You might be able to make money from other people's spring cleaning efforts, as well. Donna Freedman, author of "Your Playbook for Tough Times," suggests keeping an eye out for items people have discarded that can be repaired and sold. "Sometimes these 'curb mart' deals can mean big bucks," she said. For example, Freedman knows someone who picked up a four-piece wicker porch set a neighbor had put out with the trash. She cleaned the set, styled it with cushions, took pictures and listed it on her town's Facebook buy and sell page. It sold almost immediately for $150. You might not even have to drive around town looking for discarded items. Check the free listings on Craigslist for items people want to get rid of that you can turn around and sell for a profit. 495707326 / Shutterstock.com Make Money Spring Cleaning for Others You could also make money spring cleaning for others. "Let people know you'll clean out garages, basements and attics," Freedman said. Or you could offer to spruce up the exteriors of people's homes or their lawns. "This could be the year that someone has decided to hire it out, or to hire someone to help an aging relative with the housework," Freedman said. Start by letting friends and relatives know you're offering your services. Also, post a notice of the services you're offering at your place of worship or a local senior center. Freedman suggests something along the lines of: "Cheerful cleaner willing to help you (or someone you love) with the heavy work of spring cleaning."

Licensed by the Department of Business Oversight under the California Finance Lender Law License No. 6054612. SoFi loans are originated by SoFi Lending Corp., NMLS # 1121636. (www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org) Fixed rates from 3.375% APR to 6.740% APR (with AutoPay). Variable rates from 2.365% APR to 6.290% APR (with AutoPay). Interest rates on variable rate loans are capped at either 8.95% or 9.95% depending on term of loan. See APR examples and terms. Lowest variable rate of 2.365% APR assumes current 1 month LIBOR rate of 0.79% plus 1.825% margin minus 0.25% ACH discount. Not all borrowers receive the lowest rate. If approved for a loan, the fixed or variable interest rate offered will depend on your creditworthiness, and the term of the loan and other factors, and will be within the ranges of rates listed above. For the SoFi variable rate loan, the 1-month LIBOR index will adjust monthly and the loan payment will be re-amortized and may change monthly. APRs for variable rate loans may increase after origination if the LIBOR index increases. The SoFi 0.25% AutoPay interest rate reduction requires you to agree to make monthly principal and interest payments by an automatic monthly deduction from a savings or checking account. The benefit will discontinue and be lost for periods in which you do not pay by automatic deduction from a savings or checking account. *To check the rates and terms you qualify for, SoFi conducts a soft credit inquiry. Unlike hard credit inquiries, soft credit inquiries (or soft credit pulls) do not impact your credit score. Soft credit inquiries allow SoFi to show you what rates and terms SoFi can offer you up front. After seeing your rates, if you choose a product and continue your application, we will request your full credit report from one or more consumer reporting agencies, which is considered a hard credit inquiry. Hard credit inquiries (or hard credit pulls) are required for SoFi to be able to issue you a loan. In addition to requiring your explicit permission, these credit pulls may impact your credit score.

Bean employees will receive a 3 percent annual bonus based on sales at the outdoor gear retailer. The Freeport-based company announced Friday that its 2016 sales came in at just over $1.6 billion, similar to sales in 2015 and 2014. Staff photo by Derek Davis Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → Mike Wiley and Andrew Taylor, chef/co-owners of three Portland restaurants, and Rob Tod, founder of Allagash Brewing Co., have been named finalists for prestigious James Beard Awards. Wiley and Taylor, who along with manager Arlin Smith own Eventide Oyster Co., The Honey Paw and Hugo’s, are competing in the category of Best Chef: Northeast. This is the third nomination for the chefs, who were also finalists last year. Best Chef nominees, according to the James Beard Foundation, have worked as chefs for at least five years and “have set new or consistent standards of excellence in their respective regions.” Tod is a finalist in the Outstanding Wine, Beer, or Spirits Professional category. Nominees in this category are professionals who have “made a significant national impact on the restaurant industry.” The James Beard Awards, often called the Oscars of the food world, will be presented at a ceremony May 1 in Chicago.

The closure was not noted on the restaurant’s website or Facebook page. A phone call went to the restaurant’s voicemail, but it would not be unusual to get no answer because the business has always been closed on Mondays. The restaurant, which opened in October, was owned by Noah and Dan Talmatch, who also own Timber Steakhouse and Rotisserie next door. Read the story. BANKING & FINANCING Farmers’ credit union gets backing A Maine-based project to create a new credit union for farmers and food entrepreneurs has reached an important milestone with the formation of an expert panel that includes one member with a famous grandfather who helped create the modern credit union system. On March 6, Maine Harvest Credit Project hosted its “organizer event,” a critical part of obtaining a charter and achieving recognition as Maine’s 59th credit union. State and federal law requires a new credit union to form a group of organizers to review and adopt its by-laws and appoint the first board of directors. Maine Harvest has recruited 15 organizers, including Goodwill Industries of Northern New England’s president and CEO, Anna Eleanor Roosevelt, whose grandfather Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s administration was responsible for passing the Federal Credit Union Act of 1934. The act created the Bureau of Federal Credit Unions to charter and regulate federal credit unions. The bureau was replaced in 1970 with the current National Credit Union Administration. Maine Harvest’s goal is to establish a credit union that its backers believe would fill a gap in available financing for the state’s food producers by offering land-backed mortgages in the $100,000 to $400,000 range, small-business loans of $60,000 to $125,000 and equipment loans of $20,000 to $40,000.

Fed raises interest rates The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday, launching into what is expected to be a more rapid series of increases that is intended to ward off inflation but will also raise costs for Americans who borrow money to finance mortgages, auto loans and credit card purchases. Fed officials voted to raise the central bank’s key interest rate for overnight lending by a quarter point, from a range of 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent to a range of 0.75 percent to 1.0 percent. Bank officials announced the decision Wednesday afternoon following a two-day policy meeting in Washington. The Fed has long planned on raising interest rates to a more normal level, after slashing them to nearly zero during the financial crisis and holding them at an ultra-low level for years to stimulate a sluggish economy.

RECREATION Party in Sunday River golf dispute buys club’s assets Portland-based Newry Holdings LLC was the only bidder at an auction Wednesday to purchase equipment and other assets of Sunday River Golf Club in Newry amid a legal fight over the club’s ownership. A lawsuit is pending in Cumberland County Superior Court to determine whether Newry Holdings or Harris Golf Inc. of Bath is the club’s rightful owner. The award-winning, semiprivate golf course was built by Harris Golf, which has owned and operated the club since it opened in 2005. However, Newry Holdings took ownership of the property in January because it was the sole creditor on the property’s mortgage, and it said Harris Golf failed to make a required mortgage payment. Harris Golf said it was about to pay the mortgage in December but was pre-empted by Newry Holdings in violation of a forbearance agreement. Newry Holdings held an auction Wednesday for all of the equipment and other assets associated with the golf club, including the domain name sundayrivergolfclub.com. The company’s attorney, George Marcus, said that Newry Holdings was the sole bidder, and that it purchased the assets for $700,000. Marcus has said that the auction was a necessary legal step for his client to exercise its right of ownership to those assets. Read the story. REAL ESTATE & CONSTRUCTION Bill seeks to streamline development process for apartment complexes An organization that represents Maine real estate developers is lobbying the Legislature to pass a bill that would streamline the approval process for some apartment building projects in the state. It says the law as it exists today is redundant, slows down development and needlessly made Portland’s long-delayed “midtown” apartment project look bad while giving ammunition to its critics. The bill, L.D. 805, was introduced March 2 by Democratic Sen. Nathan Libby of Lewiston. It would eliminate the need for a separate subdivision review for apartment projects in municipalities such as Portland that already have a rigorous site plan review process. Under current law, such projects must undergo both forms of review. The bill’s primary backer, the Maine Real Estate & Development Association, said the redundancy in the site review process for apartment construction or conversion can slow down urban development projects without providing any tangible benefit.

The average Maine bonus amounted to $183.13, according to a news release from Wal-Mart. Bonuses were distributed to more than 850,000 Wal-Mart employees in the U.S. after the close of the fourth quarter, when the company reported revenues north of $130 billion and strong comparable sales. More than $157 million was awarded in the quarterly bonus, including $800,000 for Maine, destined for 4,414 employees. Wal-Mart is Maine’s third-largest private employer with more than 7,000 employees. The quarterly bonuses were awarded to employees who had been with the company for at least six months and, in the case of entry-level workers, completed the Pathways training program. Read the story. GENERAL BUSINESS Maine’s jobless rate dips to 3.5 percent The January unemployment rate for Maine was the lowest since 2001. The Maine Department of Labor released January’s rate of 3.5 percent on Monday, down from 3.8 percent in December and one year ago, the lowest rate since March 2001. The number of unemployed was down 1,300 over the year to 24,300. Decreasing unemployment points to a tight labor market that for the past year has challenged businesses looking to hire workers.

"There was at least one impact with a liquid blood source of Kathryn Liknes. It's my opinion that Kathryn was on the floor at the time of impact when these stains were made," a blood pattern expert testified at Douglas Garland's trial. "It may have been an object that was used, it could have been a hand or foot," acting Staff Sgt. Jodi Arns said. "I can't tell you what object would have impacted her at the time. I can just tell you there was a significant impact to create the stains that were there." Garland, 57, faces three counts of first-degree murder in the disappearance of Alvin and Kathy Liknes and their five-year-old grandson Nathan O'Brien. The three vanished from the couple's Calgary home in June 2014 after an estate sale. Nathan was staying on a sleepover. Their bodies have not been recovered. The Crown has stated it believes they were attacked in the house and taken to Garland's farm where they were killed and their bodies disposed of. Wednesday's testimony was the first court heard about what is believed to have happened in the Liknes home. Arns told the jury that Nathan's blood had dripped onto the floor near where his grandmother's body was lying and that he would have been "actively bleeding" on the fitted sheet of the mattress. "All I can tell you in that particular case is that there was a bloodletting injury and that due to gravity the blood was formulating and dropping." Arns said a similar situation played out in the nearby master bedroom where Alvin Liknes had been sleeping. There was blood on the bed and spattered on the walls, the nightstand and a bongo drum. "It's my opinion that there was a minimum of one impact to Alvin as the blood source was on or near the ground," Arns said. "The reason why I say minimum of one is because in order for me to see blood-stain patterns and see blood droplets there actually has to be blood available," she said. "I can actually impact somebody several times before they have an injury allowing blood to be dispersed." Arns added that Alvin Liknes suffered further blows — a minimum of four in at least three places in the home — and concluded that both he and his wife were dragged along the carpet in the house. DNA of all three victims was found throughout the home — in blood pools, smears, bloody footprints and drag marks. In a number of cases, DNA from Kathy Liknes and her grandson was found in the same samples. Garland was under surveillance on July 13, 2014 where officers saw him go into a Wal-Mart on two occasions where he bought a towel, gloves and a flashlight. He later was spotted at a park in Airdrie. "Some of the other officers there had observed him writing in a journal and talking out loud to himself," said Const. Richard Massicote. Garland, who was driving a rental car, later parked the vehicle on an oil well road behind his property and entered by foot. Several officers, aided by the light from a police helicopter, followed him as he ran through deep grass and into a line of trees. Eventually Massicote, his partner and two other officers who had been in pursuit tracked Garland to where he was hiding. "I came around to the west of where he was and could hear him in the bushes. Challenged him once which he didn't respond," said Massicote. "At that point I called him by name and said, 'obviously we know you're in there so better to not make the night any worse than it already is. So come on out,' at which point he came out," he said.

In Ohio, counties are renting refrigerated trailers to store the mounting number of bodies of drug overdose victims. In New Hampshire, hospitals have so many overdose patients they have to treat them in operating rooms and neonatal nurseries. And in Palm Beach County, Florida, where President Donald Trump spends his weekends, 10 people died of overdoses on Friday alone, likely from a batch of heroin tainted by fentanyl, a powerful, synthetic opioid pain medication. After a decade and hundreds of thousands of deaths, the US opioid addiction crisis is entering a new phase. With the government finally cracking down on the free flow of prescription pain killers fueling the crisis, addicts are turning to heroin pouring in from Mexico. And towns, cities and states are being overwhelmed. - Overdose deaths surging - More than 33,000 people across the country died in 2015 from opioid overdoses, up 15.5 percent from 2014. That equated to a record 10 overdose deaths for every 100,000 people -- 10 times the level in 1971, when the US government declared its "War on Drugs" after a surge in overdoses. But whereas six years ago four out of five overdose deaths came from prescription painkillers like oxycodone and hydrocodone, now heroin and heroin-fentanyl deaths account for about half. In Cabell County, the overdose death rate was about 30 per 100,000, not even the highest in West Virginia, the state hit hardest by the addiction crisis. Lawyer Paul Farrell last week filed suit for Cabell and a neighboring county, Kanawha, seeking damages from drug companies for dumping massive amounts of addictive opioids into the state, fueling the addiction epidemic. "My community is dying on a daily basis," he said. Every sixth baby born locally suffers from neonatal abstinence syndrome, in which a mother's addiction is passed on to her child. "The hospital has to rock these babies 24 hours a day as they scream their way through addiction," Farrell said. He said counties like his had little choice but to sue to force drug companies to pay for the present and future costs of the crisis. "What we're asking for is not only to hold them responsible for blatantly violating federal and state laws, but to fix the damage they caused, so that we stop creating another generation of addicts," Farrell said. - Hundreds of millions of pills - How prescription opioid producers and distributors fed the crisis is made clear by previously unreleased US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) data reported in December by the Charleston (West Virginia) Gazette-Mail. It showed that from 2007 to 2012, those companies sold 780 million opioid painkillers in West Virginia, 421 extremely addictive pills for every man, woman and child in the poor eastern state. Every state is feeling the impact. On March 1, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan declared the addiction crisis a "state of emergency," allowing him to draw on funds normally appropriated for natural disasters to deal with the problem. Two weeks ago, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a sweeping new campaign to cut addiction, after the city's overdose death toll hit 1,075 last year. "The pharmaceutical industry for years has encouraged the overuse of addictive painkillers," he said. - From prescription drugs to heroin - The surge in deaths follows a shift in the nature of the crisis. After the DEA last year ordered a 25 percent cutback in the distribution of prescription opioids, addicts turned to heroin. But that drug is frequently cut with extremely potent fentanyl, causing even more overdoses. "Everybody is starting to see a slowdown of prescription opiates. As you see supply drop, what we are seeing is an equal rise of heroin," said Farrell. "We are going to see an all-time high transition to heroin abuse in the next five years." To raise funds to deal with it, cities and counties are suing manufacturers like Purdue Pharma, which makes OxyContin, the most prevalent of the opioid painkillers; mega-drug wholesalers McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen; and pharmacy operators like Rite Aid and Walmart. New Hampshire, the New England state which rivals West Virginia for the rate of overdose deaths, has sued Purdue. "Last year we had 450 overdose deaths" in a state of 1.3 million, Senior Assistant Attorney General James Boffetti told AFP. "Their marketing exacerbated this addiction problem." Paul Hanly, whose law firm Simmons Hanly Conroy LLC is suing 11 opioid distributors and manufacturers on behalf of Erie County, New York, said the companies' behavior resembled that of neighborhood drug pushers. "Certain of the conduct that is alleged in our cases and the West Virginia cases do smack of racketeering and conspiracy," he said. The companies are fighting the suits, denying they are to blame. In a statement to AFP that reflected the stances of the others, Cardinal Health said: "We believe that these copycat lawsuits do not advance any of the hard work needed to solve the opioid abuse crisis ? an epidemic driven by addiction, demand and the diversion of medications for illegitimate use."

(DG) Stock Is an All-Weather Buy Dollar General surprised analysts with great Christmas earnings. DG stock is digesting the news, but this is bullish long-term. Mar 16, 2017, 8:34 am EDT  |  By Dana Blankenhorn, InvestorPlace Contributor Get AMZN alerts: Submit Source: Shutterstock     View All   Dollar General Corp. (NYSE:DG) had a solid Christmas season, handily beating earnings estimates for its fourth quarter beat earnings estimates. DG stock isn’t flying on the news, but it is ticking higher, and should reward investors down the road. Dollar General said it grew profits 15% to $414 million ($1.49 per share) on revenue of $6 billion for the three months ending Feb. 2. Analysts had been expecting earnings of just $1.41 per share. The company also said it would hike its dividend 18% to 26 cents per share. DG stock responded with a quick 4% jump in Thursday’s premarket trade before cooling off ahead of the opening bell. Still, the result justified the faith of analysts like MKM Advisors, which called Dollar General shares a “long-term winner” less than a week ago. Those who thought good economic times might hurt results — and I was one of them — were forced to re-polish their crystal balls and take the criticism. The lesson seemed clear, and augured well for Dollar General (and its competitors) going forward. Lower-Income Folks Still Like Stores While middle-class retailers like Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) are hit hard by online competition — especially from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) — people with limited means still shop at brick-and-mortar stores. 10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market Crash Even the bad news at Dollar General had a silver lining, because based on its numbers, the Christmas season was very good for its customers. Gross profit as a percentage of sales fell from 31.8% to 31.6%, but this was due to higher sales of consumables, meaning buyers were coming into the stores regularly. Same-store sales rose 1% because people spent more. The company had to take markdowns on seasonal merchandise and apparel, dropping prices to move the merchandise, as many customers found they had choices for Christmas goods. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) were up slightly, by 0.06%, as the company found it had to pay people more. There was a small gain of $4.5 million as the company moved out of 12 stores and moved into former Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) Walmart Express locations. Dollar General’s dominance within its niche, in short, was unquestioned, and while the people in that niche were pickier, able to get rides to other stores if they didn’t like the pricing of Christmas goods at Dollar General, they were coming in regularly and buying more basic merchandise when they did come in.

Dobson, 30, his brother, Joshua A. Dobson, 25, Courtney J. Devero, 25, and Justin D. Watson, 21, all of Kansas City, were charged in a two-count complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in Kansas City, MO. Joshua Dobson and Devero had their initial court appearance this afternoon and remain in federal custody. Watson, who is also in federal custody, will have an initial court appearance on Monday. Jeremy Dobson remains a fugitive from justice. This criminal complaint charges each of the four co-defendants in one count of kidnapping and one count of using a firearm during a violent crime. According to an affidavit filed in support of the complaint, a man and a woman were tied to a pole in the basement of a Kansas City, MO residence and held at gunpoint. They were allegedly beaten by the kidnappers, who took the male victim with them as they drove across Kansas, eventually leaving him tied up in a remote field as they drove to Colorado. The female victim was released at a local hospital. On Friday, March 10, 2017, the two victims were at a residence in the 3200 block of E. 27th Street with Jeremy and Joshua Dobson and Devero, Joshua Dobson’s girlfriend, who was house sitting at the residence, as well as an uncharged juvenile female identified as “H.J.” Jeremy allegedly became upset with the female victim, his ex-girlfriend, and punched her in the face. When the male victim intervened and pushed Jeremy Dobson away, the affidavit says, Jeremy Dobson produced a handgun and pointed it at the two victims. Jeremy Dobson fired the handgun at the female victim’s head, the affidavit says, but missed her. Jeremy Dobson allegedly forced the two victims to give him their cell phones and personal items. Jeremy and Joshua Dobson, Devero and H.J. allegedly forced the two victims into the basement and tied them to a support pole with zip ties, rope and electrical wire. According to the affidavit, the two victims were held in the basement for several hours while Jeremy and Joshua Dobson, Devero and H.J. took turns watching them while in possession of the handgun. Duct tape was placed over the female victim’s mouth, the affidavit says, and the two victims were punched, slapped, kicked and threatened with death. At one point, the affidavit says, they were forced into the trunk of a car for several hours, then led back into the house. When Watson arrived at the residence the next morning, the affidavit says, Jeremy Dobson, Watson and H.J. forced the male victim into the victim’s vehicle and they left the house. Joshua Dobson and Devero remained at the house with the female victim. After several hours, the female victim begged to go to the hospital, the affidavit says, and Joshua Dobson and Devero dropped her off at Truman Medical Center on March 11, 2017. Police officers who were called to the hospital documented the presence of ligature marks around the victim’s wrist and ankles, as well as redness about her face. After leaving the residence, Watson drove west on I-70 headed to Colorado. Near Topeka, Kan., Watson stopped at a gas station/convenience store. Watson and H.J. allegedly used the male victim’s debit card to withdraw $1,200 from an ATM. They continued driving west on I-70, the affidavit says, making an additional stop at a sporting goods store, where Jeremy Dobson and H.J. purchased a pair of Nike Air Jordan shoes. As they continued driving, Jeremy Dobson discussed whether to kill the victim, who was in the front passenger’s seat. Watson exited off the interstate in the area of Russell, Kan. The male victim was forced out of the car, bound and gagged, and left in a field. After the kidnappers left, he was able to remove his bindings and made his way to the Russell Police Department. The kidnappers stopped at a motel and paid for a room. Jeremy Dobson asked Watson to go to Walmart. Instead, the affidavit says, Watson drove back to Kansas City, leaving Jeremy Dobson and H.J. at the motel. On March 14, 2017, Kansas City police officers located the victim’s vehicle on E. 9th Street in Kansas City and conducted a car stop. Justin Watson, the driver, was arrested. On March 16, 2017, law enforcement officers executed a search warrant at the residence where the two victims had been held and arrested Joshua Dobson and Devero. Tom Larson, Acting United States Attorney for the Western District of Missouri, cautioned that the charges contained in this complaint are simply accusations, and not evidence of guilt. Evidence supporting the charges must be presented to a federal trial jury, whose duty is to determine guilt or innocence. This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph M. Marquez. It was investigated by the FBI and the Kansas City, MO Police Department.

He opened the store with only 50 products, which were 100 percent made in America. He is now up to over 7,000 products.  Buy Now Carolyn Cole, Los Angeles Times Mark Andol, owner and creator of the "Made in America" store located in Elma, N.Y. ELMA, N.Y. (TNS) — When you stroll the aisles of the Made in America Store, you might notice a conspicuous absence. There is not a single item for sale that requires a battery or a plug. That is because no electronics meet the strict guidelines of an emporium that stocks only products 100 percent made in America. Still, American-made goods abound — socks and hiking boots, plastic lawn furniture, flags and decals, beer and barbecue sauce, mops and sponges. Toilet paper. There are three aisles of toys, non-electronic, that veer toward the nostalgic: playing cards, horseshoes, marbles and jacks, boomerangs, Slinkies, perhaps their best-selling item. Checkers and Chinese checkers. (Not the kind made in China.) The Made in America Store is the brainchild of Mark Andol, 50, an energetic, mile-a-minute talker with silver-tinged, waved-back hair and a wispy mustache. Andol, the third generation of a Greek immigrant family, was raised on American manufacturing. His father was an ironworker employed at the Ford stamping plant in nearby Buffalo and his mother made xylophone keys for a subcontractor of Fisher-Price, the toy company headquartered in nearby East Aurora. Andol was frustrated that his welding company, which made metal parts for industry, kept losing contracts to cheaper Chinese competitors. So on a whim, in 2010, he rented a vacant automobile dealership to showcase American products. “Sure, Mark. The world is fully of crazy people. Go for it,” Andol recalls he was told. Filling the cavernous building proved more difficult than Andol imagined. At first he carried only 50 products. He had set a standard higher than the Federal Trade Commission, requiring that the products be 100 percent U.S. made “right down to the glue in the packaging.” Andol was familiar with the certification procedures because he sometimes bid on military contracts, which give preference to U.S. suppliers under a 1941 law called the Berry amendment. He would pore over binders with letters certifying the origins of the components only to be crushed when he had to dump a product that did not make the cut. “I was so excited to find tea from the United States because I’m a tea drinker, but then I found out the bags were made in Japan and I had to kick it out of the store,” he said. In homage to his mother’s past making xylophone keys, Andol badly wanted to sell toys from Fisher-Price, which has its headquarters just two miles away. “They used to have model builders, toy makers, engineers working here, but now they are all gone and only the corporate headquarters is here,” Andol said. “I couldn’t find one Fisher-Price toy completely made in America.” Other retailers are trying an all-American approach, but it is a constant struggle. Today, Andol boasts that he stocks 7,000 items, although admittedly the numbers get a boost from some products that are essentially the same but come in different sizes or colors. He has opened several branch stores and sells online. Shoppers in search of a specific item would be advised to head to Wal-Mart. But the novelty of shopping American is enough of an adventure that the Made in America flagship attracts more than 600 tour buses annually. The store is decked out in an American theme, the walls covered with large completely American-made American flags. (The U.S. imports about $4 million in American flags from China each year.) T-shirts are plastered with the store’s slogan, “Because China is a long drive to work!” For all the anti-China rhetoric, some of the best customers are Chinese tourists. “The Chinese go ballistic buying stuff in there because it is made in America, not made in China,” said Eric Bateman, a tour bus operator from Conrad, Iowa, who brings tourists on their way to Niagara Falls. “Mark sells these great, simple things. You can buy a can opener and put it in the dishwasher and it doesn’t rust.” Bringing manufacturing back to the United States — and preserving manufacturing still here — is seen as the holy grail of economic revival for many policymakers and politicians. “My administration will follow two simple rules: Buy American, and hire American,” Donald Trump declared at a postelection victory rally in Des Moines last year. And yet they are elusive goals, many economists say. “We live in a world today where you have very complex interdependent supply networks,” said Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School who has written extensively on the need for a U.S. manufacturing revival. “One of the challenges with technology is that you have a lot of high-value components from various sources.” From experience, Andol knows that hiring American labor can be as difficult as sourcing American products. At his manufacturing shop, he is struggling to find skilled welders, fabricators and engineers, and the people he hires are undoubtedly more expensive than foreign workers. “If I took my $2.4 million payroll overseas, I’d be paying $400,000,” Andol said. “But you need to support the country you live in too.” Andol is enthusiastic about President Trump’s promises to bring back American goods, though a little disappointed that Trump and his daughter Ivanka had so much of the clothing they sell manufactured outside the U.S. “I think it is very hard, but I personally know clothing can be made here… and some of what we sell is cheaper than the imports,” he said. To prove his point, Andol explains his own wardrobe. He wears Texas Jeans (which are actually made in Ashville, N.C.), Wigwam socks, Thorogood work boots. It’s all made in America — right down to the underwear, belt and the wallet he carries. The only notable except is what he always carries: the iPhone.

In the January-June period of 2016, Bangladesh exported €567.97 million worth of denim products to the 28-nation bloc -- enough to secure a 21.18 percent market share, the highest. The country has also become the third largest denim supplier -- after China and Mexico -- to the US. It exported $186.30 million worth of denim products to the US, registering a 12.03 percent market share, eclipsed only by China (26.04 percent) and Mexico (25.40 percent). The headway has been possible because of the millions of dollars that the local denim fabrics makers invested to set up state-of-the-art facilities in their plants. Currently, Bangladesh has 30 denim mills for which investment to the tune of $1 billion was made, said Mostafiz Uddin, managing director of Denim Expert Ltd, a leading denim exporter. The collective production capacity of the mills is 435 million yards a year, he said. “Bangladesh could win in the European denim segment not only for the competitive prices, but also for the quality of its products, shorter lead time and better commitment,” said MS Hasan, director of operations of Amber Denim, another major denim maker. For instance, Amber Denim invested heavily to acquire a modern denim laboratory for testing and certification, which helped in reducing the lead time, he said. In terms of denim sales, the US and the UK are two major markets of Bangladesh. Almost 70 percent of the population in the US wear denim products regularly, according to industry insiders. An average consumer owns seven denim products at any given time, they said. Over in the UK, one of the largest clothing markets in Europe, each consumer owns an average of 17 denim garments. Bangladeshi entrepreneurs supply denim products to major global retailers including Levi's, Diesel, G-Star RAW, H&M, Uniqlo, Tesco, Wrangler, s.Oliver, Hugo Boss, Walmart, and Gap. The denim sub-sector could play a significant role in achieving the $50 billion export target by the end of 2021, said Mostafiz Uddin, who organises denim expositions twice a year in Bangladesh. Annually 2.1 billion pieces of denim are sold globally, according to Bangladesh Denim Expo, the organiser of the exposition. In 2014, the size of the global denim market stood at $56.20 billion, Mostafiz said. By 2020, the global denim market will reach $64.1 billion, while Bangladesh's denim export is forecasted to reach $7 billion by the end of 2021. It is estimated that the global denim market will grow by about 8 percent a year until 2020, Mostafiz said citing data from the Cotton Inc USA.     Leave your comments Comment Policy Top News View More Most Popular Stories Popular In Business Even divorce could not keep her safe Suicide bomber in Iraq is Neaz from Chittagong ‘Suicide blast’ kills ‘bomber’ at Dhaka Rab barracks Child’s body found at Ctg militant den A defeat too hard to swallow for Sri Lanka India's Proposed Defence Pact: Dhaka uneasy Meme on Shakib goes viral Private banks book hefty net profits Behind the “RAW” tirade Bangladesh overtakes China as top denim supplier to EU Bangladesh overtakes China as top denim supplier to EU Private banks book hefty net profits Bangabandhu satellite may be ready before time First direct international flight lands at Sylhet airport SC asks govt to return Tk 615cr to 16 companies Ha-Meem Group bets big on denim Singapore city infrastructure No. 1: Survey Remittances: From America with love Renewable energy expo begins in Dhaka Malaysia ranks top in best countries to invest in 0 Share this with Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn E-mail Viber Copy this link Top News View More Latest from Star Live More from Business Uber president Jeff Jones quits, deepening turmoil BJMC takes up Tk 568cr project to make denim Dubai harvests desert sun at vast solar plant World Bank announces $57b in financing for Africa S Korea approaches WTO over China economic retaliation In case you missed it What next for our cricket?

The topic is a bill under discussion in Texas that would require insurance companies to cover the cost of hearing aids for children who are born with impaired hearing. Williamson sets up the debate his way: The case for the bill is exactly what you would expect, presented in exactly the way you would expect…For newborn children who can benefit from hearing aids, sooner is better: The sooner the hearing aids are in use, the better the child’s chances of normal language development. The case against the bill is exactly what you would expect, presented in exactly the way you would expect: Business groups oppose the mandate, as they oppose all additional mandates, arguing that such mandates increase the cost of health insurance for all Texans and for employers who provide insurance. This is seemingly a straightforward debate about values. Should children get hearing aids as soon as possible so that they have a good chance of normal language development, or should they be denied this health care so that Texans as a whole can enjoy slightly lower costs? But Williamson is too clever to debate on those terms. For him, it’s wrong to mandate that insurance plans cover anything, but it’s also wrong to deny children the opportunity to hear and develop normally. So the solution is to have the State of Texas man-up and offer to provide these hearing aids directly to the kids who need them. The state can budget for this (it would be expensive but not that expensive) and they can stop pretending that a mandate to an insurance company is anything other than a disguised social-welfare program. What motivates Williamson to take this stance? If you want to provide the benefit, then, for Pete’s sake, write the damned check. The alternative is not — no matter what our Democratic friends insist — getting insurance companies to pay for children’s hearing aids out of their profits and the bonuses of their fat-cat executives. What offends him isn’t the cost, since he’s happy to have Texas pay it. He’s not really concerned about the premiums people will have to pay, since that’s just a laundered way of paying the taxes that Texas would need in his preferred scenario. No, what bothers him is that when the state mandates something be covered in an insurance plan, it comes out of the “profits and the bonuses of their fat-cat executives.” Insurers might simply try to pass those costs along to subscribers in the form of higher premiums, but, contrary to the economic model that exists in the head of Bernie Sanders, companies do not have the power to unilaterally set prices. Companies in very competitive and price-sensitive businesses (think McDonald’s or Walmart) cannot simply raise consumer prices. And here I thought the problem with Obamacare was that there wasn’t enough competition to keep premiums low. In any case, I’d actually be fine with Texas paying for kids’ hearing aids instead of having it all washed through a for-profit insurance industry. It’s just that it’s kind of crazy to me that the motivation for doing that wouldn’t be to reduce cost by cutting out the middle man and instead would be to avoid cutting into the profits and bonuses of insurance executives. But it gets even more confusing, because Williamson certainly doesn’t want Texas to pay directly for kidney dialysis or chemotherapy or separating conjoined twins. That would destroy the health insurance industry and take socialism to level not seen outside the Veterans Administration. So, why hearing aids but not birth control pills or hysterectomies? There’s nothing really coherent here in terms of policy or principle. The only consistency is that Williamson thinks that health insurance executives shouldn’t suffer from anything that will interfere with their compensation, and that means that they should be able to sell crap insurance of any kind that they want with no regulation. If some benefit must absolutely be provided because the people in need are so sympathetic, then let the state do socialism in just those cases but no others.

McIntyre March 18, 2017 8:55 am EDT Print Email Tweet How badly off is J.C. Penney Co. Inc. (NYSE: JCP), at least in the eyes of Wall Street? Shares are down 84% in five years to just under $6. Over the same period, the S&P 500 is up 70% to 2,378. J.C. Penney’s stock price is an alternative way to pace its decline. Recently, analysis has focused on an implosion in same-store sales, revenue attrition, store closings and layoffs. J.C. Penney just announced a list of 138 stores it would soon close. Unquestionably, the share price is driven by results. J.C. Penney revenue has fallen from $13 billion in 2013 to $12.6 billion in the 2017. The bottom line over the same period has been a disaster. The company lost $985 million in its fiscal 2013, $1.39 billion in 2014, $717 million in 2015 and $513 million in 2016. J.C. Penney has moved back near breakeven, but it has had to dismantle much of its operations to do so. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) is often considered the villain in the J.C. Penney story. That is only partially true. The massive e-commerce company has taken business from most of the brick-and-mortar retail industry. However, J.C. Penney has been accused of operating stores that have not been updated, poor pricing policies and a lack of aggression online. Unlike Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT), J.C. Penney has not made any major acquisitions to prop up its e-commerce traffic. As the company announced the list of 138 stores it is about to close, Marvin R. Ellison, chairman and chief executive officer of J.C. Penney, said: We believe the relevance of our brick and mortar portfolio will be driven by the implementation of these initiatives consistently to a larger percent of our stores. Therefore, our decision to close stores will allow us to raise the overall brand standard of the Company and allocate capital more efficiently. “Brand standard” and capital allocation won’t help if people have abandoned J.C. Penney permanently, and there is plenty of evidence that is the case. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Douglas A.

(Carolyn Cole/Los Angeles Times) By Barbara Demick, Los Angeles Times Published: March 18, 2017, 6:05 AM A   A ELMA, N.Y. — When you stroll the aisles of the Made in America Store, you might notice a conspicuous absence. There is not a single item for sale that requires a battery or a plug. That is because no electronics meet the strict guidelines of an emporium that stocks only products 100 percent made in America. Still, American-made goods abound — socks and hiking boots, plastic lawn furniture, flags and decals, beer and barbecue sauce, mops and sponges. Toilet paper. There are three aisles of toys, nonelectronic, that veer toward the nostalgic: playing cards, horseshoes, marbles and jacks, boomerangs and Slinkies, perhaps their best-selling item. The Made in America Store is the brainchild of Mark Andol, 50, an energetic, mile-a-minute talker with silver-tinged, waved-back hair and a wispy mustache. Andol, the third generation of a Greek immigrant family, was raised on American manufacturing. His father was an ironworker employed at the Ford stamping plant in nearby Buffalo and his mother made xylophone keys for a subcontractor of Fisher-Price, the toy company headquartered in nearby East Aurora. Andol was frustrated that his welding company, which made metal parts for industry, kept losing contracts to cheaper Chinese competitors. So on a whim, in 2010, he rented a vacant automobile dealership to showcase American products. “Sure, Mark. The world is fully of crazy people. Go for it,” Andol recalled he was told. Filling the cavernous building proved more difficult than Andol imagined. At first he carried only 50 products. He had set a standard higher than the Federal Trade Commission, requiring that the products be 100 percent U.S. made “right down to the glue in the packaging.” Andol was familiar with the certification procedures because he sometimes bid on military contracts, which give preference to U.S. suppliers under a 1941 law called the Berry amendment. He would pore over binders with letters certifying the origins of the components only to be crushed when he had to dump a product that did not make the cut. “I was so excited to find tea from the United States because I’m a tea drinker, but then I found out the bags were made in Japan and I had to kick it out of the store,” he said. In homage to his mother’s past making xylophone keys, Andol badly wanted to sell toys from Fisher-Price, which has its headquarters just two miles away. “They used to have model builders, toy makers, engineers working here, but now they are all gone and only the corporate headquarters is here,” Andol said. “I couldn’t find one Fisher-Price toy completely made in America.” Other retailers are trying an all-American approach, but it is a constant struggle. Today, Andol boasts that he stocks 7,000 items, although admittedly the numbers get a boost from some products that are essentially the same but come in different sizes or colors. He has opened several branch stores and sells online. Shoppers in search of a specific item would be advised to head to Wal-Mart. But the novelty of shopping American is enough of an adventure that the Made in America flagship attracts more than 600 tour buses annually. The store is decked out in an American theme, the walls covered with large completely American-made American flags. (The U.S. imports about $4 million in American flags from China each year.) T-shirts are plastered with the store’s slogan, “Because China is a long drive to work!” For all the anti-China rhetoric, some of the best customers are Chinese tourists. “The Chinese go ballistic buying stuff in there because it is made in America, not made in China,” said Eric Bateman, a tour bus operator from Conrad, Iowa, who brings tourists on their way to Niagara Falls. “Mark sells these great, simple things. You can buy a can opener and put it in the dishwasher and it doesn’t rust.” Bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. — and preserving manufacturing still here — is seen as the holy grail of economic revival for many policymakers and politicians. “My administration will follow two simple rules: Buy American, and hire American,” Donald Trump declared at a postelection victory rally in Des Moines, Iowa, last year. And yet they are elusive goals, many economists said. “We live in a world today where you have very complex interdependent supply networks,” said Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School who has written extensively on the need for a U.S. manufacturing revival. “One of the challenges with technology is that you have a lot of high-value components from various sources.” From experience, Andol knows that hiring American labor can be as difficult as sourcing American products. At his manufacturing shop, he is struggling to find skilled welders, fabricators and engineers, and the people he hires are undoubtedly more expensive than foreign workers. “If I took my $2.4 million payroll overseas, I’d be paying $400,000,” Andol said. “But you need to support the country you live in too.” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Alcohol sales have surged at warehouse-club chain Costco, lifted in part by the cult status of Costco’s Kirkland Signature-branded liquors.  (Costco)   By Molly SmithBloomberg Sat., March 18, 2017 The holidays didn’t go well for Costco Wholesale, whose profit during the period missed analysts’ projections by the most in at least a decade. But there was something to raise a glass to: booze. Alcohol sales have surged at the warehouse-club chain, lifted in part by the cult status of Costco’s Kirkland Signature-branded liquors. Many customers swear by the private-label products, and some are even convinced that the spirits are actually top-shelf liquors such as Grey Goose and Tanqueray hidden behind Costco packaging. That’s helped set Costco’s beverages apart from other private-label fare, said David Schick, lead retail analyst at Consumer Edge Research. “They use very high-end producers — premium all the way up to super-premium and beyond,” he said. Alcohol brought in $3.8 billion for Costco in its latest fiscal year, with wine sales accounting for almost half of the total. The category has grown 46 per cent during the past five years, outpacing the company’s broader food and sundries segment, according to chief financial officer Richard Galanti. Article Continued Below Kirkland Signature has been key to its success. The retailer began selling wine under the brand in 2003, followed by spirits in 2007. It also has a line of craft beers. Emphasizing private-label products has lowered Costco’s average retail prices, but surging demand has offset that impact on sales, Galanti said. “Private label continues to grow as a dominant strategy in retail — especially when it migrates from being a ‘label’ to more of a ‘brand,’ which Kirkland has done,” said David Bassuk, managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners in New York. “Now it’s a well-known name and gives the consumer a perception of value and a good deal.” The sources of the beverages remain a mystery. Kirkland Signature items are produced by “various manufacturers,” said Annette Alvarez-Peters, who manages Costco’s beverage alcohol division, without naming providers. Schick and other analysts calculate that Costco’s markup on its alcohol is in the range of 10 per cent to 14 per cent — extremely low by industry standards. In contrast, most retail liquor stores add from 25 per cent to as much as 45 per cent, especially for premium items, according to Schick. “They’re doing the opposite of looking to cut corners,” he said. “They’re looking for maximum quality and minimum markup to drive value for the member.” It’s a bright spot at a challenging time for Costco. The company posted earnings of $1.17 a share last quarter, far short of analysts’ projections for $1.36. Industrywide food deflation and higher gas prices have brought a double-whammy to the retailer. Gross margin, another closely followed benchmark, missed estimates by the most in more than four years. Even a highly anticipated membership fee increase did little to placate investors, with the shares tumbling after the results were released. Of Costco’s 508 locations in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, it can sell beer and wine in more than 80 per cent of them, according to Alvarez-Peters. Hard alcohol is less common, due to tougher local restrictions. About 60 per cent of the stores offer spirits. By comparison, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world’s largest retailer, sells wine and/or spirits in about two-thirds of its 4,700 stores. While Wal-Mart doesn’t break out those sales in its quarterly results, Piper Jaffray Cos. senior retail analyst Sean Naughton said he’d be surprised if Costco wasn’t the leader. “They’re taking share away from everyone because they can offer the lowest price.” Other retailers and grocers are trying to mimic Costco’s success. In 2003, Target Corp. introduced a private label — Target Wine Cube — to tap into premium boxed wines, and it’s currently exploring private label opportunities in other alcohol categories. Adult beverage was the fastest-growing division at the company last year. Whole Foods Market Inc. launched its Criterion Collection wines in 2015 and now has 10 varieties of reds and whites. To boost the brand, the company brought Devon Broglie on as a global beverage buyer. He is one of 236 experts around the globe with the designation of “master sommelier.” While alcohol laws vary by state, Issaquah, Wash.-based Costco has faced some of its toughest liquor legal battles in its own backyard. The retailer was the largest backer of an almost $23-million initiative to privatize Washington state liquor stores in 2011. That ballot measure succeeded, after revisions were made to a previous initiative that failed, and inspired grocers in other states to oppose state-run alcohol sales. “There’s a lot of politics involved for each state,” Naughton said. Even so, “there’s a very consistent demand that doesn’t fluctuate that much as we believe alcohol is a nondiscretionary purchase for many consumers — regardless of economic conditions.” With an average of 250 items across the three alcoholic beverage categories, Costco is selective in what it chooses to stock. It rotates items in and out of the system in what it calls a treasure hunt. “With the limited-item assortment, we constantly evaluate,” Alvarez-Peters said. “Every item must perform in volume.” The treasure hunt — along with the economics of bulk purchasing — are what keeps Costco members happy, Schick said. “When they buy something, they buy a lot,” he said. “This becomes quite powerful in alcohol.” Read more about: Costco Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

Domestic equity funds have been receiving greater slice of household savings for months in the wake of falling bank deposit rates. The upbeat mood, which took the 50-share Nifty index to a series of all-time highs last week, is being driven by heightened expectations that New Delhi would embark on tougher reforms needed to generate jobs for millions of people pouring into the workforce every year. Unlike China where communist diktats rule without any opposition, in India’s chaotic democracy the mantra of consensus holds sway to carry through policy initiatives. The process is painstakingly slow and impedes growth. It took 16 years for the central legislation for a Good and Services Tax (GST) to be passed in 2016; the reform was mooted in 2000. Despite winning a two-thirds majority in national elections in 2014 — and the first single-party majority in three decades — Modi faced obstacles to carry through reforms. The GST, which replaces multitude central, state and municipal levies and will help convert the subcontinent into a common market, is now expected to roll out from by July 1. After months of negotiations central and state finance ministers gave their final approval on Thursday to supporting legislation, and the government hopes to win parliamentary backing in the current session and in state assemblies by next month. Foreign funds have scooped up shares worth $2.9 billion (Dh10.6 billion) this year, most of it in February and March, after pulling out $4.6 billion between October and December last year. “The key driver is that the Modi administration is seen as getting a second term in 2019 and some more reforms can be expected. His hand was greatly strengthened by the outcome of the recent state elections where his party did so well,” Cameron Brandt, senior global analyst at Boston-based fund tracker EPFR Global, told ET Now television channel. “It does not hurt that a lot of the other standard matrix for India look pretty good — from growth rate to declining inflation. I definitely think that the perception of the economic reform stories were the key driver of the flows.” Reforms faith The biggest message that warmed the hearts of money managers and businesses alike was the vote of approval for Modi’s hard-nosed decision making, specifically his penchant to focus on the bigger picture. Last November, he stunned the nation by announcing a plan to suck out 86 per cent of the currency in circulation, causing havoc to cash supply and consumer spending. Amid restrictions on cash withdrawals, long winding queues, particularly of the middle and lower class, at bank counters hogged the limelight on TV channels for about 50 days. Opposition lawmakers and talking heads had a field day, cherishing the unpopular move would prove to be Modi’s Waterloo. The election to five state assemblies and municipal polls elsewhere were seen as a midterm referendum of the central administration. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) grabbed four-fifths of the legislature seats in Uttar Pradesh, the country’s most populous and impoverished state, indicating that people — particularly the poor and marginalised, cutting across religious and caste divides — believed the government’s explanation that demonetisation was necessary to combat tax dodgers and terror funding. Two steep increases in the price of non-subsidised cooking gas prices — by Rs. 65.50 per cylinder on February 1 just a few days before voting began and by another Rs. 86 on March 2 with two rounds of voting to go in Uttar Pradesh — underscored Modi’s leadership qualities to pursue sound economics over political compulsions. In contrast, the previous government of Manmohan Singh, a renowned economist, held prices of diesel low for 15 months between June 2011 and September 2012 even as world oil prices rose for more than a year, hoping this would enable Rahul Gandhi’s campaign to woo voters in Uttar Pradesh then. Singh’s inaction sent the fiscal deficit soaring, spurred production of more polluting diesel vehicles and hurt the economy severely. Noted political commentator Ashok Malik pointed out in an article in the Times of India that Modi’s decision to raise prices of cooking gas negated “the lazy assumption that the electorate rewards only populism and punishes a government taking hard decision”. “Despite the price rise, UP renewed its faith in Modi — not because it was happy to pay more [nobody ever is] but because it trusted Modi with doing the right thing,” he wrote. Policy push In a bid to create more jobs, New Delhi is considering easing rules for foreign retailers who are willing to sell more goods produced locally. Retailing is a sensitive issue in India where mom-and-pop stores, who are key supporters of BJP, control the sector. Being tiny operations, however, they are unable to invest in warehousing, hasten employment, provide better social security to workers nor give improved services to consumers. Under the proposal companies with a permit to sell local food items such as Amazon.com Inc that has applied for a licence, may be allowed to offer India-made stuff like toothpaste, soaps, cosmetics and so on for up to a quarter of their total sales. Also on the table is a proposal to allow more foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail such as Wal-Mart if they market local products. The underlying push behind the proposals is to provide a thrust to Modi’s “Make-in-India” campaign, which aims to make the country a manufacturing hub. Undoubtedly, what could immensely help in this endeavour lay in reforming labour rules, which are a stumbling block in shutting down uneconomical factories and weighs down investment in new manufacturing. Strong opposition from unionised labour, including that of the ruling alliance, makes it difficult for the central government to push through big changes. Still, the victory in provincial elections should provide a window of opportunity to get labour reforms rolling in the states. Already Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, controlled by the BJP, have embraced freer labour rules, which should lure more private-sector and foreign investments. Uttar Pradesh and other big states where the BJP is in power could follow suit, forcing opposition-ruled governments to fall in line or risk losing investments. Records on radar The top-30 Sensex and the broader Nifty surged 2.5 per cent each, their seventh weekly rise in eight weeks, and are poised to surpass their record highs, market participants say. While the Nifty hit an all-time high of 9,218.40 before closing at 9,160.05, the Sensex ended at 29,648.99 after touching 29,824.62 — within sight of its March 4, 2015, record of 30,024.74. “This rally has legs,” said equity strategist V. Venugopal. “It’s powered by liquidity, both domestic and foreign. Strong overseas inflows even after the Fed raised rates are a clear sign of how India is perceived in the economic growth potential and diminishing political risk.” “Modi has unleashed the animal spirits,” he added. “This is the single-most important factor for the markets.” Venugopal expects the Nifty to head towards 9,400 in the coming weeks. Porinju Veliyath, managing director and portfolio manager of Equity Intelligence India, believes the emergence of “development” as the central narrative — embraced even by caste and religious groups — in the elections was a sign of changing winds that augur well for investors. The election results were a mandate in favour of transforming India, and is a positive trigger that will take the current rally forward, he told BloombergQuint. Veliyath, whose stock picks have won laurels, is upbeat on Transport Corporation India Ltd, Tata Global Beverages Ltd and HSIL Ltd. “They are very unlikely to be disrupted by the world. Considering the structure of India’s demography and how these companies are big brands; they are the front-runners in many segments,” he told the financial news provider. “These companies have not really moved in the last few years, so they are safe bets.”   The writer is a journalist based in India.

Its most important targets are things that Trump and his followers resent— James Surowiecki (@JamesSurowiecki) March 17, 2017 Bloomberg: Four Republican Governors Come Out Against Obamacare Replacement Plan Four Republican governors told top lawmakers in the U.S. House and Senate that they oppose the current GOP plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, and that they want Congress to preserve an expansion of the Medicaid health program for poor Americans. In a letter Thursday, governors from Ohio, Nevada, Michigan and Arkansas wroteSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan and said the legislation the House is considering “does not ensure the resources necessary to make sure no one is left out, and shifts significant new costs to states.” They said the bill “does not meet” goals set out by President Donald Trump about state flexibility and making sure people are covered. x The most dangerous thing about DJT's coalition may be their belief that a border wall will make them safer than a well-functioning CDC— Conor Friedersdorf (@conor64) March 17, 2017 Ariel Edwards-Levy/HuffPost: Almost No One Likes The New GOP Health Care Bill And many people hate it. Americans are more likely to hate the GOP’s proposed health care bill than they are to even tepidly support it, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll. The top-line numbers alone aren’t good for the bill’s proponents: The public opposes the bill released by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and backed by President Donald Trump by a 21-point margin ― 45 percent to 24 percent ― according to the survey, with 31 percent unsure. The GOP plan also is on the wrong side of a significant gap in intensity, with just 5 percent strongly favoring the bill, and 32 percent strongly opposed. Leading the charge are voters who supported Hillary Clinton, nearly three-quarters of whom say they strongly oppose the bill. Seventy-nine percent expect that it would be worse than Obamacare, with 53 percent saying it would make things worse for them personally. Democrats are already counting the issue as a potential campaign vulnerability for the GOP. “The data shows that Democrats are well positioned to win back [Obama/Trump voters] in 2018 and 2020, particularly thanks to the debate over the controversial Republican healthcare plan to repeal the ACA,” the progressive group American Bridge argued in a polling memo released this week. Internal surveys for the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA found that Obamacare was a more “potent” topic than the fight over the Supreme Court, the group told CNN. x US reporters shocked when this German reporter asked #Trump: "Why do keep saying things you know are not true?" pic.twitter.com/dm79kI7RHe— Brent Goff (@brentgofftv) March 17, 2017 Vox: In these 105 counties, Planned Parenthood is the only full-service birth control clinic HHS Secretary Tom Price wanted to see a list of counties where Planned Parenthood is the only option for women who need subsidized birth control.

At issue is a process known as reconciliation, which allows certain bills to pass through the Senate with a simple majority (rather than the typical 60 votes) as long as all of its provisions meet a certain series of tests, which were spelled out decades ago in a rule named after the late Sen. Robert Byrd. Republican leaders have emphasized that they are working hard to get the best bill that they can through the Senate given the limitations, but conservatives argue that the current House bill favored by Speaker Paul Ryan doesn't go far enough in fully repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a true free market alternative. And they say the authors of the legislation are hiding behind the vagaries of the reconciliation process to justify some of the policy decisions that have angered conservatives. x Want to #SaveACA?

The city has tried setting up a needle exchange, hiring a drug czar, even suing the drug companies that brought pain pills to the state of West Virginia. None of those tactics have stopped the epidemic. “There doesn’t seem to be enough emphasis on what we’re losing,” John Wilson said, fighting the tears falling down his face. OTOH, Vann R.

To those who object to deep cuts in those programs, Mick Mulvaney, the president’s budget director, had a blunt message on Thursday: What did you expect? He said that after-school programs had failed to help children in schools, that housing programs were “not well run,” that government health research had suffered “mission creep” and that grants to local communities “don’t do any good.” x icymi, don't get @aaronecarroll mad https://t.co/zLRViCDGX5— Greg Dworkin (@DemFromCT) March 17, 2017 James Pethokoukis/The Week: What would a failed Trump administration look like? It certainly doesn't need to involve President Trump's impeachment and removal from office. Rather, imagine this: As the 2018 midterm elections approach, Trump's only accomplishment is starting construction on the southern border mega-wall. No ObamaCare replacement. No big tax cut. No big infrastructure plan. And millions of American voters are starting to consider that handing total power in Washington to a party led by a short-attention-span novice was a cosmically bad idea. It hardly seems like a far-fetched scenario right now. First, repealing and replacing ObamaCare, the GOP's top priority, was just dealt a hammer blow by the Congressional Budget Office. Conservative Republicans will surely focus on the CBO finding that the American Health Care Act would reduce projected debt by $300 billion and cut taxes by $900 billion over a decade. But the more relevant numbers to many Americans will be the 14 million people losing health insurance coverage next year and the 20 percent rise in insurance premiums if the bill becomes law. Republicans may quibble about details and degree, but the CBO forecast is almost certainly correct directionally. Priority two doesn't look a whole lot healthier. The GOP plan to deeply cut tax rates depends on the blueprint's controversial and deeply confusing border-adjustment provision, where imports would be taxed but exports wouldn't. Not surprisingly, the plan has split GOP business backers depending on whether they export goods (like Boeing) or import them (like Walmart). Dropping this provision — as seems highly probable — would blow a trillion-dollar revenue hole in a plan already counting on aggressive growth forecasts to avoid hemorrhaging red ink. x .@FreedomCaucus chairman: Despite changes, GOP healthcare bill doesn't have the votes https://t.co/QWbB9FkFCG— Scott Wong (@scottwongDC) March 17, 2017 x NEW CBO-DERIVED ESTIMATES: Coverage losses under the House bill by congressional district and coverage type. https://t.co/7gZu3wGQo5— Topher Spiro (@TopherSpiro) March 17, 2017 Alex Roarty/McClatchy: Centrist Democrats struggle to draft a survival strategy It was a secret meeting about an existential crisis. Gathered behind closed doors in a Denver hotel, 30 conservative Democrats plotted a potential path forward for their party – an effort to devise a strategy that might help them avoid total annihilation in red states across America. These political moderates had been called together by former Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, and they showed up out of fear that their party is growing more liberal by the day, and less interested in their centrist positions. x .@NPR is whipping the health care vote. https://t.co/XZvO5YUqQ1— Margot Sanger-Katz (@sangerkatz) March 17, 2017 I think the time to offer a Democratic fix to ACA has not arrived yet. I’d rather throw them an anvil while they are floundering. But for later: Pending  Horizon blog: No, really: Democrats should offer an ACHA alternative Some people on the left are rightly mocking Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) for saying Democrats who don't like the Republican Obamacare repeal-and-replace plan should put forward their proposal. After all, the Democrats' already did: it is the current law. But this is a good chance to highlight differences and drive home the problems with Trumpcare. While the ACA has gotten marginally more popular during this repeal fight, polling shows almost no one thinks the law is perfect, and most want to see it significantly improved. Democrats could quickly and easily put out a package based on already-scored ideas that would reduce premiums, increase coverage, and lower the deficit. It would do all the things Trump promised to do during the campaign but is now planning do the opposite of with his current repeal-and-replace plan. x CNN/ORC poll: Americans break with Trump on immigration policy @henryolsenEPPC @CNNPolitics https://t.co/gnTTtzDd7b— (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) March 17, 2017 336 Comments Share this article 141 141 141 336 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

Posted: Saturday, March 18, 2017 6:00 am Costco's private-label booze helps warm spirits during dry spell By Molly Smith Bloomberg News SentinelSource.com The holidays didn’t go well for Costco Wholesale, whose profit during the period missed analysts’ projections by the most in at least a decade. But there was something to raise a glass to: booze. Alcohol sales have surged at the warehouse-club chain, lifted in part by the cult status of Costco’s Kirkland Signature-branded liquors. Many customers swear by the private-label products, and some are even convinced that the spirits are actually top-shelf liquors such as Grey Goose and Tanqueray hidden behind Costco packaging. That’s helped set Costco’s beverages apart from other private-label fare, said David Schick, lead retail analyst at Consumer Edge Research. “They use very high-end producers — premium all the way up to super-premium and beyond,” he said. Alcohol brought in $3.8 billion for Costco in its latest fiscal year, with wine sales accounting for almost half of the total. The category has grown 46 percent during the past five years, outpacing the company’s broader food and sundries segment, according to Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti. Kirkland Signature has been key to its success. The retailer began selling wine under the brand in 2003, followed by spirits in 2007. It also has a line of craft beers. Emphasizing private-label products has lowered Costco’s average retail prices, but surging demand has offset that impact on sales, Galanti said. “Private label continues to grow as a dominant strategy in retail — especially when it migrates from being a ‘label’ to more of a ‘brand,’ which Kirkland has done,” said David Bassuk, managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners in New York. “Now it’s a well-known name and gives the consumer a perception of value and a good deal.” The sources of the beverages remain a mystery. Kirkland Signature items are produced by “various manufacturers,” said Annette Alvarez-Peters, who manages Costco’s beverage alcohol division, without naming providers. Schick and other analysts calculate that Costco’s markup on its alcohol is in the range of 10 percent to 14 percent — extremely low by industry standards. In contrast, most retail liquor stores add from 25 percent to as much as 45 percent, especially for premium items, according to Schick. “They’re doing the opposite of looking to cut corners,” he said. “They’re looking for maximum quality and minimum markup to drive value for the member.” It’s a bright spot at a challenging time for Costco. The company posted earnings of $1.17 a share last quarter, far short of analysts’ projections for $1.36. Industrywide food deflation and higher gas prices have brought a double-whammy to the retailer. Gross margin, another closely followed benchmark, missed estimates by the most in more than four years. Even a highly anticipated membership fee increase did little to placate investors, with the shares tumbling after the results were released. Of Costco’s 508 locations in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, it can sell beer and wine in more than 80 percent of them, according to Alvarez-Peters. Hard alcohol is less common, due to tougher local restrictions. About 60 percent of the stores offer spirits. By comparison, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world’s largest retailer, sells wine and/or spirits in about two-thirds of its 4,700 stores. While Wal-Mart doesn’t break out those sales in its quarterly results, Piper Jaffray Cos. senior retail analyst Sean Naughton said he’d be surprised if Costco wasn’t the leader. “They’re taking share away from everyone because they can offer the lowest price.” Other retailers and grocers are trying to mimic Costco’s success. In 2003, Target Corp. introduced a private label — Target Wine Cube — to tap into premium boxed wines, and it’s currently exploring private label opportunities in other alcohol categories. Adult beverage was the fastest-growing division at the company last year. Whole Foods Market Inc. launched its Criterion Collection wines in 2015 and now has 10 varieties of reds and whites. To boost the brand, the company brought Devon Broglie on as a global beverage buyer. He is one of 236 experts around the globe with the designation of “master sommelier.” While alcohol laws vary by state, Issaquah, Washington-based Costco has faced some of its toughest liquor legal battles in its own backyard. The retailer was the largest backer of an almost $23 million initiative to privatize Washington state liquor stores in 2011. That ballot measure succeeded, after revisions were made to a previous initiative that failed, and inspired grocers in other states to oppose state-run alcohol sales. “There’s a lot of politics involved for each state,” Naughton said. Even so, “there’s a very consistent demand that doesn’t fluctuate that much as we believe alcohol is a nondiscretionary purchase for many consumers — regardless of economic conditions.” With an average of 250 items across the three alcoholic beverage categories, Costco is selective in what it chooses to stock. It rotates items in and out of the system in what it calls a treasure hunt. “With the limited-item assortment, we constantly evaluate,” Alvarez-Peters said. “Every item must perform in volume.” The treasure hunt — along with the economics of bulk purchasing — are what keeps Costco members happy, Schick said. “When they buy something, they buy a lot,” he said. “This becomes quite powerful in alcohol.” Discuss Print Posted in Business on Saturday, March 18, 2017 6:00 am.

By COLLEEN LONG and DENISE LAVOIE Associated Press NEW YORK (AP) - A blustery late-season storm plastered the Northeast with sleet and snow Tuesday, paralyzing much of the Washington-to-Boston corridor but falling well short of the predicted snow totals in New York, Boston and Philadelphia. The powerful nor'easter, which came after a stretch of unusually mild winter weather that had people thinking spring was already here, unloaded 1 to 2 feet in many places inland, grounded more than 6,000 flights and knocked out power to nearly a quarter-million customers from Virginia northward. By the time it reached Massachusetts, it had turned into a blizzard, with near hurricane-force wind gusting over 70 mph along the coast and waves crashing over the seawalls. Boston ended up with 6.6 inches of snow, less than the predictions of up to a foot. It was easily the biggest storm in a merciful winter that had mostly spared the Northeast, and many weren't happy about it. "It's horrible," said retired gumball-machine technician Don Zimmerman, of Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, using a snowblower to clear the sidewalk along his block. "I thought winter was out of here. ... It's a real kick in the rear." While people mostly heeded dire warnings to stay home and off the roads, police said a 16-year-old girl was killed when she lost control of her car on a snowy road and hit a tree in Gilford, New Hampshire. In East Hartford, Connecticut an elderly man died after being struck by a snow plow truck. The storm closed schools in cities big and small, Amtrak suspended service and the post office halted mail delivery. Philadelphia and New York City got anywhere from a few inches of snow to around half a foot before the storm switched over mostly to sleet; forecasters had predicted a foot or more. In New Jersey, which saw rain or just a little snow in many areas, Gov. Chris Christie called the storm an "underperformer." But officials warned of dangerous ice. Inland areas, meanwhile, got hit hard. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Worcester, Massachusetts, received a foot or more of snow. The Binghamton, New York, area got over 2 feet, while Vernon, New Jersey, had at least 19 inches. The storm came just days after the region saw temperatures climb into the 60s, and less than a week before the official start of spring. February, too, was remarkably warm. "The winters seem to be upside down now. January and February are nice and then March and April seem to be more wintry than they were in the past," said Bob Clifford, who ventured out on an early morning grocery run for his family in Altamont, near Albany, New York. His advice: "Just hide inside. Hibernate." In the nation's capital, non-essential federal employees were given the option of reporting three hours late, taking the day off or working from home. The city got less than 2 inches of snow. A few days ago, workers on Washington's National Mall were making plans to turn on the fountains. "Obviously all that has to come to an abrupt stop until we get all the snow cleared," said Jeff Gowen, the acting facility manager for the National Mall and Memorial Parks. "The cherry blossoms, they're right on the cusp of going into bloom here. I had a feeling this was going to happen." Kelly Erskine, a 28-year-old coffee shop manager from Whitman, Massachusetts, about 25 miles south of Boston, made it almost all the way through the winter without a shovel. She went to Walmart on Tuesday morning to get one. "I live in an apartment complex and they usually take care of the shoveling, but they sent a letter to us and said, 'Expect a lot of snow.' I knew from the letter that I'd have to go out and buy a shovel," she said. As the storm closed in, the National Weather Service used terms like "life-threatening" and urged people to "shelter in place," language that has come to be associated with mass shootings. In the end, the line between snow and rain shifted slightly to the west, sparing some of the Northeast's big cities. Government meteorologists realized by late Monday afternoon that there was a good chance the storm wasn't going to produce the giant big-city snow totals predicted. But they didn't change their forecast for fear people would mistakenly think the storm was no longer dangerous, said Greg Carbin, chief of forecast operations at the Weather Prediction Center. In Pennsylvania, snowplows and state troopers escorted a 23-month-old child in need of a heart transplant 80 miles between hospitals. Gov. Tom Wolf said the youngster made the trip safely. In Narragansett, Rhode Island, high winds buckled a state-owned wind turbine. In New York City, two homes under construction collapsed near the waterfront in Far Rockaway. No injuries were reported. And two ponies broke out of their stables and roamed the snowy streets of Staten Island until an off-duty police officer wrangled them with straps normally used to tow cars and tied them to a lamppost. They were taken back to the stables. "We want to thank our cowboy officer," Mayor Bill de Blasio said. The storm coincided with New Hampshire's Town Meeting Day, a Yankee tradition in which voters in more than 100 communities elect local politicians and set budgets. Some towns postponed because of the snow. But in Hopkinton, a steady stream of voters braved the blustery conditions to make it to the polls. "You know, they're hardy New Englanders, and they're coming to vote," said Debbie Norris, a candidate for the Hopkinton Budget Committee. The flight cancellations included nearly 3,300 in the New York City area alone. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at airports. Laura and Matthew Balderstone of West Yorkshire, England, intended to spend their honeymoon in Florida but found themselves stuck at the Newark, New Jersey, airport and couldn't find a hotel room. "It's better safe than sorry, especially flying. I suppose it's a shame that we can't get another way around this," Matthew Balderstone said. "It's just the way it is, unfortunately." ___ Lavoie reported from Whitman, Massachusetts.

EVERETT — Anthony Box quickly left the courtroom Monday after a jury convicted him of causing a crash that claimed the life of a 17-year-old Sultan girl. It took jurors just three hours to find Box, 19, guilty of vehicular homicide and three counts of vehicular assault. Prosecutors alleged that Box huffed aerosol computer cleaner Nov. 12, 2015, before losing control of his vehicle on U.S. 2 between Sultan and Monroe. Box’s car veered off the highway, launched into the air and tumbled end over end into a gully. Madison Whiddon, the front seat passenger, was ejected. She died instantly upon hitting the ground, jurors were told. Three other teens also were injured in the crash, including Whiddon’s 14-year-old sister. Box was not seriously hurt. After the verdict was read Snohomish County deputy prosecutor Tobin Darrow asked the judge to have Box taken into custody. The defendant had previously posted bond and has been free leading up to and during the trial. Box is facing up to 16 years in prison when he’s sentenced later this month. Public defender Gabe Rothstein argued that his client isn’t a flight risk. He’s shown up for every court hearing and had no previous criminal convictions. Superior Court Judge Joe Wilson agreed to allow Box to remain out of custody as long as he gets a $25,000 bond reissued by tomorrow. “I see no reason to take him into custody immediately,” Wilson said. Jurors were told that Box, Whiddon and others had been huffing computer cleaner hours before the crash. The group ran out and decided to drive to Walmart in Monroe to get more. Witnesses said Box was inhaling during the drive back. He told police that he passed out right before the crash. Box’s blood later was drawn and tested positive for difluoroethane, a chemical found in computer cleaner. Once inhaled, difluoroethane cuts off oxygen to the brain. Users report feeling a sense of euphoria. Inhaling the cleaner also can cause people to black out. Rothstein had argued that Box never intentionally inhaled the cleaner while he was driving. He claimed that Whiddon had been spraying the cleaner in the car, robbing the small space of oxygen. Box inadvertently inhaled the cleaner and then passed out, Rothstein said. Madison’s sister testified that Box was huffing the cleaner on the way to Monroe, even pretending to pass out while he was driving. She asked him not to use while he was driving.

Larzell F. Williams, 23, was charged with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct and was released on his own recognizance when arraigned by Magisterial District Judge John Hasay, Shickshinny, Thursday. Arrest papers state he went to City Hall, 40 N. Church St., Thursday at 11:10 a.m., upset because he got a parking ticket the day before and paid it and then received a second parking ticket Thursday. As the officer explained a ticket can be issued every 24 hours, Williams began cursing and insulting the officer, court papers state. Informed he was under arrest for disorderly conduct, Williams continued yelling and cursing and as he was placed in custody, police wrote, resisted arrest until police placed him on the ground where they were able to put handcuffs on him. Child alerts police to threat maker Hazleton police say they arrested a city man after threats were made inside a residence Thursday. Nenad Vlaici, 30, was charged with terroristic threats and harassment. He was taken to jail after failing to post $500 bail set Thursday by Magisterial District Judge John Hasay, Shickshinny. Arrest papers state Vlaici told police he was arguing with everyone inside an apartment at 426 W. Maple St., but one of the victims said he threatened to kill her and tried breaking into her bedroom during a dispute over money. A 9-year-old inside the home called police around 2 p.m. to report the domestic incident, police wrote. Tip leads police to man with drugs Hazleton police say they caught a city man with cocaine in December. James A. Bell Jr., 54, faces possession of a controlled substance and use or possession of drug paraphernalia for the Dec. 30 offense at 11:30 p.m. The charges were filed against him March 1 and issued via summons, which he accepted March 8. Bell, arrest papers state, was apprehended that day after police saw him in the 600 block of McKinley Street, where they were called to investigate suspected drug activity. Bell matched the description of the suspect, police wrote, and upon searching him police found a small bag of cocaine. A woman recently was charged with stealing medicine in February, court papers say. Hannah C. Banditelli, 19, of East Street, Coaldale, faces possession of a controlled substance and possession of a misbranded controlled substance by Lansford police. She was arraigned Feb. 26 by Magisterial District Judge Casimir Kosciolek, Lansford, who set bail at $2,500. Her bail was since reduced to unsecured and she was released. Arrest papers state Banditelli stole carisoprodol and chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride from 217 E. Bertsch St. on Feb. 2. A Carbondale couple took a Freeland man’s car without permission, court papers say. Daniela M. Wilbur, 36, faces theft, receiving stolen property and unauthorized use of motor vehicles, after she took her brother’s car, arrest papers state. Her boyfriend, Paul F. Cosgrove Jr., 35, faces the same charges. They were both released on $7,500 unsecured bail by Magisterial District Judge Daniel O’Donnell, Sugarloaf, who arraigned Wilbur on March 7 and Cosgrove on March 6. Arrest papers state the pair took the car July 23 from 217 Washington St., Freeland, after Wilbur’s brother refused to give them a ride to 28 Powderly Drive in Carbondale. The vehicle, court papers state, was found by state police at Gibson crashed on Route 92 in Susquehanna County after hitting a fence and utility pole. A Jim Thorpe woman was high when she was driving through Weatherly with a child in her vehicle, court papers say. Jennifer E. Gizerian, 33, faces driving under the influence of a controlled substance, reckless endangerment, possession of marijuana and a summary offense after Weatherly police stopped her vehicle Jan. 5 on Hudsondale Street near East Main Street at 2 p.m. for an expired registration, arrest papers state. The charges were filed against her March 2 and issued via summons, which she accepted March 9. Court papers state she failed field sobriety tests and her blood later tested positive for marijuana. She told police she is an occasional marijuana user and smoked it earlier that day inside the vehicle. Gizerian also handed police a mint tin with marijuana in it. Police said she had a 10-year-old in the vehicle when they stopped her and that the marijuana in the tin weighed .6 grams. An Orwigsburg man pushed a woman out of a moving commercial vehicle in Tamaqua, court paper say. Gregory J. Ney, 36, faces two counts simple assault and one count each criminal mischief, reckless endangerment and aggravated assault. He was released on $25,000 unsecured bail by Magisterial District Judge Stephen Bayer, Tamaqua, March 7. Arrest papers state the victim was with Ney in his tractor-trailer Feb. 16 and wanted to leave his company when Ney pulled her back inside by her hair and told her she wasn’t allowed to leave before he smashed her phone. He threatened her with a loaded rifle, court papers state, and while south on Route 209, outside Sisters Restaurant, 1315 E. Broad St., he pushed her from the moving vehicle, leaving her with bruises on both arms and scrapes on her left leg, court papers state. A Tamaqua man entered a store he was banned from and now faces a count of defiant trespass, police say. Rush Township police filed the charge against James Bloss, 61, on the day of the incident, Feb. 23, and issued it via summons which he accepted Feb. 27. Arrest papers state Bloss was issued a trespass notice after his last arrest at Wal-Mart in Hometown and told not to re-enter the property. He admitted to knowing he wasn’t supposed to be back in the store when police apprehended him but said he went inside for a kid’s toy, according to court papers. Tamaqua police say they found methamphetamine on a wanted man March 6. George M. Cope, 30, was charged with manufacture, delivery or possession with intent to deliver, possession of a controlled substance and use or possession of drug paraphernalia. He was taken to jail after failing to post $50,000 bail set by Magisterial District Judge Stephen Bayer, Tamaqua, the day of his arrest. Arrest papers state an off-duty officer observed Cope, who was wanted, enter Turkey Hill, 330 E. Broad St., around 8 a.m. and contacted on-duty officers, who arrived to find Cope trying to hide behind shelves in the back of the store. He was taken into custody and found with a large folding knife and a total of 14.8 grams of methamphetamine, police wrote. A fire alarm at a Nesquehoning apartment building led borough police to a stash of marijuana, court records say. Crystal L. Miller, 37, faces possession of marijuana, use or possession of drug paraphernalia and tampering with evidence after the Jan. 29 fire call at 6:49 p.m., which police and fire were dispatched to. Jessie Steigerwalt, 29, was charged with possession of marijuana and use or possession of drug paraphernalia. The charges were filed against both March 7 and issued via summons, which they both accepted March 10. Arrest papers state the alarm sounded at 1 W. Garibaldi Ave., an apartment building, and police arrived to find Steigerwalt standing in a doorway. Inside the apartment, police said, they smelled marijuana and saw young children in the unit with Miller. Both adults denied knowing why the apartment unit smelled like weed, arrest papers state, but upon searching the residence officers found a small bag of marijuana, a digital scale and a marijuana smoking pipe they say Miller was trying to put in a bag. A Blakeslee woman lied about an assault, court papers say. Alexis R.A. Soto, 21, was charged with a misdemeanor for false reports and a summary count of harassment in relation to a March 3 claim she made when Summit Hill police responded to an assault at 206 W. Hazard St., arrest papers state. The charges were filed against her March 6 and issued via summons, which she accepted Monday. A Coaldale man took money for a construction job but never did the work, police say. As a result Lansford police charged Joseph T. Slakoper, 78, with felonies for theft by deception, deceptive business practices and receiving stolen property. He was released on $100 unsecured bail by Magisterial District Judge Casimir Kosciolek, Lansford, on March 10. Arrest papers state Slakoper was issued and cashed a $2,100 check from the property owner to begin work at 527 E. Bertsch St. in April 2015 and never performed the work. Despite several attempts to repay the victim, police wrote, he never paid him back. A domestic dispute in Tamaqua, court papers say, ended with one borough woman facing charges. Barbara Francis, 48, was charged with simple assault and harassment by Tamaqua police. She was released on $10,000 unsecured bail by Magisterial District Judge Stephen Bayer, Tamaqua, the day of the incident, March 9. Arrest papers state the victim said Francis threw keys at her, causing a bleeding cut above her eye, at 310 Arlington St. just before 10 p.m. A wanted Sugarloaf Township man was found with drug paraphernalia when he was taken into custody March 10, court papers say. Justin E. Reimiller, 26, was taken into custody March 10 on a warrant after police found he was at his parents’ home on Conyngham-Drums Road. Though he fled inside the home from the front porch upon seeing police pull into the driveway, Reimiller was taken into custody without incident, arrest papers state. He had six empty heroin packets under his mattress and a syringe and spoon in his bathroom, resulting in the charge, police wrote. Reimiller faces use or possession of drug paraphernalia and was released on $5,000 unsecured bail March 13 by Magisterial District Judge Daniel O’Donnell, Sugarloaf. He’s also accused in another case involving the Feb. 24 theft of a pair of Air Jordan Retro 8 sneakers. The owner said the shoes were part of a collection and not to be used or worn, court papers state, and Reimiller didn’t have permission to take them. Police found Reimiller took them and traded them for heroin. He was charged with theft by township police for that incident on March 13. A Blakeslee man faces charges after an alleged March 3 assault in Summit Hill. Alex Benton, 24, was charged with simple assault and harassment by Summit Hill police. The charges were filed against him March 6 and issued via summons, which he accepted March 13.

She was taken to jail after immediately failing to post $5,000 bail set March 11 by Magisterial District Judge Eric Schrantz, Jim Thorpe. A Nissan Maxima was taken from Oplinger’s relative’s house, arrest papers state, and later spotted by a resident on Held Road in Franklin Township. Oplinger was taken into custody later that day during a traffic stop and admitted she wasn’t given permission to take the vehicle, police wrote.

(IBJ photo/Eric Learned) Struggling Marsh Supermarkets has stopped paying rent on six Indianapolis stores, a move that might suggest the struggling chain is preparing to close them to shore up finances. Marsh said it doesn’t comment on the status of specific locations but acknowledged in an emailed statement that the cutthroat grocery industry is prompting the company’s decision to further reduce its footprint. The Fishers-based chain has not paid monthly rent at the locations since fall, per lawsuits filed this year by property owners. They’re attempting to collect a total of at least $480,000 in unpaid rent and property taxes, in addition to other expenses. The chain has steadily shrunk since Florida-based Sun Capital Partners acquired it in 2006 for $88 million in cash and the assumption of $237 million in debt. Marsh, which had 120 groceries when the deal closed, now has 67. Closing the six locations where it has halted rent payments would accelerate that trend, reducing the store count to 61. “We are working hard to operate our business effectively in a highly competitive industry, and that means making difficult decisions about a few stores that are no longer viable,” Marsh said in its statement. “Although store closures are part of the normal course of operations in the grocery and retail industries, we are making every effort to reduce the impact on our community, customers, and employees,” the company continued. “This includes working to find positions for our associates at other Marsh store locations. Our overall goal is always to serve customers well and put our company in the best position for future success and growth.” Told about Marsh’s statement, one landlord responded sarcastically. “It’s gratifying to see the owner of a longtime Indiana tradition taking care of their employees and communities,” said Erik Jansen, part of a Seattle-based ownership group that has sued Marsh over nonpayment of rent at its strip center at East 21st Street and North Post Road. “I trust they will be as respectful of their landlords that have kept that stewardship with them.” Another landlord suing Marsh is Kovacs Enterprises LLC, which owns the Marsh-anchored strip center at Madison Avenue and Stop 11 Road on the south side. The store recently notified customers it will close March 25. Neither Kovacs nor its attorney responded to messages from IBJ seeking comment on the lawsuit and store closing. But in court records, Kovacs and the other property owners assert they brought their cases after Marsh fell at least two months behind on rent. Veteran grocery analyst David Livingston said Marsh’s trail of unpaid bills reflects that it is an “ineffectual operator.” “The fact that it’s a multiple number of cases would indicate that there’s probably some cash-flow problems,” said Livingston, who runs DJL Research in Waukesha, Wisconsin. “I just don’t know of any viable company that arbitrarily starts to withhold rent.” Marsh, founded by the Marsh family in 1931, has struggled to compete in recent years in the face of withering competition from Kroger, Meijer, Wal-Mart and other larger chains. Except for the soon-to-close south-side store, locations where lawsuits say Marsh is no longer paying rent are concentrated on the east and west sides. The addresses are 2135 N. Post Road, 7481 Shadeland Ave., 6243 E. Washington St., 5104 N. Franklin Road, and 35 N. Lynhurst Drive. Marsh is also facing an unpaid-rent lawsuit filed by the landlord for a Shelbyville store that closed in 2011. Court documents say Marsh stopped paying on its lease in December, after failing for years to find a tenant to assume its obligations. Efroymson Veteran bankruptcy attorney Henry Efroymson said the company’s actions suggest financial pressures are escalating. “It’s sort of a recipe for a potential bankruptcy,” said Efroymson, a partner with Indianapolis-based Ice Miller LLP. “The fact that there are several payment defaults on leases would just confirm that suspicion.” The latest Marsh store closing occurred in late January. That location, near Keystone Avenue and 53rd Street, opened in 1957. It was the then-Muncie-based company’s first location in Indianapolis. The store was down the street from a newly opened Meijer. Marsh said in July that it has been boosting its competitiveness with an aggressive store-renovation program. It said it upgraded 25 stores over the last two years and that another 20 were in the planning stages. But not all contractors have been paid for their work, according to mechanic’s liens filed by contractors, further illustrating Marsh’s financial problems. Local mechanical contractor DEEM LLC filed liens in December and January on unpaid bills totaling $63,706. Other lien filings include Edwards Electrical & Mechanical on Shadeland Avenue, seeking to collect $32,730, and Gordon Plumbing Inc. in the Castleton area, on unpaid bills totaling $26,401. Sun, with more than $9 billion in capital under management, has the financial firepower to rescue Marsh if it chooses. But private equity firms, like any investor, aren’t prone to put in additional cash unless they’re confident they’ll earn a return on it. Private equity firms typically seek to sell off the companies they buy within six years. But Sun’s underinvestment in the stores has left it unable to attract a buyout offer from a competing chain, Livingston said. “That ship has sailed,” he said.•     Email Tweet ADVERTISEMENT Reporter Real estate, retail, legal issues Property Lines Real estate blog moderator Olson became real estate reporter in March 2013 after spending four years as online reporter for IBJ Daily.

News Patti LaBelle Announces New Album ‘Bel Hommage’ By Singersroom Published on March 15, 2017 Share Tweet 1 Comment Iconic singer Patti LaBelle will release the new album, Bel Hommage, on May 5, 2017. The project, her first in almost a decade, features a collection of jazz standard records. ‘Bel Hommage’ follows Patti’s 2008 Labelle reunion project, Back to Now. The physical CD is available for pre-order now and the digital album will be available for pre-order on March 24th. With more than 50 years in show business, LaBelle has recorded and performed music across multiple genres including R&B, disco, pop, and gospel. However, Bel Hommage marks her first foray into jazz. She grew up listening to many of the songs that she recorded for the project and has always admired artists such as Dinah Washington, James Moody, Nina Simone, Nancy Wilson and Frank Sinatra, who’ve made these standards famous. “I’ve been saying for years that I was going to record a jazz album, but I hadn’t taken that leap of faith to try something different,” says LaBelle. “Now I’m so happy that I did because I really love all of these songs and I pray that everyone else will too!” In addition to ‘Bel Hommage,’ LaBelle is releasing her sixth book and fourth cookbook, Desserts LaBelle, on April 25th and has a line of successful food products, Patti’s Good Life, which is carried at Walmart stores. She also stars on the hit Cooking Channel show, Patti LaBelle’s Place. ‘Bel Hommage’ Track Listing: 1. The Jazz In You 2. Wild Is The Wind 3. Moanin’ 4. Till I Get It Right 5.

Charmaine Cleveland/ The Californian A participant shows her sign to a friend at the 2017 Women's March in downtown Bakersfield. 10 THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW: Today’s guide to the obscure, the possibly relevant and things in between THE BAKERSFIELD CALIFORNIAN Mar 17, 2017 0 +1  Raiders quarterback Derek Carr passes against the Chargers during the second half last season in Oakland. Marcio Jose Sanchez / AP 1. Derek Carr sure knows how to make Bakersfield look good. We’re referring to when the Raiders quarterback, also the good Samaritan in this story, stopped to help a motorist who ran out of gas in Dublin, according to the San Jose Mercury News. Music producer Ron Reeser was getting ready to walk toward a gas station when a man in a black SUV pulled up. “The man asked me if everything was OK,” Reeser said. “I said I ran out of gas. He said, `Hop in, I’ll take you.’” The two got to talking about life. “He says `I play football and is heavily into God and wants to become a pastor some day when he retires,” Reeser said. And the football conversation continued. “He said he was a quarterback,” Reeser said. “I asked him what string he was. He said ‘first string.’ I asked him his favorite team. He said, ‘I may be biased, but the Raiders because I play for them.’ I looked at him and said, ‘Wait’ … and I asked him his name. He said ‘Derek Carr.’" “He couldn’t have been more down to earth,” Reeser added. 2. The Mercury News reports that Reeser acknowledged Carr may have changed his fan allegiance. “I’ve grown up a Niners fan,” Reeser said. “But the last year was pretty tough, and after my experience with Derek, I just may become a Raiders fan now.” Reeser tweeted, “thank u for the help & prayer today @derekcarrqb you've restored my faith in humanity & appreciate u taking the time #godbless #payitforward” And Carr responded, “God bless you too! Anytime!!!! But hopefully not on the side of the road again haha” Good job Carr! Way to convert one football fan at a time. 3. Get your calendars out.

A cooler donated to Goodwill in Washington on Monday was full of weed. People are so charitable these days. While it's legal in Washington for people over 21 to possess one ounce of cannabis, this stash of five large bags was 60 times over the limit, CNN says. "We went over there and they opened the lid and in there was five large bags of marijuana," Debbie Willis of the Monroe Police Department said. "Normally when we go there, it is for a shoplifter, but not anything like this." The police are trying to track down the owner, and many people have been claiming the cooler belongs to them on social media, but no one has come to pick up the pot of gold. +1  A participant shows her sign to a friend at the 2017 Women's March in downtown Bakersfield. Charmaine Cleveland/ The Californian 5. We know Trump’s inauguration happened a while ago, but we have a new interesting fact to share with you. Bloomberg reports that Americans spent $6 million on sign-making supplies the week of President Trump’s inauguration and the Jan. 21 Women’s March. That’s more than a 30 percent jump over normal levels. According to Bloomberg, sales of foam boards rose 42 percent. Poster board sales grew 33 percent, and in the week before the inauguration, stores sold roughly one-third of the 6.8 million poster boards sold in January. Paint markers and fabric paint for T-shirts also sold more briskly than normal, said Leen Nsouli, director of industry analysis for office suppliers at NPD. 6. A 29-year-old named Joe Davis will be taking over Vin Scully’s spot. No pressure. Davis, an announcer from Michigan, was born five years after Scully was honored by the Baseball Hall of Fame in the 1980s. Los Angeles Times sportswriter Bill Plaschke wrote in a recent column, “He’s actually really good, with a distinct voice that booms like Joe Buck’s, a keen eye for detail, an appreciation for drama, and a youthful enthusiasm that makes the Dodgers sound not only credible and professional, but fun.” A New York Times newsletter says Davis will be joined in the Dodgers booth by either Orel Hershiser or Nomar Garciaparra. 7. McDonald’s got a little political Thursday. It sent out a tweet about President Donald Trump, but the company said it was hacked, says Business Insider. The tweet, sent at 9:16 a.m. ET, said: "@realDonaldTrump You are actually a disgusting excuse of a President and we would love to have @BarackObama back, also you have tiny hands." According to Business Insider, the message was retweeted more than 600 times before it was deleted 25 minutes later. The tweet was also "pinned,” meaning it was featured at the top of the brand's Twitter page. Late Thursday, the company said "it was hacked by an external source." BI says McDonald's doesn't typically weigh in on politics, but the head of communications is Robert Gibbs, the former White House press secretary and senior campaign adviser to President Barack Obama. 8. Everyone enjoys leftover cold pizza for breakfast, until now. CNN says 21,000 pounds of pizza has been recalled over listeria concerns, U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service announced Wednesday. RBR Meat Company Inc. recalled its Marketside supreme frozen pizza. The pizzas were sold at select Walmart stores in a 50.6-oz. box containing single shrink-wrapped 16-inch pizzas labeled as "Marketside Extra Large Supreme Pizza," with lot code 20547, reports CNN. FSIS discovered the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria during a sampling routine. "There are no confirmed reports of adverse reactions from consumption of the pizzas at this time," according to the recall announcement. 9. Bakersfield Consumer Family Learning Center will open a new facility to the public on Monday, March 20. The new facility, located in the South Tower of the Behavioral Health and Recovery Services Administration Building, has large classrooms, art studios, social areas and offices for staff, treatment teams and volunteers. “Moving to this new location will allow us to offer more services at a more central location than before,” said program administrator Jamy Garcia. A news release says the Consumer Family Learning Center is a free community resource providing self-help classes, groups and peer support for people whose lives have been affected by mental illness and/or substance abuse issues. 10. California State University students plan to protest a proposed tuition increase on March 22 at the CSU Board of Trustees meeting in Long Beach. According to a news release, the board has proposed a 5 percent tuition increase, which would range from $270 to $1,048 depending on the level of degree. CSU tuition has increased 283 percent in the decade between 2002 and 2012, says the news release. Students argue "the board needs to prioritize spending and hold Governor Brown accountable for properly funding the CSU instead of forcing the burden onto the backs of students." On March 21, students, faculty and community allies will share their concerns with the board during public comment, and March 22 will be the official vote. For more information, call 530-640-1827.

Pret-a-Reporter Fashion Week New York Fashion Week London Fashion Week Milan Fashion Week Paris Fashion Week Reviews Beauty Red Carpet Retail Report Subscribe Newsletters Facebook Twitter Instagram Tumblr The Hollywood Reporter Billboard Subscribe Newsletters Pret-a-Reporter Fashion Week New York Fashion Week London Fashion Week Milan Fashion Week Paris Fashion Week Reviews Beauty Red Carpet Retail Report Indie Retailer Modcloth Acquired by Walmart 11:17 AM PDT 3/15/2017 by Sam Reed FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Courtesy of Modcloth Jet was recently acquired by Walmart. Today in weird retail happenings, it was reported that Modcloth — the quirky independent women's clothing retailer known as much for its progressive work environment and diversity as its assortment of feline-printed retro frocks — is being acquired by Jet.com, the Amazon wannabe which sells everything from laundry detergent to patio furniture, at the end of this week.  Jezebel first reported that Modcloth CEO Matthew Kaness revealed the news to his staff on Wednesday morning during an all-hands meeting at the company's headquarters. According to the site's sources, employees were audibly displeased upon receiving the news. Modcloth and Jet.com did not immediately return The Hollywood Reporter's request for comment. Founded in 2002 by Susan Gregg Koger and Eric Koger, Modcloth made a name for itself in the emerging e-commerce landscape as a hub for vintage fashions, specializing in retro dresses with kitschy and quirky patterns. Through on-brand messaging which championed diversity (in size, race and gender), the e-tailer grew to $150 million in revenue by 2014. The San Francisco-based brand also became known as one of the most progressive companies in fashion, paving the way by banning the term "plus-size" and being one of the first mainstream businesses to cast a transgender model. The company launched swimwear and bridal in 2016.  However in recent months, Modcloth has faced rounds of devastating layoffs, according to the Jezebel report.   Membership-based ecommerce site Jet.com, on the other hand, has been the internet's hottest e-commerce darling, drawing comparisons to Amazon for its breadth of product, as well as the $820 million it raised in funding. Last August, the company was sold to Walmart for $3.3 billion. Given Walmart's rocky track record over issues like minimum wage, sexist costumes and working conditions, Modcloth's acquisition by the discount giant is a head-scratcher, indeed.  Updated, Friday, March 17 1:45 p.m.: Walmart has confirmed the acquisition of Modcloth's operations and assets. The deal closed on March 17. Jet.com, however, is not mentioned in the release.  FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Sam Reed THRnews@thr.com HereReedThis Comments comments powered by Disqus The Hollywood Reporter © 2017 The Hollywood Reporter All rights reserved.

The mom’s official cause of death was drowning and exposure to the elements. The hero paramedic who rescued the baby from the mom’s nearly-submerged SUV met with reporters. He recalled how he swam to the vehicle after he stripped off his clothes and told other emergency workers, “I’ll go.” Those were some of the new developments Friday in the deaths of Cristy Campbell and her husband, Justin Campbell. But several questions remained unanswered, including the big one: Why? Justin Campbell, whose body was found Thursday morning in his burned home, died of a gunshot, Madison County Coroner Steve Nonn said Friday. The body of Justin Campbell, 37, was found Thursday morning after a fire at the home he shared with his wife and seven children at 15 Dogwood Lane in Glen Carbon. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 0:44 Belleville tightens rules for thrift shops Pause 1:11 Mark Smith scores 45 for Edwardsville in sectional final win 2:02 Edwardsville basketball star talks win over O'Fallon 0:30 Edwardsville basketball stars honored after tourney title 2:20 Edwardsville's Mark Smith talks 30-point game in tourney win 1:09 Edwardsville's AJ Epenesa talks about Mark Smith's 45-point performance 1:55 Super-sectional loss ends careers of Edwardsville's standout seniors 2:38 How to use the nutrition facts label to make healthier food choices 2:05 Sheriff confirms police had been to Glen Carbon home about 50 times 0:51 Children fleeing fatal fire, reflection of flames, caught on surveillance video Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Fire badly damages home on Dogwood Lane in Glen Carbon; coroner called The Madison County coroner was called to a house fire Thursday morning in Glen Carbon. klandis@bnd.com No bullet was found at the scene or during an autopsy, according to Nonn’s office.

Mike Dixon. “We don’t have all of the information, and everything isn’t known at this point in time.” An attorney who represented Cristy Campbell three years ago in a child-neglect case said none of the details fit with the woman he represented. “When I represented her, she was contrite, concerned, and she was polite — seemed like a caring mother,” Glen Carbon attorney Todd Taplin said. “This is a complete shock. I think it’s a complete shock to everybody.” When I represented her, she was contrite, concerned, and she was polite — seemed like a caring mother. This is a complete shock. I think it’s a complete shock to everybody. Attorney Todd Taplin, represented Cristy Campbell Cristy Campbell’s Facebook page includes multiple posts about her seven children who all survived the deaths of both their parents. There are several posts about her family, including vacation pictures, children performing well in sports, one child getting braces and one child receiving a Do The Right Thing award. Dixon said the answers might never be fully known. “There are a lot of questions, including the ‘why,’” he said. “That might be something that we always have to speculate on — we may never know the answer as to ‘why.’ Homicide never makes sense, if that’s what this is.” There are a lot of questions, including the why. That might be something that we always have to speculate on — we may never know the answer as to why. Homicide never makes sense, if that’s what this is. Madison County Sheriff’s Capt. T. Mike Dixon Firefighters were called about 5:30 a.m. to a blaze at Cristy Campbell’s home at 15 Dogwood Lane in Glen Carbon after children who resided in the home ran to a nearby Walmart for help. Six children who were in the home escaped unharmed. Justin Campbell’s body was found inside.

The death was connected wit Curt Libbra clibbra@bnd.com Sheriff John Lakin, at a news conference Thursday afternoon, said police had been called to the home about 50 times, for matters ranging from barking dogs to 911 hang-ups and domestic disputes. Dixon said those calls are part of the investigation. “Obviously, we’re looking into those issues to see if there’s some kind of motivating factor there,” he said. “We’re looking at everything.” Dixon said police have not been made aware of any health problems for Cristy Campbell. “As far as mental health, who knows. That’s something we may never know,” he said. “I don’t know that she’s seen a doctor for anything like that.

Mike Dixon Dixon said 15 or more investigators continued working on the case Friday. “Just to get the answers — to confirm absolutely that, yes, there is no longer any threat to the public,” Dixon said. “Everybody’s working hard to get the answers.” Taplin represented Cristy Campbell in 2014, when she was charged with a misdemeanor for allegedly allowing a 5-year-old child to leave their home unattended. The charges were dropped after she completed parenting classes. Taplin said he couldn’t discuss specifics of the case, but said Cristy Campbell “had a pretty good defense for that.” Taplin said his knowledge of Cristy Campbell is only through the court case, but he said he recalls her as “quite different from what’s being presented in the press in these articles.” Funeral arrangements for both Justin and Cristy Campbell were pending Friday. They are survived by the seven children. Six of the children escaped the house fire on Thursday morning. The seventh — the 3-month-old baby — was pulled from the vehicle that went into Silver Lake by Highland paramedic Todd Zobrist. Zobrist performed CPR on the baby before the infant was taken to a St. Louis hospital. The baby was expected to be released from the hospital Friday.

She was released from Denton County Jail on Friday after posting $10,000 bail. Wright is accused of pocketing about $21,000 from the bank account of what was then known as the Ponder Band Booster Club between August 2014 and December 2015. If convicted, Wright could face up to 10 years in state prison. Cely said Wright was the club's former president and had complete control over the group's finances from May 2014 to December 2015. Wright, whose three daughters attended Ponder High School, had been a member of the group for about seven years when she took over. The handful of active club members simply deferred to her at the time. "No one really said anything against what she thought, because we just thought she knew what she was doing," Cely said. A 14-month investigation starting in January 2016 revealed $21,685.36 either was unaccounted for or completely missing from the club's account at Bank of the West, according to a Ponder police arrest affidavit. As club officials closely scrutinized ATM withdrawals and transactions, they discovered Wright opened a secondary account in October 2014 without their knowledge, the affidavit said. Wright made several withdrawals and transactions from the secondary account as well as the club's main account, the affidavit said. Bank records showed multiple transactions at various stores and restaurants, including Wal-Mart, McDonald's, Sonic Drive-In, RaceTrac, QuikTrip and Spirit Halloween. Before club members were notified about the missing funds, the Ponder High band learned it was invited to participate in the 2016 Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl festivities, scheduled for Atlanta in December. The trip initially was canceled because of minimal funds in the bank, but local businesses and good Samaritans donated thousands of dollars to recoup the club's lost expenses, according to previous reports in the Denton Record-Chronicle. Among those donors, James Wood car dealerships in Denton and Decatur donated $20,000. Cely said the band was able to perform at the game because of the donations and hard work from club members. In the months following the ordeal, the booster club reorganized and voted to officially rename the group from the Ponder Band Booster Club to the Ponder Fine Arts Booster Club, making it inclusive of the district's choir program. Cely said the group has become more organized and has amended existing bylaws to focus more on financial protection procedures. Now, the club is thriving, she said. "We have over $20,000 in the bank right now," Cely said. "I feel it's fruitful. We have always been fruitful. It's just that somebody was taking it from us, and we didn't know how fruitful it was." Ponder ISD Superintendent Bruce Yeager said he feels the students in the district have moved on. "We are hopeful that this step in the process brings everyone nearer to closure," he said. "At Ponder ISD, our No. 1 priority is always the safety, well-being and academic advancement of our students. And we feel like our students have moved on and gleaned valuable life lessons from the situation." The high school band's director, Aaron Noland, declined to comment for this story Staff writer Britney Tabor contributed to this report. JULIAN GILL can be reached at 940-566-6882.

Sun, 03/19/2017 - 7:00am | Ben Zigterman CHAMPAIGN — Around 2012, Dean Hazen opened a gun shop out of his garage, converting it to a storefront and taking advantage of the surge in gun sales during the Obama administration. Once his business, called The Gun Experts, outgrew its location, Hazen had a decision to make. "Basically, it got to the point where I was in a residential area, and my business had grown to the point where I either had to go to a commercial spot or stop," said Hazen, a retired Urbana police officer. He decided he couldn't compete with online prices. "I took a very serious look at going to a commercial location, but then when I saw what was happening with the online world, it kind of scared me away," Hazen said. Instead, he became a licensed transfer agent and now works with the online retailers that made a commercial location impossible for him. When customers buy a gun online, they select a local transfer agent, such as The Gun Experts. The online retailer then ships the gun to Hazen, where the customer picks it up after they fill out a federal firearm transaction form and Hazen runs a check on their Firearm Owner's Identification card. As the transfer agent, Hazen charges $25 per gun he transfers, and said he transfers about 25 guns a week. "You can't compete" with the online retailers, Hazen said. "They don't even have a storefront. They don't have all that overhead." Customers can often save hundreds of dollars by shopping online, Hazen said. He recently looked up the prices of a Sig Sauer handgun. Online at Buds Gun Shop, it costs $893; at Gander Mountain, the same gun costs #1,299. Similarly, a Ruger rifle online at GrabAGun costs $1,500, while at Gander Mountain costs $1,899. Becoming a transfer agent for these online purchases "is what I needed to do to survive," Hazen said. "It was very tough to compete." While Gander Mountain and MC Sports sell much more than firearms, they faced some of the same pressures Hazen did. Both recently filed for bankruptcy, saying they struggled with direct-to-consumer sales and the rise of online shopping. Gander Mountain said it would be closing 32 of its underperforming stores, including the one in Champaign, and MC Sports is expected to close all its stores. With MC Sports and Gander Mountain leaving, Champaign-Urbana will be left with one large sporting goods retailer: the combination Dick's and Field & Stream at Market Place Mall. Unlike Gander Mountain and MC Sports, Dick's appears to be doing relatively well. It recently reported strong year-end results showing a year-to-year increase in net income and sales, solidifying its position as the largest U.S. sporting goods retailer (besides Walmart) and one of the few remaining with a national presence. The local market may not be big enough to support three sporting goods stores, but Champaign County Economic Development Corporation Executive Director Craig Rost said the two companies' struggles probably play a bigger role. "There probably are some shifts with people buying things online," he said. Hazen said he wasn't surprised that the retailers are closing their stores. "People go in there and look at it and feel it, then they go buy it online," he said. "It's just the way that the market works."

(Mark Mulville/Buffalo News) By Maki Becker Published Sat, Mar 18, 2017 SHARE TWEET EMAIL When Mustafa Abdo saw the lights of the fire trucks outside his apartment on Lafayette Avenue and then heard his neighbor banging on his door, screaming at him to get out, he scooped up his three young children and grabbed his car keys. That was all he and his family had left after the fire consumed the building early on the morning of March 11. "Everything is burnt," he said this weekend, as he got ready to check out a promising lead on a new apartment. The smell of fire still lingers at the scene of the March 11 fire on Lafayette Avenue. (Maki Becker/Buffalo News) Lourdes Pena never thought that when she smelled smoke that night and she, her husband, son and pet chihuahua evacuated the building they never would live there again. In the days since, her co-workers at the Jewish Community Center's Early Childhood Center where she works in infant care, along with the families of the children she cares for, have helped her family get back on their feet. Aisha Abdulle is heartbroken that the building that had become a welcoming home to her and so many others is gone, but she is thankful her husband and children escaped the fire while she was working her overnight nursing shift. A week after an arsonist set fire to the Lafayette-Barton Apartments on the West Side of Buffalo, destroying all 36 units, the nearly 90 people who all escaped without harm are picking up the pieces of their lives. A microcosm of the West Side, the residents came from around the world. Many are Somali-Americans. Some are Hispanic. There are a few African Americans, too. A couple of residents are originally from Nepal. A few senior citizens called it home, as did several families who sent their children to West Buffalo Charter School, just across the street. The apartments were spacious, well-kept and affordable, and many enjoyed the friendly, family-like atmosphere. Apartment fire leaves dozens displaced, $2 million in damages Now, the displaced tenants are scrambling to find new homes and replacing their clothes and household items. They also are being treated to the kindness and generosity of their community. Fire victim Mustafa Abdo sorts through some of the donated items for the roughly 80 victims of last weekends Lafayette Apartment fire at the Jerico Road Community Health Center in Buffalo Saturday, March 18, 2017. (Mark Mulville/Buffalo News) Event organizers Laila Ismail, left, and Juweria Dahir, right, sort through some of the donated clothes for the roughly 90 victims of last weekend's Lafayette Apartment fire at the Jericho Road Community Health Center in Buffalo Saturday, March 18, 2017. (Mark Mulville/Buffalo News) A fundraiser and donation drive was held Saturday to help the victims. At the Jericho Road Community Health Center on Barton Street, volunteers, many of them victims of the fire and their families, spent the day sorting through mounds of donated goods. Later in the afternoon, the victims were invited to pick out the items they need. A slew of speakers were invited, including Mayor Byron W. Brown and Common Council Member David Rivera along with the firefighters who responded to the blaze. The donation drive began when Laila Ismail, whose family members were displaced by the fire, set up a gofundme.com account last Sunday night to help all of the victims. Ismail lost her home in a fire in Buffalo about 15 years ago when she was 12. Her pet rabbit ate through wiring in the attic, sparking a fire. She and her sister escaped on their own but firefighters rescued their parents who were trapped on the second floor. She remembered how the community came together to help her family, and she wanted to do the same for these victims. "I know exactly what they're going through," she said. Within minutes of setting up the gofundme account, her friend Juweria Dahir, whose family also was routed by the Lafayette fire, contacted her, and the two began planning a donation drive. They set up a Google form to help them connect donors with volunteers willing to pick up and sort  items. By Saturday, they had more than 50 volunteers helping, and mountains of clothing, shoes, toys, toiletries, bedding and household goods to restock the victims' homes. HEAL International, West Side Community Services and Jericho Road all got involved to help. The community room at Jericho Road was filled with tables brimming with donations Saturday, as more people traveled from around the region to donate items. Jeanine Purcell of North Buffalo brought a carload of sweaters, jackets, belts and household items to give away. "You need to feel each other's struggles and pain," she said, unloading her orange Subaru. Tom Morse of Lancaster (left), his wife Ruth (center) and Sister Charlene Fontane drop off donations for the Lafayette fire fundraiser. (Maki Becker/Buffalo News) Tom and Ruth Morse of Lancaster got a little lost on the West Side trying to get to Jericho Road with their donations. They ran into Sister Charlene Fontana, who also was bringing some clothes, and they found the Barton Street location together. "We read about the fire in the paper," Tom Morse said, "and we wanted to bring stuff for the people." Offering a prayer at Saturday's interfaith event was Imam Yahiye Omar of the Buffalo Islamic Community Center. His daughter was displaced by the fire. He remarked on how the fire brought together so many people. "This kind of tragedy has united us," he said before the event. "They are Christians, Muslims. This is solidarity. This shows us we are united." Monetary donations still are being accepted through gofundme and at M&T Bank branches via HEAL International/ Lafayette fire fund. Mariam Bakari gazed out at the tables and tables of items that strangers from all around Buffalo donated. "Seeing this much support, it keeps us moving," she said. Mariam Bakari was doing an online exam when the fire broke out on March 11. (Maki Becker/Buffalo News) Bakari recounted how she was doing an online exam the night of the fire when she smelled smoke. She opened the door to the hall and saw smoke coming from the laundry room. She called 911 and grabbed her two children. Her family has been staying with in-laws as they try to figure out what their next step is. After watching the firefighters battle the fierce flames that tore through the building and seeing the burned wreckage, now covered in ice and still smelling of smoke, the former residents marvel that no one was hurt. Firefighters were at the scene for more than 12 hours, and the damage to the building and contents was estimated at $2.5 million. Abdulle can't help but think about what it would have been like to drive home from her shift at Erie County Medical Center that morning to find that her husband, Abdifatah Osman, her 2-year-0ld daughter, Maisara, and infant son Sufian, had been hurt or worse. "Thank God for that, looking at the damage, that everyone came out of it as quick as they did," she said. "That right there – that's amazing." Immediately after the fire, it was believed there was just one casualty – a pet parrot. It was Pena's. She had left Elmer behind in its cage in the apartment kitchen, thinking they would all be back in a few hours. Elmer was a gift from a friend at the JCC who passed away. She was at a Red Cross shelter at St. John's- Grace Episcopal Church on Bidwell Parkway when she learned the bird had survived. A worker who was clearing out debris heard a noise from her apartment and found the bird. He tucked it into his coat and kept working another four hours before bringing it out. "I was very happy," Pena said. Many, but not all the apartment residents, were allowed to go back into the building for a few minutes while accompanied by firefighters to try to collect some items. Pena said she had seven minutes in her apartment. There wasn't much she could salvage. "We lost almost everything," she said. Abdulle had about 10 minutes in her apartment, and she was happy to find her wedding photos, flash drives of her children's baby pictures along with more keepsake photos that she had stored in plastic bags. Everything in the unit was soaking wet. "And it reeked of smoke," she said. But all the support she has gotten over the last week made her grateful for what she does have. "When something like this happens, you're heartbroken. You're in pieces," she said. "You just need someone to say: It's going to be OK. Its' going to get better. That's what the community has done. Through prayers. Through donations." Abdo feels as though he finally is coming out of shock. He had taken the week off from his computer and cellphone repair business and had spent the time trying to find a new home for his family. "Everything. Everything in that apartment," he said. The Red Cross gave him $625 in emergency aid for his family and he immediately went to Walmart where he bought clothes, coats and boots for his 5-year-twins and 3-year-old son. "I had to get them all their uniforms for school," he said. The twins, Mohamoud and Zahra, attend West Buffalo Charter. His wife, Fatima Sharif, is an assistant teacher there. Abdo finally found just the right place for his family Saturday morning. He showed a photo of the yellow house on West Avenue that he decided to rent. Mustafo Abdo shows a photo of the house he just rented for his family Saturday after they were displaced by the fire. (Maki Becker/Buffalo News) "I didn't want to be in an apartment anymore," he said. His kids, who asked all week what had happened to their apartment, were thrilled, he said. They have never lived in a house before. Abdo was among the volunteers helping out throughout the week, picking up donations. Some people told him that he had enough to worry about, that there was no need for him to volunteer. "I said: No, no, no. I have to be involved," he said. As the last of the donors brought in their goods to the Saturday fundraiser and the final touches were being made for the event later that afternoon, he nodded in approval. "Beautiful," he said. "This is awesome."   Click here to see the comments. Add yours now!

Tomase defends his stance on Pete Abe and his tweets. You Might Like Transcript - Not for consumer use. Robot overlords only. Will not be accurate. He's training and tomorrow losing one's Sports Radio W yeah. Because never again John's a mossy break down everything would compacts the Bruins into all new England sports so it's too. My seat on Sports Radio WEEI. We can't possibly be racist because we root for the blacks. You know I'm. I don't care we have that token lights I don't care about I'll root for black player that doesn't really prove anything it's I don't wanna. I want to take this too far but there are probably people who own slaves who felt though that was my favorite back guy worked the hardest well last topic I don't I don't like that language this idea that. I rooted for Pedro I'm not racist like OK let's let's not let's. Let's ease off on now. I can. Now is Mike tolley giants rusty is big smile on his days ago I narrowed what you're at the slain you know what I regret about that yeah when nothing. Not nothing. Not even a slave part and no I I I believe that sorry Nadia I Zaria morning guys like LA I'm I'm the you want my honest opinion that particular defense. I'm not real IDO. I cheered for poppy I cheered for I watched Bill Russell played basketball like that's not a good that's a sign that's not a defense. I agree to a 100% beat and that particular point because I am I currently reading a book. That has to do I forgot the actual title list. But the sub title is. Race in America from Boston Debra plans that focuses on the East Coast in the north particularly in the fifties and sixties. And one whole chapter is dedicated to when Jackie Robinson. You know played in Brooklyn and people came out white people black people came out they love Jackie Robinson they cheer for him but when him and his wife Rachel tried to move their family to Connecticut. Lo and behold. They could not get a house in Connecticut because while they love cheering for Jackie Robinson and they did one of living in their task now some sailor that was a totally different Arafat is the 191960s. It does exist anymore. I beg to differ I don't think that because you can root for a player. You know of about not whites ethnicity that subtly your not a racist person. And I'm not saying everyone who says that feels I do I know that dip your toe into the lakes Avery poll that's one thing you know it was hers on point of view. You start to get things started to crawl like a crusher that I mean whatever you want me to not say when I feel. I want you say you fail vehement announcing hi. Now that is a simple first timer like slightly disagree I know that's cadets that they that they want more today you know he's right now Richard pry backtracked and recap where this all came for a finally joining China conversation. No yelling no screaming and name calling. That 6177. And he finds out and Agnes earnings and same thing at 779790. Three's avid. I just mostly in I was wearing Adam is an inspiring. Pete Abraham. Beat writer for the Boston Globe. We did something outs. Actually it was 88 there's actually a CBS sports sheets. About David Price sister status sister station. You know we are all part of one big family now I am. And someone hacked weeded. Had replied to the tweets. And including Pete Avon it. Saying IA never base my never wanted David Price anywhere I don't like David Price. And Pete Abraham chose then to respond I think it was even less than ours is better off without an off about them. And Pete Abraham responded when I've. Okay grand wizard. Which is that escalated pretty quickly so for those of you may not familiar with the grand wizards context that of course they had the kkk. I'd be honest I what I am when I heard the flak so you had texted me. And sagging have spent the last couple ours defending PGA classic that's why not why we need to defend heated what's going on would indeed wanted to do this time. At an actress about well I mean come on how bad can it be doable things out of proportion of the writers all the time. And I saw the exchange I was like. War low low low low low. I Amy I talked about while back he not know yet 0400. That came out of nowhere. I just understands. In such a highly did spice of time already. Why we would feed. In an act like I don't I don't know what. I know Pete Abraham I'm gonna pull up right now I know that he did apologize. And put out sort of attack on a notes. Again so the screen grabbed it and pointed out. An apology and explanation for his actions. I still don't know that it's not so eight's figure response was brag your friend John emailed me and I now realize I missed a cue for somebody else would set some vile things to me. He knows the story it was a stupid to read I did not intend to directed that you my sincere apologies and I hope you enjoyed the season. Is pleaded apology. I hope that's enough for me. Because it's not aiming. I don't each of which read down. But I don't you feel like maybe he should say let's see you everybody to. All readers listen I really went overboard on mess and I need to be more careful a new vehicle we hold athletes to a high standard we hold broadcasters too high standards. Pounding beat writers should be. Kept out about a big beat writer should be protected from I mean you still are a public figure and what you say it was. Really need. Should need to call someone are racists. Without any action proof that their racist is really dangerous because like we've had a conversation before that diminishes actual races. Yes I mean listen. I'm gonna steal a line from your but he Tom currently. This is a pebble and an army knew that as the pebble in your shoot them like I I couldn't really get too worked up because here's the thing is if you. If you scroll through. Fire back at fans who say seemingly innocuous things frequently so this is not news may be. Grand wizard part is taken it to another level which now bottling everything he posts had this summer pianists a lot of my best on the waterworks. I don't think. I don't I don't think the people who are going after he gave. Untoward or an hour particularly righteous I mean c'mon this is piling on. And and to be totally frank Blake it. Pete and I are not particularly close I don't think he cares for me and also I sort of laughed throwing error obviously Tomas he's just stick it up for his buddy. Wouldn't say we're buddies would not say where Biden I can I buy her by. For you not me but you have to put yourself in my shoes when I lock in that night with Mott unaware that this thing has gone nine. And he reads me comment and it's like reaction unlike I don't know like I haven't talked to heat. I have no idea of the context I have no idea between was deleted I had no idea the miss read something I have no idea as he says and I don't know I'd buy this buy. Taken at face value for now. Oh I confused you with someone else who's been a pain in whatever so maybe there's an act but no it's like you know you there is there's only one that. Appropriate response to that in it is to tee off. Without knowing anything and siren not gonna do that. I will say that that idea that you just completely slam colleagues just to slam them I'm not important in the wee Ellis I'm not bored. Am not now I don't it's China that's your Boller that's five at bats that you want to do by. Again it. No I actually heard the sound the next Danaher to the next day on the morning show. I was at what happened I didn't even seen a lot I'd go back that I had to try and find it tweets because they'd been deleted but of course people screen grab that. I do remember thinking how that is. How is that harsh that is harsh left turn. For aid otherwise innocuous comment and I guess the reason eight. It troubled me a little bit more is because this isn't the first time I've seen hands Pete Abraham sort of take. Something a little too far a lot of contacts and act speaking specifically of Michael Floyd signing when the video came out. Him being arrested. PDA posted the video and an attached to it. This is why things escalate this is why some do it again I'm paraphrasing that sending to the effect of this is why we have problems that the police this is steak they escalated the situation. And I concepts like he actually I I give to the police officers in Arizona and in the Phoenix PD yet a lot of credit I think they handled it with. Every bit of urgency restraint that they needed to handle it and that situation and you were dealing with someone who was absolutely need created and there are other lives at stake. Because he takes his foot off the break. Is it hasn't had his car parking goes slamming through an intersection and somebody can get really hurt like I don't feel that that was it. I don't like and I liked that videos like Al man goes way police officers weren't fair Michael Floyd because he was black guys I think that's why when I repeated comment I was like. What's going on here. I didn't wanna take to slam him but I did start to think what is going on beneath the surface like why this need to. Take things and make them about race when they clearly are it's. Which I think again I go back to you and I think it's big recalls I don't think anyone should stick to sports I think that's stupid I think if you're passionate about something and you see an injustice against another person. I think you should stand up for a person. But I think it Desi huge disservice. And I think it hurts. They're cries when it's like anything that you see is racist and anything you do is call people out is racist because that's a really. That's a really hard charge against. Yet and the Lily followed a grand wizard death and then yeah as I said David. Yet but I think this is to get on grass has doubled this is help our and I used to toys are anti this is 88 spoilers are no spoilers. I'll dot com or generational and as people who are introduced to those books every year. But everything is not as it seems you know it's a dollar anyway. Or attack on our way out racism so. Mr. Mike my problem is this is all sort of like part and parcel with the current climate. And the political climate. In this is something that those of us on the left and I am I will put myself front and center have been guilty of particularly as the election was gearing up and we are all it despondent and beside ourselves that trump was still. I figure we kept saying anyone who votes for him as a racist anyone who votes for him is a racist and you just start. And I'm calling myself out on this guilty set and a lot. And the problem is there are shades of gray it is not like that. But win new. That is sort of the base level of discourse now. You leak it leads to things like this people are just too quick to start throwing those terms around in those terms. Should be reserved for when they are really merited this clearly wasn't one of those cases. Yeah I just think that you know I think. Many of us have particularly those of us in the media do you have somewhat of a responsibility to take a deep breath and I know that it's hard I I you know I we all get attacked on social media we all get attacked on the air fire colleagues. And so I you know it's it's a big natural to get into a defensive mode about it. But I think that it's in there is a larger responsibility on people who write talked. Are on television for a living too. Maybe not wade and to the murky parts of the water. Yes and you know when they go low we Ohio I get again this is so out of left field poll based on turn out that I just was so surprised you know what I have a problem with though also like cool why do we care. Why are we breathing through. Pete Abraham's mentions bias CBS sports to find some yes are you know what I mean it will be once daily somebody's side some on screen grab not all I understand that but what I'm saying is. It'd be one thing if on his primary Twitter account he was like you know reach we'd sit and write all this guy's a grand wizard. But we're picking through responses. To tweets that we never would have even seen it. It's just that the way that it was presented it wasn't written in a story it was and we did from his main account to everyone. It was a dumb response to one person it's like a week is that overdue and now. We're gonna go and read through every ones are out on everybody why do every pass and I mean unfortunately and I don't think that most people like that I can't get too worked up about this and like he did something dumb. To it's he sent it to one person. I mean I you know I guess that people want him to lose his job five but she's like. Pack well I'd I'd I think this this idea of hashing everything out effort Twitter and raking people over the coals. For. A missed a week. Hayes. That's right to defend peed yeah like it's our hold gotcha kind of thing everything is a gotcha moment that we can all LOL about. And it's a solar and what do parents do not do not call in or tweeting me and soon you go listen though the Donald Trump and cyber when you are the president of the United States and you put it on your actual Twitter account. That is different you your health doing different standard if you write sports writer at the globe or the presidents are the leader of the free world debt and by the way everything like trump is doing things very publicly I think it's different than liked trolling. As our trawling and he'd be not trolling but trawling. Through the Twitter mentions a but he to see how he's interacting with people I don't care this this is not new I mean this is how this is how Pete has always chosen. To get in that sense PS IC yeah. Witness witnesses with his army clearly so that went to fire you know and I said that so what do. The screener I don't call screeners it's like there's like. We got some very different brands and Gary different things from try to get so mall although first the first pick all the scans for New Hampshire not so that I can answer what's it pats do that left tackle will. Well it won't exactly matter like a resurgent and come back to the 1230 are are you here is Alex Jon and Gardner job hunt under the show. Good afternoon folks thank you pay unless I totally sucked respectfully a minute a minute and a half. I'm not on Twitter nor any of the rest of the social media is good for you get a I want you damn kids but. We appreciate that. Contractually. I'm out of a little bit obviously but a but first what I don't want any chance at the fellow that was on the other kind of they've since tweet and tweet back thank you for the apology and much more on gospels and chancellor right. Thought on that session that was a mustache and I don't know I know he's been on curtain Cali and I think he's going to be in Monday with. Dale hall of speaker Kurt Kelly and it on the federal level kind of guy am unfortunately I'm a bit of a political nerd in. Whatever I and about a where I'm horrified that Donald. The difference other states I guess is insistence on. In the in the left right world can provide broad strokes broad brush. This is one of those issues it seems like some far more on the left want to portray a lot of stuff in it the racial terms. And some on the right lights faded. Three white middle aged guys 1 o'clock in a fashion that may be. Implies that racism is noble and that this is a done deal many but it would even hand. An issue of race for another two on taxes is shift you know full. Q and you made a point I mean because we hero worship athletes of any you know strike or manner that doesn't mean Jack in in the big school put things but this is just one little vision I work in the prisons that Bolivia. That's affected some of my viewpoint on things but. I'm one who think that some folks on the left should be most of you know there's a lot of U2 lead the discussion of how we got to this place. OK but there's a lot of problems in the black community that need to be healed in the black community in my opinion. And people on the right. You know know not everybody bit that was against Obama is racist of course not fumble Lamar I don't know the percentage. But it's just the all or nothing thing we just the left and the right again wanted to throw activity each other I don't know where it gets. I'm deputies are polarized times it's unfortunate out which I think is wide maybe this. Again this reply this one treats it as one person has need blown up larger than it normally would because it feels like it is. It's adding fuel to an already out of control fire. You guys filled in the context for me how I was saying in my without having read it that one that equity and told him there was no hint as far as I could tell anything. Around race but you guys filled in the thing that he. It was some spoken to somebody else than the other attract. He says he and I mean yeah I guess you can choose. Where do you believe that. I don't know but that's that's his that's what. Hope he's honest both but anyway I just take you know a left right issue again and while wonderful actor Ted each other not listen in yell and you know. Thanks for what you spoke about that. Now you present and stunt. So I will say we got notes from and Tweeter ironically enough some of Twitter message me to say bats. The guy that Pete called racists has made his account for ten I just I went just went to it and and fortunately. We can't see if he apologize yes I mean I and frankly I don't blame that guy he didn't ask to be dragged in the middle of this you know. All he did was act like a fan and say something that a fan what's day and the next thing you know he's a grand wizard so. Yeah I and I understand B there's no defending. You know what he wrote that. Now apparently and now we'll take a quick break your look and getting some treats her a couple of people that are saying this is not an isolated incident with him that he that PD default status sometimes so that is an exploration as well I mean act is. You know I know that our. Our companies try to let us be as open an anonymous an authentic as we possibly can when in her acting on social media interacting with commoners come enters and emailers. But there is also should be a a level of. Don't you know not to Barack Obama is on but it. Don't you don't have to go low Nagle and you can go high and Angola or you know you can do just not respond to go anywhere at all that's stop us some classy approach. Irene take a quick break and go back to your phone calls or write activists 617779793. Cent a. You're locked into training because generic and John Tomas talking perhaps reason more on Sports Radio WEEI. The in our society. A black man can be arrested for almost anything. He's probably. Sporting event. And saw some people pushing each other and he intervened. I wouldn't wanna go to jail for it. Saw the offense. Michael Scott on race relations. Let's show and says. Miss it miss Michael Scott to make you say yeah once he led lighting in Australia. Light and heavy situation. I should be pointed out by the way event as B. You know some do you play out wanna give you big Q tip I Ares status and they say not to clean ears but I think proselytize listeners you take a big Q tip clean out your ears. It out and about lack sensitive properly here. Out it's not an hour before where it is not a onetime incidents of bumpy Abraham. Negatively engaging with fans and taking personally. Slights against members of the rights acts. I honestly I feel like the bigger issue is not the grand wizard thing it's the wire you constantly jumping in to lie in wire to wire you David Price. Why do you care why do you care inquire you David Price. Who has to constantly interacting constantly not only that but it's not our job to stick up for these guys that's that's my point I mean I'll tell you. My favorite Red Sox though Ortiz of human spirit guided deal with all time. But my favorite person that I have covered in there in terms of I'd like this guy he's a great guy. J. D. Drew. J. D. Drew not very popular among Red Sox fans I understand that. And if you go back through the clips you'll see plenty of stories are I wrote about J. D. Drew and not being healthy wise and J. D. Drew in the line up blah blah blah I like the guy but that it wasn't my job to tell people what a great guy J. D. Drew once he retired. It's time now but. Love Jay Egypt Ager is a great guy passed and got. Its popular line. It's well played match will play gaffe it's not I mean when I was in Milwaukee John apps for it was like my theater guy I mean we can actually have real conversations. Com I knew him and his wife Carrie while highlights the whole family. But when John asked for started to sink I had no choice but to say John experts started distinct and and you cannot you have to their house to be this is why as a female. I I always say I hate that's my heat when reporters dates players are when they used locker rooms as their personal Matt stack cop. It is not a place you cannot have you can be friendly with someone and still have objectivity like I objective news about my friends of my friends do something stupid I might. Girl how stupid you in lake my sleeve comment I. And it might say Tom yeah I thought I thought that maybe steps every doesn't get any doesn't he went there UN UN chains and whips it slaves and stuff. Precedent was pretty. I was for an appointment. You can do that when your friends this summer when you are romantically and all there was someone that becomes much more difficult because there's a whole another level of emotion and feeling an attachment to someone. Sent him back serve went off the track their little bad that. It's not our job it's not a it's not hard times get our job to defend these guys on our job to date these guys it's not our job to be you know to invite them for a birthday parties like we are supposed to cover them. And and Dino. Cultivate relationships so that they can become sources for us we can go to them as we need something we have that sort of connection to the team and that connection to the team is not supposed to be. Hey my daughter's getting baptized on Sunday we'd like to invite you in your life over. Not our job in and it's definitely not our job to be on social media saying you know it's just not my job to slam or defend other reports. He had it's yet I mean I understand the the environment at WBI's probably a little different than other places and that we are more than willing and we in fact encouraged. It makes for good gradient in any good don't show goes after another show. It's compelling and listen to it I can tell you how many times I've downloaded Fauria fights with somebody or Kirk goes after this person. Holly does you know so I understand I understand it works for us. But I think we sometimes lose sight of the fact that the real world doesn't always work that way and so I know that. Kirk and those guys want me to blast off on Pete Abraham. And part of me says what I told you it's a pebble in your shoot not mine and I am not. I'm not to the ad is fired up about I'm not as required by this is everybody else I think what he said is stupid I'll leave it at that. But there's also a recognition on my part that I work with these guys every day and even. If Pete and I aren't currently fans of each other. There's hills Doris pack yeah he back I worked his ass off I will say that he works more than anyone he makes every road trip what ever. There is still a work place environment to consider and I'm sorry if I'm not gonna just blast off on one of my colleagues when I'm frankly not that moved by what had. Let's go to the phones shot and Watertown. Media's lack of objectivity what you mean this is gonna player out and. We have you guys say yeah don't write it to and are on hold about. Yes first I want it to eight John. I think. A lot of radio hosts have misconstrued. The week you're trying to make. As they were bashing used to kill you or wait so. Want your example meat eat. A little extreme content. I hate hate gates you port so. Are that I must say that thing. But yes I am concerned where are on the scene to be this growing. What our outlook activity. Amongst the media. But he knows the beat writers so to speak. Covering the specific team. We paired several incidents. Over the past couple years. That sector were pertinent question and the type of reporting work. Kind of treatment. I don't world human. But. For our in my line right right. I work social worker. Marquette number that clients who you are very attractive for a period of very clear ethical line. Professionally. Com bet you don't Crocs. Or you'll never work. And about parity. I guess in sect in what what you guys were part of that I can irritate the problem is for an expert Peter Abraham to respond. So intensely. And so quickly. To comment about a player is it concerning to me it's. I think that's fair and an app that's a fair take I mean honestly all of these people who are saying that. John Sullivan the globe sports editor needs to do this and that. The only thing I would say to he is Ari you know don't states there are lots idiots on Twitter just ignore them by. My bigger thing would be why exactly did you feel the need to jump in there and defend its player and that's what wreck that. That's the bigger issue to me I don't you know. People have to understand we are human and you get a whole lot of vitriol on Twitter and I know that particular line was not anything. I'd be on the pale. And whatever you know wet heat's off from that particular Tweeter but. In general you see a lot of nasty stuff day after day after today and as a human it does Wear you down a little bit so that's why I guess I am slightly sympathetic to his idea of well I've heard this stuff from this I mistook you for another guy because there is a lot of nastiness there. And anyone who says. I just ignored it doesn't mean anything yeah I mean you eventually learn how to do that but it's not his easiest it's as someday some days he's just an art and I acts act. I can't tell you how many times I've started to respond to some my power. Base specs but expects expects base you know I. I would say it like you know it's yes send our social media rules are pretty relaxed obviously tweet political things they don't have a problem with it but the one. Emphasis that is always made is be very careful when engaging people because it's a slippery slope. And when somebody insults you in and you insult and it can't. It can't get degrading pretty fast and I'm I'm I'm. Guilty of it which is why you know I've taken the steps of just not in her acting as often with people anymore try to slip on an in her act and go back and forth of people but. It's a point where like. I know myself well enough that I wanted to defend myself so maybe it's just better Bridgestone to editing at all because I don't want and up without a job because they said something stupid twit which is what you're okay now. You say something stupid to an tag. And there's no repercussions for them all the repercussions around. It just as sour is just doesn't make sense but I I I do think it's enters image chone brings up the fact that. Because again this is this is media as a whole right like there's this this lack of trust there's this huge distrust of media in general particularly on the new side that now it feels a little bit like. Instances like this starts making even did not trust the people that are covering your local sports seems like. What you're telling me we I would say we even see like an out of shock there. He's the patriots pocket. Yes which I've tried to argue time and time again Adam sectors not reporting things like Jimmy geez not definitely not going to be traded. Unless he were positive that he's really not he's not gonna let himself. Let's just ruined yeah are a lot who's exactly. Yes but there seems to be but I guess is I mean. The responsibility falls on us writes you. He hold ourselves to an Adams after. Tight standard not to go back and forth not to get caught and just being mouthpiece for the teams that we cover the players that we cover. And suffer the possible repercussions in the locker room I mean it's it is possible by the way do you say something you don't defend a player. And they and trust me they look at everything when they tell you I don't read too big to be the only person chiefly reads nothing is for sale yet. Everybody else who thinks sees things you have to have enough guts to. It's standard route it's gas and rock conceit. I'm Brian can read just like symbols he just knows numbers you know numbers six and nine. Boat media and the line in May or may not cross this is interesting to me Stephens Fall River. Why I'm well thanks I'm curious what this is about. And their role green you know he's cute he could swearing in the last I call like that so. Steve you're honest you're at least it gets your point it rates you point what's our line quite he would. Heard back in the gate agent. Was red sock that Matt Ara. That crash and it had a big all of these guys we all apple. And they they. Make quicker the worse. It. Maybe balanced child. Today a big interest thought all would have I don't know what. I don't Dalton will. That we would look back at the opening of the center fielder came from the bad. Show. But it could hit it in the bets that the that it. Suddenly dying and about a latest bossy center there's an edited an umpire. Oh Carl Everett her lover and. Carlin had Brooklyn uncle however it here. And I'm watching it there's. Credit. And won it yet and that's a lack after all what are you can. Excite me. Had no that was all point lead would you add it up probably walked right less of Allah. Right for the globe yeah I'm undeclared. It's it's probably Dennis Shaughnessy I am where we dancer and I am you know Steve instant ramble a bit I mean to listen I don't. I did actually disagree with the notion that reporters are closer to players now. Back in the seventies I mean it's well known Peter Gammons had a locker in the Red Sox clubhouse he used to shag fly balls. The writers used to fly with the team on the planes so you know all these guys now it's very corporate ties to like you know this as well as anyone. You'd go in there and yeah there's access. I actually rehab early on that airport Asians GAAP and but actually really getting to know guys having guys trust you. In this age of social media in this age of everyone's trying to build their own brand players and media. The ability to. Just have and sort of off the record. BS shooting session with a player it's not like he used to be act I scene changed even since I started. Well I mean I seem to change since I sort of covering baseball in nearly 2000 instant you know now you know decade and a half later. You no longer ice this you can stand and lean up against a railing and talk to a manager for two point when he fragments just two of you now the minute you walk up to somebody start having a conversation with them. It's like ever inserts lingering he's ever rice so afraid of missing something. And then getting screamed about it at back at their television station or their newspaper or their radio station. So there's just no you don't have that seeing you try to get a wanna want want with a guy now. It's like impossible the next thing you know cameras just hovering and we eating there and just like. Like flies on who hot day and it it's it's it's awful at least your cameras though that's knowing I get it I mean some of the cameras that way it was an unasked there. Critics so excited to be deck its three G-8. Oh. Being. This isn't yet ready to go ahead and got real knack first spring Jane. Brain again. Each other know they love it. So annoyed me snow and light. This is inside journalism no I don't care about the state very quickly you were down there were three straight days or Brian McPherson who covers the Sox for the Perugia. He had late one on one interviews of the most random guys Tyler Thornburg. Was whining thinks why hire might have been one before your whole thing when them. And all three times these random nondescript players he asked one question. You think it's one on one Al sudden. Every camera in the clubhouse. Is around these second tier players while the organized trying to ask questions about that I would like honor I would like and say listen guys I'm doing this one on one he can happen when an odds on that you do outside the argument is immune. Tyler Yates would be now on the ice packs stick to the three. It's no he'd rather and I'm a brewers and I'd rather play toiling away on a lot you're out there and Alina. It's like eight games who's who's who which it's just boom Joseph TV guide puts not TD boys when he gets asked exchange. It's so annoying and I am a television person nineteenth in TV. But I also cut I teach them new side. And so I was raised. In the industry a little more of the aggressive news gathering and I just some of the covers baseball the time. I just don't it's that hard asking good questions these stupid like sound ready and food treats me that it's feature heat warmth and I'm sure the fans armor clamoring to hear that. Talking again to Anchorage and angered Chinese Alley or take a broad included back to your calls six and 777979. Reveal your chance to talk all new England sports would treading into mossy. Plus Sports Radio WEEI. I'd like to invite them and us to do through the day Brad he might take months. That program relieved not yeah I figured that credit only orders alone to Hitler. Or a depending what is that they have what's been the fourth all white rights but a just this weekend that we will track down getting our equipment had a Monday and is organized mourn every month bring Britain to the station that's what I am 1000. I do like how Lima. So I have a scenic Internet superstars I've heard. Yeah Adam softball umpires in for a guy to make his Twitter account private. President body. Brad Brad welcome body movement I'm Bonnie there was this will help him keep up his anonymity by calling them Bobby Unser Brad. I over we're gonna takes your calls on this topic in camera movement now will move back about the Butler also going to talk to. Kevin O'Connor from the ringer who is the best young. Basketball reporter in the country am convinced he's a Boston kid he's awesome and he writes awesome stuff and European states are gone on in the Celtics having potentially number one overall pick. He wrote he really fascinating story of Alonzo ball these the only point guard. Who has one of the ugly shots at kerosene and yet he shoots. Over forward on threes now so we wanna see if if that Katrina was sabotage attempt. I would say 2 o'clock hour like red top of the hour tumor blocks RA let's go out back to finds Greg in New Hampshire about the show. Craig. Painting me as tenacious news Chinese. Yeah phone use my own doing. But I go to Kurdistan you know what kind the SX. Apparently the mood are right here is JT get the last word and PDA billions of mass C and stuff. Oh victory tribute that was the sections where there are under your. Mean how whenever I'm on the radio to look at John I don't want either or yell I'm not a reality. Bow your frequent caller we like yelling yeah. Why isn't it relevant. That the most popular players on writ large. And are unknown attachments on Pedro veterinarians. Ortiz I think the most popular player right now on the red boxes. Our monkey. I think. You might be required check he currently on her favorite players. And we don't say a turtle because Roger Clemens welcome popular Jon Lester wasn't that. Our unless there was popular and Clemens is but and you tell you listen if you wanna say. I'm just gonna argue I'm not arguing anything race related all of gonna say is do you think Clemens was more or less popular than Manny is Manny had his detractors asylum. He's an idiot but they're not many saw more. Sure many rent art and history I guarantee or a daughter love dimensions. You know ten years lol I love on. And fans got on Ortiz all the time rising whining about his contract so I mean yes these guys are popular because they're greatly outweigh Barnes should keep count is absolutely hammered they loved weighed by. Box no I looked when I grew up watching the Red Sox I loved weighed by. Allegra parts of triple and pension rights but you know we had Bard's. Not a our group fired arm. J. D. Drew not a popular player I just I know I'd. I just wonder why I say that are relevant. I'm saying that that's a crutch it's a crutch that a lot of people use when we're talking about the race thing and and it's the implication it's the implication because. Hey I root for these guys therefore. Bears and we know there are no races here. You know I I root for these guys you can't because you feel someway about a player. Does not mean that everybody else does and does not mean that these issues that some of these players experience. Now that Wal-Mart aren't the memo of pop or you pay almost all. In embarked in all of warrant when it comes to root for the Celtics patriots. I mean are overweight but I just yeah. I am a big Janet and I do I I do again in this book that I that I have been reading has been really fascinating and it really fascinating look breeze relations in the Indy northeast which has long been seen as a far more progressive part of the country than anywhere else. The but it's just. I would just say just speak highs you root for someone or you can you don't. Looking negative really up high and someone in a position of power in six ass who is either black. Hispanic. Asian Mary Kane bush slum does it mean I guess would be either real true bar and a measuring stick of what you really feel on the inside is how do you treat the person that you run into at the grocery store or the person you bump into on the subway. I that's where I say you just because you root for someone who is excellent in a sport for a team you root for what you're really ridding forest Epperson did you wealth for your team. Not necessarily for the community as a whole. Industrial Omar. Back in the Celtics were quite worried about Larry Bird there. A large large percentage. After mayor and embarked in wake of sorts. Because their book. I mean. That's well tomorrow. The lakers were also really really good at the time. I hear you saying that out of black people are racist black people are racist. And it. I'm I'm gonna go with what attorney talked about earlier and you mentioned Jackie Robinson people rooted for Jackie Robinson they didn't necessarily want to live and in their neighborhood and I think to say that. I grew up on these guys how long ago I mean that's OK I don't at all I'm a nice I I've I respectfully disagree that that sort of segregation is ancient history. Yes and in deep brown I mean okay so we'll go to the eighties. Or ninety's or in a late eighties early ninety's Steve Brown gets pulled over by the Wellesley cops who probably rooted forum as a Celtic but. Didn't know who he was at the time I mean did so this idea that because you root. For a player means that there's no racism but now that's. Sorry that's not how listen I have a friend who am I you know this is a private conversations I'm not an eight username but they are in the media. There they are black their husband is black and a big part of why they moved onto another marketplace because of who those. The races and they often felt here they would go to a bar and they would get help for a long time and we give them their bill right away. Maybe get into a taxi and people lag if they did a driver wade to treat them differently edges that avenue in Dorchester. Starter mat rat I mean there's just horrible when asked they live orgy that in Dorchester. They did not find a way to into the city and and you know. This idea that this is all disappeared and I'm not saying it's rampant. Or that it's an indictment on every single person who has whites can't are out there are Barack races on both sides are bad people in every ethnic group. Expected to completely try to deny that this still exists is part of the problem. Yeah and this is I mean I'm gonna sound like such lefty in there and a quote this in the morning and whatever whenever there's a very John does a very white point of view like. I feel this way there for our. Everybody everyone feels this way and this other person's experience while he can't it can't possibly be this is how I feel like. My individual love of something changes someone else's place in. In in the universe like that's not how works. It's not at that that something's where you know we talked about the soft fair Kurt I can mauled the writer for Newsweek. Wouldn't have been hospitalized for a seizure because someone who hates Jewish people's sentiment strobe light knowing that it could possibly get knowing it was apple and out of here is epileptic so odds it's it's again. They might it concentrated small amount of people I think it's probably bigger than most of us feel that may be also smaller than. And others feel but there is still systemic racism. In our society and to pretend that it doesn't exist to pretend that. Keating's comments came out of nowhere or that it's possible that you could root for Jackie Bradley junior but not want a black family to move into you I think that's I just think that's a dinner yet apart and that's what I was getting out with the comment that. Our including we have gone over the clock I as far as I have gotten a read little bit about the format he's gonna now. I'll look back to footballer gonna go back to talking about the Boller I also Paul McCartney hang on. And diet earlier comment is about things Serbian patient or gonna go to you we come back and turn intimacy.

Tim Dominick tdominick@thestate.com i Cindi Ross Scoppe Associate Editor LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Columbia, SC TWO EXTRAORDINARY things happened in the House the other day: Representatives rejected an opportunity to take a slap at the environment, and even more surprisingly, they rejected an opportunity to take yet another slap at local governments. The vehicle they chose not to board for both trips was H. 3529, which would have banned cities and counties from banning plastic bags, which coastal communities are doing because of the devastating damage the bags can do to sea creatures that swallow them. If you haven’t seen any pictures, you should. Or maybe you shouldn’t; it’s pretty gruesome. __________ Effort to prevent plastic bag bans crashes in Legislature This business-friendly bill is friendly to some businesses — but not most SC towns, counties and schools to pay for shoring up pensions __________ For cities and counties, this was a significant win — which is defined in the State House as the absence of a loss. And it came just one week after House Labor, Commerce and Industry Chairman Bill Sandifer was forced to at least temporarily back away from his business license bill that, among other things, would force cities and counties to give 25 percent discounts to out-of-state businesses. Seriously. But that doesn’t mean the environment has turned friendly for local governments. Rep. Cezar McKnight summed up the general attitude with a tongue-in-cheek amendment to the plastic bag bill. “Notwithstanding another provision of law,” he proposed to write into state law, “no county, municipality, or other local government may enact any ordinance, regulation, or other law.” About anything. Thank goodness the amendment was ruled out of order. It might have passed. Here’s one thing that is clearly not legitimate: ordering cities and counties to perform services for the state, but refusing to pay for that work. You can sometimes make a legitimate case for insisting on a statewide policy instead of letting cities and counties create a patchwork of contradictory laws. We wouldn’t let them write their own open-records laws or ethics laws, for instance; those do need to be one-size-fits-all, or at least adhere to a minimum statewide standard. The legitimacy of other one-size mandates can be less clear. But here’s one thing that is clearly not legitimate: ordering cities and counties to perform services for the state, but refusing to pay for that work. The standard word for people who do that sort of thing is deadbeat. It’s bad enough to short state agencies. Recall when the Legislature kept forcing the Corrections Department to lock up more prisoners for longer periods yet refused to allocate more money for the additional guards who were needed (but could not be hired) to keep the prisons safe. Or when the Legislature refused to provide enough money for the Medicaid agency to provide the services it was required by federal and state law to provide — and also prohibited it from implementing cost-savings measures. While those are irresponsible policy choices, they are clearly choices the Legislature has a legitimate right to make. Cities and counties are receiving just 71 percent of what state law requires — the lowest portion ever. And the House wants to cut it even more. But cities and counties are run by elected officials, many of whom represent more people than House members do. And under our state constitution, they are responsible for running city and county governments. State law requires cities and counties to provide such state services as running election and voter registration offices and jails and providing security at the courthouse and indigent defense for people charged with state crimes. State law also requires the Legislature to provide cities and counties with an amount of money equal to 4.5 percent of the previous year’s state budget. That’s supposed to pay for providing those services. That means they should be getting $313 million this year, but they’re only getting $223 million. That’s just 71 percent of what the law requires and the lowest portion the Legislature has provided since … ever. It’s a smaller percent than the Legislature provided at the depths of the recession. As you might have imagined from the Sandifer tax-breaks-for-Wal-Mart bill, the Legislature doesn’t allow that. That will change next year if the House gets its way. Under the budget the House passed this week, local governments would receive … less. Not just less as a portion of the legal mandate: 65 percent. Less in total dollars: just $213 million. Some legislators apparently think it’s OK to reduce the Local Government Fund because they’re picking up part of the cost cities and counties otherwise would have to pay to shore up the State Retirement System. But it was legislators’ decision to make government agencies pick up more of the cost for the fix rather than splitting it evenly with employees — perhaps a legitimate decision, but one cities and counties had no say about, even though they employ a quarter of those employees. Further reducing reimbursements to local governments would be bad enough if our deadbeat Legislature allowed the duly elected representatives of cities and counties to levy taxes as they and their constituents saw fit. But as you might have guesssed from the Sandifer tax-breaks-for-Wal-Mart bill, it doesn’t. Beyond mandating tax give-aways, the Legislature limits both the type of taxes local governments can collect and how much they can increase them. So it’s often illegal for local officials to raise taxes enough to make up for the money the Legislature is required but refuses to provide them. So they have to reduce services. Returning the power of fiscal autonomy to cities and counties wouldn’t excuse the Legislature’s refusal to pay its bills. But at least it would give our local officials the option of providing the level of service that the people who live in the cities and counties are willing to pay for.

Tiffany shares have risen almost 15% this year. "With a strong brand that has supported pricing power historically coupled with recent and future talent upgrades, we believe shares can still rise from here," said a team of Jefferies analysts led by Randal J. Konik. Their investment outlook was based on four catalysts. Fashion jewelry comeback Tiffany is succeeding in its efforts to revive customer interest in fashion jewelry. "The reinvigoration of fashion jewelry is underway, visible to us (and consumers), and beginning to show in the numbers," they said. "Last quarter, fashion jewelry posted a modest increase year-over-year and sterling silver stabilized with sales up slightly due to the popularity of the Return to Tiffany Love Collection." Jefferies Tourism growth Tourists have long been a major source of sales for Tiffany, accounting for about 25% of total US sales and 40% of sales in its flagship New York store. "While challenges exist on the tourism front, travel and spending data indicate trends are stabilizing or improving," Jefferies said. "Total international passengers traveling to the US increased +1.0% y/y for the most recent fiscal quarter measured." Jefferies Pricing power Despite competition, Tiffany has built a strong brand with enough pricing power to protect margins. "With a higher-income consumer that is particularly strong given the recent rise in equity markets and well-positioned with the potential for lower personal income taxes," Jefferies said, "we believe TIF is one of a few retailers under our coverage with clear pricing power." Jefferies Growing market share Tiffany has grown its international market share, and looks set to maintain its growth. "Tiffany has used its strong brand name to gain share in the market," they said. "Given the market that Tiffany operates in, along with a strong brand that affords significant pricing power, the company is not susceptible to Amazon or Walmart." Jefferies Finally, Jefferies said Tiffany also trades below peers both on a P/E and EV/EBITDA basis. The company is expected to release its next quarterly earnings report on Friday. Previously, it reported a worldwide drop in comparable store sales of 2%, owing to exchange rate effects, during the holiday season of the two months ending December 31, 2016.

Joe Raedle Copyright Getty Images Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next KANSAS CITY, Mo. - Four people were charged Friday in a kidnapping where one victim was left bound and gagged in a Russell, Kansas field. Jeremy Dobson, 30, his brother Joshua Dobson, 25, Courtney `Devero, 25, and Justin D. Watson, 21, face charges of one count of kidnapping and one count of using of firearm during a violent crime, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Missouri in Kansas City. The two victims' ordeal began March 10 at a house near East 27th Street and Benton Boulevard in Kansas City. Jeremy Dobson allegedly got mad at a former girlfriend who was at the house. Dobson punched the woman in the face and a man pushed Dobson away, according to the news release. The affidavit says Dobson pulled a gun, pointed the weapon at the man and woman and fired a shot at the woman's head. The shot missed. Dobson allegedly made the two victims give him their cellphones and other personal items, according to the release. According to the affidavit, the pair were led to the basement, and the men, along with a juvenile girl, tied the victims to a pole with zip ties, rope and electrical wire. They allegedly took turns watching the victims, beating them and threatening to kill them, the news release says. In addition, the two victims spent several hours in a locked car trunk. Jeremy Dobson, Watson and the juvenile girl allegedly made the male victim get in a car and the group drove away. The affidavit says the woman pleaded with Joshua Dobson and Devero at the house to take her to a hospital, and they complied.  The news release says the woman had injuries to her wrists, ankles and face. Jeremy Watson allegedly drove the male victim and two others to Russell, Kansas. The male victim was left bound and gagged in a field there. He was able to free himself and walked to the Russell Police Department. Watson allegedly used the victim's debit card during the trip to get $1,200, according to the news release. They stopped again and Dobson allegedly bought Nike Air Jordan shoes, according to the news release. Justin Watson was asked to go to a Wal Mart while Jeremy Dobson and the juvenile girl waited in a motel room. Watson drove back to Kansas City without Dobson and the girl. Police arrested Watson, Devero and Joshua Dobson this week, but Jeremy Dobson is still on the run. ------   Follow 41 Action News on Twitter: Follow @41ActionNews Like 41 Action News on Facebook:   Copyright 2017 Scripps Media, Inc.
