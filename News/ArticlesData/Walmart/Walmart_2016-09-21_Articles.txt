Read: Sign of Bad Taste: A Walmart's 9/11 Soda Display Removed After It Sparks Outrage Mary Thomaston, a hairdresser from Panama City Beach, recently shared photos taken by Kiersten Grant on Instagram of her daughter's blue, purple and yellow dyed hair. "I really didn't want the dark blonde anymore, so I decided to color it," 6-year-old Lyra told InsideEdition.com. Her mom added, "I'm always doing fun colorful hair. She sees it all the time, and I have it myself so of course she's going to want it." But not everyone believed the decision was that simple. "Sometimes we forget they’re little and not a little doll," one person commented. Another wrote, "Oh no I would never let my baby do this [...] she can wait [until] she is older." But, Thomaston said she pays the negative comments no mind, responding in another post: "Don't worry folks it'll wash out. She wasn't harmed in the process. [...] It's hair....it'll grow back!" Thomaston told InsideEdition.com that in the three times Lyra has asked for her hair to be dyed, she used Manic Panic NYC's semi-permanent hair dye, which are advertised as non-toxic, ammonia-free, vegan, and temporary, despite people worrying the chemicals will harm her young daughter.  In fact, she said the hair dye even helps her daughter embrace her individuality.  "It helped her come out of her shell," Thomaston said. "She definitely likes to talk about it to everyone she sees, and it's really made her shine."  Read: Concerned Mom Speaks Out After She Said She Witnessed Man Pull Daughter by the Hair Through Walmart Clearly, Lyra has no plan to stop dyeing her unicorn-colored hair.

Witnesses have described the chaos of the assault. i By Matt Campbell mcampbell@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The alleged attackers at a Shawnee Wal-Mart earlier this month waited in a maroon van in the parking lot for more than an hour and 20 minutes while their victim was inside shopping with her 8-month-old child. Then when the mother returned to her car, which was parked next to the van, two men emerged from the van. The woman was attacked, struck in the head five to eight times before she was able to get away. Screaming for help, she then returned to the car to get her child before running back to the store while bleeding profusely. Those details and the further chaos that ensued are outlined in a court affidavit filed by the district attorney’s office against Arthur Fred Wyatt III, one of the men who was allegedly in the maroon van that Sunday afternoon. The affidavit relies upon witness accounts as well as surveillance video from the Wal-Mart parking lot. One of the men in the van, John Wesley Simmons III, was shot and killed by a good Samaritan who was in the parking lot at the time. But that was not before Simmons shot and critically wounded another good Samaritan, Joshua James Owen, who was not armed but who intervened in the attack on the woman. Police found Simmons dead and Owen wounded in the parking lot when they were called to the scene at 1:37 p.m. Sept. 11. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 0:31 KC Crime Stoppers seek suspects responsible for multiple burglaries Pause 0:54 Out-of-control car careens toward Merriam police officer working crash 1:08 KCK Police investigate shooting death of man found in backyard 2:20 Grandma of KCK boy fed to pigs recites a message she wrote to her grandson 0:35 Crime video: Man robs Hy-Vee Pharmacy in Leawood 0:30 KC police investigate shooting death on Jackson Avenue 0:39 Fairway police investigate shooting death 2:55 Boy rescued from attic now an honorary deputy 1:10 Kansas City officer injured following brief scuffle 3:08 Darryl Burton gives sermon at United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in Leawood 0:34 Kansas City police SUV collides with stolen Jeep 4:22 Raw video: Dashcam shows Independence police using StarChase GPS tags Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Police describe people coming to aid of Shawnee Wal-Mart robbery victim Two Good Samaritans came to the aid of a woman who was being attacked in a Shawnee Wal-Mart parking lot on Sunday afternoon. Police describe what took place during the attempted robbery that ended with one attacker dead and the woman and one Good Samaritan in the hospital. Laura Bauer, Joe Ledford and Robert A. Cronkleton The Kansas City Star   Based on the video, prosecutors say there was an encounter between the woman, identified only as M.D.J., and a man, and then “multiple people suddenly converge on the two vehicles.” At some point, a second man is seen getting out of the passenger side of the van. The woman later told authorities she was attacked from behind by at least two people. She said they initially pushed her toward her car’s open door and then began pulling her left arm away from the vehicle. That is when she broke free and ran. According to the affidavit, Simmons was then seen getting back into the maroon van on the driver’s side and closing the door. Owen approached the driver’s side door, and Simmons got out on the passenger side. Owen then ran around the van and tackled Simmons to the ground. The two men rolled and fought in the parking and when they separated, “Simmons raises his hand and appears to be firing a weapon at Owen.” Owen was struck by three bullets, in the wrist, chest and face. Part of his nose was shot off, and the left side of his face was damaged. A GoFundMe page for Owen had raised more than $140,000 for his medical bills as of Thursday afternoon. The second good Samaritan, whose name was redacted in the affidavit, “then comes toward the area, draws a weapon and fires at Simmons,” the affidavit said. “Simmons was struck multiple times and died at the scene.” The second man from the van was seen running east in the direction of a Target store. An employee of that store called police, saying a man in the store appeared jittery and was talking on a cellphone in a “low, shaky hyper voice.” The man was seen on Target surveillance video being picked up by someone in a dark-colored passenger vehicle. Speaking with Simmons’ family, police learned he had spent time that morning with an acquaintance named Art, whose Facebook profile identified him as Art Tha Topp Hatt. Photos on the page fit witness descriptions of the second man in the van at Wal-Mart. Information from Facebook led to Wyatt in a police database, the affidavit said. A witness, whose name also was redacted in the affidavit, told police Simmons and Wyatt had dropped her off at church that morning in a maroon van. The clothing she said Wyatt was wearing matched the Target video, and she positively identified the man in the video as Wyatt. Wyatt’s father, Arthur Fred Wyatt Jr., later told police he picked his son up at the Target store and he appeared to be nervous. Wyatt Jr. said his son told him he and Simmons had been at Wal-Mart, and he had fled when there was an altercation between Simmons and a woman. But another man who had been in the Wal-Mart parking lot and had tried to help the woman being attacked gave police descriptions of the two men. The larger one, matching Simmons, pointed a gun at him, the man said. The other one, matching Wyatt, was striking the woman over the head with a gun. The woman’s wounds required 26 staples to close. Wyatt is charged with attempted first-degree murder, attempted aggravated kidnapping and attempted aggravated robbery.

In some parts of open-carry America, even a trip to Wal-Mart can require an AR-15 By Terrence Mccoy Washington Post Twitter Facebook Email Reddit WINDER, Ga. – All Jim Cooley wants to do is buy some soda. “You want to come to Wal-Mart?” he asks his wife. “No,” Maria says. “Pretty please?” Jim asks. “I’m not going to sit there and have the police called on you. I mean, I don’t want to see that crap,” Maria says, knowing what a trip to Wal-Mart means. She knows her 51-year-old husband has two guns inside the house, and this afternoon it won’t be the 9 mm, which he straps on with a round in the chamber when grabbing lunch at his favorite fast-food restaurant or visiting a friend’s auto shop. It’ll be the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, which he brings when going somewhere he thinks is dangerous, like the Atlanta airport, where he’s taken it loaded with a 100-bullet drum, or Wal-Mart, where he thinks crowds could pose easy targets for terrorists. In a country of relaxing gun laws where it’s now legal to open-carry in 45 states and there are 14.5 million people with carry permits, every day seems to bring a new version of what open carry can mean. In Kentucky, it’s now legal to open-carry in city buildings. In downtown Cleveland, people carried military-style rifles during the Republican National Convention. In Howell, Michigan, last month, a father went openly armed to his child’s middle-school orientation. In Mississippi, it’s now legal to open-carry without a permit at all. And in Georgia, which has passed a “guns everywhere” bill and has issued nearly 1 million carry permits, Jim Cooley is staking out his version of what’s acceptable as he keeps pleading with his wife. “I got to get soda.” Maria sighs. She worked the night before assembling air-conditioner compressors at a nearby factory, and in a few hours, she knows she’ll have to leave for another third shift. “Yeah,” she says, giving in. “I might as well get this travesty out of the way.” “What travesty?” “You carrying a big ol’ rifle in the store, scaring the hell out of all the Wal-Mart shoppers.” “There’s no difference between carrying a rifle and carrying a handgun,” he says. “You tried that last time, remember?” Maria says, stepping into a pair of flip-flops and running her fingers through her hair. “And what happened? Barrow County sheriffs. Three or four of them.” “They can’t tell me what and what not to carry,” Jim says. “You know I wouldn’t listen to them anyway.” “Well, you go one way in the store; I’ll go the other,” Maria says. “Then when they say, ‘Ma’am, do you know this person?’ I’ll say, ‘No, I’ve never seen him before in my life.’ ” He places a lit cigarette into an ashtray, walks into his bedroom, reaches behind its door, picks up the AR-15, snaps in a magazine with 15 rounds and slings the rifle around his left shoulder so it rests against his torso. “Ready?” he asks. “Yeah,” she says, grabbing her purse and following her husband out the door for an afternoon trip to Wal-Mart to buy soda. The gun Jim Cooley carries is the ATI Omni-Hybrid Maxx AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. It cost him $579.99. It weighs 6.25 pounds, is 35 inches long, and fires bullets as fast as the trigger can be pulled, and, as Jim has learned, fits nicely between the front seats of a white minivan with peeling paint on the front and a bumper sticker on the back that says, “I (heart) Law.” Jim goes everywhere now with a gun – if not the AR-15, then his sidearm – and is so reliant on one being close by that it surprises him to think the majority of his life was lived otherwise. He was raised in a working-class family in Chicago, where he can’t imagine living now because of its strict gun laws. But they didn’t bother him then. He didn’t hunt. He didn’t fear for his safety. If his dad had a gun, no one knew. He grew up without a gun, went to church without a gun, married Maria without a gun, began raising two children without a gun, and settled into a life that felt as safe as it was dependable. But then it began unraveling, starting when he was fired from a trucking job days after telling Maria, who was pregnant with their first child, to quit her job and focus on the baby, that he could support them both. Their first bankruptcy filing wasn’t far behind, then the second, and the third, and then they were moving to Florida, where Maria had family and where Jim got a job with a grocery chain. It transferred him to Winder, and he moved the family into a middle-class neighborhood struggling with crime and drugs. Jim now steers past the house of a neighbor who sold him his first gun – a .380 semi-automatic for $100 – so he could protect his family from that crime, then past Winder’s only gun shop where he took his dad so he could buy a gun, too. He lights a cigarette, feels the breeze from an open window because the air conditioner is broken, and takes a sip of soda from a big mug that says Athens Regional Medical Center. It’s a memento of sorts from the day in late 2008 when he emerged from that hospital with three stents in his heart, debts worth $41,052.51 and a dawning realization he was now disabled, broke and would never work again. After the heart attack, he lost most of the circulation in his legs, received three more stents and started using an electric scooter whenever he had to walk long distances. He told Maria he was all used up, a drag on the family. She should think about leaving him. But she wouldn’t, even after the hospital sued him for unpaid medical bills, even after he was arrested when he carried his .380 outside a school board meeting, even after he came home one day with an AR-15. He shot it at a nearby firing range and, feeling a sense of control that had gone missing in his life, told Maria he could now keep the family safe. She now sits at his side, as always, in the passenger seat. At first, she didn’t understand the changes she saw in the man she married 24 years ago. Why did he suddenly want a gun when he never mentioned one before? Why did he want her to get one, too? Why did he put two four-inch knives inside the car’s passenger-side door? And why all the security cameras? Maria glances at a small screen beneath the rearview mirror: It shows feeds from surveillance cameras affixed inside the car that start recording when someone turns the ignition. But Maria went along with all of it. She bought a .380 semi-automatic and has gotten used to taking it with her wherever she goes. She got used to the cameras, too, including the seven Jim placed around the house’s perimeter. She began to understand why he was so concerned about crime, about terrorists, about the need to protect their family because they couldn’t count on the government to do it for them. Last year, when he showed her his new AR-15 and asked her to shoot it, she did, feeling intimidated afterward. But then she did it again. And when he started bringing the rifle not just to the range, but to Atlanta, to the airport, inside Wal-Mart, she eventually went along with that, too. So much of her life involves accommodating him now, including just before they left for Wal-Mart and he asked her to send a Facebook message to a local deputy about his plans. “What do you want me to tell him?” Maria had asked. “Say, ‘Hey, buddy, I’m going to Wal-Mart, and I’m going to have my AR with me, so if any call comes over the radio, you know it’s me,” Jim told her. Maria sat at a laptop in a bedroom cluttered with stacks of documents, some of which detailed foreclosure proceedings against the house, and saw the browser had 35 tabs open. One was a YouTube video of something called “Police State 101.” Another showed the dictionary definition of the word “law.” Another was a fringe website her husband classifies as “underground,” the sort he started visiting more frequently after he joined a Georgia militia in late 2014 and decided it was up to him to protect his family from foreign and government threats. She messaged the deputy, then looked at Jim’s Facebook page. It bore pictures of her husband carrying guns and posts about a country dissolving into chaos and videos about people stopping intruders with guns, people killing burglars with guns, people shooting big guns, small guns, all kinds of guns, that he watches late into the night. She came back to the kitchen table, where Jim sat and smoked. “At least I notified the sheriff’s department ahead of time,” he said. He looked at Maria. “Come on, come to Wal-Mart with me,” he said. “I got to get soda.” So she went along with that, too, and now here she is, pulling into a parking spot outside Wal-Mart, and her husband is reaching for an AR-15 that he tells her sometimes he would have no problem using against a thief breaking into their house, or a violent protester in the streets of Milwaukee, or a terrorist in Syria, or, if necessary, even a stray dog on their lawn. The Wal-Mart Supercenter is outside of downtown Winder, next to the Subway, the Great Clips, the GameStop and buffered by a parking lot that can easily fit hundreds of cars, but is rarely more than half-full on weekdays. There are two entrances. One is beside the landscaping section and says “Home and Garden” above the doorway. The other, which Jim now walks through, leads to another Subway, this one just inside the supercenter. As Maria goes ahead, Jim veers to the right, where he climbs into a complimentary electric scooter, repositions his AR-15 so its barrel points toward the scuffed vinyl floor, and rolls into the store. “Hey, Maria,” he calls when catching up to her. “Do we need any lunch meat?” “I’ll go get some salami,” she says. “All right,” he says, now alone, and accelerates the scooter deeper into the store, crossing into the grocery section. Two middle-aged women stand beside a refrigerator, talking. One of them looks at Jim, sees the gun around his neck and goes silent. The other woman turns, and when she sees the gun, her expression freezes, too. But it’s not the fearful looks that Jim notices as he rolls past. It’s a nearby sale. “Eighty-eight cents for a loaf,” he says and keeps moving toward the back of the store. Not everyone sees his AR-15, which is partially obscured by the cart. One man walks past without a second look. So does a woman, making her way into the clothing section. One couple give Jim wide berth, their eyes on his scooter and, briefly, his gun. And then Jim gets where he’s going – the soda aisle – and sees what he’s looking for. He reaches out and, grunting, pulls free a 24-pack of Diet Dr. Thunder. Trying not to jostle the AR-15, he leans forward and, twisting awkwardly, drops the box into the scooter’s front cart, accidentally tearing it open. “They don’t make these things like they used to,” he says quietly and grabs another 24-pack of Diet Dr. Thunder, placing this one inside the cart more gently. In search of Maria, he continues into the dairy section, where he wheels past a father and his young daughter who stares at his rifle, into aisle 9, where he puts a large can of Great Value Classic Roast Coffee into his cart, and finally back to the front of the supercenter, where he sees Maria ordering salami. She takes the soda and coffee out of his cart and places it in her own. She gestures at a nearby cheesecake. “They got strawberry swirl,” she says. He is leaning forward. The muzzle of the loaded gun is pressing against his shoe. Now it’s sliding under his shoelaces. “Give me the strawberry swirl,” he says, and as Maria heads toward the checkout line with the cheesecake, the salami, the coffee and the soda, he straightens up and the muzzle slides free of his shoe. He steers toward the front doors, parks the scooter, slowly stands and walks outside, and that’s when a group of employees standing just outside the entrance notices the gun. “Is that what I see?” one will later recall saying. “What do we do if he comes in the store?” “If someone feels uncomfortable, what can we do?” They continue staring as Jim walks into the parking lot toward the car. “You know my grandfather was murdered, right?” one of the employees says, and as they launch into a discussion of a robbery and shooting that happened in 1973, they are in the midst of a late summer afternoon in 2016 with its own set of shootings. In California, by the end of this day, a 61-year-old man will have been shot to death at a car wash. In Virginia, an intruder will have burst into a home and killed a 24-year-old man inside. In Missouri, a woman will have shot and killed a man she said was chasing her. And meanwhile, in Georgia, Jim is braking hard on the ride home, causing his AR-15 to topple forward. “Can you hold onto that for me, please?” he asks Maria. “Yeah,” she says, putting the gun back where it was, and without further incident they continue on their way home, where Jim puts away his AR-15, sits down at the kitchen table and takes a drink of Diet Dr. Thunder.

The money went to the Southwest Oklahoma Community Action Group in Altus and the Community Action Development Corporation in Frederick. The group provides a hot midday meal five days a week to citizens 60 years of age or older in Greer, Harmon and Jackson County. “The senior nutrition program offers more than just meals,” said Virginia Goskey, senior nutrition program director for SOCAG. “The program gives seniors a place to socialize and develop friendships, connects them to many vital resources in the community and makes them feel accepted and cared for. In a word, the senior nutrition program gives hope.” It will be used to help with their senior nutrition programs. The Walmart Foundation grant will help pay staff salaries and buy food and supplies for the senior nutrition program, which offers senior citizens the choice of having their meal in a congregate setting or through home delivery. Every participant is given monthly nutrition education via pamphlets and/or on-site training. Congregant participants have the opportunity take advantage of monthly health checks, games and entertainment, and exercise equipment. “These two organizations do so much for our rural communities. They provide meals, they provide transportation, they work with head start. and we're just so thankful for the Walmart Foundation and all that they do to help fund organizations like these,” said Rep. Jeff Coody of District 63. Coody says the Walmart Foundation grant will offset budget cuts from federal and state grants that at one time entirely funded the programs. “Walmart, and the Walmart Foundation, understand that organizations such as Southwest Oklahoma Community Action Group are essential to building stronger communities. They share our values and are committed to helping those in need in the communities we serve,” said Rodney Walker, Walmart vice president and regional general manager. “Through this grant, we are hopeful that residents in this area will feel a positive effect, and through that effect our impact will be expanded.” The Walmart Foundation’s State Giving Program supports organizations that create opportunities so people can live better, awarding grants that have a long-lasting, positive impact on communities across the U.S. To be considered for support, prospective grantee organizations must submit applications through the Walmart Foundation State Giving Program’s online grant application. Applicants must have a current 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status in order to meet the program’s minimum eligibility criteria. Additional information about the program’s funding guidelines and application process are available online at www.walmartfoundation.org/stategiving. Copyright 2016 KSWO. All rights reserved.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Boy arrested in Wal-Mart fire Thursday Sep 22, 2016 at 12:27 PM Sep 22, 2016 at 3:12 PM Jose Quintero Staff Writer @dd_jquintero BARSTOW — Barstow police arrested a 12-year-old boy they believe started a fire in the arts and crafts section at Wal-Mart on Wednesday afternoon. The blaze caused an estimated $1 million-plus in damage to the store, authorities said. The Barstow Police Department dispatch center received a call regarding a fire inside the business and preliminary investigation indicated that it had intentionally set. A detective from the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department Arson and Bomb Unit responded and determined that the fire's cause was arson. “Detectives processed the scene, interviewed witnesses, and reviewed the Wal-Mart surveillance footage,” Capt. Andy Espinoza Jr. said. “Detectives were able to identify the possible arson suspect on the surveillance video. The suspect appeared to be a young Hispanic male juvenile, wearing a green T-shirt with distinctive markings and black pants. The juvenile suspect was captured on video leaving Wal-Mart riding a push scooter and wearing a backpack.” Detectives searched the area and located a boy on a scooter near Rimrock Road and Opal Street. He was wearing the same clothes as seen on the surveillance footage, police said. Espinoza said detectives obtained additional evidence linking the boy to the arson. The boy was arrested on suspicion of arson, his parents were notified and he was transported to the High Desert Juvenile Detention Center in Apple Valley. Paramedics treated several people for smoke inhalation, according to police. The Barstow Fire Protection District extinguished the fire, which began at 1:59 p.m. Espinoza said several employees immediately tried to put out the fire with extinguishers but were unsuccessful and the store was immediately evacuated. The investigation is ongoing and anyone with information is asked to call Det. Keith Libby at 760-255-5134.

The allegations included that Walmart’s Mexican unit paid millions of dollars in bribes to speed building permits and gain other favors. In a ruling this week, U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey in Fayetteville, Ark., dismissed Walmart’s argument that a Michigan retirement fund could not lead a class-action suit because it suffered no related financial losses. Walmart’s stance was based on a certain accounting method. But Hickey ruled that the pension fund, the City of Pontiac General Employees’ Retirement System, showed losses using another accounting method and that Walmart failed to adequately explain why its accounting method was preferable. ALSO Facebook adds FacioMetrics; a mansplaining hotline Judge scolds SF, Airbnb while staying fines in short-term rental case Airbnb aims to handle full-service travel, competing with Expedia “Judicial economy and the best interests of the class members favor class certification,” Hickey wrote. Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Walmart, said the company is considering its options, including an appeal. “We continue to believe that the claims here are not appropriate for certifying class,” he said. Investors said Walmart knew about the bribery scheme as early as 2005, seven years before allegations were made public by the New York Times. The newspaper reported that top executives had covered up the finding of an internal investigation and didn’t alert U.S. or Mexican authorities until after the paper said it was investigating the issue. In July, a federal appeals court rejected a shareholder lawsuit filed against key directors at Walmart that claimed they allowed and concealed alleged bribery in the company’s Mexico division. Chief Judge William Riley wrote for the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that shareholders, including the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees’ Retirement System, did “not give rise to a reasonable reference” that the board of directors learned of the suspected bribery while it was being covered up and the internal investigation squashed. That upheld an Arkansas district court’s dismissal. Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

While e-tailing giant Amazon.com is considered an online price leader today, “the reality is they’re a little bit all over the place in pricing,” Bishop said. Bentonville, Ark.-based Walmart completed its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet earlier this week. As previously reported, the deal brings together fast-growing and well-funded Jet.com — which in just over a year zoomed to an estimated $1 billion in annual sales on a hot brand and “dynamic pricing” model — with Walmart, which has a considerably less sexy url, but one with ambitions to build an e-commerce brand as mighty as its store fleet. What both have in common is a reputation for price central to their brands in a way that most other competitors in the e-commerce field do not, Bishop explained. This, he said, holds the promise of distinguishing its offering, particularly in areas like grocery where shoppers can be particularly price sensitive. Walmart said it would appoint Jet founder Marc Lore to head up its combined e-commerce operations, replacing Neil Ashe. It is expected that Lore will bring Jet’s technical expertise in dynamic pricing — which rewards shoppers with lower prices for saving Jet the costs associated with virtual retailing such as volume discounts, shipping discounts and even payment method discounts — to Walmart. “Walmart bought three things with Jet,” said Neil Stern, senior partner with McMillanDoolittle, told SN. “They bought talent. They bought an algorithm. And they got Jet itself, a different brand with a slightly different shopper base. I think they feel that will help broaden their appeal.” In a blog post published earlier this week, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon characterized the shopper bases as “complementary.” “Jet.com is a hit among urban Millennials, and it will continue to focus on delivering premium brands and experiences,” he said. “Walmart.com is winning value-conscious shoppers with everyday low prices by keeping costs low.” Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 3 rllayman on Sep 23, 2016 what's so great at being "the price leader" if the cost to ship goods is greater than the profit margin generated from selling the goods. But maybe Walmart should consider rebranding its stores for urban markets and other high income demographic RTAs. They could call the stores "Jet". Because I think their foray into urban markets is running into the problem that the company's traditional market is comprised of low income demographics, and people with options are exercising their privilege of not shopping there. reply Log In or Register to post comments Kevin C.

Stumbled upon Jet and bought a case of 18 at $2.61 each. If I continued to buy more products the price continues to drop.

The Chambers County Commission, the City of LaFayette, the Chambers County Development Authority, and AL Solar A have finalized a project agreement and tax abatement agreement to locate a massive 72-megawatt solar farm on a 1,100-acre site that encompasses portions of both LaFayette and unincorporated Chambers County. Prior to the approval of the project and abatement agreements, Alabama Power announced in June of this year that an agreement with Walmart to purchase renewable energy had been approved by the Alabama Public Service Commission, opening the door for a large-scale solar generating facility to locate in the area. As part of the long-term contract with Alabama Power, Walmart will purchase a majority of the solar farm’s output, known as renewable energy credits (RECs). Those RECs will be retired on Walmart’s behalf. Because Walmart is not purchasing all of the farm’s output, Alabama Power will be able to market the remaining RECs to other customers who have an interest in renewable energy. Miami-based Origis Energy, a worldwide leader in solar energy development, financing, construction and operations, and parent company of AL Solar A, will construct and operate the 72-megawatt solar farm, while Alabama Power has secured the rights to the energy produced at the facility. Construction on the solar farm is expected to begin later this year, and is scheduled to be completed and operational in late 2017. “This project is the first of its kind in Alabama, and we are proud that LaFayette will be home to one of the largest solar energy generating farms in the Southeast,” Chambers County Development Authority Executive Director Valerie Gray said. “A project of this type is an exciting and unique opportunity that not only provides an immediate positive economic impact to Chambers County but also gives us an added resource as we work to diversify our industrial base and bring more jobs to the citizens of LaFayette.” The direct and indirect economic impact of the project for LaFayette and Chambers County will be significant. Along with a substantial capital investment that will yield an immediate financial inflow to the local school systems, the project will create approximately 200-300 jobs during the construction phase and up to five jobs during the 30-35-year operation lifespan of the solar farm. The project has been welcomed with widespread enthusiasm from both LaFayette and Chambers County officials. Chambers County Commission Chair Joe Blanks called it “an amazing win for Chambers County.” “It’s thrilling that this project has come together and will locate here in LaFayette,” Mayor Barry Moody said. “This is an incredible and distinctive opportunity for our community and just another indication that we are on the move here in LaFayette. We are excited about this partnership with Origis Energy and for the opportunities it will provide to our current and future citizens and businesses.” Related posts: Alabama Power Teams with Walmart for Solar Energy Facility in Chambers County Solar facility to employ up to 300 Large scale solar panel farm may come to Chambers County City agrees to solar farm tax abatements   0 0 0   0   0 previous $27K new tab for inmate housing next CCTC Automotive Program Receives National Accreditation slandon Related Posts aFayette honors veterans November 17, 2016 slandon 0 Wildfires, water restriction result of worst drought November 17, 2016 slandon 0 Dynamite found near school November 17, 2016 slandon 0 Subscribe to The LaFayette Sun First Name Last Name Email Address Submit Facebook Like Box Facebook Copyright 2016, The LaFayette Sun Close News Featured Stories Top Stories Government Police & Courts Senior Living Sports School Obituaries Columns Videos Letters to the Editor Community Announcements Classified View Classified Ads How to Submit News × REPORT THIS [contact-form-7 404 "Not Found"] Share this video

The decision was handed down on Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey in Arkansas, who rejected claims by the world’s largest retailer that a Michigan pension fund has no legal standing to lead the case because it had not suffered any stock losses. The suit was originally filed in 2012 and accused the chain store of bribing Mexican officials to speed up approval for the opening of new stores. The bribes allegedly began in 2005 and for the next seven years Wal-Mart allegedly dished out at least $24 million in “suspect payments” to facilitate construction of Mexican stores, according to a report by the New York Times. Lawyers for the Michigan pension fund – the City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System – argue that Wal-Mart’s former Chief Executive Officer, Michael Duke, and other board members failed to meticulously investigate the claims of bribery even though they were told about it in 2005. Wal-Mart has steadfastly said that the claims made by the pension funds and others do not a warrant lawsuit. In May, the company persuaded a Delaware judge to toss out claims filed by another set of shareholders that accused directors of bungling the handling of the Mexican bribery scandal. Wal-Mart argued that an accounting method prevented the pension fund from showing it lost money on stock, but Hickey said the fund could show losses under another accounting method and that Wal-Mart failed to show why its preferred method was better. “This was a procedural ruling that has nothing to do with the merits of the case,” Randy Hargrove, a Wal-Mart spokesman, said in an e-mail to Bloomberg. “We continue to believe the claims here are not appropriate for class treatment.” Wal-Mart’s market value plummeted by roughly $17 billion over three days in April 2012 following The New York Times Pulitzer Prize-winning report. Since then, the company has spent $439 million in connection with investigations into allegations that employees paid bribes not only in Mexico, but also in China, India and Brazil, according to regulatory filings. There are also open investigations in both the U.S. and Mexico into Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB, one of the Latin American nation’s largest private employers with more than 200,000 workers.

The allegations included that Wal-Mart's Mexican unit paid millions of dollars in bribes to speed building permits and gain other favors. In a ruling this week, US District Judge Susan Hickey in Fayetteville, Arkansas, dismissed Wal-Mart's argument that a Michigan retirement fund could not lead a class-action suit because it suffered no related financial losses. Wal-Mart's stance was based on a certain accounting method. But Hickey ruled that the pension fund, the City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System, showed losses using another accounting method and that Wal-Mart failed to adequately explain why its accounting method was preferable. "Judicial economy and the best interests of the class members favor class certification," Hickey wrote. Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, said the company is considering its options, including an appeal. "We continue to believe that the claims here are not appropriate for certifying a class," he said. Investors said Wal-Mart knew about the bribery scheme as early as 2005, seven years before allegations were made public by The New York Times. The newspaper reported that top executives had covered up the finding of an internal investigation and didn't alert US or Mexican authorities until after the paper said it was investigating the issue. In July, a federal appeals court rejected a shareholder lawsuit filed against key directors at Wal-Mart that claimed they allowed and concealed alleged bribery in the company's Mexico division. Chief Judge William Riley wrote for the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals that shareholders, including the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees' Retirement System, did "not give rise to a reasonable reference" that the board of directors learned of the suspected bribery while it was being covered up and the internal investigation squashed. That upheld an Arkansas district court's dismissal.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Sep 22, 2016 at 12:36PM Seven is Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) lucky number. This morning, for the seventh time this year (according to StreetInsider.com), Amazon stock received a new buy rating on Wall Street. That sounds like good news for owners of Amazon stock -- and it is. The stock has gained 1.6% in response to the new upgrade already. But here's some even better news for folks who own the stock: The analyst upgrading Amazon this morning is Argus Research. According to our records on Motley Fool CAPS, Argus Research is one of the best stock pickers on Wall Street. Since 2008, when we first began tracking the analyst's performance, Argus' stock picks have outperformed the S&P 500 by better than 17 percentage points per pick, an outstanding record that places the analyst in the top 10% of investors we track. And now it likes Amazon. Here are three things you need to know about that. Amazon's Fire is on sale, and Argus says so is Amazon stock -- on sale, and also on fire! Image source: Amazon.com. 1. Why Argus likes it As explained in a write-up on TheFly.com this morning, Argus likes Amazon for three main reasons: First, it owns "well more than half" of the infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) market via its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Second, Amazon's online retail business is growing faster than its stock price. And third, Argus believes Amazon.com is a long-term buy -- so long as the first two trends remain true. Argus rates the stock a buy and predicts Amazon.com stock will hit $935 a share within the next year. 2. Amazon is one expensive stock All that being said, Argus does admit that Amazon stock sells for "rich multiples." Up 47% in value over the past 52 weeks, Amazon stock has never -- ever -- cost more than it does today. One single share of Amazon.com stock currently costs more than $802. By contrast, the second-biggest online retailer of general goods, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), carries a per-share price in only the double-digits (about $72), and the third-biggest, Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) is priced only in the single digits -- $8 and change. 3. Amazon is expensive...but not really Is that too much to pay? Triple-digit valuations on the No. 1 retailer, when the No. 2 sells for double digits and the No. 3 player, just single digits? Before you answer, remember that Amazon, Wal-Mart, and Staples are more than just stocks. They're also businesses. No matter how much a share of any of these companies' stocks costs, to know how expensive the business is, you need to add up all the shares that it has been carved into, multiply them by the stock price, and whatever you get -- the stock's market capitalization -- is how much the whole business costs. Do that, and what you'll find is that Staples has a market capitalization of $5.5 billion, Wal-Mart Stores $223.4 billion, and Amazon.com $381.5 billion. The most important thing: Valuation Viewed from this perspective, you can see that Amazon.com, as a business, does indeed cost more than Wal-Mart -- but only 71% more, not 1,110% more. (It's still a heckuvalot more expensive than Staples, though?) Now the question becomes: Is Amazon worth it? Let's consider. Focusing on the Wal-Mart/Amazon race, Wal-Mart stock currently sells for 10.5 times trailing free cash flow, while Amazon stock has a price-to-FCF ratio of 51.6. On the other hand, analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence see Wal-Mart growing its profits at only about 5% annually over the next five years, versus Amazon growing at 55% annually -- 11 times as fast as Wal-Mart. As a function of price-to-FCF-to-growth, therefore, Wal-Mart has a ratio of 2.0, while Amazon has a ratio of 0.9. (In fact, when you dig into the numbers, these analysts see Amazon's free cash flow roughly doubling in size between 2015 and 2017, between 2016 and 2108, and only then beginning to slow down -- doubling again between 2017 and 2020.) What that tells me is that not only is Amazon.com stock relatively cheaper than Wal-Mart, it also suggests that Amazon.com stock is cheap, period -- even at $802 a share, even at $381.5 billion in market cap, and even at a P/E ratio of 200. Long story short? Argus is right about Amazon selling for slightly terrifying "rich multiples." It's also right that the company is growing more than fast enough to justify those multiples. And Argus is right when it says Amazon.com stock is a buy. Fool contributor Rich Smith does not own shares of, nor is he short, any company named above.

Zahnow, 41, on Thursday, Sept. 22, appeared before Bay County Circuit Judge Harry P. Gill and pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated indecent exposure. The charge is normally a two-year high court misdemeanor, but Zahnow also pleaded as a habitual offender with a third-offense sentencing enhancement. As a result, Zahnow's maximum potential penalty is increased to four years' incarceration. As Zahnow was on probation when his most recent crime occurred, he is also subject to consecutive sentencing, meaning he'd have to serve the remainder of the time associated with his prior offenses before he begins chipping away at his latest term. The prosecution did not agree to dismiss any additional charges, as Zahnow did not face any. In a Cobbs hearing — in which a judge outlines the likely sentence a defendant will face if convicted — Judge Gill agreed to sentence Zahnow within the sentencing guidelines. Those guidelines have yet to be drafted by the Bay County Probation Department. Man on probation for having child porn charged with flashing kids at Walmart Aggravated indecent exposure involves fondling one's genitals, where standard indecent exposure is only displaying genitals, Michigan law states. The latter is a one-year misdemeanor. Zahnow's offense occurred about 4:25 p.m. Thursday, June 30, in the Walmart at 3921 E. Wilder Road. At the arraignment, Bay County Assistant Prosecutor Bernard J. Coppolino said Zahnow followed and spoke with two 7-year-old girls before flashing them. Bay County Undersheriff Troy Cunningham previously said the girls were in the toy aisle while the mother of one of the girls was in an adjacent aisle. The girls told the woman what had occurred, and she then told store security, who were unable to immediately locate the man. Investigating police had an idea Zahnow was the culprit by the following morning, Cunningham previously said. Deputies located and arrested Zahnow later that day. Records indicate Zahnow in October 2007 was sentenced to 10 years of probation in Wisconsin's Ozaukee County after being convicted of two counts of possessing child pornography. The charge is a 25-year felony in Wisconsin. The Wisconsin Department of Corrections' website indicates Zahnow must register as a sex offender until Oct. 3, 2032. The site also states Zahnow is compliant in his registration, having last registered his Bay City address on May 2. As a sex offender, Zahnow was already prohibited from having contact with any child besides his own. Judge Gill is to sentence Zahnow at 1:30 p.m. on Monday, Oct. 31.

The incident came to light after Erika Burch, a customer at Walmart in Cleveland, Texas, saw a man pulling his young daughter alongside his shopping cart by her hair. Buch said that the father had the girl's hair wrapped around the cart handle, as she cried out in pain and begged him to stop. Burch later wrote on her Facebook page, "She was saying, 'Please stop, I promise I won’t do it again, please stop!'" Burch immediately took out her phone to document the man's actions before approaching him and asking him to stop. The man told her to "mind her own business," so Burch called the police. A police officer who was already in the Walmart came running, according to Burch, and called his sergeant, who reportedly told Burch that in order for the police to arrest the man for child abuse, the child needed to be physically injured. "The sergeant in Cleveland, TX said, "He has the right to discipline his children,'" Burch wrote. Burch shared the photos and story of what happened on her Facebook following the incident, and as of this morning, the post has been shared by over 205,000 Facebook users. See the photos she posted, below: Pinterest Facebook PHOTO: Erika Burch/Facebook Pinterest Facebook PHOTO: Erika Burch/Facebook Pinterest Facebook PHOTO: Erika Burch/Facebook Pinterest Facebook PHOTO: Erika Burch/Facebook Cleveland Police Chief Darrel Broussard told the local CBS affiliate that his department is taking the case seriously and has launched an investigation. Broussard said Child Protective Services is also investigating. The Cleveland Police Department posted this message regarding the incident on their Facebook page: Broussard also said that he appreciates Burch for speaking up when she saw something dangerous unfolding. "Of course, that old saying, 'if you see something, say something.' In this case, I have to applaud those witnesses who attempted to intervene for the safety of the child," he told the news station.

Atkins was convicted of capital murder Thursday, Sept. 22 and faces the death penalty or life in prison without parole.Prescotte Stokes III/pstokes@al.com  A jury in Mobile County has found 22-year-old Saraya Atkins guilty of capital murder, robbery and theft in the 2014 shooting death of Robert Perry, 66. Police say Atkins and another woman, Kymberli Lindsay, 27 robbed and then killed Perry. Perry was shot to death on March 11, 2014. As the jury deliberated on a verdict, D.A. Ashley Rich consoled the nine family members of Perry as they waited for the jury's decision.  Atkins' eight family members sat shoulder to shoulder in the rows across from Perry's. Before the jury gave the verdict, five police officers came into the courtroom and filled the middle rows in case there was an emotional out burst from family members.  After the verdict was read and the judge dismissed the jurors, Atkins put her head down and burst into tears. After she was led out with officers, she could be heard crying loudly in the hallway near the judges' chambers.  The trial will now enter a penalty phase where the jury will decide if Atkins should receive the death penalty or life without parole. The District Attorney's office will now push for the death penalty as their stance has been that Perry's murder was premeditated by Atkins. Atkins attorneys will push back and continue to assert that the robbery was the only part of the incident that was premeditated. If they are able to convince the jury of that in the penalty phase Atkins would receive a life without parole sentence.  The shooting came after Perry had been asked by his stepdaughter Stephanie Finney, 45, to take her to look at a used car she wanted to purchase from a man on Craigslist. Perry, said Rich earlier in the trial, drove his wife's red Toyota Prius to Finney's home on Bayou Jonas Drive to pick her up. Finney had planned on cashing her $1,900 income tax check at the money store in the Wal-Mart in Tillman's Corner and meet the seller of the used car at that same Wal-Mart. Rich told jurors Atkins had been facing some personal troubles of her own that led her and Lindsay to cross paths with Perry and Finney that day. "She didn't have any money and she was going to get the money she needed," said Rich. Rich said Atkins and Lindsay decided to ride to the Bel-Air Mall and find a license plate to steal off another white Chevrolet vehicle that matched her own. Rich said video surveillance at the Dillard's store shows both women unscrewing the license plate off a woman's vehicle and putting it on Atkins car. As soon as Finney left the store, Lindsay followed her to see what vehicle she gets into before getting back in the car with Atkins. Perry and Finney drove to the back side of the Garden Center at Wal-Mart and meet the seller of the used car. Atkins and Lindsay pull into a parking space at a distance and watch. Finney decides not to buy the car after checking it out with Perry and they decide to head home. Atkins and Lindsay realize this and follow the pair, 15 miles away, to Bayou Jonas Drive. Once they get about half way up the street, Atkins speeds up and cuts Perry off forcing him to slam on his brakes and hit the rear of Atkins car in the wet weather. "She gets out the car with that loaded revolver screaming, 'Give me your wallet," said Rich. Perry rolled down the window and tried to give her his wallet and Atkins screams again. "I don't want your wallet, I want her wallet," said Rich to the jurors. Finney hands her wallet to Atkins, who reaches inside the driver side window with the revolver to get the wallet. Perry tries to grab the gun and the wallet falls. He told Finney to run before the first gunshot went off and missed Perry going through the open passenger door as Finney tried to escape. During the struggle for the gun, Perry gave up and tried to slide out the passenger side of the car. The second shot struck Perry in the left arm and pierce his jugular vein and exited his right side. The third gunshot went into the driver seat and into the gas tank. "She opens the car door as he's dying and takes the wallet and flees," said Rich. Rich said Lindsay never got out the car and that Atkins did not realize that Bayou Jonas Road was a dead end street as they sped off. The two women got out of the vehicle and ran into the woods for about two miles before getting caught by Mobile County Sheriff's Office deputies. The $1900 in cash wasn't found until after the two women were booked inside metro jail. "The $1,900 dollars in cash was found in their vaginas and the revolver was found in the floorboard of the Chevy," said Rich. Defense Attorney James Vollmer had maintained the homicide was not planned. "This is not capital murder, it's felony murder," Vollmer said during opening statements. "As difficult as this may be to say, but she intended to rob someone but not to kill someone." He said audio of Atkins statements to police detectives after being arrested clearly shows that. "Once she learned of his death from detectives later that night she was horrified," said Vollmer. Most Read Get email notifications on your comments ...

Home Industry Companies Wal-Mart to face class action over alleged bribery in Mexico Wal-Mart to face class action over alleged bribery in Mexico A U.S. judge is granting class action status to Wal-Mart investors suing the world's largest retailer over allegations that it covered up a bribery scheme in Mexico. By: Associated Press | New York | Published: September 22, 2016 8:53 PM In a ruling this week, a U.S. District Judge in Fayetteville, Arkansas, dismissed Wal-Mart’s argument that the City of Pontiac General Employees’ Retirement System could not lead a class action suit because it suffered no related financial losses.(Reuters) A U.S. judge is granting class action status to Wal-Mart investors suing the world’s largest retailer over allegations that it covered up a bribery scheme in Mexico. In a ruling this week, a U.S. District Judge in Fayetteville, Arkansas, dismissed Wal-Mart’s argument that the City of Pontiac General Employees’ Retirement System could not lead a class action suit because it suffered no related financial losses. Wal-Mart’s stance was based on a certain accounting method. But U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey ruled that the pension fund showed losses using another accounting method and that Wal-Mart failed to adequately explain why its accounting method is preferable. Investors said Wal-Mart knew about the bribery scheme as early as 2005, seven years before allegations were made public. Wal-Mart said Thursday it’s considering an appeal.

The allegations included that Wal-Mart's Mexican unit paid millions of dollars in bribes to speed building permits and gain other favors. In a ruling this week, U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey in Fayetteville, Arkansas, dismissed Wal-Mart's argument that a Michigan retirement fund could not lead a class-action suit because it suffered no related financial losses. Wal-Mart's stance was based on a certain accounting method. FILE - This Sept. 19, 2013, file photo, shows the sign of a Wal-Mart store in San Jose, Calif. In a ruling on Tuesday, Sept. 20, 2016, a U.S. District Judge in Fayetteville, Ark., granted class action status to Wal-Mart investors suing the world¿s largest retailer over allegations it hid a bribery scheme in Mexico. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) But Hickey ruled that the pension fund, the City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System, showed losses using another accounting method and that Wal-Mart failed to adequately explain why its accounting method was preferable. "Judicial economy and the best interests of the class members favor class certification," Hickey wrote. Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, said the company is considering its options, including an appeal. "We continue to believe that the claims here are not appropriate for certifying a class," he said. Investors said Wal-Mart knew about the bribery scheme as early as 2005, seven years before allegations were made public by The New York Times. The newspaper reported that top executives had covered up the finding of an internal investigation and didn't alert U.S. or Mexican authorities until after the paper said it was investigating the issue. In July, a federal appeals court rejected a shareholder lawsuit filed against key directors at Wal-Mart that claimed they allowed and concealed alleged bribery in the company's Mexico division. Chief Judge William Riley wrote for the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that shareholders, including the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees' Retirement System, did "not give rise to a reasonable reference" that the board of directors learned of the suspected bribery while it was being covered up and the internal investigation squashed. That upheld an Arkansas district court's dismissal. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Peter Holley September 22 Follow @peterjholley A woman who admitted to stealing from a Walmart in St. Petersburg, Fla. told a judge she is seeking a job at the retail giant. The unexpected exchange occurred in a Florida courtroom.     EUROPEAN PRESSPHOTO AGENCY/MICHAEL REYNOLDS Nearly a year and a half has passed since Shaday Bellamy was stopped by Walmart security as she left one of the retail giant’s stores in St. Petersburg, Fla. In the 22-year-old’s shopping cart, police said, store security discovered about $150 worth of “children’s baby items.” A security officer who looked at her receipt was the first to notice a discrepancy. “She had partially scanned some of the items, but there were a number of items she hadn’t paid for,” St. Petersburg Police Department spokeswoman Yolanda Fernandez said. “She was charged with shoplifting and retail theft, which is a misdemeanor.” Bellamy was never arrested, but did receive a notice to appear in court, which she failed to do, police said. Shaday Bellamy, 22, appeared before A Pinellas County judge on Saturday. (Photo courtesy of WTSP) Fast forward 17 months to Saturday, when Bellamy found herself standing in front of a judge during Operation Safe Surrender, an annual partnership between police and courts that allows people with outstanding nonviolent misdemeanor warrants to turn themselves in without being arrested, according to the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office. Most warrants are the result of traffic violations, missed court dates and code violations, officials said. “We’re trying to make the system work here, so if they show up things are going to go better than if we had to go out and arrest them,” Pinellas County Judge Henry J. “Hank” Andringa told CBS affiliate WTSP “I think it works to their benefit.” After pleading guilty, Bellamy was asked by a judge about her plans, leading to an exchange that left Andringa temporarily speechless, according to video shot by WTSP. “Do you work?” Andringa asked. “I’m looking for [work], I have an interview,” Bellamy replied. “I’m waiting for Walmart to call me back at Pinellas Park. I have an interview with them.” For six seconds, the stupefied judge said nothing while his jaw dropped and his eyes nervously scanned the courtroom like a man caught in the Twilight Zone. Andringa is a veteran judge who “is known for sometimes adding levity” to court proceedings, according to the Clearwater Bar Association. This was not one of those times. “I’m on ‘Candid Camera,’ aren’t I?” Andringa finally replied. “How do you think it’s gonna go when the background shows that you tried to take a cart full of stuff from — well — Walmart?” he continued. “A lot of times, that’d be a disqualifier,” Andringa said. “What do I know? There, I’m over it.” Reached by phone, a Walmart spokesman declined to comment on the theft or Bellamy’s pending job application. Pinellas County Sheriff’s officials said they considered Operation Safe Surrender a success. The court collected $1,113 in fees and fines, and 38 misdemeanor warrants were processed and purged from the system, including Bellamy’s, officials said. No arrests were made during the event.

Photo: Isaac Rousso The Rousso family (left to right) — Lily, Joey, Sara, and Isaac — are excited prior to Tuesday’s opening of their first restaurant, State Fair Treats, and what it means to their future. Starting out at the State Fair of Texas, Rousso once said he wanted to have something for his children to hold on to: a business and a tradition. Isaac Rousso’s cookie fries, which won the 2016 Big Tex Choice Award for Most Creative, will debut in the restaurant on October 24 — after State Fair attendees get the first bite. The restaurant, which opened Tuesday, Sept. 20, is open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., seven days a week. “These last few weeks have been filled with many crazy-amazing 24-hour days and this is really an awesome time in our lives,” said Rousso, who plans to open more locations in the next year and across the country in the future, sharing his menu which will have up to 45 items. It was during the second week of the 2015 State Fair of Texas that he was approached by Wal-Mart executives, wanting to connect and create something new and different. “The State Fair of Texas has given us an incredible foundation and grounding, and it is the platform on which we are elevating to some really great opportunities to keep the flavors of the Fair, and ourselves, going the other 341 days of the year.” Rousso, a Dallas native, is the son of Cuban immigrants, Bertha and Joseph of blessed memory, and the brother of Sarah Rich and Rebecca Wussow. He grew up at Temple Emanu-El and was a member of BBYO’s Brandeis chapter, graduating from The Alexander School and UT Austin. He and his wife Lily, a native of Miami, Florida and the daughter of part-time Dallasites Migali and Samuel Naon, are the parents of Sara and Joey, a baby and a toddler when this journey began. In a 2010 Texas Jewish Post article, Rousso said he wanted to have something for his children to hold on to: a business and a tradition. Seemingly, with his successes, he has accomplished that goal many times over. Always a big dreamer, Isaac holds on to the fact that his family came to the United States from Cuba in 1962 and all of his life his parents taught him about working hard and living the American dream. “When I think back to how we got here, this is really some kind of dream,” he said, thrilled at the opportunity to expand his brand. “More than 2 million people come through during the Fair’s 24-day run. At our first Wal-Mart location alone, which we chose because it really is in our ‘backyard,’ we’ll have the chance to see between one-and-a-half and 2 million people every year.” The State Fair Treats menu’s taste-bud teasers include hash brown bites, breakfast tacos, breakfast biscuits, French toast, nachos, chili fries, fried pickles, macaroni and cheese bites, and desserts like funnel cake fries, cannoli bites, fried Oreos and Twinkies, and the Texas bluebonnet with whipped cream and blueberry puree. Rousso oversees all but welcomes Operations Manager Jacob Hunter and General Manager Jackie Blakely to his team. Cookie fries, crinkle-cut fry-shaped cookies — crispy on the outside and a soft butter-cookie inside with chocolate chips or sprinkles, and chocolate or strawberry sauce in which to “gedunk” the sweet sticks — derived from a recommendation by Lily. That was a good recommendation, it seems, as the entry won the 2016 Big Tex Choice Award for Most Creative. This latest culinary concoction of Rousso’s will debut in the restaurant Oct. 24 — after State Fair attendees get the first bite, during the Fair’s run from Sept. 30 to Oct. 23. In the last nine years, Rousso received Big Tex Choice Award honors for his deep-fried Cuban roll, fried Pop Tart, and his smoky bacon margarita. The business, a family collaborative that began its run at the State Fair of Texas almost a decade ago with their Taste of Cuba booth, has in the years since added the Magnolia Beer Garden, Magnolia Pavilion, Magnolia Smokehouse, and most recently the Craft Beer Terrace. It’s tough not to make a Rousso-infused snack-stop no matter where you are. “We’ve made lots of friends through the years and even though, until now, we’ve only had the month of the State Fair to see people, it’s cool that the kids who were tweens when we started are now gone to college,” said Rousso. It’s not lost on him that his own children have really grown up with his business. “It’s going to be great to get to see people, we hope, a lot more often in the restaurant.” Karissa Condoianis, vice president of public relations at the State Fair of Texas, noted that the State Fair Treats concept is wholly Rousso’s and not at all owned by the Fair itself. “We are so happy for Isaac and Lily and the whole family because they embody everything State Fair of Texas. We love seeing hard work pay off and this family works really hard. “They are so humble and kind and this venture is sure to keep the spirit of the Fair always alive.” Condoianis said that Rousso has made a commitment to help support the State Fair of Texas’ Youth Scholarship Program, which, since 1992, has awarded $8.7 million to deserving students. For the Roussos, who are members of both Chabad of Plano/Collin County and Temple Shalom and who have been married for 16 years, this year is going to be a sweet 16, and a tasty year to remember!

Walmart India mulls entry into processed food retailing after FDI rules changed The Financial Express 22-09-2016 FE Bureau © image Walmart India is evaluating an entry into the retailing of processed foods taking advantage of the government’s liberalised policy of allowing 100% foreign capital in the space, Krish Iyer, president and CEO, Walmart India, said on Wednesday.  “We are currently evaluating all the policy guidelines and we do not have an ‘only food model’ anywhere. So, we need to conceptualise, evaluate and come up with a model, which takes time,” Iyer told reporters on the sidelines of the India Retail Forum. “It is not something we will jump into very quickly,” he added. The government had in June announced 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in trading of food products produced and manufactured in India. This is now permitted through retail trading including e-commerce under the approval route. The food processing sector has attracted $5.3 billion via FDI between April 2012 and December 2015. For Walmart India, food retail in the cash-and-carry business accounts for more than 65% of business, Iyer said. He also noted that resellers, particularly mom-and-pop stores, are the most important channel for Walmart. “Our e-commerce (business to business) experience has been good, and while we do not speak about the e-commerce sales, more than 50% of buying is digitally influenced,” he said. The retailer runs 20 stores in the cash-and-carry format in nine states across the country. In the next five years, it is planning to add 50 more stores, taking the total to 70 as part of an omni-channel strategy. “We continue to focus on Tier II and Tier III cities, and the opportunities here are as good as metro towns,” Iyer said, adding that availability of land is a challenge in metros. He added that the company is focusing on private labels as it fetches better margins. “At present 95% of our products sold are manufactured in India,” he said. Meanwhile, food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal told the The Wall Street Journal that British retailer Tesco had expressed its interest in running a retail food business in India. They have dabbled in selling products wholesale and are ready to enter the retail market through outlets that sell just local fresh produce and processed food, the minister said. “Retailers want to come to India as our markets and opportunities are too good,” she said in an interview. WSJ reported Kaur recently met with retailer and food processor executives in the UK, including those from Tesco, J Sainsbury and Marks & Spencer. Many said they were exploring tie-ups with Indian companies to allow them to navigate complex local regulations to open stores and set up food-processing facilities, Kaur said.

Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now Wal-Mart wants the world to know that its employees get bonuses and that stores performed so well in the second quarter, 99 percent of its U.S. stores just got one. Each quarter, both full and part time associates can earn cash bonuses based on their store's performance. $WMT pic.twitter.com/904xoCH2HL— Walmart Newsroom (@WalmartNewsroom) September 21, 2016 But it doesn’t talk as much about the quarterly payouts to another group: shareholders, in particular its largest shareholders, the Waltons. The Walton family, which together owns 51.35 percent of the world’s largest retail company founded by Sam Walton in 1962, receives a quarterly dividend of $720 million.  That’s 50 cents for each of the family’s 1.44 billion shares. On an annual basis, that's almost $3 billion.  The $720 million for a few Waltons every quarter compares with the most recent quarterly bonus of $201 million for 932,000 hourly workers nationwide. Children of Sam Walton — Alice, Jim and Rob — each own shares directly. The remaining family shares are held by Walton Enterprises, the family’s holding company. In Texas, the employee second-quarter bonus comes to an average of $237 per worker, or a total of $24.5 million paid out to 103,500 Wal-Mart employees in the state. Is this a fair comparison to make? Here’s another one:  $2.7 billion vs $20 billion Last year, Wal-Mart announced a two-year $2.7 billion investment in its employees. That will pay for investments in education, training and higher wages. As part of this program, 1.2 million Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club employees got a raise on the same day earlier this year.  Now the average full-time hourly wage is $13.38 an hour. The average part-time hourly wage will be $10.58 an hour. At the same time, Wal-Mart said it will spend $20 billion to repurchase its own shares in the market over the next two years. That’s more than seven times the increased amount planned for improving store employee training and pay. Wal-Mart has been paying bonuses since the days of founder Sam Walton. And Wal-Mart is doing better. Its employees are meeting new tests for clean, fast and friendly shopping. The company reported a better-than-expected second quarter and raised its outlook for the year. Traffic is up as customers like what they’re seeing. Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg said the company is making the employee bonus pay information public to show a trend in improved operations. The bonus represents another measure that U.S. stores, long criticized for their shopping environment, have improved. Both the number of people receiving bonuses and the total amount distributed are up in the second quarter vs. the same quarter in the last two years.

Sep 21, 2016 Bob Krummert EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 • See more New Restaurant Concepts The "opening" image shows owner Isaac Rousso (at right) with menu items from his new State Fair Treats concept inside the Plano, Texas, Walmart. State Fair Treats Advertisement Industry statistics show restaurant traffic slowing during 2016, but that’s not going to be an issue for State Fair Treats. Each day, more than 5,000 potential customers will pass by this new operation’s site at the entrance to the Plano, Texas, Walmart Supercenter.  Open since Sept. 20, it’s the first of what owner Isaac Rousso hopes will quickly become many locations for his fair food-themed chain. Rousso is used to dealing with large numbers of customers. State Fair Treats might be his first restaurant, but the multiple food concessions he runs at the Texas State Fair give him plenty of experience in high-volume foodservice operations. “During the State Fair of Texas, we have the opportunity to serve more than two million people during the fair’s 24-day run,” he says. “At our first Walmart location alone, we’ll have the chance to see 1.5-2 million people per year.”  The 45-item menu at State Fair Treats will focus on food items typically found on state fair midways. Prices range from $1.50 to $7.50. Several offerings have been invented by Rousso, a many-time winner of the Big Tex Choice Awards contests that honors creative food items — many of them deep-fried — introduced at the Texas State Fair each year. WalMart is Rousso’s landlord, not his partner in this venture. But the retail giant sought him out in hopes of interjecting some much-needed energy into its stores. Rousso expects State Fair Treats will gross about $1 million per year. He told the Dallas News he plans to have as many at 15 units open by the end of 2016.  From there, the idea is to take State Fair Treats nationwide. He just might pull it off, too. Rousso began by operating a single booth at the Texas State Fair, Taste of Cuba. He has since added four more: Magnolia Beer Garden, Magnolia Pavilion, Magnolia Smokehouse and Craft Beer Terrace. Along the way, he’s become a culinary force in the fair food community. State fairs are justifiably famous for the exotic deep-fried treats available on their midways. Dietitians grimace when they calculate the caloric values of these sugar- and fat-laden concoctions, but Texas fairgoers embrace them. Rousso hopes Walmart shoppers will, too, and will want to eat them year-round.  In high-end dining, practitioners of molecular gastronomy such as Ferran Adria and Grant Achatz employ cutting-edge culinary techniques to create amazing tastes and textures. Think of the Big Tex Choice Award as the place where entry-level molecular gastronomists debut off-the-wall items like deep-fried butter, deep-fried bubblegum, deep-fried beer and many more. New this year are deep-fried clam chowder, fried prime rib quesadill“o” and edible cola. Rousso has won this contest before. He did so again in 2016 with his Cookie Fries entry. Its official description: “The cookie fry may look like it needs ketchup, but don’t be fooled by the classic crinkle-cut appearance. Offered in traditional cookie flavors like chocolate chip or sprinkles, these sweet treats are served with your choice of the accompanying strawberry or milk chocolate sauce. Just consider it an undercover cookie in fry-form disguise.” Cookie Fries are a key menu item at State Fair Treats. So are some of Rousso’s previous  contest winners including the Deep Fried Cuba Roll and his Fried Pop Tart. This video gives you an idea of what works and what doesn’t in this contest: The State Fair Treats business model seems solid, perhaps even enviable. The concept serves food whose popularity has already been proven by millions of Texas State Fair attendees. And its expansion path is clear: stick to sites carefully chosen from the landlord’s roster of 4,600 heavily trafficked retail locations. Even the marketing is a no-brainer — 5,000 potential customers will walk by the State Fair Treats’ entrance every day without Rousso having to lift a finger. The lone potential drawback: customer eagerness to binge on wacky deep-fried foods may not be an everyday occurrence during non-fair times. But if it is, Rousso may be able to build out his chain at a pace the restaurant industry has seldom seen before. "There are many, many McDonald's that are going to be transitioning out" of Walmart stores, Rousso says. "We're going to be looking at every opportunity as they transition out, to jump in."

The program works by visiting walmart.com/grocery or the Walmart Grocery app, selecting a store that has the program and building a shopping list. Then, customers choose a time to pick up their groceries. Workers shop the list, and customers pull up to reserved parking spaces and call a number to alert workers. An employee comes out and loads the groceries into a customer's car.  Over 30,000 items are eligible for the program, including fresh produce, meats and organic groceries.  Last year, the chain launched the service at two stores in the Huntsville area, as well as stores in Colorado, Arkansas and California.

(© FlaglerLive) Walmart and other big-box stores are so used to shoplifters that they have personnel assigned to policing the problem. Shoppers, however, don’t expect to be robbed on the property of a big-box store like Walmart, in the middle of the day–as was the case with a 43-year-old Palm Coast woman Monday afternoon. The woman had just finished shopping at the Palm Coast Walmart. She rolled out her shopping cart to her car, which she’d parked on Isle One. She did what shoppers usually do: she opened the trunk of her car and began putting away the goods she’d just bought. Her purse was in the shopping cart, by the handle–where women often put their purse while shopping. Her hand was actually on the purse when a silver vehicle approached her, with what she would later describe as an adult, black woman in the front passenger seat. In a matter of instants, that woman reached out from the silver car’s window, grabbed the shopper’s purse out of the cart and the shopper’s hands, and fled. The woman saw the car drive out by Steak and Shake, then to Palm Coast Parkway, though she couldn’t tell if it was west or east. The car was a Hyundai Sonata. The thieves had stolen her Steve Madden purse with black trim, debit cards, prescriptions, and $50. The victim was crying, sitting on the inside of her open trunk, when a deputy arrived. She was especially upset about her medicines being stolen. Two witnesses gave a Flagler County Sheriff’s deputy accounts similar to those the victim gave about the incident. Deputies obtained surveillance camera from Walmart. “The video shows the incident but does not provide suspect description or vehicle registration plate,” an incident report states. The last time a robbery was reported on Walmart’s property goes back to mid-April last year, but that report turned out to be fake: A then-38-year-old woman claimed she was robbed of her book bag by two black men near the store’s west entrance. The woman, Magdaline Scott, had also reported prescriptions stolen. But as it turned out Scott had fabricated the story. She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to probation for making a false report of a crime. Recommend or share: Tweet Print More Email Share on Tumblr Questions? Corrections? Suggestions?

Have people no shame? What is wrong with people that you would do this? That poor woman! I cannot even imagine. This is why I always have my bag on me, or put it inside the car BEFORE I offload my groceries. I guess that is the New Yorker in me. Ladies, place your bag inside the car, and always watch around you. These people have no shame. *deep sigh of sadness* Reply blondee says: September 21, 2016 at 2:31 pm Ladies!!!!! Never never never leave your purse in the shopping cart! It’s an open invitation to something like this. Reply Aynne McAvoy says: September 21, 2016 at 2:38 pm I have strongly suggested to all my woman friends that when you put your purse in a cart, secure it by running the child seat belt THROUGH the handle of your purse, and lock it. That way if a thief attempts to steal your purse, they get the whole darn cart and quickly move on to someplace else. Reply Innocent Bystander. says: September 21, 2016 at 2:51 pm Snatch and grab,car break-ins and suicide seem to be the norm for the news lately in good old Palm Compton. Declare martial law immediately. Reply Anonymous says: September 21, 2016 at 3:29 pm This same bullshit happened to my mother when we moved here years ago same MO of the perp and same description of the vehicle….Walmart step your shit up you lazy fucks get your cameras in working order you should be able to see a license plate as far out as Steak ‘n Shake …fix your shit Reply BIG JOHN says: September 21, 2016 at 4:32 pm Maybe there has to be a greater police presence in that parking lot…. Reply Oh WOW says: September 21, 2016 at 4:53 pm How sick. They scope out women coming out of Walmart. This is a new low. It seems like your not safe anywhere. But I bet if a man had been with this woman she would not have been a target. Shop with your husband ladies, you just never know. I hope they find the piece of garbage. Reply Sandra says: September 21, 2016 at 5:41 pm Oh wow, husband? You have got to be kidding. What if she is single or widowed? Should she get an escort? If at all possible shop without your purse. Put your essentials in a pocket. So glad we moved out of Palm Coast. Reply Nancy N. says: September 21, 2016 at 5:47 pm Oh WOW did you just really all but blame this woman for being targeted for robbery because she had the nerve to leave the house by herself? Should she wear a burqa too? That’s what they do in Saudi Arabia where women aren’t allowed to leave the house without a male relative to accompany them. This is America. It’s the 21st Century. I’m an adult and I’ll go where I want, when I want, thank you very much. You can keep your paternalistic protectionism to yourself. Reply tulip says: September 21, 2016 at 7:18 pm When shopping, I put my purse in the child seat, then pile groceries on top of it. When I go to my car I use the rule “purse first” and that goes in the car first. Also, I don’t put my groceries in the trunk, I put them in the car itself, because it’s harder for thieves to get between two cars to rob someone. Also, I always put my keys in my pocket because, if someone steals my purse, I can still at least drive home. It Is also very discouraging that WM doesnt’ have good cameras Reply liberal says: September 21, 2016 at 7:44 pm With all the shoplifting there, the police are there constantly. Palm Coast should require Walmart to hire one police officer per shift. That might help deter these crooks if they see a cop car in the lot 24/7. Reply Geezer says: September 21, 2016 at 8:21 pm This isn’t anything new…. Needless to say: never carry too much cash, and be ready to call your credit card companies quickly in the event of theft. You’re not in Kansas anymore. Reply Percy's mother says: September 21, 2016 at 8:22 pm As a woman, I continue to be mystified as to why women are still lugging around purses when all they need is (a) cash, (b) a debit card, (c) a credit card, or (d) for some of you, an “EBT card”. Get with the times women! Stop dragging the purse around with a load of stuff in it which you don’t need to go shopping. I see women all the time having placed their huge purses in grocery carts perusing goods whilst their purses sit unattended in said carts. Then when the purse gets stolen, they sit and cry about it. Grow up women!! Take control of yourselves and your lives. You don’t need to lug a purse around all the time. Get some pockets. OR, get a small wrist band with a zip in it, which will hold the aforementioned cash, debit, credit cards. . . go online . . . these things are available. Take responsibility for the circumstances of your lives and for God’s sake, stop crying about things. Reply Wishful thinking says: September 21, 2016 at 9:37 pm We need to do like in Venezuela . No purse..no jewelry – credit card and license inside bra or slack/Jean pocket Reply Aves says: September 21, 2016 at 9:47 pm I like how “Oh WOW” assumed ladies have husbands to shop with. God forbid some of us are single or lesbian and don’t have or need men. Reply America Rinaldi says: September 21, 2016 at 11:50 pm Maybe you need a baseball bat in your car. Reply Anonymous says says: September 22, 2016 at 12:44 am How sick the same thing happing in Winn / Dixie Saturday afternoon a mother put a grocery in the trunk of the car a pocketbook in the front seat of the car she was placing the baby in the car seat ,someone jump from a van and stole a pocketbook from the front seat of the car .

Reply Anonymous says: September 22, 2016 at 1:20 am how about cameras at the actual entrance and exits…….not just half a mile up high in the sky….common sense eludes people sometimes Reply Donna Heiss says: September 22, 2016 at 7:22 am Big John, there cannot be deputies in every store parking lot all of the time. These thieves know this is a petty crime and these are desperate times. Just another day in paradise. Reply RP says: September 22, 2016 at 7:58 am Everyone should always be vigilant about theft and crime in general. That being said, this is literally the safest time to be alive EVER. Look at the crime rate of the 70’s versus the crime rate now, it’s miniscule compared to then. People are just infinitely more aware of crime now thanks to the social media and the huge number of news outlets available. Palm Compton, haha. Good one. Reply daveT says: September 22, 2016 at 9:15 am People/shoppers trust no one protect your valuables. Reply Robert says: September 22, 2016 at 10:41 am I agree with “Percy’s Mother” – stop carrying stuff that you do not need for that particular local trip. When around town, all I carry is my Driver’s License, ONE credit card and some small bills. Easier to replace a License and ONE credit card than all I own. Just a thought. Reply Born and Raised Here says: September 22, 2016 at 1:54 pm I see so many women that set themselves up for this kind of stuff. Don’t make yourself a potential victim. Reply NY TRANSPLANT says: September 22, 2016 at 4:37 pm I saw this happen to an older lady when I lived on Long Island and never forgot it. I NEVER put my purse in the shopping cart and when I’m loading my trunk the bag is either in the trunk or on me. Reply Anonymous says: September 22, 2016 at 5:11 pm Too many cops are writing tickets on Belle Terre and not looking for crime. Seems like Manfre has given direction to go after the voters that voted him OUT of office.Let us not forget Manfre claims crime is down!!!

(Erika Burch via Facebook) By  Kevin Tampone | ktampone@syracuse.com The Post-Standard Email the author Follow on Twitter on September 21, 2016 at 2:02 PM Print Email Cleveland, Texas — Photos of a man dragging his daughter by her hair through a Texas Wal-Mart are spreading across the Internet. The photos are also sparking anger and debate about proper discipline for children. Erika Burch was shopping at the store, about 45 minutes from Houston, when she saw the girl crying. Her father had wrapped her hair around the shopping cart handle as he pushed it through the Wal-Mart, according to KHOU in Houston. Burch told the station the girl was pleading with her father to stop. "Please stop! I promise I won't do it again! Please stop!" Burch said the 5-year-old said, according to the station. A photo taken from a Facebook post by Erika Burch shows a man dragging his daughter through a Wal-Mart in Texas by wrapping her hair around a shopping cart.Erika Burch via Facebook Burch took some photos and told the man to let the girl go. He told Burch to mind her own business, she said, according to KHOU. Burch's Facebook post on the incident has been shared more than 146,000 times. Plenty of commenters on the post have criticized the father for his actions, but others have argued the man should be free to discipline his child as he sees fit. "He is a sick, sick, sick animal is what he is," Burch said, according to KHOU. The Cleveland Police Department is investigating. "We are taking this pretty serious," Chief Darrel Broussard said, according to KHOU. Broussard applauded the witnesses who tried to intervene on behalf of the child. Ora Schumann, another witness, told KPRC in Houston that the man was angry because the child wasn't staying close by. Child Protective Services workers are investigating the incident as well, KPRC said. Staff members will check in on any other children in the home and determine if the man has a pattern of behavior. "I want her to know, it is not OK for anyone to grab you by the hair of your head, it is not OK for anyone to drag you by the hair on your head," Burch told KHOU.

(WBTV via AP) Amid protests in Charlotte, some people looted a Walmart after Interstate 85 was shut down early Wednesday. People also started fires along I-85 during the night, according to local media outlet WCNC. Some tractor-trailers were also looted, and the contents were removed to start two fires along the interstate. The protests were sparked after a black man was shot and killed by a Charlotte police officer on Tuesday. In the incident, 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott was shot at an apartment complex near the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, by a black police officer, identified as Brentley Vinson. They were at the complex to serve a warrant for another man, according to The Associated Press.

Walmart is using pallets to block the front entryway. Grocery carts are being used to block the parking lot. Protesters also threw rocks at police, injuring about a dozen officers, AP reported. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney told reporters on Wednesday that officers, who were searching for a suspect, saw Scott exiting a vehicle with a handgun. Officers told him to drop the gun and he got out of his car a second time while still carrying the gun. He said officers shot him because he posed a threat. Related Coverage Protests Over Charlotte Police Shooting Move to Highway “It’s time to change the narrative, because I can tell you from the facts that the story’s a little bit different as to how it’s been portrayed so far, especially through social media,” Putney said, according to AP. His comments were apparently referring to a video posted on social media of a woman claiming to be his daughter live-streaming the scene for about an hour following the shooting. “He didn’t have no gun. He wasn’t messing with nobody,” the woman said. It was unclear if she witnessed the shooting.

Photo: Bloomberg Mumbai: Wal-Mart India is evaluating policy guidelines to come up with a “food-only” retail model, after the government has allowed 100% foreign direct investment in food retail, a top company official said on Wednesday. “We are currently evaluating all the policy guidelines and we do not have an ‘only food model’ anywhere. So, we need to conceptualise, evaluate and come up with a model, which takes time,” Wal-Mart India CEO Krish Iyer told reporters on the sidelines of India Retail Forum Mumbai. “It is not something we will jump into very quickly,” he added. On government’s move to open up food retail to investment, he said all the stakeholders including retailers, consumers, and farmers will benefit from it, and it will also increase access to capital, which will promote retail enterprise. For Wal-Mart India, food retail in the cash and carry business accounts for more than 65% of business, he said. “Particularly looking at the importance of food, we do believe that we will continue to focus a lot more on food in our cash and carry stores,” Iyer said. He also noted that resellers, particularly mom-and-pop stores are the most important channel for Wal-Mart. “Our e-commerce (B2B) experience has been good, and while we do not speak about the e-commerce sales, more than 50% of buying is digitally influenced,” he said. Iyer further said that Wal-Mart India is focusing on private labels, however, customer buying proposition is more crucial. Wal-Mart India has two private labels – Member’s Mark and Right Buy. “The idea of private labels is to support make in India programme,” he said. Wal-Mart India operates stores in nine states across the country. In the next five years, it is planning to add 50 more stores, taking the total number to 70. “We continue to focus on Tier II and Tier III cities, and the opportunities here are as good as metro towns,” Iyer said, adding that availability of land is a challenge in metros but the company continues to look for good options.

The quarterly bonuses went to workers at about 99 percent of its stores in the United States for meeting targets for sales, profit and “customer experience,” which includes cleanliness and checkout time, company spokesman Kory Lundberg said Wednesday. The payouts are part of a $2.7 billion incentive plan launched last year, when Wal-Mart also raised its minimum wage to $9 an hour. “The business plan is starting to work,” Lundberg said. “Customers are starting to notice a difference when they come into the stores to do shopping.” In all, Wal-Mart awarded about $200 million in second-quarter bonuses to 932,000 hourly store employees. Wal-Mart profits and sales for the quarter topped forecasts. Sales in the U.S. rose 3 percent, and earnings per share jumped 12 percent. The number of employees who received bonuses rose from 880,000 in the same quarter last year. As recently as two years ago, only 76 percent of stores were awarded bonuses for meeting targets, Lundberg said. Wal-Mart has about 4,600 stores and 1.5 million employees in the U.S. That includes employees outside stores, like truck drivers and distribution center workers, and employees of Sam’s Club. The bonuses were announced days after Wal-Mart said it would cut 7,000 jobs, though the company said it would try to move the workers to other stores. 40.712784 -74.005941 Related stories Good Samaritan wounded, attacker killed as mother and baby rescued at Wal-Mart Newark students receive back-to-school surprise from Walmart VIDEO: Monkey gets loose, scuffles with Wal-Mart employee in parking lot Filed in: News Topics: Wal-Mart Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Tumblr Reddit Pinterest Email Popular 2 arrested in stabbing death of 26-year-old Hofstra grad found in shallow grave in NJ Oregon man’s body dissolves in Yellowstone ‘hot pot’ death Body of Stamford man found with multiple stab wounds at Jersey Shore: sources Professor who predicted election win says Trump will be impeached Latest News Planning a big vacation?

Heather Loosemore: Content takes many forms for us because our product selection is vast. Our focus is always on value, requiring us to balance the communication of price and quality. We investigate why Wal-Mart is meaningful in their lives right now, and we build stories around that. Two stories are seasonal refreshes on a budget and keeping the kids happy and mom sane while loading groceries into her trunk. Whatever is meaningful in her life, [whatever] makes her life easier, that’s what we talk to her about, and that’s the theme. eMarketer: How will Wal-Mart Canada ensure it is addressing consumer needs? Loosemore: Our insights team is constantly [analyzing] the needs of the consumers. Not just yearly, but month to month and week to week. In addition, our Wal-Mart Media Group has an incredible amount of direct shopper data. “Our insights team is constantly [analyzing] the needs of the consumers.” A lot of times content marketing programs occur and there isn’t strong research, a test-and-control or learn-and-adapt strategy behind it, and so you can never truly [understand] the value it delivered. eMarketer: How will Wal-Mart Canada utilize media across publishers and digital devices? Loosemore: We ask ourselves what efficiencies we can drive by creating more than one piece of content at a time. Content for us is native within our own properties or native to the platform that it’s delivered on. Every publisher in this market has a native content delivery solution. eMarketer: Where are Wal-Mart Canada consumers watching their media? Loosemore: We’re seeing people consuming shorter videos, Instagram stories, Vine—you’re looking at 5 to 10 seconds to tell a story. You can’t [measure] a 30-second spot against that type of content. eMarketer: How will Wal-Mart scale the brand message across devices? Loosemore: You have to use the right medium. You’re looking at high amounts of mobile usage, specifically moms [using mobile]. [Consumers] being mobile-first is huge, but TV is always going to drive mass awareness. Lastly, display and video display media are always going to push traffic. eMarketer: Does Wal-Mart Canada experiment with new platforms? Loosemore: We wait until something is really a part of the texture of our consumers’ everyday life. We’re not going to be innovators in those formats. We want to get the best prices for our customers in the stores [and reach them on devices they are accustomed to using].

Erika Burch said she took the photos in a Cleveland Walmart after noticing that he was gripping the little girl's hair to the shopping cart handle and "dragging" her as she cried, "Please stop. I promise I won't do it again. Please stop!" (Courtesy: Erika Burch) Burch, who was shopping with her husband, said she asked the man to let go of the girl's hair and was told to mind her own business. After the argument started escalating, Burch said she called police, but a sergeant told her he couldn't make an arrest without evidence of bodily injury. Burch said the sergeant told her that the Walmart shopper "has the right to discipline his children." (Courtesy: Erika Burch) "People are telling me I'm wrong for stepping up for this little girl, but you can discipline a child without dragging them by the hair on their head, especially in Walmart," Burch told KTRK. Burch's Facebook post has been shared tens of thousands of times, and after "numerous calls" the Cleveland Police Department announced on its own page that there is currently a joint investigation underway between police and Child Protective Services. Cleveland police Chief Darrel Broussard told KPRC-TV that he was "very concerned for the well-being of the child." Police would not give any updates into the investigation Tuesday evening. 30.341320 -95.085488 Related stories Video: Cyclist Gets Doored by Chicago Driver ‘It’s My Job to Save Them’ Hero Driver Pulls Children From Burning Bus Video: Carjacker Has a Gun, But Driver Has a Pressure Washer Filed in: Watercooler Topics: Caught on Camera, controversy Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email How Do You Express Yourself?

Cleveland, Texas, police told the local media that investigators are meeting with the family as part of the probe, which apparently was prompted by a social media post that went viral. “Police are concerned at this time for the children who may be in the home with the dad who appeared to have been a little aggressive at the time,” Chief Darrel Broussard told KTRK. By way of explanation of what happened, the man apparently told officers, “His three children including the 5-year-old girl, had been disruptive in the store, and that holding her by the hair was his method of disciplining her,” the Houston Chronicle reported about the Walmart hair-pulling incident that occurred on Monday evening. A good Samaritan who confronted the man in the store and brought the alleged hair-pulling incident to the attention of authorities when the dad told her to mind her own business posted pictures to her Facebook page. In her Facebook post, an outraged Erika Burch claims that a police sergeant who responded to the scene in Walmart claimed that the dad “has the right to discipline his children,” and there was no visible bodily injury (i.e., missing hair or bruises) to the little girl that would constitute child abuse.

Robert said “Do you see what that guy is doing to that little girl?” I turned around to this this pos dragging this little girl by the hair of her head!! He had her hair wrapped around the buggy dragging her! She is begging him to stop! She was saying ‘please stop,I promise I won’t do it again please stop!’ I took my phone out snapped pictures and then told him to let the little girls hair go! He told me to mind my own business! I said ‘No I’m not! Right now this little girl is my business and you need to let her hair go now!…” The post has subsequently been shared about 130,000 times as of this writing. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y5LCF2AaPrk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> “People are telling me I’m wrong for stepping up for this little girl, but you can discipline a child without dragging them by the hair on their head, especially in Walmart,” Burch Told KTRK. “I want help for that little girl so that she knows nobody is supposed to do that to her.” In the early stages of the probe, CPS investigators are looking into whether or not “a pattern of inappropriate discipline” is taking place in the family, the Chronicle noted. Another witness claimed the man grabbed the little girl by the hair and pulled her to the shopping cart because “he was angry because she wasn’t standing right next to the basket,” KPRC Click2 Houston reported. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/emR-H079UNo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> On the department’s Facebook page yesterday, Cleveland, Texas, police responded to the controversy. “The Cleveland Police Department has received numerous calls in regards to a child having her hair pulled last night at Cleveland Wal-Mart. We want to assure the community this case is currently being investigated by our Detective Division. CPS has been contacted per our policy and is also investigating this case. A joint investigation is currently being conducted by both agencies.” https://t.co/cxLTYopGxf — ABC 7 WWSB (@mysuncoast) September 21, 2016 CPS authorities indicated that in general, kids usually stay in the family home while child abuse investigations are pending.

Walmart handed out cash bonuses of up to $500 to almost a million workers. The quarterly bonuses went to workers at about 99% of its stores in the United States for meeting targets for sales, profit and "customer experience," which includes cleanliness and checkout time, company spokesman Kory Lundberg said Wednesday. The payouts are part of a $2.7 billion incentive plan launched last year, when Walmart also raised its minimum wage to $9 an hour. "The business plan is starting to work," Lundberg said. "Customers are starting to notice a difference when they come into the stores to do shopping." In all, Walmart (WMT) awarded about $200 million in second-quarter bonuses to 932,000 hourly store employees. Walmart profits and sales for the quarter topped forecasts. Sales in the U.S. rose 3%, and earnings per share jumped 12%. Walmart paid $200 million in cash bonuses to 932,000 hourly store employees as part of a multi-billion dollar effort to ramp up profits. Related: Walmart buying Jet.com to rival Amazon The number of employees who received bonuses rose from 880,000 in the same quarter last year. As recently as two years ago, only 76% of stores were awarded bonuses for meeting targets, Lundberg said. Walmart has about 4,600 stores and 1.5 million employees in the U.S. That includes employees outside stores, like truck drivers and distribution center workers, and employees of Sam's Club. The bonuses were announced days after Walmart said it would cut 7,000 jobs, though the company said it would try to move the workers to other stores.

In the next five years, it is planning to add 50 more stores, taking the total number to 70.  walmart AFP_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg Walmart India operates stores in nine states across the country. In the next five years, it is planning to add 50 more stores, taking the total number to 70. Mumbai : Walmart India is evaluating policy guidelines to come up with a "food-only" retail model, after the government has allowed 100 per cent foreign direct investment in food retail, a top company official said on September 21. "We are currently evaluating all the policy guidelines and we do not have an 'only food model' anywhere. So, we need to conceptualise, evaluate and come up with a model, which takes time," Walmart India CEO Krish Iyer told reporters on the sidelines of India Retail Forum here. "It is not something we will jump into very quickly," he added. On government's move to open up food retail to investment, he said all the stakeholders including retailers, consumers, and farmers will benefit from it, and it will also increase access to capital, which will promote retail enterprise. For Walmart India, food retail in the cash and carry business accounts for more than 65 per cent of business, he said. "Particularly looking at the importance of food, we do believe that we will continue to focus a lot more on food in our cash and carry stores," Iyer said. He also noted that resellers, particularly mom-and-pop stores are the most important channel for Walmart. "Our e-commerce (B2B) experience has been good, and while we do not speak about the e-commerce sales, more than 50 per cent of buying is digitally influenced," he said. Iyer further said that Walmart India is focusing on private labels, however, customer buying proposition is more crucial. Walmart India has two private labels Member's Mark and Right Buy. "The idea of private labels is to support make in India programme," he said. Walmart India operates stores in nine states across the country. In the next five years, it is planning to add 50 more stores, taking the total number to 70. "We continue to focus on Tier II and Tier III cities, and the opportunities here are as good as metro towns," Iyer said, adding that availability of land is a challenge in metros but the company continues to look for good options.

The young child was crying “please stop. I promise I won’t do it again. Please stop.” The incident at a Walmart store in Cleveland, Texas, was captured on camera by alarmed shoppers Erika Burch and Robert Burch and is now being investigated by police as child endangerment. “People are telling me I’m wrong for stepping up for this little girl, but you can discipline a child without dragging them by the hair on their head, especially in Walmart,” Erika Burch told KTRK. The father can clearly be seen to pulling his daughter's hair as they shop in Cleveland, Ohio. Picture: Erika Burch / FacebookSource:Facebook Erika Burch said in a Facebook post that she and her husband were buying food for their children’s school lunches in the Walmart when her husband pointed out that a man was allegedly dragging his daughter by the hair on her head, by wrapping it around the shopping trolley. “She is begging him to stop ... ‘please stop, I promise I won’t do it again, please stop.” She claims she told the father to stop what he was doing with his daughter and he told her to “mind my own business”. “I have three little girls of my own,” Burch told the Chronicle. “I’ll be damned if I’ll ever let anybody pull them by the hair of their heads.” The little girl can clearly to be seen in pain as her father pushes the trolley with her hair wrapped around the handles.

She published the pictures on her Facebook page in the hope it would alert authorities. Cleveland Police said on its Facebook page that it had received “numerous calls” about a girl being pulled by her hair at Walmart. Cleveland Police chief Darrel Broussard told the Chronicle that police received a call about the incident about 4.45pm on Monday. The man, whom Broussard did not identify, told police that his three children including the five-year-old girl, had been disruptive in the store, and that holding her by the hair was his method of disciplining her.

September 21, 2016 at 7:06 a.m. The fate of women hangs in the balance of this election. It Trump wins, women better start looking and acting a lot more like Melania, because political correctness will be gone and terms like "broad," "wench," and the really derogatory terms will become de rigeur. Who knows, maybe the Republicans can ban birth control, which will keep some women at home with their eight children, and thus out of the work force competing with men for jobs. Who knows how bad things will get for women under a Trump presidency. At least the ones who look like supermodels will be A-OK with Trump and Republicans!

The hefty price tag shows how heavily Wal-Mart is willing to invest as it tries to boost online sales that totalled US$13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of the company’s annual revenue. While Wal-Mart and Jet.com will operate as separate brands, Wal-Mart has said it will incorporate some of Jet.com’s “smart technology” that lowers prices in real time by looking for ways to cut costs. As part of the deal, which was announced in early August, Jet.com co-founder and CEO Marc Lore will oversee both that site and Walmart.com, and will report to Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon. Lore will serve as executive vice president at Wal-Mart and president and CEO of Wal-Mart’s e-commerce business in the U.S. Lore brings to the role a rich e-commerce résumé as founder of Quidsi, the parent Diapers.com, which was bought by Amazon for US$500 million in 2010. As part of the stock portion of the deal, Lore received 3.55 million shares of restricted Wal-Mart common stock to be paid over five years. The exact value depends on Wal-Mart’s share price. But based on Monday’s closing price of US$72.09, the shares would have a current worth of nearly US$256 million. Jet’s pricing technology is built on an algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping, and adjusts prices based on what items are in the checkout cart as well as how far the desired products are from the shoppers’ home. So shoppers are encouraged to add more to build a more efficient cart and buy items labelled “smart cart” for more savings. Analysts say that the deal still won’t enable Wal-Mart to catch up to online leader Amazon.com in sales, but will help narrow the gap and should widen the distance between Wal-Mart and other online rivals. For Jet.com, which had been pouring money into splashy TV ads and other marketing, being owned by Wal-Mart should accelerate its path to profitability. In a Wal-Mart blog post on Monday, McMillon wrote, “Wal-Mart and Jet.com obsess about saving customers time and money. By joining forces, we’ll be better at doing both, creating seamless shopping from app to site to store.” On McMillon’s Instagram account was an image of Jet’s purple T-shirt with a note saying, “I’ve been waiting a month to put on this shirt”.

She ambled up one aisle and down another in the gigantic store, in search of the photos of notable neighborhood businesses and residents that Walmart had promised to display. [They fed the civil rights movement. Now are black-owned barbecue joints dying?] One such honoree was Alexander’s former business, the legendary Aleck’s Barbecue Heaven. It was one of six barbecue restaurants that her father had opened around town. But this one, on what was once Hunter Street and is now Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, achieved fame because the man whom the street’s name honors used to eat there regularly. King and other leaders of the civil rights movement hung out at Aleck’s, sometimes planning, sometimes just relaxing, over plates of ribs drenched in the restaurant’s famous spicy Come Back sauce. “All of the morning business was carried out at Paschal’s,” a motel and restaurant where activists met to strategize, Andrew Young, a prominent civil rights activist and former Atlanta mayor, told me. “But in the evening and late at night, you’d always stop at Aleck’s.” [A barbecue case that helped the cause of civil rights] Walmart stands more or less on the land where the tiny restaurant once operated. The photos were intended as an homage to the area — in the way, I suppose, that towns are named after American Indian tribes that have been conquered and street names reflect the types of trees that were bulldozed to create the subdivision. After asking a few employees about the photos, Alexander found a manager, who told us the marketing team had ordered them removed because they risked confusing the Walmart brand with something local. The manager said she didn’t know what happened to the photos. This booth at Aleck’s Barbecue Heaven was a tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. The boy in the photo is not identified. (From Pam Alexander) ‘You had to come by Aleck’s’ I first learned of Aleck’s in 1988, when I traveled to Atlanta to cover the Democratic National Convention for the alternative weekly Austin Chronicle in Texas. It was a tiny place, with four beat-up booths along the wall and a small black-and-white television sitting at one end of a peeling Formica counter. I swooned over the charred ribs, which had been smoked over hickory, oak and cherry woods and were served atop a slice of white sandwich bread and beneath a glorious swamp of that Come Back sauce. During my visit, one booth toward the back was surrounded by mementos and a large black-and-white photo of King — a sort of altar, in a place where he had once sat. Even in this cramped space, where seats were at a premium, no one ever tried to sit there. They knew it was reserved for King’s memory. [A booth worthy of its own memorial] With the impending opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington this month, I returned to Atlanta to see if I could find that booth. In my mind, it would be perfect for the museum: a way to illustrate the importance of eating places generally — and barbecue places and Aleck’s specifically — to black history. Now, all these years later, Alexander met me at the Walmart. I asked about the booth. She had been cryptic in our conversations. “I have more to tell you,” she had texted, finally. She revealed now that the owner of her former house, where the booth had been stored, had told her that a tree fell on it and the booth had been hauled off the property to a landfill. I was crestfallen. But I was here. So we went into the Walmart. She hadn’t been inside before; she couldn’t bring herself to revisit the site where Aleck’s had once been. Alexander grew up in Aleck’s, stirring the pot of sauce as a child. Her father was Ernest James Alexander. But most everyone knew him as Aleck — and as a go-to man. “If you were running for office, you had to come by Aleck’s,” Young said. “He knew everything about everyone. The New York Times reporter or Washington Post reporter trying to figure out what’s going on in the community, he’d go to Aleck’s.” Ernest James “Aleck” Alexander, right, works the pit at his barbecue restaurant with employee Jack Alford in an undated photo. (From Pam Alexander) Aleck grew up in Liberty, Mo., and attended Fisk University, a historically black university in Nashville. While there, he met Virginia Berry, who would become his wife. After graduating, Aleck taught English and coached football at Fort Valley State College for a couple of years, then moved with Virginia to Atlanta, where, in 1942, he opened a rib shack. About a year later, he opened a second Aleck’s, a takeout joint in a black middle-class neighborhood. In the mid-1940s, he opened his third place, the eatery that would help sustain a movement. Aleck’s Barbecue Heaven became a beloved hub of both the community and the movement. “Aleck’s was probably as responsible as much as anything for Martin Luther King’s greatest speeches,” Young said. “Whenever he had to write a speech, he’d either get some ribs or have somebody get some for him and take them to his house. ‘You can’t stop eating them, and then you can’t go to sleep,’ he said. He’d stay up all night and read and write because of those ribs.” Aleck’s stood right next to the West Hunter Street Baptist Church, where the Rev. Ralph Abernathy preached. Abernathy, who died in 1990, was King’s closest adviser and best friend. He co-founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which King led and of which Young was a member, and he became president after King was assassinated. Aleck’s “was a place where I saw many other people in the movement,” Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), who worked for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, recalled in a phone interview. [Why the African American museum’s food focus will go beyond soul ] Lewis was a co-sponsor of the bill that helped create the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opens Sept. 24. “By having a place where you can talk over a meal, there is a sense of fairness and equality and togetherness,” he said. “People that you have a meal with and break bread with and eat ribs with. . . .” He paused. “It tells a story,” he said. “It’s part of our history.” Without a trace Pam Alexander with her father, Ernest James “Aleck” Alexander. (From Pam Alexander) In 1979, Aleck suffered a stroke. Although Pam was working as a high school teacher at the time, she helped her father run the restaurant. The youngest of three daughters, Pam was the one who became most involved in Aleck’s. Aleck died in 1986. By then, the other restaurants had gone under. He left Aleck’s Barbecue Heaven to Pam. Her mother helped Pam for about five years; she died in 1996. Pam and her daughters, Tracey and Crystal, made a go of it, even opening a second outlet in the Underground Atlanta entertainment district in 1989, but they closed it about a year later. Aleck’s struggled through the ’90s. Three of the booths were removed because of the cost to recondition them, and Alexander replaced them with tables. The Martin Luther King booth, though, remained. In the late ’90s, she said, the city used eminent domain to buy Aleck’s and build a Publix supermarket. The city indicated at the time that it planned to relocate Aleck’s as part of a neighborhood revitalization plan, but Pam and the city couldn’t come to terms. She says the city demolished the building and everything in it except for some stones from the pit, some memorabilia, “Best Barbecue” plaques and the booth she had saved before the demolition began. She moved the items to the back yard of her home. The Publix went under. The Walmart replaced it. Now, at that Walmart, Pam and I stood at the far end of the parking lot, in front of some bushes. It was the exact spot where Aleck’s once operated. Under a scorching Georgia sun, in a blue print dress and flats, Pam gestured at the space, re­imagining for me what was once there. Here, a short-order grill called Limbo. Back there, the Pit O’ Hell. Upstairs, there was a live music lounge and a meeting space. Black power activist Stokely Carmichael was among those who held meetings up there. Now? No trace. The church right next to Aleck’s, the one where Abernathy once preached, didn’t fare much better. It is boarded up. ‘I can’t stop thinking about it’ Pam Alexander, former owner of Aleck’s Barbecue Heaven in Atlanta, at Walmart. ( Jim Shahin) In 2003, Pam won a seat on the City Council. She ran for re- ­election four years later and lost. She went into real estate, but it was the worst possible time. The housing crash devastated her, and she was forced to sell her house at auction. She moved. “I left the booth in the back yard under some plastic,” she said. “I intended to go back and get it. But everything got so crazy.” By now, evening was coming on and the day had turned rainy. Driving around the neighborhood, Pam pointed out the two-story red-brick home where King and his family once lived. We pulled into the driveway and, through the swishing wipers, gazed at the house. I asked if we could go to her previous home, the one where she had stored the booth. I wanted to see where it last was and hoped that maybe, just maybe, the homeowner’s story wouldn’t pan out. Maybe it would still be there. She called the homeowner. He agreed. As we approached the house, we saw a line of cream-colored stones used as a terrace on the front lawn. “Those are from the pit!” Pam exclaimed. “That’s them. I know it.” We wandered to the back yard. No booth. We stood in the rain while Pam ventured silently through time. Where, I asked, had it been? She pointed to the ground. “This is where it was,” she murmured. She started crying. “This is where it was.” We walked slowly back to the car. Pam sat in the passenger seat, trying to suppress her tears. She turned her face toward the window. Should the city have memorialized Aleck’s, turned it into a small museum? Should Pam have somehow, through her misfortune, done a better job of caring for her own history? Should government or a private entity have preserved this place to commemorate not only its civil rights role but also its role as a business empire operated, remarkably, by a black man in the 1940s, ’50s and ’60s? We drove through the rain to an old soul-food restaurant that Pam knew. She ate baked chicken, collards, dressing and peach cobbler. I had smothered pork chops, cracklin’ bread, dressing, chess pie. I asked a few more questions, but she was plainly exhausted. Besides, she had to get back home to babysit for her 3-year-old granddaughter. We had to go get her car, back at Walmart. A few days later, she text- ­messaged me. “I am going to replicate the booth,” she said. “I can’t stop thinking about it.” Shahin is an associate professor of journalism at Syracuse University.

Weld for Birmingham Where Birmingham Gets Connected Menu Skip to content Home Login About Us Local Music Issue 2017 Advertise Menu Skip to content News & Views Community Column Food & Drink Music WeldCast Cover Story September 20, 2016 Among the Ghosts of Industry Cody Owens Cody Owens is a staff reporter for Weld. Feel free to shoot an email at him... cody@weldbham.com ShareTweet SubscribeWeld for Birmingham Cody Owens Forged by the once-booming iron and steel production, what happened to the communities west of I-65 after the furnaces were laid to rest? Photo by Cody Owens. The garbage truck’s shaky hydraulic arm reached out and took hold of the trash can on the sidewalk. “Hold up real quick,” Lavarris Rice said as he hustled up a short flight of stairs, grabbed a large bag of trash and ran out to the street. He didn’t want to miss the trash pickup, because in Fairfield, residents like Rice live under a cloud of uncertainty when it comes to basic city services. The arm extended the now-empty can toward Rice like a robotic beggar gesturing for spare change. Rice tossed his trash and gave the operator a thumbs-up. Even though the operator is one of his longtime friends, Rice said, “You never know if this will be the last day they come by to pick up the trash.” Fairfield, once a bustling, thoughtfully designed company city, has now become a case study for what happens when economic and industrial giants decide it’s time to leave. In Fairfield (and elsewhere west of I-65), the jobs are gone but the spent shells of industry remain as a bitter reminder of a more prosperous place in time. Laid-off workers pass by the U.S. Steel Fairfield Works daily. Hopeful riders sit and wait on a bus — knowing that service soon could be discontinued — in front of the empty Walmart that is now collecting trash. In August 2015 U.S. Steel made the decision to end operations at its blast furnace in Fairfield, (which was actually named after the town in Connecticut, where the president of U.S. Steel lived, illustrating how closely tied the city was to the company) and laid off about 1,100 workers. To make matters worse, several months later Walmart made the announcement they would be closing their store in Fairfield, sparking a level of panic among residents and city officials who feared the consequences of losing the box store’s sales tax and what that would mean for the already struggling little city built by steel. The sudden announcement even garnered the attention of U.S. Congresswoman Terri Sewell who said in a statement, “The closing of the Walmart Supercenter in Fairfield is simply wrong for my constituents. Too many communities of color find themselves underserved and disadvantaged and closing this store will not help the situation. If we are to truly and substantively address these inequities, we must ensure that economic prosperity is a dream attainable to all who are willing to work for it. Closing this Walmart is the wrong thing to do!” Still, Walmart closed. As a result of the loss of roughly $125,000 in monthly tax revenue, the city was unable to pay its debts, leading to significant consequences: the Birmingham-Jefferson Transit Authority voted in May to end bus services to Fairfield, citing $545,000 in unpaid bills. While services were not shut off completely, they’ve have been reduced to two routes that run in the morning and evening. Like many other people in his community, Rice was forced to pivot after he was laid off. He had worked as a welder at MW Industrial Services for several years before the company shuttered and moved to Mobile. “You got to understand where we come from. The news people, they’ll cover something, but the reality if you come and stay one night, you’ll understand this place isn’t what you’ll see on TV,” Rice said about his hometown as he opened the door to a large empty worship hall at the Christ Episcopal Church. To better comprehend the struggles that arise from living in a city that was left behind by the industry it was built for, it’s important to understand the history of how the industrial communities west of I-65 came to be.   The Cradle “Pratt City was, in a lot of ways, is the cradle of Birmingham’s industrial neighborhoods. That’s where the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company (TCI)  had some of it’s production,” said Pam King, a history professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and historical preservationist. “It’s hard to conceive now because a lot of people don’t even know where it is.” Some of Birmingham’s more influential families would come out of this area due to the fact that the region’s vast mineral wealth led to the emergence of Pratt Mines (named after Daniel Pratt, a prominent Alabama industrialist) in the 1870s and the creation of regional shipping points like Pratt City. Much of this growth can be attributed to Pratt, who, as King said, grew much of his wealth on the backs of slave labor before the Civil War and before Birmingham was incorporated. “Daniel Pratt challenged the idea that slaves could not work in industry. He implemented this idea with his cotton gin that became one of the biggest in the world before the civil war. He essentially challenged the idea that the South could transition from agriculture to industry by way of slave labor,” King said. After the Civil War, Italians, French, German and Irish families settled in the area, drawn by the booming promise of industry and prosperity as other municipalities began to spring up along the mineral vein that brought the region to life. In 1907 U.S. Steel acquired TCI — reflecting a nationwide trend of industry consolidation — which lead to even more growth in and around Birmingham. “Ensley was Pratt City times 20,” King said. “It was a full-fledged municipality. It had its own city hall, fire station, all that. It’s got a big downtown. When U.S. Steel bought TCI around 1907, Ensley would grow even more…Ensley had a really thriving upper class, big mucky-mucks associated with U.S. Steel and TCI. In the 1920s, U.S. Steel built both Belview Heights and Bush Hills for its professional class and you can see that reflected in the homes that were built there.” Further to the west, Bessemer was becoming a powerful industrial center during this time. Founded in 1887 by Henry DeBardeleben, the son-in-law of Pratt who inherited most of his investments after the magnate’s death in 1873, Bessemer quickly established itself as a powerful presence in the region. “DeBardeleben believed, without question, that Bessemer would rival and over take Birmingham,” King said. “And really there was no reason for them not to believe that at the time. Birmingham was just a little hole in the road.” But in 1910, Birmingham annexed surrounding suburbs like Pratt City, Ensley, North Birmingham and Woodlawn, cementing its place as the main economic power in the region. As a result, Bessemer would forever be resigned to living in the shadow of Birmingham’s industrial prominence. “Ensley went kicking and screaming because they were as proud as Birmingham and they were really offended about becoming subordinate,” King said, adding that she believes this was one of the most significant turning points in Birmingham’s industrial history. According to bhamwiki.com: “Residents of Ensley held a mock funeral for their ‘dead’ city and laid a tombstone which sat for two years outside the real estate office of J. R. Perkins. The annexation did not slow development of the community, however, as new mills and businesses continued to sprout up.”   White Flight and Black Gentrification “You see the huge stacks out there?” King asked. She was referring to the ruins of the once bustling U.S. Steel Ensley Works that closed in 1976, which, at the height of production, employed roughly 30,000 people. “Now they’re overgrown with kudzu and weeds and brush. If you’re in Ensley and you’re downtown and you wonder what happened to this place, it’s really because U.S. Steel closed down their Ensley Works in 1976. It was already experiencing some outflow because of white flight and interstates and suburbanization. Such a huge number of families there were dependent on US Steel. The exact same thing happened in Fairfield.” King is fascinated by what she (and others) frequently refer to as “white flight” and the ways in which those population shifts have influenced Birmingham’s civic trajectory. Perhaps no region experienced such dramatic change as the communities west of I-65, like Belview Heights and Bush Hills, King said. These population shifts resulted from more than racial prejudices. While that did in fact play a role, the decline of the steel industry, coupled with the fact that suburbanization was happening at the same time, led to a period of demographic shifts in Birmingham’s outlying communities. Fountain Heights — while it is not located as far to the west — was one of the first neighborhoods to experience such sudden racial transition from white to black in the late 1940s, King said. As African-American soldiers began returning home after WWII, many of them began moving into Fountain Heights, a working-class neighborhood then largely inhabited by low-income white families. From 1949 to the mid-1960s, Fountain Heights became one of the first desegregated neighborhoods in Birmingham. “When black people started to move into their neighborhoods this led to an upswing in violence and a lot of [Ku Klux Klan] activity,” King said.  Slowly, desegregation began to take hold in the western suburbs by the late-1970s, due in part to the decline in steel production. “It makes sense because as you’re going down Bush Blvd, you have some grand houses and it would have taken African-American families some time to be able to afford those,” King said. “I still find it really interesting that African-American families would eventually gentrify Belview Heights and Bush Hills. Especially Bush Hills. It’s going to be the black middle class that is going to move into that neighborhood. I think it’s a fascinating story because it’s not one we ever talk about — black gentrification. That neighborhood has been saved by that fact after the industry collapsed.” In Bessemer, King said another major factor played a key role in shaping the city into what it is today: the emergence of Hoover. In many ways, King said, to whatever extent Hoover explodes around this time, the inverse happened to Bessemer. “What Hoover gained is at Bessemer’s loss,” she said. Jimmie Stephens. Photo by Cody Owens. Life in the “cutoff” Wooden model airplanes line the bookshelves; a golden prop plane serves as a paperweight on the cluttered desk; a photo of a child in a cockpit is leaned against a nearby lamp. “That’s my co-pilot,” Jimmie Stephens said proudly. Stephens is a lifelong resident of Bessemer who currently serves as the Jefferson County Commissioner for the area, and, obviously, he is an aviation enthusiast. While he enjoys flying his family to the beach on the weekends in the plane he has housed at the Bessemer Airport for the last 35 years, he has no intention of ever leaving the city. “It’s home,” he said. “For better or worse. “When I was growing up Bessemer was a very vibrant industrial town filled with manufacturing and mining,” Stephens said. “All of the commerce that was associated with that, there were about 50,000 people living there and major department stores downtown like Loveman’s and Pizitz. All this brought people into the city. That along with six downtown grocery stores really contributed to that vibrancy. A very affluent base resided in Bessemer.” However, over the course of his lifetime, Stephens has witnessed great changes take place in the place he fondly refers to as “the cutoff.” “The population actually shifted from the Ensley, Fairfield, Bessemer area. Hoover was created by residents from those areas,” Stephens said, echoing King’s observations. “You see the demise of the mining industry. You see Pullman Standard (a railroad car manufacturing company that ceased operations in Bessemer in the 1990’s). You see Griffin Wheel (which produced steel rail car wheels, closed in 2001 before being reopened a decade later, only to be closed again this month) going down. All these economic factors played a big part.” Stephens went to Bessemer schools when the system first became integrated, he explained. “What transpired after that was a white flight…They moved from the vibrant communities of Bessemer and went to either Hoover or Pleasant Grove to continue their education. Right or wrong, that’s a fact of what happened,” Stephens said. The cutoff has always been an economic engine because it had the necessary raw materials and the manufacturing capabilities that produced jobs. “When the jobs left, the economic opportunities left. There was the integration of the school systems, all of those combined combined to change demographics of the area,” Stephens said. “We lack those economic opportunities now.” That has led to what Stephens refers to as a lack of social stability. By his estimate, when he was a young man, 2 percent of the population used drugs — they were on the fringe. Now, he said, 30 to 40 percent of the “misguided youth” abuse drugs in the community he calls home. So how does that change? Stephens believes more investment needs to be made in education and economic opportunities, to give young people options besides the underground drug trade that has become an economic engine for certain areas. “Cities, large and small, all have a level of uncertainty,” Stephens said. “Our misguided youth, drugs, changing social mores where things are now acceptable that once were not. The only way that will change is when it becomes unacceptable. What’s happened is that people have left and all that’s left are people who want to participate in that. “Our integration in the South has been a two-edged sword. It’s done what’s intended to do. It’s raised up the black population that wants to better themselves. The young blacks I went to school with are now professional friends but they all live over the mountain. But there are so many people that did not take advantage of those opportunities, white and black. I guess the big question we have now is, how do we fix that?”   “If you see a hamburger on TV…” Birmingham City Councilor Sheila Tyson has rarely, if ever, shied away from speaking her mind, she said, flashing a wry grin as she sat behind her desk. This has led to her having somewhat of a love/hate relationship with the media. Today, she joked, she’s leaning more towards hate because of the way she believes some of her comments and her district have been characterized as of late. “If you see a hamburger on TV all day long, what’s going to happen? You’re going to want a hamburger before the day’s out,” Tyson said. “It’s the same thing as only running stories about people getting shot. You have 28,000 people in District 6. But every time you show something negative going on in West End and Titusville, all of Jefferson County and Alabama’s perception of that area is that there is nothing but dope dealers, murders, rapists, people robbing Family Dollars and snatching pocket books.” Tyson, whose district covers a large swath of the communities west of I-65, moved to West End in 1960s when she was eight years old. After her father died, Tyson’s mother decided to build a home there. When her family arrived with the moving truck, her new neighbors thought they were the moving company because, at the time, West End was a predominately white neighborhood and assumed an African-American family wouldn’t be financially able to build a house like they had. “When we pulled up and got the boxes out a lady came from across the street and said, ‘Hi, is the homeowner here?’” Tyson said. They were the first African-American family to move onto that street. Within about a year, Tyson said, most of the families on their street had moved. Named after a posh London suburb, West End was never an industrial town. It was a middle-class suburb of Birmingham. According to King, this was around the same time that suburbanization was taking hold in the United States and in Birmingham, specifically, families who had lived in communities like West End, were now heading over the mountain to places like Hoover. “Disinvestment, white flight, combined with suburbanization — whites wouldn’t have left if they didn’t have anywhere to go — that was going to be the push,” King explained. “The pull would be that essentially the federal government was subsidizing the construction of these new neighborhoods through highway support, through the [Federal Housing Administration] and all these initiatives that were put in place solely to create suburban middle class neighborhoods. The combination of white flight and suburbanization of neighborhoods was everything. “A big reason why the Barons — who used to play at Rickwood field — left to go to Hoover in the 1980s [was that] the manager at the time was saying that we can’t keep the doors open if we can’t attract white people to come to the games and there aren’t white people here anymore. That was a big reason why they moved.” For Tyson, the perception of her district that is portrayed in the media is a source of great frustration. As an advocate for community engagement and voter registration — during the interview she wore a shirt that read, “Friends of West End, Voter Registration Team” — Tyson wishes her district would get more positive press. It’s a sentiment shared by many in the communities that bear the brunt of negative headlines. Lavarris Rice. Photo by Cody Owens. Corey’s Kitchen The worship hall at Christ Episcopal Church is empty as Lavarris Rice surveys the room in which he and his colleagues feed about 60 people at the end of each month with their pop-up restaurant, Corey’s Kitchen. The name is a nod to Fairfield’s industrial past (originally the city was named Corey after one of U.S. Steel’s executives). Rice is a soft-spoken young man who said he became interested in cooking after the 2015 death of his 14-year-old cousin, Kiera’onna Rice, who was fatally shot following an argument that started on Facebook. “I used to work at the Fish Market and I would bring her home oysters and shrimp and things like that. We bonded over food a lot,” Rice recalled somberly. “After she died I was looking for a way to honor her and bring our community together. “Me and Terez (Rice’s business partner) grew up in this church. It’s kind of the heart of Fairfield,” Rice said. “We do our pop up dinner so we can connect people who come from different walks of life.” He knows plenty of people his age, who grew up in Fairfield, that skipped town when they were old enough. For Rice, it’s always been home and he wants to do what he can to change the city’s image. That image has taken several blows in recent months. “We might not have the money, but this is a great place. People here see what we’re doing. They might not have the money to come to the pop-up dinner but they’ve been really supportive of it,” Rice said. “Now, with the struggles the city has been seeing lately –—you got people that can’t afford trash pick up and it just piles up — we just want people to know there is so much good that still lives here. “Maybe someone [people] will say, ‘Hey, these guys are doing something. Maybe we can do something positive too,’” said Rice, who claims to be an optimist by nature. “I believe in this city. And if I can, after all I’ve been through, there’s no reason other people can’t believe in it too.” In a place like Fairfield, one that lives with the ghosts of industry long gone, a little optimism never hurt anyone.   A previous version of this article described the area known as “Dynamite Hill” as part of Fountain Heights. It is part of Smithfield.

I promise I won't do it again. Please stop!" as her father pulled the shopping trolley with her hair around the handle. Photo / Erika Burch / Facebook A father allegedly wrapped his 5-year-old daughter's hair around the handle of a shopping trolley and dragged her through a supermarket. The young child was crying "please stop. I promise I won't do it again. Please stop." The incident at a Walmart in Cleveland, Texas, was captured on camera by alarmed shoppers Erika and Robert Burch and is now being investigated by police as child endangerment. "People are telling me I'm wrong for stepping up for this little girl, but you can discipline a child without dragging them by the hair on their head, especially in WalMart," Erika Burch told KTRK. Erika Burch said in a Facebook post that she and her husband were buying food for their children's school lunches when her husband pointed out that a man was dragging his daughter by the hair on her head, by wrapping it around the shopping trolley. "She is begging him to stop ... 'please stop, I promise I won't do it again, please stop'." She claims she told the father to stop what he was doing with his daughter and he told her to "mind my own business". "I have three little girls of my own," Erika Burch told the Chronicle. "I'll be damned if I'll ever let anybody pull them by the hair of their heads." Erika Burch telephoned the police and an officer who was in the store told her that for there to be any investigation there had to be visible injuries. She published the pictures on her Facebook page in the hope they would alert authorities. Cleveland Police said on its Facebook page that it had received "numerous calls" about a girl being pulled by her hair at Walmart. Cleveland Police Chief Darrel Broussard told the Chronicle that police received a call about the incident about 4:45pm on Monday. The man, whom Broussard did not identify, told police that his three children including the 5-year-old girl, had been disruptive in the store, and that holding her by the hair was his method of disciplining her. - news.com.au Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Discover more Loading Loading Herald Services Book your ad Driven Photos for sale True Commercial Death Notices Public Notices Our Regional News Stories The Northern Advocate Wyn Drabble: Xmas shopping made easy Trade Me can help you with your Christmas shopping.

Between now and then, there are more than 50 new PS4 games up for release. While it is not possible to predict which titles stores will offer Black Friday deals on, it is safe to assume that there will be some PlayStation 4 sales competing for the holiday dollar. New releases are less likely to see discounted prices. However, Indy titles and recently published games with lackluster initial sales may be offered up for Black Friday and Christmas shoppers. For this reason, it makes sense to look at upcoming PS4 games if for nothing else than to have them on the holiday shopping radar. Historically, stores like Best Buy, GameStop, Walmart, Target, and even the PlayStation Store have offered Black Friday deals, and this year should be no different. With the release of the PlayStation 4 (slim) and PlayStation Pro, clearance sales on the older PS4 models are almost inevitable. Even popular PS4 games like Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End are likely to go on sale. Bargain hunters who may have missed some slightly older hit titles will have a field day finding them at sale prices. PS4 & PS4 Pro Black Friday 2016 Price Predictions #Playstation4 #PS4 #Sony #videogames #playstation #gamer #games #… pic.twitter.com/vevpmN5nyF — Scarlet Nossna (@scarletps4games) September 12, 2016 Those looking for something new are also going to be searching for possible holiday deals. Even if stores do not discount any of the new releases, it is still a good idea to have some new titles on your list for the gamer in your family, even if it is you. The next couple of months will have something in every genre to fit any mood or taste. While it is impossible to write about them all, each category has a few that are worth mentioning. A full list can be found at the end of the article. Sports The sports genre of video game has a fan base of loyal followers who expect a new game every year. As such, 2016 will see several PS4 games in this category released in the weeks leading up to Black Friday. One popular series in this genre is FIFA soccer. Electronic Arts, producers of the franchise, changed things a bit with this year’s version of the game. According to Goal, FIFA 17 will see the addition of a new story mode called “The Journey.” Players will control a character named Alex Hunter as they guide him to stardom. FIFA 17 out now on EA/Origin Access, four days before launch. https://t.co/fh963ZAQUR pic.twitter.com/NviFqXo9ZD — GameSpot (@gamespot) September 22, 2016 “This a campaign [sic] with a set plot just like EA’s Mass Effect and Dragon Age titles,” states Goal. IGN gave FIFA 17 an 8.4 rating and said, “An absorbing story mode compensates for an occasional lack of match sharpness.” FIFA 17 is due out on September 27. Another exciting PS4 sports game coming out is 100ft Robot Golf. The game is what the title says: golf played with gigantic robots. The courses are set in destructible environments like cities, and as you could imagine, the destruction will be one of the best parts of the game. Did that last shot put your ball right behind a skyscraper? No problem. Crush it. Next up on our #PSVR chop block is #100ftrobotgolf https://t.co/AEDKrInZ6g 43 days left! @100ftrobotgolf pic.twitter.com/QmvaBXAI4S — Frameloss (@Frame_loss) August 31, 2016 IGN states, “Just swing your golf club to smash even the tallest buildings out of the way — or into the way of your robot golfing buddies.” This quirky and fun sports twist is already available for pre-order on the PlayStation Store and will be released October 10. The day after Robot Golf comes out, WWE 2K17 for PlayStation 4 will hit store shelves. This franchise has a long history, and this version is looking to be the best yet. IGN describes the franchise as “the reigning and defending flagship WWE video game franchise champion” and claims the newest version will have “stunning graphics, ultra-authentic gameplay and a massive roster of WWE and NXT’s popular Superstars and Legends.” 'WWE 2K17' News, Roster: #bible #biblestudy #scripture #Christianity #Jesus #ChristianNews https://t.co/g6hHsvxejt pic.twitter.com/ilLDoCHE9o — BibleBreakthroughs (@BibleBrkthrus) September 13, 2016 WWE 2K17 comes out on October 11. Racing An offshoot of the sports genre of video game is racing. From pursuit games like the Need For Speed franchise to simulations such as Gran Turismo, racing is a favorite category for many gamers. PlayStation 4 will see its share of racing games before Black Friday 2016, one being Driveclub VR. Although Driveclub is a new property in the racing genre, it was well received when it came out in October 2014. Now, two years later, Evolution Studios is releasing the latest in the series titled, Driveclub VR. As the name suggests, the game is going to be tailored for the PlayStation VR peripheral. In fact, it is just Driveclub ported to the VR format. Even though Driveclub VR is a quasi-new title, iDigitalTimes reports that it will be selling for only $40 on release. That is $20 cheaper than most new games. Also, those who already own the Driveclub Season Pass will get an additional discount on the title. So maybe it can be called a Black Friday deal even without an official “sale.” Driveclub VR confirmed as PSVR launch title; Season Pass owners get discount on $39.99 price tag: https://t.co/clYLX2Abar pic.twitter.com/Hne2oO7ISo — Scott Craft (@iDTScottC) September 22, 2016 Both Driveclub VR and the PlayStation VR headset will be available on October 13. Another racing title coming in October is WRC 6 FIA World Rally Championship. The WRC series originated on the PS2 back in 2001 and has spawned a dozen games since then. WRC 6 will be lucky 13 for the franchise. BigTen Interactive’s newest rally racer will be more of the same as previous titles in the franchise. However, developers have listened to feedback from players and have made a few changes, according to IGN. “WRC 6 FIA World Rally Championship will include narrower roads, longer special stages, and even a brand new challenging experience with head-to-head Super Special Stages. WRC 6 also features increases graphics and audio perception for players.” These changes are “massive” for the game, which is due out sometime in October. Roleplaying Role-playing games (RPG) are practically a staple in any gamer’s library. The Final Fantasy series went far in making this true. The franchise has seen more sequels and spinoffs that any other RPG that comes to mind (97 to be exact). Just in time for Black Friday 2016, we will be seeing not one, but two Final Fantasy titles hitting the shelf. Final Fantasy XV details Shiva, Lunafreya in Weekly Jump: https://t.co/ySe1HeNzY6 pic.twitter.com/oiKNCboyEj — Nova Crystallis (@Nova_Crystallis) September 22, 2016 According to a website called The Final Fantasy, World of Final Fantasy will be released October 25 for the PS4 and the Vita. The game is typical FF fair but is said to be geared more toward a younger audience. The game’s story revolves around a pair of siblings and incorporates many familiar creatures and characters from previous Final Fantasy titles. For the more mature gamer, Square is also releasing its next proper Final Fantasy sequel a few days after Black Friday. Final Fantasy XV will be coming to PS4 and Xbox One on November 29. Like all FF games, Final Fantasy XV is not a sequel in the literal sense of the word. It will feature all new characters and an entirely unconnected storyline, but will still have some of the standard creatures, like the Chocobo, and gameplay features that make FF games familiar. Star Trek Online is an RPG based on the popular television show Star Trek and it is already available to play for free. It has all the elements that one would expect from a Star Trek game as well as a few familiar faces. It plays much like Elder Scrolls Online or Neverwinter with players picking a class (engineer, science, or tactical officers) and progressing through the ranks. We’re excited to announce our line of Heavy Escort Carriers are warping to console shortly! https://t.co/SmmBZWf0oX pic.twitter.com/aINBr0kCIS — Star Trek Online (@trekonlinegame) September 19, 2016 Even though it is available now and is free to play, it is worth mentioning in a holiday shopping article because in-game currency can be purchased, which could make a perfect gift for players who like the game. Sometimes the stores within free-to-play games hold specials during holidays and other special events. It would not be surprising if the Star Trek Online store has some specials on in-game purchases for Black Friday. Fighting Fighting games are sparse this holiday season, especially ones with confirmed release dates. BlazBlue: Central Fiction, Brawlhalla, and Mother Russia Bleeds are all scheduled for a 2016 release, but the dates on those are still “to be announced.” One PS4 fighter that has been confirmed is Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2. Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 Beta Begins October 8, Only on #PS4 https://t.co/gEZfLo51y9 #Xenoverse2 @BandaiNamcoUS pic.twitter.com/eizA6GGUkq — PlayStationLifeStyle (@PSLifeStyle) September 16, 2016 The first Dragon Ball Xenoverse was released last year to mixed reviews. The sequel may see a price reduction because of that and because it is coming out on Black Friday, but we will have to wait and see. If you do not want to wait for November 25 to play DBX2, the beta release starts on October 8. More fighting games are due to come out in 2017 including the hotly anticipated titles Tekken 7 and Injustice 2. So fighting fans might have to wait until after Christmas to get their fix. Shooter Shooters are one of the most popular types of video games, and several PS4 games in this genre will be available for Black Friday shopping. Titanfall 2 is one of the more anxiously awaited shooters coming out soon. Electronic Arts is hoping to capitalize on the popularity of Titanfall with its upcoming sequel. TF2 will feature similar gameplay and at least one new titan called the Scorch Titan. As the name implies, players will be able to fry their opponents with fire. Titanfall 2: 6 Minutes of 'Scorch' Titan #gameplay. #gamer #gamergirl https://t.co/xOCMIYIemJ pic.twitter.com/A0IgLplvXy — rebecca Bailey (@BabyRebbecca) September 18, 2016 Titanfall 2 is set for release on October 28. The Call of Duty franchise is also seeing a new iteration, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. The game looks to continue in the CoD tradition, only this time Activision is taking it to space. Along with the new setting comes new gameplay mechanics including zero-gravity combat. As a bonus, purchasing the CoD: Infinite Warfare Legacy or Digital Deluxe Edition will score a remastered version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. The PlayStation Store has the Legacy Edition listed at $79.99, and the Deluxe Edition at $99.99. Pre-orders for both are being accepted, and the game hits brick-and-mortar stores on November 4 in case you want to put it under the Christmas tree. Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare and LEGO Dimensions on this week's episode of PS Blogcast: https://t.co/ERKIYtKfov pic.twitter.com/KrA4GSAo9M — PlayStation (@PlayStation) September 22, 2016 Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary Edition World Tour, Hitman: Episode 5, and Battlefield 1 are also all due out before Black Friday. Adventure Adventure games are a little slower paced than a lot of other genres but are still just as fun. These types of games usually require more puzzle solving, but can still have action elements involved. They rely heavily on storytelling and are often just as enjoyable to the spectator as to the player. Debatably the hottest property coming out before Christmas in the adventure category is The Last Guardian. The game follows in the footsteps of Shadow of the Colossus and Ico. The preview shown at E3 was gorgeous, and the gameplay elements seem unique while remaining reminiscent of its spiritual predecessors. PS4 Exclusive The Last Guardian Looks Gorgeous in 16 Minutes of Gameplay Footage https://t.co/oANOEwxfmc pic.twitter.com/4Q8TDsNC9b — DualShockers (@DualShockers) September 15, 2016 The game follows the adventure of a young boy and his giant creature/pet. The two of them overcome obstacles like collapsing bridges and precarious ledges by working together to find a way to proceed. The Last Guardian relies on visual storytelling because the main character speaks some strange foreign tongue, but that should not detract from the enjoyment. In fact, both Shadow and Ico had the same language element, and it only added to those games’ charm. The Last Guardian is slated for a December 6 release, so it definitely will not make any Black Friday specials, but it will still be in time for Christmas morning. Although an exact release date has not been pinned down, Telltale Games has the next edition of its Walking Dead franchise coming out in the fourth quarter of 2016. The company’s episodic adventures have done quite well, and the upcoming The Waking Dead: A New Frontier series will probably see similar results. Typically, Telltale adventures are released in “seasons” a few weeks apart. Seasons are ordinarily inexpensive individually, but it is often a better deal to get the Season Pass. Expect The Walking Dead – A New Frontier … https://t.co/yT6DxboqyJ #360 #Gaming #Handheld #News #One #PC pic.twitter.com/SOfQC6T7Qs — Gamespresso (@gamespresso) September 6, 2016 Whether shopping for yourself or a friend or family member, this holiday season seems to be shaping up quite well for PS4 games. While it is too early to know what will be on offer during Black Friday, it is nice to have a list at the ready. Even if none of the new titles go on sale at a discount, there are sure to be other Christmas specials and Black Friday deals that will save you enough money to warrant splurging on some of the upcoming PlayStation 4 games. Check out IGN‘s full list of upcoming games here.

According to Mississippi County Sheriff Keith Moore, Joseph Phillip Latamondeer, 40, of East Prairie, was taken into custody on Thursday afternoon, September 22. Sheriff Moore said Latamondeer was at his dad's home in Mississippi County when he was arrested around 4:30 p.m. The sheriff's department had to make entry and found Latamondeer hiding inside the home. He was taken to the Mississippi County Jail. Sheriff Moore said Sikeston police assisted in the arrest. On Friday, at 1:52 a.m., officers were sent to Missouri Delta Medical Center in Sikeston, Mo. to assist another agency in reference to a domestic assault. Further investigation revealed that the domestic assault began at Walmart in Sikeston. The victim said she was assaulted by her boyfriend of one month, who was identified as Joseph Phillip Latamondeer. On Wednesday, September 14, the victim said it started at Walmart in Sikeston when Latamondeer punched her in the face in the parking lot before going inside for a few items.  Afterwards, they then drove to Hardee's to get some food. While in the drive-thru she said she tried to run away because she was afraid. The victim said she went up to Hardee's and attempted to go inside but the doors were locked. There were two other vehicles in the drive-thru, so she went to the first vehicle and they told her to leave. The second vehicle allowed her to talk and climb in the back seat. As she climbed inside, Latamondeer allegedly drug her out of the vehicle by her hair and arms and threw her into his vehicle. The victim said they then drove out of Sikeston city limits and to County Road 820 in New Madrid County where his truck broke down from overheating. She said she then tried to run again but he caught her. She stated he started kicking her several times in the sides and then threw her back into the truck and drove to Mississippi County to a place called 'Rock Bottoms.' The victim said they then got on an ATV, where Latamondeer started attacking her again. After the assault, he then drove her home. The victim said that this was not the first time he assaulted her, but she could not recall exact dates or times. The officer delivering the probable cause statement said the following about the injuries: "It is clear based on his actions in the past and this new charge that he is going to continue to commit violent acts towards women without any disregard for what he is doing or the amount of pain he inflicts. Based on my 25+ year working in law enforcement this was by far the most bruising I have ever seen on a victim as a result of being assaulted." The probable cause statements indicated the victim had burns on her back and chest that looked to be from a cigarette, according to medical personnel at Missouri Delta Medical Center. The report states she also had bruising on her face, chin and neck, on her left arm, covering the entire arm above the elbow, bruising all over her back, on her buttocks, bruising on her upper left leg and knee covering almost the entire thigh, three large bruises on her right upper thigh and knee, multiple bruises on her chest and stomach area. The victim also had approximately 16 bite marks on her back, chest, arms and legs. She had 8 broken ribs, broken in multiple places. She was in kidney failure as a result of the assault, requiring dialysis, and also has a bruised heart sustained from the domestic assault, according to investigators. The victim's mother says her daughter's friend called her because she could not get inside the victim's home in East Prairie, but could hear her crying. Her mother then went inside to find her daughter crying on the edge of her bed, saying that her whole body hurt. Her mother said she could see the bruising on her face, neck, and arms. The victim recounted the events of the night, saying she was afraid to go to the hospital. The victim's father said he received a phone call from the victim's mother saying their daughter had been hurt. He arrived at the home and learned that Latamondeer had allegedly beaten her, apparently because she told him she planned on leaving the state. Latamondeer has several prior felony convictions. He now faces charges of domestic assault, first degree - serious physical injury, kidnapping, and armed criminal action. Download the KFVS News app: iPhone | Android Copyright 2016 KFVS.

By J. NOEL ESPINOZA The Brownsville Herald Rosa Zapata hopes a new amnesty would give her family the legal status to work and earn a decent living in the United States. Zapata, who agreed to be interviewed on the condition her real name would not be used, is a native of San Luis Potosi, Mexico who now lives in Cameron Park. She qualified to apply for permanent residency when Congress in 1986 granted legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants who had lived in the United States since 1982. Zapata, who came to the country illegally with her husband and three children, couldnt seek legal status then because she didnt have her birth certificate, a requirement for the application process. Zapatas dreams to become a legal resident could come true if the United States grants legal status to undocumented Mexican immigrants currently living in this country. President Bush reportedly is considering such a move. Its great because its difficult to make decent wages as an undocumented immigrant, Zapata said. I couldnt apply before, but now I already have all the papers I need. We need stability in our family. Supporters of a broad-based amnesty said its too early to tell whether Bush is sincere or its just a political ploy to entice Hispanic support. Jose Partierra, a Washington lawyer who specializes in immigration issues, questions the presidents intentions. Its wonderful, but we need to find out the details before we celebrate, Partierra said. There is a lot of Republican opposition to changes to grant a general amnesty. Partierra, however, said this is an opportunity for Bush to show that he, and not more conservative leaders, drives immigration issues in his Republican Party. It would be an embarrassment for the president if immigration proposals he supports were defeated in Congress by his own Republican Party, Partierra said. At the same, Bush talks a nice talk, but I want to see details. If an amnesty is granted, Partierra said it should be broad-based to benefit people from every country, not just Mexico. Nathan Selzer, a spokesman for Proyecto Libertad, agreed. It divides immigrants when they talk just about one group, Selzer said. There should be a general, unconditional, legalization program for all immigrants, not just simply by nationality. Selzer said there is a need to create a mechanism for people to move across the border, not just a bracero program that treats people as machines. But some people feel its bad policy to give undocumented immigrants amnesty. Paul Egan, an official for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said amnesty promotes more illegal immigration. Its not a good policy because it promotes disrespect for the law, Egan said. The last thing we want (to show) newcomers to this country (is) that respect for the law isnt important. But its very important. Its the bedrock of our system of government. Egan said the 1986 amnesty promoted more illegal immigration. He said back then leaders expected fewer than 1 million people to apply, but more than 3 million did. Now estimates range around 3 million, but actually numbers probably are 5 million to 6 million, he said. Roger Brunner, a resident of Villa del Sol in downtown Brownsville, also feels that amnesty for undocumented immigrants is wrong. The American people have enough problems to deal with this, Brunner said. We need to start taking care of the people living here before helping other people. Brunner said he doesnt have any problems with people coming to this country legally. Some observers believe the White House began to ponder the issue of granting Mexican undocumented immigrants amnesty after Bush met with Mexican President Vicente Fox earlier this year in Mexico. Fox, in a visit to Chicago this weekend, again called for a sweeping amnesty program for undocumented Mexicans living in the United States. A White House spokesman confirmed President Bush is considering granting legal status to Mexican nationals living illegally in the United States. Mexicos National Population Council reports the move could benefit up to 3 million Mexican nationals. Bush wants to send a welcoming signal, that people from Mexico, other nations, should feel welcome in the United States, presidential press secretary Ari Fleischer said. Its part of creating an orderly process to what has been a very disorderly process along the border. Art Moreno, an Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman in Harlingen, said there is no way to know how many undocumented immigrants are in the Valley who could benefit from the amnesty. Selzer agreed. We cant begin to speculate, Moreno said. We can definitely say there are hundreds, but thats a question for the State Department to respond. Moreno said about 3.5 million people benefited throughout the United States during the 1986 amnesty. Discuss Print Posted in Local News on Tuesday, July 17, 2001 12:00 am.

But when Howard isn’t concentrating on school, she said she enjoys spending time at her favorite local businesses. “I’m always at Applebee’s – always, all the time,” Howard said. “I do most of my shopping at Wal-Mart because it’s very close. I love the bowling alley because there isn’t one in Warrensburg other than the one on campus, so that’s fun to go to whenever I have spare time…and Tony’s. I always get the pecan pie there, and it’s my favorite thing ever.” Ama Adams, a sophomore studying social work, said she loves to go to Warrensburg’s fast food restaurants. “I love Orange Leaf, and then Steak ‘n Shake of course,” Adams said. “Chick-fil-A or Taco Bell would be next.” From grocery stores to beauty salons, Warrensburg has a wide variety of small businesses and chain stores for students to choose from. With restaurants, gyms and social hot spots within minutes of UCM’s main campus, Howard said she prefers to shop locally instead of driving to larger cities. “Mostly for me it’s gas prices,” Howard said. “I live in Warrensburg, so shopping anywhere in Warrensburg is a lot cheaper than driving down to Kansas City, Lee’s Summit (or) Blue Springs. I would say the farthest that I drive anywhere in Warrensburg is six minutes with traffic, so I just take the back roads and I can get there really fast.” Warrensburg has approximately 19,000 residents, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The University of Central Missouri has more than 14,000 enrolled students, according to the university’s website. With thousands of students living within the city limits and commuting from surrounding areas, UCM has an impact on the types of businesses that come to Warrensburg and the choices that business owners make in their day-to-day operations. Mark Montgomery, owner of The Zone Tattoo and Body Piercing, said UCM students have a huge impact on his small business. “Every semester I’ve got a new set of kids, so (the student population) definitely affects how our business is run,” Montgomery said. In addition to shopping at local businesses, some UCM students also work for employers in the Johnson County area. As they earn a steady paycheck and gain work experience, those students contribute to the success and prosperity of the businesses they work for. Suzanne Taylor, executive director of the Warrensburg Chamber of Commerce, said college students bring value to the chamber’s member businesses. “The impact is most certainly the accessibility of the student body and the workforce to our local employers, and the opportunity for mentorships and internship programs,” Taylor said. The city of Warrensburg, Warrensburg Main Street and the Warrensburg Chamber of Commerce are invested in the success of local businesses, and they actively support the Love What’s Local campaign on the chamber website and Facebook page. Taylor said students should continue shopping in the city that they call home. “We have a selection of retail businesses as well as small privately owned businesses,” Taylor said. “We’d rather they shop local because we ‘love what’s local.’” Jay Meldrem, general manager for Heroes Restaurant and Pub, said he is also aware of the impact college students have on his business. “When the students come back in town there are more opportunities to make money, but also the staffing and the professors, all of that seems to double the population in a very short period of time,” Meldrem said. “There’s a lot more opportunities that open up when students are in town.” As UCM students spend money and give their time to local businesses, they invest in the economic development of the entire county. Tracy Brantner, executive director of the Johnson County Economic Development Corporation, said she has seen the impact that UCM students have on the local economy. Brantner said when students shop locally, the money they pay in sales tax goes to services that make Johnson County safer and more secure. Warrensburg’s sales tax revenue spikes when students return to school. In 2015, the Missouri Department of Revenue reported an increase of 4.47 percent from the second quarter to the third quarter of the city’s fiscal year. Brantner said as millions of dollars flow into the local economy, student purchases help fund public services. “When we’re all helping to pay for roads, public safety, police department, fire, ambulance…that raises all boats and we’re able to provide better services in a way that impacts us all,” Brantner said. Brantner said when UCM students work for local businesses, they also contribute to the economic stability of the region as a whole. “I think it’s a win-win for both the businesses and the students that are attending UCM because the businesses are looking for quality employees,” Brantner said. “The talent that the students have, coupled with the businesses that are looking for talented employees…I think that strikes a win-win in the community because we do have a lot of businesses that are looking for help, and I think that there are lots of job opportunities out there in a variety of businesses for students.” Warrensburg had 618 registered businesses within city limits by August 2016, according to the Johnson County Economic Development Corporation. With a diverse population of consumers and potential employees, Taylor said small businesses and retail chains will keep coming to Warrensburg. “We have a great quality of life and we have a strong workforce,” Taylor said. “I most certainly think it makes a difference.” Posted by digitalBURG on September 22, 2016.

Published Sep 22nd, 2016 3:30 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas The price-tag Wal-Mart Stores may pay for alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act just went higher than the $858 million the retailer will have spent by the end of fiscal 2017 defending itself during the past five years. U.S. District Judge Kathy Hickey from the Western District of Arkansas recently granted class-action status for investor plaintiff City of Pontiac General Employees Retirement System that claimed the retail giant violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by not properly disclosing the investigation in required federal filings in a timely fashion. This ruling gives the case the ability to continue. Wal-Mart had previously argued for dismissal of the pension fund’s claims citing there was no related financial loss for the investor. “This was a procedural ruling that has nothing to do with the merits of the case. We continue to believe the claims here are not appropriate for class certification. We’re considering our options, including seeking an appeal,” according to a statement provided by Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove. Hickey disagreed citing in the order: ”Judicial economy and the best interests of the class members favor class certification.” She said the investors did demonstrate loss using an alternative accounting method which is acceptable to the court. Hickey certified the class period from Dec. 8, 2011 to April 20, 2012, which is the period of time between when Wal-Mart self-reported the alleged violations and the day before the news was made public by The New York Times. FCPA expert Mike Koehler, who spent 10 years as a FCPA lawyer and now teaches law at Southern Illinois University, said Wal-Mart first disclosed its FCPA scrutiny in December 2011, which was long before the April 2012 New York Times article. “Publicly-traded companies, generally speaking, have an obligation to disclose ‘material’ information. Whether Wal-Mart should have disclosed the potential FCPA issues prior to when it did, thus depends on whether the information was ‘material.’ This issue, among others, will be the focus as the cases proceeds,” Koehler told Talk Business & Politics. While many companies might fold up under an $858 million expense since fiscal 2013, Wal-Mart’s balance sheet remains strong with net free cash flow of $10.312 billion reported as of Aug. 18, 2016. Net profits for the consolidated company totaled more than $6.852 billion through the first half of this year. And while any settlement Wal-Mart might have in this lengthly FCPA probe is going to be stout, experts don’t think it will make a big dent in Wal-Mart’s growing profits. With regard to the recent class-action status ruling by Judge Hickey, Koehler said civil litigation in the aftermath of FCPA scrutiny or enforcement is a common occurrence. Koehler said claims like those made recently by the Michigan Pension Fund may only rarely get past the motion to dismiss stage. He cited another legal action against Wal-Mart and individuals officers made by other investors which was recently dismissed by the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. He agreed that the ruling this week out of Arkansas was merely a procedural ruling by the court and it doesn’t go to the substance or underlying merit of the plaintiffs’ allegations. Last year, Wal-Mart said the majority of its $126 million FCPA expenses ($121 million) went toward legal expenses for the ongoing investigations and the remaining $5 million was spent on internal compliance protocol. In the year prior, Wal-Mart also spent $121 million of the $173 million on lawyers and legal help involving the probe. So it’s responsible to think the bulk of the $858 million FCPA-related costs are directly linked to legal representation in defense of the violation claims that now span multiple counties. Koehler also has said he expects the conclusion on Wal-Mart’s FCPA probe to wind down sometime next year. Two to four years is the normal time for a typical investigation, according to Koehler. And while the Wal-Mart case is on the outer limits of that, it’s not uncommon for a complex case to last five or six years, he added. Since the FCPA investigation first became public, Wal-Mart execs have vowed to investigate the allegations and deal swiftly with any individual who might be implicated. Koehler credits Wal-Mart with doing lots of things right, namely investing heavily in its own internal compliance program to build a stronger firewall around the business. He said the types of remedial acts are viewed positively when the settlement is negotiated. Should Wal-Mart admit to violations in its future settlement with the Department of Justice, other shareholder litigation could follow.

The massive security breakdown disclosed Thursday poses new headaches for Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer as she scrambles to close a $4.8 billion sale to Verizon Communication. The breach Thursday dates back to late 2014, raising questions about the checks and balances within Yahoo — a fallen internet star that has been laying off staff to counter a steep drop in revenue during the past eight years. ___ US home sales fell in August as inventories plummet WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans retreated from home-buying in August, as a worsening inventory shortage appears to be hurting sales and pushing prices higher. Housing has been a bright spot amid weak economic growth for much of this year. Sales totals continue to recover from the Great Recession. Buyers increasingly have pristine credit. But the primary weakness in housing has been a lack of properties for sale. Sales of existing homes slipped 0.9 per cent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.33 million, the second straight monthly decline, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. ___ US claims for jobless aid slide to lowest level since July WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level since July, more evidence that U.S. workers are enjoying job security. The Labor Department said Thursday that jobless claims slid by 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 252,000. That matched the level in mid-July, which was the lowest since April. The less-volatile four-week average fell by 2,250 to 258,500. Weekly claims have come in below 300,000 for 81 straight weeks, longest such streak since 1970. The number of people collecting unemployment benefits is 2.11 million, down nearly 6 per cent from a year ago. ___ Stocks gain moderately, led by high-dividend sectors NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks posted solid gains on Thursday as investors, comfortable that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low, bought up stocks that pay big dividends. Real estate companies rose as investors looked for income, as did telecom stocks, which also typically pay higher-than-average dividends. Trading followed a pattern that has become familiar in the last several months. After hesitating or worrying that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, investors piled into high-dividend stocks following yet another Fed decision to stand pat on interest rates. ___ US average 30-year mortgage rate declines to 3.48 per cent WASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term U.S. mortgage rates edged lower this week. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the average for the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage declined to 3.48 per cent from 3.50 per cent last week. The benchmark rate is down from 3.86 per cent a year ago, and is close to its all-time low of 3.31 per cent in November 2012. The 15-year fixed mortgage rate eased to 2.76 per cent from 2.77 per cent. ___ AP Moller-Maersk splits its shipping, energy operations COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Danish conglomerate A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S is splitting its massive container shipping operations and its energy business into separate companies, in a major shakeup that follows years of declining oil prices and freight rates. The Copenhagen-based group said Thursday the transport and logistics division will include its shipping, terminal and container businesses, while the energy division will handle oil drilling and production as well as the tanker business. A.P. Moller-Maersk raised the possibility of separating its oil units from the group through joint ventures, mergers or listings. ___ Hanjin Shipping to get more funds to resolve cargo crisis SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Hanjin Shipping is set to receive as much as $100 million in additional funds to resolve the cargo crisis caused by its slide toward bankruptcy. Hanjin’s lead creditor, Korea Development Bank, said Thursday it will offer a credit line of 50 billion won ($45 million) to help the shipper unload cargo stranded offshore. The announcement comes a day after Korean Air Lines’ board approved a 60 billion won ($54 million) loan to the troubled ocean shipping line. Even with the help of the bank, it was not clear if the new funds would be enough to solve the cargo crisis. ___ Wal-Mart to face class-action over alleged bribery in Mexico NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge has granted class-action status to Wal-Mart investors suing the world’s largest retailer over allegations that it covered up a bribery scheme in Mexico to help its business there. The allegations included that Wal-Mart’s Mexican unit paid millions of dollars in bribes to speed building permits and gain other favours. “Judicial economy and the best interests of the class members favour class certification,” U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey wrote. Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, said the company is considering its options, including an appeal. ___ Lennar and WCI join to create powerhouse in Florida NEW YORK (AP) — Lennar will spend $643 million to acquire luxury homebuilder WCI Communities Inc., tying up two of the largest home construction companies in Florida as the U.S. real estate market continues to heat up. The deal, for $23.50 per share, marks a 37 per cent premium to WCI’s closing price Wednesday. It will be half in cash and half in Lennar stock. The boards of both companies have approved the deal, which must still get the nod from WCI shareholders. ___ Tesla update halts automatic steering if driver inattentive DETROIT (AP) — Tesla Motors says a software update to its Autopilot system will disable automatic steering if drivers don’t keep their hands on the wheel. The update also adds multiple features, including improved radar, better voice commands and an industry-first temperature control system that helps prevent kids and pets from overheating. Tesla started moving the update to Model X SUV and Model S sedan owners Wednesday night over the internet. Critics questioned whether the system, which was released last fall, was ready to be on the road after a driver using Autopilot was killed when his Model S sedan struck a tractor-trailer. ___ Turkish central bank cuts rate to boost slowing economy ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey’s central bank cut a key interest rate for the seventh month in a row as it tries to shore up an economy that has been shaken by a series of bombings and an attempted coup. Voicing what appeared to be increasing worries over the scale of the country’s economic slowdown, the bank cut its overnight marginal funding rate to 8.25 per cent from 8.5 per cent. That means the rate has fallen by 2.5 percentage points since March. The lower rate is intended to help banks borrow more cheaply from day to day, which could help keep the financial system running smoothly at a time of heightened uncertainty. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average gained 98.76 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 18,392.46. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 14.06 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 2,177.18. The Nasdaq composite added 44.34 points, or 0.8 per cent, to a record 5,339.52. U.S. benchmark crude rose 98 cents to close at $46.32 a barrel, while Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 82 cents to close at $47.65 a barrel. In other energy commodities, heating oil rose 2.5 cents to $1.45 a gallon, wholesale gasoline rose less than 1 cent to $1.40 a gallon and natural gas fell 7 cents to $2.99 per 1,000 cubic feet. shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Comments are closed.

The massive security breakdown disclosed Thursday poses new headaches for Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer as she scrambles to close a $4.8 billion sale to Verizon Communication. The breach Thursday dates back to late 2014, raising questions about the checks and balances within Yahoo - a fallen internet star that has been laying off staff to counter a steep drop in revenue during the past eight years. ___ US home sales fell in August as inventories plummet WASHINGTON -- Americans retreated from home-buying in August, as a worsening inventory shortage appears to be hurting sales and pushing prices higher. Housing has been a bright spot amid weak economic growth for much of this year. Sales totals continue to recover from the Great Recession. Buyers increasingly have pristine credit. But the primary weakness in housing has been a lack of properties for sale. Sales of existing homes slipped 0.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.33 million, the second straight monthly decline, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. ___ US claims for jobless aid slide to lowest level since July WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level since July, more evidence that U.S. workers are enjoying job security. The Labor Department said Thursday that jobless claims slid by 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 252,000. That matched the level in mid-July, which was the lowest since April. The less-volatile four-week average fell by 2,250 to 258,500. Weekly claims have come in below 300,000 for 81 straight weeks, longest such streak since 1970. The number of people collecting unemployment benefits is 2.11 million, down nearly 6 percent from a year ago. ___ Stocks gain moderately, led by high-dividend sectors NEW YORK -- Stocks posted solid gains on Thursday as investors, comfortable that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low, bought up stocks that pay big dividends. Real estate companies rose as investors looked for income, as did telecom stocks, which also typically pay higher-than-average dividends. Trading followed a pattern that has become familiar in the last several months. After hesitating or worrying that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, investors piled into high-dividend stocks following yet another Fed decision to stand pat on interest rates. ___ US average 30-year mortgage rate declines to 3.48 percent WASHINGTON -- Long-term U.S. mortgage rates edged lower this week. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the average for the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage declined to 3.48 percent from 3.50 percent last week. The benchmark rate is down from 3.86 percent a year ago, and is close to its all-time low of 3.31 percent in November 2012. The 15-year fixed mortgage rate eased to 2.76 percent from 2.77 percent. ___ AP Moller-Maersk splits its shipping, energy operations COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Danish conglomerate A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S is splitting its massive container shipping operations and its energy business into separate companies, in a major shakeup that follows years of declining oil prices and freight rates. The Copenhagen-based group said Thursday the transport and logistics division will include its shipping, terminal and container businesses, while the energy division will handle oil drilling and production as well as the tanker business. A.P. Moller-Maersk raised the possibility of separating its oil units from the group through joint ventures, mergers or listings. ___ Hanjin Shipping to get more funds to resolve cargo crisis SEOUL, South Korea -- Hanjin Shipping is set to receive as much as $100 million in additional funds to resolve the cargo crisis caused by its slide toward bankruptcy. Hanjin's lead creditor, Korea Development Bank, said Thursday it will offer a credit line of 50 billion won ($45 million) to help the shipper unload cargo stranded offshore. The announcement comes a day after Korean Air Lines' board approved a 60 billion won ($54 million) loan to the troubled ocean shipping line. Even with the help of the bank, it was not clear if the new funds would be enough to solve the cargo crisis. ___ Wal-Mart to face class-action over alleged bribery in Mexico NEW YORK -- A federal judge has granted class-action status to Wal-Mart investors suing the world's largest retailer over allegations that it covered up a bribery scheme in Mexico to help its business there. The allegations included that Wal-Mart's Mexican unit paid millions of dollars in bribes to speed building permits and gain other favors. "Judicial economy and the best interests of the class members favor class certification," U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey wrote. Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, said the company is considering its options, including an appeal. ___ Lennar and WCI join to create powerhouse in Florida NEW YORK -- Lennar will spend $643 million to acquire luxury homebuilder WCI Communities Inc., tying up two of the largest home construction companies in Florida as the U.S. real estate market continues to heat up.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it Shoppers check out a Tesla Model S at a Tesla showroom in Santa Monica, Calif., in 2015. A Tesla lawsuit challenges a Michigan law that ensures automakers can sell their vehicles only through franchised dealerships. (Richard Vogel/AP) September 22 AUTOMOBILE Tesla sues Michigan over dealership law Tesla sued Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) and other state officials Thursday, challenging a Michigan law that ensures automakers can sell only through independent, franchised dealerships and not directly to customers. The federal lawsuit seeks a declaratory judgment that the 2014 “anti-Tesla” law is unconstitutional and asks for an injunction to prevent its enforcement. The Michigan Department of State last week denied Tesla’s application for a dealer license to sell to consumers, citing the law, which is backed by big auto companies and their dealerships. It has not decided on Tesla’s bid to register a vehicle repair facility in the state, which is home to the Detroit Big Three carmakers. “The sole purpose for applying (the law) to a non-franchising manufacturer like Tesla is to insulate Michigan’s entrenched automobile dealers and manufacturers from competition,” Tesla said in the lawsuit. “This is not a legitimate government interest under the U.S. Constitution.” In 2014, Snyder and the GOP-controlled legislature amended state law to clarify that car companies can sell only through franchised dealers. Tesla said it was a monopolistic strike at the fledgling company, which has no traditional dealerships. — Associated Press TELECOMMUNICATIONS More safety checks set for Samsung Note 7 Samsung Electronics was ordered to carry out more safety checks of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones before they go back on sale following an unprecedented global recall after defective batteries caused some of the phones to burst into flames. Under a recall plan agreed to by the South Korean Agency for Technology and Standards, Samsung’s battery supplier will have to X-ray-test every lithium-ion battery intended for the Note 7 before the batteries are shipped, and Samsung will carry out a quality test on every battery when it arrives from the supplier. Samsung also agreed to do more for consumers who wish to ditch their Note 7s for another brand. Consumers who missed a Monday deadline to get a refund for the Note 7 smartphone now have until the end of the month to get an iPhone or similar device from the same mobile carrier in exchange for the Note 7. The Galaxy Note 7 phone went on sale in August to glowing reviews but has become Samsung’s biggest crisis in years. With consumers reporting that the high-end phones were overheating and catching fire, Samsung stopped sales Sept. 2 and recalled 2.5 million units, citing a battery manufacturing error. This week, Samsung started shipping new Note 7 phones with safe batteries in the United States, South Korea and other countries, while urging consumers to hand in their phones for replacements. — Associated Press Also in Business ● A federal judge has granted class-action status to Walmart investors suing the world’s largest retailer over allegations that it covered up a bribery scheme in Mexico to help its business there. A key allegation was that Walmart’s Mexican unit paid millions of dollars in bribes to speed building permits and gain other favors. U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey in Fayetteville, Ark., this week dismissed Walmart’s argument that a Michigan retirement fund could not lead a class action suit because it suffered no related financial losses. Walmart’s stance was based on a certain accounting method. But Hickey ruled that the pension fund showed losses, based on another accounting method. ● Americans retreated from home buying in August, with a worsening inventory shortage appearing to hurt sales and push prices higher. Sales of existing homes slipped 0.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.33 million, the second straight monthly decline, the National Association of Realtors said. Fewer sellers are coming into the market, with inventory collapsing 10.1 percent from a year ago to 2.04 million homes. Meanwhile, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stood at 3.48 percent this week, down from 3.86 percent a year ago. ● The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level since July. The Labor Department said jobless claims slid by 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 252,000. That matched the level in mid-July, which was the lowest since April. The less-volatile four-week average fell by 2,250 to 258,500. Weekly claims have come in below 300,000 for 81 straight weeks, the longest such streak since 1970. — From news services business economy true Please provide a valid email address.

The update also adds multiple features, including improved radar, better voice commands and an industry-first temperature control system that helps prevent kids and pets from overheating. Tesla started moving the update to Model X SUV and Model S sedan owners Wednesday night over the internet. Critics questioned whether the system, which was released last fall, was ready to be on the road after a driver using Autopilot was killed when his Model S sedan struck a tractor-trailer. ___ Turkish central bank cuts rate to boost slowing economy ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey's central bank cut a key interest rate for the seventh month in a row as it tries to shore up an economy that has been shaken by a series of bombings and an attempted coup. Voicing what appeared to be increasing worries over the scale of the country's economic slowdown, the bank cut its overnight marginal funding rate to 8.25 percent from 8.5 percent. That means the rate has fallen by 2.5 percentage points since March. The lower rate is intended to help banks borrow more cheaply from day to day, which could help keep the financial system running smoothly at a time of heightened uncertainty. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average gained 98.76 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,392.46. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 14.06 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,177.18. The Nasdaq composite added 44.34 points, or 0.8 percent, to a record 5,339.52.

Hansen | lhansen@mlive.com By Logan T. Hansen | lhansen@mlive.com MLive.com Follow on Twitter on September 22, 2016 at 4:51 PM, updated September 22, 2016 at 5:02 PM comments (File photo)  DEARBORN -- Suspicious items left near a Walmart Supercenter on Ford Road prompted police to call in a bomb squad Wednesday afternoon. Around 4:30 p.m., police were alerted of a package or two outside of the shopping center that appeared "menacing and threatening," according to Police Chief Ronald Haddad. The items were a pressure cooker and a piece of luggage. "They looked like it could be a potential bomb," Haddad said. "So our patrol force quickly locked off the area, evacuated people from the area to make them safe. "The FBI, state police, and our bomb team responded within the first hour, determined it was a benign drop-off." Police look to return stolen sports memorabilia after home invasion arrests The person responsible for leaving the items called the Dearborn Police Department on Thursday morning apologizing for the mishap, Haddad said. "The person was honest enough to call this morning and say, 'You know, I feel terrible about this,' and I think that's fair enough."

There’s a lot to purchase, but shopping for the season doesn’t mean you have to spend a scary amount. We’ve put together a guide of everything you should buy (and skip) in October so you can snag the sales and avoid paying full price. Buy: Jeans Historically, October has been one of the best times to buy jeans. The cold-weather staples have been on shelves since back-to-school season and retailers are now starting to discount them. The autumn deals on denim have already begun as October approaches. So far, we’ve spotted buy one, get one 50% off jean promotions at stores like Express and American Eagle Outfitters. Buy your jeans this month to expand your wardrobe without breaking the bank. Skip: Toys Halloween hasn’t even arrived yet, but you may already be thinking about the holiday shopping season — and holiday toy season. Wal-Mart has released its 2016 holiday toy list, and Toys R Us has unveiled its 2016 Hot Toy List. If you want to pay the lowest possible price for this year’s new gizmos and gadgets for your children, wait until December. Retailers usually discount toys close to Christmas. In 2015, Amazon offered sweeping toy discounts in the weeks preceding Dec. 25. So if your son or daughter is OK without having a shiny new Star Wars figurine right now, come December you might be able to give both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Buy: All things outdoor Most people head indoors when the weather cools down, but October is a good time to focus your shopping on the outdoors. We’re talking about camping gear, patio furniture, outdoor living essentials and more. Prices on outdoor products tend to be highest when demand is highest. But with summer becoming a distant memory, now is the time to act if you need new camping supplies. For example, Cabela’s is hosting a 40% off sale on camp furniture. At Lowe’s, Weber Genesis gas grills are now $100 off. Skip: Electronics Buy a tent? Sure. But you won’t want to fill your shopping cart with major electronics this month. We recommend that you hold off on picking up that new laptop, tablet or HDTV for a little while longer. The best time of the year for electronics deals, Black Friday, is just around the corner. You’ve waited this long, so keep up that discipline until the post-Thanksgiving deal blitz arrives on Nov. 25. In 2015, Black Friday was a blowout. Wal-Mart sold a 50-inch TV for $269. Best Buy took up to $125 off the iPad Air 2. Target slashed Beats headphones by over $100. Deals are expected to rival these levels again in 2016, especially for shoppers who get in line early. Buy: Halloween candy In 2015, shoppers who celebrated Halloween planned to spend a total of $2.1 billion dollars on candy alone, according to the National Retail Federation. If you’re one of these spooky celebrants, you’ll likely be looking to buy candy in bulk again this year. It’s difficult to buy Halloween candy in any month other than October. After all, you don’t want your Reese’s and Butterfingers to go bad before the trick-or-treaters arrive. We recommend waiting until the end of October to make your purchase. Retailers will be more eager to unload their stock of Halloween supplies — that means costumes and decorations, too — as the holiday draws near. Also, consider bulk candy retailers like Costco or Oriental Trading Co. to lower your average cost per unit. » MORE: What to buy every month of the year Skip: Cleaning supplies If you need a new vacuum cleaner or other floor care device, don’t act this month. If you can get by with your current model for a while longer, you can expect deep vacuum and cleaning supply sales in late November or early spring. For instance, last Black Friday, we saw big sales on major vacuum brands from stores like Target, Best Buy and Costco. The Dyson V6 stick was up to $150 off, and the Dyson Cinetic Big Ball Animal vacuum was up to $170 off. We expect similar savings this season. Shop: Columbus Day weekend sales This Oct. 10, shoppers can commemorate the day Columbus set sail by sailing straight into a weekend full of deals. Department stores in particular are known to host sales in the days leading up to Columbus Day. Last year, Macy’s offered an extra 20% off select sale items, while J.C. Penney took up to 80% off an assortment of clothing and home goods. If you can, reserve many of your non-Halloween purchases for this weekend. Bonus: National Taco Day From National Selfie Day to National Coffee Day, there’s a quasi-holiday for just about anything. Restaurants particularly like observing food-themed days, as it gives them another opportunity to drum up business. This month, the day to look out for is Oct. 4, National Taco Day. In 2015, we spotted taco-themed discounts and deals at restaurants like El Torito and On the Border in honor of National Taco Day. Expect similar food freebies again this year.

Off the Street Video Research Politics World Science Policy Tech Energy Religion Defense Sports Recent Videos Advertisement: September 23, 2016 Low Gender-Pay Complaints Are An Admission of Subpar TalentBy John Tamny "Yeah, you're a genius, everyone knows it, a goddamn genius, but that's why you failed as a head coach - that's why you'll never be a head coach ... some genius." Those were the words of head NFL coach Bill Parcells to then assistant, and at the time once-failed (with the Cleveland Browns) head coach, Bill Belechick.  During a game Belechick had suggested a defensive scheme that Parcells rejected, only for Belechick to be proven correct. Parcells' irritated reply revealed a now dated view among some football types about Belechick; that while he was in possession of a brilliant defensive mind, he didn't have the skills to run a team. Parcells' dismissal of Belechick came to mind recently with the release of a video by actress Kristen Bell in which she complained about the alleged "gender pay" gap between men and women. Much ink has subsequently been spilled about how Bell unwittingly exposed a huge profit opportunity for self-interested business owners: if in fact women are underpaid relative to their skills just because they're women, smart owners will snap them up only to reveal through success in the marketplace why women are underpaid.  Of course, that almost misses the point. While it's certainly true that discrimination in a meritocracy is expensive, the latter was proven won long ago. There are so many examples, but in 1970 a racially integrated USC Trojan football team traveled to Birmingham, AL to play the then all-while Alabama Crimson Tide. USC walked all over the Tide, and in doing so, forced a much more rapid integration of SEC football, and sports in general. Those that hire or promote based on gender or race, or who fail to do so based on same, will pay a high price for discriminating. Seemingly the bigger story about Bell's mindless video has to do with the unspoken truth that those who complain about gender-pay discrimination are unwittingly admitting that they don't rate the supposedly equal - or greater - pay that they desire in the first place. In the real world, no truly talented person would seek coerced higher pay; instead, the skilled would reveal in the marketplace just why their pay isn't high enough through performance proving just that. In short, if women really feel they're underpaid relative to their male peers, they should express this truth in the free market. A reply to the above view may well be that talented women lack the opportunities to prove their equal or greater worth. But if that's the reply, it can't be stressed enough yet again that such a retort blaming gender discrimination for supposedly slim compensation opportunities is an explicit admission of subpar talent. Indeed, what's seemingly forgotten by the gender-pay gap crowd is that many of the highest paid males in the U.S. marketplace were similarly long discriminated against before ultimately proving their naysayers wrong. What's forever been proven true in the meritocratic markets is that really good commercial ideas, and really innovative processes, are frequently met with great skepticism - as in discrimination - in the initial stages. More specifically, the talented who ultimately rate enormous pay packages alongside great wealth usually only reach that point after being dismissed and discriminated against by the existing powers that be. Low pay and low treatment is not a gender thing. Jeff Bezos founded Amazon.com back in 1994 at a time when there existed great skepticism about the commercial worth of the internet. Had the established powers of the business world taken this maverick seriously, it's a near certainty that business behemoths of the Wal-Mart variety would have quickly paid Bezos billions for his innovation; that or they would have feverishly begun copying him right away. In reality, Bezos pursued a retail empire rooted in online sales that was ignored for quite a while. Even though Wal-Mart had much greater resources at its disposal, it didn't use them to vanquish Amazon as a competitor. To this day Wal-Mart is still striving to equal or exceed Bezos on the e-commerce front; it's recent acquisition of Jet.com for $3 billion yet another admission from the big box retail giant that its early dismissal of Bezos (now one of the five richest men in the world) has proven quite costly. Not too long after Amazon entered the marketplace, now bankrupt Blockbuster Video had the opportunity to acquire Reed Hasting's struggling online DVD rental service NetFlix for a tiny fraction of its present worth. Blockbuster's dismissal of NetFlix proved costly too; so costly that Blockbuster no longer exists. And rather than sit back and wait for another competitor to compete away its DVD rental profits, NetFlix proceeded to essentially put its initial source of great profits out of business in favor of movie and television-show streaming. The late Steve Jobs introduced an Apple iPhone at a time when Palm and Blackberry were the undisputed powers in the smartphone market. The very notion of a $500+ device that lacked Blackberry's then advanced keyboard was mocked by smartphone experts, including management at then-powerful Blackberry itself. Jobs died after adding many billions to his net worth, but only after being dismissed by a company - Blackberry - whose products are presently vanishing before our eyes thanks to it ignoring a market evolution that Jobs plainly saw. Back to Belichick, readers might stop for a second and imagine what the outcry would have been had Parcells - or any other male CEO - insulted a woman or minority employee in the same way that he did Belichick. Given the hyper-litigious society in which we live Parcells would have been fired, and the New York Jets would have paid big fines for his discouraging words. What would have been missed is that the commercial present rarely predicts the future. While Parcells viewed Belichick as a career assistant, others (most notably New England Patriots owner Bob Kraft) thankfully didn't. Four Super Bowl victories later, it's increasingly said that Belechick is the greatest NFL coach ever. So rabid are sports fans that other NFL owners (and college ADs) are constantly in search of the next Belichick, or Nick Saban. Rest assured that if an individual possesses the genius of either, gender or color won't prove a barrier to employment forever. What this hopefully reminds us is that whether in sports, or the traditional world of business, the path to higher pay for the super-talented is often paved with discrimination. Almost as a rule. Figure that those who truly rate higher pay than their peers usually only do because they have ideas about how to do things that have so far not been tried, and because they haven't been, they're regularly the source of early-stage ridicule. In commerce, if you have a great idea you almost literally have to force it on people. As evidenced by his unrivaled success in the present, the formerly $25/week assistant in Bill Belichick was once underpaid. So were Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos and Reed Hastings similarly underpaid. Visionaries are discriminated against more than anyone. Applied to females, rather than decry a supposed gender wage gap rooted in discrimination, they should simply prove it as the discriminated against long have. If not, as in if they intend to produce videos or pursue legislation to air their grievances, they're merely admitting for all to see that their level of talent doesn't rate equal or greater pay to begin with.

The ruling will make it harder for Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart to brush aside a Michigan pension fund’s claims that the chain artificially inflated the value of its shares by mishandling the alleged Mexican payoffs. The suit, filed in 2012, accused Wal-Mart of bribing Mexican officials to speed up approval for the opening of new stores. The chain was accused of hiding the bribery scheme for about seven years beginning in 2005. The payoffs were made public in a 2012 New York Times article. The paper reported at the time that Wal-Mart made at least $24 million in “suspect payments” to facilitate construction of Mexican stores. “This was a procedural ruling that has nothing to do with the merits of the case,” Randy Hargrove, a Wal-Mart spokesman, said in an e-mail. “We continue to believe the claims here are not appropriate for class treatment.” In May, the company persuaded a Delaware judge to throw out claims filed by another set of shareholders accusing directors of botching the handling of the Mexican bribery scandal. Multiple Probes The world’s largest retailer has said in regulatory filings that it spent $439 million since 2012 in connection with investigations into allegations that employees paid bribes in Mexico, China, India and Brazil. Both U.S. and Mexican prosecutors have open investigations into Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB, one of the country’s largest private employers with more than 200,000 workers. Lawyers for the Michigan pension fund contend former Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Michael Duke and other board members failed to thoroughly investigate the claims even though they were put on notice in 2005. The retailer began a comprehensive probe only after the Times reported on the allegations in 2012, investors said. Wal-Mart officials are accused of filing misleading disclosures with U.S. regulators about when they learned about the bribery claims and the thoroughness of the retailer’s internal review of its Mexican operations. In her ruling on Sept. 22, U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey in Fayetteville, Arkansas, said “judicial economy and the best interests of” shareholders favor allowing the case to proceed as a class action. The case is City of Pontiac General Employees Retirement System v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., 12-cv-05162, U.S. District Court, Western District of Arkansas (Fayetteville). Copyright 2016 Bloomberg.

She lives in Dallas, Texas with her family where she enjoys reading, roller derby, and complaining about the heat. View Profile Image: Patrick Chondon/Getty Images Print An open letter to the dad caught dragging his daughter around by her hair Share Tweet Pin Share Tumble Combined comments & shares on social media Dear Walmart Dad, I knew it would only be a matter of time before I ended up looking at the pictures of you dragging your daughter by the hair through a Walmart right here in my home state of Texas. They were all over my news feed, accompanied by one-sentence notes: "Can you believe this?" or "That poor little girl!" punctuated by sad face and mad face and broken heart emojis. I didn't really want to look. But here I am, writing an open letter (something else I never thought I'd do) to a stranger because this is my job, and that involved bringing up Erika Burch's viral post where your daughter's pleading face and your impassive one feature prominently. More: Don't effing ask me 'how much my kid cost' I looked, but I didn't want to. I didn't want to gawk. I know what it's like to be gawked at by people when a parent is punishing you in public. I grew up that way, except there were no Erika Burches when I was your daughter's age. I grew up like your daughter, and it seems I grew up the way you did too (at least based on your "defense" for your actions). You see, when the media came to talk to her, she said that you told her "[You] grew up just fine, do you see any of her hair missing?" So I'm going to do something else I don't love to do and assume something. I'm going to assume that your parents did things like this. You wouldn't be the first person to justify the continuation of it by saying that because you "turned out fine," after a childhood of physical punishment like spankings. And Walmart Dad, I know it's tempting to think it. But dude, when you grow up with parents who think dragging a kid around by their hair is OK, you're really not "just fine." People are fond of saying that kids need more discipline, and maybe that's true. What they don't need is punishment, which is what maybe you got and what your daughter got and what I got. There is a difference, believe it or not. Discipline is an appropriate consequence for an inappropriate behavior. Punishment is an overreaction. It's getting even. It's wrapping your child's hair around a pushcart like you did, because she wandered too far from the cart. Or wrapping packing tape around your kid's head and marching her around town to get her to shut up when adults are talking, like my mother did. Punishment needs shame to be effective. It needs its subject to beg, like your daughter did. Like I did. It needs pain. It needs a witness or a scar. And sometimes, those scars don't show up where you think they do. More: 50 photos you're really going to want to take of your kid I know the birthright that is fury. The inability to understand why your kid can't just do the thing you tell them to do. To act right. I know how it can bubble up and make you much angrier than it ought to. The temptation of thinking that a little public humiliation — and I don't know you, but I know from experience that what a parent gets away with in public sometimes emboldens what they do in private — or private pain might be good for them. If it happened to you, maybe it was good for you. You turned out fine, after all. But that. That right there: That justification is what means we didn't turn out OK. That little voice at the back of our heads that tells us to lash out and breathes oxygen on the little indignant sparks so they flare up into rage. That's not actually normal. It's not healthy. It's a lot of things, but "just fine" ain't one of 'em. I have never done what you've done. Even in my darkest, least fine moments, my anger has never manifested itself in physical punishment enacted on my kid. And I know you've got a lot of people tugging you in every direction. Telling you you're a piece of garbage and jumping to conclusions about what you do to your kids when no one is watching. Then you've got the people defending you. They level their judgment at your little girl instead, who they are sure undoubtedly deserved what she got. On Facebook, there's a woman who called your daughter a "piece of shit," and I cringed with the same shame I did when I first saw these pictures. When I was serving my own little punishments. More: The 10 things every boy needs to hear his parents say about consent I don't want to call you names. I don't even really want to judge you, even though that's extremely difficult. I definitely don't want to relate to you (even though a part of me does), and I'll do a lot for this job but I won't defend you. So I'll just tell you this. You and me are cut from the same cloth. There are good things about us, and there are bad things too. Maybe I'm wrong and your parents never laid a hand on you. So maybe I'm more like your daughter instead. And when it comes to the shame and pain we got as "punishment" from our own parents, we're not just fine. But we can both get there if we try.

John Hatcher With assistance from the general public, Casper Police Fraud Investigators have solved a case that was featured on Crime Stoppers. Casper Police say in late July, an elderly blind female wrote a check at the east side Wal-Mart for $10.33. The check was processed and given back to her, but later it was somehow lost. Three days later, an unknown white female changed the lost check amount to $183.77, for items she had purchased at the east side Wal-Mart. The female suspect was wearing a grey tank top with Mickey Mouse on the front. Detective John Hatcher said the case went cold, because they couldn’t identify the suspect on security cameras, and so it was featured on Crime Stoppers. About an hour or two after the new Crime Stoppers case was published, detectives received calls from the public who were able to identify the suspect, and it turned out to be 40-year old Justice Ellis. When interviewed she admitted to what she did, but didn’t say how she was able to acquire the check. Hatcher says if it wasn’t for the public’s help, who knows how long, or if the case would’ve been solved. “It’s good that when we see a success story from these Crime Stoppers and especially this week, that people in the community want to see people brought to justice, so it’s a great win for Crime Stoppers.” Hatcher adds that a warrant has been issued for Ellis’ arrest. Charges are still pending. Det.

( REUTERS/Jason Miczek) Rioting and civil unrest are becoming a common occurrence in America. The city of Charlotte has been hit by a second night of violence even though authorities are desperately pleading for calm. What sparked the chaos in Charlotte was the shooting of a 43-year-old black man named Keith Lamont Scott. It appears that he was armed when he was shot, and the police officer that shot him was also black, but those facts have done little to ease the fury of the protesters. On Tuesday night, 16 police officers were injured by rioters, including one that was hit in the face by a rock. Hopefully there will be fewer casualties by the time the violence on Wednesday night is over. So far things don't look good though. The following is how USA Today is describing the violence that we have witnessed so far on Wednesday night: A second night of dramatic protests gripped this North Carolina city Wednesday night, one day after a police-involved shooting of an African-American man led to angry demonstrations, smashed windows and trucks set ablaze. Protesters beat against a police van and broke a window of the City Smoke barbecue restaurant and bar downtown. Some yelled "hands up, don't shoot." Police tossed out smoke bombs. Protesters running outside of the Omni Charlotte Hotel said someone had been shot but that could not immediately be confirmed Wednesday night. Later on it was confirmed that someone indeed was shot. In fact, local news is reporting that there was a pool of blood on the ground: At least one person was injured in the confrontation, though it wasn't immediately clear how. "They shot him," one witness told WBTV. "They tried to cover up his blood." Firefighters rushed in to pull the man to a waiting ambulance. Officers on bicycles surrounded a pool of blood on the ground and a few people threw bottles and clods of dirt at police. Of course this follows an extremely tense night of violence and chaos that made headlines all over the globe. Just hours after Keith Lamont Scott was shot, hundreds of very angry protesters descended on downtown Charlotte: Several hundred people blocked streets well after midnight, despite the use of tear gas by police in riot gear. Clouds of tear gas drifted over the crowd, and people coughed and fell back before walking toward police lines again multiple times. They held signs that said "Stop Killing Us" and "Black Lives Matter," and they chanted "No justice, no peace." One sign read: "IT WAS A BOOK." The scene was sometimes chaotic and tense, with water bottles and stones thrown at police lines, but many protesters called for peace and implored their fellow demonstrators not to act violently. In addition to 16 police officers being injured, there were reports that rioters were hurling "rocks, bottles and traffic cones off interstate overpasses." A number of vehicles were hit, and injuries were reported. This kind of mindless violence makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Those drivers had nothing to do with the shooting, but an object thrown at a vehicle from an overpass can literally kill someone. How would killing a totally innocent person bring justice for Keith Lamont Scott? Sadly, this is what happens when riots start. They all too often spin wildly out of control. <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=2133952191" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=2133952191" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement In addition to everything else, one group of protesters decided that it would be a really good idea to loot a Wal-Mart: Protesters headed to the Walmart on N. Tryon in the University area after shutting down Interstate-85 at WT Harris Blvd. early Wednesday morning following the shooting death of 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott. Officers in riot gear blocked the entry to Walmart after it was broken into. Employees could be seen sweeping up shattered glass at the front entrance. One employee told FOX 46 Charlotte some technology was stolen, including, a flat screen television and iPads. Once again, stealing televisions and iPads is not going to do anything to bring justice for Keith Lamont Scott. There are always people that see chaos as an opportunity to take advantage of others, and this is yet another example. We live in a society that is an advanced state of moral decay, and situations like this bring it to the surface. What is truly unfortunate is that it sounds like the police actually followed correct procedure in this case. According to Police Chief Kerr Putney, Keith Lamont Scott was armed and refused to drop his weapon after repeated demands to do so: Police Chief Kerr Putney said during a news conference that officers were searching for a suspect Tuesday when they saw Scott exit a vehicle with a handgun at an apartment complex on the city's northeast side. "The officers gave loud, clear verbal commands which were also heard by many of the witnesses. They were instructing the subject, once he got out of the vehicle, to drop the weapon ... Mr. Scott exited his vehicle armed with a handgun as the officers continued to yell at him to drop it." Unfortunately, we have gotten to a point where a riot is almost expected every time an African-American male is shot by police in this country. I think that Rush Limbaugh put it very well on his radio show: It's a sad observation, folks. I'm telling you, a sad, sad observation but it's an observation that I don't think I'm alone in making. It seems like rioting is almost expected now when there is a cop shooting. A cop shooting, period. Don't care about the details. It seems like it's now axiomatic that there's going to be rioting or massive public protests or threats of rioting or threats of unrest every time the cops have to draw their weapons. Without a doubt, police brutality in the United States is out of control, and this is something that I have been writing about for a very long time. But rioting, looting and violence are not going to solve anything. We desperately need to learn how to love one another, and we desperately need to come together as a nation to work on finding some solutions. Instead, America is becoming increasingly divided, and anger and frustration are rising to unprecedented levels. And if we are witnessing this much chaos now, while things are still relatively stable, what are things going to look like once economic conditions get really bad? Our society is literally coming apart at the seams, and the chaos and the violence are going to get much worse than this. We wanted to push God out of every aspect of public life, and now we are beginning to see what that looks like. Michael Snyder is the founder and publisher of End Of The American Dream.

(NYSE: WMT)'s $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com closed Monday, but the retailer's woes won't go away overnight. Bloomberg Gadfly's Shelly Banjo offered four pieces of advice for Wal-Mart that could help close the gap between its online business and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). 1. Focus On The Customer Amazon ignored its bottom line for years in favor of gaining market share. On the other hand, Wal0-Mart has focused on turning a profit, one of the reasons why it loses to Amazon in online sales. Meanwhile, Jet's entire business model of driving down costs for consumers serves as a hint that "Walmart might continue to pursue profits over pleasing customers." Banjo further suggested that Jet's business model is also similar to those of daily deals and auctions. Moreover, "jumping through hoops" such as receiving a discount for opting out of a warranty or paying by debit card to lower a retailer's cost "shouldn't be a shopper's job." Related Link: How Does Target's New $5 Billion Buyback Plan Stack Up Against Other Retailers? 2. Pounce On Amazon Part of Amazon's popularity is due to its marketplace that connect consumers with smaller merchants. However, behind the scenes, Amazon's relationship with third-party merchants is quite poor in some cases. Wal-Mart should start "luring" sellers away from Amazon and "pounce on existing seller frustration" with Amazon. Jet's business was built on the premise of selling others' brands and could help Wal-Mart in this case. 3. Focus On Neglected Categories Consumers typically don't care for brand names when it comes to home goods and decor. Wal-Mart could focus on these categories considering Amazon relies on third-party sellers to instead of building out the category on its own. 4. Take Advantage Of 'Street Cred' Simply put, Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet gives it "some short-term street cred to mount an aggressive attack on Amazon." As such, Wal-Mart needs to give Jet's CEO Marc Lore the "room and funds" to upgrade Wal-Mart's supply chain. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

White Teacher Calls Students a Bunch of Broke ‘N—rs’ Who Will Get Shot Opinion Dear Media: Please Stop Calling Violent Rioters ‘Protesters’ by Alex Griswold | 9:58 am, September 22nd, 2016   Watching coverage of the unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina last night, I was struck by a common trend in how the most violent acts were being covered. Here are the three most-shared tweets of the night, but notice what they all have in common. BREAKING | Dozens of protesters are breaking into the Walmart on North Tryon Street. @wsoctv pic.twitter.com/2b2lmwqC2g — Mark Barber (@MBarberWSOC9) September 21, 2016 BREAKING: Hornets confirm that the team store at the arena is being looted by protestors. pic.twitter.com/Q2QKfJDXaA — WSOCTV (@wsoctv) September 22, 2016 #WCCB witnessed protesters try to throw still photographer into fire in Uptown #Charlotte. https://t.co/T6i8AH5iGu #CharlotteProtest #news pic.twitter.com/t26WgIlwOh — WCCB, Charlotte’s CW (@WCCBCharlotte) September 22, 2016 Looting a Wal-Mart, destruction of property, attempted murder, all carried out by… “protesters.” There are thousands of protests in America every year, all of which manage to be nonviolent. I’ve been to quite a few of them, including entirely peaceful Black Lives Matter protests. None of them involved throwing people into a fire. Heck, none of them managed to set anything on fire. I suppose you could make a convoluted argument about how the protests were against white supremacy, and capitalism and the media are agents of white supremacy, therefore attacking those institutions are acts of “protest” or whatever. But if even violent attempted murder and destruction of property can be a “protest” so long as the motives are political, I don’t see why the same can’t be said of, say, a terrorist attack. But I’ve never seen a tweet or headline describing Osama Bin Laden as a mere “protester.” What I suspect is going on here is that reporters are attempting to stay neutral. Calling the perpetrators “looters” or “rioters” or “attackers” carries a degree of moral condemnation with it. Normally that’d be fine, but there’s also a substantial percent of the country that sympathizes with the perpetrators, or at least their motives. To appease those who sympathize broadly with the Black Lives Matter movement or similar groups, they choose to call them “protesters” instead. But this is a false neutrality. In an effort to please those of all political stripes, the media ended up misinforming their consumers. The men and women who looted that Wal-Mart and destroyed stores were not “protesters,” and if they had done so in a context divorced from politics, media outlets would have the stones to say so. The irony is that in their quest to cater to those who sympathize with Black Lives Matter, the media ends up doing the movement a disservice. To say that the worst instances of violence and rage were carried out by “protesters” — without qualification — the unmistakable impression is that looters and thieves are emblematic of the Charlotte protests as a whole. I’m sure conservatives are salivating to chalk this up to an instance of “liberal media bias,” but we’ve seen this before with the Bundy Oregon stand-off. There was a tendency there to refer to armed militants who had seized a federal building as mere “protesters.” Again, by that definition, John McClane spent his Christmas Eve clearing out Nakatomi Plaza of “protesters.” The principle remains the same no matter if it’s liberals or conservatives embracing lawlessness: criminals are criminals, and the media has a responsibility to identify them as such. >>Follow Alex Griswold (@HashtagGriswold) on Twitter This is an opinion piece.

John Kline (R-Minn.) to create “composite” multiemployer plans. These would combine features of defined benefit and defined contribution plans to shore up financially troubled multiemployer plans. Like defined-benefit plans, the composite plans would provide beneficiaries with annuities. But as with defined-contribution plans, the annuities’ value would depend on market value and plan funding requirements. Additionally, composite plan trustees would be required to adjust contribution requirements or cut benefits if a plan were not projected to be 120 percent funded within 15 years. Opponents to the composite plans say they don’t provide sufficient protection for retirees. Witnesses at today’s hearing include Randy DeFrehn, executive director of the National Coordinating Committee for Multiemployer Plans, and David Certner, legislative policy director for government affairs at AARP. The hearing starts at 9:30 a.m. in room 2175, Rayburn House Office Building. More here. Story Continued Below GOOD MORNING.

SPEAKING OF PENSIONS: The Senate Finance Committee approved, 18-8, legislation to shore up the United Mine Workers’ health and pension plans using funds from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund and the U.S. Treasury. All of the committee’s 12 Democrats voted for the bill. They were joined by six Republicans — Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Senators Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), Richard Burr (R-NC) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). Following the vote, Senators Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said they were confident of a floor vote after the election. The committee also passed unanimously a bipartisan package of pension reforms that included a proposal to allow for so-called open multiple employer plans (different from multiemployer plans, which are created through collective bargaining). The “open MEP” proposal, which the Obama administration supports, allows small employers to pool their retirement assets together in a single 401(k) plan even if they do not have a “common bond”--a requirement under current law. TODAY: ICE UNDER FIRE: The House Judiciary Committee will question U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Sarah Saldaña on the Obama Administration's immigration enforcement policies. “Members of the committee will press Director Saldaña to enforce our immigration laws and keep criminal aliens off of our streets,” Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said. The hearing is at 10 a.m. in 2237 Rayburn, and will be livestreamed here. DOL PAID SICK LEAVE RULE LEAVES OMB: The Labor Department’s paid sick leave rule for federal contractors has left the White House Office of Management and Budget. The final rule implements a 2015 executive order that required federal contractors to provide their workers with at least seven paid sick days per year. A proposed version of the rule allowed employees to use the paid six days for themselves, for a sick family member, or for absences related to sexual assault, domestic abuse, or stalking. The Labor Department estimates the rule will expand paid sick leave to 828,000 people, including 437,000 who previously had no paid sick leave option. FED SIGNALS RATE HIKE BEFORE END OF YEAR: To no one’s surprise, the Federal Reserve did not hike interest rates Wednesday. But Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen signaled that a hike is likely before the end of the year, Jon Hilsenrath and David Harrison write in the Wall Street Journal. At a press conference, Yellen said that “the case for an increase had strengthened,” and noted economic growth was picking up, with household incomes seeing solid growth and more workers rejoining the labor force. But “she is in no hurry to raise rates to cool the economy because inflation remains below the Fed’s 2% target and a growing pool of available labor is preventing wage pressures from building.” More here. FOR OUR FUTURE SUPER PAC EXPANDS: The “For Our Future” Super PAC, engineered by Tom Steyer and top officials at the AFL-CIO, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the American Federation of Teachers, and the National Education Association, is ramping up its efforts to get Hillary Clinton and other Democrats elected, Sam Stein writes for the Huffington Post. The PAC has a total budget of $55 million and recently expanded its ground operations to Missouri and North Carolina, in addition to operations in Nevada, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. The group has reached 2 million households and plans to knock on 5.3 million doors between now and Election Day. More here. WALMART DOLES OUT WORKER BONUSES: Hourly employees at the nation’s largest private employer will collect bonuses following improved customer satisfaction in Walmart stores between May and July, The Street’s Brian Sozzi reports. Roughly 900,000 eligible workers will receive an extra $200 in their paychecks, which amounts to a $200 million tab for the retailer. At its annual meeting in June, Walmart praised improved performance, according to customer reviews, in store cleanliness, service speed, and friendliness. The announcement of worker bonuses came after a wage hike for hourly Walmart employees. The raise appears to have improved the company’s bottom line. Second quarter figures show an increase in same-store sales of 1.6 percent across the board. Read more from The Street. But UFCW’s Making Change at Walmart campaign said the bonuses will be awarded only to workers who complete a “months-long” training program. CTU STRIKE LOOMS WITH VOTE THIS WEEK: Chicago Teachers Union members are casting votes on whether to strike over a two-year-old contractual dispute. The Chicago Sun-Times’ Lauren FitzPatrick reports that the results of the vote, which will continue through Friday, won’t be immediately available. CTU leaders haven’t released a date for the strike. This is the second time over the past year that union members have voted on whether to strike; in December, 88 percent voted to strike. Meanwhile, “informational picketing” continues in Chicago, with union members handing out leaflets on the contractual dispute to families before and after school. Talks of a strike boiled over last month when Chicago Public Schools released a $5.4 billion budget that assumed the union would approve a contract it previously rejected that increased wages over four years but phased out a 7 percent pension contribution that CPS had been making on the members’ behalf. Read more from the Chicago Sun-Times. REPORT: OBAMA LABOR REGS WILL COST $81 BILLION: A report out today from the Center for Manufacturing Research estimates that the Obama administration’s labor regulations will lead to more than $81 billion in compliance costs over the next decade and result in the loss of 150,000 jobs and 411 million hours of paperwork. The report estimates that the Labor Department’s silica rule will cost $25 billion; the overtime rule will cost $24 billion; the rule to require federal contractors disclose previous labor law violations will cost $3.2 billion; and OSHA’s injury and reporting rule will cost $10 billion. In addition, the report estimates the National Labor Relations Board’s newly broadened joint employer standard and rule to speed up union elections will cost $17.5 billion and that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s proposal to collect data on compensation and diversity will cost $1.9 billion. Amanda Wood, director of employment policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, told Morning Shift that the Obama administration has suggested that the regulations are simple changes to forms, definitions or reporting requirements. “From our standpoint, these figures prove that’s just not true,” she said. Read the report here. REPORT: LITTLE EVIDENCE IMMIGRATION AFFECTS EMPLOYMENT LEVELS: A new report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine shows there is “little evidence” that immigration affects American workers’ employment levels to any significant extent. The report said immigration was more likely to affect other immigrants, because newer immigration reduces the employment rate of earlier arrivals. The same went for wages -- when measured over a period of 10 years or more, the impact of immigration on the wages of American workers was “very small,” the report said. Those most likely to be affected were prior immigrants or native-born workers who have not completed high school. The report said that in 2014 the foreign-born portion of the labor force was just over 16 percent, up from 11 percent in 1995. Undocumented immigrants numbered 11.1 million, up from 5.7 million two decades earlier. Legal immigrants numbered about 800,000 per year until 2001, and have averaged just over 1 million annually since then. First-generation immigrants are more costly to governments (mostly at the state and local levels) due the costs of education, but these children end up being among “the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the U.S. population,” the report said. They contribute more in taxes than their parents, and also more than the rest of the native-born population. The full report is here. NLRB FILES BRIEF ON SUCCESSORSHIP: The National Labor Relations Board filed a brief this week in a case on successorship, i.e., when a new employer must honor the terms of an old employer’s collective bargaining agreement after buying the company or taking control of its workers. Lily Transportation Co. succeeded a company called Pumpernickel Express Inc. as the contract carrier for workers at a Toyota warehouse in Mansfield, Mass., where the employees were unionized. Lily rehired 13 of the Pumpernickel Toyota drivers, but refused to recognize the union. A month later, 19 employees signed statements declaring they did not want union representation anymore. Lily argued that because of the statements, it didn’t need to recognize the union. But the NLRB argued that its “successor bar” doctrine precludes Lily from challenging the union’s majority status for a “reasonable period of time,” or at least six months after the first bargaining session. Even if the company could challenge the union the NLRB argued, the statements it cited from employees were “both legally tainted and factually insufficient to prove actual loss of majority support.” The full brief is here.

The protest period for the Mission City Council vote that rejected the latest plan for the Gateway development has passed. The city council, by a 6-2 vote on Aug. 17, rejected the recommendation of the city’s planning commission that it approve a preliminary site plan for the Gateway project. The latest plan included residential units on top of the Walmart that dominated the east end of the more than 16-acre site. FROM OUR SPONSORS: Adding the residential units was an attempt to address some of the concerns about the Walmart building not fitting into the mixed use designation for the property. City officials said that when the city council rejects a planning commission recommendation, the developer has 30 days to challenge the decision in district court. That did not happen. Ironically, the plan that the city council approved in January of this year when Mayor Steven Schowengerdt broke a 4-4 tie would still be valid. That plan does not have the residential on top of the Walmart. The problem for the developer, though, is that the council is not likely to approve any public financing support for the plan. For the latest version, developer Tom Valenti said he would need $31 million in TIF and CID money combined. Those programs use new property and sales tax to pay part of the development cost.

By Theodore Decker The Columbus Dispatch  •  Thursday September 22, 2016 8:52 AM The BB gun that Columbus police say Tyre King carried on the night he died retails for $49.97 at Wal-Mart. The Umarex 40XP Blowback BB Pistol is kept locked behind glass in the sporting-goods section, along with other BB pistols like the Daisy Powerline 415 and the Crosman Double Down. The gun boasts a “blowback metal slide action,” a velocity of 400 feet per second, and a drop-free 20-BB magazine. Tyre, 13, was a suspect in an armed robbery last week when he ran from police in Olde Towne East and was shot and killed by Officer Bryan Mason. Police say he was shot when he pulled the 40XP from his waistband. In an interview with The Dispatch, 19-year-old Demetrius Braxton admitted that he and Tyre were part of a group that committed the earlier robbery. After Tyre’s death, Columbus police pointed out that the 40XP was almost impossible to distinguish from a real pistol. It’s hard to disagree, even when seeing one up close. The eighth-grader’s death has been cited in the ongoing debate over the feasibility of banning similar replica weapons. A councilman in faraway Baltimore, Maryland, introduced legislation Monday calling for such restrictions in his city. “The easiest way to resolve this is to get the replica guns off the streets,” he said, according to The Baltimore Sun. If only that were true. Such proposals — and there are at least two languishing in committee in the Ohio Legislature right now — are feel-good, faux remedies. It is a misguided notion that real firearms still look like the firearms of 50 or even 10 years ago. They just don’t. These days, real firearms can look incredibly fake. You can buy a Walther 9 mm handgun in purple, a Ruger 9 mm in turquoise and a Bersa Thunder .380 in pink. Guns come in woodland camouflage, desert camouflage and pink camouflage. And in the think-you’ve-seen-it-all category, budget manufacturer Hi-Point Firearms recently released a 9 mm handgun with a limited edition “hundred dollar bills” finish. Al Pacino’s character in “Scarface,” Tony Montana, would have carried one of these. Firearms manufacturers began producing many of today’s stylish guns to cater to women, who are the fastest growing sector in shooting sports, said Linda Walker, a firearms instructor and member of the Buckeye Firearms Association. Even if police never encountered these rainbow-colored guns, it is naive to think that a day-glow sticker or orange plastic tip would help officers make the split-second decisions of life and death under every conceivable condition. In the dark. On the run. Under fire. You name it. It’s just not possible. For years, police have come across real guns that have been altered to appear fake and fake guns altered to appear real. A store clerk may not flinch if a robber brandishes a neon, dollar-store squirt gun, but wrap it in black electrician’s tape and the urge to resist becomes more foolhardy than brave. “If someone points a gun at me, I am immediately forced to make a decision,” Walker said. “It’s not something I get to ponder on for the next two minutes.” At the Wal-Mart, I pondered on the 40XP for much longer than two minutes. But big questions, like those surrounding the death of a 13-year-old boy suspected of armed robbery, aren’t answered at a big box store. When I was kid, BB guns looked like the rifles they carried in the Westerns. But kids don’t watch Westerns anymore. Maybe these exact-replica BB guns, some of which are produced by actual firearms manufacturers, appeal to kids because they look like something a grown-up would use. I surprise myself by thinking of Steve Jobs when he called the iPod Touch “training wheels for the iPhone.” BB guns that look like mom’s .380 or dad’s .45. Handguns in teal and pink for the lady shooter. Or, if you’re all about the Benjamins, a handgun covered with images of scattered $100 bills. My Wal-Mart takeaway is not at all what I expected. It is an observation, not an indictment. When it comes to marketing, the gun industry gives Apple a run for its money. tdecker@dispatch.com @Theodore_Decker Favorite Print Story Advertisement • Place an ad News Video More Videos Advertisement • Place an ad Explore Columbus Search Businesses Featured Businesses Loading...

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 7:25 AM, September 22, 2016 Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N> must face a class-action lawsuit accusing the world's largest retailer of defrauding shareholders by concealing suspected bribery to help it expand faster in Mexico, a U.S. judge said. In a decision on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey in Fayetteville, Arkansas rejected Wal-Mart's contention that a Michigan pension fund had no standing to lead the case because it had not suffered losses on the retailer's stock. The decision means shareholders can sue Wal-Mart and former Chief Executive Mike Duke as a group over the alleged cover-up of bribery at Wal-Mart de Mexico. This could lead to a larger payout at lower cost than if individual lawsuits were required. Class certification "would enhance judicial economy and efficiency," given that many shareholders had small claims, and "concentrating the claims in defendants' home forum with uniform decisions is desirable," Hickey wrote. Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer believes a class action is "not appropriate," and may appeal the certification decision. The market value of Wal-Mart fell by roughly $17 billion over three days in April 2012, after The New York Times published a Pulitzer Prize-winning report saying the retailer paid bribes to Mexican officials for years to speed up store openings. Shareholders said Wal-Mart knew about the scheme as early as 2005, and downplayed it even after learning about the Times' investigation. Wal-Mart had argued that a widely-accepted accounting method prevented the lead plaintiff City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System from showing it lost money on Wal-Mart stock. But the judge said the pension fund could show losses under another widely-accepted accounting method, and that Wal-Mart failed to show why its preferred method was better. The class period runs from Dec. 8, 2011 to April 20, 2012, Hickey said. In July, a federal appeals court upheld Hickey's April 2015 dismissal of shareholder claims against Duke, his predecessor Lee Scott, and Wal-Mart' board. A Delaware state judge dismissed similar claims by other shareholders in May. Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd represents the Michigan pension fund. It did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case is City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System v. Walmart Stores Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Western District of Arkansas, No. 12-05162.

ZACK WITTMAN | Times By Alli Knothe Times Staff Writer Published: September 20, 2016 Publix Super Markets is finally installing readers for credit cards that have security chips. “We are aggressively installing chip readers in our company-wide rollout without sacrificing the positive shopping experience of our customers and associates,” Publix spokesman Brian West said Tuesday. The first chip readers were installed in July, he said. West declined to say when the readers would be on-line for all of the Lakeland-based grocer’s 1,000-plus locations. Other retailers, from Walmart and Target to independent stores like Buddy Brew Coffee installed the readers last year. In May, Publix said it was working on upgrading its computer systems. Previous coverage: You can can use your chip credit card Walmart and Target, but why not Publix? The technology is intended to better protect consumers from hackers and thieves, especially after major data breaches at Target, Home Depot and other retailers over the last several years. Jason Oxman, head of the Electronic Transactions Association trade group wrote in a blog post last week that it could be some time before the chip technology is universal: “We expected the transition to take at least five years ... But the pace of adoption here has been fast. In less than one year since the transition started, three-quarters of Americans already have at least one chip card.” About 30 percent of merchants in the U.S. currently have upgraded to chip readers, according to the ETA. Oxman said that the industry is working on fixing two major complaints with the chip readers: Speed and sound. “We are rolling out new terminal software upgrades to speed up the checkout time to two seconds or less. So you’ll have less time for awkward small talk with the checkout clerk,” he said. As for the loud beeping sound the chip terminals make when it’s time to remove the cards, he said it “won’t be necessary when we all get used to the new system.” Contact Alli Knothe at aknothe@tampabay.com.

Shannon Mullen “Go back to Lakewood you (expletive) Hasidic Jews," the woman said, according to police. Howell police say this woman cursed at and pushed an Orthodox Jewish teenager. (Photo: Courtesy of Howell police) HOWELL - Township police are trying to identify a woman they say cursed at and pushed an Orthodox Jewish 16-year-old at a Walmart. About 10 p.m. Sept. 5, the teen was standing in front of the store with friends, according to a police statement. The teen told police the woman entered the Walmart with another man. While entering the store, she turned toward the teen and confronted him "aggressively without provocation," according to the statement. The man tried to restrain her. She then asked the teen if he was from Lakewood and told him to “go back to Lakewood you [expletive] Hasidic Jews," according to the statement. She then pushed the boy and went into the store, leaving minutes later, before police arrived. Detective Sergeant Christian Antunez explained that both the comment and the push are criminal acts.

REUTERS/John Gress/FilesMore By Nandita Bose CHICAGO (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N> said it paid more than $201 million in second-quarter bonuses to hourly store staff as 99 percent of its stores met targets for cleanliness, faster checkout and better service. The world's largest retailer said 932,000 store employees received a quarterly cash bonus this year. This was a jump from 880,000 employees in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and 687,000 workers in fiscal 2015. On a per-employee basis, the average bonus comes to about $220. Quarterly bonuses can account for up to 5 percent of a Wal-Mart store employee's total annual income, the retailer said. Wal-Mart is the largest private employer in the United States. Its 1.5 million workers include store staff, store management and truck drivers. Hourly employees at the company's nearly 4,600 U.S. locations are eligible for quarterly bonuses based on the performance of their store. This increase in bonuses comes after the retailer bucked a string of weak earnings by its rivals and reported a better-than-expected quarterly performance last month. Wal-Mart said it benefited from more efficient U.S. stores and higher employee wages that fostered better customer service. At the same time the retailer is cutting back-office jobs, announcing earlier this month the elimination of about 7,000 positions, mostly in accounting and invoicing at its U.S. stores. It will offer these affected employees consumer-facing positions. Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg said until two years ago Wal-Mart's internal targets focused more on metrics like higher store sales. However, in the past two years the retailer has pivoted towards a greater emphasis on customer service by bringing more employees to the front of the store from its back rooms. Entry-level wages have also been increased to $10 an hour and $2.7 billion will be invested in employee compensation and training over two years, a move Wal-Mart says has contributed to improved service levels. The retailer also recently launched a new system for scheduling workers at 650 U.S. stores to improve staffing levels during peak shopping times and offer more certainty over hours for employees. Wal-Mart's shares traded up 0.44 percent at $72.29 per share in early trade on Wednesday.

(NYSE: WMT) awarded over $200 million in cash bonuses to over 900,000 hourly associates in the United States to reward their performances in the second quarter. The move aims at enhancing the store experience for its customers. The retailer indicated the evolved incentive plan was meant to reward associates if their stores met performance criteria beyond the customer service goals. The company indicated that an associate could earn the bonus four times in a year. Wal-Mart's executive vice president of supercenters in the United States, Mike Moore, commented, "Whether it's buying something for their kids, treating themselves or saving for something great, bonus time at Walmart is always a special time for our associates." Related Link: Expected 4% Retail Sales Gain This Holiday Season Is Bad News For Large Retailers Last year, the retailer disclosed $2.7 billion investment on its associates over a two-year period. This included higher wages, training and education. While indicating that the second-quarter bonus is not part of the $2.7 billion investment plan, the company said that over 1.2 million associates got pay increases.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 6:25 PM, September 21, 2016 Updated: 10:50 PM, September 21, 2016 CHICAGO - Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N> said it paid more than $201 million in second-quarter bonuses to hourly store staff as 99 percent of its stores met targets for cleanliness, faster checkout and better service. The world's largest retailer said 932,000 store employees received a quarterly cash bonus this year. This was a jump from 880,000 employees in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and 687,000 workers in fiscal 2015. On a per-employee basis, the average bonus comes to about $220. Quarterly bonuses can account for up to 5 percent of a Wal-Mart store employee's total annual income, the retailer said. Wal-Mart is the largest private employer in the United States. Its 1.5 million workers include store staff, store management and truck drivers. Hourly employees at the company's nearly 4,600 U.S. locations are eligible for quarterly bonuses based on the performance of their store. This increase in bonuses comes after the retailer bucked a string of weak earnings by its rivals and reported a better-than-expected quarterly performance last month. Wal-Mart said it benefited from more efficient U.S. stores and higher employee wages that fostered better customer service. At the same time the retailer is cutting back-office jobs, announcing earlier this month the elimination of about 7,000 positions, mostly in accounting and invoicing at its U.S. stores. It will offer these affected employees consumer-facing positions. Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg said until two years ago Wal-Mart's internal targets focused more on metrics like higher store sales. However, in the past two years the retailer has pivoted towards a greater emphasis on customer service by bringing more employees to the front of the store from its back rooms. Entry-level wages have also been increased to $10 an hour and $2.7 billion will be invested in employee compensation and training over two years, a move Wal-Mart says has contributed to improved service levels. The retailer also recently launched a new system for scheduling workers at 650 U.S. stores to improve staffing levels during peak shopping times and offer more certainty over hours for employees. Wal-Mart's shares traded up 0.44 percent at $72.29 per share in early trade on Wednesday.

'Never knew I could feel like this', the tweet posted to Jacqueline Vandagriff's Twitter said on September 15.  Vandagriff had been found dismembered and burned in Acorn Woods Park in Grapevine, Texas, on September 14.  Jacqueline Vandagriff (left) was found burned and dismembered in a Texas park this week. Charles Dean Bryant (right) is charged with her murder A day after her murder, a tweet appeared to Vandagriff's Twitter account, which said: 'Never knew I could feel like this' Authorities responded to a fire in the park at 6.30am where the remains of Vandagriff were found inside a plastic kiddie pool. A witness told police they saw a man standing over the fire before leaving, according to an arrest report. Vandagriff, 24, of Frisco, was identified after an autopsy by the Tarrant County Medical Examiner following the grim discovery. Grapevine police then arrested Charles Dean Bryant, 30, near his house in Haslet on Sunday, about 20 miles from where Vandagriff's body was found.  After officers worked around-the-clock to investigate the case in several cities in north Texas, they arrested Bryant at around 2.30pm on Sunday.  It's not clear if the two knew each other before meeting at a bar, but around 6.45pm on September 13, Vandagriff tweeted: 'I'm glad I decided to get off tinder and walked to a bar.' At 8.20pm, Bryant posted to Facebook saying, 'Just walking in the rain.. emo as f***'. First they are seen in security footage leaving Fry Street Public House (pictured) and later down the road leaving the Shots and Crafts bar together around 11pm Bryant was later spotted in security footage buying a shovel from a Walmart at 4.41am on September 14 Bryant, who CBS News reports as having worked at gay dance club the Urban Cowboy Saloon in Fort Worth, was seen in security footage going to two bars in Denton with Vandagriff. First they are seen in footage leaving Fry Street Public House and later down the road leaving the Shots and Crafts bar together around 11pm.

Share this article Share 40 shares ‘We were able to talk to employees of that bar and they have us a name of a suspect, and we just followed the trail from there,’ Grapevine police Sgt. Robert Eberling said.  Then at 10.56pm, Bryant posts on Facebook again saying: 'Teach you tricks that will blow your mind.' The statement is a lyric from the TV On The Radio song 'Wolf Like Me', which is about sex. According to an arrest warrant, cell phone records show Vandagriff's phone was in the vicinity of Bryant's house around 1am that night, CBS News reported.  Vandagriff's purse was also found in the trash at Bryant's home.  Earlier in the night Vandagriff posted on Twitter that she was glad she got off the dating app Tinder and went to a bar A day after her death, this eerie tweet appeared on Vandagriff's Facebook page. Police are investigating the tweet after they were made aware. The 24-year-old's purse was found in a garbage can at Bryant's house  At 4.41am, Bryant is caught on security footage buying a shovel from a Walmart, according to police.  There was evidence at this home in Haslet that someone had tried to dig a hole in the backyard. Investigators also noticed there was a patch in the backyard, which indicated a kiddie pool had been placed there.  Another kiddie pool, similar to the one Vandagriff was found in, was in the backyard.  Bryant's roommate told police there used to be two kiddie pools - but only one was there when police arrived. Two days after her murder, Bryant posted to Facebook saying: 'Full moon.. lets see what trouble I can get into'. In the time between Vandagriff's death and Bryant's arrest, the 30-year-old visited two parks, one at 6am, writing: 'Early mornings and sleepless nights but she got you feeling alright.' At 11.56pm on the night he allegedly murdered Vandagriff, Bryant posted this status to Facebook Days later, he posted a tweet about the full moon and said 'let's see what trouble I can get into' He also posted once about 'detesting liars' and another time saying: 'Never let anyone else dictate your life, if you're happy and aren't hurting anyone, other people's opinions don't matter be it family, friends, strangers.  'Do what you want, Love who you want, Live your life!!' Bryant had been arrested several times in the days leading up to Vandagriff's death. According to the Dallas Morning News, Bryant's 18-year-old ex-girlfriend - a student at University of North Texas - had broken up with him on August 23. The day after the breakup, Bryant showed up at his ex-grilfriend's dorm. The woman, who he had dated for three months, called the police. Bryant was given a criminal trespass warning on August 25.  Vandagriff's body was found in a kiddie pool similar to one found in Bryant's backyard. Bryant's roommate said there had recently been two kiddie pools in the backyard where there is now only one Just days before he was seen with Vandagriff, Bryant had been arrested several times for allegedly stalking his ex-girlfriend Then, on August 31, He then showed up at the restaurant where his ex-girlfriend worked and asked to be seated in her section. She called the police and they told him to stop contact or he would be arrested. Then on September 6, Bryant showed up on the doorstep of his ex-girlfriend's dorm and said he had something for her.  She called police and he was arrested and charged with criminal trespass and taken to the Denton County Jail. He was released the next day and returned to the dorm where he was arrested again and charged with stalking. He posted bail on September 9.   A witness who saw the fire in this park after Vandagriff's murder said they saw a man standing over it According to his Facebook page, Bryant works at Procore Fitness.  However, Eberling said Bryant had worked at the gay dance club but had been fired on Sunday for not showing up for his shift. The Vandagriff family released a statement thanking the ‘extraordinary efforts’ of the Grapevine police department, FBI and all law enforcement agencies who assisted in the investigation. ‘We would also like to thank our friends, family and the friends of our daughter Jackie for all their support in this difficult time,’ the statement added. Vandagriff was a junior at Texas Woman’s University in Denton. The school’s Vice President for Student Life Monica Mendez-Grant paid tribute to Vandagriff in a statement on the school’s website. ‘The death of a student affects the entire TWU community, and I know that all of us send our deepest sympathy to Jacqueline's family and friends,’ she said. ‘Jacqueline exemplified the spirit of learning and service that is the hallmark of our TWU community. ‘She lived her life with a desire to serve others through her interest in nutrition.’ Bryant is charged with capital murder and is being held on a $1million bond.   Read more: Body Found in Grapevine Park Identified, Police Announce Arrest | NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth Jacqueline Vandagriff case: Tweet made from slain student's account day after her dismembered remains found - CBS News TV ON THE RADIO LYRICS - Wolf Like Me www.dallasnews.c...

I promise I won't do it again. Please stop!" as her father pulled the shopping trolley with her hair around the handle. Photo / Erika Burch / Facebook A father allegedly wrapped his 5-year-old daughter's hair around the handle of a shopping trolley and dragged her through a supermarket. The young child was crying "please stop. I promise I won't do it again. Please stop." The incident at a Walmart in Cleveland, Texas, was captured on camera by alarmed shoppers Erika and Robert Burch and is now being investigated by police as child endangerment. "People are telling me I'm wrong for stepping up for this little girl, but you can discipline a child without dragging them by the hair on their head, especially in WalMart," Erika Burch told KTRK. Erika Burch said in a Facebook post that she and her husband were buying food for their children's school lunches when her husband pointed out that a man was dragging his daughter by the hair on her head, by wrapping it around the shopping trolley. "She is begging him to stop ... 'please stop, I promise I won't do it again, please stop'." She claims she told the father to stop what he was doing with his daughter and he told her to "mind my own business". "I have three little girls of my own," Erika Burch told the Chronicle. "I'll be damned if I'll ever let anybody pull them by the hair of their heads." Erika Burch telephoned the police and an officer who was in the store told her that for there to be any investigation there had to be visible injuries. She published the pictures on her Facebook page in the hope they would alert authorities. Cleveland Police said on its Facebook page that it had received "numerous calls" about a girl being pulled by her hair at Walmart. Cleveland Police Chief Darrel Broussard told the Chronicle that police received a call about the incident about 4:45pm on Monday. The man, whom Broussard did not identify, told police that his three children including the 5-year-old girl, had been disruptive in the store, and that holding her by the hair was his method of disciplining her. - news.com.au Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Discover more Loading Loading Herald Services Book your ad Driven Photos for sale True Commercial Death Notices Public Notices Our Regional News Stories The Northern Advocate Wyn Drabble: Xmas shopping made easy Trade Me can help you with your Christmas shopping.

Just like Barack Obama, the man she served for four years, Clinton sees it as her obligation to stoke the fires of racial tension while going out of her way to downplay Islamic terrorism. Saturday night a bomb went off in a Manhattan neighborhood. The day before, a black man was shot by a white policewoman. Reacting to the bombing event, Clinton was muted. Some said she seemed sedated or “zombie-like.” Hillary said, “We have to let this investigation unfold.” She also attacked Donald Trump for making rash statements about a bomb, adding, “I’ll have more to say about it when we actually know some facts.” In contrast, Clinton went on the “Steve Harvey Morning Show” [Tuesday] to offer her thoughts about last week’s police shooting in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Here Hillary was not so restrained. There were no calls to let this investigation unfold. Clinton appeared to assume that the female police officer was a racist cop. She called the incident “absolutely inexplicable.” Hillary said she would combat police violence by “speaking directly to white people” and vowed “to go right at implicit bias.” Do you see the difference, my friends? Hillary didn’t call the bombing in New York City “absolutely inexplicable.” She didn’t promise to speak directly to the Muslim community or go right at radical Islamic extremism. No, Hillary’s harshest criticism was reserved for the police, not the jihadists. Chaos In Charlotte Hillary Clinton and the left have repeatedly accused Donald Trump of using rhetoric that incites Islamic terrorism. But the left never accepts responsibility for its own rhetoric. Chaos erupted in Charlotte, North Carolina, [Tuesday] night after reports of a police shooting in that city. More than a dozen law enforcement officers were injured in the rioting. One officer was hit in the head by a rock. “Protestors” looted a Walmart, stealing flat-screen TVs, iPads and other electronics. Hundreds of demonstrators stormed a major interstate and shut down traffic. They broke into tractor trailers and burned the cargo on the highway. A police cruiser was also destroyed. The violence in Charlotte erupted after Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by a police officer. A woman claiming to be Scott’s daughter said in a Facebook video that her father was sitting in a parked car, reading a book and waiting for his son at a bus stop when officers killed him. That was a lie, just like “hands up, don’t shoot.” Charlotte-Mecklenberg Police Chief Kerr Putney said [Tuesday], “It’s time to change the narrative, because I can tell you from the facts that the story is a little bit different as to how it’s been portrayed so far, especially through social media.” According to Chief Putney, “Scott exited his vehicle armed with a handgun as officers continued to yell at him to drop it. He stepped out, posing a threat to the officers.” By the way, no book was found. An increasingly visible and radical figure in Charlotte is B. J. Murphy, a local Nation of Islam leader. That is interesting because media have reported that rioters were yelling, “We’re out like the Taliban!” Murphy is calling for an economic boycott of the city. “We’re watching our black men this week being gunned down, and there’s no redress for our grievances of black people being killed,” Murphy said. “Since black lives do not matter in this city, then our black dollars shouldn’t matter. We’re calling on all black people in Charlotte to keep your money in your pocket,” Murphy added. But is this really a racial issue? Keith Scott was a black man. Officer Brently Vinson, the police officer who shot Scott, is a graduate of Liberty University and a black man. Chief Kerr Putney is a black man. Four years ago, Mecklenburg County, where Charlotte is located, voted by 23 points for a black man to be president of the United States. By the way, the initial protests were peaceful. But following the pattern we have seen in city after city, a gang of professional agitators turned up and that’s when the situation turned violent. Is anyone at Obama’s Department of Justice investigating these groups that are turning peaceful demonstrations into riots, endangering the lives of innocent bystanders and our law enforcement officials? No, they aren’t. They are too busy trying to impose federal control of local law enforcement. After eight years of Obama/Clinton, America’s racial divide is worse than at any time in recent history. And they were the ones who were supposed to bring racial reconciliation. Obama’s Plea For Open Borders President Barack Obama delivered his last speech at the United Nations General Assembly [Tuesday]. (That’s something to cheer about!) But even when speaking for the last time as president of the United States before the world body, Obama couldn’t resist the temptation to get political and to bash Donald Trump. Obama said, “Today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself.” That was the line virtually every media outlet seized on. ABC News ran with this headline: “Obama Evokes Trump’s Wall in Final UN Assembly Speech as President.” In a world plagued by radical Islamic terrorism, with ISIS committing genocide and hiding terrorists among the migrants flooding into Europe and even America, Obama parrots George Soros and suggests that borders are the problem, that walls are wrong. Really? Well, tear down your fence around the White House, Mr. President. Have you seen Saudi Arabia’s wall? Obama and Hillary want to bring in tens of thousands of additional Middle Eastern refugees, even though top officials have warned that they cannot be adequately vetted. (By the way, the number of immigrants who were issued deportation orders and then mistakenly granted citizenship is far greater than initially reported. It’s not 800, but more than 1,800.) I don’t know what alternate universe Obama is living in, but the American people reject it. A new poll finds that just 18% of Americans support the Obama/Clinton plan to bring 110,000 more Muslim refugees to America, while 62% say the plan “poses an increased national security risk to the United States.” Tweet Click here to show comments Subscribe Comment Top Headlines Sen.

Lindsay Shively 6:00 PM, Sep 22, 2016 10:50 AM, Sep 23, 2016 Share Article A photo of Crown Center as it stood in 1989. Copyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next KANSAS CITY, Mo. - In 2007, no new enclosed malls were built in the United States. It was the first time since the 1950's that had happened according to The Smithsonian. From the most recent recession to changing consumer habits including online shopping, many enclosed malls across the country and Kansas City did not survive. A few continue to draw shoppers. Some await the wrecking ball. Some continue to face uncertain futures even if demolition has started or even finished. Some have already transformed. Here is a look at how twelve of Kansas City's once enclosed shopping centers look today. Antioch Center  Opening in 1956, Antioch was originally an open air shopping center until becoming fully enclosed in 1978. In 2010, IAS Partners began plans to redevelop the mall as Antioch Crossing. Burlington Coat Factory and Sears stayed after renovations and a new Walmart Neighborhood Market opened in 2014. Other buildings with smaller retail shops opened as well. Bannister  Bannister Mall closed in 2007 and was torn down in 2009. Once a sprawling mall of one million square feet in south Kansas City, the site sat empty for years. Then in 2014, crews broke ground on a $4.4 billion redevelopment for Cerner. The healthcare technology company said in June that three thousand employees will work at the former Bannister Mall site in January 2017. Blue Ridge Mall  Originally developed as an open air mall in the late 1950s, Blue Ridge was renovated as an enclosed mall in the early 1970s. The first of their three enclosed mall redevelopments in Kansas City, Dave Horn with IAS Partners says Blue Ridge Crossing east of Sterling Avenue was finished in 2008.  He adds he believes plans were in place just in the nick of time before the recession. Blue Ridge Crossing is anchored by a Wal-Mart Supercenter and Lowe’s stores as well as several other smaller retail stores and restaurants including Starbucks and Chipotle. Crown Center  This 300,000 square foot shopping center opened in 1973 as a vision of the Hall family. The international headquarters of Hallmark Cards is also a part of the larger 85-acre Crown Center complex. Change in recent years included the additions of SEA LIFE Aquarium and Legoland Discovery Center. Renovations in 2014 created a new 60,000 square foot Halls store. The American Restaurant, a long-time fine dining restaurant, will transition to a pop-up dining and event venue in 2017.  Great Mall of the Great Plains  With about one million square feet of indoor retail, this mall opened in 1997 but closed in the fall of 2015. Developers at Van Trust real estate say a combination of changing shoppers’ habits like online shopping and the economic downturn was behind the closure. Demolition is slated to be done around the end of 2016. The future of this mall site is still uncertain. Developers say they are still looking for the right plan.  Independence Center  Opening in 1974, the mall underwent center-wide renovations in 1998 with additional renovations in 2015. Last year, mall officials say 15 new retailers moved into the mall and eight retailers remodeled. We asked how the mall has continued to function as an enclosed mall when so many other malls have not survived. Angela Pyszczynski, the mall's general manager, said family-friendly events are as key as the right mix of retail when customer demands keep changing. "It is about so much more than just the purchase," she said. "It's about the experience." Indian Springs Mall  Officials from the Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas say crews are in the midst of demolition at this mall and hope to have it finished by the end of the year. So far, they say they are still looking for a developer for the property. Lane4 is also working with the local government on the redevelopment. The Wyandotte Daily shared some memories about the Indian Springs Mall just before it was demolished.  Metcalf South Shopping Center  Opening in 1967 at the corner of 95th and Metcalf, the mall is still standing but awaits demolition. Mike Berenbomb from Lane4 hopes demolition will begin by the end of the year once a final development plan gets approval from Overland Park city officials. He says demolition should take about six months. New plans for an open air convenience center include a Lowe’s store expected to open in 2018. Metro North Mall  In a matter of weeks, developers at IAS Partners say the wrecking ball will take down almost all of the once-bustling one million square foot Metro North Mall. The mall officially closed in April 2014 but had been largely empty for years, once a staple of its Northland neighborhood since opening in September 1976. The existing Macy’s store will stay open during redevelopment as a new open air concept is built. The developer hopes a cinema, specialty grocer, hotel, new restaurants, residential space, and other retail will fill the new mixed use design. A movie theater, they say, is the next likely confirmed tenant they will announce. Mission Shopping Center  This mall opened in 1956 according to the Johnson County Museum and was torn down in 2006. That lot has now been empty for about a decade. There is a plan but the latest version of the plan to redevelop the site of the old Mission Mall was rejected by the Mission City Council in August 2016. Those plans included a redevelopment anchored by a Wal-Mart with apartments on top. The Mayor and other city leaders say they are now waiting to hear back from the developer. Ward Parkway Center  Developers from Legacy Development say renovation at this 52 year old mall in south Kansas City started in 2012. Now you’ll find a remodeled AMC theater and the popular Trader Joe’s with the center’s mix as an enclosed mall with many stores like Target accessible from the parking lot. This April, crews broke ground on a $16 million addition that will include five new restaurants and an outdoor patio space.   Oak Park Mall  One of the few remaining enclosed malls in the Kansas City area, Oak Park Mall still regularly sees its parking lot full of shoppers. The mall opened in stages from 1974 to 1976. When asked how this enclosed mall had survived when many across the country haven’t, company officials told us a few reasons from the right mix of retail to having exclusive stores in the market like American Girl, Microsoft, and Nordstrom. Those stores, they say, give people a reason to visit Oak Park over other retail locations. --- Lindsay Shively can be reached at lindsay.shively@kshb.com.

Most of SLU was relatively unfamiliar with the selected performers when they were first announced, but by the end of the week their hits records could be heard pulsing through open windows around campus. 2. The ACE snack table backstage is a drunk munchie mecca of high fructose corn syrup and sodium infused indulgence. 3. Ryn Weaver came to Canton without socks and had to detour to Walmart for a pair. 4. Weaver’s first record was inspired after escaping a terrible relationship, getting into a really good one, and then ending that one after realizing she needed to seek validation in herself in order to truly come into her own. 5. The songstress spent time at NYC’s Fashion Week before trekking up to SLU. She’s been living with friends in the city and will be relocating to Harlem (with her cat) soon. 6. She advises us to be persistent in what we want. In her own words: “hustle, ladies!” 7. Before mixing beats with his brother, Hippie Kevin Saurer was a political science major. He once aspired to be “Karl Rove for the good guys”- someone who will win elections for the liberals. 8. Kevin, though a Sanders supporter during primary season, does not have a very good Bernie impression. Don’t ask him to do one. 9. Hippie Sabotage’s tour manager requests jerseys from every college that they perform at. They’ve amassed three so far, which makes an official collection. 10. Both groups proved they weren’t above a small town get down when they joined SLU students at the Hoot Owl after the show. Ryn Weaver loves a good selfie and has certainly mastered the art of taking them.

Business Bargain chains lead list of fastest-growing retailers America's fastest-growing retailers As many retailers cut back, here’s a list of retailers adding the most new store space. The data, provided by CoStar, is based on retailers’ announced plans for new store openings, in square feet, through the second quarter of 2016. As many retailers cut back, here’s a list of retailers adding the most new store space. The data, provided by CoStar, is based on retailers’ announced plans for new store openings, in square feet, through the second quarter of 2016. Lauren ZumbachContact ReporterChicago Tribune Not all retailers are trimming back their brick-and-mortar footprints. Dollar stores and off-price chains, taking advantage of solid sales and bargain-hunting shoppers, are on an expansion kick, claiming half the spots on a list of 10 retailers adding the most new store square footage, according to commercial real estate and analytics firm CoStar. Dollar General, second overall, led a trio of dollar stores in CoStar's top 10, based on retailers' announced U.S. store openings as of the second quarter of 2016. Dollar General, which started the year with nearly 12,500 stores, has announced plans to open 900 more this year and another 1,000 in 2017. Last week, the chain said it's looking to hire 10,000 new employees by mid-October. Dollar General James C.

(James C. Svehla / Chicago Tribune) About 80 of this year's new Dollar Generals will be roughly 20 percent smaller than typical locations, designed for urban areas where larger stores would be too costly or rural areas with fewer potential customers, spokeswoman Crystal Ghassemi said earlier this year. Family Dollar will add about 4.3 million square feet of retail space, and Dollar Tree — which acquired Family Dollar last year — is adding about 3.2 million, according to CoStar. Part of the appeal is convenience, which makes a big network of stores important. Dollar stores also tend to drive growth with new locations, not big growth in sales at existing stores, said Hunter Harris, vice president at consulting firm Boston Retail Partners. Dollar General's comparable store sales were up 0.7 percent in the second quarter of 2016 over the same period last year, while Dollar Tree's grew by 1.2 percent. Big-box chains could start trying to match their prices, so keeping that growth going is "not going to be an easy task," Harris said. If more people begin purchasing basic consumer goods and personal care products online, a big retail footprint could become a liability if stores can't find ways to stand out, said Steven Barr, PricewaterhouseCoopers' U.S. retail and consumer sector leader. U.S. holiday sales to grow, but big chains getting smaller piece Sarah Very and Lindsey Rupp U.S. retail sales will grow about 4 percent this holiday season, buoyed by a better job market, according to a forecast by Deloitte.

U.S. retail sales will grow about 4 percent this holiday season, buoyed by a better job market, according to a forecast by Deloitte. Still, the news isn't all good for big retail chains. Consumers are increasingly buying gifts at niche retailers, potentially pulling spending away from places like... (Sarah Very and Lindsey Rupp) But the price point "clearly has resonated," even with higher-income customers and deal-hungry millennials, Harris said. Chicago has a Logan Square Dollar General and a Dollar Tree in Lakeview. "We see them popping up in neighborhoods and regions you wouldn't have expected to find them 10 years ago." Similarly, off-price chains Marshalls and T.J. Maxx — sixth and seventh on CoStar's list, with plans to add 3 million and about 2.9 million square feet, respectively — draw customers with the "treasure hunt" of finding a deal, Harris said. Parent company TJX Cos. reported a 6 percent increase in sales at stores open at least a year in the first half of the 2017 fiscal year. Relative outliers on the list were specialty retailers Dick's Sporting Goods and Bolingbrook-based cosmetics retailer Ulta Beauty, both of whom appear to be taking advantage of "strong market niches," said Neil Stern, senior partner at Chicago-based consulting firm McMillanDoolittle. Ulta Beauty sits pretty as profits, sales continue to rise Alexia Elejalde-Ruiz Ulta Beauty's streak of radiant earnings showed no signs of slowing Thursday as the cosmetics chain reported a strong fiscal first quarter that topped Wall Street's expectations and raised guidance for the next.

The Bolingbrook-based chain, which sells mass-market and high-end cosmetics as well... (Alexia Elejalde-Ruiz) Ulta, which carries a wide selection of beauty brands across a wide range of price points, has been on a growth tear, opening at least 100 stores a year since 2011, according to a statement from Dave Kimbell, chief merchandising and marketing officer. Ulta had 907 stores as of July 30, and sales at stores open at least 14 months were up about 14 percent in the second quarter of 2016, the company said in August. "They had a vision that the customer wanted a hyperselection of cosmetics and beauty," Harris said. "If you have an innovative mix, the consumer responds." Many customers still like to shop for cosmetics in person, where they can test products. And unlike specialty retailers that focus on a particular trend and risk being left with lots of stores and few sales when customers move on, Ulta can swap in new brands and products as needed, he said. Wal-Mart led CoStar's list with 11.2 million square feet of new Super Centers — including Illinois locations in Olympia Fields, Richton Park, Centralia and Carpentersville that have opened this year, and another in Homewood coming in October — and 3.8 million square feet in smaller-format Neighborhood Market stores, according to CoStar. But Wal-Mart also is reducing about 2.2 million square feet of Super Center space, according to CoStar's data. The retailer also recently shut down its Wal-Mart Express stores, which at 13,000 square feet, were less than half the size of a Neighborhood Market, to focus on its other store formats, said spokeswoman Delia Garcia. The list counts new square footage, not new stores, potentially leaving out fast-growing retailers with a smaller footprint, newcomers starting with a small base or those that haven't made big announcements around future store growth plans. It also leaves out retailers that are still bullish on brick-and-mortar but opening fewer, more upscale stores, Barr said. "You see a lot of doom and gloom, but for retailers with a really innovative product, really good service, or where it's very clear to the customer what they're doing and why they're different, the consumer will find them," Harris said. Here's the list of the 10 retailers that have announced the most new square footage as of the second quarter of 2016, according to CoStar: 1. Wal-Mart (Super Centers and Neighborhood Markets), 15,020,000 square feet 2. Dollar General, 6,529,566 square feet 3. Forever 21, 5,700,000 square feet 4. Family Dollar, 4,272,893 square feet 5. Dollar Tree, 3,210,000 square feet 6. Marshalls, 3,007,000 square feet 7. T.J. Maxx, 2,873,989 square feet 8. Dick's Sporting Goods, 2,650,000 square feet 9.

(Thomas Ondrey, The Plain Dealer) Print Email Dan Labbe, cleveland.com By Dan Labbe, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 22, 2016 at 4:59 PM, updated September 22, 2016 at 5:22 PM comments BEREA, Ohio -- If Miami Dolphins players continue their protest during Sunday's national anthem before their game against the Browns, wide receiver Andrew Hawkins -- as outspoken as any NFL player in regards to police violence against African-Americans -- supports the message those players and others in the NFL and other sports are sending.  "I support it," Hawkins said of the protests, started by 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick during the preseason and other players since. "It's not so much about the kneeling as much as it is about the message. And it's a message that you guys all know I'm passionate about and we've kind of been through this before."  Two seasons ago, Hawkins wore a shirt during warm-ups prior to the Browns' game against the Bengals that read "Justice for Tamir Rice and John Crawford." It was referring, of course, to the police shootings of 12-year-old Rice in Cleveland and Crawford, who was shot in a Wal-Mart in Beavercreek, Ohio after waving an air rifle.  Browns' Andrew Hawkins on Colin Kaepernick's protest "My wearing of the T-shirt wasn't a stance against every police officer or every police department," Hawkins said in December of 2014. "My wearing of the T-shirt was a stance against wrong individuals doing the wrong thing for the wrong reason to innocent people."  Since those incidents, there have been multiple other incidents involving police violence against African-Americans, including Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in St. Paul, Minnesota. Most recently, protests in Charlotte, North Carolina have turned violent in response to the police killing of Keith Lamont Scott. News also broke on Thursday that Tulsa police officer Betty Shelby has been charged with first-degree manslaughter after fatally shooting an unarmed black man. Kaepernick's protest was first noticed on Aug. 26 by Niner Nation's Jennifer Lee Chan. The quarterback sat during the national anthem for the first three games of the preseason, a gesture that initially went unnoticed, then began kneeling, instead of sitting, prior to the fourth preseason game after meeting with former Green Beret Nate Boyer.  Kaepernick explained his reasoning for protest a few days after it was initially noticed:   "I'm going to continue to stand with the people that are being oppressed. To me, this is something that has to change. When there's significant change and I feel that flag represents what it's supposed to represent, and this country is representing people the way that it's supposed to, I'll stand."  "This stand wasn't for me. This is because I'm seeing things happen to people that don't have a voice, people that don't have a platform to talk and have their voices heard, and effect change. So I'm in the position where I can do that and I'm going to do that for people that can't."  Other NFL players, including the Dolphins' Arian Foster, Michael Thomas, Kenny Stills and Jelani Jenkins, joined in the protest at the start of the regular season. Foster, Thomas and Stills all knelt last week prior to the Dolphins' game against the Patriots. Other athletes in other sports have participated as well, including women's professional soccer player and member of the US Women's National Team Megan Rapinoe of the Seattle Reign and the entire roster of the Indiana Fever. The protests have even spread to the high school level, including Brunswick senior Rodney Axson Jr.  See a SB Nation timeline of the national anthem protest Hawkins, who has not participated in the protests to this point, said Thursday that those criticizing the protests over the gesture of kneeling during the anthem are missing the point.  "I can't remember a protest where everybody was like, 'Oh, man, that's an awesome protest' in the history of America," he said. "If you don't give a damn about the message, you don't have to give a damn. That's also your right. But to make it about the actual protest gesture, whatever it may be, I think that's small-minded and I think as time goes on you'll see there'll be a lot of people that are on the wrong side of history."  Hawkins was asked if he had considered joining the protest.  "I never questioned the way a guy protests or the way a guy grieves," he said. "Those are two things. So I have my method of protest, they have their method. Everyone has their method. Like I said, I don't think me, what I'm going to do is important. It's about the message. It's about what the issue is at hand. Any conversation about anything else is kind of pointless if it's not about the message."  Hawkins said the fact that the protests have started a conversation show they're working. He called those conversations "an important step to the next steps."  "I think that there's definitely conversation, obviously you guys are asking me about it now," he said, "so, of course, I think the message is out there and it's starting the conversation."  The impact of those conversations, Hawkins said is something he doesn't know how to track -- and may not be evident for some time.  "(Kaepernick) raising the awareness, people having the conversation, you don't know who that's going to affect," he said. "You don't know what 12-year-old kid is watching Kaepernick and might start asking critical questions about it. He might grow up to be a judge. He might grow up to be a police officer. He might grow up to be anything that could help the situation."  Video: Andrew Hawkins explains wearing a Justice for Tamir Rice and John Crawford t-shirt in December 2014 -----  Follow me: on Twitter | on Facebook  Scoreboard NFL scores | Standings | Stats © 2013 STATS LLC.

Minnesota Vikings Sports Commentary 4 0 0 September 22, 2016 Carolina Panthers Schedule: 5 Bold Predictions For Week 3 Of 2016 NFL Season Vs. Minnesota Vikings Jason Fletcher The Carolina Panthers’ schedule shows that the Minnesota Vikings will be visiting Bank of America Stadium during Week 3 of the 2016 NFL Season, but there’s no way the team could’ve predicted the other news that is happening in the city of Charlotte this week. The entire city is in a state of unrest after the shooting death of Keith Lamont Scott by Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer Brentley Vinson. Protesters have taken to the streets in Charlotte the last couple of days and done extensive property damage to local businesses while looting locations such as Wal-Mart and the Charlotte Hornets team store at Time Warner Cable Arena. Fox 46 Charlotte reported earlier on Thursday that the NFL, Panthers, and Vikings were discussing possibly moving the game to another location. It has since been announced that the league is planning to keep the game in Charlotte as scheduled, but will continue to monitor the situation. .@Panthers to play Sunday home game; Michael Jordan reacts to violent #CharlotteProtests https://t.co/guwp5TSuZL pic.twitter.com/WVbDLFfVDF — WGXA (@WGXAnews) September 22, 2016 A football game seems like the least important thing for the city of Charlotte at the moment, but perhaps the Panthers will be able to help pull the city together. Either way, it has to be tough to prepare for the 2-0 Minnesota Vikings when there is so much going on in the streets outside the Bank of America Stadium. The Carolina Panthers are 1-1 to this point in their 2016 schedule as they lost 21-20 during Week 1 to the defending Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos, but rebounded to take down the San Francisco 49ers in Week 2, 46-27. The team has yet to play like it’s capable but is a Graham-Gano-missed field goal away from being 2-0. The Vikings enter this heavyweight showdown with victories over the Tennessee Titans and Green Bay Packers in their first two games of the 2016 NFL Season. Unfortunately, for Minnesota, the team has lost starting quarterback Teddy Bridgewater and starting left tackle Matt Kalil for the season and running back Adrian Peterson for at least the next couple of months. There will be a lot of pressure on Sam Bradford and the defense the rest of the year. Let’s get to some bold predictions for this major NFC matchup. 1. James Bradberry Will Shut Down Stefon Diggs This guy allowed a 0.0 passer rating, when his area was targeted: James Bradberry. pic.twitter.com/XENO84WL3L — bob (@ChickenNGreens) September 19, 2016 Diggs leads the NFL in receiving yards with 285 yards and is second in the league with 16 receptions. He’s coming off of a game against the Packers where he caught nine balls for 182 yards and a touchdown and is likely licking his chops as he gets a matchup with a rookie corner out of Samford in Week 3. Unfortunately, for Diggs, that rookie corner is James Bradberry, who was Pro Football Focus’s top-rated corner in Week 2 as he only allowed one catch for six yards on seven targets. Look for Diggs to have a tough time on Sunday. 2. Vikings Will Gain Over 100 Yards Rushing The Vikings are last in the NFL in rush offense as they have averaged a measly 47.5 rushing yards per game this season. The offensive line has been one of the worst run-blocking units in the NFL and Peterson largely struggled to get back to the line of scrimmage on a number of occasions. The good news for the Vikings is that the Panthers’ weakness on defense is stopping the run which means Jerick McKinnon and Matt Asiata could easily amass 100 yards combined. 3. Panthers Won’t Reach 100 Yards Rushing Carolina finished second in the NFL in 2015 with 142.6 rushing yards per game and currently lead the NFL in 2016 as the team has averaged a whopping 166.5 yards on the ground through two games. That being said, the Vikings have always been one of the stingiest run defenses in the league, and this year is no different as they’re only allowing 73.5 yards rushing through two games. 4. Carolina Will Hold Sam Bradford Under 200 Yards Passing During his first start for his new team last week, Bradford threw for 286 yards and completed 71 percent of his passes. Don’t expect that same success against the Panthers as Carolina is one of the toughest teams in the NFL to throw on. Look for defensive coordinator Sean McDermott to send heavy pressure any time the Vikings drop back to pass. 5. Panthers Win A Defensive Battle These two teams boast two of the top seven defenses in the NFL through two weeks. Expect a low-scoring, field-position battle that with the team that wins the turnover battle emerging victorious. The Carolina Panthers’ defense has forced five turnovers to the Minnesota Vikings’ one so we’ll give the edge to the home team, 17-13, as the team improves to 2-1 on their 2016 schedule.

DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today ELF Beauty Thinks Its Customers Have A Bottomless Makeup Bag ELF Beauty is now officially a public company. Here is what the company's CEO has planned to keep the company's results looking sexy. Brian Sozzi Sep 22, 2016 3:24 PM EDT ELF Beauty is hoping that investors think its focus on affordable cosmetics with an upscale feel and strong U.S. cosmetics market is a sexy combination. Started as an online cosmetics seller over a decade ago, today ELF Beauty has over 11 retail stores across New York City and Los Angeles, and its foot in the door with major mass retailers such as Walmart (WMT) , Target (TGT) and CVS Health (CVS) . Target is ELF's longest standing national retail distribution partner, and represents about 23% of its sales. The company inked a deal to sell its offerings -- which mostly sell for $6 or less -- at Walmart in 2012, and the business has quickly grown to 28% of its annual business. Sales for the six months ended have tallied $96.8 million, up from $75.2 million a year earlier. Unlike many early stage growth companies going public, ELF Beauty is decently profitable. The company already works with Amazon (AMZN) , too, which is good news in light of the e-commerce giant recently launching a one-hour cosmetics delivery service in Chicago for Prime members. The health of the U.S. cosmetics markets should make ELF's expansion efforts a touch easier. The U.S. make-up market is anticipated to grow by a compound annual growth rate of 3.8% from 2013 to 2018, reaching $8.4 billion, according to research firm MarketResearch.

Facebook has finally decided to build in New Mexico, SAP is stepping into Colorado Springs in a big way, and data center providers Data Foundry and TierPoint are expanding their empires in Texas. Here are the details: New Mexico Scores $250M Facebook Data Center Build After a tax-break war with the State of Utah, New Mexico has secured a commitment from Facebook to build its next data center in the Village of Los Lunas. The first phase of construction, expected to start later this year, will produce a 510,000-square foot facility and cost about $250 million, according to a joint statement by Facebook and the office of New Mexico Governor Suzana Martinez. Facebook is likely to continue expanding in this location in the future as it does in its other data center locations. The company has selected Fortis Construction as the general contractor for the project. Fortis also built Facebook’s first company-owned and operated data center, located in Prineville, Oregon. Facebook expects to start serving traffic from Los Lunas starting in October 2018. Read more: Everything You Wanted to Know About Facebook Data Centers SAP Building Huge in Colorado Springs SAP America, US subsidiary of the German enterprise software giant SAP SE, has selected Colorado Springs as the location of two massive-scale future data centers. The company recently bought two plots of land – one on the northern side of town and the other on its southern side – for $3 million each, Colorado Springs Gazette reported. The north-side plot neighbors data centers by Progressive Insurance, FedEx, and Walmart. First phase of the data center build in the north will provide about 41,000 square feet and room to add another 60,000 square feet in the future, according to planning documents reviewed by The Gazette. The project in the south is similar in scope. In an interview, an SAP official told the newspaper that Colorado Springs was attractive to the company because of its efficient power supply, favorable climate, and availability of a quality workforce. Data Foundry to Kick Off $200M Build in Austin Data Foundry is preparing to break ground on the third data center in Austin, which is where the company is based. The future facility, called Texas 2, will go up on the company’s data center campus called Data Ranch, home to its Texas 1 data center. It expects to have invested about $200 million by the time all three planned construction phases are complete, ultimately delivering 165,000 square feet of raised floor in a 325,000-square foot facility. Phase One, due to start this this quarter, will “tentatively” launch in the third quarter of 2017, Data Foundry said in a statement. While there are other types of data centers in the Austin market, it is an especially desirable location for disaster recovery facilities, according to the data center provider. That’s primarily because the area rarely sees natural disasters and has its own power grid, independent from US national grid. Compass to Build TierPoint’s 40th Data Center in Dallas TierPoint, the company that started six years ago as Colo4Dallas, a local service provider in Dallas with a single data center, announced a plan for its 40th facility – a 90,000-square foot data center in Allen, Texas. The site’s first phase will provide 16,000 square feet of raised floor and cost about $20 million, the company said. Dallas-based Compass Datacenters will build the facility for TierPoint. Located about 25 miles north of Dallas, Allen is a high-tech community with easy access from pretty much anywhere in North Texas, according to TierPoint. The facility will serve as a good disaster-recovery option for its current customers as well as a place to expand IT infrastructure capacity, the company said.

(ANF) Stock Is Beyond All Hope It’s Time to Rethink How We Value Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock This Is the Best Thing to Happen to Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) In a While View All Posts Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) certainly tickled the ears of investors today, announcing it would be boosting an existing stock-buyback program of $10 billion by buying back an additional $5 billion worth of Target stock. Not bad for a company with a market cap of only $39.5 billion. And yet, beyond the headlines of the Target buybacks, shareholders know the retailer has lingering problems. To its credit, TGT has introduced some solutions as well. It developed a new small-store format, unveiled a wider array of groceries and delivered some heart-felt pleas to all its employees. It’s all falling flat so far with shoppers though, and by extension falling flat with investors and analysts. Target Stock Fizzling Out As a refresher, last quarter, Target managed to boost its year-over-year bottom line per share of TGT stock, though by most other (more important) measures it hit a wall. Same-store sales fell by 1.1%, and total company revenues fell 8% year over year. 9 Dividend Stocks for a Full Calendar of Safe Income There was more than one reason for the headwind. Arguably the biggest one is the boycott of Target by a few million consumers who are less than pleased with the retailer’s April decision to allow transgender people to use the stores’ restrooms of their choice. At least 1.4 million have signed a petition to stop shopping at Target, and countless more have stopped patronizing the company’s stores without signing the petition. It’s not just the transgender bathroom issue that has proven to be a headwind for the company and Target stock, however. Target is also losing relevancy as the “cheap chic” movement it largely helped define is now becoming increasingly fragmented. Rather than replace or rekindle that business though, the company is reworking its product mix and footprint. Struggling Initiatives One example of these initiatives is a recent effort to scale-up its existing grocery business. Shoppers haven’t bitten so far though. The impasse may be that Target isn’t seen as an alternative to more established grocer names like Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) or Kroger Co (NYSE:KR). Its stores may also be in the wrong locations for a grocery store. The scaled-up grocery business remains a work-in-progress. Most people remain unimpressed. Target has also introduced a small-store format now that — between it and Walmart — the large-store format has pretty well saturated most markets. Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell recently announced the retailer could be opening hundreds of these stores in the foreseeable future, building on the 32 such locales that should be up and running before the end of this year. Walmart has already tried something similar, though, and ultimately decided to abandon the idea. In June it reported it would be closing all 102 of its so-called “Express” stores. It’s not likely Target will fare significantly better. Even more recently — as in last week — Cornell delivered a clear but concerning message to store workers: “Competition has been fierce and we have had a few bumps on the road this year… We have 137 days to turn this into a winning year… (comparable sales) are flat year-to-date. I’m disappointed with that… we own that.” While it’s not unusual for a company to share ideas and be frank with its employees, it is unusual for Target to do so. Plus, the message seemed to put the onus on in-store workers themselves, who actually have very little control over a customer’s in-store experience. The merchandise selection, staffing levels and foot traffic are out of the most employees’ control. The fact that Cornell would send such a desperate message in the first place — not to mention the unspoken implication — is alarming in itself. Bottom Line for Target Stock Still, does the corporate-sponsored buyback of Target stock bode well? Maybe, but don’t look for a big impact anytime soon. The newly approved $5 billion will only kick in after the current $10 billion buyback program is completed. Just for the record though, it could take a long while for that $10 billion buyback to end. Aside from the fact that Target has only generated $3.1 billion in net income for the past (fairly typical) four quarters, it has also only got $1.5 billion in the bank. And, of the $3 billion or so it earns every year, it has to pay part of that as dividends, and hold into the rest for initiatives like smaller stores, or even just for a rainy day. Skechers USA Inc (SKX) Slammed on Morgan Stanley Downgrade In other words, it could take several years to buy the first $10 billion worth of TGT stock back — never even mind the fact that neither approved buyback program is an actual obligation. Said another way, the buyback announced this week looks more like a public relations move aimed at taking the focus off the retailer’s myriad of problems. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

African-Americans Respect For Authority Starts At Home, Not ‘After’ You’re Shot By Police. September 22, 2016 by Staff   Filed under News, Opinion, Politics, Weekly Columns 3 Comments Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 1 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) People just don’t get it, and I am speaking specifically to blacks. Whether you like authority or not, we are a country based upon a system of laws that are there to protect us all. Accordingly when you have a gun in your hand, behaving in a threatening manner toward law enforcement officers, and the officers tell you to drop the gun, it is in your best interest to do so. There is nothing corrupt about a police officer telling you to drop your gun. But the consequences of not obeying that command can and probably will result in a bad outcome based upon your defiant disobedience.This was the case in the shooting death of Keith Lamont by a Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer. Predictably the outcry was immediate with blacks wasting no time saying the shooting represents the threat blacks live under. In addition to those claims they wasted no time in burning their neighborhoods and looting a Wal-Mart Store, in addition to looting commercial trucks and setting them afire. The shooting was like getting a pony for Christmas to the media; they can bang the drum of cop kills African-American. The only sad thing for them is that the officer who fired in self-defense was black. The police chief is black and the city government is predominantly black. Ergo they will be limited in their ability to argue “white racist cop(s)” killed another African-American. But that will not prevent them from fomenting whatever discord they can. However, these people will never address the brutal truth. The brutal truth is that Lamont is dead because he: A) threatened police with a firearm and B) refused to obey police officers orders that he drop the gun. Blacks, the media, and certainly the rioters do not want to hear the truth – the truth is that Lamont was responsible for his own death. Had he obeyed the command to drop the gun he would be alive today. And he would certainly be alive if he hadn’t been in the street with the gun behaving in a threatening manner. But the truth is a rare commodity these days, unless it serves the narrative of anarchists. Of course it is a tragic occurrence, however it is a tragic occurrence that was entirely avoidable. It is unfortunate that Lamont’s children will grow up without a father and the blame for that must be placed on him. Supposed he had shot and killed a police officer? Would these same people who are now looting and burning buildings mourn the loss of with the policeman’s family? I would say, “not likely.” The message that should come out of this situation is the message that will not be uttered except by someone such as myself; the message is that people (blacks included) must respect and obey law enforcement. As I said; few want to hear the truth but the truth is people wouldn’t be injured and/or killed in these situations if they obeyed the directions of law enforcement. Mine is the least popular view of what took place in Charlotte-Mecklenburg you will hear, but the truth is the truth. And using the belligerent and threatening acts of Lamont, which resulted in his death, as an opportunity to go on a shopping spree, ala looting and stealing, resolves nothing. The burning and looting does show that these blacks are opportunistic vultures without morals and/or respect for authority. Maybe it’s time to start having a conversation about respecting authority juxtaposed to blaming police. However that’s a conversation that won’t take place because to have that conversation, they would need to start with the disrespect these people show their parent(s), teachers, “baby-mammas”, their neighborhoods, themselves, ad nauseum.

Marque Anthony says: September 24, 2016 at 2:58 pm To The Author, your title is correct but lack of respect for authority is no excuse for a police officer to shoot an unarmed black man. You have that twisted. I can say that as a former detective and training instructor. The last thing we need right now is to lecture black people about respect when we are not respected by the police. The police must be both respectful and respectable. That is not happening. Tell both sides please. Ginny says: September 22, 2016 at 9:39 pm So true. So many black males are shot and killed because of their own actions and behavior. That boy didn’t hardly have a book. If he had a book, he may have had enough sense not to be carrying a weapon in the first place. And as usual, none of those outta control blacks will rebuild anything.

REUTERS/Mark BlinchMore By John Tilak CHICAGO (Reuters) - Canada's RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust is looking to invest about C$1.3 billion ($998.62 million) over the next five years in the development and redevelopment of properties in urban markets, its top executive said this week. With the pace of rental rate growth slowing and its acquisition strategy taking a backseat, Canada's biggest REIT has been looking for new ways to expand. RioCan owns about 300 properties across Canada, and its biggest tenants include Loblaw , Canadian Tire , Wal Mart and Cineplex . "We're budgeting C$250 million per year for the next five years," RioCan Chief Executive Edward Sonshine said in an interview on the sidelines of a BMO Capital Markets real estate conference in Chicago. The investment in what RioCan calls urban intensification projects would be a sharp increase from recent years, when the average spending was C$100 million to C$150 million per year, he said. RioCan's expansion strategy calls for transforming some of its assets. This can involve emptying the property, encouraging tenants to leave, tearing down the existing building and constructing new residential, retail or office spaces. "We're adding a lot of residential to our shopping centers. We're intensifying some of the retail, changing the configuration," Sonshine said. "That's where we see the biggest growth." The company's biggest urban intensification project underway is The Well, a roughly 3 million square-foot property in downtown Toronto. A joint venture with Allied Properties REIT and Diamond Corp, The Well will have 1 million square feet of office space, about 500,000 square feet of retail and 1.5 million square feet of residential. The Well is expected to be completed in 2021, Sonshine said. RioCan and Allied own 40 percent each, while Diamond owns the remainder. Other projects include the Yonge Eglinton North East Corner in Toronto, where the total estimated costs are about C$450 million, and King and Portland in Toronto, where the total investment would be about C$220 million, he said. RioCan has partners in both these projects, so its investment would be a part of total costs. RioCan is also pushing into rental residential projects where it could spend, along with partners, "a couple of billion dollars" over a period of "many, many years," Sonshine said. The company recently sold its U.S. operations, a move that helped significantly reduce its total debt to total assets ratio.

(Photo: Provided by Fox59.com.) 123 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Update: Police have identified the victim as 89-year-old Horace Rounds of Indianapolis. Rounds was killed just a week before his 90th birthday. Police are looking for a 1997-98 green Ford Expedition or a 1997-98 Ford F150 truck that is believed to have been involved in the accident. The vehicle will have damage to the front driver's side, including a damaged headlight. Anyone with information is encouraged to call Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Crash Investigations Section at (317) 327-6549 or Crime Stoppers of Central Indiana at (317) 262-8477. Earlier, 4:52 p.m.: Indianapolis police are investigating after a hit-and-run accident left one man dead Thursday morning. Officers were dispatched to the 5500 block of North Michigan Road on calls of a possible deceased man on the side of the road, according to a news release. When officers arrived, they found an elderly man with obvious head trauma. Emergency responders pronounced the man dead at the scene. Investigators think the man left the area Wal-Mart shortly after 6:30 a.m. and was attempting to cross Michigan Road when he was hit by a northbound vehicle, based on the man's injuries and unspecified evidence found at the scene. Police say the driver fled the scene without stopping and providing information or help, which is required by Indiana law. Investigators believe a green vehicle was involved in the incident. The victim has not yet been identified by police. Anyone with information is encouraged to contact Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Crash Investigations Section at (317) 327-6549 or Crime Stoppers of Central Indiana at (317) 262-8477.

Julia Rogers Hook jrhook@thecolumbiastar.com The other day I was going over bills and happened to read my grocery receipt. I almost had a coronary! The way I shop is usually to go pick up a few things during the week and then do one big shop when I have to…although if you listened to my husband Marty, he’d tell you that we could open our OWN grocery store. But I don’t like to run out of things so when I take something out of the pantry, I then replace it on my next shopping trip. It’s a good system and, because it works so well, I sometimes don’t pay as much attention to the details…as in the costs…as I should. But when I was perusing my bill last week my mouth dropped open! Since the last time I bought bacon, which I only buy occasionally these days, the price has almost DOUBLED! I remember being incensed when it went to $5 a pound, but at least then, on a good sale, you got two for one. Not so these days my friends! One package of bacon was almost $10!!!! For ONE pound of it!!! WHEN did that happen? Did the pigs suddenly get an agent or a publicist? I think they got themselves a Union! And so did the cows! A gallon of milk these days will set you back a good five bucks. And that’s the store brand. If you go with the name-brand high-line stuff, you’re talking about $7! I was in the market the other day and remembered I needed light bulbs for my night lights. Now, light bulbs are another thing I stock up on. Marty jokingly tells people my parents must have kept me in the dark without any paper goods because these things are my weakness. You see, I believe when one light bulb goes out, they aaaallll go out. I’ve proved this theory over the years, but Marty still says that we “have more light bulbs than Wal-Mart.” But back to my recent light bulb adventure: I was looking for the tiny little four-watt bulbs that go in a night light. Usually you find the generic brands in a four-pack for about two bucks, and that was what I was looking for. But no. I found a brand name with only two bulbs in them. For $2.79!!!! TWO tiny little bulbs. My “delicate senses” were offended! Not to mention my delicate budget! Now I realize I can be a tad cheap. I love a bargain as much as the next person and when I find one, I’ll stock up. I scan the dollar stores and try to get whatever we might need in any given situation for a good price, but of course, Marty thinks my “inner hoarder” is coming out. But when you can find a dozen toothbrushes for a dollar? Now who can pass that up? Marty can. “Julia, WHY do we have three dozen toothbrushes in my bathroom cabinet?” “For guests, Marty. Sometimes people forget to pack a toothbrush when they travel. This way we’ll have a nice new one ready.” I was preening at my ingenuity and forward thinking. “So you’re telling me the Los Angeles Rams are coming for a sleep-over? Three DOZEN spare toothbrushes… really?” He doesn’t appreciate my ingenuity at all. It’s the same way with paper goods. I NEED to have plenty on hand. I think it stems from my childhood. When I was a little girl, my mother and my grandmother used to have those decorative crocheted tissue boxes in their bathrooms, and I was enthralled with them as a child. I thought they were so pretty sitting there holding the tissues that I would sometimes just pop one out just for the heck of it. But when the box ran low, there was always a tissue ban and it drove me nuts! But, alas, that one lone final tissue was destined to sit in the pretty crocheted box for all time! So today, I need to have lots of backup paper goods in the house. “Julia, for crying out loud, I can’t fit my shaving stuff in the cabinet because of all the toilet paper and Kleenex!” Marty will bellow this out occasionally. So I painstakingly explain (again) my childhood trauma to him and rearrange his grooming tools. He huffs and puffs and sighs and grumbles. “Marty…what if there were an emergency like another flood or a hurricane? Would you want to be without paper goods?” “If there was a flood or a hurricane, I don’t think my first worry would be about paper goods!” One day I’m gonna let him run out of toilet paper and see what happens! He’ll appreciate my resourcefulness then, I bet! I’m just saying… Return to top Tweets by @TheColumbiaStar To advertise with us call 803-771-0219 or email GailT@TheColumbiaStar.com.

News Crime & Courts U.S. Marshals arrest man accused of taking his child from Norfolk to Colorado Arrest and booking photos are provided by law enforcement officials. Arrest does not imply guilt, and criminal charges are merely accusations. A defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty and convicted. Josh ReyesContact Reporter Privacy Policy U.S. Marshals arrested a man accused of taking his child from from Norfolk to Colorado despite not having custody of the child, according to a news release. Marshals found 47-year-old John Francis Rose and the child as they left a Wal-Mart in Colorado Springs on Tuesday about 4:30 p.m., U.S. Marshals spokesman Chris Leuer said. Rose was arrested and his child, who was unharmed, was turned over to child protective services. The child will return to the mother in Norfolk, Leuer said. A felony warrant was issued for Rose on June 21 after he violated a court order regarding custody and visitation, police said. Police said he took his child from the child's mother, who is the legal guardian. Investigators found Rose had left his home in Elizabeth City, N.C. and requested help from the U.S. Marshals. The child was not believed to be in danger. Marshals eventually learned Rose had fled to Colorado, where he was arrested. Rose is being held at the El Paso County Jail in Colorado Springs.

Photographer: Shawn Baldwin/Bloomberg Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp In a small laboratory housed in a biotech incubator 90 minutes east of New York City are six bins tightly packed with sealed plastic bags of men’s dress shirts, sheets, and tufts of cotton ready to be spun into yarn. The materials are waiting to be DNA-tested with the same rigor you’d find in an FBI crime lab. But rather than seeking clues in a murder, the forensic scientists at biotech company Applied DNA Sciences are looking for a unique DNA stamp in the fibers to see whether the textiles are, in fact, made of the premium cotton their labels claim. The products have been sent to Applied DNA Sciences by a group of retailers and manufacturers trying to avoid the fate of Target, which recalled 750,000 fake Egyptian cotton sheets and pillowcases after discovering they contained a less expensive form of cotton. Following Target’s move, Walmart said it would also offer customers refunds on Egyptian cotton sheets made by the same manufacturer, Welspun India. JCPenney and Bed Bath & Beyond are investigating their products. Welspun, which is being sued for consumer fraud in federal courts, said it’s adopting new labeling practices and has hired Ernst & Young to audit its supply process. It’s been an open secret among experts in the cotton industry that products often labeled as 100 percent Egyptian or Pima cotton are made in part or entirely of cheaper cotton. Cotton production in Egypt has tumbled in recent years because of poor management of the seed supply, and in California, drought conditions over the past few years have slashed output of Pima cotton, a premium U.S.-grown plant similar to Egyptian cotton. But demand from consumers for goods made from the expensive fibers—a set of Egyptian cotton sheets can retail for three times the price of those made of common upland cotton—and the desire for ever-lower prices have remained. To keep up, some suppliers have been substituting or blending in cheaper cotton, says James Hayward, Applied DNA Sciences’ chief executive officer. In the case of Pima cotton, 83 percent of tested products labeled as 100 percent Pima were made entirely or partially of another type of cotton, according to a study by the company this year. “Customers want a better and better price, and the retailer applies that same pressure all the way through the supply chain,” says Hayward. “So what do the suppliers do? They cheat.” The results: customers angry that a shirt is rougher than expected or a bedsheet has frayed all too quickly, and retailers at legal risk for false marketing. “This is a bottom-line issue now,” says Nate Herman, a senior vice president for supply chain for the American Apparel & Footwear Association. “Not only have [consumers and retailers] been paying too much for years, it is a brand reputation and a legal liability. Those are the worst things you can have.” In its raw form, Egyptian and Pima cotton feel and look slightly different from coarser upland cotton, and their longer fibers can be seen under a microscope. But once cotton is processed, it’s almost impossible to tell the difference among Egyptian, Pima, and upland varieties even under a microscope, because the long fibers get broken down during weaving, dyeing, and sewing. Sometimes the width of the thread can be used to determine the type of cotton, since upland cotton can’t be spun as thin, according to Cotton Inc., a group representing upland cotton growers. While DNA testing can determine the species of some cottons, there’s currently no test to tell the country where the cotton was grown, the group says. That’s why manufacturers are trying new ways to ascertain that the premium-priced cottons they purchase actually go into the products that reach retailers’ shelves. This year, a handful of retailers started selling cotton that had been marked with a DNA tagging system, similar to what’s been done with olive oil, Super Bowl footballs, and fine art. The technology, developed by Applied DNA Sciences, uses tiny genetic markers that are sprayed on the cotton at the gin just before being packaged and sent to be turned into yarn. The markers bind to the plant’s fibers and act as a microscopic bar code that can be tracked throughout the production process, which can involve more than seven steps in as many countries. At each stop on that journey, samples are collected and sent to Applied DNA Sciences’ lab for testing to ensure the DNA tags are still there and another cotton hasn’t been substituted. In the past year, the microscopic stamps have started to appear on products carried by some of America’s largest retailers. Indian textile manufacturer Himatsingka Group, which makes products sold under the Calvin Klein Home brand at department stores and the Kirkland Signature brand at Costco, started tagging the California Pima cotton in its products in 2014. Bed Bath & Beyond started selling its first DNA-stamped cotton product this year—a down comforter with a Pima cotton lining. “We have arrived at the beginning of a new era when it comes to protecting product integrity,” says Leah Drill, a spokeswoman for Bed Bath & Beyond. At the Applied DNA Sciences lab, run by a molecular biologist who spent most of her career working in medical examiners’ offices, a group of four researchers will test an average of 30 samples a week sent in from clients. Each gets its own case number and a file that can be more than 40 pages long. As demand for tagging and testing has spiked following the Target incident, the company is looking to ramp up its capacity to run 100 samples a day. One reason DNA tagging hasn’t been more widely adopted is because of the expense and complexity, says Herman. While Applied DNA Sciences won’t disclose the exact cost of using its process, the company says the DNA tagging and tracking adds just a “few pennies” per pound to a manufacturer’s expenses. CEO Hayward says the bigger cost increase for apparel makers comes from suppliers charging them more once they’re forced to deliver 100 percent premium cotton. There is “no silver bullet” yet, so retailers are closely tracking only a small fraction of cotton in their products, says Herman. “It has been very difficult. It is just going to take time.” The bottom line: Retailers are using DNA tagging to verify their use of Egyptian cotton, for which sheet sets can run triple the cost vs. regular sets.

Attorneys for Abdul Fatah and Sorihin, who uses one name, say in a lawsuit filed in federal court Thursday that they were recruited in Indonesia seven years ago to work in Hawaii's commercial fishing fleet without realizing they would never be allowed onshore. They have since been issued visas for victims of human trafficking and are living in the San Francisco area. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The lawsuit alleges that San Jose, California, resident Thoai Nguyen, owner and captain of the Sea Queen II, forced Sorihin and Fatah to work up to 20-hour shifts, denied them medical treatment and demanded thousands of dollars if they wanted to leave before their contracts expired. Nguyen did not return calls seeking comment. The lawsuit seeks payment for debts the men incurred, fees they paid and promised compensation but does not specify a value, and asks for unspecified damages for "mental anguish and pain." It comes two weeks after an Associated Press investigation found around 140 fishing boats based in Honolulu, including Sea Queen II, were crewed by hundreds of men from impoverished Southeast Asia and Pacific Island nations. The seafood is sold at markets and upscale restaurants across the U.S. A legal loophole allows them to work without visas as long as they don't set foot on shore. The system is facilitated by the U.S. Coast Guard, as well as Customs and Border Protection who require boat owners to hold workers' passports. AP found some men are paid as little as 70 cents an hour. Others had to use buckets instead of toilets, suffered running sores from bed bugs or sometimes lacked sufficient food. In response, the Hawaii Longline Association representing fishing boat owners has created a universal crew contract that will be required on any boat wanting to sell fish in the state's seafood auction starting Oct. 1. The group says it deplores human trafficking, and that the contract will protect workers. The contracts let owners continue to set their own minimum salaries, allow workers to spend the entire year at sea (15 trips, 10 to 40 days each), and reiterate that they must remain on board with passports held by owners. Cornell University law professor Stephen Yale-Loehr said the new contract "reinforces the current deplorable situation by emphasizing that the crew members have no real rights." "Congress should repeal the loophole that exempts U.S. fishing captains from having to provide basic labor protections to their crew," he said. Here's what Sorihin and Fatah say happened to them. They signed contracts promising $350 a month plus bonuses. They borrowed about $300 to pay an agent in Jakarta. They flew from Jakarta to Singapore, then Sydney, on to Fiji and Pago Pago, American Samoa, an exhausting, 12,500-mile trip. Because docking is inconvenient and potentially costly, the fishermen had to swim from one boat to another before sailing to Honolulu to begin fishing. Then it got worse. One day as Sorihin wrestled a shark onto the Sea Queen, a fishing line got wrapped around his finger, nearly breaking it off. He said his captain set it straight with a chopstick, rubbing ginger and honey on it. Another time a winch cable snapped, cracking Sorihin in his shoulder; swollen and sore, he was allowed a two-hour rest. A swordfish sliced his face as he pulled it aboard, according to the lawsuit. They say the captain was verbally abusive and gave them only torn and worn-out gear. There was new protective gear on the boat but the captain said they would have to pay for it. Both men asked to see a doctor at various times but were told there was no health insurance. "I knew if I stayed on that boat I was going to die," said Sorihin in an interview. » Next page...
