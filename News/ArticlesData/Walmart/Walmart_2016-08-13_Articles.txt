Your commitment to excellence has made the nation’s highways a safer place for everyone.” To clinch the prestigious title of 2016 Bendix Grand Champion, White’s driving skills and knowledge of transportation and truck safety surpassed the over 430 other professional truck drivers competing in Indianapolis this week. White, who also took home the 3-axle class title, lives in nearby Nineveh, Indiana and drives professionally for Walmart Transportation. ATA also recognized Richard Merich as the 2016 Rookie of the Year. Merich took home the honor after a strong performance in the flatbed division. The team of drivers from South Carolina produced the best collective score, with an average of 278.13, and were honored as the top state delegation. Professionalism and dedication to the trucking industry were key themes during the National Truck Driving Championships. Charles Woodland was honored during the awards banquet with the Neill Darmstadter Professional Excellence Award and Chris Ignowski, CDS was chosen as the Lifetime Volunteer Award recipient. ACT 1 served as a premier sponsor of the 2016 National Truck Driving Championships and National Step Van Driving Championships, which took place Aug. 10-13 at the Indiana Convention Center in Indianapolis. Since 2011, Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems has been the sole sponsor of the Bendix National Truck Driving Championships Grand Champion.

Supporters say the acquisition should help Walmart improve its e-commerce business, which has been criticized in the past for falling so far behind Amazon. Walmart's online sales were $13.7 billion in fiscal 2015, while Amazon's sales in 2015 were $107 billion. The deal is also expected to give Walmart access to Jet's shoppers, who tend to be wealthier, younger, and more urban than Walmart's core customers. But some people, like former Sears Canada CEO Mark Cohen, think the acquisition was a waste of money. "I think they just spent $3 billion on an idea that they should have been able to create for themselves," Cohen, now the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School, said in an interview with Business Insider. "It looks and feels like a 'Hail Mary' pass. I think it is a terrible mistake." Jet.com is not yet profitable, but it has grown exponentially — adding approximately 350,000 customers a month — since it launched last year. The company, which sells household goods and groceries, offers lower prices than Amazon and free shipping on all orders over $35. By comparison, Amazon charges $99 annually for free two-day shipping as part of its Prime membership. Jet has a unique business model — enabling customers to bundle items together or waive free-return privileges to save more money — but in Cohen's opinion, it doesn't have "any viability or any likely profitability." "Anyone can offer prices lower than Amazon," but no one has figured out how to do as profitably as Amazon, Cohen said. Some have speculated that the purchase of Jet.com was an expensive way for Walmart to get Jet's founder, Marc Lore, to run Walmart's e-commerce business. View photos Marc Lore QuidsiMore (Jet.com founder Marc Lore.Quidsi) In turn, Walmart could start attracting top tech talent away from Amazon, eBay, and other online retailers, according to UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser. "Until now, Walmart probably faced some difficulty attracting the best & brightest engineers & [e-commerce] talent given its perception as a 'traditional retailer,'" Lasser wrote in a recent note to clients. "We think the addition of a rapidly growing and innovative retailer should enable Walmart to attract human capital and knowledge that it might not have otherwise been able to attain." In announcing the news of the acquisition, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Jet would help Walmart's website grow faster. "Walmart.com will grow faster, the seamless shopping experience we’re pursuing will happen quicker, and we’ll enable the Jet brand to be even more successful in a shorter period of time," he said in a statement. "It’s another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Walmart.” But no one can be sure how it will all play out for Walmart and Jet. "Whether it's the right strategy, or even the right company to acquire, remains to be seen," said Sucharita Mulpuru-Kodali, e-commerce analyst at Forrester Research.

Not any longer. Amazon is the new giant that’s making business models obsolete, and Wal-Mart is among the competitors scrambling to keep up. Instead of superstores and smiley faces, retailing’s new disruptive forces are shop-from-home convenience, ruthless efficiency and $99-a-year video subscriptions. If we needed evidence of the pain Amazon is causing in Bentonville, Ark., we got it Monday when Wal-Mart agreed to pay $3.3 billion for e-commerce startupJet.com. That’s a big price for a company that’s barely a year and a half old and, by its own admission, is at least four years from being profitable. Wal-Mart, hoping to get a boost from Jet’s young customer base and innovative technology, will put Jet founder Marc Lore in charge of all online efforts. Jet’s software, which adjusts prices based on shipping costs, may be its best asset. You get a discount if you live close to where an item is being shipped from, and if you combine items that can easily be shipped in one box. It’s a clever way to reward the most profitable customers, and it has the potential to turn the retailer’s 3,500 supercenters into fulfillment locations. Whether that’s the right strategy is another question. “The biggest problem for the supercenters is driving more traffic,” said Brian Yarbrough, a retail analyst at Edward Jones. “They’re way too big to just turn them into distribution centers.” Yarbrough has a hard time seeing how Wal-Mart can earn much of a return on its $3.3 billion investment. Wal-Mart had $14 billion of online sales last year, about 3 percent of its total, and Jet will add less than $1 billion initially. “The business is not profitable now, and even if you get to profitability you are going to earn lower returns than the overall retail business,” Yarbrough said. Wal-Mart’s first-quarter online sales grew 7 percent, about half the industrywide rate and a quarter of Amazon’s 28-percent growth. Catching up will require more than a nifty pricing algorithm; Amazon locks in customers by offering free shipping once they’ve paid $99 to watch shows such as “Boardwalk Empire.” “Wal-Mart is in a tough position,” Yarbrough say. “They don’t really have anything to distinguish themselves online.” Maybe an entrepreneurial leader can change that, but $3.3 billion is an expensive “acqui-hire.” Lore stayed with Amazon for two years after it bought his diaper-selling startup, Quidsi, in 2012. “I don’t know if this guy is going to want to do this,” says Howard Davidowitz, chairman of retail consulting and investment-banking firm Davidowitz & Associates in New York. “When you have billions in your pocket, you may not want to work for a salary.” Besides, Davidowitz points out, Wal-Mart has made 15 previous e-commerce acquisitions. “They’ve spent more than anyone else and they have the worst results,” he said. “No matter what algorithm they have, this stuff is hard to scale. To believe a midget like Jet is going to compete against Amazon is almost hysterical.” Think back a couple of decades to how Wal-Mart brought Sears, Kmart and hundreds of neighborhood stores to their knees. “Wal-Mart used to be the 800-pound gorilla, and everybody reacted to what Wal-Mart did,” Yarbrough says. “Now the tables are turned and Wal-Mart reacts to what Amazon does.” Wal-Mart may have more money to throw at problems than its old-line competitors did, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to be any more successful at staving off disruption.

This February, after a two-year stint at Wal-Mart Stores in the US, Mediratta returned to India as the managing director and chief executive officer of Metro Cash and Carry India Pvt. Ltd, the local arm of German wholesaler Metro AG, a rival of Wal-Mart. After six months at the helm, Mediratta sat down with the German parent to finalise a five-year strategic plan for India—one of the most important markets for Metro. Arvind Mediratta, 49Mediratta has a B.Tech from IIT Delhi and is an alumnus of IIM Kolkata. He was corporate vice-president (merchandising) at Wal-Mart USA before joining Metro Cash and Carry. He has also worked as chief marketing officer for South Asia at Yum! Foods and at Whirlpool India Ltd. In an interview, Mediratta speaks about how the company is trying to ensure profitable growth so that India can emerge as the largest revenue generator for the German company. Edited excerpts: In March 2015, Metro announced its plan to invest Rs.400 crore to turn India into a focus market and open 50 stores by 2020. What does the new strategic plan entail? There’s a new strategic plan for the next five years for the Indian market. It’s confidential and I will not be able to divulge details. The numbers do not change. We’ll have to deliver the numbers. The revised plan, in a nutshell, is about focusing on maximizing value—how can we get more share of the traders’ wallet, how can we get them more often at our stores. We need to cover more traders with our sales force. It’s about how much more we can get from each store and each customer by enhancing value. We have to open new stores, and get more out of the existing stores. We are standardizing our stores. We have made some changes in our expansion model to make it more viable by making it more cost efficient. The approach for expansion would be cluster based as it is easier to develop and manage the supply chain in a cluster. We may also look at smaller real estate for future stores as one of the options. There will be more focus on people and individual performance. Overall, we need to ensure profitable growth that is sustainable. We’ll be investing in people, stores and technology to ensure our market leadership. Will there be a change in the top level at Metro Cash and Carry India? We are looking at strengthening the team. We’ll get more people on board, essentially at the top level. We’ll have the best talents in the industry in our team. Some of this is likely to happen by end of the year. This business is all about the right people in the right jobs. However, accountability is going to be key. Metro Cash and Carry entered India in 2003, and it had a net loss of Rs.110.72 crore in the fiscal year ended March 2015. Is there a fresh mandate for you to grow faster? Of course. India is one of our priority markets. Priority means growth market. We are right now growing at a very rapid and healthy rate. I can’t share the numbers. We are one of the fastest growing companies. Our base is quite big in terms of revenue. We are going to more than double our business in the next 3-4 years on a big base. Metro has always been very bullish on India. There was never any doubt about the potential that India has. Now we feel it is time to take off. Unlike the initial years, we are now opening stores faster, almost one every two months. Over a period, I think, India can emerge as the largest market for Metro. So, will you open more than 50 stores by 2020? Yes, if we can open more than 50, we will. If we can do 50 by 2019, we’ll do it and we’ll open more stores but as I said earlier, we are not for reckless expansion. We are for profitable expansion. We are talking about thoughtful expansion and it’s going to be aggressive because each store requires Rs.50-60 crore of investment. We want that every store we open is successful. So, we spend a lot of time understanding the trade area. Only then do we enter a city. How many more stores do you think you can open ensuring profitability? Our thumb rule is that we can have one store for every 10 lakh population. At the moment, we are focused on 6-7 big states. The opportunity in existing states is huge, and our expansion is cluster driven. Supply chain is easy to build and manage. We need to saturate a cluster before we open a new one. However, we are also entering new markets. There’s no rocket science in retail or wholesale. What you need is a lot of common sense. Also, we are piloting an online service in Jaipur. In this, traders can order online and get products delivered, typically in 24 hours. The response is good. Over a period, this will contribute significantly to our wallet. Through this, we can actually reach people who may not be within the immediate time zones. So, if you are in one part of the city due to real estate challenges, right now only people near that store—10-15km—can buy. But, once you have people going out and taking orders, delivering and collecting payment, I can expand my catchment to 30-40km. With this, our coverage will intensify. We will also put more sales people on the ground.

Wall Street analysts are looking for earnings declines from both of them. However, one of them is forecast to report a marginal gain on the top line. The retail earnings parade kicked off last week with mixed results from some prominent department store operators offering something for the bulls as well as the bears. Many more retailers are set to share their latest results this week, including big-box store operators Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT). Target When Target shares its fiscal second-quarter results, the Wall Street forecast is that its earnings per share will have shrunk by a dime year-over-year to $1.12 per share, on $16.17 billion in revenue, which would be a more than 7 percent decline. Note that this Minneapolis-based retailer has only bested EPS estimates once in the past three quarters, and then by only a penny. Related Link: Retail Earnings Showdown: Wal-Mart Vs. Target The forecast from 31 Estimize respondents sees EPS from the big-box store operator coming in at $1.15, which is above the midpoint of Target's guidance range of $1.00 to $1.20. Also, the consensus revenue estimate for the three months that ended in July is $16.23 billion. However, Estimize, like Wall Street, overestimated the retailer's revenue in the previous two quarters. Wal-Mart Wall Street's consensus forecast for the world's largest retailer is for per-share earnings to have slipped about $0.06 from the same period of last year to $1.02, though that would be up from the $0.98 posted back in the first quarter. The 64 Estimize respondents are a bit more optimistic, with an consensus estimate of $1.04 per share for the fiscal second quarter, which ended in July. Like Wall Street, Estimize handily underestimated Wal-Mart's revenue back in the first quarter, and this time the respondents are looking for $120.37 billion, which would be only fractionally higher than in the year-ago period. Wall Street is in the same ballpark with its consensus forecast set at $120.34 billion. Wall Street also sees marginal top-line growth in the current quarter, as well as for the full fiscal year. Target is scheduled to report its results before the opening bell on Wednesday, while Wal-Mart is expected to share its quarterly numbers first thing on Thursday. Others In Play Other retailers that Wall Street analysts expect to show at least some earnings growth when they report this week include American Eagle Outfitters, Foot Locker, Home Depot, Lowe's, Ross Stores, Stein Mart, TJX Companies and Urban Outfitters. The EPS at Staples, are anticipated to be about the same as in the year-ago period. The consensus forecasts call for per-share earnings at Advance Auto Parts, Buckle, Dick's Sporting Goods, Gap, Hibbett Sports, L Brands and Stage Stores to have shrunk a year ago. A net loss is in the cards for Children's Place, Citi Trends and Tuesday Morning, if the analysts are correct. The following week, keep an eye out for earnings reports from the likes of Best Buy, Dollar General, GameStop and Tiffany.

Supporters say the acquisition should help Walmart improve its e-commerce business, which has been criticized in the past for falling so far behind Amazon. (Walmart's online sales were $13.7 billion in fiscal 2015, while Amazon's sales in 2015 were $107 billion). The deal is also expected to give Walmart access to Jet's shoppers, who tend to be wealthier, younger, and more urban than Walmart's core customers. But some people, like former Sears Canada CEO Mark Cohen, think the acquisition was a waste of money. "I think they just spent $3 billion on an idea that they should have been able to create for themselves," Cohen, now the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School, said in an interview with Business Insider. "It looks and feels like a 'hail Mary' pass. I think it is a terrible mistake." Jet.com is not yet profitable, but it has grown exponentially — adding approximately 350,000 customers a month — since it launched last year. The company, which sells household goods and groceries, offers lower prices than Amazon and free shipping on all orders over $35. By comparison, Amazon charges $99 annually for free two-day shipping as part of its Prime membership. Jet has a unique business model — enabling customers to bundle items together or waive free return privileges to save more money — but in Cohen's opinion, it doesn't have "any viability or any likely profitability." "Anyone can offer prices lower than Amazon," but no one has figured out how to do as profitably as Amazon, Cohen said. Some have speculated that the purchase of Jet.com was an expensive way for Walmart to get Jet's founder, Marc Lore, to run Walmart's e-commerce business. David McNew/Getty ImagesIn turn, Walmart could start attracting top tech talent away from Amazon, eBay, and other online retailers, according to UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser. "Until now, Walmart probably faced some difficulty attracting the best & brightest engineers & [e-commerce] talent given its perception as a 'traditional retailer,'" Lasser wrote in a recent note to clients. "We think the addition of a rapidly growing and innovative retailer should enable Walmart to attract human capital and knowledge that it might not have otherwise been able to attain." In announcing the news of the acquisition, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Jet would help Walmart's website grow faster.  "Walmart.com will grow faster, the seamless shopping experience we’re pursuing will happen quicker, and we’ll enable the Jet brand to be even more successful in a shorter period of time," he said in a statement. "It’s another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Walmart.” But no one can be sure how it will all play out for Walmart and Jet. "Whether it's the right strategy, or even the right company to acquire, remains to be seen," said Sucharita Mulpuru-Kodali, e-commerce analyst at Forrester Research.

Updated: November 23, 2016 @ 11:53 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go! Life Buy/Sell David Nicklaus - Economy Updates on the economy and what's going on in St. Louis businesses. Wal-Mart spends big but is losing online battle with Amazon By David Nicklaus St. Louis Post-Dispatch David Nicklaus Aug 14, 2016 (…) For a long time, Wal-Mart was the biggest disruptor in the retail industry. Not any longer. Amazon is the new giant that’s making business models obsolete, and Wal-Mart is among the competitors scrambling to keep up. Instead of superstores and smiley faces, retailing’s new disruptive forces are shop-from-home convenience, ruthless efficiency and $99-a-year video subscriptions. If we needed evidence of the pain Amazon is causing in Bentonville, Ark., we got it Monday when Wal-Mart agreed to pay $3.3 billion for e-commerce startup Jet.com. That’s a big price for a company that’s barely a year and a half old and, by its own admission, is at least four years from being profitable. Wal-Mart, hoping to get a boost from Jet’s young customer base and innovative technology, will put Jet founder Marc Lore in charge of all online efforts. Jet’s software, which adjusts prices based on shipping costs, may be its best asset. You get a discount if you live close to where an item is being shipped from, and if you combine items that can easily be shipped in one box. It’s a clever way to reward the most profitable customers, and it has the potential to turn the retailer’s 3,500 supercenters into fulfillment locations. Whether that’s the right strategy is another question. “The biggest problem for the supercenters is driving more traffic,” said Brian Yarbrough, a retail analyst at Edward Jones. “They’re way too big to just turn them into distribution centers.” Yarbrough has a hard time seeing how Wal-Mart can earn much of a return on its $3.3 billion investment. Wal-Mart had $14 billion of online sales last year, about 3 percent of its total, and Jet will add less than $1 billion initially. “The business is not profitable now, and even if you get to profitability you are going to earn lower returns than the overall retail business,” Yarbrough said. Wal-Mart’s first-quarter online sales grew 7 percent, about half the industrywide rate and a quarter of Amazon’s 28-percent growth. Catching up will require more than a nifty pricing algorithm; Amazon locks in customers by offering free shipping once they’ve paid $99 to watch shows such as “Boardwalk Empire.” “Wal-Mart is in a tough position,” Yarbrough say. “They don’t really have anything to distinguish themselves online.” Maybe an entrepreneurial leader can change that, but $3.3 billion is an expensive “acqui-hire.” Lore stayed with Amazon for two years after it bought his diaper-selling startup, Quidsi, in 2012.

Compare pay of top St. Louis executives “I don’t know if this guy is going to want to do this,” says Howard Davidowitz, chairman of retail consulting and investment-banking firm Davidowitz & Associates in New York. “When you have billions in your pocket, you may not want to work for a salary.” Besides, Davidowitz points out, Wal-Mart has made 15 previous e-commerce acquisitions. “They’ve spent more than anyone else and they have the worst results,” he said. “No matter what algorithm they have, this stuff is hard to scale. To believe a midget like Jet is going to compete against Amazon is almost hysterical.” Think back a couple of decades to how Wal-Mart brought Sears, Kmart and hundreds of neighborhood stores to their knees. “Wal-Mart used to be the 800-pound gorilla, and everybody reacted to what Wal-Mart did,” Yarbrough says. “Now the tables are turned and Wal-Mart reacts to what Amazon does.” Wal-Mart may have more money to throw at problems than its old-line competitors did, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to be any more successful at staving off disruption.

Photo by AP By The Associated Press | Friday, Aug. 12, 2016, 10:21 p.m. Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. NEW YORK — The deep-fried Twinkie is jumping from the state fair to the home freezer. Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, began selling packaged deep-fried Twinkies Friday, marking its first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack — in vanilla or chocolate — is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. The Twinkies, which are battered and partially fried before being frozen, need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart. It has a “retro cool factor,” said Ellen Copaken, Hostess' vice president of marketing. “It plays into the comfort food trend. And it's fun.” The Twinkie, long one of Hostess' largest sellers, is a bigger business now than even right before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012, Copaken said. Executives had considered developing a deep-fried version, like those seen at local fairs, but put the plans on hold until Wal-Mart approached them last summer. For Wal-Mart, which gets more than half of its sales from food and other groceries, the partnership is part of a strategy of working closely with suppliers to come up with new twists on existing foods or developing new ones, and getting them to the shelves faster. The company opened a food lab in June for that teamwork, a process that can cut costs and shave months off a product launch, said Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food at Wal-Mart. The food lab at the company's Bentonville, Ark., headquarters has 10 test kitchens and space to accommodate 12 individual taste tests at a time. Specific feedback from customers gathered there gets shared with suppliers to determine whether an item needs more work. Being tested now: new flavors for its store brand sparkling water, frozen stuffed doughnut bites and vacuum-packed Paleo meals. “Most of our customers have a desire to eat healthier,” Redfield said. “But at the end of the day, it has to taste good. Great healthy things that don't taste good don't do well.” Hostess has given a nod to the healthier options, reformulating its Mini Muffins with fruit, no artificial flavors and more whole grains. But the deep-fried Twinkies and candy-topped brownies are among several new treats it hopes will excite shoppers. The vanilla flavor of the deep-fried Twinkies has nine grams of fat and 220 calories, compared with 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie. When baked, deep-fried Twinkies come out a bit crispy, but they aren't an exact match for the ones at fairs or restaurants. “It's really good. It's delicious,” said construction worker Nick Severino of Yonkers, N.Y., who tasted a vanilla cream version. Page Bondor, a Manhattan resident, wasn't excited after trying it. “I like the original Twinkie,” she said. “This is a step too far.” More Business Dow's latest record high shows investor confidence growing Wells Fargo's 'golden parachutes' shackled GM's air bag recall delayed Federal judge blocks rule expanding OT pay Tips can help maximize veterans' GI Bill benefits Subscribe today!

Wed, Nov 23, 2016, 19:04 GMT - UK Markets closed 'I think it is a terrible mistake': Ex-Sears executive says Walmart just wasted $3 billion on Jet.comBy Hayley Peterson | Business Insider – Sat, Aug 13, 2016 19:13 BST Share 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print (David McNew/Getty Images) Walmart's $3 billion purchase of Jet.com has largely been praised as a win for both companies, but not everyone believes it was a good idea. Supporters say the acquisition should help Walmart improve its e-commerce business, which has been criticized in the past for falling so far behind Amazon. Walmart's online sales were $13.7 billion in fiscal 2015, while Amazon's sales in 2015 were $107 billion. The deal is also expected to give Walmart access to Jet's shoppers, who tend to be wealthier, younger, and more urban than Walmart's core customers. But some people, like former Sears Canada CEO Mark Cohen, think the acquisition was a waste of money. "I think they just spent $3 billion on an idea that they should have been able to create for themselves," Cohen, now the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School, said in an interview with Business Insider. "It looks and feels like a 'Hail Mary' pass. I think it is a terrible mistake." Jet.com is not yet profitable, but it has grown exponentially — adding approximately 350,000 customers a month — since it launched last year. The company, which sells household goods and groceries, offers lower prices than Amazon and free shipping on all orders over $35. By comparison, Amazon charges $99 annually for free two-day shipping as part of its Prime membership. Jet has a unique business model — enabling customers to bundle items together or waive free-return privileges to save more money — but in Cohen's opinion, it doesn't have "any viability or any likely profitability." "Anyone can offer prices lower than Amazon," but no one has figured out how to do as profitably as Amazon, Cohen said. Some have speculated that the purchase of Jet.com was an expensive way for Walmart to get Jet's founder, Marc Lore, to run Walmart's e-commerce business. (Jet.com founder Marc Lore.Quidsi) In turn, Walmart could start attracting top tech talent away from Amazon, eBay, and other online retailers, according to UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser. "Until now, Walmart probably faced some difficulty attracting the best & brightest engineers & [e-commerce] talent given its perception as a 'traditional retailer,'" Lasser wrote in a recent note to clients. "We think the addition of a rapidly growing and innovative retailer should enable Walmart to attract human capital and knowledge that it might not have otherwise been able to attain." In announcing the news of the acquisition, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Jet would help Walmart's website grow faster. "Walmart.com will grow faster, the seamless shopping experience we’re pursuing will happen quicker, and we’ll enable the Jet brand to be even more successful in a shorter period of time," he said in a statement. "It’s another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Walmart.” But no one can be sure how it will all play out for Walmart and Jet. "Whether it's the right strategy, or even the right company to acquire, remains to be seen," said Sucharita Mulpuru-Kodali, e-commerce analyst at Forrester Research.

The man, an employee at the Wal-Mart in Helotes, went to work about 6:15 a.m. and returned to the SUV about 3 p.m., where he found his son already dead.  A witness, who saw the baby in the car, called 911 about the same time, KENS5 reports.  Temperatures were around 100 degrees Friday.  Officers found the man banging on the SUV to try to get inside, CBS News reports. They said he was "visibly upset as he was leaning over the infant," the San Antonio Express-News reports.  The baby's grandmother is also an employee at the Wal-Mart and broke down crying in the parking lot, KENS5 reports. The man was cooperative, said Helotes Police Department Capt. Anthony Burgess, until he "locked up," possibly due to shock, the San Antonio paper reports. He was then transported to a hospital for chest pains.  It's unclear if the man will face charges. His name and the name of the baby have not been released.  The death brings 2016's toll of children dying in hot cars to 27, six of them in Texas, said Janette Fennell, founder and president of KidsAndCars.org, a national child safety nonprofit based in Philadelphia.  The toll started sharply rising in the 1990s as more laws were passed that required young children be put in the back seat to avoid air-bag injuries. The change makes it easier for drivers to forget children since they're strapped in the back, Fennell said.  She said parents should get in the habit of opening the back doors after getting out of their vehicles and having their day care call if their child doesn't show up.  The Associated Press contributed to this report.

A seven-month-old boy has died in the United States after being left all day in a hot SUV in a Wal-Mart carpark. The baby's father, who works at the store in the suburb of Helotes in San Antonio, Texas, told police that he forgot to drop his son off at day care before going to work about 6.15am on Friday, local police Captain Anthony Burges said. The father found his child dead after finishing work and returning to the SUV about 3pm. The father was taken to a hospital after reporting chest pains, Burges said. No charges have been filed, and the identities of the father and boy have not been released. READ MORE: * Baby died after two hours in hot car * Device could save babies' lives * Mum left baby in car during strip club audition   Temperatures in the area hovered around 37C much of the afternoon. The death brings the number of children who have died in hot cars in the US this year to at least 27, including six in Texas, said Janette Fennell, founder and president of KidsAndCars.org, a national child safety nonprofit based in Philadelphia. On August 4, twin 15-month-old girls died after being found in the back seat of a hot SUV parked in front of a duplex car Carrollton in northwestern Georgia. When police arrived, they found people holding the girls in the water of a baby pool behind the duplex, some with ice packs, trying to cool the girls off. Last year, there were 15 heatstroke deaths of children in vehicles, Fennell said. Ad Feedback According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and data collected by San Jose State University, the number of children dying of heat stroke in automobiles began to rise following the widespread introduction of passenger-side air bags in the 1990s. An increase in air-bag related fatalities of children in front seats prompted parents to buckle their children in rear seats, but while air bag-related fatalities began to decrease by 2000, the number of children dying of heat stroke rose due to children in back seats being less noticeable to parents and caregivers, according to researchers at San Jose State University. With the children strapped into the back seat, drivers can tend to forget them, Fennell said. Fennell said the numbers of heatstroke deaths of kids in cars fluctuated in the following decades, averaging 37 such deaths a year since 1998. The worst year was 2010, with 49, according to both a count by Fennell and Jan Null, a research meteorologist at San Jose State University, who also tracks numbers. The temperature inside a parked car on a 90-degree day will reach 48C in 20 minutes and 56C after an hour, Null said. Parents should get into the habit of always opening their back doors when they leave the vehicle, according to Fennell. Leaving a purse or cellphone in the back seat can help. Parents also need to make sure their day care calls them if the child doesn't show up, she said.  - AP Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next Americas story: Acrobatics by 'Fit Grandpa' on Rio de Janeiro's metro stun onlookers heading to Olympics World Homepage world headlines Fake cop car stopped by actual cops 23-year-old in charge of purge MP killer gets life Heinz beans advert banned 'He was a gentle giant' Overstaying guests shot by host Police officer shot on duty UK serial killer convicted Pilot strike causes havoc Teen's powder tests 'negative' Fatal water ride to close Dalai Lama: No Trump worries MP's tearful domestic violence plea 'IM GOD' plate rejected 'There were hundreds, at least 200' Ad Feedback Most popular Viewed Shared Commented Salmon die suddenly after being released for Fish and Game event Teen burglars take $42,000 in goods in Raglan ram raid, sell online IRD Wellington headquarters closed over suspected quake-struck stairwell Hortense the huntsman's letterbox nursery is a web sensation A woman was angry her houseguests wouldn't leave - so she started shooting at them, police say Online laptop sale ends in robbery Women cheat on men who don't do house chores - survey Michael Phelps explains why he was secretly married before the Rio Olympics Australian teen released as powder tests 'negative' in Bali, says lawyer Bubbling phenomenon in Kaikoura could signal attraction for tourists and scientists Hortense the huntsman's letterbox nursery is a web sensation IRD Wellington headquarters closed over suspected quake-struck stairwell Legend not just living on, but alive and well Salmon die suddenly after being released for Fish and Game event GeoNet posts video showing the uplift of Kaikoura's coastline Dom Harvey: 'Running marathons saved my life' Henderson interests buy Sol Square A grim warning to baby boomers Women cheat on men who don't do house chores - survey What went wrong with Civil Defence's earthquake and tsunami response, and how can we fix it? special offers Ad Feedback National World Business Technology Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Stuff.co.nz About Us | Contact Us | View Mobile Site Subscribe Text | Follow us on Facebook and Twitter | Newspapers | Magazine subscriptions | RSS - Top Stories Services Stuff Fibre | Newspapers in Education | A-Z Directories | Online Advertising | Print Advertising | Careers Classifieds Death Notices | Celebrations | Trade Me | Jobs | Property | Motors | Accommodation | Personals | Newspaper Classifieds Newspapers Dominion Post | The Press | Waikato Times | Auckland Now | Sunday News | Sunday Star-Times   Marlborough Express | Manawatu Standard | Nelson Mail | Southland Times | Taranaki Daily News | Timaru Herald Other Sites Essential Mums | Cuisine | NZ House & Garden | NZ Fishing News | NZ Life & Leisure | NZ Gardener | Fairfax Archives Breaking news?

vator vatorX vatornews Register Log in Newsroom Innovation series Interviews Lessons learned Trends & news Weekly M&A Roundup M&A roundup - week ending 8/13/16 Palantir bought Silk; Randstad acquired Monster; Walmart purchased Jet Innovation series by Steven Loeb August 13, 2016 | Comments Short URL: http://vator.tv/n/46bd Palantir, a provider of a suite of software applications for integrating and analyzing data, acquired data publishing platform Silk. No financial terms of the deal were disclosed.  The Silk team would be coming to work at Palantir in an unspecified capacity. Going forward, the Silk platform will continue to operate in its current capacity, but it will no longer be updated. It will not provide technical or customer support to new or existing Silk accounts any longer, nor will it be doing any further development work or adding new features to the hosted Silk.co product.

(CBC) Sophia Harris Business reporter sophia.harris@cbc.ca Sophia Harris has worked as a CBC video journalist across the country, covering everything from the start of the annual lobster fishery in Yarmouth, N.S., to potash prices in Saskatchewan. She now has found a good home at the business unit in Toronto where she produces for national TV news and writes and shoots and edits video for CBC.ca.

She's loading up for a family road trip and chose to do it at Walmart. "Easier for me, one shot deal," she explains. Martins says she's at Walmart almost every week and always picks up some type of food item — from snacks to spicy Thai-flavoured tuna. "It's hard to find in some places. They always have it here and it's always a good price." Walmart is on a mission to become Canada's top grocer says a food policy expert. (CBC) More Canadians are turning to the big box giant for at least some of their food shopping. And that's helping U.S.-based Walmart take a big bite out of the traditional grocery store market. "It's comfortable, good prices," says Castor Sousa, who divides his grocery shopping between Walmart and the neighbourhood supermarket. High food prices driving some shoppers away from fruits, vegetables study says Food prices set to rise in 2016 as weak loonie takes a bigger bite Walmart's share of the grocery store pie could grow even bigger, predicts Sylvain Charlebois, a professor at Dalhousie University specializing in food distribution and policy. He says the retail chain's mission is to become Canada's number 1 food retailer, a feat it has already achieved in the U.S. "Based on the pace that they currently have, it is an achievable goal." Walmart gains ground Walmart Canada's same-store sales have continually grown over the past eight quarters. And food sales at general merchandise stores — where Walmart and Costco dominate — continue to grow faster than sales at traditional supermarkets. Food-industry analyst Kevin Grier crunched the numbers from Statistics Canada. He found that the dollar value of food sales from grocery stores increased by two per cent in the first quarter of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. That's at a time when overall food price inflation rose by 4.5 per cent.   However, food sales from general merchants jumped by 11 per cent. Loblaws gears up for grocery price war in a low-inflation environment Shoppers Drug Mart enters grocery wars, armed with fresh fruit and fish Grier also found that those growth figures have remained fairly consistent over the previous five years. Grocery store sales are still higher than general merchant food sales, but that the gap keeps shrinking, he says. "It's astounding," says Grier, with Kevin Grier Market Analysis and Consulting in Guelph, Ont. "The data tells me Walmart and Costco are doing a fantastic job in terms of generating food sales." Walmart's traditional strategy is to compete on price, an approach it takes in grocery as well as in consumer and household goods. "Walmart Canada's mission is clear — we want to save Canadians money to help them live better," a Walmart spokeswoman said in response to a request for comment from CBC News. Can Walmart surpass Costco? According to CIBC Institutional Equity Research estimates, Costco has 10 per cent of the Canadian food market, and Walmart has seven per cent. But Charlebois predicts that Walmart will eventually come out ahead. He says U.S.-based Costco has done an impressive job enticing shoppers by offering them deals on buying in bulk. But the professor says a bulk-based retailer can only grow by so much. 'Ten to 15 years ago, the design of the store wasn't very appealing for food' - Sylvain Charlebois, food policy expert "You do eliminate a great deal of the market when you need a car, you also need space at home, and you need a large freezer." Charlebois also points to Walmart's efforts to woo grocery shoppers with more than just the promise of low prices. "Ten to 15 years ago, the design of the store wasn't very appealing for food," he says. "When you walked into a Walmart, you almost had to feel desperate to buy anything." He says that has changed now that the retailer's supercentres have adopted a layout similar to a traditional grocery store. "It is clearly deliberate. I think people want to buy food when they feel they're in a certain environment." At the Toronto Walmart CBC News visited, fresh fruits and vegetables are displayed on the periphery of the grocery section, just like in a traditional supermarket. Bunches of bananas and tubs full of oranges and apples greet shoppers as they enter the store. Walmart superstores have adopted a grocery layout similar to a traditional supermarket with fresh fruit and vegetables on the periphery. (CBC) Although Walmart's grocery section is typically not as large as a big-box supermarket, the offerings are varied — from Halal meats to pre-cut fruit platters. Consumers change shopping habits Megan Bell says she only started grocery shopping at Walmart a year ago. "I was a bit leery in the past. And I would just buy certain things there, but never groceries." However, that has changed. She has discovered she likes the retailer's Italian bread and finds the fruits and vegetables are fresh, especially the cherries she bought on a previous trip. "They're nice, fat. And, I'm telling you, almost every one in the bag was good." Walmart has expanded the number of supercentres that offer groceries, now making up about 300 of its more than 400 stores in Canada. It's also ramping up its efforts to sell groceries online. "Our e-commerce business [in Canada] ... continued to grow nicely with the expansion of online grocery in the Greater Toronto Area," Walmart chief financial officer Brett Biggs said during a conference call in May.     Walmart says it plans to ban Visa at its more than 400 stores across Canada. (CBC) Charlebois notes that traditional grocers are also upping their game to compete. Grocery price war Loblaw, Canada's largest grocer, is currently embroiled in a price war with its suppliers to lower costs and pledges to pass on lower prices to consumers. It is also expanding into urban markets with smaller stores and by selling fresh food at many of its Shoppers Drug Mart locations. Charlebois says Loblaw continues to innovate with its line of President's Choice products and Sobeys with its focus on fresh food. But the battle for your grocery dollar remains tight. Industry analyst Grier notes that, according to Statistics Canada, Canadians are not spending more on food. "We've been flat-lining," he says. And while Walmart's forte may not be innovative new products, says Charlebois, there is one thing it has excelled at: "stealing [market share] from other players."

To make sure she’s getting the best deal on her groceries for her and her husband, the New Westminster pensioner puts on her sturdy walking shoes and makes a day of it. “I go around and I check every little store, what they have for me and for what price,” she says. “If you don’t do that, your grocery bill, it will be a big one. This way, I save me quite a bit of money.” Bottarel’s weekly shopping trips got easier recently with the opening of a Walmart Supercentre, which sells groceries as well as general merchandise, at Royal City Centre, right above the Save On Foods. It’s this choice, and the proximity of retail grocery options, that has Bottarel and thousands of other Metro Vancouver consumers blessed with a bounty of outlets. “I check the meat upstairs (at Walmart) and I’m going to check it in there (Save On Foods) and then I check the Buy-Low. I check everything and then I go back and check the better price and I buy it,” says Bottarel, who also periodically looks in at Galloway’s, a specialty independent store across the street, Kin’s Farm Market in the mall and the Safeway several blocks away. “When I get tired, I sit down someplace and then I start again.” Save On may be her favourite, but Bottarel is grateful for Walmart when she’s on the hunt for the best price. “If we don’t have competition things are going to go up again and we don’t need that. Some people are a millionaire, but I’m not. I got to watch every penny where it goes. I was very thankful when Walmart came in.” ‘I check every little store, what they have for me and for what price,’ New Westminster pensioner Vera Bottarel says of her approach. ‘If you don’t do that, your grocery bill, it will be a big one. This way, I save me quite a bit of money.’ ‘WALMART EFFECT’ That an increasing share of the grocery market going to non-traditional retailers like Walmart Supercentres and Costco Wholesale is causing deflation in food prices after they spiked above inflation in 2014 and 2015. It’s particularly evident in B.C. and Quebec. Still, our smaller grocery bills may be a case of short-term gain but long-term pain if the industry further consolidates to increase margins, leaving consumers with fewer choices and eventually higher prices. Some analysts say Canadians should get ready for a grocery price war, thanks to oversaturation in the market, with the traditional stores beefing up their discount brands to head off the non-traditional discounters. Sylvain Charlebois calls it the “Walmart effect,” and says it’s most pronounced in B.C. and in Quebec. “Quebec and B.C. are where prices are dropping the most and that’s where Walmart and Costco have become more aggressive,” says the professor in food distribution and policy at Dalhousie University in Halifax. Food prices dropped in the Consumer Price Index in B.C. by 0.5 per cent from May to June this year, according to Statistics Canada. The overall inflation rate for consumer goods in B.C. in June was 1.5 per cent. Most significantly, the price of beef in Canada dropped 3.3 per cent in June over June 2015, the first year-over-year decrease since August 2010, and dairy products were 2.1 per cent less in the same period. In contrast, consumers were paying hikes of four to five per cent in grocery prices in 2014 and 2015, which outpaced inflation, says Charlebois. At the time Walmart was expanding and adding fresh products to its stores to compete against Target stores, a threat that never materialized when the U.S. chain pulled out of Canada. That left Walmart in a better position to compete against the traditional stores, says Charlebois. “To Loblaw, Walmart is clearly a threat,” he says. Eight of the 13 stores Walmart bought from Target last year were in B.C. and Quebec, and “Costco has opened quite a few new outlets,” he adds. Loblaw Cos. Ltd. this summer sent a letter to its suppliers, requesting they drop their prices by 1.45 per cent in their shipments beginning in September. And United Grocers, the buying group for a number of Loblaw’s competitors (including Overwaitea Food Group and the food division of London Drugs), sent a letter to the same suppliers, insisting the same price cut, if any, that they grant to Loblaw. “We should expect to be treated competitively,” says United Grocers president Denis Gendron. If the suppliers give cuts to Loblaw, he says, they would expect the same because “our goal is to give our customers the best prices available.” Suppliers have told Gendron the issue is “under review.” But, he adds, “we’re not expecting the suppliers to come to us and say we’ve decided to reduce our prices.” The industry is feeling the pressure from Walmart Supercentres and from Costco, says Gendron, but that’s not new. “And if it weren’t them, it would be someone else.” ‘MORE STORES THAN NECESSARY’ Food retailing is big business and players want as much of the pie as they can get. The average B.C. household spends about $8,200 a year, or almost $700 a month, on food, according to Statistics Canada. About $5,700 is food purchased from stores, and almost $2,500 from restaurants. Walmart and Costco are having a growing impact on the industry, once comfortably held by traditional grocers. In 2015, the traditional grocery retailers’ share of the Canadian food market had dropped to 78 per cent, down from 84 per cent five years earlier. And between 2004 and 2015, food sales at general merchandisers grew at a rate of almost 12 per cent a year, according to StatsCan, while the grocery stores grew at three per cent a year. Moreover, drug stores’ sales of food jumped in the first quarter of 2106, up 14 per cent over the same quarter last year. London Drugs (owned by the same family that owns IGA) and Shoppers Drug Mart (bought last year by Loblaw) sell food, including limited dairy, which adds to the competition. Walmart Canada has captured seven per cent of the food retail market and Costco has 10 per cent. Rob Gerlsbeck, editor of Canadian Grocer, says the expansion into groceries in 2014 and 2015 by Walmart, Costco and Target resulted in “more stores than was necessary for the population growth.” He says that oversaturation will likely continue to keep pressure on prices because the grocery square footage was growing at three to four per cent while Canada’s population grows at one per cent a year. “I don’t want to call it a price war, but you’ll see the stores try to convince shoppers to spend money at their stores over other stores for their weekly groceries,” he says. “Walmart’s operating procedures has been low prices — that’s what they hammer and they’re very good at it.” Such an approach has recent roots, he adds. Since the 2008 economic crash “consumers have been shopping more at discount stores and they have continued to be more price conscious.” ‘RELENTLESS PRESSURE’ The parent companies have responded by opening up more discount brands, Loblaw is expanding No Frills while Sobey’s has plans to convert remaining Price Choppers into FreshCo. discount outlets. “The choices we have as Canadians is incredible,” says food industry analyst Kevin Grier, who publishes the Grocery Trade Review. “We have lots of competition and huge choice and low-cost food because our grocers are good at what they do.” If Walmart’s approach proves successful, he says, “it’s because Canadians have chosen out of their own self-interest where they want to shop.” Like shopper Rebecca Kapsalis, who says recently outside New Westminster’s Walmart Supercentre: “I prefer Walmart because Walmart has the big savings. You get better quality food at a reasonable price, and I love Walmart. I am so happy that we finally got it here.” That’s not a unanimous sentiment. New Westminster resident Scott Pillsbury points out: “I’m not happy to see Walmart moving in, but if it lowers prices, it’s a good thing. “It’s better to support local products, so I would pay a price for that. I’m not saying I would pay any price for that, but I would pay a little bit more to support something local.” David Ian Gray, of Vancouver’s DIG360 Consulting, says demanding lower prices from suppliers isn’t new — “Walmart is known for grinding suppliers” — and he and others say only time will tell if it’s successful. Price wars in the short run are good for consumers, he says, “but in the long run it’s hard to maintain quality and choice in the face of this relentless pressure. The pressure could really squeeze those without scale,” which is why smaller chains like Choices Market need to differentiate with organics and specialty items. “Consumers do want to have some choice,” says Gray. “Over time you start seeing the big guys getting bigger and it starts to be a harder game to play.” slazaruk@postmedia.com Twitter.com/SusanLazaruk B.C.’s grocery shelf: Who owns what • Overwaitea Food Group is Canada’s largest western-based food store chain.

Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, launched packaged “Deep Fried Twinkies” on Friday, marking its first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack in vanilla or ­chocolate is the result of a yearlong ­collaboration between Hostess and Walmart, as the companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They’ll cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Walmart. It has a “retro cool factor,” says Ellen Copaken, Hostess’ vice ­president of marketing. “It plays into the ­comfort food trend. And it’s fun.” The Twinkie, long one of ­Hostess’ largest sellers, is a bigger ­business now than even right before the ­company filed for bankruptcy in 2012, Copaken said. Executives had considered developing a deep-fried version, such as those seen at local fairs, but put the plans on hold until Walmart approached them last summer. For Walmart, which gets more than half of its sales from food and other groceries, the partnership is part of a strategy of working closely with suppliers to come up with new twists on existing foods or developing new ones, and getting them to the shelves faster. The company opened a food lab in June for that teamwork, a process that can cut costs and shave several months off a product launch, says Charles Redfield, ­executive vice president of food at Walmart. The food lab at the company’s Bentonville, Ark., headquarters has 10 test kitchens and space to accommodate 12 individual taste tests at a time. Specific feedback from customers gathered there gets shared with suppliers to determine whether an item needs more work. Being tested now: new flavors for its store brand sparkling water, frozen stuffed doughnut bites, and vacuum-packed Paleo meals. “Most of our ­customers have a desire to eat healthier,” Redfield said. “But at the end of the day, it has to taste good. Great healthy things that don’t taste good don’t do well.” Hostess has given a nod to the healthier options, reformulating its Mini Muffins with fruit, no artificial flavors and more whole grains. But the Deep Fried Twinkies and candy-topped brownies are among several new treats it hopes will excite shoppers. At 9 grams of fat and 220 calories, the vanilla flavor of the Deep Fried Twinkies compares to 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie. One expert says Americans still like a sugar fix, typically at the end of the day. “We are trying to cut down on foods that are higher in sugar content,” said Darren Seifer, a food industry analyst at market research firm NPD Group Inc. “But there is still room for indulgence.” Twinkies have been around since 1930, but the company’s ­financial woes had put their future in doubt. Hostess products came back after the company was bought in 2013 for $410 million. U.K. expat ­Christopher Sell added a deep-fried Twinkie to the menu at his Chip Shop restaurant in Brooklyn about 15 years ago, and the idea took off at state fairs. Hot-dog chain Papaya King in New York sells them for $3 each, excluding tax, and they’re faring better than the deep-fried Oreos. “We wanted to do a sweet and savory combo,” Papaya chain President Wayne Rosenbaum said. “The Twinkies seem to be the most popular.” Hostess hoped to recreate the state fair staple, but it wasn’t easy. The company tested ­prototypes at its Kansas City, Mo., headquarters, and considered making it a restaurant product. Then Walmart approached them. Executives at Hostess, which also has an office near Walmart’s headquarters in Arkansas, came to Walmart, and cooked in the kitchen with them. “The original samples were pretty good,” said John Pearson, Walmart’s senior buyer for frozen foods. “But the batter was a little lumpy.” Hostess wanted a baking time of less than 10 minutes, with the right amount of oozing filling and a crispy texture. Then there was the name. Hostess considered Carnival Twinkie, Boardwalk Twinkie and the Light and Crispy Twinkie. But Pearson and other Walmart executives encouraged Hostess to call them what they are: Deep Fried Twinkies. When baked, the Deep Fried Twinkies do come out a bit crispy, but aren’t an exact match for the ones at fairs or restaurants. “It’s really good. It’s delicious,” said construction worker Nick Severino of Yonkers, N.Y., who tasted a vanilla cream version. Page Bondor, a Manhattan resident, wasn’t excited after trying it. “I like the original Twinkie,” she said. “This is a step too far.” What sets the Hostess version apart, Copaken says, is the ease. “We eliminated the hard work and prep,” she said. More Business articles » A look at deep-fried Twinkies How it’s made: A regular Twinkie is coated with a cake funnel batter and then proceeds through an oil bath to ensure the batter adheres. The Twinkies are immediately frozen and packaged. Home preparation: Pull it out of the freezer and bake it for six to eight minutes in the oven at 350 degrees. You can also use a toaster oven at 350 degrees for eight to 10 minutes, or deep fry them for 21/2 to 3 minutes. The price: $4.76 per box of seven. For comparison, hot-dog joint Papaya King, based in New York, sells its own fresh deep-fried treats for $3 each, excluding tax. Distribution: The Deep Fried Twinkies went on sale Friday at Walmart, and will be sold by the retailer exclusively for three months. After that, the treats will be available at other stores. Ellen Copaken, vice president of marketing at Hostess, says the frozen Twinkie could be marketed abroad. Nutrition: The vanilla cream version has 220 calories, 9 grams of fat and 16 grams of sugar. A regular Twinkie has 130 calories, 4 grams of fat and 14 grams of sugar. In comparison, a Starbucks Carmel Frappuccino has 420 calories, 15 grams of fat and 66 grams of sugar. Working it off: A person who weighs about 150 pounds would need to run for 20 minutes at 10 mph, take a 40-minute spin class or do a 50-minute bike ride, says Amy Gorin, a registered dietitian-nutritionist based in Jersey City, N.J. Limited-time Twinkies: In December, Hostess teamed up with Walmart on a limited-time mint-chocolate flavored cake. In June, it worked with the retailer on a tie-in for the new “Ghostbusters” movie, creating Key Lime Slime Twinkies for a short-term sale.     RG Daily Digest Get our top headlines delivered to your inbox.         Today’s Business stories Business Harvesters round up cranberries from bogs for Thanksgiving tables Jobs Lane County jobless rate drops slightly in October Business Court blocks overtime rule Business Tired of travel fees?

Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, is launching packaged “Deep Fried Twinkies” starting Friday that mark its first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They’ll cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart. It has a “retro cool factor,” says Ellen Copaken, Hostess’ vice president of marketing. “It plays into the comfort food trend. And it’s fun.” The Twinkie, long one of Hostess’ largest sellers, is a bigger business now than even right before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012, Copaken said. Executives had considered developing a deep-fried version, like those seen at local fairs, but put the plans on hold until Wal-Mart approached them last summer. For Wal-Mart, which gets more than half of its sales from food and other groceries, the partnership is part of a strategy of working closely with suppliers to come up with new twists on existing foods or developing new ones, and getting them to the shelves faster. The company opened a food lab in June for that teamwork, a process that can cut costs and shave several months off a product launch, says Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food at Wal-Mart. The food lab at the company’s Bentonville, Ark., headquarters has 10 test kitchens and space to accommodate 12 individual taste tests at a time. Specific feedback from customers gathered there gets shared with suppliers to determine if an item needs more work. Being tested now: new flavors for its store brand sparkling water, frozen stuffed doughnut bites, and vacuum-packed Paleo meals. “Most of our customers have a desire to eat healthier,” Redfield said. “But at the end of the day, it has to taste good. Great healthy things that don’t taste good don’t do well.” Hostess has given a nod to the healthier options, reformulating its Mini Muffins with fruit, no artificial flavors and more whole grains. But the Deep Fried Twinkies and candy-topped brownies are among several new treats it hopes will excite shoppers. At nine grams of fat and 220 calories, the vanilla flavor of the Deep Fried Twinkies compares to 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie. One expert says Americans still like a sugar fix, typically at the end of the day. “We are trying to cut down on foods that are higher in sugar content,” said Darren Seifer, a food industry analyst at market research firm NPD Group Inc. “But there is still room for indulgence.” Twinkies have been around since 1930, but the company’s financial woes had put their future in doubt. Hostess products came back after the company was bought in 2013 for $410 million. U.K. expat Christopher Sell added a deep-fried Twinkie to the menu at his Chip Shop restaurant in Brooklyn about 15 years ago, and the idea took off at state fairs. Hot-dog chain Papaya King in New York sells them for $3 each, excluding tax, and they’re faring better than the deep-fried Oreos. “We wanted to do a sweet and savory combo,” Papaya chain president Wayne Rosenbaum said. “The Twinkies seem to be the most popular.” View Comments 0 Most Read White nationalist Richard Spencer to speak at Texas A&M next month | All Ablog Austin Burnet County judge's social media response to San Antonio cop slaying Travel alert: Austin airport's Lot A, long-term parking full Things To Do Add Event + See More Weather and Traffic 65 78702 44 Most Read White nationalist Richard Spencer to speak at Texas A&M next month | All Ablog Austin Burnet County judge's social media response to San Antonio cop slaying Travel alert: Austin airport's Lot A, long-term parking full Things To Do Add Event + See More More from statesman.com Topics News Sports Austin360 Ahora Si Neighborhoods Things To Do News Season for Caring: Where are they now?

News Entertainment Love & Sex Style Mind & Body Share < br />this article: It’s Too Ironic That Walmart Is Selling Prints Of Banksy’s Anti-Capitalism Art Karen Fratti @karenfratti | 8.12.16 | 7:43 pm Share < br />this article: CREDIT: Andrew Burton /Getty Images Oy vey. Those are the only two words I have for Walmart selling anti-capitalism Banksy prints in its stores. Because this is the kind of shit that’s not really dangerous, per se, but is just totally fucking ridiculous. It’s so American, like McDonald’s hamburgers that won’t get moldy, yet no one seems to give a flying fuck that everyone continues to eat them. Walmart corporate buyers are some crafty mofos. Because street art is cool, right? And Banksy is cool, right? And since art copyright laws are so totally cool (they are not, by the way) that the famous graffiti artist doesn’t hold any rights to his well-known images, Walmart can do whatever the fuck it wants with them. What’s particularly amazing about this scenario is that Walmart didn’t choose just any Banksy print — the giant company chose the “Destroy Capitalism” one and is selling it for $60 online. Free shipping, bitches. Of course, like any good economic market, one can also buy the very same print on Amazon for $40 bucks a pop. Decisions, people, decisions. Walmart has been doing this since 2013, but after news organizations started calling the franchise out for “counterfeit” prints, it stopped selling them from third parties. But it looks like Walmart’s back at it now that the dust has settled. Hey Walmart is selling Banksy Destroys Capitalism wall art for only $66.99! What a steal! https://t.co/aE53cCOKSZ pic.twitter.com/jyDPPmaT4z — Josh Cox (@j0shc0x) August 1, 2016 It’s ironic and funny in an “oh my god art is dead and so is my soul” sort of way. Sure, Banksy is always a little obvious, which is why it’s a good fit for Walmart. Soon, “hip” families can start putting up “edgy” street art in their homes, bought from Walmart, alongside those Pottery Barn wall hangings that say “Eat” and “Love.” It means nothing. Walmart exemplifies everything wrong with capitalism: it gets tax breaks, treats employees like shit, and sells shitty things at low costs. And now it sells anti-capitalism art, too. In 2013, Walmart was also selling a counterfeit piece by L.A. street artist Eddie Colla, who took action. He told LA Weekly at the time: “Things are just getting picked up and reproduced and the artists aren’t seeing any money out of that… Walmart has a long history of unfair business practices and employment policies. Last month employees were organizing food drives for other employees for Thanksgiving. If Walmart had contacted me for a licensing deal, there’s not a dollar amount that exists that I would have done it for.” There’s actually nothing left to be done about a major, pretty evil retailer selling anti-capitalist prints stolen from an artist except laugh. Or cry. Pick your poison.

It’s about a private Michigan company called Ranir, which makes, among other things, the business end of electric toothbrushes. After spending two years and millions of dollars to re-engineer its toothbrush heads, Ranir brought back fully one-fifth of that production from China to its facility in Grand Rapids. It’s precisely the kind of thing that both Clinton and Trump, with varying degrees of emphasis and policy prescriptions, have pledged to accelerate as a way to cure America’s blue-collar woes. Using tougher trade policies with China and others to restore the nation’s manufacturing sector will bring home jobs, the theory goes. Ranir’s experience appears to back up such assumptions at first blush. After all, now it is American workers who are busy around the clock churning out 13,000 toothbrush heads a day for Wal-Mart, Walgreens and other retailers. There’s just one catch: Thanks to the new robotic manufacturing process that Ranir adopted, it takes only four workers at the American plant to do the same job that almost certainly required dozens more in China. And they spend much of their time watching to make sure the computer-driven machines are working properly. Instead of the clang and bustle of a traditional plant, the four workers go about their chores in a clean-room setting, wearing large white protective hats. So what the Ranir story actually shows is not how easy it would be to bring back manufacturing jobs, but how small the results can be, thanks largely to the very thing that made the return possible: automation. “It sounds appealing. It sounds like an easy solution. You close borders or impose tariffs, and magically you get jobs popping back up,” said Brad Hershbein, economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, referring to protectionist policies such as those proposed by Trump. But that’s just not going to happen, he said. “We’ll probably continue to see flatlining of employment or it declining,” Hershbein said. There are many reasons to question whether tougher trade policies alone will bring back U.S. manufacturing jobs to their past levels. Some manufacturers would respond to tariffs and other protectionist policies by simply moving existing overseas jobs to other countries, rather than back to the U.S. Other powerful forces working against large-scale increases in U.S. manufacturing jobs include regulatory costs and an absence of suppliers in the U.S. But even if manufacturing did return, the jobs may not, thanks to advancing technology. Arnold Kamler, whose family has been in the bicycle business for a century, never thought he would make anything in the U.S. again after he tearfully shut the doors to his New Jersey plant in 1991. Like all onetime domestic bike makers, including better-known firms like Huffy and Schwinn, Kamler’s company, Bicycle Corporation of America, turned entirely to manufacturers abroad or it buys foreign-made bikes to supply to the U.S. market. But two years ago, Kamler brought back a small share of production from China to a rural corner of South Carolina. He was prodded by Wal-Mart’s “Made in America” campaign and the realization that China’s best manufacturing days were over. Annual employee turnover at his factory outside Shanghai today is more than 120 percent. But automation also made it more feasible to return the work to the U.S. This year, Kamler will make almost 300,000 bikes in Manning, S.C., about as many as he produced domestically in 1991. His company operates with about a third fewer employees than it needed back then. With 4,000 feet of overhead conveyors and the latest wheel-building equipment, his 115 employees assemble bikes at a rate that would require twice as many workers in China. Those are indeed new American jobs, but the pay scale is modest — they earn $11 to $12 an hour to start, plus health insurance, 75 percent employer-paid — not quite the renaissance sometimes suggested by the presidential candidates. And Kamler still imports 2.6 million bikes a year from China. Its South Carolina manufacturing won’t be profitable for at least another couple of years. Even as he expands his production volume and capabilities in the U.S., he doesn’t foresee large increases in employment. Next year, Kamler plans to go to 450,000 bikes in South Carolina, a 50 percent increase. But the company may add only 30 workers. He also is investing in a state-of-the-art painting operation and wants to make his own aluminum rims rather than importing them. He recalled how in 1991, bike rims were made completely by hand, first cut, then welded, buffed down and finally holes punched in them before being sent for painting or chrome-plating. Today, he says, a new and expensive Dutch-made system can take 20-foot sections of aluminum and churn out a finished rim in about 90 seconds. For that, the company would need only one operator, just to make sure that the machines don’t jam. “It’s so automated, it’s inspiring,” he said of bike manufacturing today. Some economists think the U.S. could bring back as many as 2 million factory jobs by eliminating the country’s merchandise trade deficit, which hit a record $745 billion last year, half with China. But it is not that simple. “Hiring someone is kind of the last thing you do because it’s a potentially long-term commitment,” said Augustine Tantillo, president of the National Council of Textile Organization. “The mentality is, ‘Can we increase our output first by becoming more efficient by using better technology as the first resort?’ ” Tantillo remembers when 1.8 million people worked in textile and apparel manufacturing about 20 years ago. Today, it’s around 600,000, including cotton and fiber industries, with some of the decrease caused by technology and some by cheaper labor overseas. Although U.S. manufacturing employment overall, as a share of all non-farm jobs, has been falling since the end of World War II, there was a particularly severe drop from 2000 to 2009. During that period, factory jobs plunged from more than 17 million to 11.5 million; about half of that came between 2000 and 2003 when the U.S. was in a relatively brief and mild recession. (It since has edged back up to about 12.3 million.) When Trump and Clinton point the finger at China, they aren’t totally off-base. Research suggests that a large chunk of the manufacturing job loss during the 2000s was the result of a surge in Chinese imports and competition, itself the consequence of changing U.S. policy in 2000 that gave permanent normal trade relations status to China and the country’s ascension to the World Trade Organization the following year. That designation removed the uncertainty of annual tariff renewals and spurred large-scale investments and activity from both U.S. and Chinese companies, accelerating what had been gradually shifting trends in global production and trade flows amid China’s rise, said Peter Schott of Yale University, who wrote a paper on the subject with Justin Pierce of the Federal Reserve. Part of that shift, though, included large-scale investments in technologies and processes — which boosted productivity but also restrained employment at home. In motor vehicle and parts manufacturing, domestic employment fell by half from 2000 to 2009, to about 650,000. Since the economic recovery in mid-2009, car sales have taken off and the industry’s gross output has more than doubled, to $662.5 billion last year. Another government measure of car-manufacturing value that excludes costs for energy and raw materials shows that the industry tripled between 2009 and 2015. But during that same period, the industry’s employment went up by only about 40 percent and remains far below what it was in 2000. The difference can be seen in the tens of thousands of robots and other streamlining processes, including advances in transportation and information technology, that have reduced the need for human hands at American auto plants. Since 2000, the traditional Big Three domestic automakers — General Motors, Ford and Chrysler — have sliced in half the labor hours needed to assemble a car, to about 22, according to Harbour Reports and the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. And the industry’s not done. Many of the labor hours of car production are in the final assembly stage, where seats, instrument panels and other parts are installed. Though still done largely manually, those tasks eventually will be performed by smaller and more dexterous robots, said Jay Baron, president of the Center for Automotive Research. “That’ll be the next big growth area,” he said.   Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Target, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, TJX Companies, Ross Stores, Gap, and Urban Outfitters are among US retailers releasing their latest quarterly earnings this week. Also scheduled to report are Cisco, Nestle and Deere. Last Friday shares of Nordstrom, the top US luxury department store chain, soared 8 percent. after it posted second-quarter profit that beat analysts’ expectations. Nordstrom was the latest department store to please investors following Macy’s and Kohl’s earlier in the week. Even so, a disappointing report on US retail sales on Friday reminded investors that consumers might be tightening their purse strings, and helped lower expectations the Fed will raise interest rates soon. “Investors aren’t viewing the Fed as an immediate threat, with the economy growing just slow enough to keep them from raising right now,” Terry Morris, Wyomissing, Pennsylvania-based managing director of equities at BB&T Institutional Investment Advisors, told Bloomberg. The Atlanta Fed downgraded its forecast for GDP growth in the third quarter of 2016 to 3.5 percent on Friday, from 3.7 percent on Tuesday. To be sure, some questioned the weak retail sales data. "You have had two months of very strong job growth. It just seems very odd that spending would be weak. I will wait for the revisions before declaring July retail spending means anything more than random volatility," Steve Blitz, chief economist at M Science in New York, told Reuters. For fresh clues on rates, investors will pour over minutes from the July 26-27 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, set for release this Wednesday. Meanwhile, there are also speeches from Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart on Tuesday and again on Wednesday, as well as from St Louis Fed's James Bullard on Thursday, and San Francisco Fed's John Williams on Friday. The latest economic data will arrive as reports on the Empire State manufacturing survey and the housing market index, due today; consumer price index, housing starts and industrial production, due Tuesday; Atlanta Fed business inflation expectations, due Wednesday; as well as weekly jobless claims, Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey, and leading indicators, due Thursday. Wall Street remains near record highs. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 percent, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.1 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.2 percent. It was Wall Street’s sixth weekly gain in seven, according to Bloomberg. “A lot of people who were scared out of equities earlier this year think they’re missing the train and want back in, and valuations haven’t necessarily deterred them,” BB&T Institutional Investment Advisors’ Morris told Bloomberg. Another reason for optimism is that corporate results have been better than expected overall. With most S&P 500 members through with reporting quarterly results, 78 percent beat profit forecasts while 56 percent surpassed on sales; even so, the S&P 500’s price relative to future earnings now stands at 18.6, the highest since 2002, according to Bloomberg. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index climbed 1.4 percent for the week. Investors will eye euro-zone data including the trade balance and ZEW economic sentiment, due Tuesday; and the current account and consumer price index, due Thursday.

Family had gathered to help prepare the house for flooding from the Tchefuncte River with sandbags and plastic tarps. The house flooded just a few months ago in the March floods with four feet of water. The tarps aren't intended to keep the water out, but to protect the house from the heavy river current. The house is already flooded with 6 inches of water inside.

The group first put out a call to its membership on Sunday, but will begin accepting donations from the general public on Monday. Specifically, the group is seeking diapers from sizes newborn to 5, as well as women's hygiene products and gift cards in $20 amounts to Target and Wal-Mart. The group also accept cash and check donations made to the Junior League for New Orleans for purchase of gift cards. All donations can be dropped off at the League's headquarters, 4319 Carondelet St. from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 pm., Monday through Friday. The group will deliver the items to Baton Rouge and Lafayette. Junior League of New Orleans president Maria Pardo Huete said the group immediately wanted the help. "The memory of Katrina is still strong with all of us," she said. "And we're women. So we think, what will women need right now? And they'll need diapers for their babies and formula, which they can buy with the gift cards."

Click here to enlarge images Sunday reader Sunday Reader: Stress over family finances propelled Clinton into corporate world How stress over family finances propelled Hillary Clinton into the corporate world By Amy Chozick • New York Times News Service Published Aug 14, 2016 at 12:06AM LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Losing the governor’s race here in 1980 so shattered a young Bill Clinton that he couldn’t face his supporters, so he sent his wife around to thank campaign workers instead. He later gathered with close friends for dinner but quietly sulked, playing the country song “I Don’t Know Whether to Kill Myself or Go Bowling” on the jukebox. But his wife had a more pressing concern: money. The ousted governor needed a job, the family needed a place to live, and moving out of the governor’s mansion meant losing the help they had as they raised their 9-month-old daughter, Chelsea. The morning after the election, Hillary Clinton worked the phones from the mansion, calling wealthy friends and asking for help. “The world changed. There was a tectonic shift,” said Thomas McLarty III, a friend of Bill Clinton’s who served as his White House chief of staff. Bill Clinton was of little use as he fixated on voters’ rejection. And for the first time, friends said, Hillary Clinton glimpsed fragility in the future she had moved to Arkansas to pursue. She worried about saving for Chelsea’s college, caring for her aging parents, and even possibly supporting herself should the marriage or their political dreams dissolve. “It was up to her to just keep holding things up,” said Nancy Pietrafesa, a college friend of Hillary Clinton’s who moved to Arkansas to work for Bill Clinton in the 1970s. Hillary Clinton’s relationship with money has long puzzled even some of her closest supporters: Despite choosing a life in government, she has appeared eager to make money, driven to provide for her family and helping amass a fortune of more than $50 million with her husband. But Hillary Clinton can seem blind to how her financial decisions are viewed and has suffered repeated political damage and accusations of conflicts of interest as a result — from serving on the corporate board of Wal-Mart while her husband was governor to initially accepting a $1.35 million mortgage personally secured by a top fundraiser for the family’s Chappaqua, New York, home. Her collection of more than $21 million in speaking fees from a range of groups, including Wall Street firms and other interests, led to one of the most potent attacks against her in this election cycle, given voters’ anger about economic inequality. Half of all voters said it bothered them “a lot” that Clinton gave numerous speeches to Wall Street banks, according to a Bloomberg Politics poll conducted in June. Donald Trump has called Clinton “totally owned by Wall Street.” Trump, whose own finances have drawn extensive scrutiny, may be an imperfect messenger, but “Republicans can say, ‘This undercuts everything she is saying about what she wants to do to regulate Wall Street and her economic populist stance,’” said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. Even some of Clinton’s allies privately say they are mystified by her choice to make the Wall Street speeches, given the likelihood that they would become an issue in a presidential campaign. And to some of them, her financial moves clash with the selfless Methodist credo to do good for others that she so often says guided her toward a life of public service. But her longtime friends say the contradiction is rooted in Clinton’s practicality and the boom-and-bust cycles that have characterized her life with Bill Clinton. At no time did those stresses fall more squarely on Hillary Clinton’s shoulders than in the difficult two-year period in Arkansas when she and her husband found themselves cast out of office, financially strained and deeply uncertain about the future. And the memory of that time shaped her desire to be free from financial burden. “Hillary had a couple years of the taste of what it means to be a working mother, without any help, to have to take care of a small baby and care for your job,” said James Blair, a close Clinton friend and lawyer who offered Hillary Clinton investment advice in the 1970s. The Clintons’ unexpected ouster from their comfortable life occurred at a time when Arkansas was swirling with new money and get-rich-quick schemes as companies like Tyson and Wal-Mart minted millionaires and new savings and loan institutions were spreading throughout the South. A generation of Ivy League-educated young people, like Bill Clinton, had returned to their home state to make their mark. Money seemed to be all around the Clintons, but they did not have much of their own. And unlike Hillary Clinton, a worrier by nature, Bill Clinton, consumed with his dreams of a political career, seemed indifferent to securing a financial future. “He was never interested in money, ever,” Blair said. “She is the one who had to be sure Chelsea was going to be able to afford college.” People close to Hillary Clinton don’t begrudge her desire to provide generously for her family, and certainly many presidential candidates and public servants acquire vast personal wealth. Asked in an interview whether earlier financial stresses had prompted her to pursue the lucrative speechmaking, Hillary Clinton said, “I really think it’s much simpler than that,” adding that it is typical for secretaries of state to share their views in speeches after leaving office. Thrift store decor It was one of the smallest houses on the block in Little Rock’s Hillcrest section, and Hillary Clinton largely bought it with her own money, the month after that devastating 1980 election loss. She filled the rooms with mismatched furniture bought at thrift stores and borrowed from her flamboyant mother-in-law. She converted the windowed attic into a bedroom for Chelsea, parked her Oldsmobile Cutlass in the weedy driveway, and chased after the family’s cocker spaniel, Zeke, who liked to chew through the fence. The Clintons had stretched their finances to afford the $112,000 home, which was down the hill from the city’s old-money mansions. The sprawling estate of Winthrop Rockefeller, the celebrated former governor, was so close it practically cast a shadow on the Clintons’ grassy backyard. Friends described the decor as unsightly, a jarring departure from the governor’s mansion. “That couch just jumped out at me,” said Bobby Roberts, a former aide to Bill Clinton, describing a scarlet-colored Victorian chaise that Bill Clinton’s mother, Virginia Kelly, had lent them. “It was in some bright, violent color.” And with no parents or in-laws in Little Rock, Hillary Clinton turned to friends and neighbors for help. She persuaded Carolyn Huber, who had helped run the governor’s mansion while Bill Clinton was in office, to continue to help care for Chelsea, who had grown fond of her. A neighbor, Manuel Lozano, recalled: Hillary “was running around, and my wife took care of Chelsea here and there whenever she needed help.” Bill Clinton had turned down out-of-state job offers in academia and Democratic politics, and instead took the only offer he had in Arkansas, to serve “of counsel” for $55,000 a year at the Wright, Lindsey & Jennings law firm, where Bill Clinton’s longtime adviser Bruce Lindsey was a partner. But he spent most of his time on the road, often accompanied by Lindsey, trying to win back the hearts of voters. “He had to go all over that state, touch base and apologize, and listen to why he lost,” Pietrafesa recalled, “and every one of those visits was a two-, three- or four-hour ordeal.” Hillary Clinton had become a partner at the Rose Law Firm in 1979, and during these lean years she balanced her work there with caring for Chelsea, who celebrated her first birthday and learned to walk in the Hillcrest house, on Midland Street. She often felt on her own as Bill Clinton crisscrossed the state, friends said. She increased her hours to bring in work for the firm, with business not as easy to come by now that she was no longer the governor’s wife. “The whole time period was a point of learning, after the defeat,” Jerry Jones, Hillary Clinton’s colleague at the firm, remembered. Friends said she would have focused on public service and charitable work and not gone to work at the firm — a practice known for representing the business and political elite — had she not been concerned about her family’s finances. Ann Henry, an Arkansas friend, described Hillary Clinton as an “oddity” there, where other women, mostly secretaries and paralegals, gawked at her curls and thrown-together clothes. (Hillary Clinton worked at the Rose Law Firm for roughly 15 years, the longest she has worked at any job, though it is not on her official campaign biography.) “I’m not sure she ever planned to be a corporate lawyer,” said Lissa Muscatine, a friend and former chief speechwriter to Hillary Clinton. But she did the work because “she had the earning capacity that he didn’t have as governor.” A frugal father Growing up in the upper-middle-class suburb of Park Ridge, Illinois, Hillary Rodham — whose mother had been raised in poverty and whose Depression-era father preached frugality — baby-sat and held summer jobs beginning when she was 13. Her father, Hugh Rodham, taught his only daughter fiscal responsibility and how to read stock tables in the newspaper. But he was not one to shower his children with material things. “Her mother came from nothing, and her father was self-made, so there’s always been an awareness of working hard to earn a living,” said Lisa Caputo, a friend and former White House aide. There was anxiety, too. The family was never comfortably affluent, and even as Hugh Rodham bought himself a Cadillac, he insisted his wife and children live modestly. Hillary and her brothers helped out at his drapery business, which eventually closed after sales slowed. By the time she was a student at Wellesley College, Hillary Clinton and many in her generation were expressing skepticism about the pursuit of money. In her 1969 commencement speech, she denounced materialism and corporate greed. “We’re searching for more immediate, ecstatic and penetrating modes of living,” she declared. When she moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas, and later married Bill Clinton in 1975, the Yale Law-educated couple lived happily earning about $18,000 a year each in their positions as professors. But several years later, as Bill Clinton planned his run for the governor’s office and the couple worried about starting a family, Hillary Clinton grew increasingly uneasy about their incomes and started to think more seriously about how to build a nest egg. “She had been the chief breadwinner and financial decision-maker,” her best friend, Diane Blair, wrote in notes she kept about the era. Arkansas was a small state with overlapping circles of the politically and economically powerful — and many of the Clintons’ contemporaries were getting rich. “The smart guys who were politically active would make that interesting investment that would push them from the ranks of the upper middle class into the wealthy and powerful,” said William Black, a former financial regulator and professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Hillary Clinton began seeking out investment opportunities, and in 1978 she made one of the most lucrative, if seemingly risky, financial decisions of her life. Blair, the Clintons’ close friend, had made several million dollars in the commodities market and urged Hillary Clinton to begin trading, too. With an initial investment of just $1,000, she made nearly $100,000 trading cattle futures in a 10-month period, which helped pay for the down payment on the Midland Street home. But the move later haunted her when the investment became the subject of scrutiny in the early years of the Clinton presidency. It still trails her occasionally: Trump raised it at a rally last month in North Carolina, as he attacked her for being “crooked.” “Look at her cattle futures!” he called out to the crowd. Also in 1978, another friend, James McDougal, persuaded Hillary Clinton to invest in another venture: the Whitewater real estate development on a brush-covered plot of land in the Ozarks. The Clintons ultimately lost money on the deal, but the development led to an investigation when Bill Clinton was in the White House. The deals were certainly tempting, given the couple’s income at the time. In 1978, Bill Clinton became one of the youngest, and lowest-paid, governors in the country, earning $33,519.14 his first year in office. Hillary Clinton’s income from the Rose Law Firm brought their combined wages in 1978 to $51,173. Even though she reaped big rewards on the commodities market, the experience was unnerving. Shortly after Chelsea was born, Hillary Clinton told her broker she wanted out. “I couldn’t take the stress,” she said at a campaign stop in June. She would, however, continue to shoulder her family’s financial worries. Not long after Bill Clinton won re-election in 1982, the Clintons sold the yellow house on Midland Street and moved back into the governor’s mansion, where they once again enjoyed free housing and the assistance of a small staff. Two years later, the state increased the governor’s term to four years, and the Clintons’ finances appeared more stable. Hillary Clinton went on to join the board of Wal-Mart, and she continued to work at the Rose Law Firm. By the time Bill Clinton was running for president, they reported $297,177 in total income on their 1992 tax returns, a sum that would put most Americans in the upper income tier, but seemed meager compared with the wealth of his opponents, George Bush and Ross Perot. “When we moved into the White House, we had the lowest net worth of any family since Harry Truman,” Bill Clinton has said. The White House years offered a respite from financial worry. As first lady, Hillary Clinton wrote a book, “It Takes a Village,” for which she did not accept an advance and donated the proceeds to charity. “HRC insists she will have time, wants it to have impact (of course, also wants it to make huge bucks),” Diane Blair wrote at the time. Still, the couple’s earlier financial decisions resurfaced in damaging ways. What started as an investigation into the Whitewater investment spun into revelations of Bill Clinton’s relationship with a White House intern, which led to the president’s impeachment by the House of Representatives. When the Clintons left the White House in 2000 — the first time they were without the safety net of public office in 18 years — they owed $5 million in legal fees and once again felt financial uncertainty. In 2014, Hillary Clinton described her family’s situation at the time in words that have bedeviled her candidacy: “Dead broke.” Once again, the Clintons needed a house, and once again they turned to the help of a wealthy friend. This time it was Terry McAuliffe, a longtime Clinton campaign fundraiser, who offered to guarantee the mortgage on the home they would move into after leaving the White House. But this time, the home — a $1.7 million, 11-room Dutch Colonial in the tony suburb of Chappaqua, New York — was not one of the smallest houses on the block. Hillary Clinton did not have to call the Roto-Rooter every time the old pipes clogged, or run to a neighbor’s house to borrow milk and eggs, as she had done in the house on Midland Street. And now it was Hillary Clinton, eyeing a Senate seat from New York, who left her husband at home as she hit the road, crisscrossing the state for her campaign. 14727442 View next article in Opinion     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

BRCC North will operate every hour Monday through Thursday from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. and on Fridays from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. The BRCC South will operate every hour Monday through Thursday from 7:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. and on Fridays from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.   The Waynesboro Circulator route has added a stop at the Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market, and several under-utilized stops have been removed from the route. Popular stops will continue to be served including Waynesboro Town Center, Wal-Mart, the community center, social services, the library and other destinations. The Waynesboro Circulator will continue to operate Monday through Friday from 6:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and will allow connections to the Route 250 Connector and the Stuarts Draft Link at the Waynesboro HUB located at Wal-Mart. The 340 Connector route has been replaced with a revised route called the Stuarts Draft Link. Additional stops have been added at retail and medical destinations within Stuarts Draft and providing service, without transfer, to Augusta Health. This new route will operate Monday through Friday from 6:50 a.m. to 4:43 p.m., with a two-hour midday break from 10:43 a.m. to 12:50 p.m. and will provide connections to the Waynesboro Circulator and the 250 Connector at the Waynesboro HUB located at Wal-Mart. THE NEWS LEADER Stranded: Depending on public transit in the Valley BRITE Bus offers fixed-route and on-demand transportation in the Staunton-Augusta-Waynesboro area. Services are administered by the Central Shenandoah Planning District Commission with operational recommendations provided by the BRITE Transit Advisory Committee.

The cost was almost $120. At a local Wal-Mart, it took 45 minutes and $56 to buy supplies for a kindergartner.   Susan Sarkauskas Follow @dh_ssarkauskas     Shopping for school supplies is a rite of passage for parents. Mothers kneel on the floors of stores, pawing through bins for the correct-colored notebooks. Fathers urge daughters to quickly choose between "Frozen" or "Dora the Explorer" backpacks. Strangers commiserate as they hunt. I, a childless outsider, entered the fray, shopping online for items required of the average fourth-grader at Willow Bend Elementary School in Palatine and a typical kindergartner at Western Avenue Elementary School in Geneva. Would it take all day? Would I be able to find everything in one stop? Online For the fourth-grader, it took me 52 minutes to load my shopping cart at officedepot.com. A 120-sheet pack of wide-ruled loose-leaf paper? The choices are 110 sheets or 150 sheets. (I went with the 150). There weren't any yellow notebooks or Ziploc bags in anything close to the desired counts. Or the right brand of pencil box. The $4.49 8-pack of paper folders didn't have all the colors I needed, and the plastic ones cost $1.49 each. The online store was out of single low-odor black dry-erase markers. With tax, the bill came to $119.81, for 111 of the 115 items requested (including 60 pencils). In store Finding the two 24-count packs of Crayola crayons was easy at Wal-Mart. They were right by the entrance. At 50 cents a pack, they were a bargain. But "Crayola Thick & Thin Markers"? I searched the three-aisle display of school supplies for such a combination pack. Then I headed back to "office supplies." Then back to the school display. Then it dawned on me the school probably meant one pack of regular markers and one pack of thin-tipped markers. I despaired of ever finding the prongless poly folders. Pronged, pronged, pronged, pronged, pronged read the boxes. Finally found them in the office supplies area. Watercolors: Size not specified. Eight- or 16-color palette? Feeling generous, I went with 16. Four large Elmer's glue sticks. Two problems: 1. No packages marked "Large." 2. "JUMBO" came only in three-packs. Ziploc heavy-duty gallon-size bags: No count. Does "heavy-duty" mean "freezer?" Two containers of Clorox or Lysol wipes. Again: What count? Dry-erase markers: Broad-tipped wanted. I'm hoping they really meant chisel-tipped. Facial tissue: Has to be a rectangular box. Huh? It took 45 minutes and $56 to outfit the imaginary kindergartner.

Your Right to Know Public records complaint program open for business By Darrel Rowland The Columbus Dispatch  •  Sunday August 14, 2016 10:10 AM View Slideshow Request to buy this photo AP Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton (L), and Donald Trump (R) The 10 women on the other side of the one-way mirror looked at Robert Blizzard like he’d just set off a stink bomb. In a way, he had. Blizzard asked those Columbus-area “Wal-Mart moms” for a brief description of how they feel about the 2016 presidential campaign. The words poured out quickly: Worried. Frustrated. Messy. Divided. Ridiculous. Disrespectful. Circus show. And the candidates? “I’m not sure either one is 100 percent qualified,” Donna said. Gidget chimed in, “I feel like no matter which way we choose, we lose.” An exasperated Ivania remarked: “I’d pick Minnie Mouse right now.” The 10 swing voters made up a focus group last week assembled by bipartisan national pollsters to gauge sentiments from “real people” about this year’s election. Columbus, often selected as a test market for products and politicians, was chosen for one gathering. Another was held in Phoenix by the organizers, GOP polling firm Public Opinion Strategies and Democratic pollsters Penn Schoen Berland. “What you saw there in that group is a firsthand observation of what we’re seeing in the (polling) numbers in the state and nation,” said Neil Newhouse, longtime head of the Republican firm that has conducted surveys for numerous Ohio GOP candidates. Newhouse said it’s the most hostile electorate he’s seen since at least 1992, which featured the rise of plain-spoken independent Ross Perot. “These voters are more turned off. They are worried, frustrated, anxious because many of them don’t like either one of their choices.” Newhouse’s company identified “Wal-Mart moms” — mothers without a firm presidential choice who have children younger than 18 and have shopped at the ubiquitous retailer in the past month — as a key voting demographic in 2008. The group, which makes up 14 to 17 percent of the electorate, has been tapped every two years since and proven keen indicators of national voting trends. The Dispatch was allowed to personally observe the Columbus focus group, assembled in an Easton office building, but it could only use first names of participants. The rancorous 2016 campaign even has spread into these women’s families, friends and social networks, leading to harsh exchanges with relatives and significant “de-friending” on social media. Mary said she attended her 40th high school class reunion last weekend, and “I can’t believe how many people were going around talking about politics.” Ruth said, “It’s disgusting how everybody has to choose a side. It’s just crazy.” Dana, one of two African-Americans on the panel, said, “On social media, honestly, I’ve seen a lot of racism.” The women not only shared their repulsion with their presidential choices this year but also provided insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each candidate. For example, Trump was complimented for being confident, outspoken and patriotic. “He says what lot of us are thinking, sometimes,” Gidget said. Maria said, “It would be interesting to have a successful businessman to fix our trade deficit." And the negatives? “I think his weakness is his mouth,” Donna said. “To me, he has no filter.” Anita wondered whether he is racist. And Ruth put it even more succinctly: “He’s just a jerk.” Clinton’s strengths revolved around her government experience and her temperament in contrast to Trump’s. But the women really unloaded on the candidate attempting to become the first female president. “She has a really hard shell around her,” Julie said, calling her “emotionless.” Gidget said, “Historically, everything the Clintons have done have been pushed under the rug." Donna said, “Things come out of her mouth and you don’t know what’s the truth and what’s a lie." To that, Dana added, “I don’t know if she can do anything other than lie.” When asked which one they'd rather have over for a cookout, it was Trump, seven to three. After listening to the 90-minute session, Newhouse said he thinks the common characterization this year of "the angry voter" is misdirected. "I think there is frustration with the direction of the country, but this is not anger," he said. "There’s almost bewilderment that these are the two candidates that are the best the parties have to offer." drowland@dispatch.com @darreldrowland Favorite Print Story Advertisement • Place an ad News Video More Videos Advertisement • Place an ad Explore Columbus Search Businesses Featured Businesses Loading...

Chosen were his award- winning collection of short stories, Encounters With Life — Tales of Living, Loving & Laughter, and his popular mystery novel, The Maidstone Conspiracy. The announcement was made recently by Osborne’s publisher, Solstice Publishing Inc., of Farmington, Missouri. “We don’t know how Walmart makes its choices, or when the books might be listed on their Canadian site, but I’m delighted with the added exposure,” Osborne said, adding that both are available locally at Bookland downtown and Coles in the Village Green Centre. In January, Encounters With Life was named Best Short Story Collection of 2015 in an international poll of readers. In that same poll, readers gave The Maidstone Conspiracy second place as the Best Mystery of 2015. “I must say, it was very flattering to have my books chosen by readers from around the world,” Osborne said. “And now to have two selected for sale by Walmart’s huge online store is amazing.” Osborne is also the author of the bestselling novel The Ultimate Threat, a gripping story about the spread of the religious extremists ISIS. It was the top bestselling thriller novel on Amazon for several weeks following its release in June 2015 by his previous publisher, Endeavour Press Ltd. of London, U.K.   We encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

White's regional safety manager for Wal-Mart, Jennifer Gray, was on hand and said the honor was well-deserved. "I'm going to buy him a truck. He gets a new semi, whatever color he wants," Gray said. "He's been a great driver forever, but he's just a nice person, too. I think that people just don't know that he has a kind heart. He's very business, he's very professional. He's just an awesome individual."

Bright smile: 2-year-old Haleigh Lanphere developed a bond with JSU's football team By Joe Medley, Star Sports Columnist, jmedley@annistonstar.com Joe Medley Aug 13, 2016 (…) Photo by Stephen Gross / The Anniston Star/File In this file photo, Haleigh Lanphere meets Cocky before Gamecock Walk during the second round JSU vs Chattanooga NCAA playoff game at Jacksonville State. JACKSONVILLE — Haleigh Lanphere fell in love with her red No. 1 Jacksonville State jersey from the moment it caught her eye in Wal-Mart. The toddler who doctors said would never walk or talk because of a rare genetic condition walked into the store, saw the jersey and did her best imitation of seagulls from the movie “Finding Nemo.” “She walked in and said, ‘Mine,’” said Cathy Lanphere, Haleigh’s mother. “We put it in the buggy.” That smiling little girl in the buggy had lots of JSU apparel, from onesies to that jersey. She wore them when she went with her parents to JSU sporting events in her short life. Football, basketball or baseball, she found her way into the hearts of JSU athletes ... and lots of pictures with them. She died July 10 at age 2, after the last of a string of seizures that started June 27, and several JSU football players wear pink or blue #HaleighStrong bracelets in her memory. Her jersey might make one more appearance in JSU Stadium … hoisted by JSU players as they take the field for their Sept. 1 season opener against North Alabama. At least, that’s how her dad envisions the moment, and it just might happen. “We’ll probably hold up something for her first game and do something like that for her,” JSU coach John Grass said. “We’ll definitely miss her.” A Gamecock family Cathy Lanphere acknowledged she wasn’t much of a sports fan, and Chris put JSU on her radar. A Saks High graduate, he grew up following JSU and attended the school between 2002-04. +2  Haleigh Lanphere rides her dad Chris Lanphere's shoulders before Gamecock Walk during the second round JSU vs Chattanooga NCAA playoff game at Jacksonville State. Photo by Stephen Gross / The Anniston Star The two married March 9, 2013, and Chris enticed Cathy to her first JSU football game the following football season, against Jacksonville University. “That was Cathy’s first game because she loves dolphins,” Chris said. “I kind of bribed her with, the team JSU is playing’s mascot is a dolphin.” JSU’s 48-13 victory was the first of many campus visits for Cathy, who came with Chris from their home in Pell City. “He’s always wanting me to watch them play, practice and everything,” Cathy said. Haleigh was born at 2 a.m. Nov. 16 that same year, the day JSU lost 52-14 at Eastern Illinois. The Gamecocks lost a game that day but gained a fan. The family attended JSU sporting events year-round. Football, men’s and women’s basketball, baseball … they were more than there. She got her first basketball at a JSU game and seemed to love going to games at Pete Mathews Coliseum. “She would have a field day. We got messages from a couple of the girls’ players about how they used to love seeing her in the stands every time they played. Some of the guys loved watching her grow.” Haleigh wanted to get close to Rudy Abbott Field and get high-fives from players before baseball games. “Any time I’d walk past her, I’d always reach out and give her a high-five,” said JSU senior Gavin Golsan, who just finished his baseball eligibility and came out for football. “She’d be grinning ear to ear and slap my hand.” Haleigh felt just as at home in JSU Stadium for football games. She would take in tailgating, meet Cocky, JSU’s mascot, and watch “Cock Walk,” as JSU players walked to the stadium. Her first JSU exposure was a football game, and she brought her game face. “She was watching the (Marching) Southerners pregame, and I remember trying to play with her,” Chris said. “She would just give me the meanest look, and then she would look back over.” +2  Offensive lineman Blake Burks with 2-year-old Haleigh Lanphere, who died July 10. Courtesy photo Haleigh also collected high-fives. Her father had her stationed along the fence, near where players entered the field for pregame warmups and exited after games. She’d call players whose names she didn’t know “Hey.” She made friends closer to her own age, including Kaydon Jenkins. “Any time my son was around and she was around, they’d play together a lot,” said JSU quarterback Eli Jenkins, who wears a pink #HaleighStrong bracelet on his left wrist. Jenkins took cell-phone pictures of the two playing, and other players posed for pictures with Haleigh. One shows two big linemen, 2015 seniors Blake Burks and Kyron Samuels, posing with her after JSU’s victory over Southeast Missouri State. “You could tell she was a great kid, and her parents loved her to death,” Jenkins said. Wide receiver Josh Barge described Haleigh as “strong.” “You knew something was wrong with her, but she never showed it,” he said. “It was kind of life-changing.” #HaleighStrong Haleigh’s challenges started with 16p13.11 microdeletion, which rarechromo.org describes as “a very rare genetic condition in which a tiny piece is missing from one of the 46 chromosomes — chromosome 16.” Doctors discovered the condition after Haleigh’s newborn screen came back abnormal. “She was the 34th one ever found like that,” Cathy said. Effects can vary, even between family members. Not everyone shows effects. Common features include delay in learning to sit, move and walk; delays in starting to speak and language development; and increased risk of developing seizures. “They told us she’d never walk,” Chris said. “They told us she’d never talk. They told us she would have a learning disability.” Haleigh also had aortic stenosis, a narrowing of the valve in the large blood vessel branching off the heart. “Other than that, they (doctors) really weren’t concerned with anything until she started having her seizures,” Cathy said. Those started June 27, Cathy said, and Haleigh’s parents noticed changes. Their daughter had shortness of breath more easily and didn’t want to play. “She’d just lay around, and she didn’t want to do anything,” Cathy said. “She wasn’t acting like herself. She wasn’t her go-go-go personality. She’d just want to sit there and lay there. She just wanted to be held.” Doctors also found enlargement of the right side of Haleigh’s heart, Cathy said. They were trying to find the cause and had scheduled a heart catheterization for July 15. Haleigh had a seizure July 10, prompting paramedics take her to Children’s Hospital in Birmingham. Cathy rode in the front of the ambulance, and Chris trailed it. “Somewhere, right before the exit for St. Vincent’s East, I don’t know what happened to her,” Cathy said. “He just yelled from the back, ‘Get to the nearest hospital.’ They wouldn’t let me back there. “We don’t know what happened from the time we left the driveway until the time she got to the hospital. They don’t know. They just know that her heart stopped, and she fought for two-and-a-half hours.” Reactions, tributes Haleigh’s death was felt from Pell City to the JSU Gamecock Fieldhouse. “We’ve gotten so many messages from people that go to JSU or people that were on the football team or basketball team,” Chris said, a tear streaming down the right side of his face. “‘Your little girl was such an inspiration. Her smile was just so contagious, her little sassy attitude.’ “They said, most of all, even though she had all of these different problems, she was always smiling. A lot of people would tell us, that’s what gets us through the day now. Whenever we’re having a bad day, we would think about here and all of her smiles, and all the bad days just go away.” The Lanpheres had #HaleighStrong bracelets made in blue and pink, and several JSU players have them. Some have more than one. Grass said he admires how Haleigh “battled.” “She battled hard, and it was good to see a smile on a little girl’s face at that age,” he said. “I think that’s what the game brings. It brings a smile on all kids’ faces, but especially a kid in her situation. “She’s definitely a part of us.” Golsan, who shared high-fives with Haleigh at the backstop, had looked forward to doing the same at the gate to Burgess-Snow Field. “Everybody is still mourning her loss, but we know she’s watching over us,” he said. “Chris and Cathy are great people. I’m sure they’re still going to be here supporting, and Haleigh is going to be watching us.” Sports Columnist Joe Medley: 256-235-3576. On Twitter: @jmedley_star.

The baby’s father, who works at the store in the suburb of Helotes, told officers that he forgot to drop his son off at day care before going to work about 6:15 a.m. Friday, said police Capt. Anthony Burges. The father found his child dead after finishing work and returning to the SUV about 3 p.m. The father was taken to a hospital after reporting chest pains, Burges said. No charges have been filed, and the identities of the father and boy have not been released. Temperatures in the area hovered around 100 degrees much of the afternoon. The death brings the number of children who have died in hot cars in the U.S. this year to at least 27, including six in Texas, said Janette Fennell, founder and president of KidsAndCars.org, a national child safety nonprofit in Philadelphia. On Aug. 4, twin 15-month-old girls died after being found in the back seat of a hot SUV parked in front of a duplex in Carrollton in northwestern Georgia. When police arrived, they found people holding the girls in the water of a baby pool behind the duplex, some with ice packs, trying to cool the girls off. Last year, there were 15 heatstroke deaths of children in vehicles, Fennell said. The toll began rising in the 1990s with the passing of laws requiring that young children be placed in the back seat to avoid air-bag injuries. With the children strapped into the backseat, drivers can forget them, Fennell said. Fennell said the numbers of heatstroke deaths of kids in cars has fluctuated, averaging 37 such deaths a year since 1998. The worst year was 2010, with 49, according to both a count by Fennell and Jan Null, a research meteorologist at San Jose State University, who also tracks numbers. Parents should get into the habit of always opening their back doors when they leave the vehicle, according to Fennell. Leaving a purse or cell phone in the back seat can help. Parents also need to make sure their day care calls them if the child doesn’t show up, she said. Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

(Reuters) Related Stories Children's Aid Society says people who leave kids in hot cars not always 'problem parents' Father of twin girls found dead in hot car 'had been consuming alcoholic beverages' 3 kids left in hot car may mean charges for mother A six-month-old boy died after being left all day in a hot sport utility vehicle in a San Antonio-area Walmart parking lot, authorities said. His death brings the number of children who have died in hot cars in the U.S. this year to at least 27, including six in Texas, said Janette Fennell, founder and president of KidsAndCars.org, a national child safety non-profit based in Philadelphia. That's up from last year's total of 15. Father arrested in deaths of twin girls found in hot car had been drinking: police Children's Aid Society says 'good parents in a hurry' tend to leave kids in hot cars The baby's father, who works at the store in the suburb of Helotes, told officers that he forgot to drop his son off at day care before going to work about 6:15 a.m. Friday, said Helotes police Capt. Anthony Burges. The father found his child dead after finishing work and returning to the SUV about 3 p.m. Temperatures in the area hovered around 38 C much of the afternoon. The father was taken to a hospital after reporting chest pains, Burges said. No charges have been filed in the case. The name of the infant's father has not been released by authorities. The Bexar County Medical Examiner's Office on Saturday identified the infant as six-month-old Dillon Martinez from San Antonio. Helotes police had initially said the infant was seven months old. Number of child hot car deaths continue to rise According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and data collected by San Jose State University, the number of children dying of heat stroke in automobiles began to rise following the widespread introduction of passenger-side airbags in the 1990s. An increase in airbag related fatalities of children in front seats prompted parents to buckle their children in rear seats, but while airbag-related fatalities began to decrease by 2000, the number of children dying of heat stroke rose due to children in back seats being less noticeable to parents and caregivers, according to researchers at San Jose State University. Baby found locked in hot car in Markham, Ont., parking lot With the children strapped into the back seat, drivers can tend to forget them, Fennell said. Fennell said the numbers of heatstroke deaths of kids in cars fluctuated in the following decades, averaging 37 such deaths a year since 1998. The worst year was 2010, with 49, according to both a count by Fennell and Jan Null, a research meteorologist at San Jose State University, who also tracks numbers. Parents should get into the habit of always opening their back doors when they leave the vehicle, says founder of U.S. child safety non-profit. (Fred Beckham/Associated Press) This year, on Aug. 4, twin 15-month-old girls died after being found in the back seat of a hot SUV parked in front of a duplex near Carrollton in northwestern Georgia. When police arrived, they found people holding the girls in the water of a baby pool behind the duplex, some with ice packs, trying to cool the girls off. The temperature inside a parked car on a 32-degree day will reach 48 C in 20 minutes and 56 degrees after an hour, Null said. Parents should get into the habit of always opening their back doors when they leave the vehicle, according to Fennell. Leaving a purse or cellphone in the back seat can help. Parents also need to make sure their day care calls them if the child doesn't show up, she said. © The Associated Press, 2016 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Latest Video Allied gets 3 out of 5 stars 4:11 Ellen DeGeneres pulls off mannequin challenge at White House 0:33 Moana gets 4 out of 5 stars 5:20 Ellen DeGeneres gets teary as Obama presents medal 0:56 Most Viewed Japan hit by earthquake considered an aftershock of 2011 Fukushima disaster Trump says he will pull U.S. out of TPP on 1st day in office read comments How Trump's son-in-law could skirt nepotism laws and find his way into the White House read comments 'Hail Trump' shout draws Nazi salutes at alt-right group meeting read comments Trump's strategy of bypassing the media raises 'danger signs' read comments Trump eyes Romney, Mattis for top cabinet jobs Trump lukewarm about prosecuting Clinton, condemns alt-right group in Times interview read comments Rare thunderstorm asthma kills 4 in Australia School bus driver charged after children killed in crash Mike Pence fights public release of Indiana emails Right Communications The National Canada's destination for original journalism and stories with added depth and context.

(KTRK) KTRK Saturday, August 13, 2016 SAN ANTONIO, TX (KTRK) -- A 7-month-old baby died in a hot car Friday in a San Antonio Walmart parking lot. The child's hot car death is the sixth one in Texas this year. It's also the 26th hot car death this year nationwide. RELATED: Mom of twins who died in hot car apologizes Police said the baby's father, who is a Walmart employee, told police he forgot to take the baby to day care before he got to work around 6:15 a.m. When the father went out to his car, he made the tragic discovery. RELATED: Child left in hot car while parents were in church dies Police say they arrived to find the father leaned over the baby. They said it was obvious nothing could be done and that the baby had died. TranStar launched a PSA this week encouraging drivers to create habits so they don't leave their children behind. In the PSA, you see a man take off his shoes before getting into the car. Once he arrives at his destination he puts the shoes back on. The idea is, once he arrives he had to put his shoes on to get out of the car, thus, triggering a reminder that there is also a child in the backseat. "How many times have we all been driving somewhere and habits kick in and we go our normal path and then suddenly we find ourselves going, oh I'm not supposed to be here. I'm supposed to be there, that's how the tragedy occurs. People get distracted," said Harris County Judge Ed Emmett. RELATED: Police break window to rescue child from hot car The father was taken to a hospital for observation after complaining of chest pain. No charges have been filed at this time.

His death brings the number of children who have died in hot cars in the US this year to at least 27, including six in Texas, said Janette Fennell, founder and president of KidsAndCars.org, a national child safety non-profit based in Philadelphia. That's up from last year's total of 15. The baby's father, who works at the store in the suburb of Helotes, told officers that he forgot to drop his son off at day care before going to work about 06:15 on Friday, said Helotes police Captain Anthony Burges. The father found his child dead after finishing work and returning to the SUV about 15:00. Temperatures in the area hovered around 38°C much of the afternoon. The father was taken to a hospital after reporting chest pains, Burges said. No charges have been filed, and the identities of the father and boy have not been released. Heatstroke deaths According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and data collected by San Jose State University, the number of children dying of heat stroke in automobiles began to rise following the widespread introduction of passenger-side air bags in the 1990s. An increase in air bag related fatalities of children in front seats prompted parents to buckle their children in rear seats, but while air bag-related fatalities began to decrease by 2000, the number of children dying of heat stroke rose due to children in back seats being less noticeable to parents and caregivers, according to researchers at San Jose State University. With the children strapped into the back seat, drivers can tend to forget them, Fennell said. Fennell said the numbers of heatstroke deaths of kids in cars fluctuated in the following decades, averaging 37 such deaths a year since 1998. The worst year was 2010, with 49, according to both a count by Fennell and Jan Null, a research meteorologist at San Jose State University, who also tracks numbers. This year, on August 4, twin 15-month-old girls died after being found in the back seat of a hot SUV parked in front of a duplex car Carrollton in north-western Georgia. When police arrived, they found people holding the girls in the water of a baby pool behind the duplex, some with ice packs, trying to cool the girls off. The temperature inside a parked car on a hot day will reach 48°C in 20 minutes and 56°C after an hour, Null said. Parents should get into the habit of always opening their back doors when they leave the vehicle, according to Fennell. Leaving a purse or cellphone in the back seat can help. Parents also need to make sure their day care calls them if the child doesn't show up, she said. Read more on:    us Join the conversation! 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.

This actually wasn’t my goal when I bought a $12 bookshelf from Wal-Mart. I only bought it because a) it was super cheap; b) it wasn’t that heavy, so I could pick it up myself; and c) I really just needed a bookshelf to support the giant stacks of books currently just sitting on the floor in my room. Racey Burden I’m addicted to buying books. It’s a problem. Anyway, so I brought the faux-oak finish, black bookshelf home and discovered that I didn’t feel motivated to put it together myself. I did the only thing to do in such a situation and recruited my brother, Ridge, to help. It immediately became clear that neither of us knew what we were doing. Also, this bookshelf was hideous, and clearly not made of real wood. I hated it but decided to proceed anyway because my books looked so sad on the floor. Neither Ridge nor I have an abundance of patience, apparent by the fact we soon gave up on the instructions (confusing, and solely in picture form) and began doing whatever we wanted. We didn’t like the plastic screws provided with the shelf. Ridge put real, metal screws in. It broke chunks of the “wood” off. We were getting impatient trying to fit the pieces together as described. I poured Gorilla Glue on and started sticking the shelves together that way. Didn’t feel like waiting on the Gorilla Glue to dry? We let it go and watched the whole shelf crumble apart. In the end, we only ever had two pieces of a seven-piece shelf together at once. I don’t think we touched half the little nails and screws that came with the piece of junk. I grew bored of the project before Ridge did, but I could tell he was only trying to fix the shelf because I’d asked him for his help. The Burden men have this thing about always fixing stuff for people. They’re stubborn like that. Eventually, I told him to give it up. The shelf was clearly a lost cause, chipped and covered in dried glue, plastic screws broken everywhere, now lost to the carpet. It wasn’t meant to be handled as viciously as we had. Fake wood is apparently not made to hold up under a real hammer. Who knew? Not us. We surveyed the wreckage in silence. Finally, I said, “Well, it was only $12, so …” “Do you want to burn it?” Ridge asked. Oh, absolutely I wanted to burn it. Another Burden hereditary trait – we all have a bit of pyromania. So we lugged the bookshelf outside to our utility vehicle and loaded it in the back. Then we drove out to Ridge’s bonfire pit in the back field (like I said, we like to burn stuff). But guilt soon overcame me, and I put a stop to the party. “We’d have to call the sheriff’s office to report it,” I told him. “You’re not supposed to burn without letting them know.” (I only know that thanks to this job and all the unreported fire calls I hear on scanner, and I did not want the Decatur Fire Department to come to our house.) “Are you serious?” he griped, but stopped before pouring the gasoline on the discarded shelves. In the end, we left it. It’s still out there, probably rotting away however faux-wood rots, waiting for us to actually burn it. I think Ridge has forgiven me for putting a stop to his fun, though I haven’t asked. It’s obviously a sign that Ridge loves me that he was willing to spend an hour-and-a-half attempting to put together a crappy bookshelf, only to not even be permitted to light it on fire at the end. Sorry, bud. Soon. Soon. Racey Burden is a Messenger reporter and the oldest of the three Burden siblings. Leave a Reply.

The Bexar County Medical Examiner’s Office identified the child as 6-month-old Dillon Martinez, son of Trinidad Martinez, who is an employee of the Helotes store. The father was supposed to drop the child off at day care before he began work at 6:15 a.m. on Friday. RELATED: Baby found dead in vehicle at Helotes parking lot When the father returned to the car in the afternoon, when temperatures reached the low 100s, he found the infant dead. Helotes police continued interviewing store employees on Saturday. “This is a very active investigation,” said Helotes police Capt. Anthony Burgess. “There are no charges filed, but that is not saying there will not be any. “We have to look at every angle — we don’t want to jump to any conclusions,” Burgess said. The Medical Examiner has yet to rule on a cause of death. Most Popular 1 Donald Trump called son of slain SAPD Det.

(Photo by Chris Hondros/Getty Images) Chris Hondros Copyright Getty Images Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next HELOTES, Texas (AP) — A 7-month-old boy died after being left all day in a hot sport utility vehicle in a San Antonio-area Wal-Mart parking lot, authorities said. His death brings the number of children who have died in hot cars in the U.S. this year to at least 27, including six in Texas, said Janette Fennell, founder and president of KidsAndCars.org, a national child safety nonprofit based in Philadelphia. That's up from last year's total of 15. The baby's father, who works at the store in the suburb of Helotes, told officers that he forgot to drop his son off at day care before going to work about 6:15 a.m. Friday, said Helotes police Capt. Anthony Burges. The father found his child dead after finishing work and returning to the SUV about 3 p.m. Temperatures in the area hovered around 100 degrees much of the afternoon. The father was taken to a hospital after reporting chest pains, Burges said. No charges have been filed, and the identities of the father and boy have not been released. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and data collected by San Jose State University, the number of children dying of heat stroke in automobiles began to rise following the widespread introduction of passenger-side air bags in the 1990s. An increase in air-bag related fatalities of children in front seats prompted parents to buckle their children in rear seats, but while air bag-related fatalities began to decrease by 2000, the number of children dying of heat stroke rose due to children in back seats being less noticeable to parents and caregivers, according to researchers at San Jose State University. With the children strapped into the back seat, drivers can tend to forget them, Fennell said. Fennell said the numbers of heatstroke deaths of kids in cars fluctuated in the following decades, averaging 37 such deaths a year since 1998. The worst year was 2010, with 49, according to both a count by Fennell and Jan Null, a research meteorologist at San Jose State University, who also tracks numbers. This year, on Aug. 4, twin 15-month-old girls died after being found in the back seat of a hot SUV parked in front of a duplex car Carrollton in northwestern Georgia. When police arrived, they found people holding the girls in the water of a baby pool behind the duplex, some with ice packs, trying to cool the girls off. The temperature inside a parked car on a 90-degree day will reach 119 degrees in 20 minutes and 133 degrees after an hour, Null said. Parents should get into the habit of always opening their back doors when they leave the vehicle, according to Fennell. Leaving a purse or cellphone in the back seat can help. Parents also need to make sure their day care calls them if the child doesn't show up, she said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Bexar County Medical Examiner’s Office identified the child as 6-month-old Dillon Martinez, son of Trinidad Martinez, who is an employee of the Helotes store. The father was supposed to drop the child off at day care before he began work at 6:15 a.m. on Friday. RELATED: Baby found dead in vehicle at Helotes parking lot When the father returned to the car in the afternoon, when temperatures reached the low 100s, he found the infant dead. Helotes police continued interviewing store employees on Saturday. “This is a very active investigation,” said Helotes police Capt. Anthony Burgess. “There are no charges filed, but that is not saying there will not be any. “We have to look at every angle — we don’t want to jump to any conclusions,” Burgess said.

The baby's father, who works at the store in the suburb of Helotes, told officers that he forgot to drop his son off at day care before going to work about 6.15am Friday, said Helotes police Captain Anthony Burges.  The father found his child dead after finishing work and returning to the SUV about 3pm. Firefighters reported the father was visibly distraught while leaning over the child, who had been declared deceased. A seven-month-old boy died after being left all day in a hot SUV in the parking lot of a Helotes, Texas, Walmart (pictured), where his father worked The father was taken to a hospital after reporting chest pains, Burges said. Officials said the father was cooperating with police until he 'locked up', which they said was likely due to shock, according to the Houston Chronicle.   No charges have been filed, and the identities of the father and boy have not been released. Temperatures in the area hovered around 100 degrees much of the afternoon. The death brings the number of children who have died in hot cars in the U.S. this year to at least 27, six in Texas, said Janette Fennell, founder and president of KidsAndCars.org, a national child safety nonprofit based in Philadelphia.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Reality show mom, 62, appears in court after her... White mother whose daughter, 2, died in hot car will NOT... Share this article Share On August 4, twin 15-month-old girls died after being found in the back seat of a hot SUV parked in front of a duplex car Carrollton in northwestern Georgia.  When police arrived, they found people holding the girls in the water of a baby pool behind the duplex, some with ice packs, trying to cool the girls off. Last year, there were 15 heatstroke deaths of children in vehicles, Fennell said. The toll began rising sharply in the 1990s with the passing of laws requiring that young children be placed in the back seat to avoid air-bag injuries.  The death of the boy in Helotes brings the number of children who have died in hot cars in the U.S. this year to at least 27 (stock image of children who have died in hot cars) With the children strapped into the back seat, drivers can tend to forget them, Fennell said. Fennell said the numbers of heatstroke deaths of kids in cars fluctuated in the following decades, averaging 37 such deaths a year since 1998.  The worst year was 2010, with 49, according to both a count by Fennell and Jan Null, a research meteorologist at San Jose State University, who also tracks numbers. The temperature inside a parked car on a 90-degree day will reach 119 degrees in 20 minutes and 133 degrees after an hour, Null said. Parents should get into the habit of always opening their back doors when they leave the vehicle, according to Fennell.  Leaving a purse or cellphone in the back seat can help.  Parents also need to make sure their day care calls them if the child doesn't show up, she said.

Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Aug 13, 2016 at 11:27AM Target will once again sell Amazon.com gadgets on its website and at its stores. Image source: Courtney Boyd Myers via Flickr. In the staring contest between Target (NYSE:TGT) and Amazon.com, (NASDAQ:AMZN), it was Target that blinked first. Four years after dropping the internet retailer's gadgets from its stores, the brick-and-mortar retailer is restocking Amazon products. Shoppers can now buy Amazon Kindles, Fire sticks, and tablets on Target's website, and by October will be able to pick them up in stores. The enemy of your enemy is not your friend The move to drop Amazon made sense at the time. While Target wanted to give its customers access to a broad array of popular items, it belatedly realized the e-commerce leader was really a wolf in sheep's clothing. The products weren't providing the same kind of margin an iPad did, and gave consumers easier access to Amazon's own website where they could make purchases. Target decided that helping the enemy was not in its best interests. While Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) also woke to that realization and quickly followed Target's lead, the move to drop Amazon was part of a broader play by Target to separate itself from the one competitor that hurt it most. Not only was the retailer not going to carry Amazon's products, it also took away its e-commerce technology platform, order fulfillment network, and guest services operations from Amazon's web services, choosing instead to build out its own platform ahead of the 2011 Christmas holidays. Not that anyone thought the decision to dump Amazon was going to hurt the internet retailer, even if it made sense to not actively support the competition. But it's a tactic the internet retailer has used before to get its nose under a rival's tent and exploit the opportunity. Locking up customers everywhere they shop Amazon Lockers make it convenient for customers to purchase items and pick them up at a time and location that is convenient for them, and it installed hundreds of Click & Collect lockers in places like campus bookstores and convenience stores. Office supplies retailer Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) and electronics shop Radio Shack also signed on, believing much like Target that they were providing their customers a service. If someone bought something on Amazon and picked it up at a local Staples, maybe they'd also buy a ream of paper while they were in the store. But what they quickly found was that they were simply giving Amazon more sales and weren't realizing much if any benefit from the increased foot traffic. Both Staples and Radio Shack dropped out of the experiment. Target's decision to restock Amazon gadgets is different though because customers can still buy a Kindle just about anywhere. Although Best Buy almost went out of business due to customers "show rooming" products in their stores before buying them on Amazon, it continued to carry the gadgets. And they're virtually available anywhere anyway, as you can even pick them up at a Bed Bath & Beyond store. Heck, even Staples carries them. Target customers will once again be able to fill their shopping carts with Amazon gadgets as the mass merchandiser realized it was only cutting its own nose off by not stocking them. Image source: Mike Mozart via Flickr. So Target wasn't so much hurting Amazon by not carrying them, but was cutting its own nose off to spite its face. By not having them in stock, it was forcing its customers to shop elsewhere for them, customers who might otherwise have shopped its stores. In the four years since Target and Wal-Mart dropped the gadgets, the ability with which consumers can switch their allegiance to a retailer has only gotten easier. If they can't find a product in one location they'll shop someplace else. And because Amazon's Prime membership has become so prevalent with some 45 million households, it's become immaterial whether Target carries it or not so the retailer likely believes it may as well make it as convenient as possible for its customers. It is the internet Of course, Amazon has grown exponentially over time and being cut off did nothing to staunch its growth. Net sales went from $48 billion in 2011 to $89 billion last year, a near-17% compounded annual growth rate, while Target's revenues, in comparison, went from $69 billion five years ago to $74 billion in 2015, or less than 2% compounded growth annually. Wal-Mart's sales also grew 2% a year. While being kicked out of Target stores obviously didn't hurt Amazon, reintroduction to the retailer's 1,800 stores can only help. And if Wal-Mart follows suit, it would net it even millions of more potential customers who would be exposed to its lineup of gadgets (though Wal-Mart's $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com suggests it only plans on competing harder against Amazon, not retreating). Target, though, was caught in a tough place, and as smart as the move may have been in 2011, Friday's decision is equally on point. As the saying goes, it pays to keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. Rich Duprey has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The baby's father, who works at the store in the suburb of Helotes, told officers that he forgot to drop his son off at day care before going to work about 6:15 a.m. Friday, said Helotes police Capt. Anthony Burges. The father found his child dead after finishing work and returning to the SUV about 3 p.m. The father was taken to a hospital after reporting chest pains, Burges said. No charges have been filed, and the identities of the father and boy have not been released. Temperatures in the area hovered around 100 degrees much of the afternoon. The death brings the number of children who have died in hot cars in the U.S. this year to at least 27, six in Texas, said Janette Fennell, founder and president of KidsAndCars.org, a national child safety nonprofit based in Philadelphia. On Aug. 4, twin 15-month-old girls died after being found in the back seat of a hot SUV parked in front of a duplex car Carrollton in northwestern Georgia. When police arrived, they found people holding the girls in the water of a baby pool behind the duplex, some with ice packs, trying to cool the girls off. Last year, there were 15 heatstroke deaths of children in vehicles, Fennell said. The toll began rising sharply in the 1990s with the passing of laws requiring that young children be placed in the back seat to avoid air-bag injuries. With the children strapped into the back seat, drivers can tend to forget them, Fennell said. Fennell said the numbers of heatstroke deaths of kids in cars fluctuated in the following decades, averaging 37 such deaths a year since 1998. The worst year was 2010, with 49, according to both a count by Fennell and Jan Null, a research meteorologist at San Jose State University, who also tracks numbers. The temperature inside a parked car on a 90-degree day will reach 119 degrees in 20 minutes and 133 degrees after an hour, Null said. Parents should get into the habit of always opening their back doors when they leave the vehicle, according to Fennell. Leaving a purse or cellphone in the back seat can help. Parents also need to make sure their day care calls them if the child doesn't show up, she said. ←Older Newer→ Updated : 2016-11-24 03:04 GMT+08:00 MOST POPULAR Strasbourg's Christmas market at Taipei 101 20 Thanksgiving dining options in Taipei Thailand waives visa fee for Taiwan, 18 nations Taipei high school opens first gender-neutral restrooms in Taiwan Canadian man savagely beats Taiwanese girlfriend on Taipei street Meet Hualien's Famous British Barber Google Map of Taiwan's Demolished and Burned Cultural Assets Taiwanese woman opts for 'Stateless' over being branded 'Chinese' on Iceland ID Torrential rain warnings issued for northern Taiwan Current foreign workers program outdated and unreasonable: KMT lawmaker About Us Contact Us Taiwan News © 2016 All Rights Reserved.

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen A south Okanagan RV park owner is speaking out about a tradition that has been taking a bite out of businesses like his for many years: free overnight parking at a local supercentre. Harvey Anweiler is part owner of South Beach Gardens RV Park and Campground in Penticton. Harvey Anweiler is the owner of the South Beach Gardens RV Park and Campground in Penticton. Story continues below He says for years, he’s faced tough competition, not from other campsites but from the Walmart parking lot.  Each day, RVs from all over pull in, to take advantage of the free overnight parking. The RV community has long known about an open door policy at Walmart parking lots. The company’s own website confirms that RV’ers are allowed to stay on Walmart properties overnight if they are given approval by store management and if it does not interfere with other ordinances. “It’s hard to compete against free parking,” Anweiler said. What the RV’ers in the Penticton Walmart parking lot might not realize is that overnight parking does interfere with the City of Penticton’s bylaws. “Well in terms of our zoning, we don’t allow overnight camping in commercial spaces,” Mayor of Penticton Andrew Jakubeit said. Jakubeit said the city has received numerous complaints, and plans to take action. Its going to help Walmart install bigger signs indicating the bylaw restrictions; then bylaw officers will start handing out warnings. “So it’s a little bit of an education process and I think that’s the first step,” Jakubeit said. © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Travelers zoom past, never knowing what lies beyond, and locals start patronizing newly accessible superstores. The historic downtown Main Streets wither and fade. This has been small-town America’s fate since the 1950s. But in rural south-central Ohio, communities long hanging by a thread are finding unique ways to weave that thread into a bootstrap and pull themselves back up toward prosperity. In Nelsonville, that bootstrap might be literally attached to a boot. Rocky Shoes and Boots, founded in 1932 and now an international, publicly traded company, never left the area (not completely, anyway) and is one of several key partners in Nelsonville’s fledgling revival. In Logan, some 12 miles west of Nelsonville on U.S. 33 — the highway that hit both towns so hard — Bill Saving and other local entrepreneurs are likewise digging in. What does it take to bring new life to a ghost town? “A few people going out on a limb,” Mr. Saving said. “Logan has been hurting, but it’s slowly coming back.” When tourists amble into Saving Hardware, with its antique counters, quirky items and well-stocked shelves, he said, they tend to remark, “Oh, this is a real hardware store.” Though the sign out front has sported Mr. Saving’s family name for six decades, these days Saving Hardware must compete with the Wal-Mart 2 miles away by “doing the stuff they don’t — customer service, renting tools and repairing windows and glass.” “You gotta find your niche,” Mr. Saving said. Saving the whole region, to this regular visitor’s eyes, is its growing tourist industry. But how individual businesses and towns survive or even thrive is, yes, by finding unique niches that appeal to both locals and tourists. Logan — the bigger city, with just over 7,000 residents — is perfectly situated as the gateway to the Hocking Hills, “Ohio’s Scenic Wonderland.” Geological wonders and year-round activities draw people to abundant state parks, nature preserves and a national forest. People also flock to good restaurants more numerous than either town’s population alone could support. Logan, celebrating its bicentennial with a big fair in September, also draws crowds with oddities like the washboard music festival each June. Why washboards? Because Columbus Washboard Company — the nation’s last — still operates there. Townspeople decorate for the festival by hanging lines of laundry across the streets, but it’s really all about the roots of rock and Appalachian music. The smaller city of Nelsonville is just far enough away from Logan that it doesn’t draw as many nature tourists as it would like, said city manager Gary Edwards, but there are signs that years of fitful reinvestment might finally be reaching the proverbial tipping point. The new “eds and meds” economy is working some magic: A small OhioHealth facility is under construction at the nearby U.S. 33 interchange, and on Nelsonville’s beautiful town square, Hocking College’s hospitality studies department operates an excellent restaurant. The city manager’s favorite new story of progress, though, features the century-old high school. After its abandonment in the 1990s, a group of elderly alumnae kept it going as a multipurpose center, scraping together funds for a few windows or roof repair. In recent months, a specialty developer has bought the stately building and will renovate it with apartments and office space. The first big tenant? Rocky Brands. Manufacturing went overseas years ago, but the company will expand its call center into the repurposed school while its cool, retro-industrial outlet store continues to thrive just a block or two away. There’s one potential draw I’d like to see the city capitalize on. Roadside signs proclaim Nelsonville as “home of the famous Star Brick” but it has been years since the once-plentiful kilns were in business. Longtime homeowners who remove sidewalks and driveways of the beautiful, glazed 11-pound pavers — molded with stars, flowers or bull’s-eyes — find them snapped up for new developments like that OhioHealth facility. Ohio still has plenty of clay — ask any gardener — and Americans increasingly seek out unusual things and experiences. Ralph Boll, a brick dealer and historian, is on a crusade to revive brick-making as an interactive tourist attraction. “We have to give people a reason to visit,” he said. In this tale of two tiny cities, citizens can take heart in remembering that both Rocky Brands and Saving Hardware were founded at the bottom of the Great Depression. Hard times have a way of clarifying our choices and prodding us to take risks. The decades will prove it was worth it.

Amazon barely makes dent in DIY stores' sales MarketWatch 8/14/2016 By Paul Ziobro Do-it-yourself chains Home Depot Inc. and Lowe's Cos. appear to have built a retail oasis mostly walled off from the reach of online behemoth Amazon.com Inc. Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 778.56 -6.77 -0.86% Lowe's Companies Inc LOW ▲ 71.84 +0.25 +0.35% Macy's Inc M ▲ 44.92 +0.46 +1.03% Kohl's Corp KSS ▼ 55.55 -0.11 -0.20% Their uniqueness in the retail landscape will be driven home next week as the two chains report second-quarter earnings. Analysts project sales at existing stores will rise 4.8% at Home Depot and 4% at Lowe's, according to data provider FactSet. That would mark the eighth straight quarter of at least 4% year-over-year growth for each company. Such gains are the envy of other retailers. Kohl's Corp., Macy's Inc. and Nordstrom Inc. each recently posted ongoing sales declines amid difficulty getting more people to shop in their stores. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which reports its fiscal second-quarter results on Thursday, is projecting a small same-store sales gain, while Target Corp., whose quarterly earnings are due Wednesday, has projected a sales dip. The retailers that have reported earnings thus far have pointed to slightly improving trends from earlier in the year. But they also have seen their business models upended by the rise of online shopping that reduces the need to visit a store for a sweater or blender. Macy's is responding by closing 100 locations. Executives from the home improvement chains cite a litany of favorable housing trends for their good fortunes. New households are being formed and housing turnover remains steady. Millennials are even willing to buy homes, albeit six years later than normal, according to Home Depot. All that spurs trips to large chains to pick out appliances and paint colors, and plan projects around the home. About two-thirds of U.S. homes are also more than 30 years old, Home Depot says, requiring more spending on upkeep. Low interest rates and rising home values -- which are now just 2% below their July 2006 peak, according to S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices -- make replacing a roof, or even updating a kitchen, more palatable, as homeowners view their homes as investments, not expenses. Such trends have kept the home-improvement sector growing well above the broader retail market. Sales at home-improvement chains and similar stores are up 6.4% through July versus the same period a year ago, according to the Commerce Department. In contrast, overall retail sales are up 2.8% during the same period. Only drugstores and restaurants this year among brick-and-mortar locations are outrunning the home improvement stores. Online sales, of course, are growing much faster, up 10.5% at non-store retailers this year, according to the same federal data. Much of that is coming from Amazon. But the e-commerce giant doesn't have a toehold in large parts of the home improvement space, like lumber, paint and gardening supplies. Home Depot says just 25% of its business -- smaller, easy-to-ship items like power drills and small hand tools -- faces tough online competition. That doesn't mean either chain is immune to Amazon. A UBS survey in June found that 11% of consumers planning a home improvement project themselves planned to buy something from Amazon. That is far behind the 36% who said they planned to shop at Home Depot and the 21% at Lowe's, but up from just 7% a few months back.

It isn’t just secretive, the way Apple is, but in a deeper sense, Jeff Bezos’ e-commerce and cloud-storage giant is opaque. Amazon rarely explains either its near-term tactical aims or its long-term strategic vision. It values surprise. To understand Amazon, then, is necessarily to engage in a kind of Kremlinology. That’s especially true of the story behind one of its most important business areas: the logistics by which it ships orders to its customers. Over the last few years, Amazon has left a trail of clues that suggests it is radically altering how it delivers goods. Among other moves, it has set up its own fleet of trucks; introduced an Uber-like crowdsourced delivery service; built many robot-powered warehouses; and continued to invest in a far-out plan to use drones for delivery. It made another splash last week, when it showed off an Amazon-branded Boeing 767 airplane, one of more than 40 in its planned fleet. These moves have fuelled speculation that Amazon is trying to replace the third-party shipping companies it now relies on — including UPS, FedEx and the US Postal Service — with its homegrown delivery service. Its logistics investments have also fed the general theory that Amazon has become essentially unbeatable in American e-commerce — no doubt one reason Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, felt the need this week to acquire an audacious Amazon rival, Jet.com, for $3.3 billion. So what’s Amazon’s ultimate aim in delivery? After talking to analysts, partners and competitors, and prying some very minimal input from Amazon itself, I suspect the company has a two-tiered vision for the future of shipping. First, it’s not trying to replace third-party shippers. Instead, over the next few years, Amazon wants to add as much capacity to its operations as possible, and rather than replace partners like UPS and FedEx, it is spending boatloads on planes, trucks, crowdsourcing and other novel delivery services to add to its overall capacity and efficiency. Amazon’s longer-term goal is more fantastical — and, if it succeeds, potentially transformative. It wants to escape the messy vicissitudes of roads and humans. It wants to go fully autonomous, up in the sky. The company’s drone program, which many in the tech press dismissed as a marketing gimmick when Bezos unveiled it on “60 Minutes” in 2013, is central to this future; drones could be combined with warehouses manned by robots and trucks that drive themselves to unlock a new autonomous future for Amazon. There are hurdles to realising this vision. Drone delivery in the United States faces an uncertain regulatory future, and there are myriad technical and social problems to iron out. Still, experts I consulted said that a future populated with autonomous drones is closer at hand than one populated with self-driving cars. “It’s a vastly easier problem — flying than driving,” said Keller Rinaudo, the co-founder of Zipline, a drone-delivery startup that will begin deploying a system to deliver medical goods in Rwanda this fall. “If we had regulatory permission, we’d be delivering to your house right now,” he added, referring to the San Francisco Bay Area. If Amazon’s drone program succeeds (and Amazon says it is well on track), it could fundamentally alter the company’s cost structure. A decade from now, drones would reduce the unit cost of each Amazon delivery by about half, analysts at Deutsche Bank projected in a recent research report. If that happens, the economic threat to competitors would be punishing — “retail stores would cease to exist,” Deutsche’s analysts suggested, and we would live in a world more like that of “The Jetsons” than our own. Shipping has always been at the core of Amazon’s strategic investments. In its earliest days, as part of an effort to avoid collecting sales tax from most customers, Amazon purposefully placed warehouses in low-tax, low-population states, and then shipped goods to populous areas within three to five days. The 2005 introduction of Amazon’s Prime subscription program, which gives customers two-day delivery on many goods for an annual price of $99 (Rs 6,610), changed Amazon’s shipping needs. Prime encouraged customers to buy a lot more stuff, and it also forced Amazon to deliver packages more quickly. That explains why Amazon abandoned its tax-avoidance strategy earlier this decade and began building dozens of warehouses in populous areas. It also ramped up a system called “postal injection,” in which it uses prediction algorithms and complicated network analysis to figure out how to deliver every package to the US postal facility nearest a customer’s house. According to Deutsche, postal injection has allowed Amazon to slash the cost of the most expensive leg of shipping an item, the “last mile” from a warehouse to customers’ homes. So despite shipping most goods faster, between 2010 and 2015 Amazon cut its shipping costs from $5.25 (Rs 351) per box to $4.26 (Rs 267), Deutsche estimates. But that’s still not low enough. Though Amazon has released a string of stellar earnings reports recently, its shipping costs are rising, and it faces capacity constraints. During the holidays two years ago, a surge of online orders overwhelmed UPS, leading to missed deliveries. A more severe problem looms in the long run: The transportation infrastructure in the United States is aging, and the Department of Transportation has warned that unless urgent and expensive fixes are made, roads, waterways, airports and other systems will become alarmingly clogged by the 2040s. For Amazon, that projected future is catastrophic: Pretty much all of Amazon’s current investments in shipping — in trucks, planes and crowdsourced delivery cars — depend on the traditional shipping infrastructure. All, that is, except for drones — which explains why they are integral to Amazon’s vision of the future of retail. I was first clued in to the importance of Amazon’s drone initiative, called Amazon Prime Air, when I met Gur Kimchi, the head of the program, at an industry conference a few months ago. Though our conversation was off the record, Kimchi’s detailed answers to my questions suggested I had been too quick to dismiss the initiative. When I began talking to others in the drone industry about Amazon’s interest in autonomous flight, they all pointed out that drones offer a way to leapfrog roads. Because they operate in a new, untrammeled layer of physical space — below 400 feet, an airspace that is currently unoccupied in most of the country — they open up a vast new shipping lane. Beyond posting several videos, Amazon has not revealed much publicly about its drone program, but it has been working with regulators worldwide to set up tests of the system. It envisions drones being able to deliver packages up to five pounds in weight, which account for 80 to 90 percent of its deliveries. Amazon also said it has built many different kinds of prototypes for different delivery circumstances. The first rollouts will likely be in low- and medium-density areas like suburbs, where a drone might land in a backyard to drop off shoes. But the company said it was also working on systems to deliver to cities — for instance, drones could deliver packages to smart lockers positioned on rooftops. As it happens, the shipping company DHL has tested just such a drone-to-locker delivery system in Germany; a representative told me that the test was a success and that it plans to expand the technology depending on regulatory approval. Amazon’s patent filings hint at even more fanciful possibilities — drones could ferry packages between tiny depots housed on light poles, for example. Others project even wilder ideas. Ryan Petersen, the founder of the logistics software company Flexport, pointed out that Amazon had filed patents that envision using trucks as mobile shipping warehouses. Such self-driving trucks, prestocked with items Amazon has determined a given neighborhood might need, could roam around towns. When an order comes in, a drone might fly from the truck to a customer’s house, delivering the item in minutes. Scenes like that are most likely in the far-off future. But according to Amazon, the earliest incarnation of drone deliveries will happen much sooner — we will see it within five years, somewhere in the world.

Andrew AbramsonContact Reporter Tim Canova holds his own in debate against Debbie Wasserman Schultz Privacy Policy Tim Canova’s months-long quest to debate Debbie Wasserman Schultz ended before breakfast Sunday morning, frustrating the law professor as much as it empowered him.  Canova finally received equal billing to his established opponent in the Democratic primary, facing her for one hour — minus commercial breaks — on WFOR-4’s Facing South Florida with Jim DeFede. With about 45 minutes of total air time in a debate that began at 8 a.m., DeFede focused on the Democratic National Committee’s e-mail scandal and Wasserman Schultz’ role in it, Canova’s lack of experience, and a few of the hottest topics in South Florida — medical marijuana, minimum wage, social security and Israel.  The time restrictions didn’t provide Canova with much of an opportunity to paint Wasserman Schultz as a shill for Wall Street and U.S. Sugar. He threw in his lobs, and called for more debates that would address issues that impact the black and Hispanic communities. Wasserman Schultz unsurprisingly turned them down, citing limited time before the Aug. 30 primary. She has little to gain from more debates. This was Canova’s one shot and it was all on Wasserman Schultz’s terms. She scheduled the debate with DeFede, forcing Canova to agree to it after he repeatedly said he’d debate anywhere, anytime. The 8 a.m. start time fuels the argument that Wasserman Schultz only wants to hold debates at inconvenient hours with limited viewership. As DNC chair, she negotiated Saturday night presidential primary debates.  Canova held his own against Wasserman Schultz, a skilled debater despite rarely having meaningful competition in her 11-year Congressional career. But there was no game changer, no moment where a soft Wasserman Schultz supporter would likely jump to Canova’s side.  That doesn’t mean that the voters in U.S. House District 23 already suspicious of Wasserman Schultz will feel at ease after Sunday’s debate.  She hardly sounds remorseful about the fallout from the DNC scandal, which forced her to resign as DNC chair on the eve of the Democratic convention. She once again argued that the leaked e-mails, depicting frustration at the Bernie Sanders campaign among DNC staffers, is secondary to the real issue of “Russian espionage.” She’s blaming the Russians for hacking the DNC. Tim Canova, Debbie Wasserman Schultz debate on WFOR-4 (Andrew Abramson) Sanders is a Canova fundraiser and Canova admitted that 90 percent of his contributions — which totaled $2.2 million on the last filing report — comes from outside of Florida. Wasserman Schultz’ last report showed $2.8 million in contributions.   Canova said he wasn’t sure how much of the 10 percent of donations raised in Florida came from District 23, which stretches from Miami Beach north of Dania Beach and as far west as Weston.    “I have not broken it down and analyzed that,” Canova said.  The district, which is heavily Democratic but favors an establishment candidate, voted 68-31 for Clinton over Sanders in the March 15th primary. That remains Canova’s toughest obstacle.  DeFede questioned Canova’s knowledge of the district. In one of the most memorable exchanges, DeFede asked Canova if he knew the name of the mayor of Southwest Ranches.  “No, I do not and I’m not going to play the game,” he balked.  Wasserman Schultz jumped in, telling Canova it’s Jeff Nelson and that “he’s an assistant principal at Cypress Bay High School.”  “I do know who my students are at Nova Southeastern University,” Canova said. “For the last four years I’ve taught hundreds and hundreds of students there. I’ve spent more time in the district in the last four years than the Congresswoman has.”  Score that one to Wasserman Schultz, who was a state representative at age 26 and is deeply embedded in the community.  Canova was also questioned on his decision to leave the Democratic party and register as an independent. He said the Democratic departure was only for one election cycle and that he’s once again a registered Democrat. He used it as an opportunity to attack Wasserman Schultz on her ties to big business.  “It was a feeling that the Democratic party had moved away from me and it had become much more corporate-dominated, quite frankly, under the Congresswoman’s leadership at the DNC,” he said.  That might play well to disillusioned liberals, but it doesn’t help Canova in the party-friendly district.  On the issues, Canova came across as a strong progressive on topics like income inequality, explaining how Wal Mart is so stingy with its workers that a large percentage of them are on food stamps. Wal Mart, in turn, is one of the largest recipients of food stamps.  Canova also favors a smart drug policy, believing that the use of marijuana and some hard drugs should be treated as a “public health issue” instead of overcrowding prisons with drug users.  Wasserman Schultz, who has been slow to embrace medical marijuana in Florida but said she now favors it, fought Canova’s argument that she is not progressive enough for South Florida.  “I have consistently stood up on behalf of the working people and fought side by side working for the people of this district,” she said.  In her district, she’s sufficiently liberal. But there’s no doubt she’s to the right of Canova on some social and economic issues. Canova’s Israel policy, and his inability to articulate a portion of it during Sunday’s debate, won’t help him with more moderate voters.  Canova wrote on his web that “the U.S. must do everything in its power to reverse the militarization of the region, including full diplomatic efforts to negotiate a general disarmament for the entire region that includes nuclear, missile, and conventional arms reductions.” Wasserman Schultz jumped on it.  “What is of the utmost importance is Israel’s security which is why it is disturbing that my opponent has been anything but certain when it comes to his position on Israel,” she said. Canova responded that he “never singled out Israel whatsoever. I would not be talking about Israel as the problem.”  “The last time I checked, Israel is in the Middle East,” Wasserman Schultz countered.  DeFede then responded that “to my knowledge, Israel is the only state in that region who has nuclear weapons.” “I’ll state categorically right now that I was not referring to Israel,” Canova said. “I am a strong defender of the state of Israel.”   Canova supports a two-state solution and said it will require “difficult compromises” by both Israel and Palestine. It’s a popular position to the far left, including many younger progressives, who have embraced pro-Palestinian causes. But in South Florida, which has one of the world’s largest Jewish populations, he didn’t help himself on the Israel question.  Canova pointed out that Wasserman Schultz, who is Jewish, voted for the Iran deal. Many of her Jewish Congressional colleagues, including Ted Deutch, Lois Frankel and Chuck Schumer, were against it.  While that doesn’t help Wasserman Schultz with some of the hard-lined Jewish community, she rightly pointed out that the deal has made Iran less of a nuclear threat, even as the United States repays a $1.7 billion debt to Iran that could potentially be used to support terrorism.  Call it a wash on Israel. Wasserman Schultz may have lost some Jewish support after backing the Iran deal, but Canova’s Israel policy won’t make him more attractive to those voters.  Canova, who filed a Federal Elections Commission complaint against Wasserman Schultz last week, continued to criticize her for using DNC resources to monitor the primary campaign. The e-mail leak showed that DNC staffers were involved in coordinated attacks against Canova.  Wasserman Schultz has denied any wrongdoing. This will continue to embolden voters who don’t trust her.  For the first time in her Congressional career, Wasserman Schultz has a Democratic opponent and he’s no pushover. Voters have two intelligent candidates to choose from and it’s unfortunate that there’s not a series of debates on the wide range of issues impacting South Florida. Fracking, an important topic in Florida, was only briefly discussed at the end of the debate. Wasserman Schultz favors it if it's "strongly regulated." Canova is against it, and his supporters have been outwardly critical of Wasserman Schultz's stance.  Canova simply didn’t and probably couldn’t do enough in the lone debate to drastically change the narrative.  Copyright © 2016, Sun Sentinel All Sections News Sports Broward Palm Beach Entertainment Classified Obituaries 79°

My curiosity is piqued, it’s actually “berry flavoured” green tea, she informs me. The law practitioner is regarded as an “up-and-coming” lawyer in the field of competition law by various international legal publications, including Legal500 and Chambers Global. She was also listed as a recommended competition lawyer in Legal500, in 2015. She is soft-spoken, but her voice commands authority. I am in the presence of a leader. Her passion and enthusiasm for competition law is evident. A pioneer in her field, her work involves investigating the abuse of dominance and cartels, dawn raids and regulatory compliance. Originally from Stellenbosch, she acquired her master’s degree in commercial law at the University of South Africa (Unisa), cum laude. Her eyes light up as she explains how her career in law began. What drew you towards law and more specifically competition law? One of the most daunting things to do is to decide what to study as an 18 year old as you are so young, and you know so little of what is out there in the big wide world. I studied a BCom LLB which initially appealed to me as its broadness would give me the scope to branch out into economics, finance or law. As I really enjoyed the legal side of the degree, I then completed a two-year LLB at Stellenbosch. I also took up economics, which has been invaluable as a competition lawyer. Do you consider yourself a pioneer in the competition law space? Competition is a relatively new industry in law. It has only been around for the last 10 to 15 years, where other areas of law are well developed and have existed for hundreds of years. This presents a great opportunity for competition lawyers to make their mark early on in their careers and carve a niche for themselves within this growing area.  It’s a great area of law for development of young people. I am fortunate in that I got to be one of the people who could really excel in this industry from early on in my career. What do you enjoy most about your job? Dawn raids. I have recently done two of these. The Competition Commission arrives with police at an office, unannounced, to conduct a search and seizure operation. We go with big teams of up to 40 people. Varsity can’t prepare you for this. You need to be able to think on your feet.   I also enjoy the diversity of cases I work on. I have had clients ranging from cement manufacturers and financial institutions to poultry farmers and locksmiths. You learn so much on the job as you need to understand each industry in which you represent a client. You also need to understand your client's business. You quickly become an expert in diverse industries and businesses. You can never get bored in this job and you will never stop learning. What are some of the challenges to South Africa’s global competitiveness? There have been a few instances over the years where international companies have tried to invest in South Africa, examples include Walmart and AB InBev. Some of the issues raised in the competition sphere are related to public interest, such as job security for local workers and protection of local industry. This is a difficult balancing act to get right. On the one hand we want to protect the interests of our people and economy. At the same time we want to be an investor-friendly jurisdiction. If we are overly protective, we may lose out on opportunities. It is important that as a country we avoid uncertainty in the business environment. If we can work at being a jurisdiction of more regulatory certainty I think it would be helpful to position ourselves as a more business friendly international destination. What do you consider some of your greatest achievements? When I started my articles at Deneys Reitz, before the merging with Norton Rose in 2011, my focus was on the South African market. After the merging, we became a global law firm which exposed me to an international platform. The global nature of the firm gave me the opportunity to speak on international panels, meet international lawyers and engage with some of the top regulators in the world.  It is amazing to participate on an international platform from a legal perspective. I am fortunate to be the head of the competition team, at a relatively young age (33). I also head up the life science and healthcare group. It is an exciting place to be, there will always be a need for affordable healthcare on the continent and it is one of the areas that is growing across Africa.  Norton Rose Fulbright provides great leadership opportunities in a supportive environment and gives you freedom to have a vision and influence strategy. How would you describe your leadership style? I believe that law is a people’s business. When you are younger, you think that law is a lot about just reading and arguing, but at the end of the day, your clients are people, with problems, and the team you work with consists of people. So I would describe my style as people focused. I am also direct in the way I approach people and situations. Time is the rarest commodity in the world and I am mindful of the fact that we all have time limitations. What are some challenges you had to deal with? This is a job you have to be passionate about. Lawyers work very hard and they do not always get immediate gratification for their work. The nature of the industry is that if a client has a challenge, they need help immediately, regardless of the time. You really must be passionate and committed. The global economy has also been challenging and the legal industry has not been immune. You have to work smarter, and find more efficient ways of providing value to clients. It is an extremely competitive world and you have to be agile and provide an excellent service to come out on top. What are some major lessons you learnt? You really have to work hard, there are no shortcuts in the industry. Because it’s a people’s business, a lot of your success depends on your attitude, work ethic and ability to get along with others. Lawyers are strong personality types and it is important to not take yourself too seriously. You must learn to enjoy the environment, enjoy what you do and seize opportunities. I also think I have had to learn to be more thick skinned. The legal environment by nature is one where people disagree and take different views. It is not personal. Who inspires you? Thuli Madonsela. We need more people like her in the world. Yasmin Carrim, who is a member on the Competition Tribunal. I think she has done a good job being a regulator in the competition  area. I also admire people who come from difficult backgrounds and who enter the system and make a success of it. How do you maintain a work-life balance? It is impossible to do everything and you need to understand that something is going to have to give. It is a matter of priorities on how you spend your time. Well-being comes in different forms for different people. For me, exercise is important. I am a firm believer in family and spend time as much time as I possibly can with my family. I am fortunate to have a supportive family. Without that support structure, it would be very difficult. * August is Women's Month and Fin24, in collaboration with the Sanlam Enterprise Supplier Development Programme, invites you to help us celebrate and showcase SA's extraordinary women in business.

Published Aug 14th, 2016 8:38 am roby@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas With the wild success of fundraising in Northwest Arkansas for an Arkansas Children’s Hospital campus, CEO Marcy Doderer says there are a number of additional initiatives underway to expand children’s health services in nearly every corner of the state. Appearing on this week’s edition of Talk Business & Politics, Doderer said that the Northwest Arkansas campus is being built with future growth in mind. “We designed the campus thinking not just in the next 5 or 10 years, but really looking out 20 or 30 years,” she said. At last week’s Children’s Hospital fundraising gala in Northwest Arkansas, Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said the region is on pace to grow to more than 1 million residents over the next 15 years. “If that is really the pace of growth, we will have to accelerate our plan for expansion,” Doderer said. “The building we’re designing is easily expandable. We’re actually building it such that we can grow, we can build without disrupting services that are open.” Children’s Hospital has successfully secured commitments for $53 million of its $70 million capital campaign for a facility in Springdale. Doderer says community leaders view it as an investment. “Our goal was to be at around $45 million by this time and just the generosity of spirit of the folks up there has been tremendous,” she said. “I would say, they really see it as an investment. It’s not a gift to charity to them. It really is investing in their communities, it’s investing in their families, and it’s investing in their businesses. It’s a great recruitment for the big businesses there.” However, Doderer said there is much more at work in rural parts of the state and in the capital city. “Seventy-five counties, over 75,000 kids. How do we get pediatric care close to home for all of them? The answer is not easy, but there’s a few things that are happening that I think you’ll see play out pretty shortly,” Doderer said. She noted: A USDA grant of more than $600,000 for telemedicine units in 42 rural schools statewide. It will connect school nurses with pediatricians at Children’s Hospital in real time. The program will test this fall in Benton before a larger statewide rollout to school districts with fewer than 5,000 kids. A mobile health unit that will travel in south Arkansas to provide services in rural communities without significant pediatric care, but Doderer said further donations are needed for the project. Negotiations with the city of Little Rock to announce a new primary care clinic in southwest Little Rock by the end of August. Watch her full interview in the video below.

Minyanville SPX Earnings Update: Ex-Energy, Q2 '16 Earnings Grew +0.4% By Scutify Aug 14, 2016 9:21 am PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. With Walmart's (NYSE:WMT) earnings report this coming week, the Q2 '16 earnings season unofficially comes to an end. Ex-Energy, (and per Factset), the S&P 500 grew earnings in Q2 '16 +0.4% and grew revenue +2.5%. Thomson Reuters data (by the numbers): Forward 4-quarter estimate: $125.88 versus $126.12 last week. P.E ratio: 17(x) PEG ratio: 11.83(x) S&P 500 earnings yield: 5.76%. The S&P 500 hasn't been above a 6% earnings yield since June 24th. Year-over-year growth of the forward estimate: +1.47% versus last week's +1.48% and still disappointingly subdued. If you are overweight Tech and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for Q2 '16 earnings, your portfolio saw a nice bounce in July. Financials, the other large market cap weighting in the S&P 500, continues to trade like it has a piano on its back. For nine months now, my own expectation for earnings growth is that the 'forward 4-quarter growth rate" would gradually start to rise, and for nine months that expectation has been wrong, even though the S&P 500 has broken out to new all-time-highs. Talk about being right for the wrong reasons. This article was written by Brian Gilmartin for Investing.com on Aug 13, 2016.

Asda, Britain's number two retailer, is offering customers a chance to be scanned and made into a detailed miniature figurine, using a 3D printer. As Joanna Partridge reports, the trial at its York store in northern England is also being closely watched by Asda's U.S. parent company Wal-Mart. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript It's not what you'd usually pick up during your weekly shop - a mini version of yourself. But UK supermarket Asda is offering customers the chance to be scanned - and turned into 3D-printed figurine. They've started trialling the service at their York store in northern England. Victoria Cumberland only popped in for some tights, but decided to buy a model to give to her grandchildren. SOUNDBITE: Victoria Cumberland, Asda shopper, saying (English): "Quite why I would want one of me, but they could always stick pins in it, can't they." Having your whole body scanned takes between 2-3 minutes. The scanner takes around 15 frames a second, or 1000 per scan. The scanner can read colour as well as geometry. That means it reads the contours of the body along with the colour of the clothes you're wearing. After the scan, the image is processed by a computer and then sent to be printed with coloured ceramic fluid. Each 8-inch figure takes around 8 hours to produce and the printer can create several at once. Scanning slots were fully booked on the first trial days - with some customers travelling miles to get one. And they were many different reasons for wanting a figurine, says Phil Stout, Asda's head of Personalisation. SOUNDBITE: Phil Stout, Head of Personalisation, Asda, saying (English): "A gentleman came in, an older gentleman, came in earlier and his wife is in a care home, and he doesn't get to see his wife that often, so he wanted to do a scan to give to his wife as a present. I thought that was very touching." 3D printing is increasingly being used by industry. But Britain's second-biggest retailer believes it's the first supermarket to offer this service on a large scale and relatively cheaply. Each figure costs £40. Mark Ibbotson is Asda's Retail Director. He first saw the techology during a visit to the Innovation lab of Asda's U.S. parent company Wal-Mart. SOUNDBITE: Mark Ibbotson, Retail Director, Asda, saying (English): "Our customers are telling us they like new, they like innovation, and above all they like value. We saw an opportunity to bring a really innovative product to the market very quickly. I think we've tried all sorts of things, we've tried chocolate, we've tried printing phone cases, but this really does excite people." Wal-Mart will also be watching to see how the trial works out in the UK. But shoppers hoping for an unusual Christmas gift might be disappointed. Asda will roll out the service in the new year if it's a success - the response so far suggests it certainly will be.

August 14, 2016 at 9:08 a.m. Interesting that the inside page of today's Opinion section has a detailed and evidence supported look at the damage Voter ID laws are doing to voting rights. Voted ID laws are CAUSING fraudulent elections, disenfranchising thousands upon thousands of voters for every one possible case of voter fraud. Voter ID laws are the real frauds! Come on Greenberg, pull your head out of your backside orifice, and open your eyes to the facts about Voter ID laws and their negative affect on voters and voting. Clean that spit out of your eyes and quit spouting the lies of GOP powermongers. ( permalink | suggest removal ) ARMNAR says...

August 15, 2016 at 9:51 a.m. After bus loads of kenyans came over last elections to vote for their beloved son born there in kenya, and along with other aliens from beyond our solar system [ perhaps from the realm of barbelo, you know up there that ancients thought the divine council and angels and sons of man and sons of g-d and lesser imps and grandma live] all illegally voted twice and got Obama barely elected. Then after the SCOTUS tells us that there is no effort to impair voting, as the ink dried on the decision red states exploded the integrity voting system to stop so much voting being done which is costly to tabulate. Like the great state of Kansas, government should be inconvenient so that primates will quit using it except to build weapons of peace and allow the homeless 1% have summer homes for all 4 seasons. I remember Pennsylvanian where they had perhaps hundreds of millions of cases of illegal voting and the gop , being proud mericans and christiansnot moved to stop voting by unworthy voters, or as they call it , some who might vote democratic. What is wrong with white 21 males who own property being the voting ones. PG couldn't really hear you for all the one sided as usual mobius strip non lucid attempts to show why only the white aristocrats should run and own this country- just have the guts & integrity to say it instead of making up drunken sailor reasoning. I once saw a member of a deity system be accused in the ADG of sex crime, but after using up all my fingers and toes to count them I can to the conclusion there must be fact here. I find your lack of respect for America appalling as your bully pulpit is used to create a alternate universe to make the tyranny of the elite ,that Slak hates , powerful and trod over the regular USA primate. Just be honest and tell it like it is, you want plantations back as the natural order of things. I guess I missed your column about the industrial-military complex causing deaths to our troops, the prime rib catered lunches to the CEO's who destroy a company & then get a severance package greater than the yearly salary of all teachers in LR. PG you may make Fox seem fair & balanced. ( permalink | suggest removal ) kdc72701 says... August 15, 2016 at 11:24 a.m. Timber: early retirement? The man is sneaking up on 80 yo.

Super delegates voted for Hillary even when Bernie won the popular vote. And they say it isn't rigged. As a convicted felon, I am not allowed to vote. For the first time I'm thinking that's not necessarily a bad thing. I've not been carded at a liquor store in years. Why do I suddenly now have to show my license at Wal-Mart for a beer? Liquor stores got one more jab at grocery stores. Returning Iran's own money a scandal? Google Iran-Contra affair when Reagan and Bush were in office. Please educate yourselves folks before it's too late! As senator, Clinton promised 200,000 jobs in Upstate New York. Her efforts fell flat. Obama vetoed bill to limit past president's spending; staffers didn't have enough time to find jobs. Democrats, Hillary included, didn't worry about mine workers! Trump's expressed adoration of Russian President Putin reminds me of the reported adoration of Hitler by some Americans before World War II. About Clinton's Omaha speech: She finally has told the truth! She would raise taxes on the middle class while Warren Buffet applauds approvingly. Lately Donald Trump keeps stepping in one pile of doo-doo after another. The worst thing about it? It's his own. Haiti still waiting for those Clinton Foundation dollars. Another Clinton bait and switch. Trump Trash is someone who uses disrespect, suggestion, inciting violence and action to promote himself at the expense of others. Losers — his followers. If Corker wants to serve in a Trump cabinet, I suggest he get to Trump's kitchen and pick out a good cabinet. One he can make great. Trump will protect my grandchildren and children. This is my top priority. What is yours? Another week of Trump imploding. Hard to believe anyone's still supporting a racist, narcissistic, and completely incompetent candidate. All over but the crying Republicans! Remember New Orleans, Nice, even Chattanooga. With all the dirty laundry all the politicians talk about each other why should any of them be in office? Shame on us the voters. Free Press, thank you very much for your post-election endorsement of Congressman DesJarlais. It helped Scott's campaign tremendously. Coolidge Park belongs to all. And the area in question is frequently used by residents not tourists. No building, please. Save the people's park! States that vote Republican tend to have the lowest levels of education. Coincidence? Does anyone else think that maybe Donald really wants Hillary to win? His behavior in the last two weeks borders on insane. Wonder what happened to the 92 percent that wanted term limits? You just re-nominated all the same old tired career politicians. Why can't we watch the Olympics without all the verbiage? Why do TVAers think they should have better benefits than the rest of us? What's this I hear about a scheme to create an exclusive school district for the Town of Signal Mountain? The National Medal of Honor Museum is struggling to raise $100 million. What chance does the local museum have to raise a tenth of that? Kudos to Ooltewah High School and HCDE in choosing Coach Williams. He epitomizes honesty, character and decency. *** Got something on your mind? Tell us about it in 25 words or fewer.

News Sports Entertainment Obituaries Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds E-Edition log in Lakeland business celebrating 75 years Sunday Aug 14, 2016 at 12:01 AM By John CeballosThe Ledger LAKELAND — What started as a family-owned feed store at the corner of Florida Avenue and Pine Street in 1941 has since grown into a fertilizer business with 18 locations and 320 employees throughout the United States. But despite the nationwide growth, Harrell's LLC — a Lakeland-based producer and distributor of fertilizer and other agricultural chemicals — has experienced in the subsequent 75 years, the “family-owned” part has remained consistent. Jack Harrell Jr., 60, officially took the company's reins when his father, Jack, relinquished majority control in 2000 before his death in 2003. However, the duo had already been running Harrell's together for about a decade. “Sometime in the '90s, my dad came in and said, 'I just made you president and CEO,'” Harrell Jr. said. “I said, 'Do I do anything different?' and he said, 'Nope.' I asked, 'Do I get a pay raise?' and he said, 'You already get too much.' “It was a fun time working with him and growing this company together.” Ormond and Lucile Harrell, Jack Jr.'s grandparents, purchased the former Jensen's Feed Store and transformed it into Harrell's Feed Store, which opened Aug. 1, 1941. Ormond had previously worked at Lakeland Cash Feed and he remained at the head of the company until the mid-1950s when his son Jack took over. It was around that time that Harrell's shifted its focus toward fertilizer products. The business was also doing well enough that Harrell's opened five retail garden centers: two were in Lakeland, one was in Winter Haven and two were in Pinellas County. During his commutes to and from the retail locations in Polk and Pinellas, Jack began contacting golf courses as potential clients. “At that time, the golf courses were a hobby and he used the purchasing power from that to help buy better stuff for the stores,” Harrell Jr. said. Circumstances shifted when retailers like Kmart and Wal-Mart took a sizable bite out of their retail operation. “The 'Marts were beating us up on the retail side, so the hobby became a necessity.” Harrell Jr. estimates that 65 percent of the company's current business is related to golf courses, with 25 percent having to do with ornamental nursery producers and 10 percent dedicated to lawn care operators. The company's five retail centers all closed by the end of the '80s and Harrell's Feed Store downtown followed suit in the early '90s. “There was a store manager by the name of Bill Ritter who my grandfather had hired and had been with us for more than 50 years,” Harrell Jr. said. “When he retired, we closed the feed store. It was not our focus anymore, but we kept it going because the property was bought and paid for and it provided four jobs.” In the mid-1980s, Harrell's had built the distribution and production site — 51015 New Tampa Highway, Lakeland — that also serves as its corporate headquarters. Still, Harrell Jr. has fond memories of the feed store and says his father never put pressure on him to join the family business. “Dad never pushed it, but he always told us the opportunity was there,” he said. Harrell Jr., who has been married to wife Tina for 33 years, made a similar pitch to the couple's two sons; both Jack Harrell III, 31, and Will Harrell, 29, work for the family business. “Our deal with the boys was, 'We're not forcing you to come to Harrell's, but if you want to come we'd love to have you,'” Harrell Jr. said. “But there has to be a position, and you have to be qualified.” Harrell III has been with the company for more than seven years and is the director of inventory. He says working for his father has been rewarding on several levels. “On one hand, he's a successful business owner and I've learned a lot from him in that way,” Harrell III said. “Then there's the sentimental part of working alongside my father, which can lead to some interesting father-son/employee-employer discussions. “But he's been fantastic about giving me an opportunity to succeed.” Meanwhile, Will manages corporate compliance and government affairs and has been with Harrell's for about a year. “The reason this is a great place to work is because the people on this team are excellent and the best in the industry,” Will said. Harrell Jr. attributes the company's longevity to his faith and his dedicated workforce. “I have a Christian heritage that I inherited from my father and my grandfather,” said Harell Jr., who attends Trinity Presbyterian Church in Lakeland. “And even though we've got a lot of money tied up in buildings and equipment, our biggest asset is without a doubt our people.” Tim Rice, pastor at Trinity Presbyterian, has known Harrell Jr. since the early '90s. “He's humble, he has grace, and he doesn't believe he's any better than anyone else,” Rice said of Harrell Jr. The pastor also praised Harrell's generous spirit. “You go around this community, and if there's somebody doing good for others, you'll probably see a Harrell's plaque.” Throughout its 75 years, the company has supported organizations like Central Florida Speech and Hearing, Parker Street Ministries and Lakeland Regional Health. Harrell Jr. previously served as board chairman at Lakeland Regional Health. “He remains on our board of directors and leads with others our commitment to provide safe and world-class healthcare to those we serve,” said Elaine Thompson, president and CEO of Lakeland Regional Health, via email. “Jack is a passionate, wise and caring servant for this community.” The company's reach began to expand beyond Lakeland — and Florida — at the turn of the century. In January 2001, the company broke ground on its first out-of-state location in Sylacauga, Ala.. By the start of the following year, Harrell's had also acquired a facility in Norway, S.C. The company serves 10,000 customers from its 18 locations throughout the U.S., and its products are sold throughout the world. Harrell Jr. isn't about to stop innovating or serving his community just because the company has 75 years under its belt. “My philosophy is that you always have to figure out how to grow your business,” he said. “If not, you plateau. And if you plateau, you end up going down.” — John Ceballos can be reached at john.ceballos@theledger.com or 863-802-7515.

School supplies were handed out and vaccines and health screenings were given to children. Lauren Tostenson, KHOU 10:08 PM. CDT August 13, 2016 The Back To School Fest helped thousands of local families get ready for the new school year.  (Photo: KHOU 11 News) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Houston Independent School District starts school a week from Monday, and many parents are scrambling to check off everything on the supply list. It’s a process that can be stressful and expensive, but on Saturday, the Mayor’s Office worked to ease that burden for underprivileged Houstonians at the Back 2 School Fest. 25,000 low-income kids from across the Houston area made their way to the UH campus Saturday to take advantage of the one-stop-shop for Fall, all for free. “As far as buying supplies like at Walmart, getting it for free is a whole lot better, and we don’t have to worry about going and getting all the supplies we have it all right here,” said father of two, Kenya Bolden. However, it’s about more than just backpacks and pencils for many of these families. HISD alone claims a 76 percent student poverty rate, so the free dental check-ups, vaccines, and vision screenings provided were a big bonus for a lot of parents. The Care Van, one of 65 participating organizations, pitched in by providing immunizations. “Since we’ve been working in Houston, the Care Van has immunized over 250,000 children,” said a Care Van representative. On Saturday, the organization added to that number, getting thousands of students squared away on all the required vaccines. Meanwhile, the city’s Bureau of Oral Health took a look at thousands of teeth. “We have 12 dental chairs set up here, and what we’re doing is screening and providing sealants on molars and other permanent teeth, and fluoride varnish,” said dentist, Johanna DeYoung. 5-year-old Hector Ramirez passed his check-up with flying colors, which was a relief for his mom Diana. “I feel great, I mean he’s ready. He’s ready to go to school.” she said.  The event was a massive effort by the city, but it was worth it, considering it led to a massive burden lifted off thousands of needy families.

Baby found dead after being left all day in hot SUV in Texas Associated Press Twitter Facebook Email Reddit HELOTES, Texas – Authorities have released the name of an infant boy who died after being left all day in a hot sport utility vehicle in a San Antonio-area Wal-Mart parking lot. The Bexar County Medical Examiner’s Office on Saturday identified the 6-month-old infant as Dillon Martinez from San Antonio. Helotes police say the baby’s father told officers he forgot to drop his son off at day care before going to work about 6:15 a.m. Friday at the store. When the father returned to his SUV at 3 p.m., he found his child dead. A cause of death had not yet been determined, and no charges have been filed. The death brings the toll of children dying in hot cars this year to at least 27, six in Texas, said Janette Fennell, founder and president of KidsAndCars.org, a national child safety nonprofit based in Philadelphia. On Aug. 4, twin 15-month-old girls died after being found in the back seat of a hot SUV parked in front of a duplex in northwestern Georgia. When police arrived, they found people holding the girls in the water of a baby pool behind the duplex, some with ice packs, trying to cool the girls off. Last year, there were 15 heatstroke deaths of children in vehicles, Fennell said. The toll began rising sharply in the 1990s with the passing of laws requiring that young children be placed in the back seat to avoid air-bag injuries. With the children strapped into the back seat, drivers can tend to forget them, Fennell said. Fennell said the numbers of heatstroke deaths of kids in cars fluctuated in the following decades, averaging 37 such deaths a year since 1998. The worst year was 2010, with 49, according to a count by Fennell and Jan Null, a research meteorologist at San Jose State University. The temperature inside a parked car on a 90-degree day will reach 119 degrees in 20 minutes and 133 degrees after an hour, Null said. Parents should get into the habit of always opening their back doors when they leave the vehicle, according to Fennell. Leaving a purse or cellphone in the back seat can help. Other strategies include keeping a stuffed animal in the car seat and placing it in the front seat when the child is strapped in as a reminder that the child is there. Parents also need to make sure their day care calls them if the child doesn’t show up, she said.

Walmart’s fault? The Schuette’s Market store in Carlyle is closing. Provided i By Brian Brueggemann bbrueggemann@bnd.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story A grocery store that has operated in Carlyle for more than 70 years is closing. Schuette’s Markets, which also operates grocery stores in Troy, Highland and Breese, is closing its Carlyle location. Tessa Wiegman, vice president of administration for Schuette’s, said the Carlyle store has begun selling inventory at reduced prices. She expects the store to be closed by the end of August. “It was a tough decision for my family to make,” Wiegman said. “It was not made easily, I can tell you that.” She added, “It was kind of a plethora of reasons. First of all, the traffic in Carlyle has kind of shifted away from downtown. The people who come to Carlyle to utilize the lake, they have no reason to come downtown.” Carlyle has two other grocery stores, including a Super Walmart located closer to the lake. On the Carlyle store’s Facebook page, a number of Facebook users placed the blame squarely on Walmart. “We agree,” the store replied in one post. “It is sad for the community. Soon there will be very few independently-owned, mom-and-pop businesses.” &nbsp; The Carlyle store has been a fixture at the intersection of Illinois 127 and old U.S. 50. Under Schuette ownership, it was a Piggly Wiggly for many years, and then a Super Valu. In the past couple of years, the Schuette company has changed the name of all of its Supervalu stores to Schuette’s Markets. Schuette owns the Carlyle building and will be trying to sell it. “We have been talking with private companies to sell it. We will be putting it up for sale if we’re not able to sell it to these private companies,” Wiegman said. Wiegman said there are no plans to close any of the other Schuette’s locations. “Oh, no, no, no. All of the other stores are doing very well. We’re excited that we can focus on those now,” Wiegman said. She said all of the Carlyle employees have accepted positions at other Schuette’s Market locations, except for one, who was semi-retired and has chosen to fully retire. Several of the employees are going to the Breese store. “We know that a lot of our customers at Carlyle really like the employees there,” Wiegman said. “We’d be happy if those customers transitioned to the Breese store.” We know that a lot of our customers at Carlyle really like the employees there.

His death brings the number of children who have died in hot cars in the U.S. this year to at least 27, including six in Texas, said Janette Fennell, founder and president of KidsAndCars.org, a national child safety nonprofit based in Philadelphia. That's up from last year's total of 15. The baby's father, who works at the store in the suburb of Helotes, told officers that he forgot to drop his son off at day care before going to work about 6:15 a.m. Friday, said Helotes police Capt. Anthony Burges. The father found his child dead after finishing work and returning to the SUV about 3 p.m. Temperatures in the area hovered around 100 degrees much of the afternoon. The father was taken to a hospital after reporting chest pains, Burges said. No charges have been filed in the case. The name of the infant's father has not been released by authorities. The Bexar County Medical Examiner's Office on Saturday identified the infant as 6-month-old Dillon Martinez from San Antonio. Helotes police had initially said the infant was 7 months old. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and data collected by San Jose State University, the number of children dying of heat stroke in automobiles began to rise following the widespread introduction of passenger-side air bags in the 1990s. An increase in air-bag related fatalities of children in front seats prompted parents to buckle their children in rear seats, but while air bag-related fatalities began to decrease by 2000, the number of children dying of heat stroke rose due to children in back seats being less noticeable to parents and caregivers, according to researchers at San Jose State University. With the children strapped into the back seat, drivers can tend to forget them, Fennell said. Fennell said the numbers of heatstroke deaths of kids in cars fluctuated in the following decades, averaging 37 such deaths a year since 1998. The worst year was 2010, with 49, according to both a count by Fennell and Jan Null, a research meteorologist at San Jose State University, who also tracks numbers. This year, on Aug. 4, twin 15-month-old girls died after being found in the back seat of a hot SUV parked in front of a duplex car Carrollton in northwestern Georgia. When police arrived, they found people holding the girls in the water of a baby pool behind the duplex, some with ice packs, trying to cool the girls off. The temperature inside a parked car on a 90-degree day will reach 119 degrees in 20 minutes and 133 degrees after an hour, Null said. Parents should get into the habit of always opening their back doors when they leave the vehicle, according to Fennell. Leaving a purse or cellphone in the back seat can help. Parents also need to make sure their day care calls them if the child doesn't show up, she said. ___ This story has been corrected to show the infant was 6 months old, not 7 months.

Anthony Burges says the child’s father is employed at the store and told officers that he forgot to drop the child off at day care before going to work about 6:15 a.m. When he got off work about 3 p.m., he found his child dead. The father was taken to a hospital after reporting chest pains. No charges have been filed. Temperatures in the area hovered around 100 degrees in the area much of the afternoon. The temperature inside the car was estimated to be well over 140 degrees.

The baby was apparently left in the car for nearly nine hours, as the boy's father worked inside the store in Helotes, a suburb of San Antonio, KENS5 reported. The father told police he was supposed to drop the child off at daycare before arriving to work at 6:15 a.m., but he forgot. A bystander didn't notice the baby in the car until about 3:09 p.m. The father was taken into custody for questioning. It's unclear if he will face criminal charges. According to the report, temperatures reached 100 degrees for much of Friday afternoon.  About Us About Alabama Media Group Jobs at Alabama Media Group Advertise with us News In Education Frequently Asked Questions About AL.com Contact Us Online Store Already a Subscriber?

By Jon C. Ogg August 13, 2016 10:05 am EST Print Email Tweet Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) has had enough business problems of late to be monumental. China, Brazil, Russia and elsewhere are slow growth markets and have been for some time. The U.S. dollar strength also makes Caterpillar’s giant earth-moving and large transportation equipment more expensive outside of the United States. And then there is the slow capital spending climate and an environment in which there is excess used equipment that can be bought or leased. When you add all this up, it ought to be a situation in which the troubles linger on the stock. In reality, Caterpillar magically has been the best performing of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks so far in 2016. 24/7 Wall St. wanted to see what makes this possible. The first thing that needs to be noted is that Wall Street treats the stock market like a discounting mechanism. Investors are not just reacting to the news of today. They often have to try to be ahead of the curve, with an outlook that is six months out, or in some cases as long as 18 months out, in turnaround and value situations. Caterpillar’s year-to-date performance is 26%, almost three full points higher than Wal-Mart’s. The median gain on all Dow stocks is right at 6%, and the Dow itself is up 9.3% so far in 2016. Several big analyst calls have been made in 2016, some of which seem miniscule and some that are not: On July 27, Caterpillar was maintained as Sector Perform at RBC Capital Markets, but the price target was raised to $73 from $70, after having raised Caterpillar’s target to $70 from $68 back on April 25. On April 26, Argus raised Caterpillar to Buy from Hold with a $92 price target. On April 25, Goldman Sachs raised its rating to Neutral from Sell and put a $78 target on it, rather than the prior $62 target. That downgrade to Sell had been on January 25, with a $51 target, versus a then-current share price of $60.98. Caterpillar ended 2015 at $67.96, without adjusting for dividend payments made since then, and that was a total return of −23% in 2015, including its dividend adjustments. For 2016, the consensus price target from Thomson Reuters in the first week of January was $68.19, and now shares are right at $83.00. The consensus price target as of August 12, 2016, is $72.06. Another thing that makes Caterpillar’s top Dow stock position so surprising is that this was not expected at the start of 2016. When 24/7 Wall St. ran a 2016 bull-bear analysis for Caterpillar, the expected total return for Caterpillar was only 4.9% for the whole year (and that included its dividend yield of 4.53% at the time). It seems that the hoped for recovery in China is helping the situation here. The move in gold was entirely unexpected, and gold mining and extraction these days requires massive earth-moving equipment. A small recovery has been seen in some of the metals companies, after they have curbed supplies and slowed down or shuttered unprofitable operations. Lastly, Caterpillar’s earnings trends remain in decline. The issue is that analysts often lower targets and companies often give sand-bagged guidance. That makes the estimates easier to beat when the actual reporting comes around. In short, the bad numbers often do not look so bad when you compare them to estimates. If you think back to the start of the 2016, chances are high that you would not have foreseen Caterpillar as the top-performing Dow stock almost two-thirds of the way through the year. If you did expect that, it might have been because you thought the market was heading lower. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   Before getting too excited about Caterpillar’s 2016 rise to $83.00, just keep in mind that this was a $115 stock back in April of 2011. It still has a long way to go before its return to new highs. Revenues were $47 billion in 2015, versus $55 billion in 2014 and in 2013. Analysts see revenues of $40.1 billion in 2016 and $39.6 billion in 2017. Stay tuned. By Jon C.

I'm, also, anxiously awaiting. Thank you. I'm still seeking a new church that's not geared toward younger members. I'm 55 years old. I'm looking for a church that is quiet. No screaming kids during service. Sunday school class geared toward older age group. A church that offers Bible study classes. A church where the members are respectful and don't show up for Sunday service in blue jeans. Any suggestions? To the person who asked about finding fresh, luscious peaches, for the past two years I have been purchasing then at the Costco warehouse on Jefferson Avenue in Newport News, and have been very pleased with them. If you decide to purchase them there, I would suggest you get a bib, as the juice will run down your front. I've been trying to find a frozen Boston cream pie in the Williamsburg area. I checked about every major grocery store and none of them carry them. If anybody knows where I can find one, please call me at 565-2469. Thank you. Photos in Williamsburg submitted by readers. Upload your photos at community.vagazette.com, community.dailypress.com or community.tidewaterreview.com. I am looking for someone who can transfer a VHS to a DVD. I would appreciate any recommendations. Thank you. Yes, does anybody have a kitchen table and chair to donate? If you do, could you give me a call at 566-1718? Thank you. Guns I was in a local sandwich/smoothie business having lunch today. A gentleman casually dressed wearing shorts entered the shop. I noticed he had a holstered gun around his waist. My first thought was - really, is that necessary? Then I decided it was. He didn't have to worry about the servers messing up his order. Lend a hand The Salvation Army has Back to School tags available at the main entrance to Walmart on Rochambeau. A new outfit and shoes would help a child get off to a good start to the school year. Thank you for helping make that possible by taking a tag. A better name? I believe it's time to rename Route 199 to a name that everybody knows and can pronounce. I have always heard it called Route 199 and never by its name. How about "History Way" or "Colonial Capital Boulevard"? It would be really be nice to name Route 199 something we all can remember, pronounce and need. What do you think? Great evening Kudos to all those responsible for bringing Lyle Lovett and his Large Band to the Lake Matoaka Amphitheater last Wednesday evening. Mr. Lovett has a warm and gracious stage presence and goes out of his way to highlight the talents of everyone on stage with him, which included a gospel choir from Richmond as well as the dozen musicians who travel with him. It was an outstanding and enjoyable evening of first-rate music in a beautiful setting, and drew two standing ovations from the large and appreciative audience. Please bring him back! Thank you Thank you to Sentara Emergency Room and to Riverside on Kings Way for follow up work when I had an urgent health issue. Everyone was very friendly. I felt very respected as a patient and not just treated simply a number in the system. Here's to good health for everyone! On Friday Aug. 5, we had a water geyser from an old underground pipe that had to be 6 feet tall. Virginia Service Authority did a great job of replacing the pipe within 10 - 12 hours. Great going, guys! Monday they were back and redid our driveway with crush and run stone. It looks better today than when we had the house built. Now I see where our taxes go and I won't complain next time. Thank you. Kudos to Luck Stone in Toano. They were extremely helpful recently when we needed an assist. Their service was above and beyond. You never know when you're going to run into good people like that. We need more of them! I accidentally dropped my wallet as I was leaving the grocery store and when I arrived home, my phone rang. A lovely woman was on the phone and she said, "I think we found your wallet outside the grocery store." Her husband, Martin, was such a gentleman. He met me at the police station and gave me my wallet back. Thank God! It's such a pleasure to live in this town. There are wonderful people in this world. Many thanks to the lovely ladies that helped me when I fell on Wed. What a wonderful community we live in. Health insurance The person asking about his/her $2,500 from the Affordable Care Act was posing a cheeky question (also a factually inaccurate one). I received something better: the life of my nephew. He was a strapping 20-something former athlete until the day he was found unconscious and close to death. Over a period of months, specialists worked to diagnose and treat the sudden illness. Fortunately, Obamacare had prodded him to buy health insurance just months before he fell ill. Now he's well on his way to recovery without facing a lifetime of debt. IRS scams When I get the IRS scam, like I said before, I politely thank the caller and tell them that I will deal with it at the IRS office in Hampton tomorrow. Usually the response is one word and not printable. Not my sacrifice We as parents make sacrifices to raise our children. Some have one child, others have nine, and many of us are somewhere in the middle. If our adult child chooses to go into the military and subsequently dies, it was their sacrifice, not mine. To say I have sacrificed because my child died at war is taking away from my child's love and respect of their fellow soldiers and country. They gave the ultimate gift to us all. Please, let's stop stealing our adult men's and women's sacrifice...as well as all parents' sacrifices. Rio Olympics 2016 Rio Olympics: Keep it going, USA! You're doing great! And could someone answer a question for me? In the past, I never saw anything on Michael Phelps' shoulder, where there are now circles on both shoulders and multiple circles. Are they some type of tattoo? I hope somebody knows the answer. Please put it in the paper for me. Thank you. Editor's note: those circles are from cupping, a treatment to increase blood circulation to fatigues muscles. Rules of the road Why does the speed limit on 199 begin at 55 miles per hour, then change to 45 miles per hour and then change again to 60 miles per hour? Free to you I used to do a lot of sewing and have sewing thread not being used. Most spools never used...all colors. Probably 100 spools of dual duty thread. Free.....email at susanstetler39@gmail.com. The Great Clothing Giveaway will be happening on Saturday, August 20, from 10 a.m. - 2 p.m. at the Smith Memorial Baptist Church Family Life Center. This is free and open to anyone in need of clothing. We will have clothes for infants, children, teens and adult men and women. Donations are welcome! If you have clothing that is clean and gently used or new, we are taking donations at the SMBC Family Life Center Monday - Friday, August 15-19, from 9 a.m. - 2 p.m. Clothing that is left over will be donated to local shelters and outreach centers. Anyone know where I can get sewing scissors sharpened? I used to get them sharpened at Jo Ann's , but they don't have anyone at this store. Man at farmers' market only sharpens knives. Need your help. In the city of Williamsburg, free: one sofa sleeper couch, pretty green pattern, you pick up. Call 252-813-2642. Free: Clothes basket full of fabric remnants. Please call 565-1300. Get the scoreboard Before James City County does the interior demolition at James Blair High School, they should consider taking the scoreboard off from the basketball court because Jimmy Maloney donated the scoreboard many years ago. It has a Pottery rainbow on it. They should carefully take it by taking the scoreboard down and above the basketball goals and bringing them back to the Pottery because that is a collector's item. Syrian immigrants Yes, in regards to the caller in regards to Syrian immigrants: I would say when Jesus was on Earth, there was no ISIS. So, that's my comment. Thank you. A recent writer was mistaken concerning Trump's ban of Syrian refugees. Trump stated he would temporarily ban refugees from the Middle East until they can put into place a method of determining if they pose a threat to the US, an issue that even the FBI does not have a solution for at this time. When you look at the terrorist situation in Europe at this time, with the number of people being killed by terrorist activity, that does not seem to be an unreasonable stance. To the person who wrote concerning Syrian immigration: There needs to be some correction of their facts. The person implied Aramaic, the language of Jesus, was only spoken in Syria, but it is spoken throughout the area, including Turkey and other neighboring countries. It was also written that Syria was the birthplace of Christianity. I do not know how they came up with that unless Jerusalem, Nazareth and Capernaum have moved to a suburb of Damascus, Jesus never traveled beyond Judea, which is located in present day Israel, not Syria. Can't believe someone would compare Jesus Christ to the known Syrian terrorists that are responsible for murder around the world. You can't be a Christian. Foreign companies For those who like to shop U.S.-owned businesses, Martin's (Dutch), Food Lion (Belgian), A&P (German), 7-Eleven (Japan) and Aldi (German) are wholly owned by huge foreign corporations. If you shop there, your food dollars are going overseas. Smithfield (China), Purina (Switzerland), French's (England) and Nestle (Switzerland) products are also owned by foreign corporations. Veterans affairs I can't believe someone is claiming that the current administration is concerned about us veterans! Have you not read or heard on the TV about all the problems with the Veterans Administration? The Obama Administration gets a solid F from this veteran. Doctor visits To the reader who complained about being doubled billed for an office visit: Was your doctor owned by the insurance company or did they cross over to the other shore, sell their practice, and become a salesman for the hospital? For what it is worth, there are many who view insurance companies and hospitals today as nothing more than criminal organizations that front as insurance companies and hospitals. Safety in Baltimore Thank you, Justice Department, for making Baltimore the most dangerous city in the USA. Now the police will have no authority and criminals will rule the city. My family will not return to the city of Baltimore due to the dangerous environment. The so-called rights violations got real criminals off the street and in prison. Recommended We would like to commend Dr. Renee Welch at Anderson's Corner Animal Hospital for her veterinary skills and compassion in helping us to say goodbye to our beloved dog, a very difficult decision. A decision reached with the empathy and comfort of Dr. Welch and her staff. Thank you for your loving care. I just got my hair cut and styled by Mark Wilkerson at his new studio, Mark's Hair Studio on Ironbound Road. The color is magnificent. The pixie style is cute. The conversation was entertaining and I didn't have to compete over the noise to be heard, like in other larger salons. If anyone is looking for great hair care, I recommend Mark's Hair Studio 757-345-9810. Just save room for me, please. Recently we have had problems with the sump pump in our crawl space. I can't say enough about United Pest Control, with whom we also have a moisture control contract for many years. Jordan, one of the technicians, was able to locate and fix the problem quickly. He came back later to reinstall insulation on the A/C duct work that had started falling off from the extra water in the crawl space. He is efficient, courteous and a delight to work with. This senior gal enjoys her computer but has little knowledge of how it works. I recently had Quinton Blanchard load Windows 10, clean up problems and instruct me on various operational aspects. Quinton is knowledgeable, reasonable and very patient. He makes house calls. I highly recommend him for any computer problems. His email is qwblanchard@gmail.com and phone number is 757-504-6376. If you need a skilled electrician, I highly recommend Kevin O'Connell with K&K Electrical at 757-903-2565. I recently called him out to check our microwave and the electrical outlet going to it. He arrived on time, was very professional and handled our problem with ease. Very affordable, too! We will call him again with any electrical needs. My recommendation for your house cleaner is the girl I use. Her name is Kristen and she is a sweet girl who works very hard, pays attention to details, does not just clean down the middle. You can reach her at 757-903-1787. I know you will be happy with the results. I'm a very satisfied user of Paws and Claws Pet Sitting Service (757-814-6626) for over 5 years. They also pick up my mail, newspaper and put out the garbage and recycling bins! A note is left giving the highlights of their visits which I enjoy reading when I return home and my cats are very content! So, whether away for work, vacation or even once when I had an emergency stay the hospital, you can rely on their services to take care of your pets. Cemetery name? Does anybody know what's the name of the small cemetery on Rochambeau Road? Someone said it was a pet cemetery, but I'd like to know for sure. Fresh produce Can anyone tell us what has become of the wonderful farm stand that has been in the Williamsburg Shopping Center at the corner of Richmond Road and Monticello? Have they set up somewhere else? Every summer for over 30 years we have looked forward to their wonderful farm grown produce. Thank you. Direct complaints The reason to write the complaint in about a business is to have others do the same or tell the store manager, as I also did. The more complaints, the better the chance for a change. Maybe you might want to take back your statement. Presidential politics It's increasing obvious that Trump has never read the Constitution or he is a compulsive liar. His statement that Hillary would abolish the 2nd Amendment is evidence of both. Clinton has called for universal background checks, which is supported by a majority of NRA members. An amendment cannot not be abolished. Thirty-three states would have to vote to ratify to remove or add an amendment. Time for a history lesson for all my Republican friends: Ford pardoned Nixon. Reagan sold arms to Iran and funded a secret war that Congress knew nothing about and then lied to the American people about it. George Bush Sr. told us "no new taxes," and then we know what happened. His son lied about Iraq's role in 9/11, and led us into the costliest war in U.S. history. Cheney outed a covert CIA agent as political payback. And Hillary, in your opinion, is the worst of the worst for using a private server? Time for a little perspective, I think. Yes, I would encourage everybody in the community to go see the movie, "Hillary's America." Very informative. For one who would like to know about our candidates, I think this would be a good movie to see. Have a good day. Recently a Last Word reader suggested we all stop submitting comments about the presidential campaign. Good idea, and I would like to stop that, too. But, we continue to have readers submit nasty and outright wrong comments that can only have come from biased sources like Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter and their cohorts. Readers like me, who get news from many sources -- liberal and conservative -- know much of their stuff is wrong, and simply can't resist setting the record straight. I propose that people stop using Last Word to spread this right-wing blather. Then, I'll bet other folks like me will stop our comments as well. The first time the American government experimented with trickle-down economics, aka supply- side economics, the Reagan Administration jumped the national debt 468%, from $880 billion dollars to $5 trillion in eight years. Now we have a candidate who is proposing doing it again. We can't afford that. With the Russian hack of the DNC, the specter of their hacking electronic voting machines and throwing the election in the favor of their favored candidate, there is a cheap and easy solution which cannot be hacked. Paper ballots and number 2 pencils. And, there is no chance of "hanging chads" and other irregularities. With apologies to the Bard: Drop out, Drop out brief Trump! You are but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and is heard no more. Yours is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Dan Rather was quick to state that Trump's comment on those who believe in the Second Amendment would resort to violence if Hillary was to be elected President. Where was Dan Rather when Black Lives Matter condoned violence against law enforcement? I expected nothing less from the liberal biased news. Every time Trump gives a speech in public, the Democrats place hecklers in the audience. This is obviously well planned, as those hecklers do so in a spaced out manner. I think it's about time that the Republicans do the same. I would also suggest, in response to protests from Black Lives Matter, that all off duty law enforcement officers protest at Democratic events. Trump can't get a break. Last week he was hoping the economy would tank fast. Too bad for him the stock market hit new highs, the Obama economy created nearly 600,000 new jobs in two months and the unemployment rate is at 4.9 %. What kind of sick person would root for his fellow Americans to lose their job so they can find you another one?

 JD.com had a strong quarter — but it still faces one major problem BI Intelligence Aug. 13, 2016, 3:30 AM 1,146 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Digital is mitigating in-store losses at Target Google's latest acquisition should boost Google Shopping Amazon opens Prime shipping to all merchants This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "E-Commerce Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. JD.com reported strong a Q2 2016 earnings performance, but the company's growth rates have been consistently decelerating since 2014. The e-commerce company's gross merchandise volume (GMV) is still dwarfed by that of competitor Alibaba. However, new efforts in fulfillment, coupled with its acquisition of Yihaodian, could help JD.com gain some ground. Total revenue for JD.com during Q2 2016 grew 42% YoY to reach nearly $10 billion. GMV totaled $24 billion, marking 47% YoY growth. Active customers reached 188 million, growing 65% YoY. Excluding virtual items, JD.com fulfilled over 373 million orders during Q2, 56% more than in the comparable 2015 quarter. Moving forward, a heavy focus will be placed on JD.com's grocery sales, which can be improved by leveraging its drone delivery. Yihaodian — which JD.com acquired from Walmart — is a strong performer in the grocery e-commerce market. In addition to this acquisition, the company plans to continually add new products to its grocery and consumer packaged goods (CPG) categories, reports CEO Haoyu Shen. This poses a challenge for JD.com, as transferring perishables costs more and can lead to damaged goods. To combat such issues, JD.com may combine its efforts in grocery with its drone delivery program. The program allows JD.com to reach consumers more quickly, while also providing access to consumers in rural villages that traditional delivery trucks cannot navigate. By utilizing drone delivery, while leveraging Yihaodian's existing inventory, JD.com may be able to glean a significant advantage in China's grocery e-commerce market. Competitor Alibaba recently invested in its own online grocery startup, but it pales in comparison to Yihaodian's existing user base and brand recognition.

It’s hard to not be impressed lately by Amazon.com. Shares are up 14% year-to-date, more than the broader market, and up about 60% from the lows of around $480 in February. Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 778.56 -6.77 -0.86% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 70.74 +0.62 +0.88% Costco Wholesale Corp COST ▼ 152.08 -0.60 -0.39% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▼ 60.30 -0.82 -1.34% And of course, Amazon was one of the top performers in the S&P 500 last year with a return of roughly 120%. For those waiting for this pick to cool off, that February dip was just about the only opportunity in almost two years of seemingly constant appreciation as the stock continues to set new all-time highs. The bears have the same old argument about Amazon’s forward price-to-earnings ratio being too high (it’s still north of 70), as well as some new ones now that the growth rate in the much-vaunted Amazon Web Services division is starting to cool. However Amazon on balance remains one of the best investments on Wall Street right now. Here are seven reasons why: 1. Serious profits: Amazon’s second-quarter numbers, out a few weeks back, were mighty impressive. Earnings of $1.78 per share showed it can indeed make a nice profit for shareholders, and as MarketWatch Tech Editor Jeremy Owens pointed out on the day of the report, second-quarter net income was “up more than 900% (!) from the same quarter a year ago, and more than 50% higher than analyst estimates.” This comes after a smash first-quarter report that also showed robust profitability, with net income of $1.07 per share that almost doubled Wall Street forecasts. 2. AWS power: A big reason for those profits is, of course, cloud-computing arm Amazon Web Services. This fast-growing division gets a lot of press for its revenue expansion, up 58% in the second quarter and running at about $10 billion over the past four quarters. However, the real appeal for investors should be the profit potential. Last quarter, AWS posted higher net income than the company’s entire e-commerce segment. Yes, the growth rate of this cloud-computing business has cooled off, but name another $10 billion business growing at this clip. Furthermore, AWS clearly is the dominant player in the space; a recent Goldman Sachs report puts AMZN cloud revenue at five times that of Microsoft Corp. and an amazing 15 times that of Alphabet Inc.   3. Everyone’s upgrading: After the strong performance of Amazon lately, it has been one big upgrade after another on Wall Street. MKM recently reiterated its buy rating and upped its target to $995 — about 30% higher from here. And in the wake of earnings, other firms from Wedbush to Goldman Sachs have all upgraded Amazon stock with a target north of $900 a share. 4. Primed With Prime: Wholesale club Costco Wholesale Corp. reported in its annual filing for 2015 that it has about 81.3 million members. Consider that Consumer Intelligence Research Partners recently estimated that Prime is hot on Costco’s heels with 69 million members — which, at $99 annually, adds up to more than $6.8 billion in baseline revenue for the tech company. Not only is this a great stream of cash, but it is also a pipeline of customers who can continue to support the Amazon ecosystem. 5. Don’t sweat Jet: Wal-Mart Stores Inc. just acquired e-commerce company Jet.com for $3.3 billion in a clear shot across Amazon’s bow. However, Amazon investors hardly have to worry anytime soon. According to the a recent eMarketer report, Amazon commands over $79 billion, or 74% of the total U.S. e-commerce market, while Wal-Mart does just $13 billion in sales, or slightly under 3%. The Jet buyout may juice that and provide some much-needed digital know-how at Wal-Mart, but it has a whole lot of ground to make up. 6. Kindle on fire: While CEO Jeff Bezos has admitted that the Kindle line of devices is sold at cost, investors shouldn’t discount the growing hardware might of Amazon. Research firm IDC pegged the Fire tablet as No. 3 in the world after a strong holiday quarter that saw a half-million of the devices shipped. Since then, however, sales have been even more impressive as Amazon saw over 5,400% year-over- year growth in first-quarter unit sales to tally 2.2 million Kindles sold, by IDC’s count … then a 1,200% year-over-year improvement in the second quarter to move 1.6 million units in those three months! Yes, the tablets don’t do much for Amazon’s financials right now. But the more people Amazon hooks on its hardware and ecosystem, the more potential it has for follow-on sales of content down the road. 7. What’s next? Lost in all the fireworks about profitability, Prime and Amazon Web Services may be the most bullish argument of all for Amazon — that the company is still growing aggressively. In the company’s second-quarter earnings release, Bezos pointed out a big push into India, “where we launched a new AWS Region, introduced Prime with unlimited free shipping, and announced that Prime Video is coming soon, offering Prime members in India exclusive access to Amazon Original Series and Movies.” More recently, maybe you’ve heard of Prime Air and Amazon’s aims to operate a fleet of cargo planes. This kind of vision and expansion means investors certainly haven’t see the last of what this disruptive tech company has to offer.

CNN Money2:31 UP NEXT Bulls could keep the market rally going until the last of the kids go back to school — and the bears return from vacation. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 70.74 +0.62 +0.88% U.S. Dividend Growers Income Corp. US ▲ 8.96 +0.03 +0.34% Cisco Systems Inc CSCO ▼ 29.68 -0.21 -0.70% The Home Depot Inc HD ▲ 131.18 +0.20 +0.15% Stocks broke out to new highs this past week in the three key indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 (.SPX) and Nasdaq — for the first time since 1999. That was seen as a positive, pointing to further gains if oil and other market concerns don't get in the way. "We're encouraged by the fact that all these indices made highs, but at the same time we think investors are way too complacent about the risks out there right now. Last August, our summer was cut short by two weeks because of China [currency devaluation]. This time, the volatility came meaningfully before the fourth of July, so I think people aggressively seized this vacation season," said Julian Emanuel, equity and derivatives strategist at UBS. "The true threat coming this fall is the political uncertainty." Emanuel said for that reason, stocks could continue to edge higher if August remains quiet. Oil has taken some of the pressure off of stocks, rallying after OPEC signaled it could talk about taking some action to steady the market if necessary when it meets in late September. In the week ahead, retailers dominate the earnings calendar with reports from Wal-Mart, Target, Gap, Urban Outfitters and Home Depot. There is CPI inflation data Tuesday and the minutes from the Fed's last meeting Wednesday. Stocks shrugged off surprisingly flat retail sales data Friday, after a strong showing in June, but Treasury yields fell with traders betting the Fed will be less likely to raise rates this year if the economy weakens. The 10-year (US10Y) was yielding 1.51 percent late Friday. The Nasdaq comp and the Nasdaq 100 ended the week at all-time highs. The Nasdaq comp gained 0.2 percent for the week to 5,232. The S&P 500 was at 2,184, up less than a tenth for the week and 4 points away from its all-time high. The Dow was up 0.2 percent for the week at 18,576. Market volume was light, one of the three lightest weeks of the year. Meanwhile, the VIX (.VIX), the CBOE's volatility index, was at an extremely low 11.55 Friday, trading in a range last seen a year ago. The VIX represents the trading of puts and calls in the S&P 500. "When we look at VIX under 12, and out-of-the-money call options being priced historically high, reflecting this increased risk of missing out on a rally — after we already had a rally — we think people are being too complacent about risk," said Emanuel. "We're neither calling for a sell-off or an end to the 7-1/2 year bull market. We just think you have to step back and remember that this is a higher volatility environment." Emanuel said the rest of August could be a "blase drift" where investors are rotating into more cyclical stocks, like technology. But he said the market volatility could quickly return after Labor Day, and history shows that the market action picks up right away in September, often a weak month for stocks. This September there is an important Fed meeting, though the Fed is not widely expected to raise rates then. Analysts also believe markets may begin to focus on the U.S. presidential election after the summer. "The kids don't want to come home from the beach, why should the adults? You come home from the beach and the pricing of the risks are low. The risks themselves have not changed, but summertime complacency has driven the price of risk to near cycle lows. That's in an environment where the risks themselves have only marginally diminished over the last several months and are likely to intensify again as we get closer to the election," said Emanuel. Analysts are still looking for small caps to catch up to the other indexes and hit new highs. The Russell 2000 is about 5 percent below its all-time high. The last time the three indexes reached new highs together was at the end of the tech bubble, and a year later the Nasdaq was down 39 percent. But there had been 131 instances where all three hit highs between 1986 and 1999, and the market moved ahead afterward. "This is not the characteristic of a major top in the market," said Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer. "After two years of very little movement, and we haven't been in a very wide trading range, we think the bull is getting started again." Wald said his year-end target on the S&P is 2,250. "We think we're going higher. We want to own stocks," he said. "If you look at the differences between now and where we were last year, ahead of that volatility we had in August, and even in the beginning of the year, the internal breadth is much better, credit conditions are much better than they were, and commodities prices have stabilized. They were in freefall last year. That's the setup equities like."

CNN Money2:31 UP NEXT Deep-fried Twinkies are no longer just for state fairs and those with deep fryers at home.  Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 70.74 +0.62 +0.88% Hostess Brands, the makers of Twinkies and a slew of other packaged treats, is launching Deep Fried Twinkies on Friday, AP reports. The new Twinkies can be found in the frozen food section at Walmart for the next three months, and after that will be available at other stores, according to AP.  Ellen Copaken, Hostess vice president of marketing, told AP the treats were inspired by consumers who have been deep frying Twinkies at home and at fairs for years.  “We’ve seen the rise in popularity of deep fried Twinkies on dessert menus across the country as well,” Copaken told AP.  But while a deep-fried Twinkie may taste great, it’s not exactly a healthy snack. Coming in at 9 grams of fat and 220 calories, Deep Fried Twinkies have double the fat content of a regular Twinkie. © Mary Altaffer, AP In this Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2016, photo, Associated Press reporter Anne D'Innocenzio arranges frozen, deep-fried Twinkies on a tray before baking in New York. The treats, which come in chocolate and vanilla, are in with line the "caloric decadence," the brand is known for, but may be a turnoff for moms purchasing treats for their children, according to Eric Schiffer a brand expert and  Chairman and CEO of The Patriarch Organization, DigitalMarketing.com, and ReputationManagementConsultants.com. He notes that consumers are more interested in healthy and natural options than ever before, and fast-food chains and makers of sugary treats like Twinkies, have tried to renew interest in their products with wacky combinations and over-the-top options, like Deep Fried Twinkies.  "It's a problem not just for Hostess, but other brands -- the trend is going to plant-based foods," Schiffer said. "This is the last fight of the Stone Age, the survivors that are trying to hang on."  The product marks the first time Hostess Brands has developed a product for the frozen foods section; a move that Schiffer said is a smart extension of the brand into another section of the grocery store.  "They’ll find as many ways as they can monetize their brand," he said. "As long as the product is consistent with the brand, it can be frozen."  On social media, the reaction to the new treats was mixed.

For those still interested, there is a similar value Xbox One S deal available with extra free controller and one year's worth of Xbox Live Gold.   Gamers interested in the Xbox One S who didn't hop bandwagon when it first released earlier this month can get a better deal now with some extra incentives. Retailers are aiming to move the recently released 2TB Launch Edition ahead the upcoming and cheaper 500GB and 1TB models later this month. Newegg is the main culprit, with their eBay shop offering an Xbox One S 2TB Launch Edition with four free games as an added bonus for $399.99.     Given the 2TB Launch Edition is at list price everywhere else, this Newegg deal is significantly better than simply picking up a unit at Walmart or Best Buy - after all, the bundle comes with four free additional Xbox One titles vs. none for the same price.   The freebies games are:    Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain Dishonored: Definitive Edition Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege Tom Clancy's The Division   Except for Dishonored, all titles are recent release within a year's timeframe.   There are additional perks if you opt to pick up this Xbox One S deal versus the local store. The big draw being sales tax savings, provided you don't reside in California, Indiana, New Jersey, or Tennessee. Newegg has warehouses in each of these locations, so you'll generally receive the console fairly quickly and within about 3 business days (with free shipping of course). The last added perk is an $8 in eBay bucks reward that you'll earn good towards anything on eBay.   Should you expect more Xbox One S deals in the coming months? We think so. At launch, we spotted two deals available (also on eBay), one of which was from Newegg offering three free games in lieu of the current four. Another deal is a simple $25 gift card as an extra bonus. Unsurprisingly, the three free game deal sold out much faster.   This current deal is selling at a decent pace, with more than 49% sold at the time of writing. While we don't think Xbox gamers will see any straight up discount anytime soon on the Xbox One S, more variety of bonuses/bundles will be offered - particularly when the 500GB and 1TB Xbox One S bundles arrive at the end of this month. If you're not in a hurry to pick up the new Xbox One S, waiting a few more weeks certainly won't be a bad idea. If however you're about to head out to the nearby GameStop - you may as well pick up this deal, snag four free games, and potentially save on sales tax.

From staff and wire reports PNC to shutter five branches PNC Financial Services Group will close five branch banks in the region Oct. 21. The affected branches include one in Pittsburgh on Brookline Boulevard, Brookline; three in Washington County: Main Street, Burgettstown; Wood Street, California; and Dunnings Highway, Claysburg; and one in Westmoreland County: Lincoln Heights branch, Lowery Avenue, Jeannette. Customers of the branches were notified last month. PNC said it is shuttering branches as more customers use digital devices for banking. Local shops arrive at Pittsburgh International Airport Some local favorites have arrived at Pittsburgh International Airport. With the latest addition to the airport's Airmall, travelers are able to sample offerings from the city's popular Strip District as well as other regional stalwarts. Among the venues featured in The Strip Market are Pennsylvania Macaroni, Enrico Biscotti, Sarris Candy, Mac's Donuts, Nicholas Coffee, and Snyder of Berlin. Other vendors include Anthony's Original Produce, The Bagel Factory, Janoski Farms and Soergel Orchards. "Bringing more of Pittsburgh into the airport is important and travelers will have a great opportunity to experience that with this market," airport spokesman Bob Kerlik said. The market, which has opened in the airport's boarding terminal, offers grab-and-go items as well as popular treats from the local vendors. Hostess launches "Deep Fried Twinkies" as first frozen treat Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, is launching packaged “Deep Fried Twinkies” starting Friday that mark its first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They’ll cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart. J.C. Penney reports sales increase, says it has contract to sell corporate campus J.C. Penney, in reporting its second-quarter financial results, said it had narrowed its loss and posted a 2.2 percent increase in same-store sales. Revenue fell slightly short of expectations. Customer traffic was up in July, and the company is confident it can continue to grow sales, Penney this summer has been opening kitchen and laundry appliance departments in its stores and testing partnerships with Ashley Furniture and flooring company Empire Today. About 200 stores now have the appliance departments. About 500 stores will have them before the end of the year. The national retailer has a contract to sell its 2 million-square-foot corporate campus outside Dallas but provided no further details on the deal. Coal lawsuit involving WV gubernatorial candidate delayed A federal judge in Delaware has indefinitely postponed a scheduled September trial in a lawsuit pitting billionaire coal magnate and West Virginia Democratic gubernatorial nominee James Justice Jr. against a leading U.S. coal exporter. Attorneys for the Virginia-based Justice companies and Pennsylvania-based Xcoal Energy and Resources told the judge Friday that floods that hit West Virginia in June, prompting Mr. Justice to open his Greenbrier Resort to victims, affected document production in the case and delayed completion of depositions. They also noted Xcoal owner Ernie Thrasher recently became ill and has not been deposed. The dispute involves a 2011 deal in which Xcoal agreed to buy almost 4 million tons of coal for $560 million. Each side claims the other has failed to live up to its obligations. U.S. business inventories rose modestly in June; sales climbed U.S. businesses increased their inventories modestly in June, as retailers continued to stock up. But factories reduced stockpiles for the 12th straight month. The Commerce Department said overall business inventories rose 0.2 percent in June, same as in May. Business sales shot up 1.2 percent in June, biggest jump since February 2013.

Advisor Insights Newsletters Site Log In Advisor Insights Log In Fed Minutes, Post-Brexit Data Highlight the Week Ahead (WMT, HD) By Aaron Hankin | Updated August 14, 2016 — 7:07 PM EDT U.S. equity markets once again had a stellar week — and even made a little history. On Thursday, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq all closed at record highs, which hasn't happened since December 1999. Friday, markets gave up some gains but still finished in positive territory for the week. As for oil, after a torrid start, it finished the week on a high note, rallying on Thursday and Friday to end up 10%. It's a busy week ahead on the U.S. data calendar, highlighted by the Fed minutes and the U.S. inflation report. Wednesday's Fed minutes will shed light on comments made that the "near term risks to the economic outlook have diminished." As the labor market continues to strengthen, some pundits see the slack in the market becoming a problem. Investors will be looking for any comments on this. After a weak U.S. PPI report, the Fed will be watching closely Tuesday's inflation report for any signs of an uptick. After the poor PPI report and disappointing retail sales any downside CPI number will likely see rate hike expectations scale back. (See also: U.S. Retail Sales Missed Expectations for July.) The earnings calendar is winding down, but some large U.S. retailers report this coming week with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) being the biggest: -Monday: Sysco (SYY). -Tuesday: Dicks Sporting Goods (DKS) and Home Depot (HD). -Wednesday: Cisco Systems (CSCO), Lowe's (LOW), Staples (SPLS) and Target (TGT). -Thursday: Wal-Mart. -Friday: Footlocker (FL). Abroad, it's a big week in the U.K. where markets will get a good look at the Brexit effect on the economy. On Tuesday, July CPI is expected to rise 0.5%, as the result of the falling British pound takes effect. The following day the U.K. employment report is released, which will give an indication if firms began to lay off workers in anticipation for a slowdown post-Brexit. The market is expecting unemployment to tick up to 5% and for average hourly wage growth to slow to 1.8% from 2.3% the prior month. The U.K. economic calendar is rounded off on Thursday where retail sales are expected to have declined by 0.9% in July as consumers halted spending amid the Brexit uncertainty. Elsewhere, Japanese GDP on Monday is expected to have fallen in the second quarter after the 0.5% increase in the first quarter. Japan continues its battle with a slowing economy and benign inflation, which has led to extreme monetary policy measures. (See also: Japan Announces 28 Trillion Yen Stimulus Package.) The week will also see employment reports from Australia and France, as well as Canadian CPI.

Photo: Marc-André Julien/Unsplash If you’re thinking of buying a new iPhone right now, don’t do it! You could save yourself a small fortune by delaying that purchase until September, when Apple is set to unveil the next models of its world-conquering smartphones. Saying that any new device gets cheaper the longer you wait to buy it may sound like stating the obvious, but we’ve been digging into our research. We’ll tell you when and how far iPhone prices will likely fall after the iPhone 7 launch so you can get an idea of whether it’s really worth waiting. The iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus will almost certainly be unveiled in early September. The rumor mill has been grinding for months already, suggesting the new iPhones might be water-resistant, have Touch ID built into the screen, feature an updated Home button, and come without a headphone jack. There’s little doubt they’ll sport improved cameras and faster performance, but it’s best to take the rest of the rumors with a healthy pinch of salt. You always pay a premium to get the latest tech. But whatever Apple unveils this fall, last year’s iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are still going to be great smartphones, and we’re expecting to see a healthy discount for both. After the Apple announcement, it’s cheaper to buy last year’s iPhones When Apple unveils a new iPhone, it generally drops the prices of the earlier models by $100. It has a tiered pricing system, so the latest phone is $649 to buy outright or $199 on a two-year contract, and you can buy last year’s iPhone for a one-time payment of $549 or $99 on contract. The iPhone Plus models work exactly the same way, but start at $749 to buy outright and $299 on a two-year contract. If you want to buy a new iPhone 6s or 6s Plus, whether you buy on contract or pay the full price up front, it will be $100 cheaper as soon as the next iPhone is announced. T-Mobile has disrupted the standard two-year contract model by offering any iPhone model without any money down — by simply splitting the cost of the handset across 24 months. So, you’ll pay a higher monthly fee, but it will cover service and the iPhone’s price tag. The other carriers have followed suit, but be careful to calculate the full price you’ll pay on any deal before you pull the trigger. Older iPhones are cheaper still In the past, Apple has also dropped an extra $100 off the next model down, so when the iPhone 6s was announced, the iPhone 5s was made available for no upfront fee and monthly installments totaling $450. However, the release of the iPhone SE has muddied the waters a little here. It effectively replaced the iPhone 5s and is being offered for a one-time payment of $399, or for nothing up front with an installment plan. We don’t expect to see any further price drops on the iPhone SE. The question is whether the iPhone 6 will drop to $449 and be made available for nothing up front with installments, which is a definite possibility. Retailers and carriers offer deeper discounts Retailers and carriers sometimes offer aggressive discounts to try and draw in customers, but iPhones tend to hold their value very well, so you have to watch out for such deals. Discounts of more than $10 or so are pretty rare in the first six months; however, we saw $90 knocked off the price of the 16GB iPhone 6s at Boost Mobile and $50 off the 64GB model from eBay sellers in February, five months after release. It was a similar story with the iPhone 6, which dropped about $40 after seven months and then fell by as much as $150 in September 2015, when the iPhone 6s was unveiled. In February of this year — 17 months after release — the iPhone 6 dropped to $380 at Boost Mobile, and by May this year it was $399 at Walmart. Plus-size deals are harder to find The iPhone 6 Plus was Apple’s first larger smartphone, and it took a long while before we saw any discounting on that model. It was eight months before we saw an eBay seller offering a $90 discount, but it dropped by over $200 after around 19 months. And by May this year, it was $499 at Walmart. We haven’t seen any discounts of note for the iPhone 6s Plus yet. Some eBay vendors have dropped $50 and $150 off the price of the higher-capacity 64GB and 128GB models respectively, but that’s it so far. (The 128GB 6s Plus still costs a whopping $800 even at $150 off.) These discounts might be slightly bested when the iPhone 7 debuts, but we probably won’t see much deeper discounts than that for quite some time. Carriers entice consumers with ‘buy one, get one free’ deals One eye-catching iPhone 6s deal that was available just three months after release was AT&T‘s “buy one, get one free” offer. It wasn’t advertised for the iPhone 6s, though that model was eligible. You had to add a second line and commit to 30 months, but it was possible to claim bill credits for the full price back after three months. (This deal is no longer available at AT&T.) Sprint is still offering a deal like this on the iPhone 6s or the iPhone 6s Plus, if you’re willing to sign up for a second line with the carrier. Deals on the iPhone 7 If you’re already an iPhone owner, then you’ll find some attractive deals on the new iPhone if you’re willing to trade in your old handset. It’s also worth seeing what you can get in the secondhand market, because iPhones hold their value better than any other smartphone. You will generally make more by selling your iPhone directly than you will for trading it in, and you can put that extra money toward the new one. It’s likely to be at least six months before we see any significant discounting on the new iPhone 7 or 7 Plus. But if you and your partner both want a new iPhone, then it’s worth watching out for “buy one, get one free” offers. Readers, do you opt for the newest iPhone or buy discounted older models?

Imperial Valley News Heart of the Matter American Red Cross Sheltering Thousands in Louisiana After Unprecedented Flooding Print Email Details Written by Imperial Valley News Category: National News Published: 14 August 2016 Washington, DC - The American Red Cross is helping at least 4,700 people in dozens of emergency shelters in Louisiana after unprecedented flooding has left 15 rivers in record flood stage. “This is an extremely chaotic situation right now, with life-threatening flood waters, power outages and road closures complicating relief efforts – as many local volunteers have also been directly affected by the flooding,” said Brad Kieserman, vice president, Disaster Services Operations and Logistics for the Red Cross. “This is by far our largest sheltering effort in Louisiana since Hurricane Isaac, and the bulk of this staggering devastation is in areas that typically don’t experience flooding. The Red Cross is mobilizing a massive relief effort which could be our largest since Hurricane Sandy.” Thousands of people have been forced from their homes with little but the clothes on their backs. Red Cross disaster volunteers are opening shelters, providing meals and comfort. Additional volunteers, relief supplies and emergency response vehicles are moving toward Louisiana now to bolster response efforts. “Our work is just beginning, and we will be on the ground for weeks helping people in Louisiana pick up the pieces,” continued Kieserman. “Entire families have lost their homes and everything they own, please join the Red Cross in supporting Louisiana by making a much needed financial donation today.” Flooding is expected to continue for several days, and once waters recede it will take some time to fully uncover the extent of the devastation. The Red Cross will be working closely partners in the days ahead to ensure people receive the help they need as quickly as possible. Flooding is also threatening communities in Mississippi, where Red Cross volunteers provided safe refuge to nearly 70 people Saturday night. HOW TO HELP To help people affected by the Louisiana Floods, visit redcross.org, call 1-800-RED CROSS or text the word LAFLOODS to 90999 to make a $10 donation. Donations enable the Red Cross to prepare for, respond to and help people recovery from these disasters. FLOODING SAFETY INFORMATION The Red Cross has steps people should follow to remain safe: 1. Be prepared to evacuate at a moment’s notice and heed evacuation orders when given. When a flood or flash flood warning is issued for your area, head for higher ground and stay there. 2. Stay away from floodwaters. 3. If you come upon a flooded road while driving, turn around and go another way. If you are caught on a flooded road and waters are rising rapidly around you, get out of the car quickly and move to higher ground. Most cars can be swept away by less than two feet of moving water. 4. Keep children out of the water. 5. Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize flood dangers. DOWNLOAD EMERGENCY APP Download the free Red Cross Emergency App to receive emergency alerts and information about what to do in case of flooding and other disasters, as well as locations of shelters. The App also includes emergency first aid information and a Family Safe feature which allows people to instantly see if loved ones are okay.

Joyce M. Rosenberg, AP Business Writer Leave a comment 60 reads In this Tuesday, Aug. 2, 2016, photo, Terina McKinney works with Malian mud cloth for her fashion accessories and home decor items in Camden, N.J. (AP Photo/Mel Evans) NEW YORK (AP) _ When Terina McKinney displays her leather bags and belts at events attended primarily by Black women, they are often interested in her designs, and in her experience as an African-American business owner. But she seldom makes sales. “They all ooh and ahh and ask a ton of questions, but don’t necessarily make purchases,” says McKinney, whose Jypsea Leathergoods products range from $20 to $325. Instead, her customers tend to be White or Asian women. While calls have been increasing for Black consumers to support Black-owned businesses with their buying power estimated at more than $1.2 trillion a year, social media campaigns with momentum like (hash)buyblack are relatively new. And McKinney’s frustration is shared by some other Black business owners who say they can find it hard to sell to Black consumers. The factors can be logistical or practical, such as being located farther away or having higher prices than big chain stories, retail experts and civic leaders say. Scarcity can be a reason: It can be hard to find businesses owned by African-Americans. But other considerations might be emotional, like wanting a trendy design everyone is wearing, or the perception that national brands are better. “There’s a myth that’s been placed on our communities for many generations: White people’s ice is colder. White businesses are superior to Black businesses,” says Ron Busby, president of the U.S. Black Chambers, a national business organization for Black-owned companies. “We have to change that mentality. We have to be better, conscientious consumers.” In this Tuesday, Aug. 2, 2016, photo, Terina McKinney works with Malian mud cloth for her fashion accessories and home decor items in Camden, N.J. When McKinney displays her works at luncheons and other events, Black women are interested in her designs, and in her experience as an African-American business owner. But they don’t necessarily make purchases. (AP Photo/Mel Evans) McKinney, who lives in Camden, New Jersey, outside of Philadelphia, says her lower sales to Black shoppers don’t seem to be a matter of money, since she finds that many will spend on well-known labels. Designer Joede Brown has seen similar responses to her crocheted clothing, which sells under the Black Pearl Creations brand from under $30 to up to $500 for the most intricate pieces. She finds Black customers sometimes say her products are too expensive, although they’ll wear a big-name brand that costs the same or more. Brown, who lives in Manchester, New Hampshire, recognizes that a preference for well-known brands isn’t limited to the Black community, but also wonders if buying them is a statement: “You’ve beaten me down, but look, I can have this too.” Consumers who do try to focus their spending on black-owned companies say finding them requires research, and it can take more time and effort to get there. But locating options is getting far easier, both through local and national social media campaigns and online lists from groups like the U.S. Black Chambers. “This is the only way we as a people can generate wealth, by supporting our own,” says Rebecca Briscoe, of Houston. Her grandfather’s photography company was Black-owned and focused on Black customers from the 1940s onward because White photographers would not do business with them. “If you don’t support their business, they don’t have a business,” says Briscoe. Campaigns like (hash)buyblack and also (hash)bankblack, which encourages people to use Black-owned financial institutions, are having an impact. The (hash)bankblack campaign got a boost last month from rapper and activist Killer Mike, who called on people to shift their money to these banks. OneUnited Bank has gone from 50 new accounts a day to as many as 1,000, says Teri Williams, president of the financial institution that has offices in Boston, Miami and Los Angeles and also operates online. “It’s opening the community’s eyes to the many ways they’re spending their dollars,” Williams says of the campaigns. Businesses that provide a service may have more success than those that sell merchandise, says Jerome Williams, a marketing professor at Rutgers University. “Since service businesses tend to involve more people interactions, the people relationships should prove to be more important, compared to situations where the focus is primarily on the product,” he says. Small and medium-sized retailers can find it hard to compete on price and selection with giants such as Wal-Mart that can negotiate lower prices with manufacturers through their scale. And finding Black retailers and service providers across a range of industries isn’t always easy, Jerome Williams says. “As a Black consumer, if I wanted to buy from a Black-owned merchant, there aren’t enough to satisfy my needs,” he says. The nearly 2.6 million Black-owned companies in the United States account for about 9 percent of the total number of businesses in a country where 13 percent of the population is Black. The 2012 census of businesses found that Black-owned operations made up about 6 percent of all U.S. retailers and about 7 percent of businesses that provide food or accommodation. Financial counselor Harrine Freeman has Black-owned beauty supply and clothing stores, a dollar store, shoe repair and other service providers not too far from her Washington, D.C., home. She has searched online or asked friends and neighbors to find other businesses. But other Black-owned stores might be an hour’s drive away. “I’m willing to drive that far, but that’s not to say I can go there every week,” Freeman says. Many stores in traditionally Black neighborhoods may also have changed hands. In parts of Los Angeles, including the once-majority Black South Central area, Hispanics have replaced many of the Black residents, and many Black-owned businesses have closed or moved, says Joe Hicks, vice president of Community Advocates Inc. in Los Angeles. Black-owned businesses offer Black consumers distinct advantages _ especially if shoppers have felt discriminated against at other places _ and can provide services tailored to their needs, says Geraldine Henderson, a marketing professor at Loyola University in Chicago. She cited health care providers who understand medical concerns that may be more relevant to Black patients. “You want to go to a provider with cultural competence,” Henderson says. Maggie Anderson, who lives in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, wrote a book called “Our Black Year” about her effort to buy from Black-owned businesses exclusively. That included the stores where she and her husband bought food, clothing, household necessities and personal care items, as well as service providers like hair salons, auto mechanics and restaurants. Sometimes that meant driving 50 miles to get things. Sometimes it meant going without fresh fruit because they couldn’t find what they wanted at a Black-owned store. It meant telling their daughters “no” when a toy or book wasn’t sold at a Black-owned shop. “It was a message to our fellow Black consumers that we have to be more accountable to what has happened to and what is happening to our community,” Anderson says. Anderson says she has sensed some wariness when she speaks with groups of Black consumers about her project, because the audience understands the amount of work involved. She says she also knows that while she had the time and financial resources to devote to the endeavor, people with lower incomes, little spare time and lacking the means to travel might have difficulty doing the same. “It is not that that Black consumers will not shop with Black stores, products or services,” says Hicks. “Most American consumers are looking for the best buy, the most convenient, best quality within a relatively short distance from where they live.” ___ Follow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

Beavercreek police officer Sean Williams and Sgt. David Darkow may have to submit to depositions in the John Crawford III wrongful death lawsuit before a U.S. Dept. of Justice investigation is over, a federal magistrate ruled. In approving a further stay of discovery until further order of the court, U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge Michael Newman also ordered attorneys to set a new case calendar. RELATED: Officer who shot Crawford used force 10 times more than departmental average “The undersigned acknowledges the significant interests of Plaintiffs and the public in moving this case to conclusion, as well as the potential prejudice that may occur to Plaintiffs should the stay in this civil case continue over the next several months,” Newman wrote in an Aug. 10 docket entry. Newman ordered the parties to discuss “an agreeable date upon which the limited stay shall cease in the event the Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation continues without conclusion over the next several months,” he wrote, “The parties shall also discuss the feasibility of limited depositions of Defendants Williams and Darkow in the meantime.” On Aug. 5, 2014 at Beavercreek’s Walmart, Williams shot Crawford, a 22-year-old Fairfield native, after a lone 911 caller said a black man was waving a rifle at people including children. Beavercreek police said Williams and Darkow twice told Crawford to drop the item — an air rifle he picked up from an open box in the store — and then Williams fired twice “center mass” as he told investigators. His family said Crawford — who was talking on his cell phone — had less than a second to react to any commands. A Greene County special grand jury led by special prosecutor Mark Piepmeier in September 2014 did not indict Williams, who remains on administrative duty as decided by Beavercreek police Chief Dennis Evers. The no true bill in the criminal case led the DOJ to announce a full investigation of the probe done by Ohio’s Bureau of Criminal Investigation. Outside of an April statement by acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio Benjamin Glassman saying that the probe “has taken longer than some may have anticipated,” no federal officials have commented on investigation that turns two years old Sept. 24. Attorneys for Crawford’s parents filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Beaverceek and Walmart in December 2014 and sent a letter to U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch asking that the DOJ decision be announced no later than Aug. 31.

That was the difference in local voters having the opportunity to decide whether to allow alcohol sales in Johnson County for the first time in 80 years. The Johnson County Clerk's Office accepted 5,441 petition signatures last week to place a wet/dry measure on the Nov. 8 general election ballot. The local organization Keep Our Dollars in Johnson County turned in 10,342 signatures for review. Michelle Frost's office rejected 4,901 signatures, leaving 5,441 accepted signatures. State law required that valid signatures be collected from 38 percent of the county's registered voters, which in Johnson County totaled 5,428, according to Frost's office. Frost sent a letter Wednesday to the Johnson County Election Commission and Quorum Court that the petition contains the sufficient signatures required to have the initiative placed on the Johnson County General Election Ballot for Nov. 8, 2016. "Our folks worked hard to gather the signatures needed to get this on the ballot," said Susan Edens, spokesperson for Keep Our Dollars in Johnson County. "We think the overwhelming response shows local residents recognize the impact alcohol sales would have on our economy, and they want to keep our dollars here in our community. The people of Johnson County have long-deserved the chance to weigh in on this issue, and we are glad that they are finally going to have that opportunity. "Our committee will spend the next few months working to educate voters about the positive impact allowing alcohol sales here will have on the community -- from generating more money for roads and services, to creating new jobs for our people. We want voters to see all the ways our citizens will benefit once we are able to Keep Our Dollars in Johnson County." Edens told The Courier in March she had half of the signatures. Two groups -- the Share Committee and Stand Strong, Stay Dry, Be Safe -- attempted to thwart any opportunity for residents to vote on the issue, she said. These opposition groups are funded by retail liquor stores in Conway County. Documents on the Arkansas Ethics Commission (AEC) website cite the Conway County Legal Beverage Association (CCLBA) as the sole contributor funding the effort to sway residents and potential voters toward keeping Johnson County dry. Edens said county line liquor stores in Blackwell were footing the bill for opposition groups. She said these liquor stores aren't so much worried about losing Clarksville residents' business, but they don't want to lose interstate travelers' business that could stop in Clarksville or Lamar instead of waiting to cross into a new county. Wal-Mart was the largest donor for the Keep Our Dollars movement. It contributed $40,000 of the group's $43,350 available funds in February. A 2014 statewide vote to legalize the manufacture, transportation and sale of alcohol in all counties, titled Issue No. 4, was voted down. Edens said Keep Our Dollars in Johnson County began when others started brainstorming ideas on how to revive downtown Clarksville. As a way to gauge community support, she set up a booth at the 2015 Peach Festival to gather signatures. In two days, she collected 500. She said 99 percent of the people supported Johnson County becoming wet. The other 1 percent didn't support the movement but usually signed so local residents could decide the issue. Courier reporter Ryan Smith contributed to this article. BY SEAN INGRAM sean@couriernews.com DANVILLE -- Since no signature petitions were submitted to the Yell County Clerk's Office by the 4 p.m. deadline Wednesday, a proposal to allow the sale of alcohol on the Nov. 8, 2016, general election ballot came to an end. Yell County Clerk Sharon Barnett and Election Coordinator Lura Kitchens confirmed they did not receive any signature petitions from people who told The Courier in February they were circulating a petition in an attempt to gather enough signatures to give county residents a chance to vote on legalizing the manufacture and sale of alcohol within the county. Barnett said the vote to legalize alcohol in the county was on the 2014 general election ballot, but it was voted down by a narrow margin: 56.9 percent voted against compared to 43.1 percent for. Bruce and Brixey Crowley said they were responsible for getting the petition started because of the potential for additional revenue if the county was wet. Several phone calls were made for this article, but they could not be reached for comment. The last time similar petitions in Pope County were circulated was in 1996, but the petitioners did not gather enough signatures to put the measure on the ballot. Pope County has not had a vote on alcohol since 1946, when 2,292 voted against legalization and 1,083 voted for it. Courier reporter Ryan Smith contributed to this article.

Kabla ya 07 Juni 2016, wakati vikao vya Bunge vikiendelea huko Dodoma, Chama Cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo (Chadema), kiliwaamuru wabunge wake kususia vikao hivyo, na badala yake kuwataka waende Shinyanga kwa ajili ya kutekeleza kitu kilichoitwa program ya “Operesheni ODETA,” ambapo neno “ODETA” linamaanisha “Okoa Demokrasia Tanzania.” Mnamo 07 Juni 2016, Jeshi la Polisi lilitoa zuio endelevu dhidi ya Operesheni ODETA, maandamano, pamoja na mikutano ya siasa za jukwaani, kwa hoja kwamba ilikuwa na “lengo la kuwahamasisha wananchi kutotii sheria za nchi,” kwa maana ya kuchochea “uasi wa kiraia” (civil disobedience) dhidi ya serikali halali. Mpaka sasa zuio hilo la kipolisi halijaondolewa. Kikatiba, katazo hili linao msingi wake katika Katiba(1977) ibara zifuatazo: 30(1), 30(2)(a), 30(2)(b) na 30(2)(f). Vifungu hivi vinasema kuwa kazi ya kukuza na kuhami maslahi ya taifa ni jambo lenye nguvu ya veto dhidi ya haki yoyote iliyotamkwa ndani ya Katiba hii. Na kisheria, linao msingi wake katika sheria ya vyama vya siasa, sura ya 258, ibara ya 11(6) ya toleo la mwaka 2002. Chadema wanao wanasheria wazuri wa kuwasaidia kuvielewa vifungu hivi. Hata hivyo, mnamo 27 JUlai 2016, Kamati Kuu ya Chadema ilikutana ili “kujadili hali ya siasa na uchumi wa Taifa tangu serikali ya awamu ya tano ilipoingia madarakani mwezi Novemba 2015.” Baada ya majadiliano marefu walifikia hitimisho kwamba, “serikali ya CCM ya awamu ya tano, chini ya Rais John Magufuli” imeanza “kuiweka demokrasia kizuizini na kuleta utawala wa Kidikteta katika nchi yetu.” Hivyo, mnamo siku hiyo ya 27 Julai 2016, Chadema walifikia maazimio makuu matatu. Azimio la kwanza, ni kwenda mahakamani kupinga kisheria maamuzi na matendo ya serikali yanayokiuka katiba na sheria za nchi. Azimio hili ni halali kwa mujibu wa Katiba (1977) ibara ya 30(3)-(5). Azimio la pili ni kuifufua Operesheni ODETA kuanzia 01 Septemba 2016, lakini safari hii ikiitwa “Operesheni UKUTA,” ambapo neno “UKUTA” linamaanisha “Umoja wa Kipinga Udikteta Tanzania.” Azimio hili ni haramu kisheria kwa kuwa ni kinyume cha katazo halali la Jeshi la Polisi lililotolewa 07 Juni 2016. Na Azimio la tatu, ni kwamba, viongozi wa Chadema katika ngazi zote za Chama kuanza maandalizi ya mikutano ya Operesheni UKUTA kupitia mikutano ya ndani itakayofanyika kati ya 27 Julai na 31 Agosti 2016. Azimio hili ni halali kisheria, endapo watazingatia kanuni za utulivu na utangamano. Kimsingi, waliorodhesha sababu 26 zifuatazo kama msingi wa programu ya “Operesheni UKUTA”: Sababu hizo ni: Mikutano ya siasa za jukwaani na maandamano kupigwa Marufuku na serikali; Kupigwa marufuku kwa safari za nje kwa watumishi wa umma; Jeshi la polisi kuagizwa kuua watuhumiwa kinyume cha sheria; Mahakama kuu kutakiwa iwahukumu kwa haraka wafanyabiashara ambao wana kesi za kodi na serikali lazima ishinde; na Serikali kuingilia Bunge na kupanga kamati za kudumu za Bunge. Pia kuna: Serikali kuzuia matangazo ya Bunge live-sikusema kwa kuwa mimi sio Mbunge; Wabunge wa Upinzani kunyanyaswa Bungeni na kuonewa na naibu Spika, Dk. Tulia Ackson; Hotuba za Upinzani kufutwa Bungeni kinyume cha Kanuni za Bunge; Bunge kurejesha fedha zake kwa Rais kinyume cha sheria; Tume ya Taifa ya Uchaguzi kurejesha fedha kwa Rais kinyume cha sheria; na Serikali kuwafukuza na kuwadhalilisha wanafunzi wa UDOM kinyume cha sheria. Kadhalika kuna: Wafanyabiashara kupelekewa bili kubwa za kodi na hata kuzuiliwa kwa Akaunti zao; Uchumi kuporomoka kwenye sekta zote nchini; Fao la kujitoa kuondolewa kwenye mifuko ya hifadhi ya jamii; Mashirika na Makampuni kulazimika kupunguza wafanyakazi kutokana na kuporomoka kwa uchumi; Mabalozi na wanadiplomasia kuzuiliwa kukutana na viongozi wa kisiasa bila kibali cha serikali; na Watumishi wa umma kulazimishwa kuwa Makada wa CCM. Vile vile kuna: Ukaguzi wa vyeti vya kidato cha nne na kutumika kama msingi wa kufukuza watu kazi hata kama ni Maprofesa; Watumishi wa umma kutumbuliwa majipu bila kufuatwa kwa sheria na kanuni za utumishi wa umma; Mawakili kuunganishwa kwenye kesi za wateja wao wanapoenda kuwatetea; Waalimu kukatwa mishahara iwapo dawati litavunjika kwenye shule yake; Tishio la kupotezwa kwa wana CCM ambao watapinga kauli ya Mwenyekiti au kuwa na maoni tofauti. Aidha kuna: Muswada wa sheria ya haki ya kupata habari na adhabu ya kifungo cha miaka kati ya 15 hadi 20; Uteuzi wa Wakurugenzi wa Halmashauri kufanyika kwa kuzingatia ukada badala ya weledi; Unyanyasaji na udhalilishaji wa wananchi Zanzibar; na Viongozi wa dini kudhalilishwa na serikali. Asilimia 98 ya madai haya ama ni uwongo au uzushi uliochanganywa na ukweli. Hivyo basi, kutokana na sababu hizi, ni wazi kwamba, Operesheni UKUTA ni program inayobeba ajenda ya kuchochea “uasi wa kiraia” dhidi ya serikali halali ya awamu ya tano. Pamoja na utata ulio katika sababu zinazotolewa kuhalalisha uasi wa kiraia kama ulivyojadiliwa hapo juu, bado Uongozi wa juu wa Chadema haujawambia wafuasi wake ukweli kwamba, maazimio haya ni programu ya “uasi wa kiraia” ili wafuasi hawa wafahamu wanachopaswa kufanya na wasichopaswa kufanya. Hata baadhi ya viongozi wa Red Brigade niliokutana nao jijini Dar es Salaam hawajui tofauti kati ya “uasi wa kiraia” unaofanyika kupitia shinikizo la amani, na “uasi wa kiraia” unaofanyika kupitia shinikizo la mabavu. Hivyo, wako wanawahamasisha wenzao kujiandaa kwa ajili ya “uasi wa kiraia” unaofanyika kupitia shinikizo la mabavu, jambo ambalo ni sawa na “jaribio la kuipindua serikali" (“uhaini”). Kwa hiyo, katika nafasi yangu kama raia mwema, najiuliza maswali kadhaa bila majawabu ya haraka: Je, hizi sababu 26 zilizoidhinishwa na wajumbe wote wa Kamati Kuu ya Chadema, wakiwemo kina Profesa Baregu, zilipitishwa kwa vile waliamini kwamba zinao ukweli ndani yake, kwa kiwango kinachohalalisha uasi wa kijamii? Je, wajumbe wa Kamati Kuu ya Chadema wanaongozwa na nadharia gani kuhusu haki na majukumu katika jumuiya inayoitwa Tanzania (A theory of moral rights and obligations in a community)? Je, wajumbe wa Kamati Kuu ya Chadema wanaongozwa na nadharia gani kuhusu umuhimu wa jumuiya za kisiasa (A theory of the purpose of political associations)? Je, wajumbe wa Kamati Kuu ya Chadema wanaongozwa na nadharia gani kuhusu chimbuko la utii wa raia kwa mamlaka halali katika jumuiya ya kisiasa (A theory of legitimate political sovereignty)? Je, wajumbe wa Kamati Kuu ya Chadema wanaongozwa na nadharia gani kuhusu mkamilishano wa kijamii (A theory of justice)? Je, wajumbe wa Kamati Kuu ya Chadema wanaongozwa na nadharia gani kuhusu maana na umantiki wa uasi wa kijamii dhidi ya mamlaka halali (A theory of civil disobedience)? Maswali haya yanaweza kutuongoza kutafuta njia bora zaidi za kutatizo matatizo yetu ya kiuchumi, kisiasa na kijamii. Hivyo, natoa wito kwa wachambuzi wa masuala haya walioko Chadema, kama vile Profesa Baregu, kukisaidia chama chao kuweka bayana mambo kadhaa kuhusu itikadi ya Chadema, ambayo ndio chimbuko la Operesheni ODETA na Operesheni UKUTA. Kimsingi, nashauri kwamba Chadema waweke bayana mambo yafuatayo matano, ambayo ndiyo maudhui ya itikadi yoyote iliyokamilika katika ulimwengu wa siasa za dola: Nadharia kuhusu haki na majukumu katika jumuiya; nadharia kuhusu umuhimu wa jumuiya za kisiasa; nadharia kuhusu chimbuko la utii wa raia kwa mamlaka halali katika jumuiya ya kisiasa; nadharia kuhusu mkamilishano wa kijamii (A theory of justice); na nadharia kuhusu uasi wa kijamii dhidi ya mamlaka halali. Baada ya kufanya tafakari kuhusu mambo haya matano, nawashauri wapitie upya hoja zao 26 ili kuona ni ngapi bado zina mashiko. Imani yangu ni kwamba, hatimaye watakuja kugundua kwamba wito wao kuhusu "uasi wa kiraia" hapa Tanzania hauna uhalali wa kisheria hata kidogo.   - 0 people likes Bramo JF Bronze Member #2 Aug 14, 2016 Joined: Oct 21, 2009 Messages: 8,214 Likes Received: 1,084 Trophy Points: 280 Operation UKUTA with No Apology   - 2 people likes swissme JF-Expert Member #3 Aug 14, 2016 Joined: Aug 15, 2013 Messages: 9,187 Likes Received: 6,014 Trophy Points: 280 tutakemea hata haya ya ccm kumuweka Jumbe kizuizini hadi mauti yamemkuta kwa kuwatetea wa Tangayika na wazanzibar. swissme   - 1 people likes Deus J.

(WLS) WLS Sunday, August 14, 2016 In 1970, a typical back-to-school shopping list for a kindergartener was four basic items and cost 73 cents. Today, that list has grown to 17 items, includes brand names, and would cost $52, at staff writer Susan Sarkauskas discovered by making her own shopping trip to a local Walmart. The reason for the uptick, educators say, is that kindergarten, and school in general, is much more serious business today. "We are focused on academics, not play," one principal said.

Preppy layers. Satin bomber jackets. There are plenty of fashion trends that experts say should help pique shoppers' interest for the back-to-school season. That could provide a sales bounce for retailers after last year's dearth of mainstream looks hurt business. The trick for shoppers: taking advantage of timing and tools to stay within a budget. In the second most- important season for retailers behind the winter holidays, families with children from kindergarten to 12th grade plan to spend an average of $673.57 on clothing, accessories, electronics, shoes and school supplies.

Preppy layers. Satin bomber jackets. There are plenty of fashion trends that experts say should help pique shoppers' interest for the back-to-school season. That could provide a sales bounce for retailers after last year's dearth of mainstream looks hurt business. The trick for shoppers: taking advantage of timing and tools to stay within a budget. In the second most- important season for retailers behind the winter holidays, families with children from kindergarten to 12th grade plan to spend an average of $673.57 on clothing, accessories, electronics, shoes and school supplies. That's up nearly 7 percent from last year, according to the National Retail Federation. The group surveyed nearly 7,000 consumers from June 30 through July 6 about their plans. Even though that survey showed signs that parents are less worried about the economy, stores are still pushing fat discounts. Some analysts say the back-to-school shopping time had a slow start, with people in no hurry to buy. Last-minute purchasing is a trend retailers have been seeing for back-to-school and the winter holidays for the past several years as mobile phones give shoppers more freedom and options. Political uncertainty is also weighing on them, says Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics LLC. "Our sense of things is that it's relatively quiet out there. There's no buildup," he said. He believes that retailers will remain aggressive with discounts. Experts say when planning back-to-school buying, it's smart to research the new looks and take stock of what's already in the closet. "Shoppers certainly have a little more money this year, but they still fundamentally want to be efficient," said Wendy Liebmann, CEO of the consulting group WSL Strategic Retail. Here are seven ways to save money on back-to-school buying: Mix new and old items If a growth spurt doesn't necessitate buying everything new, focus on a few items and take advantage of help from retailers. J.C. Penney's online site has a section called "Outfits You Love" that suggests ways to mix eight items to create two weeks of looks. "It's fashion math," says Liebmann. "It gives the feeling of lots of choices." Do the research It's easier than ever to check prices to make sure you're getting the best deal. One site, camelcamel camel.com, monitors prices on millions of Amazon.com products and sends alerts when prices drop. Apps like RedLaser and PriceJump let shoppers scan an item to see if there's a better price online. Time your buying Back-to-school discounts have already started, but the trick is knowing the best time to grab certain items. For summer clothes like short-sleeve tops, wait until the last week of August and the first week of September to reap the biggest discounts, says Benjamin Glaser, editor of DealNews, a deal comparison website. For fall clothes, try to buy the first week of October. For jeans, he says to buy later in October for the largest savings. In years past, Glaser says he's seen brands like Lucky, Levi's and Nautica cut prices by 40 percent to 60 percent during October, with few restrictions. Bulk buy the basics Stock up on items like socks and hoodies. Target's new Cat & Jack line for kids has offered $4 tank tops for girls online. Gap's Old Navy has up to 60 percent off with styles starting from $4. Old Navy is offering deep price cuts on hooded sweatshirts, selling for around $12, that Andres Dorronsoro, general manager at Old Navy merchandising for the kids' division, calls "extra cozy." Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has basic T-shirts for boys for just under $3 and leggings for girls for just under $4. Shop off-price Discounters like T.J. Maxx, Ross Stores and others are increasingly offering more items in season and are working to better curate them to the local market, says Ronen Lazar, CEO of Inturn, a technology company that works with off-price retailers to help liquidate merchandise. T.J. Maxx says that now through the beginning of September is the best time to catch trends for kids and teens, such as plaid and athletic-inspired clothing. Sales tax days Nearly 20 states offer sales-tax holidays, primarily in August, which target popular-back-to-school items like clothing and accessories. Dates vary, and shoppers need to check the restrictions for each state, says Cardhub, a credit card comparison site, which posted tips on its blog. In Connecticut, for example, shoppers can get the 6.35 percent tax waived for clothing and footwear that has a taxable value of $100 or less from Aug. 21 to Aug. 27. Look at cardhub.com/edu/sales-tax-holidays or salestaxinstitute.com for more information. Leverage store rewards Choose one store and do most of your shopping there to get the biggest benefit from its rewards program. The Kohl's programs offers $5 in rewards for every 100 points, or dollars spent. Shoppers can also sign up for programs like Plenti, which let them earn points in one store and use them in another with a single card. Earning 1,000 points will help you get at least $10 in savings at companies like Macy's and Rite Aid. Top Jobs Contemporary Chrysler • Jeep • Dodge Ram is hiring!!

Amazon | Barnes & Noble IndieBound What's a Wreck? A Cake Wreck is any cake that is unintentionally sad, silly, creepy, inappropriate - you name it. A Wreck is not necessarily a poorly-made cake; it's simply one I find funny, for any of a number of reasons. Anyone who has ever smeared frosting on a baked good has made a Wreck at one time or another, so I'm not here to vilify decorators: Cake Wrecks is just about finding the funny in unexpected, sugar-filled places.

Then puddin', these Sweets are for you! (By Teneal Ambers Cakes)   Have you seen Suicide Squad yet? (By D Liche) If so, be honest: you just went to see Harley, didn't you? :D   Well here's a fun factoid: Harley is not from a comic book. That's right, she actually originated on Batman: The Animated Series in 1992, and looked like this: (By NerdAche Cakes) In the show she befriends Poison Ivy, which is why you see those two cosplayed together so often. Granted, you probably already knew that, but I didn't until about a year ago, so I find it super fascinating.   Still, if I'm boring you: LOOK, CAKE! (By Thoughtful Cakes) Preeettty.   Harley's had a lot of different looks over the years. Here she is from the video game Arkham Asylum: (By Mike's Amazing Cakes) ...which is a great game, btw, even if you're not a huge gamer. JEN APPROVED. You don't even have to shoot anything; just mash all the buttons and watch Batman do lots of fancy jump kicks. (I'm awesome at video games, btw.)   I think I may have featured this next cake before, but it's worth a repeat: (By Dream Day Cakes) Ahhh. I want to gnaw off her little hat horns. Although I don't think they're called "hat horns." But seriously, this design is soooo good.   Another sweet-and-simple harlequin style: (By Sinful Sweets By Rosy)   Oh! Have you seen the new Vinyl Vixens from Funko? I kind of want them all. (YES I'M A GROWN WOMAN.) Especially now that I see they make pretty cool cake toppers: (By Wal-Mart. Yes, Wal-Mart. I AM SO CONFLICTED RIGHT NOW.)   Or, if you're feeling extra ambitious, here's a Harley dress cake: (By Cakes Step By Step) Complete with video tutorial! (Dang that's a lot of work!)   I am now, and will forever be a sucker for all things cute, so I'm melting over this one: (By Roxy Armenta) How genius is it to use the cartoony "bomb" fuse for a candle? Squee!   And finally, one more Margot Robbie-inspired design: (By Bella Cakes) Digging the softer colors, and of course that handpainting is amaaazing.   Hope you guys enjoyed! Happy Sunday! ***** Thank you for using our Amazon links to shop! USA, UK, Canada. Jen | 21 Comments | tagged Sunday Sweets « I Hear These Migrated About A Foot And A Half | Main | Friday Favs 8/12/16 » Reader Comments (21) To be fair about the WalMart cake, the topper makes the cake. The "cake" is just a standard design that they didn't manage to mess up. August 14, 2016 | Pez4me42 Is that second last one a birthday cake? Nice! August 14, 2016 | Denise Omg love cute Harley Quinn :D August 14, 2016 | Mindy1 When professional cakes go wrong? None of these look wrong to me! August 14, 2016 | Mabel If I won the Lotto last night, I'm going to EVERY Wal-Mart within 20 miles of my home ( just checked- there are 12!) and ordering THAT CAKE. Somehow I don't believe they will all, or even most, look that good. I'm fixated on the perfect red bow on Kennedy's cake. I want it to place on a shelf and gaze at it's realistic perfection. Sigh. August 14, 2016 | Smarie It's now officially canon (as in, said explicitly by a Marvel writer) that Harley and Ivy are an item. A lot of us out here are hoping that the contrast between her relationship with Ivy and her... whatever you want to call it... with the Joker will eventually get her to recognize how abusive the latter is, and pry her loose from it. She deserves better. August 14, 2016 | Lee Lee - Harley is a DC Comics character not Marvel. Sorry, but it had to be said! For the record, I don't get into the Marvel vs. DC rivalry, I enjoy characters and stories from both. Mabel - Welcome to Cake Wrecks! On Sundays, the cakes featured are "Sunday Sweets" to show the wreckerators how to do a cake up right. Usually the featured "Sweets" are according to a theme. I enjoy seeing the amazing talent on display each weekend after chuckling over unfortunate spelling disasters or unintentional naughty anatomical references all week. August 14, 2016 | Kat Hey watch the Walmart cake decorator jokes ;) Most of us Walmart decorators actually know what we are doing. No we may not work in fondant and gum paste but those who actually have skill can make some awesome buttercream and whipped cakes. Plus we all flub up once in awhile. So don't judge one mistake for an entire persons work. :) August 14, 2016 | Jess Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn are now officially a couple, too. It is canon. She left Joker after he tried to kill her one too many times and her best friend was there to support her - and the love blossomed. (I cosplay Harley from Arkham Knight, but made the mistake of buying the PC version since I don't have a this-generation console [PS4/Xbox One] so I haven't been able to play. =/) August 14, 2016 | Jen No offense to anyone who is into that, but I'd rather have something fun and cheerful on my cake. :^) August 14, 2016 | Jacki J Holy cow I'm on Cake Wrecks!!!!!! 😱👋🏼😅 August 14, 2016 | Roxy I should seriously order a frozen theme cake from the Wal-Mart here just to show you they're not all screw ups. Now the Wal-Mart on the other side of town are all crack heads. August 14, 2016 | J'NaeNae ....wait...you didn't know that Harley is a Timm/Dini Batman Animated original?? I'm taking 2 points off your geek cred for that! ;p And you forgot to mention that Harley was voiced by the inimitable Arleen Sorkin, still the definitive Harley Quinn, which is actually why I don't want to see Suicide Squad... I'm sorry, I know that whoever is playing her in the movie probably did her best on the character but.... Batman Animated was a key element of my childhood... I would just spend the whole movie trying to mentally replace the dialogue with Sorkin's voice. Now I'll just go pop in my Batman Animated DVD and watch "Harlequinade"..... August 14, 2016 | Nerfbomb I'm so old that when I read the Harlee Quinn headline I thought it was for the Agatha Christie sleuth https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Harley_Quin August 14, 2016 | darski I'm not a gamer, buy the free demo of Arkham Asylum (huge but free) convinced me to buy it. Now it's dirt cheap for the PC version. Years later the extent of my gaming is both Portals and all four Arkhams. Which makes the video card purchase seem a bit silly. August 15, 2016 | Craig Comic book characters? Meh! August 15, 2016 | Iggy Just in time for Boston Comic-Con! (Wish I could have gone.) Bet there were a lot of Harleys there! BTW, did you know that director Kevin Smith named his daughter after Harley Quinn? Seriously. August 15, 2016 | Roxy Random Oh thank god my cake is NOT a wreck! Happy to be featured :) August 15, 2016 | Rosy Cover up the blue half and that last one could pass as a Jem cake. Truly outrageous! August 16, 2016 | jbrecken Jbrecken - I thought I saw Jem as well on the last one! August 22, 2016 | Cecilia Maybe you should know the Wal-Mart cake is topped by an action figure. That's the Harley Quinn figure from the "Vinyl Vixens" line. October 23, 2016 | Amberk45 Post a New Comment Enter your information below to add a new comment.

She does so one child at a time. "Otherwise, I'm a nut case at the end of it," she said. Brian Hill | Staff Photographer    The length of the lists for back-to-school supplies has grown immensely over the years, as have the choices for pens, papers, notebooks, fillers, binders and more. Brian Hill | Staff Photographer    A Geneva school asks parents to purchase this multitude of items for their kindergartners. The list was much shorter in 1970. John Starks | Staff Photographer   Susan Sarkauskas Follow @dh_ssarkauskas     Envy the mom who shopped for school supplies for a kindergartner in Geneva in 1970. According to an advertisement in a local newspaper, she had to buy: • An 8-pack of crayons. • A pair of scissors. • An eraser. • A pot of paste. This week, a Geneva parent has 27 items to drop off at the school, at about 10 times the cost. The 1970 bill of 73 cents would be $4.53 in today's dollars. Filling today's list at the local Wal-Mart? $56. Nationally, a four-person household (with an average 2.2 children) will spend about $107 on school supplies, according to an annual study for the National Retail Federation. The list has grown, educators say, because kindergarten is different now. "We are focused on academics, not play," said Ami Engel, principal of Westfield Community School in Algonquin. Westfield's kindergartners attend school all day, unlike the half-day kindergartens of the 1970s. The curriculum is more rigorous. More time is spent on teaching mathematics and literacy skills that, decades ago, would have been covered in first and second grades. As recently as 1998, a survey of kindergarten teachers showed only 31 percent thought children should learn to read in kindergarten. By 2010, that figure was 80 percent, according to researchers at the University of Virginia. "As such, there are items (on the list) that help support the academic part of the school," Engel said. Thus, parents of kindergartners are asked to buy two dozen No. 2 pencils (not the fat ones of yesteryear) and a pocket folder to hold paperwork. The list grows longer the older the student gets. That same Geneva kindergartner will need 87 items by fourth grade, including two different styles of notebooks, two different-sized three-ring binders and 24 pencils. There also have been big changes in technology: Headphones and calculators are on elementary lists. Outfitting school Today's lists also contain items that aren't supplies for individual students. Almost every school asks for markers and erasers for the whiteboards that replaced chalkboards. Disinfectant wipes for cleaning hard surfaces are on many lists, as are baby wipes for cleaning hands. At least one Elgin teacher asks for a ream (500 sheets) of copier paper ($6 for Office Depot brand). Supplying that stuff does not bother Deborah Halstead of Big Rock. Her family includes teachers, and she said she knows that many of them spend their own money on supplies for classrooms. Halstead, a mother of four, was back-to-school shopping at a Wal-Mart in Batavia with her 14-year-old son, Tyler, a high school freshman. She's not a fan of schools' requesting specific brands; in particular, she's flummoxed by a list that includes a specific brand of calculator. "Are you kidding?" she said. "They all do the same darn thing!" And she doesn't buy all the loose-leaf paper requested. She swears the first year, the school asked for so much, "I had three years' worth of paper" left over. Halstead finds the shopping nerve-wracking. She does it one child, one list at a time. "Otherwise," she says, "I'm a nut case at the end of it." Brand names In defense of brand names is Kevin Skomer, principal of Louise White Elementary School in Batavia. The brands his school requests are better quality, he said. That's why the school tells parents to buy Crayola crayons. They last longer and don't break as easily. And the Crayola markers' tips don't crush easily, the ink glides on smoother, and other brands leak. "We're not sponsored by Crayola," he said with a laugh. "They last." The name-brand scissors, he said, have a design that stabilizes kindergartners' little hands. The brand cuts smooth and clean; while other brands bunch and tear the paper. The White School PTO offers a program in which parents can buy packs of supplies, and this year a PTO member tested items before the list was settled. "We're not doing it (asking for brands) just to be difficult," Skomer said. By contrast, the 1,270 students at Westfield School in Algonquin are free to bring any brand. "There's no need for brands here. In fact, we have tried to take brand names off (requests for) things," Principal Engel said. "The brand never really mattered." Backpacks on wheels? Just because something is on the special "back to school" display at the store doesn't mean the schools want you to get it. Some doctors suggest using wheeled backpacks, so kids don't hurt their backs carrying heavy bags. Westfield School says "no." Those bags "are a very sizable trip hazard," Engel said, because kids aren't very good at maneuvering them in crowded hallways. And they won't fit in some schools' lockers. Other typically banned items: gel pens and zippered binders. Most of that Geneva list can be ordered online and shipped to your house. But Engel, a mother of three as well as the Westfield principal, enjoys the hunt in the stores. "I may be in the minority," she says, "but I love shopping for school supplies."

The Devourers, by Indra Das: A European werewolf begets a son by woman he meets in an Indian bazaar in this poetic and unexpected take on shape-shifter mythology. Monterey Bay, by Lyndsay Hatton: Monterey native Hatton sets her debut novel in the Cannery Row of the 1940s and achieves more than a literary homage.

Nonfiction Almighty: Courage, Resistance, and Existential Peril in the Nuclear Age, by Dan Zak: The strangely underreported story of an 82-year-old nun who, along with two other activists, broke into a nuclear testing facility in 2012 to protest the American nuclear arms industry. White Trash: The 400 Year Untold Story of Class in America, by Nancy Isenberg: From the earliest days of indentured servitude to 21st century Walmart workers, Isenberg explores how the term “white trash” illuminates the plight of a class of people whose cross-generational poverty belies the myth of American social mobility.

When I moved back to Roswell a little more than a year ago, one of the few bright spots of relocating from a major college town was that I still had Hastings. As a vinyl-record enthusiast, I frequented the two Hastings stores in Lubbock constantly. Both locations had a hearty vinyl section and I was disappointed to discover that Roswell’s vinyl rack was just that — a small metal rack with a couple dozen records (mostly multiple copies of various “Hastings Exclusives”). Nevertheless, I was glad to have the entertainment superstore, one of the few places in Roswell that stayed open past 9 p.m. I’d go there and buy a book, then sit in the Hardback Café and read while enjoying some iced tea. Recently, I walked in, went straight to the record section as I always do and, lo and behold, sitting front and center was a first pressing of Chris Stapleton’s “Traveller” (the [auth] mega-popular album has already been pressed for a second time) and a pristine copy of “Purple Rain” by the late, great Prince. I complimented the cashier as I made my purchase — “I guess all my requests for more vinyl has finally paid off!” — and went home to spin my new tunes, feeling very optimistic about my little Hastings store. The very next day I saw the news. The company had filed bankruptcy and, barring a miracle, all inventory would be liquidated and the stores would close for good by October. It was a shot to the gut. Sure, I can go online and find anything I want, but I always felt a little bit of magic when I’d find a gem after flipping through a few hundred records. For a town like Lubbock, Hastings going out of business isn’t that big of a deal, because there are book stores, toy stores, a couple comic shops and even an independent record store, Ralph’s Records. But for towns like Roswell, Clovis and Carlsbad, the demise of Hastings is a tough pill to swallow. It’s a popular hangout for people of all ages in towns where there is no popular hangout for people of all ages. Hastings stores also provide a very diverse environment in our part of the country where edgy styles and alternative lifestyles are not always embraced by the community at large. After I was done feeling inconvenienced, I actually felt a touch of sadness. I’ve been going to Hastings stores as long as I can remember, and I’m positive I’ve patronized it twice as much as any other business, including Wal-Mart. It’s where I bought my first and last cassette tape, my first CD and my first vinyl records, which were Bob Marley’s “Greatest Hits” and a four-LP, 45 rpm, box set of Metallica’s self-titled, or “Black Album.” When the vinyl boom hit, I thought it might just be the thing that saves a company like Hastings and while it did make a profit, it wasn’t enough to supplement all the areas where they were losing money. A few years ago I spoke with a Hastings corporate employee while shopping at one of the Amarillo stores. She told me that the company was only making money on vinyl records, toys/memorabilia and books. In other words, the rental business is what sank the ship. We should all feel fortunate that we were able to hold onto a business like Hastings as long as we did. It probably should have folded long ago with the likes of Blockbuster, but the diversity of products kept the company limping along all these years. I will miss the entertainment superstores greatly. Hastings is just a fun place to hang out. The employees are friendly, usually somewhat knowledgeable about the products and do a good job of keeping the stores clean and organized. I realize its been a little while since I wrote a review on a new album, so here goes: The new Blake Shelton record is trite garbage. Avoid it. But if you really want it, Hastings probably has multiple copies and it might be slightly discounted. That’s the best thing about Hastings. No matter your taste, no matter your style, Hastings had something for you. To my fellow music, literature and pop-culture buffs out there, I feel your pain.

And social media will have an increasing influence on what they buy. Total spending for school and college is expected to increase to $75.8 billion, an 11.5 percent increase from $68 billion last year, according to a National Retail Federation survey. Of that, about $27.3 billion will be spent online. Most Popular Company to lay off 65 at LI location LI execs duke it out, raise $80G for charity LI firm helps businesses sell on Amazon Company proposes infusion of green energy Beware: Google.com may not be Google.com The average U.S. family with children in grades K-12 plans to spend $673.57 on apparel and accessories, electronics, shoes and school supplies, up from $630.36 last year, said the NRF, a trade association based in Washington, D.C. Families with college students will spend an average $888.71, down slightly from $899.18 last year, the NRF found. Although average spending will be down for back-to-college, the total spending is expected to be up at $48.5 billion compared with $43.1 billion last year, due to an increase in the number of consumers shopping, NRF said. Other sales projections are not as robust. The season will see year-over-year growth of 4.2 percent, compared with 3.8 percent in 2015, according to IHS Global Insight economist Chris Christopher. Business25 chain stores, businesses LI lost This year’s expected spending increase comes after a relatively slow year last year, as families focused on buying just the necessities, analysts said. Back-to-school spending is cyclical, often increasing one year as families stock up on supplies, then dropping off the next year as they use longer-lasting items like backpacks or computers for another year. Spending then gets a bump in the third year, when items need to be replaced, NRF found. advertisement | advertise on newsday With most Long Island public schools starting classes after Labor Day, the shopping season is just kicking into high gear, said Marshal Cohen, retail analyst with The NPD Group, a Port Washington-based market research company. Shoppers first focus on buying supplies, then clothing and other items as school starts, he said. While NRF forecast that more than a third of spending will be online this year, IHS predicts a smaller but growing percentage. This year, $1 out of every $5.40 will be spent online, compared with $1 out of $7.50 in 2011, Christopher said. “When you do your business online, it doesn’t mean you are doing more business,” Cohen said about retailers. “It just means you are moving your business online.” Free shipping and in-store pickup service are key drivers of online sales. About 84 percent of parents say they won’t shop online without free shipping, according to the NRF. Business50 chain store openings on LI Quicker shipping times, discount offers and favorable return policies also have made it more desirable, “so people are relying on the convenience,” said Danielle Conte, retail consultant and founder of shopping blog YoutailRetail.com in Centerport. “It is the Amazon effect.” Tweets from https://twitter.com/NewsdayBiz/lists/newsday-biz-staff Social media has influenced what people shop for, both online and in-store. Last year, more than one-third of U.S. teachers used Pinterest and 20 percent used Facebook for classroom curriculum and school list inspiration, NPD found. “When you have visual social media platforms, like Instagram and Pinterest, you see a lot of opportunities for brands to showcase their apparel, accessories and school supplies,” Conte said. “Social media is going to tell you what is the right look, right color, and the right brand before school starts.” To help shoppers, Walmart is providing local school supply lists in stores and a generic list on its website. Target has an online School List Assist Tool that displays lists for nearly 1 million schools, including many Long Island districts. Retailers want to give customers “the chance to shop how they want and when they want,” Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said.

Police said a 40-year-old man forcefully entered a home at 190 Market St. and was shot by a 50-year-old man who lived there. The 40-year-old man was taken to Lehigh Valley Hospital, where he was listed in stable condition. ATV reported stolen from yard MAR LIN — A thief recently stole an all-terrain vehicle from a Norwegian Township backyard, state police at Schuylkill Haven said Thursday. The incident occurred between 9:30 p.m. Aug. 4 and 5:30 a.m. Aug. 5 at 312 Beechwood Ave. The vehicle, a yellow and blue 1990 Suzuki CT500R ATV, is owned by Michael Turnista, Mar Lin, police said. Anyone with information can call state police at 570-739-1330. Police investigate sexual assault ELIZABETHVILLE — State police at Lykens are investigating a statutory sexual assault that occurred about 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at Elizabethville Park and Pool in Dauphin County. Police said a 13-year-old Lykens girl reported she had sexual intercourse with a 20-year-old Halifax man. The incident, police said, occurred in a wooded area adjacent to the park and pool. The child reported that she had previously met the man in the Elizabethville area and that she and other juvenile girls had interacted with him at the pool and park on multiple occasions prior to her having intercourse with him. Police said it was the second reported incident of this nature in the same area and ask that anyone with information on this case or similar incidents call them at 717-362-8700. Pottsville fugitive found, arraigned PORT CARBON — Port Carbon police investigated an unwanted person report about 5:10 p.m. July 26 in the borough. Police said officers were called to 329 First St. for a report that Carla L. Wingle, 45, of 11 Lake St., Pottsville, was inside a home without permission. Wingle was found at the scene and determined to be wanted on an outstanding warrant from Pottsville police. She was taken into custody and arraigned, police said. Driver extricated from car, not hurt Pottsville police investigated a crash with entrapment that was reported about 4:20 p.m. Monday in the 2200 block of West Market Street. Police said officers found a Nissan Altima that crashed into an embankment on the south side of the road near the entrance to Boyer’s parking lot. Two passengers, a 33-year-old Auburn man and a 27-year-old Auburn woman, were evaluated at the scene by EMS and required no additional treatment. Police said the driver, Joseph Farquharson, 64, of Auburn, was not injured but had to be extricated from the car by Pottsville firefighters. Police said Farquharson reported his vehicle was at Hadesty’s Hardware lot across the street. When he started the vehicle, the accelerator stuck, causing it to go through the parking lot and hit a 1999 Ford pickup truck being driven by a 30-year-old Minersville man. The car then crossed the southbound lanes of West Market Street and struck the embankment, police said. West Market Street was closed in both directions for about 30 minutes while the scene was cleared. Police search for suspected thief Pottsville police have obtained an arrest warrant for a 28-year-old Saint Clair man in connection with a theft of a 1997 Jeep Wrangler from Purcell’s Service Station, 700 Nichols St. Police said the theft occurred between 7 p.m. Aug. 3 and 3:30 a.m. Aug. 4. The SUV was recovered about 1 p.m. Aug. 4 at the Wolf Creek Reservoir in Saint Clair. The subsequent investigation revealed the vehicle had been painted with a different color and multiple items that had been purchased at Wal-Mart in Saint Clair were still inside, police said. With the assistance of Wal-Mart loss prevention, police said, they were able to obtain footage of the person parking the stolen vehicle in the store lot about 4:15 a.m., entering the store and stealing items, including those found inside the stolen vehicle. Between Aug. 5 and Aug. 7, police said, investigators also discovered social media posts suggesting the identity of the person. Officers obtained witness statements and additional evidence indicating that Matthew Sleva was responsible for the theft and eventual abandonment of the stolen vehicle, police said. A criminal complaint was prepared, charging Sleva with felony theft of an vehicle and felony receiving stolen property. A warrant also was obtained for the man’s arrest. Police ask that anyone with information call Detective Kirk Becker at 570-622-1234, Ext. 332. Police: Stolen vehicle returned Pottsville police were investigating the theft of a 2003 Chevrolet Malibu that was reported to their department Aug. 7 by a Pottsville man. The man said the vehicle was stolen sometime between 9 a.m. Aug. 4 and 7 p.m. Aug. 7 from the 1200 block of Seneca Street and that the key was stolen from inside of his home. The man contacted police Monday and said the vehicle had been returned and he did not want to pursue the investigation or have any charges filed.

She has suffered from back pain, arthritis in her knees, tinnitus, PTSD and hearing and vision loss. Photo by Caitlin Cruz/News21 by Asha Anchan, Kelsey Hightower and Caitlin Cruz The fight to feel like a veteran weighs substantially on female soldiers returning from war, though their numbers have been historic, with more than 280,000 returning from deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan in the last decade. A News21 demographic analysis shows that 17.4 percent of post-9/11 Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans are women. More than a quarter of those women are black, almost twice the proportion found in the entire U.S. population. Yet, these same women are less likely to find a job than male veterans and more likely to be a single parent with children to support, interviews and records show. They return to a nation that historically defines “veteran” as male, which in the post-9/11 era has meant a lack of female-specific resources at VA facilities across the country. A 2013 Institute of Medicine report found that women in combat-support roles, like men, experience intense warfare and constant threats on their lives, but the implications of this trauma for women has been overlooked. “Historically, research on the health of veterans has focused on the health consequences of combat service in men, and there has been little scientific research . . . of the health consequences of military service in women who served,” according to the report. Currently, 360,000 women use VA medical services. But the number is expected to double as more women come home and seek care, many of them relatively new to its services, said Dr. Patricia Hayes, chief consultant of Women’s Health Services at the VA in Washington, D.C. As of 2008, only 33 percent of the 152 VA medical centers had specified "women’s clinics," records show. Now, about 75 percent offer at least some type of female-specific care, Hayes said.   Army National Guard Spc. Crystal Sandor muscled a 5-ton truck through the ragtag roads of Iraq and likely would be dead from an exploding fireball had the 4-foot-10 soldier been just centimeters taller. Photo by Caitlin Cruz/News21 She was awarded a Purple Heart, but had to prove to the Army that she deserved it. Even back home in Ohio, she doesn’t feel much like a soldier. “What did you do over there?” some gray-haired male veterans in Akron, Ohio, at the Department of Veterans Affairs asked as they sized up her petite frame. “Did you sell Girl Scout cookies?” one asked. When Sandor’s husband goes to the VA, he gets handshakes and “Thank you for your service” accolades in the waiting room. Not Crystal. Sandor has struggled to get the care she expected from the military since the night she nearly died – June 18, 2004. She was a driver in a 20-truck convoy during a night mission in Iraq. She laughs just a little, remembering a conversation with a fellow soldier. She was razzing him for spilling sunflower seeds, a staple during their missions together. Then, a fireball from a roadside bomb came head-on toward their truck. Sandor woke up pounding on her chest to make sure she was alive. She couldn’t see, couldn’t hear. The voice of a soldier broke the chaos. “Just keep driving! Just keep driving!” “If I was that much taller,” Sandor says, putting mere centimeters between her thumb and forefinger, “I wouldn’t be alive.” After the accident and while still in Iraq, Sandor discovered her superiors lost the paperwork documenting the attack, meaning there was no official record that it ever happened. “The only reason I have the disability (rating) I have is because I was smart enough to have a video camera on me and we recorded the damage to the truck and we took pictures of everything,” she said. “That is the only reason I have a Purple Heart or disability.” Since Sandor’s return home in March 2005, she’s been at odds with the Ohio VA system over her treatment. During her first appointment later that year, she said the VA doctor seemed skeptical of her injuries, treating her as if she never left the base. When she was asked about treatment options, Sandor requested therapy to talk about the attack that injured her. Instead, she left with three prescriptions for anxiety and sleeping. She said she stopped taking the medications because she felt like a “zombie.” “I don’t think I’ve talked to one female veteran who goes to the VA who has had a good experience, that has been treated and received the care that they deserve,” Sandor said. “I think because the VA has dealt with men for so long, through all the previous wars, they’re not set up to handle females. But we’ve been at this war for 10 years, it’s about time they figure it out.” She tried group therapy at the VA, but was placed in an all-male group. She left each session feeling guilty, not better, about herself because of the horror stories the men told. For the last eight years, Sandor has bounced between her civilian doctor and the VA to prove the extent of her injuries – such as the post-traumatic stress disorder the VA denied, but her civilian doctor insists she has, along with ringing in her ears, severe arthritis in her knees, hearing and vision loss, herniated disks, a deviated septum and a brain lesion. She has a 40 percent disability rating. She tries to dismiss her concerns with the VA, keeping her focus on her 17-month-old daughter and her husband’s National Guard unit, where she volunteers to help other families. She also is pursuing a degree in public health from Kent State University, where she used the Post-9/11 GI Bill to pay for online classes. It’s been nine years since a roadside bome nearly killed her, but her PTSD continues to creep into her civilian life both physically and emotionally. “A lot of people are still like, ‘Why does it bother you? It’s been eight years, get over it,’ ” Sandor said. “It doesn’t go away, it’s with you the rest of your life. I mean, the severity of it might – how much you remember of it might – but that feeling, it’s always there.” When Hannah Siska left the Marines in 2011, she expected to find a job with the skills she acquired during her five years of service. She was a Marine in good standing. She had strong leadership skills. She had high security clearance. But she couldn’t get a job, even with her training as a special communications signals collection operator and analyst. Siska applied for more than 150 jobs posted on Department of Defense websites geared toward applicants with security clearances. The result always was the same. “They want to hire vets that are males, not females, and that was very apparent,” said Siska, who was deployed to Iraq in 2008 and 2009. “I had everything and my resume looked just like all the other guys that got jobs and I didn’t.” n September 2012, the unemployment rate for post-9/11 female veterans hit a high of 19.9 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The average unemployment rate for female veterans for all of 2012 was 12.5 percent, but that was still 3 percentage points higher than the average for male veterans that year. “Unfortunately when female veterans come home they aren’t perceived as women warriors,” said John Pickens III, a Vietnam veteran and the executive director of VeteransPlus, a nonprofit offering financial counseling to service members. A woman’s military experience isn’t seen as suitable for civilian life, despite the fact that they learned the same skills as their male counterparts, he said. “They can’t enjoy the life they’ve fought to defend and there’s a lot of pride there,” he said. Siska calls it “the boys’ club” mentality, a perception she worked against during her time as a Marine. When she joined in 2006, Siska said her superiors and fellow Marines gave her extra responsibilities because they trusted her judgment and work ethic. She sought a higher rank, but was not promoted. So she left the Marines. “I loved it, and I loved the people, I loved what I did, I just didn’t like the political aspect behind being able to move up,” she said. She described the Marines as “old fashioned,” and based on a ranking system emphasizing running and shooting scores. This mindset hinders the Marines, she said, because it discourages women from joining. In 2009, women made up 19.5 percent of officers and enlisted members in the Air Force, but only 6.4 percent of all Marines, according to the Pew Research Center. Now, Siska’s working on a biochemistry degree at Kent State University while caring for two young children. Her goal is to go to medical school and serve in the Navy. “I want to be a career person and I want to accomplish things and feel like I’m contributing to society or a community or just my family,” she said. Other than when she is in a Kent State classroom, Aribella Shapiro is always by herself. She walks everywhere because she doesn’t have a car – to school, to Walmart, to the Kent Church of Christ. On one Sunday, she leaves at least 45 minutes before the 10:45 a.m. service. The dewy grass sticks to her brown suede and rubber boots with fur around the top. She says the boots remind her of being in the Army. She cuts across the lawn of another church, passes campus, stops to get a Frappuccino at Starbucks and zigzags past Main Street and over to the church. They’re finishing a Bible study and moving on to the main worship service when she comes in and sits at the back of the 14-pew church. There are fewer than 20 people in the church; Shapiro is one of about three under the age of 35. She said she likes to try out different churches, but wants to connect somewhere so God knows she’s thankful. “I’m proud because I’m alive and I’m all in one piece,” said the 32-year-old. “I have a lot of friends who have died due to the war and I wasn’t one of them. I’m proud that I fought for America.” But she’s not proud of everything about the military, namely her rape by a superior officer. “I didn’t tell anyone because I felt embarrassed,” she said, explaining that her rapist threatened to kill her if she said anything. “I cried for months.” The crying stopped, she explains, because she talked with other women who experienced similar scenarios, and she realized her story was not unique. The Department of Defense’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office estimates that 26,000 cases of sexual assault or unwanted sexual contact occurred in fiscal 2012. Of that estimate, 3,374 cases were reported, according to that office. Shapiro joined the Army, knowing her decision to serve would pay her way through college. The Post-9/11 GI Bill brought her to Kent and it’s where she feels the most confident – sitting in class, studying for an exam or helping other students with their homework. The Post-9/11 GI Bill offers an education to those who served after Sept. 10, 2001, and has paid for nearly 1 million veterans to go to school. Post-9/11 female veterans who have a high school equivalent degree outperform non-veterans when it comes to post-secondary degree attainment, according to a News21 analysis. But many women veterans returning home to student life juggle other challenges. Only 15 percent of student veterans are “traditionally” college-aged students. Another 47 percent have children and nearly that same percentage are married. “We think that women veterans don’t necessarily want to be identified solely as veterans, as a special group, they want to be identified as women students and adult learners,” said Rachel Anderson, director of the Center for Adult and Veteran Services at Kent State University. The Independent Budget - an annual VA budget and policy analysis prepared by independent veterans service organizations - reported that researchers found women veterans have a difficult time finding support systems upon returning home. Some women reported feeling isolated, and for others this feeling is made worse by the college atmosphere. But Aribella Shapiro’s life is lonelier than she would like. She dreams of getting her bachelor’s and master’s degrees to teach English overseas, maybe even in Kuwait where she was stationed in 2004. Only this time she wants to go as “friend, not foe.” Alone in her apartment, Shapiro misses the men and women she served with in the Army. She’s trying to make connections with students in her classes, through the roommate she hopes to get by putting up signs around campus and even with the barista at Starbucks. But going from being in the Army to being by herself is difficult especially, as a single person, she said. And when asked if she felt welcomed home, Shapiro answered immediately: “No.” She described the TV shows that show soldiers coming home to their families and the emotional reunions that cue tears and hugs. “What about us soldiers that were single and we don’t have a family to come home to? Why can’t you appreciate us for what we do too?” she said. Briana Hawkes’ Army dress blues hang pressed and ready in her parents’ basement in Bristolville, Ohio. The basement is where Hawkes is living for the next two-and-a-half years. She converted it into her own studio apartment while she’s home and is willing to hang her clothes on a metal rod suspended from the ceiling because she knows it’s only temporary. The 25-year-old single mother served as an E-5 supply sergeant in Kandahar, Afghanistan, in 2012 and is home to use the Post-9/11 GI Bill to get her degree and join the ROTC program at Kent State University. After she graduates and becomes a commissioned officer, Hawkes plans to re-enter the Army and continue her military career. According to the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA), many women carry the burden of caring for children while they are deployed. More than 40 percent of women on active duty have children and more than 30,000 single mothers have deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan since 2009. “Especially as more women are involved and we see continued deployments we need to be cognizant how deployments are impacting families,” said Kate O’Gorman, political director at IAVA. “We have to make sure that service members that deploy can’t be worried about their kids constantly. There needs to be a strong system at home so they can execute their job overseas.” But parents still will worry – both during and after deployment. Hawkes is young to hold the rank of E-5 supply sergeant. She’s typically in charge of soldiers with at least six years on her, she said, and it hasn’t been easy to achieve this level of leadership. “It’s really cut-throat out there,” Hawkes said, describing the way some sergeants stop soldiers from moving up in rank because they don’t want to be passed up. “I’ve seen it and I’ve been through it and I’ve conquered it.” Coming home to get a degree and care for her daughter is a major contrast to the rigor of her military lifestyle. She is used to straight lines, strict rules and order. But on campus, students walk around wearing whatever they want, smoking and talking on their cell phones. You’re not allowed to do that in the Army. Thinking about going back to the Army in two-and-a-half years is hard, especially after spending concentrated time with her 3-year-old daughter, but Hawkes knows it’s a decision she’s going to stand by. “I plan on going until there’s no more go in me,” she said. “If that is one star, two star, I’m not stopping . . . I have a daughter to take care of and I know she’s going to have needs and college so I’m going to provide.” Asha Anchan was a Peter Kiewit Foundation Fellow, Kelsey Hightower an Ethics and Excellence in Journalism Foundation Fellow and Caitlin Cruz a Women & Philanthropy Fellow for News21 this summer.

Wade was recognized as the hospital’s March 2015 Employee of the Month and 2015 Employee of the Year. SEARCY  Four years ago during Stephanie Wade’s first delivery as an obstetrics nurse, she said she was terrified. “You’re thinking the whole time, ‘Am I going to be good enough?’ and, ‘Are my skills good enough to assess to know what I’m doing?’” But Wade said if you didn’t have that worry, you wouldn’t be a good nurse. Wade, a registered nurse and certified lactation counselor with White River Medical Center’s maternity department, was named the hospital’s March 2015 Employee of the Month and 2015 Employee of the Year. She said she loves the field and her role. “It’s wonderful,” she said. “I don’t know how else to describe it. It’s exactly what I want to be doing with my life.” Before becoming an OB nurse, Wade, who received her nursing degree from the University of Arkansas Community College at Batesville and her Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Texas at Arlington, worked in surgery for nine years. She said landing the job as a nurse at White River Medical Center four years ago was a dream come true. “I always knew I wanted to do this,” she said. “I didn’t think I could at first, so I spent the first half of my life in secretarial and accounting. And then after I had my son in 2000, I decided I was going to go ahead and go to school for my nursing [degree] and spent time doing that.” According to the White River Health System, Wade was recognized as the March 2015 Employee of the Month for her positive attitude. She said she wasn’t expecting the award. “That was exciting because I didn’t even realize people knew that I was here,” she said. Each White River Medical Center Employee of the Month votes for one of the winners to be named the Employee of the Year at the end-of-the-year banquet. As part of that award, Wade received a check and a special designated parking spot, which she shares with co-workers on her days off. “I never expected to hear my name called,” she said. “My husband and everybody said you would have thought I won the Publisher’s Clearinghouse the way I acted. It was an honor. I was never so honored in my life.” Wade said she thinks she received the award because she cares for her fellow staff members the same way she cares for patients. “I try to always have a smile,” she said. “I love my job. I try to promote the positivity, and I think that shows.” As someone who has experience with more than 100 deliveries, Wade said a typical day at work is actually atypical. “Like this morning, I had planned on coming in and having this labor,” she said. “We thought we were going to labor all day. Well I come in, get a report, and boy, we’re having the baby in 25 minutes. Forget this ‘long labor day.’ You can start out with one, and people walk in the door two or three at a time with their water broke, and you will be delivering two or three babies at once.” Wade’s nursing style uses a mix of bonding and humor. She also enjoys educating patients on how their bodies change throughout and after pregnancy. “I like to get to know them, not just on a nurse-patient relationship,” she said. “I want to know about them and their family and just be part of their day. I want to make them feel like I’m part of their family, and I’m taking care of them as if I would if they were my daughter.” Wade spends about 24 to 48 hours with each patient as they stay at the hospital. “But I see all my patients in Walmart, and I don’t even remember them half the time, and they say, ‘Stephanie!’ and show me their babies,” she said. “So I guess, really, I have a lifelong relationship with them in a way because of that. I remember my delivery nurses very well, and that’s been a long time ago.” Wade, who typically works three to five days a week, has been spending recent weeks working four days a week. A few of her co-workers are on maternity leave, and other nurses have been working more to help. “We actually have babies among our group, too,” she said. “It’s actually like we’re all family.” Her family of co-workers at the medical center have helped Wade grow as a nurse, she said. “We have the best teamwork, support,” she said. “We’re all like sisters up here; we really are. We depend on each other. We’re there for each other. Even though you’re the primary nurse for a labor, you’re never alone.” While working with new mothers and infants is “wonderful,” Wade said, it can present a lot of stressful situations that some people may not realize. “People think it’s the happy time, having a baby, but they don’t see the underlying things that are really scary, the things that could go wrong,” she said. “Watching out during the labor, you’re watching the monitor, making sure the baby is oxygenated and doing fine with that. So you’re stressed over all that. And then, when they get here, and the baby is healthy and the moms are good and everything, and you know everything’s going well, it’s just a sense of relief and accomplishment. And then you’ve got the times when people come in and it’s not so happy. It’s not happy at all, and you’re there for them.” Some hopeful nurses may carry certain misconceptions about the role, too, she explained. “A lot of the misconception is, ‘Oh, we’re delivering babies; we’re going to have a baby and sit and rock them all day,’” she said. “Honestly, we don’t ever hardly get to hold the babies. We get the baby, and mom gets them. We do our checks on them, but we don’t sit and rock them. That’s what our moms are for.” Wade said nurses are also constantly educating themselves. “As a nurse, you’re not just only here for the patients, but you’re also always wanting to provide what’s called evidence-based nursing,” she said. “It’s important to keep up with your education, to keep up with the changes going on in health care, to be able to give the best care to your patients.” She could work in any hospital department and feel at home, but Wade said OB is her true home. She said she plans to be there “forever.” Wade encourages hopeful nurses to visit other nurses in their field of interest and learn about how fun it is. “The best part about being a nurse is making a difference in someone’s life,” she said. “That’s it — knowing that I’ve been there to help them through either happy times, tough times, anything, just knowing that I make a difference. That’s what’s so important.” Staff writer Syd Hayman can be reached at (501) 244-4307 or shayman@arkansasonline.com. Tweet ADVERTISEMENT More News White Co. Central High becomes School of Inno...

 One of Wall Street's most outspoken strategists succinctly captures how dull the market is right now Akin Oyedele Aug. 9, 2016, 8:18 AM 5,799 facebook linkedin twitter email print Bill Smith/flickr It is summer on Wall Street. This means that at some point in August, a lull hits markets as traders take time off and trading volumes drop. Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid is one of the more colorful and forthright strategists on Wall Street. On Tuesday, his daily "Early Morning Reid" started, as usual, with a personal anecdote. And this one captures the market's quietness right now. Here's an excerpt (emphasis added): "Talking of TV, when I was a kid there was a program entitled 'Why Don't You' with the subtitle 'just switch off your television set and do something less boring instead.' It can be filed under 'turkeys voting for Xmas.' However today's EMR feels similar. It's been a genuinely dull 24 hours and if you want to have 5 minutes you won't ever get back to do something else less boring instead then feel free to ignore the rest of this report." No major US economic data was released on Monday, and it was one of the lightest trading sessions of the year. As of Tuesday, the S&P 500 had not closed up or down by more than 1% for 21 straight days. Of course, this doesn't mean that nothing is going on. On Monday, crude oil rose 2% after the oil group OPEC announced that it would hold an informal meeting in September, raising hopes of talks toward some kind of production freeze. Also, Walmart confirmed that it bought Jet.com for $3 billion, as earlier reported. And Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump made a big speech on the economy. It could be another quiet day on Wall Street with no major market-moving data and stocks already going nowhere in futures trading.

Michael E. Shaw, 58, who listed addresses on South Smith Road in Urbana and the 2600 block of West Springfield Avenue, Champaign, was arrested for burglary for allegedly entering a man’s garage and stealing a vacuum and theft for stealing from another home. An Urbana police report said a resident in the 1300 block of Ogelthorpe Avenue reported seeing a man, later identified as Shaw, come in his garage about 11:45 a.m. Friday and take a vacuum. The man chased the intruder but lost sight of him. About 20 minutes later, Urbana police found Shaw near Kinch Street and Florida Avenue and found that he had allegedly stolen electronic equipment from the back porch of a home in the 1600 block of Kinch Street. Police also learned that Shaw was wanted on a warrant for failing to appear in court in a burglary case to which he had pleaded guilty on June 30. In that case, he admitted going in the Urbana Walmart intending to steal. Three weeks after Shaw’s guilty plea, the state’s attorney’s office took steps to revoke Shaw’s probation but he failed to show up Aug. 8 for the hearing on the petition and Judge Heidi Ladd issued a warrant for his arrest. Shaw remained in the county jail over the weekend in lieu of $25,000 bond in the burglary case. He was expected to be formally charged on Monday in connection with the Friday incidents.   Sections (2):News, Local Topics (1):Courts, Police, Fire More Local Teacher of the Week: Cindy Ditchfield Champaign Pekingese has something to bark about Judge happy to be heading home to new position Bidding for Mahomet's Sangamon School starts in January More Local Teacher of the Week: Cindy Ditchfield Champaign Pekingese has something to bark about Judge happy to be heading home to new position Bidding for Mahomet's Sangamon School starts in January Join the Conversation Comments News-Gazette.com embraces discussion of both community and world issues.

By Joyce M. Rosenberg Joyce M. Rosenberg Denton Record-Chronicle AP Business Writer Published: 13 August 2016 03:29 PM NEW YORK — When Terina McKinney displays her leather bags and belts at events attended primarily by black women, they are often interested in her designs, and in her experience as an African-American business owner. But she seldom makes sales. “They all ooh and ahh and ask a ton of questions, but don’t necessarily make purchases,” says McKinney, whose Jypsea Leathergoods products range from $20 to $325. Instead, her customers tend to be white or Asian women. While calls have been increasing for black consumers to support black-owned businesses with their buying power estimated at more than $1.2 trillion a year, social media campaigns with momentum like #buyblack are relatively new. And McKinney’s frustration is shared by some other black business owners who say they can find it hard to sell to black consumers. The factors can be logistical or practical, such as being located farther away or having higher prices than big chain stories, retail experts and civic leaders say. Scarcity can be a reason: It can be hard to find businesses owned by African-Americans. But other considerations might be emotional, like wanting a trendy design everyone is wearing, or the perception that national brands are better. “There’s a myth that’s been placed on our communities for many generations: White people’s ice is colder. White businesses are superior to black businesses,” says Ron Busby, president of the U.S. Black Chambers, a national business organization for black-owned companies. “We have to change that mentality. We have to be better, conscientious consumers.” McKinney, who lives in Camden, New Jersey, outside of Philadelphia, says her lower sales to black shoppers don’t seem to be a matter of money, since she finds that many will spend on well-known labels. Designer Joede Brown has seen similar responses to her crocheted clothing, which sells under the Black Pearl Creations brand from under $30 to up to $500 for the most intricate pieces. She finds black customers sometimes say her products are too expensive, although they’ll wear a big-name brand that costs the same or more. Brown, who lives in Manchester, New Hampshire, recognizes that a preference for well-known brands isn’t limited to the black community, but also wonders if buying them is a statement: “You’ve beaten me down, but look, I can have this too.” Consumers who do try to focus their spending on black-owned companies say finding them requires research, and it can take more time and effort to get there. But locating options is getting far easier, both through local and national social media campaigns and online lists from groups like the U.S. Black Chambers. “This is the only way we as a people can generate wealth, by supporting our own,” says Rebecca Briscoe, of Houston. Her grandfather’s photography company was black-owned and focused on black customers from the 1940s onward because white photographers would not do business with them. “If you don’t support their business, they don’t have a business,” says Briscoe. Campaigns like #buyblack and also #bankblack, which encourages people to use black-owned financial institutions, are having an impact. The #bankblack campaign got a boost last month from rapper and activist Killer Mike, who called on people to shift their money to these banks. OneUnited Bank has gone from 50 new accounts a day to as many as 1,000, says Teri Williams, president of the financial institution that has offices in Boston, Miami and Los Angeles and also operates online. “It’s opening the community’s eyes to the many ways they’re spending their dollars,” Williams says of the campaigns. Businesses that provide a service may have more success than those that sell merchandise, says Jerome Williams, a marketing professor at Rutgers University. “Since service businesses tend to involve more people interactions, the people relationships should prove to be more important, compared to situations where the focus is primarily on the product,” he says. Small and medium-sized retailers can find it hard to compete on price and selection with giants such as Wal-Mart that can negotiate lower prices with manufacturers through their scale. And finding black retailers and service providers across a range of industries isn’t always easy, Jerome Williams says. “As a black consumer, if I wanted to buy from a black-owned merchant, there aren’t enough to satisfy my needs,” he says. The nearly 2.6 million black-owned companies in the United States account for about 9 percent of the total number of businesses in a country where 13 percent of the population is black. The 2012 census of businesses found that black-owned operations made up about 6 percent of all U.S. retailers and about 7 percent of businesses that provide food or accommodation. Financial counselor Harrine Freeman has black-owned beauty supply and clothing stores, a dollar store, shoe repair and other service providers not too far from her Washington, D.C., home. She has searched online or asked friends and neighbors to find other businesses. But other black-owned stores might be an hour’s drive away. “I’m willing to drive that far, but that’s not to say I can go there every week,” Freeman says. Black-owned businesses offer black consumers distinct advantages — especially if shoppers have felt discriminated against at other places — and can provide services tailored to their needs, says Geraldine Henderson, a marketing professor at Loyola University in Chicago. She cited health care providers who understand medical concerns that may be more relevant to black patients. “You want to go to a provider with cultural competence,” Henderson says.

Expat in mexico. Reliable High Speed Internet In Tijuana Hey guys! So, I've been here a couple weeks now. Loving it so far. Got my apartment in Playas, and have my second visa appointment in a few days in Seattle. (Trying to get a copy of my rental contract to show them is another story, since my landlord is on vacation ) LOL But, it's coming time for me to choose an internet provider. The landlord insists he loves Izzi/CableMas but I have heard nightmare stories about their customer service, and also that the service is unreliable. I can't go days without internet or something which seems to be a thing with them... so I was wondering if anyone else had other suggestions. I keep seeing the TotalPlay package which looks awesome, whenever I go to Walmart, but I know nothing about them and my Spanish is not great enough to listen to the reviews of each company on Youtube in the way I would like. So, who do you use in TJ, Telnor, Izzi, TotalPlay, someone else? Thanks!   #2 (permalink)   14th August 2016, 03:24 AM NCas New Member   Join Date: Sep 2013 Location: Queretaro Posts: 34 Rep Power: 0 6 likes received Originally from usa. Expat in mexico. To put in my two cents none of of the ISP have good customer service. I don't live in Tijuana yet, but I'm hoping to move there from Queretaro within the next month. I've had both MegaCable and Telmex for ISP while here in Mexico. With MegaCable you get more bang for the buck. First time I signed up it took them two weeks to actually get me set up. After that I rarely had an issue though it did go out but not more than a couple of days at the most. Be aware that MegaCable if you don't give them a credit card to bill to you'll have to go to a branch or pay your bill at an OXO. In the third house I've move to I had a faster installation. However, I've been having issues where the speed of my internet has decreased significantly for several hours once or twice a month. I've had the technicians come in on 3 separate occasions, but they have not been able to figure out what causes it. I had TelMex in the second house I lived in because MegaCable was did not provide service in that area. They are much more expensive, but are usually better at customer service. However, they were only able to provide DSL speeds 5 MB for $350 per month. I was paying $450 for 20MB with MegaCable. Both companies will provide a modem with wireless capabilities. I would recommend that you get your own WiFi modem to hook up as I don't feel they are all that great. I've heard much like yourself that TotalPlay is decent, but as far as I know they do not have any branches you can go in case you have an issue. Axtel advertised as one of the fastest and more reliable ISP's. I've been wanting to try them as they seem to have an all fiber optic network. They are also more expensive and you'll have to see if they provide coverage in your area. Hopefully this will help you get a better idea on ISP down here. Hey I'm tying to figure out what would be some good neighborhoods where I can rent a house. I'm not really looking for anything fancy, but I would also like to live in a fairly safe area. How do you go about finding a place to live up there?

Expat in mexico. Thanks so much for letting me know your experience! I've been using the wifi hotspot on my phone with t-mobile which still works, roaming on TelCel, and that's OK but I only have unlimited data on my phone itself and not through the hotspot feature... and it won't last the whole month because my job is kinda data hog-ish. I may try TotalPlay just because they advertise the highest speeds I have found and it's fiber optic, but idk. I also will be setting up TV service and Izzi has a DVR feature whereas TotalPlay does not.... I dunno how much that kind of thing will sway my decision though. In terms of finding a place to live, well it was kind of a saga... I looked online for a few weeks before I made the jump to come down here, but wasn't super happy with what I found unless it was basically out in the middle of nowhere. Once I got here, I made a reservation on Expedia at a hotel cheap but nice in Centro and stayed there about a week figuring a few things out. I took UberEnglish a lot, and started telling the drivers and everyone I came into contact with that I was looking for an apartment. Most people didn't know of any at the time really, but a few gave me some leads and we talked about various neighborhoods around TJ. The area I was in was not horrible, but it wasn't really my scene. Playas de TJ kept coming up and it was one of the places I had in my sights anyway. One of the guys here had previously recommended this cute hotel there, but I had been afraid to just show up in case they had no availability like some other places in the area, and then I forgot the name. One day, I just said "screw it" and got another Uber driver who was up to taking me out there and driving me around. I fell in love with the area, it was super relaxed, beautiful and much cooler temperature wise. He called some of his friends who knew of some other off the beaten path hotels, and we went to those, most of which were also full, but our last stop was...right on the main road into Playas and.... the cute little place that was recommended to me here... which I recognized from prior pictures. They had availability, and let me basically put down a good faith deposit on my room in spite of not needing to check in until later in the week! Awesome. Once I got there, the son of the owners accidentally changed my room assignment and put me in their worst room which got basically no wifi signal, and he could not remember the wifi password to the one network that room did get a signal to. It was funny, but I had to work that night and needed internet... so after some conversation he rigged me up with an extension cord through the front of the place, and I sat outside in the courtyard all night working while enjoying the night/beachy air. Then he got interested in what I do for a living, and in talking about that it came up I was looking for an apartment in Playas. He thought for a minute and then it came up that he had an apartment at a building he and his parents own that I might like... 2 bedrooms, 1 bath, decent kitchen, decent area, ground floor, and close to the beach... and he could probably give it to me for around $450 or so. I went to look at it as soon as I could, and immediately said yes. It's not perfect, but the setup is great, it's spacious, I finally have a room for an office which I could not afford in LA, I'm 2 blocks from the beach, and a short ride/walk from Walmart and pretty much everything I could want, my landlord speaks English and is super chill so far and it's really great. Since then I have heard of places that are similarly nice for even a little cheaper but it really depends on who you talk to. As an aside, there is a guy advertising studio apartments in the same area roughly as me, for the same price that I am paying for my 2 bedroom, but that was on CL so just be vigilant. I did find some groups on FB to be a bit more reasonable in what they were asking for various properties since they weren't necessarily targeting gringos... so you may want to start there, but many people would post things that were not even remotely in the neighborhood, in a group specifically about Playas, so you have to know where you are.... And as everyone has mentioned, word of mouth won out for me.   #4 (permalink)   14th August 2016, 10:37 PM NCas New Member   Join Date: Sep 2013 Location: Queretaro Posts: 34 Rep Power: 0 6 likes received Originally from usa.

Wish me luck and let me know what your experience is with the ISP you settle on. Soon I'll have to start deciding on an ISP myself.   #5 (permalink)   15th August 2016, 04:22 AM perropedorro Member   Join Date: Mar 2016 Location: El Lay ----> Playas Colimenses Posts: 271 Rep Power: 0 211 likes received 204 likes given Originally from usa.

Internet is always a bright spot for American expats because the U.S. has the most abusive ISP costs in the world so just about anywhere you move you'll be paying less and/or getting more. In Mexico, the standard is Telmex Infinitum, usually the only game in town for rural areas and small or mid-sized cities. At 380 pesos/month I get the same speed and reliability I was paying over 3x for (60 bucks) for from Charter in SoCal. In larger Mexican cities like TJ there's competition so you might find an even better deal.   #6 (permalink)   15th August 2016, 01:26 PM drewjones New Member   Join Date: Aug 2016 Location: Playas de Tijuana Posts: 11 Rep Power: 0 5 likes received Originally from usa.

What you do is go into the office and tell them you want service and a few days later the installer will show up to install the service. What I had to do when I first got here is get telephone and dsl service. The plan i got and still have is 20mb upload and 5mb download for 35 a month. I do not know if they still offer that but its the fastest plan down here for residential. Since then, I have moved and got fiber. The fiber is nice because you can drop your phone service if you want. Same speeds, not much difference. Here to help! BTW T-Mobile is the best cell service down here because of the free roaming and the wifi calling while you are down here.   #7 (permalink)   15th August 2016, 01:38 PM drewjones New Member   Join Date: Aug 2016 Location: Playas de Tijuana Posts: 11 Rep Power: 0 5 likes received Originally from usa. Expat in mexico. For apartment hunting here in Playas is to take a few hours and drive around. There are plenty pf apt's here in playas available for rent. My first apt was 1 block from the beach for $230 with a balcony overlooking the beach. It took me about 2 hours of driving around to find the place. People are always willing to help ya out getting situated down here. Best thing to do when driving across the border is applying for the sentry pass. It will save you tons of time crossing the border, driving or even walking. Apply online. It will take up to 6-9 months to get approved. https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-t...rograms/sentri   #8 (permalink)   19th August 2016, 02:30 AM NCas New Member   Join Date: Sep 2013 Location: Queretaro Posts: 34 Rep Power: 0 6 likes received Originally from usa.

Wow $230 I hope I'm as fortunate to find something like that in that area. I'll definitely try my luck.   #9 (permalink)   22nd August 2016, 05:43 AM GimpLostAndLovinIt New Member   Join Date: Jan 2013 Location: Los Angeles Posts: 22 Rep Power: 0 11 likes received 9 likes given Originally from usa. Expat in mexico. Man today has been interesting on the "getting internet installed" front. I met my neighbor in the apartment next to me, and he had service with the company I'd been considering the most. Told me he had a good experience with them, and that they came quickly to install, so I contacted them and they said they could install today... between 9 AM and 2 PM... so I waited.... and waited... and waited... chatted with their support and was advised of delays... my window of installation got stretched out until 4 PM... then 5... then 6... then 8... then 9... which is when they stop. During this time, their offices for phone support closed. Their chat support went offline as well... and no one showed up to install my service. I should probably maybe be a bit more upset than I am considering I wasted all day at home waiting for them, but meh, whatever I guess I will try again tomorrow. This is only made slightly more annoying by the fact that I broke my smartphone recently, so unless I am tied to skype on my home computer, they have no way to reach me if needed... until I replace my smartphone. I wouldn't say it was necessarily a bad experience either, nor does it really make me not want to use the service... I got to test their speeds on my neigbors connection and they're true to their word about what they can provide... plus their support people did their best to try and keep me informed when I did reach out, but man... to be installing 12 hours a day and still not get to everyone on their appointment list... dang.

Hang in there GimpLost. Hopefully they'll get it up and running at your place before the end of the week. If they are able to install it tomorrow great, but prepare yourself to have this scenario again tomorrow.

The pay was lousy, the heat oppressive, and the work was exhausting.  Many nights I would collapse, fully clothed, on my mattress on the floor of the dingy, mouse-infested apartment I rented. But before I hit the sack, there was one thing I usually looked forward to: your Superbar (now defunct).  For about $3.00 I could get my fill of salad, fruit, Mexican food, and pasta. And that’s the only reason I’m writing you today, Wendy’s.  I have nostalgic feelings for your SuperBar, even though I now know it’s tainted.   But I’m offering you a heads up anyway: the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) is coming for you, and you will lose. That’s not a threat, it’s a statement of fact. The CIW is the most effective, winningest anti-poverty group I know.  It was founded in 1993 by a small group of farmworkers in little-known Immokalee, Florida.  They had the audacity to believe that they could take on the state’s agriculture industry—once described by a federal prosecutor as “ground zero for modern slavery”—and fundamentally change the business. The harsh opposition and backwards thinking that the workers needed to overcome was evident during a hunger strike in 1997, when the farmworkers’ single demand was a dialogue with the tomato growers.  One grower told the CIW, “Let me put it to you like this—the tractor doesn’t tell the farmer how to run the farm.” The CIW is coming for you, and you will lose.But ultimately, the farmworkers’ unity and savvy tactics led to most tomato growers in South Florida coming to the table and reforming their practices.  Today, the CIW is internationally recognized for its wins in addressing social responsibility, human trafficking, and gender-based violence.  But nothing epitomizes their work more than the Fair Food Program (FFP), which protects workers by creating real economic consequences for violations of human and labor rights. And that brings us back to you, Wendy’s.  The CIW announced a national Wendy’s boycott because you are theonly major fast food corporation that has not signed onto the FFP—and that matters. Under the FFP, corporations pay an extra penny per pound for tomatoes in order to support better working conditions for farmworkers.  They also agree to buy only from growers who sign a code of conduct—which forbids things like forced labor and sexual harassment—and is drafted by the workers themselves. There is worker-to-worker education on their new rights, a 24-hour hotline for complaints, and workers monitor their own workplaces. Plus, the Fair Food Standards Council conducts regular audits, investigates complaints, and monitors resolutions at the approximately 17 participating growers; these growers account for 90 percent of the $650 million in annual revenues in the Florida tomato industry. Human rights and labor violations in the fields have real market consequences.When major violations occur and aren’t corrected, corporations stop buying from the offending growers, which means human rights and labor violations in the fields have real market consequences: respect for workers is rewarded, abuse leads to significant financial loss.  That’s why the system works, plain and simple, and it’s why the New York Times described it as “the best workplace-monitoring program” in the U.S. The Obama Administration even awarded the FFP a Presidential Medal for “extraordinary efforts in combatting human trafficking.” At this point, your refusal to sign on simply makes you seem wildly behind the times.  Not only are all of your fast food competitors signatories to the program, but so are major corporations like Walmart, Whole Foods, Aramark, and Trader Joe’s.  Some joined willingly, others put up a fight—but in the end the CIW always got the result it wanted. And they will with you, too. Maybe you believe your internal controls are sufficient, as your spokesperson indicated: “We believe that our supplier code of conduct provides important standards in this area, and we will continue to evaluate the best way to promote responsible business practices in our supply chain.” But that statement rings hollow, especially since you have left the growers in Florida who—through their participation in the FFP—are proving their commitment to ending abuses like forced labor, child labor, sexual assault, wage theft, and other workplace violations.  Not only that, multiple growers say that you informed them that the FFP is the reason you are leaving Florida.  (I would have loved for you to respond to this allegation, Wendy’s, but you declined my invitation to comment.) Instead, you are now purchasing tomatoes from Mexico. The Department of Labor (DOL) lists Mexico as one of just three countries where child labor is used in thetomato fields.  And one of the major growers you now do business with—Bioparques de Occidente—has a disturbing history. As Harper’s Magazine notes, Bioparques workers who were interviewed for an investigative series described “subhuman conditions, with workers forced to work without pay, trapped for months at a time in scorpion-infested camps, often without beds, fed on scraps, and beaten when they tried to quit.”  According to the LA Times, among those trapped in the camps were “two dozen malnourished children.” You seem almost bizarrely unaware—or unconcerned—with the idea that the truth will out.And yet you seem almost bizarrely unaware—or unconcerned—with the idea that the truth will out. Even after the boycott launch, you ran an ad boasting that you purchase beef here in America in contrast to some of your competitors.  That ad includes an image of a juicy burger with bright red tomatoes—which were quite possibly grown on farms in Mexico where gross human rights violations occurred. But the CIW and its allies are onto you. So now there are students organizing to kick you off of their campuses, just as they did more than a decade ago when the CIW launched its successful boycott against Taco Bell.  The faith community is mobilizing against you, too.  You were the target of the biggest protest march ever to occur in Palm Beach, Florida, home to Wendy’s largest shareholder, Nelson Peltz.  And next month you will see what solidarity and a powerful, diverse coalition looks like at the Wendy’s Boycott Summit in Immokalee itself. So yeah, I’m boycotting you, Wendy’s, but I’m not the one you have to worry about.  You can join your competitors, get on the right side of history, and make it easier on yourself.  Or you can keep on refusing to protect farmworkers, tarnish your brand, and then lose. © 2016 TalkPoverty.org Greg Kaufmann Greg Kaufmann is a Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress and Editor of TalkPoverty.org.

Some of us stay in town, while others go up north to squeeze all they can out of the nice weather, and some travel out-of-state to explore a new city or landscape. However we choose to spend our vacations, they tend to bring out the explorer in us.  While some people prefer the more traditional approach, of having a whole trip planned out in advance, others appreciate the surprise and wonder that a more 'improvised' vacation can bring. This week, we bring you two stories from people who went out of their comfort zones...and lived to tell the tale. Dana Lovrek shared her story in January, 2011, at the "It Gets Better" event. She recalls the time her family took a trip to Colorado.  After her father made an impulse buy at Walmart, things got interesting. Storyteller Bob Pothier. Credit Kathrine Schleicher Another man liking to do things on a whim, Bob Pothier got engaged to his wife Virginia ten days after they met. He took to the stage in January 2010, speaking to the theme of "Busted".  That night, he recounted a story about his vacation on Myrtle Beach, which included a fair amount of mischief.    Tags:  Ex Fabula Lake Effect TweetShareGoogle+Email Related Content Ex Fabula: Finding Community 3 months ago Ex Fabula: Spirituality 3 months ago Ex Fabula: The Art of Creativity 4 months ago Ex Fabula: Love 4 months ago Milwaukee Public Media is a service of UW-Milwaukee's College of Letters & Science © 2016 WUWM Contact Us Facebook Twitter Contest Rules

Luke Starcevich was killed in Iraq in 2007, proudly hold up his photo along with their winning Harley-Davidson raffle ticket Monday at their home in Tolono. Image Image TOLONO — Their heroic son's birthdate proved lucky for Rick and Ava Tomson, who just won a motorcycle in a raffle. They used his birthday — June 6, the same as D-Day — in the Marine Corps League Post 1231 raffle for a 2016 Harley-Davidson CVO Street Glide worth about $35,000. The raffle helped support the Chez Family Foundation Center for Wounded Veterans in Higher Education at the University of Illinois. But the win had a bittersweet edge. Their son, Pfc. Lucas Starcevich, 25, died April 16, 2007, of wounds from a roadside bomb in Baghdad. He was 25, a graduate of Unity High School and Parkland College, and engaged to be married. Pfc. Starcevich enlisted in 2000 and was on his second deployment to Iraq. "It's still very painful; even now it's hard to believe," Ava Tomson said. "You just have to be strong and move forward. Our goal is to do things that honor his memory." She said it wouldn't be honoring his memory to politicize it, when asked about a recent Donald Trump contretemps with a Gold Star father. "I tried to stay out of" the Trump fight, she said. "Being a Gold Star parent puts you in an unusual situation. You love your soldier, and you have the war. "No one ever wins in war; in politics, that's how it is as well." She said patriotism is the most important thing. "We stay away from a lot of things. We love this country, but we're not going to be used by anyone," Tomson added. Rick Tomson is a truck driver for Wal-Mart. Ava Tomson has been active in Military Moms and Comfort Quilts, even before she became a Gold Star mother. "I still make blankets for military organizations to auction out," she said. "After Luke died, it was too hard for me to do quilts." His memory is constant. "We bought the ticket about two months ago at Buffalo Wild Wings," Rick Tomson said. "Since we were the first, we could pick any number from 1 to 700, so we picked Luke's birthday." It's a white bike, so his mother said Lucas would have liked it. They've already picked it up. The motorcycle enthusiasts had already planned a first trip, to Camp Butler in Springfield, where the private is buried. Rick said he was deeply moved by Lucas' sacrifice and downplays his own military service. "I did serve in the National Guard, but my son gave up his life," he said. "In my mind, I didn't do anything. I served in a peaceful time. Most of the time when people ask me if I served, I say no. People say, you gave the government a blank check, but in my case, they didn't cash it." There's a counseling room at the Chez Center for couples dealing with PTSD, and adjacent is a child's playroom. Ava Tomson is putting together a bookcase, which includes toys, with Joy Henderson, mother of Seth Miller, who died in Germany. "Lucas' nickname was Star, so it's the Star-Miller children's library," she said. "We'll dedicate it on 9/11. We're getting children's handprints on the bookcase: red, white and blue. A lot of the books we've ordered deal with issues that relate to deployment."

Opinion Op-Ed Op-Ed The rising number of boycotts diminishes respect for a valuable tactic BDS supporter Mike Groll / Associated Press A supporter of the pro-Palestinian boycott, divestment and sanctions movement protests in Albany, N.Y., on June 15. A supporter of the pro-Palestinian boycott, divestment and sanctions movement protests in Albany, N.Y., on June 15. (Mike Groll / Associated Press) Mark Oppenheimer Marc Gafni, an ex-rabbi who lives in Northern California, has been accused of a multitude of sins, including sexual abuse of a 13-year-old (he admitted there was sexual contact, but said she was “14 going on 35”), affairs with students and plagiarism. He now makes his living as a New Age teacher of “integral wisdom” and offers seminars on “total-body orgasms.” Earlier this year, he was repudiated by hundreds of rabbis and other spiritual leaders in an online petition covered by the national media. But one friend stood by him. In recent years, John Mackey, founder and CEO of Whole Foods, has appeared publicly with Gafni and given to Gafni’s nonprofit. “Loyalty and the presumption of innocence are important values to me,” Mackey said in June, “so I will not join those who are condemning him.” In response, Gafni’s detractors have gone after Whole Foods. “I refuse to support any company that openly backs a pedophile,” Nikki DuBose, the model turned mental-health advocate, wrote in an article for the Huffington Post. And though there is no organized boycott yet, activists held small protests in May at Whole Foods stores in New York and Los Angeles. “Whom John Mackey supports is public,” Rabbi David Ingber told Tablet magazine. “It’s part of the brand of Whole Foods, and we as consumers have a responsibility to speak out.” Another little piece of L.A.'s soul disappears, at the sleek new Petersen Automotive Museum David L. Ulin When my son Noah was little, the Petersen Automotive Museum — the car museum, we used to call it — was one of the touchstones of his world.

When my son Noah was little, the Petersen Automotive Museum — the car museum, we used to call it — was one of the touchstones of his world. In many ways, they grew up together; the Petersen opened on June 11, 1994, only a few months before Noah was born. Beginning when he was 1, we went to the... (David L. Ulin) Mackey’s support for Gafni is inexcusable. But is that cause for a boycott? It’s a timely question, because boycotts are everywhere these days. In the last few years, I have been asked to boycott the University of Illinois, Chick-fil-A, Wendy’s, the states of North Carolina and Indiana, and Israel. Those boycotts were organized by liberals, but the right is trigger-happy too. Conservatives went after JCPenney because it ran an ad featuring a male couple with children, and Target because it announced that transgender individuals could use whichever bathroom they chose at its stores. EthicalConsumer.org lists dozens of ongoing boycotts: against Air France, Bacardi, Ben & Jerry’s, China and plenty more before we even get to the letter D. Boycotts have upsides. Sometimes, a coordinated effort to persuade people not to pay for a particular service helps achieve a just result. The Montgomery bus lines were pushed near insolvency by the boycott of 1955 to 1956. Other times, economic pressure is less important than the attention a boycott brings: Most people never thought about apartheid until a worldwide boycott effort in the 1980s made South Africa a pariah. And even when they don’t seem to get results, boycotts may forge communities. The boycott supporting the Delano grape strike in California, which lasted from 1965 to 1970, not only resulted in a significant victory for labor but helped create a sense of solidarity among Latino farm workers.   Yet boycotts are crude instruments. They have unintended victims: namely, the workers who have no responsibility for policy but are adversely affected if a company loses business.  Boycotts are also selective. The call by some activists to boycott Israel for its treatment of Palestinians (the “BDS” movement, for Boycott, Divest and Sanction) has led critics to ask why the boycotters are relatively uninterested in the nation’s neighbors, like Iran, which executes gays, and Saudi Arabia, which executes gays, imprisons cross-dressers and doesn’t allow women to drive. Boycotts are becoming modes of identity, less about the boycotted and more about the boycotter. Of course, all activism is selective, and it has to begin somewhere. But it’s problematic that boycotts can only punch so high up — a boycott of the United States is absurd on its face. By contrast, Cubans were immiserated for decades by our embargo — an embargo is a forced boycott — which never did drive out the Communists. In 1990, boycotts of Korean grocers operating in two African American neighborhoods in New York City took on decidedly racist overtones. Some boycotts involve sacrifice on the part of the consumer, but many don’t. In the age of Amazon, Orbitz and ecommerce, we have so many purchasing options that eliminating one or two doesn’t entail hardship. For that reason, boycotts are becoming modes of identity, less about the boycotted and more about the boycotter. I am the kind of person who doesn’t shop at Wal-Mart because of its anti-union policies. But I know that Wal-Mart couldn’t care less. As the Christian blogger Jake Meador writes, “In the absence of real dependence upon one another, commerce has ceased to be a matter of sustaining one’s material life and the life of one’s neighborhood and has, instead, become a method for self invention.” It’s already the case that conservatives have their stores, liberals have theirs—Wal-Mart shoppers and Whole Foods shoppers don’t bump into each other much. Boycotts worsen this problem and alienate us ever more from our fellow citizens. What happens when a polarized country falls in love with the boycott? Whole states become off-limits because of legislatures’ bathroom politics. I don’t have a master theory for when to boycott and when to refrain. But at the very least, we should get back to basics. It’s creepy that Whole Foods CEO John Mackey (who did not return my calls) is a friend of Marc Gafni’s, but it’s a stretch to say that Whole Foods supports sexual abuse. Anyone who wants to boycott the company can easily find a better reason — say, its unscientific claims about what their products can do. In general, we should focus on the actions of the companies themselves, not the people who run them. And if we prioritize indisputable social ills — like the mistreatment of workers, bad science or the destruction of the environment — we can elevate a valuable tactic now diminished by overuse Mark Oppenheimer is filling in for Doyle McManus.
