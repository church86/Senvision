Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Walmart Black Friday Deals To Grab This Weekend Posted: Nov 5 2016, 11:36am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 7 2016, 5:13am CST, in News | Black Friday   This story may contain affiliate links.   The early Walmart Black Friday 2016 sale is underway. Here are the best deals to get this weekend. Walmart launched the early Black Friday 2016 sale on November 1. The first early Black Friday weekend features new deals in the Walmart online specials sale. Don't Miss: Black Friday 2016: Everything You Need to Know Now The deals list got enhanced by new deals on the Sony PS4 Slim and Xbox One S bundles. The weird Disney Princess Carriage Ride-On is back in stock and sells for $398. Walmart is again this year offering low cost Android tablets and tablets with keyboards. The new generation runs on Android 6.0. the 11.5-inch RCA Galileo Pro with 32GB storage almost provides a full laptop experience. Walmart lists again the $125 32-inch TCL 32S3750 Roku Smart TV deal. It is only available for pick up in a store. The TV shows up in the best-seller listing on Sunday, which suggests that there is new inventory. Check the stock at local store under Pickup Options. Walmart Black Friday Deals $125 32-inch TCL 32S3750 Roku Smart TV $398 50-inch VIZIO D50-D1 D-Series1080p 120Hz Fully Array Smart HDTV $299 Xbox One S 500GB bundle /w bonus game, movie and controller $299 Sony PS4 Slim 500GB Uncharted 4 w/ free COD: Infinite Warfare $279.99 50" Sceptre X505BV-F 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV $378 55" VIZIO D55n-E2 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV $848 65" VIZIO D65u-D2  4K Ultra HD 2160p 120Hz LED Smart HDTV $219 Apple iPad mini 2 $98 11.5" RCA Galileo Pro 32GB Tablet with Keyboard Case Android 6.0 The weirdest thing to see on the Walmart online store are the Hatchimals deals. The retailer has announced to dramatically increase the number of products offered on online through marketplace partners. Now Walmart's marketplace partners are offering Hatchimals at outragous prices of $199. The Amazon marketplace is definitely more mature and reflects the market values of Hatchimals in a much better way. The offers on amazon from 3rd parties match what Hatchimals sell for in eBay auctions. Listings like that reflect kind of badly on the image of Walmart. When you look at the page of Walmart's online specials, you see among the deals listed a $199 Hatchimals. That just does not look right. There is certainly some room for improvements of how marketplace offers should be displayed online at walmart.com, so it is clear to shoppers that these items are not sold by Walmart directly. See our Hatchimals Shopping guide for the latest on the Hatchimals stock situation. Find more early Black Friday deals picks on sale today. The highly anticipated Walmart Black Friday 2016 ad is expected to be released on November 11.

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Nov 5, 2016 at 12:01PM Image source: Getty Images. It's pretty exciting when you find a stock idea you can really get behind. We reached out to some of our top Motley Fool contributors to ask them what stocks have them jumping for joy right now. They came back with an eclectic list of intriguing stocks that includes Transdigm (NYSE:TDG), Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT), Exelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL), Align Technology (NASDAQ:ALGN), and Terra Nitrogen Company (NYSE:TNH). Are these stocks right for your portfolio? Read on to find out. This stock will continue flying high Daniel Miller: One stock I'm excited about is found within the aerospace industry, but it's not the juggernaut manufacturers you'd likely think of (like Boeing or Airbus). Rather, TransDigm is a leading designer, producer, and supplier of engineered aircraft components and systems that are used on just about every commercial and military aircraft in service. The company IPO'd roughly a decade ago and hasn't looked back. TDG data by YCharts. The good news for long-term investors is that the aerospace industry isn't slowing down, either. In fact, Boeing estimates that more than 39,000 commercial airplanes -- we're not even considering military aircraft, here -- will be needed over the next two decades thanks to a surge in Asia demand. Those airplanes are valued at more than $5.9 trillion, and TransDigm's business should carve out its fair share of that pie. TransDigm also possesses competitive advantages that should last for the long term. It has intellectual property on its products that are produced according to strict FAA certifications. Further, for those unaware of the process, once FAA certifies an aircraft design, it also certifies the bill of materials, which would include TransDigm's parts. That essentially creates switching costs for aerospace manufacturers that are less likely to make changes in the design for years. Ultimately, TransDigm's business has soared along with a booming aerospace industry, but part of the reason its growth has been such on a blistering pace is its acquisition-heavy strategy and leveraged balance sheet. That makes TransDigm risky, but if it continues to do business as well as it has historically, the company is poised to reward long-term investors. No more messing around Tim Green: The retail industry is going to look a lot different 10 years from now. E-commerce will continue to steal away sales from traditional retailers, and the weakest operators will struggle to survive. Wal-Mart, the 800-pound gorilla of the brick-and-mortar retail business, aims to not only survive, but thrive. The company is going all-in on e-commerce, and while this will hurt its results in the near term, it's the only path forward. Wal-Mart is scaling back its plans to open new stores, with just 55 U.S. stores planned for fiscal 2018, down from 230 in fiscal 2016. At the same time, the company is rapidly growing its stable of e-commerce distribution centers and investing in new technology to make its warehouses more efficient. According to Justen Traweek, VP of e-commerce supply chain and fulfillment, Wal-Mart can now ship to the majority of the U.S. population in one day. The $3 billion acquisition of Jet gives another boost to Wal-Mart's e-commerce business, while at the same time giving the company a brand that may prove more appealing to younger consumers. Other initiatives, like ShippingPass, a $49 annual subscription service that provides free two-day shipping and online grocery pickup and delivery, show that Wal-Mart isn't going sit idly by and let Amazon eat its lunch. Wal-Mart may have fallen behind in e-commerce, but that doesn't mean it can't catch up. Image source: Getty Images. Sales of this newly approved drug look ready to explode higher Sean Williams: Call me a bit biased since I've been a shareholder for more than two years, but I'm really excited to see what happens next with biotech Exelixis. There have been two major dynamics at work with Exelixis: the rise of Cabometyx and the recent struggles of one of its biggest competitors. Cabometyx is Exelixis' lead cancer drug. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in April as a treatment for second-line renal cell carcinoma after it delivered the first-ever "trifecta," as management has called it: Cabometyx led to statistically significant improvements in progression-free survival, median overall survival, and overall response rates relative to the placebo. It was a big win for Exelixis after Cabometyx flopped in an advanced prostate cancer study. Here's where things get interesting. Recently, Exelixis announced mid-stage data from the CABOSUN trial, noting that Cabometyx proved to be superior with respect to progression-free survival to the current standard of care, Sutent, in first-line renal cell carcinoma. It's possible a label expansion opportunity could be on the horizon. Exelixis is also benefiting from the suggestion of the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) in the CELESTIAL trial, which is examining Cabometyx as a treatment for advanced liver cancer. The IDMC suggested the phase 3 trial continue as planned, which implies that Cabometyx has a shot of hitting its primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in median overall survival. Top-line data should be out next year. Finally, Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo, a cancer immunotherapy that can seemingly do no wrong, is reeling after Opdivo failed to even come close to hitting its primary endpoint in a first-line non-small cell lung cancer study known as CheckMate-026. The failure of Opdivo, which is the current market share leader in second-line renal cell carcinoma, could open the door for Cabometyx to capitalize in the second-line (and perhaps, down the road, first-line) for this indication. Things are really starting to heat up for Exelixis, and shareholders should rightly be excited. The reason is clear Todd Campbell: Align Technology, Inc. is one of healthcare's fastest-growing companies, and demand for its Invisalign clear orthodontic aligners is showing no signs of slowing. In Q2, Align Technology's year-over-year sales and profit increased by 29% to $269 million and 59% to $0.62 per share, respectively. ALGN Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Invisalign's growth stems from compelling advantages versus traditional metal braces. Since Invisalign is clear, it's less noticeable to others. The aligners can be removed easily, and there aren't any restrictions on the types of food you can eat while wearing Invisalign. Invisalign can be cheaper than traditional metal braces, too. Currently, Invisalign's market share is only 7%, and since next-generation Invisaligns are being designed for use in tougher-to-treat patients, the peak sales opportunity appears big -- especially if Align Technology successfully extends its reach beyond orthodontists to general dentistry. Based on the company's anticipated revenue growth, Align Technology's C-suite thinks bottom-line growth will clock in north of 23% per year over the next five years, so even though shares are up significantly, I think there's still plenty of upside ahead. A strong player in a tough market  Tyler Crowe: Just about every publicly traded commodity is struggling today, even ones we assumed would be very stable markets, like agriculture products and fertilizers. The thing is, the agricultural market is suffering from the same malaise as everyone else: too much capacity brought on to satiate the rapid growth of the Chinese economy with little regard to the possibility that this market would slow down. One product in particular has been hit hard: nitrogen-based fertilizers such as urea. Despite the 10-year decline in prices, Terra Nitrogen Company still looks like a compelling investment.  What separates Terra Nitrogen from the rest is that it is out in front of a major shift in the industry. Its urea and ammonium nitrate manufacturing capacity uses cheap domestic natural gas versus more expensive means, such as the anthracite coal used across much of the Asia Pacific region. So, despite the very low prices for urea today, Terra Nitrogen still has gross margins in the 55%-60% range over the past 12 months. Add in the fact that the company has a very lean operation and no debt and you get a company that throws off loads of cash it can distribute to investors -- it is a master limited partnership -- and generates a whopping 45% return on capital. Any potential investor needs to keep in mind that Terra Nitrogen is a variable-rate master limited partnership, so its payout varies from quarter to quarter based on commodity prices and any maintenance downtime. When you consider that the company can do so well even in a distressed commodity market like today, there's a lot of reasons to think Terra Nitrogen will succeed over the long term.

(Associated Press file) Print Email NerdWallet, special to cleveland.com By NerdWallet, special to cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Email the author on November 05, 2016 at 10:33 AM, updated November 05, 2016 at 10:34 AM comments With huge sales and steep savings at nearly every retailer, Black Friday — the day after Thanksgiving — has long been touted as one of the best times of the year for buying just about anything. But it's not all discounts and deals on the 2016 post-Turkey Day shopping bonanza. Use this guide to determine what you should purchase and what you should skip on Nov. 25 to ensure you're getting only the best bargains. Buy: Previous models of Apple products Traditionally, major retail stores such as Best Buy, Target and Wal-Mart discount Apple products each year on Black Friday, and previous-generation models usually see the most dramatic deals. These offers may include price cuts, free gift cards with purchase or a combination of both. This year, look for deals on MacBooks, iMacs, iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and Apple TVs. Last year, for instance, Target devoted almost an entire page of the bull's-eye retailer's 2015 Black Friday ad to Apple. Shoppers scored a free Target gift card when they bought any iPad Mini, iPad Air or Apple Watch. There was also a 20% discount on all iPods. Skip: Toys Toys are one of the seasonal purchase staples, but you might want to think twice before picking them up on Black Friday. Historically, it's best to wait until closer to Christmas to purchase dolls, action figures and the like. You may run the risk that certain items will sell out, but you may also be able to find bigger savings on what's left. Last year, in the final days before Christmas, toys were on sale at Kmart, Wal-Mart and Big Lots, to name a few. Shoppers bought one toy and got a second toy at 50% off on Monster High dolls and accessories, Fisher-Price preschool toys and Block Tech playsets, as well as activity and science sets. » MORE: Full list of 2016 Black Friday store hours Buy: Gaming system bundles Black Friday is for gamers just as much as it is for shoppers. This year, look for savings on video games and video game systems from retailers such as Best Buy, Target, Wal-Mart and GameStop. You'll find particularly great offers on gaming bundles. Traditionally, these include the game console plus a combination of games and accessories. Last year, video game retailer GameStop took $50 off both the Xbox One 500GB Gears of War Ultimate Bundle and the PlayStation 4 500GB Uncharted Collection Bundle. Skip: Christmas decorations You've likely seen the blowout post-Christmas clearance sales every year on Dec. 26 as you made your way to the store to return that gift that missed the mark. The absolute best time to buy Christmas decorations, wrapping paper, tinsel and other seasonal trimmings is right after Christmas (for obvious reasons). But if you need these items before the holiday, don't buy them on Black Friday. Sure, you'll see plenty of deals on artificial trees and rolls of wrapping paper, especially at home and craft stores, but retailers are more eager to slash prices the closer it gets to Christmas. Buy: Electronics (TVs, tablets and smartphones) Electronics deals are a Black Friday staple, and for many consumers, that means shopping for a new TV, tablet or smartphone. In 2015, Target offered an impressive $249.99 deal on a 55-inch Westinghouse LED TV. Over at Staples, tablets were all the rage. Shoppers could save up to 25% on select iPad models. Staples also dropped the price of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7-inch down to $79.99 (regularly $139.99). No matter where you choose to spend your Black Friday (or your Thanksgiving), you're almost guaranteed to find TV and tablet doorbusters. Another electronics deal to keep an eye out for: smartphones. Verizon offered $100 off the retail price of select Android smartphones last year. » MORE: Black Friday 2016 ad leaks Skip: Bedding You've got the entertainment center covered, but you should hesitate before stocking up on supplies to refresh the look of your bedroom this Black Friday. The lowest prices on bedding and linens have been known to appear in January during what are called "white sales," so hold off until then if you can. January 2016 white sales took place at Macy's, Pottery Barn, Nordstrom and more. Buy: Video games, CDs, DVDs If you're in need of some affordable stocking stuffers, look no further than the video game, CD, DVD and Blu-ray department at most major retailers this Black Friday. You'll find films and gaming titles deeply discounted from their original prices. In 2015, for example, Best Buy offered select Blu-ray titles for $9.99 each and up to 70 CD titles for $6.99 each. Wal-Mart had certain video games for $25 each and a selection of special-buy DVD titles for just $1.96 apiece. Skip: Outdoor essentials You won't see too many grills or patio furniture sets plastered on the front pages of Black Friday ads this year. That's because, not surprisingly, outdoor products and patio furniture are deeply discounted immediately after summer ends. If you didn't pick up these products at the close of this summer, wait until Labor Day sales roll around next year. Can't wait until then? Another viable option is the Spring Black Friday Sale that home improvement store Lowe's usually holds each year. Buy: Home appliances No secret here. Black Friday is well-known for its offers of huge savings on washers, dryers, refrigerators and kitchen appliances. Look for similar deep discounts again this year. Last year at Sears, the Kenmore 4.3-cubic-foot washer and 7.3-cubic-foot dryer were on sale for $799.98 for the pair. That's a 57% discount. Best Buy took $1,500 off the price of a Samsung 28.2-cubic-foot 4-Door French Door Smart Refrigerator, bringing it down to $2,099.99. If you're in the market for smaller appliances such as coffee makers, mixers, blenders or vacuum cleaners, expect deals this year from department stores such as Kohl's, J.C. Penney and Macy's. Skip: Winter clothing Fall and winter clothing generally isn't the best value on Black Friday. Jeans, for instance, see better sales in October, and retailers frequently offer big clearance sales on jackets when winter gives way to spring. Of course, if you need something to keep you warm before then, you'll be able to find some bargains this Black Friday. Year after year, Macy's and J.C. Penney have offered doorbuster deals on women's boots. In the past, select pairs have been just $19.99 each. Buy: Travel deals Whether it's hotel rooms, ski lift tickets or airfare, you can expect big deals on travel this Black Friday and Cyber Monday (Nov. 28). Check for deals from online travel sites like Expedia and major airlines alike. Note: In the past, most of these promotions were available for a very limited time. Skip: Mail-in rebates If you want to avoid some of the hassle related to Black Friday shopping, resist deals that require a mail-in rebate. Unless you're disciplined enough to fill out the form and wait to receive the rebate, you could end up paying more than you intended. And even if you do follow through with rebate, you'll have to shell out a higher price at the register before getting some of your money back. Always read the fine print; some kitchen appliances, electronics and other popular items may require you to fill out a mail-in rebate to achieve the advertised price. At Kohl's, for example, some small kitchen appliances were available for $7.99 last year — but that was after a $12 mail-in rebate. Buy: Online doorbusters Finally, for the ultimate combination of convenience and savings, spring for online doorbusters this year. Plenty of big box retailers are bringing their doorbusters online this Thanksgiving and Black Friday. Office Depot and OfficeMax, for instance, will be closed on Thanksgiving Day 2016, but deals will be available online starting at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time on the holiday.

The world’s largest retailer says it will seek to reduce emissions in its own operations by 18 percent by 2025, and work toward adding no waste to landfills in key markets like Canada and the United States. It also plans to be powered by 50 percent clean and renewable energy sources. Wal-Mart’s goals, being announced Friday by CEO Doug McMillon, follow a plan set in 2005 as the company sought to deflect criticism of its practices and burnish its image. Wal-Mart has extended its effort since then into its supply chain, which because of its size — more than 10,000 stores globally — gives it outsized influence on the overall industry. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer is under pressure from consumers, especially millennials, who want environmentally friendly items. Wal-Mart is looking at technology that will let shoppers scan food to learn its origins and other information, beyond just tagging products with “green labels.” Kathleen McLaughlin, a Wal-Mart senior vice president, said she couldn’t estimate how much the programs will save or cost. While they have an impact on society, they overall also make good business sense, she said. The company will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures and expand its use of clean and renewable sources to reduce emissions in its operations. Wal-Mart says it will be the first retailer to have an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets initiative in partnership with the Paris Climate Agreement in December 2015. It will also work with suppliers to scale back emissions by one gigaton by 2030, which it says is equivalent to taking 211 million cars from the road a year. Wal-Mart says it hopes to be adding zero waste to landfills in Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States by 2025. It plans to refine how it buys food so less of it goes unsold, and any that does is converted to pet food or fertilizers or diverted to charities. The company wants its private-brand packaging to be 100 percent recyclable. It also plans to double sales of locally grown produce by 2025. It’s also working with suppliers and its private-label products to eliminate certified synthetic colors and artificial flavors and get rid of other food additives where possible. The retailer plans to work with industry groups and others to ensure that workers globally in sectors like seafood, produce, clothing and electronics are not forced to pay fees to land jobs and are not taken advantage of by recruiting agents. It plans to train suppliers to monitor whether workers are being exploited. Wal-Mart was among the companies to which an Associated Press probe last year traced seafood that came through a fishing industry that used slave labor. The seafood was also linked to supermarkets and pet suppliers such as Kroger, Whole Foods, and Petco. Diane Regas, executive director at the Environmental Defense Fund, says Wal-Mart deserves credit for more than meeting its sustainability commitment. “I think that surprises people,” Ms. Regas said, but added, “There is a huge amount more to be done.” Wal-Mart Stores Inc - The Kroger Co - Whole Foods Market Inc - Doug McMillon - Canada - United States - North America Sign up for free newsletters and get more of the Post-Gazette delivered to your inbox Most Read Most Emailed Advertisement Most Commented Your e-mail: Your Name: Friends e-mail: Friends Name: Message: Captcha Submit Advertisement Create a free PG account.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Walmart Offers New Vision for the Company’s Role in Society CEO Doug McMillon points to a “new era of trust and transparency” for customers and communities PHILADELPHIA–(BUSINESS WIRE)–At today’s Net Impact Conference, Walmart president and CEO Doug McMillon will outline a roadmap that will guide the company’s role in society on critical issues over the next several years, pointing to a “new era of trust and transparency.” The roadmap adds fresh detail to Walmart’s sustainability agenda and contains new commitments that reflect a wider recognition of the company’s impact on communities and the planet. Among other things, Walmart is doubling sales of locally grown produce in the U.S.; expanding and enhancing sustainable sourcing to cover 20 key commodities, including bananas, coffee and tea; and implementing a new plan designed to achieve science-based targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Walmart is the first retailer with an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement in December 2015. Under the approved plan, Walmart will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures, together with a commitment to source half of the company’s energy needs from renewable sources, to achieve an 18 percent emissions reduction in its own operations by 2025. Additionally, Walmart will work with suppliers to reduce emissions by 1 Gigaton by 2030, equivalent to taking more than 211 million passenger vehicles off of U.S. roads and highways for a year. In his remarks, McMillon will also discuss company programs that will train hundreds of thousands of U.S. associates by the end of next year, providing them with skills needed to move from entry-level positions to jobs with more responsibility and higher pay, along with a new pledge to take a leadership role in promoting ethical recruitment and treatment of workers in the global retail supply chain. Taken together, the initiatives are designed to make good on the company’s desire to become the most trusted retailer, not just by delivering affordable goods and a time-saving shopping experience, but with trust-building transparency and actions. “We want to make sure Walmart is a company that our associates and customers are proud of – and that we are always doing right by them and by the communities they live in,” McMillon said. “That’s really what these commitments are about. And that’s why we’re so passionate about them.” The roadmap builds upon the three environmental sustainability goals Walmart set in 2005: to create zero waste in company operations, to operate with 100 percent renewable energy, and to sell products that sustain natural resources and the environment. Those aspirational goals have guided how Walmart engages on those vital issues and progress has been made toward them. The new roadmap builds on progress to date, but also broadens the company’s vision of its role in society. The commitments shared today include: Power half of the company’s energy from renewable sources under a plan designed to achieve science-based emissions targets: Walmart is one of the largest private-sector investors in renewable energy, including solar and wind power. In 2015, 25 percent of Walmart’s operations were powered by renewable energy, a significant step towards the 2005 goal. Going forward, the company will source half of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2025, as part of a plan designed to achieve science-based targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Walmart is the first retailer with an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement. Under the recently approved plan, Walmart will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures, together with expanded use of renewable energy, to reduce emissions in its own operations by 18 percent by 2025. Additionally, Walmart will work with suppliers to reduce emissions by 1 Gigaton by 2030, equivalent to taking more than 211 million passenger vehicles off of U.S. roads and highways for a year. Achieve zero waste to landfill in key markets by 2025: Progress so far has been significant on the original goal. In 2015, 75 percent of Walmart’s global waste was diverted from landfills, helping to reduce costs to the business, customers and society. Under the roadmap, the company will achieve zero waste to landfill from our own operations in key markets, including the U.S., U.K., Japan, and Canada by 2025. The commitment is designed to meet or exceed EPA zero waste guidelines. Walmart will also continue working to reduce landfill waste in all markets, moving as fast as infrastructure and best practices allow. Sell more sustainably produced products while maintaining the low prices customers expect: Packaging: Walmart pledges to work with suppliers to reduce product and packaging waste and preserve natural resources. Our goal by 2025 is for Walmart’s private brand packaging to be 100 percent recyclable. Affordable, safe and healthier: Walmart will double the sales of locally grown produce in the U.S. by 2025 and work with suppliers and its own private brand products to remove certified synthetic colors and artificial flavors in products where customers don’t expect to find them, as well as reduce sodium, added sugars and saturated fat where possible. Additionally, Walmart will expand and enhance sustainable sourcing to cover 20 key commodities, including bananas, grapes, coffee, and tea. Natural resources: Walmart is expanding sourcing of commodities produced with zero net deforestation. In partnership with governments, NGOs and industry groups, Walmart has previously been working to source private-brand palm oil and beef from Brazil’s Amazon with zero net deforestation. Under the roadmap, Walmart will expand its work into additional critical commodities, including all Brazilian soy and private-brand pulp and paper. McMillon will also discuss the company’s $2.7 billion investment over the past two years in education, wages and training for associates in the U.S. and called for a broader industry push to ensure retailers are seen as employers of choice. “Today we are asking other retailers to join us in helping people live better,” he said. “Let’s use our collective power to create good jobs with good training that become good careers for all our associates.” Walmart will work to achieve the following: Support the human dignity of workers in the retail supply chain: Walmart is joining the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment, a collaboration of businesses and NGO partners working to ensure ethical recruitment and treatment of workers globally. This is on top of Walmart’s work underway in four areas that present risk to the dignity and safety of workers: seafood; apparel; produce; and electronics. Be the place to go for an individual’s first job: Walmart will further its efforts to afford a good experience for the thousands of people who come to the retailer for their first job. Associates will be provided with workplace mobility – a good start, new skills and a clear path to grow and succeed – whether or not they remain with the company. To further these efforts, Walmart has recently signed on to the White House First Jobs Compact, a nationwide effort to help connect out-of-school, out-of-work youth to their first jobs. Provide a clear path for career advancement: By 2025, Walmart U.S. will put millions of associates through focused training programs to equip them with skills to improve career growth, from entry level positions to jobs with more responsibility and higher pay. The retailer’s Pathways program provides training in core skills for entry-level associates and rewards them with a pay increase upon completion. The Academy training program – for supervisory associates – is expected to graduate 250,000 people alone by the end of 2017. As part of this commitment, Walmart strives to be a destination employer for young people and returning service members. Predictability, stability and pay: Walmart is committed to improving predictability in the lives of its associates by providing work schedules more than two weeks in advance in the U.S.; as well as implementing a strong leave policy that empowers associates to decide how to use their paid time off based on individual needs. Walmart also believes in equal pay for equal work. Associates with the same qualifications, performing the same jobs and making the same effort to achieve the same results, should receive the same pay. Improve the lives of people in communities: Walmart will source more products locally around the world, including $250 billion in products supporting American jobs by 2023 and $20 billion in products from women-owned businesses in the U.S. by the end of this year. The retailer also committed to donating 4 billion meals to fight hunger by 2020 and, over five years, to contributing $25 million towards disaster relief and resiliency around the world.

So have employees of utilities and telecom firms. Finally, after years of stagnant pay, more American workers are receiving meaningful raises a trend driven home by the government's October jobs report. Average hourly pay surged 10 cents an hour last month to an average of $25.92, the government reported Friday. That's 2.8 percent higher than it was a year ago, the sharpest 12-month increase since 2009. The job market appears much healthier now, a sign that the plodding seven-year recovery is now providing some critical relief for workers. ___ Wal-Mart sets environmental plan as people seek green items NEW YORK Wal-Mart is laying out its environmental map for the next several years as it tries to satisfy customers who want green products at affordable prices. The world's largest retailer says it will seek to reduce emissions in its own operations by 18 percent by 2025, and work toward adding no waste to landfills in key markets like Canada and the United States. It also plans to be powered by 50 percent clean and renewable energy sources. Wal-Mart's goals, announced Friday by CEO Doug McMillon, follow a plan set in 2005 as the company sought to deflect criticism of its practices and burnish its image. ___ S&P 500 index marks its longest losing streak in 36 years NEW YORK The slow, steady retreat of the stock market ahead of the 2016 election continued Friday, with the market falling for a ninth straight day. Wall Street is now in its longest period of decline in more than three decades. Investors continue to focus on the U.S. presidential election, which has become too close for comfort for some investors and has put the market on the defensive. The last time the S&P 500 fell for nine straight days is December 1980, nearly 36 years ago. Ronald Reagan wasn't even president yet. ___ US trade deficit in September at lowest level in 19 months WASHINGTON The U.S. trade deficit fell in September to the lowest level in 19 months as demand for U.S.-made airplanes and other exports increased while imports slipped. The politically sensitive deficit with China declined. The deficit narrowed to $36.4 billion in September, down 9.9 percent from August, the Commerce Department said Friday. It was the lowest imbalance since February 2015. The latest report offers American manufacturers an encouraging sign that the problems caused by overseas weakness and a rising dollar were beginning to wane. ___ Samsung, after phone recall, recalls 3M washing machines Nearly 3 million Samsung washing machines are being recalled in the U.S. following multiple injuries including a broken jaw due to "excessive vibration." Samsung is the South Korean company that last month was forced to recall millions of its of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones after batteries inside began to overheat and catch fire. Safety officials cited 733 reports of malfunctioning, top-loading washing machines and nine injuries, including the broken jaw and an injured shoulder. The recall Friday affects 34 models of washing machines manufactured between 2011 and this year. ___ Buffett's firm's 3Q profit drops 24 pct on investments value OMAHA, Neb. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. reported a 24 percent drop in third-quarter profit on Friday because last year's results were helped by a huge paper gain on the value of its Kraft Heinz Food Co. stake. The conglomerate billionaire Warren Buffett leads posted solid results at most of the more than 90 companies it owns as it reported net income of $7.2 billion, or $4,379 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's down from $9.43 billion, or $5,737 per A share, a year ago when it recorded a $4.4 billion after-tax gain after Kraft and Heinz merged. ___ Icahn takes an even larger stake in Herbalife NEW YORK Billionaire Carl Icahn is extending a years-long proxy fight with co-billionaire Bill Ackman, upping his stake in Herbalife yet again. The two have been battling over the legitimacy of the supplements and weight loss company since 2012, when Ackman called Herbalife a pyramid scheme and revealed a massive bet against it. A regulatory filing this week shows that Icahn upped the stakes again, pushing his ownership from 20.8 percent, up to 23.1 percent. He's the California company's biggest stakeholder. At $54.70 per share, Icahn put another $100 million plus into Herbalife on Thursday. ___ EU Commission holds up DuPont-Dow merger review WASHINGTON The EU Commission reviewing the proposed merger of agriculture and chemicals companies DuPont Co. and Dow Chemical has put its work on hold as it waits for more information from the companies. The commission in August had expressed concern it could harm competition in the crop protection, seeds and petrochemicals sectors. DuPont and Dow agreed to merge in December in an all-stock deal then valued at about $62 billion. Shareholders for DuPont and Dow approved the merger in July. A Dow spokesperson said the Midland, Michigan company expects the merger to be completed in the first quarter of 2017, pending regulatory approvals. ___ UK's May seeks to keep Brexit plan going despite setback LONDON British Prime Minister Theresa May sought Friday to reassure European Union leaders that her timetable for Britain to leave the EU remains intact despite a court ruling requiring British lawmakers to have more of a say in the process. She telephoned Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU's top official, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to say her plan is still to start the process to remove Britain from the EU by the end of March. Officials say she will also call French President Francois Hollande and European Council President Donald Tusk. In Berlin, British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson said the court ruling should not interfere with the government's Brexit timetable. ___ Egypt devalues, floats its currency, meeting key IMF demand CAIRO Egypt on Thursday took the unprecedented step of floating its currency and later hiked fuel prices, meeting key demands by the International Monetary Fund under a $12 billion loan agreement to overhaul the ailing economy of the most populous Arab state. The floatation, accompanied by a 48 percent devaluation of the Egyptian pound, is the boldest economic measure taken by President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi since his election in 2014. El-Sissi has often asserted that tough times lie ahead as the country struggles with an array of economic woes, from double-digit inflation to unemployment and an acute foreign currency shortage. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 42.39 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,888.28. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 3.48 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,085.18. The Nasdaq composite lost 12.04 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,046.37. Benchmark U.S. crude oil lost 59 cents to $44.07 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, declined 77 cents to $45.58 a barrel in London. Heating oil fell 3 cents to $1.43 a gallon, wholesale gasoline fell 4.5 cents to $1.38 a gallon and natural gas futures fell less than 1 cent to $2.767 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Zachary McClimans, 22, of Sharon, said he had reported the issue to management at the Hermitage store last week but 'no decision had been made' regarding the other employee, police said in a criminal complaint on Friday. McClimans decided one 'solution' to prevent his co-worker, identified as Jayson Hall, from harming him was shooting him, according to court documents. Scroll down for video  Walmart shooting suspect Zachary McClimans, 22, (left and right) said he opened fire on his co-worker because the employee was offended he was changing genders to female and had threatened him, police said McClimans shot his coworker, identified as Jayson Hall, with his grandfather's .380-caliber pistol inside the store in Hermitage, Pennsylvania on Thursday at about 10.30pm. People stand outside the store following the shooting So McClimans took his grandfather's .380-caliber pistol, drove to the store and shot Hall inside at about 10.30pm on Thursday, police said. McClimans, who had left during his shift earlier in the day before returning to the store later that night, had originally planned to shoot the Hall outside the store. However, 'he felt so strongly about shooting Hall that he could not wait, at which time he tracked down Hall inside the store,' according to the complaint. Hall - who was found in a back stockroom - was shot four times, including twice in the back, according to authorities. Chaotic scenes followed inside the store as frantic customers and Walmart employees were seen fleeing, WKBN reported. When officers arrived, witnesses told police the shooter was still at the store in the parking lot. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Number of gay characters on network TV hits record high -...

Share this article Share Chaotic scenes ensued following the shooting as frantic customers and Walmart employees were seen fleeing from the store Hall - who was found in a back stockroom - was shot four times, including twice in the back, according to authorities. He was taken to a local hospital where he is listed in stable condition Officers then approached the vehicle where McClimans was sitting inside, who had a gun with him that was taken into evidence. He surrendered to police and was arrested at the scene, according to the station.  Hall was taken to St. Elizabeth Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio, where he is listed in stable condition. He is expected to recover, Hermitage police said. While McClimans told police he is switching genders, it was not known if he has begun identifying as female. Police checked the box marked 'male' on the criminal complaint and did not list any feminine aliases for McClimans. The Walmart store in Hermitage, about 70 miles north of Pittsburgh, closed overnight Thursday following the shooting and reopened on Friday morning. Store employees would not comment, but Walmart spokesman Charles Crowson confirmed in an email that one worker was injured and said one worker was fired. 'Our thoughts are with the associate who was injured. The other associate involved has been terminated,' Crowson said.  'We're continuing to gather all of the facts and work closely with law enforcement.' Following the shooting, officers at the scene located him inside a vehicle in the parking lot. He surrendered and was taken into custody McClimans has been charged with attempted murder, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, theft and carrying a firearm without a license Walmart said police would have to answer any questions about McCliman's allegation of harassment at the store. The victim named in the criminal complaint is not charged with a crime and could not immediately be reached to respond to McClimans' accusations against him. Police did not return calls seeking additional information about Hall or other aspects of the shooting. McClimans has been charged with attempted murder, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, theft and carrying a firearm without a license, WTAE reported. An attorney for him was not listed in court documents. Phone calls to several of his relatives went unanswered, except for one man who refused to give his name and declined to comment.

It also plans to be powered by 50 percent clean and renewable energy sources. JOE RAEDLE , GETTY IMAGES The world’s largest retailer says it will seek to reduce emissions in its own operations by 18 percent by 2025, and work toward adding no waste to landfills in key markets like Canada and the United States. It also plans to be powered by 50 percent clean and renewable energy sources. JOE RAEDLE , GETTY IMAGES By ANNE D’INNOCENZIO / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Wal-Mart is laying out its environmental map for the next several years as it tries to satisfy customers who want green products at affordable prices. The world’s largest retailer says it will seek to reduce emissions in its own operations by 18 percent by 2025, and work toward adding no waste to landfills in key markets like Canada and the United States. It also plans to be powered by 50 percent clean and renewable energy sources. Wal-Mart’s goals, being announced Friday by CEO Doug McMillon, follow a plan set in 2005 as the company sought to deflect criticism of its practices and burnish its image. Wal-Mart has extended its effort since then into its supply chain, where the company’s size – more than 10,000 stores globally – gives it outsized influence on the overall industry. The retailer is under pressure from consumers, especially millennials, who want environmentally friendly items. Wal-Mart is looking at technology that will let shoppers scan food to learn its origins and other information, beyond just tagging products with “green labels.” Kathleen McLaughlin, a Wal-Mart senior vice president, said she couldn’t estimate how much the programs will save or cost. While they have an impact on society, they overall also make good business sense, she said. Some areas of focus: SUSTAINABILITY The company will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures and expand its use of clean and renewable sources to reduce emissions in its operations. Wal-Mart says it will be the first retailer to have an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets initiative in partnership with the Paris Climate Agreement in December 2015. The Science Based Targets initiative is a partnership with World Wildlife Fund, World Resources Institute and others. Wal-Mart says it hopes to add zero waste to landfills in Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and the U.S. by 2025. It plans to refine how it buys food so less of it goes unsold, and any that does is converted to pet food or fertilizers or diverted to charities. PRODUCTS The company wants its private-brand packaging to be 100 percent recyclable. It also plans to double sales of locally grown produce by 2025. It’s also working with suppliers and its private-label products to eliminate certified synthetic colors and artificial flavors and get rid of other food additives where possible. WORKERS Wal-Mart plans to work with industry groups and others to ensure that workers globally in sectors like seafood, produce, clothing and electronics are not forced to pay fees to land jobs and are not taken advantage of by recruiting agents. It plans to train suppliers to monitor whether workers are being exploited. Wal-Mart was among the companies to which an Associated Press probe last year traced seafood that came through a fishing industry that used slave labor. The seafood was also linked to supermarkets and pet suppliers such as Kroger, Whole Foods and Petco. Diane Regas, executive director at the Environmental Defense Fund, says Wal-Mart deserves credit for more than meeting its sustainability commitment. “I think that surprises people,” Regas said, but added, “There is a huge amount more to be done.” Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off Most Popular Missing teen last seen at Disney hotel where she was staying with family U.S. Marine dies in Lake Forest motorcycle crash Body of missing Huntington Beach scuba diver found off El Segundo Stater Bros. leader Jack Brown dies at 78 21-year-old woman dies after stabbing in Anaheim User Agreement Comments are encouraged, but you must follow our Privacy Policy Policy & Terms of Use Keep it civil and stay on topic.

So have employees of utilities and telecom firms. Finally, after years of stagnant pay, more American workers are receiving meaningful raises — a trend driven home by the government's October jobs report. Average hourly pay surged 10 cents an hour last month to an average of $25.92, the government reported Friday. That's 2.8 per cent higher than it was a year ago, the sharpest 12-month increase since 2009. The job market appears much healthier now, a sign that the plodding seven-year recovery is now providing some critical relief for workers. ___ Wal-Mart sets environmental plan as people seek green items NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart is laying out its environmental map for the next several years as it tries to satisfy customers who want green products at affordable prices. The world's largest retailer says it will seek to reduce emissions in its own operations by 18 per cent by 2025, and work toward adding no waste to landfills in key markets like Canada and the United States. It also plans to be powered by 50 per cent clean and renewable energy sources. Wal-Mart's goals, announced Friday by CEO Doug McMillon, follow a plan set in 2005 as the company sought to deflect criticism of its practices and burnish its image. ___ S&P 500 index marks its longest losing streak in 36 years NEW YORK (AP) — The slow, steady retreat of the stock market ahead of the 2016 election continued Friday, with the market falling for a ninth straight day. Wall Street is now in its longest period of decline in more than three decades. Investors continue to focus on the U.S. presidential election, which has become too close for comfort for some investors and has put the market on the defensive. The last time the S&P 500 fell for nine straight days is December 1980, nearly 36 years ago. Ronald Reagan wasn't even president yet. ___ US trade deficit in September at lowest level in 19 months WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. trade deficit fell in September to the lowest level in 19 months as demand for U.S.-made airplanes and other exports increased while imports slipped. The politically sensitive deficit with China declined. The deficit narrowed to $36.4 billion in September, down 9.9 per cent from August, the Commerce Department said Friday. It was the lowest imbalance since February 2015. The latest report offers American manufacturers an encouraging sign that the problems caused by overseas weakness and a rising dollar were beginning to wane. ___ Samsung, after phone recall, recalls 3M washing machines Nearly 3 million Samsung washing machines are being recalled in the U.S. following multiple injuries — including a broken jaw — due to "excessive vibration." Samsung is the South Korean company that last month was forced to recall millions of its of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones after batteries inside began to overheat and catch fire. Safety officials cited 733 reports of malfunctioning, top-loading washing machines and nine injuries, including the broken jaw and an injured shoulder. The recall Friday affects 34 models of washing machines manufactured between 2011 and this year. ___ Buffett's firm's 3Q profit drops 24 pct on investments value OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Berkshire Hathaway Inc. reported a 24 per cent drop in third-quarter profit on Friday because last year's results were helped by a huge paper gain on the value of its Kraft Heinz Food Co. stake. The conglomerate billionaire Warren Buffett leads posted solid results at most of the more than 90 companies it owns as it reported net income of $7.2 billion, or $4,379 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's down from $9.43 billion, or $5,737 per A share, a year ago when it recorded a $4.4 billion after-tax gain after Kraft and Heinz merged. ___ Icahn takes an even larger stake in Herbalife NEW YORK (AP) — Billionaire Carl Icahn is extending a years-long proxy fight with co-billionaire Bill Ackman, upping his stake in Herbalife yet again. The two have been battling over the legitimacy of the supplements and weight loss company since 2012, when Ackman called Herbalife a pyramid scheme and revealed a massive bet against it. A regulatory filing this week shows that Icahn upped the stakes again, pushing his ownership from 20.8 per cent, up to 23.1 per cent. He's the California company's biggest stakeholder. At $54.70 per share, Icahn put another $100 million plus into Herbalife on Thursday. ___ EU Commission holds up DuPont-Dow merger review WASHINGTON (AP) — The EU Commission reviewing the proposed merger of agriculture and chemicals companies DuPont Co. and Dow Chemical has put its work on hold as it waits for more information from the companies. The commission in August had expressed concern it could harm competition in the crop protection, seeds and petrochemicals sectors. DuPont and Dow agreed to merge in December in an all-stock deal then valued at about $62 billion. Shareholders for DuPont and Dow approved the merger in July. A Dow spokesperson said the Midland, Michigan company expects the merger to be completed in the first quarter of 2017, pending regulatory approvals. ___ UK's May seeks to keep Brexit plan going despite setback LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Theresa May sought Friday to reassure European Union leaders that her timetable for Britain to leave the EU remains intact despite a court ruling requiring British lawmakers to have more of a say in the process. She telephoned Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU's top official, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to say her plan is still to start the process to remove Britain from the EU by the end of March. Officials say she will also call French President Francois Hollande and European Council President Donald Tusk. In Berlin, British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson said the court ruling should not interfere with the government's Brexit timetable. ___ Egypt devalues, floats its currency, meeting key IMF demand CAIRO (AP) — Egypt on Thursday took the unprecedented step of floating its currency and later hiked fuel prices, meeting key demands by the International Monetary Fund under a $12 billion loan agreement to overhaul the ailing economy of the most populous Arab state. The floatation, accompanied by a 48 per cent devaluation of the Egyptian pound, is the boldest economic measure taken by President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi since his election in 2014. El-Sissi has often asserted that tough times lie ahead as the country struggles with an array of economic woes, from double-digit inflation to unemployment and an acute foreign currency shortage. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 42.39 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 17,888.28. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 3.48 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 2,085.18. The Nasdaq composite lost 12.04 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 5,046.37. Benchmark U.S. crude oil lost 59 cents to $44.07 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, declined 77 cents to $45.58 a barrel in London. Heating oil fell 3 cents to $1.43 a gallon, wholesale gasoline fell 4.5 cents to $1.38 a gallon and natural gas futures fell less than 1 cent to $2.767 per 1,000 cubic feet.       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *     Related Topics   business The Associated Press The Canadian Press         Business Videos         Most Popular canada.com E-mailed Shared     Sponsored By           FP Business Wire »   FP Business Wire   Freetech Officially Signed a Strategic Cooperation Agreement With Chongqing Jiaotong University Post-Show Report Manufacturing World Osaka 2016 Concluded in a Huge Success!

The Mansfield man went inside the store and returned after purchasing 10 pillows for individuals who use the shelter. "I heard it on the radio this morning and you hear so much good stuff about Harmony House and I'm always thinking go do it, and I finally decided to get off my butt and do something," he said. The fundraiser benefits Harmony House at 124 W. Third St. Mansfield, which last year served  578 people. Last year Harmony House provided 14,416 nights of lodging,  43,272 meals and provided comprehensive case management to 578 people. In addition to shelter, the agency provides food and clothing, case management, workshops, after-school and summer programs for children, rent and deposit assistance, household items and furniture as available and six units of permanent housing. Friday, the 24-hour fundraiser kicked off right on time as volunteers set up their cardboard boxes for the sleep-out, in its 22nd year. Vicki Kane, executive director of Harmony House, said anything someone needs to survive is appreciated — pillows, blankets, personal care items and food. "We really appreciate it," she said. "Our clients have nothing. We supply everything, but we need the community's support because homelessness is a community problem," Kane said. Wayne and Pat Bell, who have volunteered at Harmony House for about 25 years, were at the sleep-out. Pat Bell said Harmony House gives people a safe, warm place they can live, to get them back on their feet. "We need toilet paper and towels and everybody gets a clean towel when they come and when they leave they take it with them, so we always need towels," she said. Kane said Boy Scout Troop 113 helps at the fundraiser each year, and the troop spends the night. Darla Schiro, an employee of Woodforest Bank located inside Walmart on O'Possum Run Road, came to volunteer. She said employees are taking turns and covering the entire 24-hour fundraiser. Kane, a licensed social worker who has spent 27 years working at the shelter, said that while growing up in Detroit, she spent some time living on the streets. She said many community leaders have slept out in past years, including former Mansfield Mayor Lydia Reid and Doc Stumbo, community organizer who works at Graham Automall.

Friday, November 4, 2016  |  Charlie Butts (OneNewsNow.com) A national anti-pornography group is waiting for an answer from a major corporation on how it will handle racy magazines. The National Center on Sexual Exploitation is concerned about Cosmopolitan magazine and the way Walmart stores handle it. Spokesperson Haley Halverson explains why. “For those who don't know Cosmo magazine, on the front it might just look like another woman's magazine - but inside it has a large number of very explicit sexual images and, more importantly, instructions on different sexual acts. So it's actually a very explicit magazine,” she says. Some stores actually have the magazine at checkout stands. In 2015, the Center received an agreement from Walmart regarding the magazine. Halverson “Walmart said that it would shield it in the checkout aisles, but they have not been enforcing this policy standard - and we hear reports from all over the country that Wamart's not doing it,” she says. “So now we're asking that they just stop selling the magazine altogether."  The National Center on Sexual Exploitation has communicated with Walmart but is still waiting for a response. The huge retailer previously agreed to remove a couple of controversial items from its website - one a book of photos that included nude minors, and another book on how to traffic women.

(Sarah MacMillan/CBC) Related Stories Stratford man arrested in connection to Walmart evacuation Charlottetown Walmart reopened after evacuation A man who caused the evacuation of the Charlottetown Walmart was sentenced Friday to 60 days in jail and ordered to pay the store almost $90,000. On the afternoon of Aug. 2, Charlottetown police got a call from someone who said there was a bomb inside the store. Court heard Logan Richard Arsenault, 19, made the bogus threat because he wanted his girlfriend — a Walmart employee — to have the day off. City police traced Arsenault's call to a phone booth in Stratford. Stratford RCMP found surveillance video and talked to staff of a nearby coffee shop, who remembered Arsenault coming in to ask for change to make a phone call. The store had to be closed for about six hours while a bomb squad from the mainland made sure the building was safe. No bomb was found. In addition to 60 days jail and three years probation, Arsenault was ordered to pay $89,100 to Walmart — the cost of wages paid to employees, lost sales and perishable food that had to be thrown out. Court also heard Arsenault and his girlfriend are no longer together. MORE P.E.I. NEWS | Wife of alleged 'screen cutter' pleads not guilty MORE P.E.I.

Check it out below. Tracy Morgan did a television interview on Today in June of last, his first public interview since his deadly car accident last year. Speaking with Matt Lauer alongside his lawyer Benedict Morelli, Morgan spoke out about the June 7, 2014 crash that landed him in a coma and the then-recent settlement with Walmart. On the morning of the accident, a Walmart truck driver caused a multi-vehicle accident involving the comedian and his assistant Jeff Millea, as well as comedians Ardie Fuqua, Harris Stanton and James McNair. James ‘Jimmy Mack’ McNair died as a result. Surprisingly, Tracy Morgan also thanked Walmart for “coming through in the clutch” and taking “full responsibility” for the accident. The sum of the settlement has not been disclosed but the pain remains for the comedian who lost his writing partner and close friend. “The case is settled, but the pain is always going to be there for Jimmy Mack,” Morgan tearfully said as he clutched at his cane. The comedy world suffered a huge blow that day, losing some talented comedians for over a year and losing Jimmy Mack permanently. Fuqua and Morgan have both remained sidelined from the stage for quite some time. But clearly Tracy Morgan is back in a big way. FOLLOW LAUGHSPIN ON TWITTER AND FACEBOOK!

Chase Pay Signals the Next Step of Bank's Walmart Relationship By David Heun November 4, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related How Mobile Banking Is Raising Its Game Customer Experience Is the Tie that Binds Banks and Fintech 'More Sophisticated': Evolution of the Bank-Fintech Dialogue Furthering a relationship that placed Walmart on the closed-loop ChaseNet processing platform, Walmart has committed to accepting the Chase Pay mobile wallet in its stores and in-app. Chase Pay is built on ChaseNet, giving merchants a way to lower their card processing fees when accepting payments from JPMorgan Chase-issued card accounts. It operates by keeping the whole transaction on Chase's network, removing the third parties that are typically involved in open-loop card payments. The agreement also follows Chase's pact with the Merchant Customer Exchange joint venture of which Walmart was a key player, setting the stage for Chase Pay to come to several MCX merchants such as Best Buy. Chase's pitch was hard for merchants to ignore, offering an arrangement with no network fees, no merchant-acquiring fees and no fraud chargebacks on any transaction that Chase approved. Walmart is also working to expand its own Walmart Pay app by joining the list of retailers that accept Chase Pay as a funding source in-app. "We are excited about the opportunity to provide our customers with even greater convenience and value to our Walmart Pay app while expanding our relationship with Chase," Mike Cook, senior vice president and assistant treasurer at Walmart, stated in a Nov. 3 press release. "Adding Chase Pay as an option with Walmart Pay and online will create an enhanced experience for our customers." In addition to what had become an obvious eventuality in Walmart bringing Chase Pay into its fold because of the processing deal, the two mobile payment apps operate on similar technology through the use of QR codes and scanners. That should make it easier for Walmart customers to initiate transactions through either app at the point of sale. While Walmart continues to engage in legal and competitive skirmishes with Visa, the move to Chase Pay gives Walmart stronger footing at the negotiating table in that it provides the one thing Walmart has long desired: cheaper Visa payments.

Kessler in Fort Worth 04 November 2016 Updated 04 November 2016 Share: Facebook Twitter LinkedIn E-mail × E-mail this to a friend. Hey, I saw this on Recharge and thought it might be interesting for you. Cancel Send It! Print Walmart, the world’s largest company by sales, today set a goal to power half of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2025, double the 25% achieved last year. Given the scope of its operations and massive energy usage, the new firm target represents a benchmark for other companies to match or exceed, and continues Walmart’s leadership in the C&I sector for carbon reduction. It aspires to reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions 18% by 2025. The move is also a significant step by Walmart for achieving its 2005 target of powering all its sprawling global operations with renewable energy. Walmart will now accelerate development of mainly onsite solar power and procurement of offsite solar and wind energy, to both meet the new goal and help reduce emissions. In 2015, Walmart ranked as the leading commercial solar energy user and the largest on-site renewable energy consumer in the US, with more than 340 solar installations there. By 2020, it hopes to increase this to more than 480. Last year, it also entered into a 10-year off-take deal to purchase 58% of power from the 200Mw Logan’s Gap wind farm in Texas owned by Pattern Energy. More such large-scale deals are likely in the next several years if wind power prices remain competitive. On 1 January, the retailing giant had more than 470 onsite and offsite renewable energy projects in operation or under development in seven countries and 17 US states.    To help achieve the 2025 goals, Walmart left unchanged an interim target of producing or procuring 7 billion/kWh of renewable energy by the end of 2020, versus more than 2 billion/kWh at the end of 2015. In Mexico, one of Walmart’s largest foreign operations, the company last year already met 60% of its electricity needs with renewable sources. The subsidiary’s goal is to procure 3 billion/kWh of renewable power by 2020.   Asia-Pacific Europe Americas Read Next: Are US corporations the next renewable growth engine?

Reuben Long Detention Center) Dominick Tooker (Source: J. Reuben Long Detention Center) MYRTLE BEACH, SC (WMBF) – Two men have been arrested after they broke into RVs at a campground in Myrtle Beach Oct. 31 and Nov. 1, fought with security, and fled to Walmart on foot. According to a police report, Zachary Todd, 24, of Murrells Inlet, was charged with shoplifting under $2,000, third-degree assault and battery, second-degree violent burglary and malicious injury to animals or personal property worth between $2,000 and $10,000. Dominick Tooker, 22, of Myrtle Beach, was charged with second-degree violent burglary and malicious injury to animals or personal property worth between $2,000 and $10,000. Officers responded to a trespassing call at Walmart on Maryport Drive Nov. 1. There, Todd was fighting with Ocean Lakes Campground security guards. The security guards said they chased Todd and Tooker after a campground maintenance employee had discovered the men hiding under an RV and confronted them. Inside Walmart, Todd ditched a Bluetooth speaker in the bathroom. Officers found a backpack full of children’s clothing, a Nintendo Wii with accessories and two Vizio TV remotes at the campsite. Outside Walmart, Todd punched one of the security guards in the head before they physically restrained him. Officers then took Todd and Tooker into investigative custody. It was discovered that Todd had local warrants and he and Tooker were taken to J. Reuben Long Detention Center. Back at the campgrounds, officers found several RVs had been broken into and there was a shopping cart containing TVs and other stolen property. Copyright 2016 WMBF News. All rights reserved.

The country’s biggest retailer is ramping up its environmental goals, noting that the plan is part of a “new era of trust and transparency.” The vow, which will be delivered by chief executive Doug McMillon today at the environmentally focused Net Impact Conference in Philadelphia, includes doubling sales of locally grown produce and supporting the “human dignity of workers in the retail supply chain.” The green-focused goals come amid a changing consumer landscape, with the millennial generation now outranking baby boomers in numbers and projected to move into their prime spending years. Millennials are also considered more likely to pony up for environmentally sustainable products, while members of Generation Z -- the demographic that’s younger than 20 -- are willing to pay more to shop at companies that are committed to helping social and environmental causes, Nielsen found in a 2015 survey. Play Video CBS This Morning What does the "natural" food label really mean? A Consumer Reports survey found more than 60 percent of Americans buy products labeled "natural," but nearly two-thirds believe natural means mor... “We have done a lot of work with our key customer target, millennials and busy families, and these issues are growing in importance with those customers,” Laura Phillips, senior vice president of Walmart Sustainability, told CBS MoneyWatch. “When we started the work [about a decade ago], we were maybe a little bit ahead of consumers, and they are pushing and pulling now.” It’s no coincidence that the goals are coming at a time when Walmart is seeking to rebuild shopper trust -- and reinvigorate its sales growth -- after complaints about empty stores shelves and poor customer service and even working conditions.  Under McMillon, the company has raised wages for more than a million workers and invested $2.7 billion during the last two years on training, education and higher pay. Still, Walmart has struggled to buck its reputation as a low-wage employer providing few opportunities for advancement. At employment site Glassdoor, the retailer’s rating has slowly improved during the past year, reaching a rating of 3.2, although that’s lower than rival Target’s 3.4 rating among its employees. Walmart wants to revamp how potential hires think about it, with the company noting that its vows include being “the place to go for an individual’s first job” and “provide a clear path for career advancement.” The company said it will train millions of workers to improve their career growth by 2025. It also said it will provide work schedules at least two weeks in advance so that employees will have more predictability in their lives, and will put in place a “strong leave policy” that allows workers to decide how to use their paid time off. As for the green goals, the company said it will source more products locally, including produce, with the goal of doubling its sales of locally grown vegetables and fruits by 2025. It said it will also work with suppliers and its own private-brand products to get rid of synthetic colors and artificial flavors “in products where customers don’t expect to find them.” Play Video CBSN One million Walmart workers are getting a raise CBSN Business Headlines: Walmart raises their minimum wage, Spotify may have been hacked, and Shake Shack innovator wants to give airplane food a... Its energy goals include relying on renewable sources for half of its energy needs by 2025, with Walmart saying that it’s the first retailer with an emissions-reduction plan that has been approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, a group created by nonprofits and agencies such as the U.N. Global Compact and the World Wildlife Fund to work with businesses on climate-change issues. So is Walmart walking the walk, or just talking the talk? After all, “greenwashing” -- or misleading consumers about a product or service’s environmental friendliness -- isn’t uncommon. But big-box retailers are likely a better choice, since they tend to be scrutinized closely by the public and have stronger control of their supply chain, according to a study from consulting firm TerraChoice.  “We want to make sure Walmart is a company that our associates and customers are proud of - and that we are always doing right by them and by the communities they live in,” McMillon said in a statement. “That’s really what these commitments are about. And that’s why we’re so passionate about them.” © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.

(WKBN) – The man who police say opened fire on an employee at the Wal-Mart on Hermitage Road was arraigned in Mercer County Court Friday. Zachary Thomas McClimans, 22, of Sharon, is charged with two counts of attempted murder and aggravated assault, theft, having a firearm without a license and reckless engagement, in the shooting of an employee inside the store Thursday night. His bond was set at $500,000. Police say McClimans quit his job at the store earlier in the day and came back at about 10:30 that night and shot the employee four times. According to a police report, McClimans was transitioning gender and told his co-workers about it. He says the victim, identified as Jayson Hall, became enraged and threatened him. Wal-Mart was investigating the threat, but McClimans said no action had been taken so he stole a gun from his grandfather and shot the co-worker, according to the report. When officers arrived, they found Hall with four gunshot wounds inside the store. Customers and employees told police the shooter was still at the store, directing them to the parking lot. “Numerous people were directing officers to a vehicle in the parking lot. They were indicting that the shooter was in one of the vehicles,” said Hermitage Police Chief Eric Jewell. Officers approached the vehicle and found McClimans sitting inside, according to Jewell. Police say he had a gun with him and it was taken into evidence. McClimans was arrested at the scene, where he surrendered to police.

BUSINESS Wal-Mart sets environmental plan as people seek green items Wal-Mart sign AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File This 2013 file photo shows a Wal-Mart store in San Jose, Calif. This 2013 file photo shows a Wal-Mart store in San Jose, Calif. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) Associated Press Wal-Mart is laying out its environmental map for the next several years as it tries to satisfy customers who want green products at affordable prices.  The world's largest retailer says it will seek to reduce emissions in its own operations by 18% by 2025, and work toward adding no waste to landfills in key markets such as Canada and the United States. It also plans to be powered by 50% clean and renewable energy sources.  Wal-Mart's goals, being announced Friday by CEO Doug McMillon, follow a plan set in 2005 as the company sought to deflect criticism of its practices and burnish its image. Wal-Mart has extended its effort since then into its supply chain, which, because of its size — more than 10,000 stores globally — gives it outsized influence on the overall industry.  The Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer is under pressure from consumers, especially millennials, who want environmentally friendly items. Wal-Mart is looking at technology that will let shoppers scan food to learn its origins and other information, beyond just tagging products with “green labels.”  SIGN UP for the free California Inc. business newsletter » Kathleen McLaughlin, a Wal-Mart senior vice president, said she couldn't estimate how much the programs will save or cost. While they have an impact on society, they also make good business sense overall, she said.  Some areas of focus include:  Sustainability The company will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures and expand its use of clean and renewable sources to reduce emissions in its operations. Wal-Mart says it will be the first retailer to have an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets initiative in partnership with the Paris Climate Agreement in December 2015. The Science Based Targets initiative is a partnership with World Wildlife Fund, World Resources Institute and others. Wal-Mart also will work with suppliers to scale back emissions by one gigaton by 2030, which it says is equivalent to taking 211 million cars from the road a year.  Wal-Mart says it hopes to be adding zero waste to landfills in Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States by 2025. It plans to refine how it buys food so less of it goes unsold, and any that does is converted to pet food or fertilizers or diverted to charities.  Products The company wants its private-brand packaging to be 100% recyclable. It also plans to double sales of locally grown produce by 2025. It's also working with suppliers and its private-label products to eliminate certified synthetic colors and artificial flavors and get rid of other food additives where possible.  Workers Wal-Mart plans to work with industry groups and others to ensure that workers globally in sectors like seafood, produce, clothing and electronics are not forced to pay fees to land jobs and are not taken advantage of by recruiting agents. It plans to train suppliers to monitor whether workers are being exploited.  Wal-Mart was among the companies to which an Associated Press probe last year traced seafood that came through a fishing industry that used slave labor. The seafood also was linked to supermarkets and pet suppliers such as Kroger, Whole Foods and Petco.  Diane Regas, executive director at the Environmental Defense Fund, says Wal-Mart deserves credit for more than meeting its sustainability commitment. “I think that surprises people,” Regas said, but added, “There is a huge amount more to be done.”  Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Trump names Priebus and Bannon as top aides, California National Guard interpreters say they're owed bonuses, UC and Cal State are considering their first tuition hikes in 6 years, and L.A.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Walmart Offers New Vision for the Company’s Role in Society Walmart Offers New Vision for the Company’s Role in Society Posted on November 4, 2016 by CSRwire Press Releases, Events and Reports in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer At today’s Net Impact Conference, Walmart president and CEO Doug McMillon will outline a roadmap that will guide the company’s role in society on critical issues over the next several years, pointing to a “new era of trust and transparency.” The roadmap adds fresh detail to Walmart’s sustainability agenda and contains new commitments that reflect a wider recognition of the company’s impact on communities and the planet. Among other things, Walmart is doubling sales of locally grown produce in the U.S.; expanding and enhancing sustainable sourcing to cover 20 key commodities, including bananas, coffee and tea; and implementing a new plan designed to achieve science-based targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Walmart is the first retailer with an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement in December 2015. Under the approved plan, Walmart will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures, together with a commitment to source half of the company’s energy needs from renewable sources, to achieve an 18 percent emissions reduction in its own operations by 2025. Additionally, Walmart will work with suppliers to reduce emissions by 1 Gigaton by 2030, equivalent to taking more than 211 million passenger vehicles off of U.S. roads and highways for a year. In his remarks, McMillon will also discuss company programs that will train hundreds of thousands of U.S. associates by the end of next year, providing them with skills needed to move from entry-level positions to jobs with more responsibility and higher pay, along with a new pledge to take a leadership role in promoting ethical recruitment and treatment of workers in the global retail supply chain. Taken together, the initiatives are designed to make good on the company’s desire to become the most trusted retailer, not just by delivering affordable goods and a time-saving shopping experience, but with trust-building transparency and actions. “We want to make sure Walmart is a company that our associates and customers are proud of – and that we are always doing right by them and by the communities they live in,” McMillon said. “That’s really what these commitments are about. And that’s why we’re so passionate about them.” The roadmap builds upon the three environmental sustainability goals Walmart set in 2005: to create zero waste in company operations, to operate with 100 percent renewable energy, and to sell products that sustain natural resources and the environment. Those aspirational goals have guided how Walmart engages on those vital issues and progress has been made toward them. The new roadmap builds on progress to date, but also broadens the company’s vision of its role in society. The commitments shared today include: Power half of the company’s energy from renewable sources under a plan designed to achieve science-based emissions targets: Walmart is one of the largest private-sector investors in renewable energy, including solar and wind power. In 2015, 25 percent of Walmart’s operations were powered by renewable energy, a significant step towards the 2005 goal. Going forward, the company will source half of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2025, as part of a plan designed to achieve science-based targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Walmart is the first retailer with an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement. Under the recently approved plan, Walmart will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures, together with expanded use of renewable energy, to reduce emissions in its own operations by 18 percent by 2025. Additionally, Walmart will work with suppliers to reduce emissions by 1 Gigaton by 2030, equivalent to taking more than 211 million passenger vehicles off of U.S. roads and highways for a year. Achieve zero waste to landfill in key markets by 2025: Progress so far has been significant on the original goal. In 2015, 75 percent of Walmart’s global waste was diverted from landfills, helping to reduce costs to the business, customers and society. Under the roadmap, the company will achieve zero waste to landfill from our own operations in key markets, including the U.S., U.K., Japan, and Canada by 2025. The commitment is designed to meet or exceed EPA zero waste guidelines. Walmart will also continue working to reduce landfill waste in all markets, moving as fast as infrastructure and best practices allow. Sell more sustainably produced products while maintaining the low prices customers expect: Packaging: Walmart pledges to work with suppliers to reduce product and packaging waste and preserve natural resources. Our goal by 2025 is for Walmart’s private brand packaging to be 100 percent recyclable. Affordable, safe and healthier: Walmart will double the sales of locally grown produce in the U.S. by 2025 and work with suppliers and its own private brand products to remove certified synthetic colors and artificial flavors in products where customers don’t expect to find them, as well as reduce sodium, added sugars and saturated fat where possible. Additionally, Walmart will expand and enhance sustainable sourcing to cover 20 key commodities, including bananas, grapes, coffee, and tea. Natural resources: Walmart is expanding sourcing of commodities produced with zero net deforestation. In partnership with governments, NGOs and industry groups, Walmart has previously been working to source private-brand palm oil and beef from Brazil’s Amazon with zero net deforestation. Under the roadmap, Walmart will expand its work into additional critical commodities, including all Brazilian soy and private-brand pulp and paper. McMillon also discussed the company’s $2.7 billion investment over the past two years in education, wages and training for associates in the U.S. and called for a broader industry push to ensure retailers are seen as employers of choice. “Today we are asking other retailers to join us in helping people live better,” he said. “Let’s use our collective power to create good jobs with good training that become good careers for all our associates.” Walmart will work to achieve the following: Support the human dignity of workers in the retail supply chain: Walmart is to ensure ethical recruitment and treatment of workers globally. This is on top of Walmart’s work underway in four areas that present risk to the dignity and safety of workers: seafood; apparel; produce; and electronics. Be the place to go for an individual’s first job: Walmart will further its efforts to afford a good experience for the thousands of people who come to the retailer for their first job. Associates will be provided with workplace mobility — a good start, new skills and a clear path to grow and succeed — joining the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment, a collaboration of businesses and NGO partners working whether or not they remain with the company. To further these efforts, Walmart has recently signed on to the White House First Jobs Compact, a nationwide effort to help connect out-of-school, out-of- work youth to their first jobs. Provide a clear path for career advancement: By 2025, Walmart U.S. will put millions of associates through focused training programs to equip them with skills to improve career growth, from entry level positions to jobs with more responsibility and higher pay. The retailer’s Pathways program provides training in core skills for entry-level associates and rewards them with a pay increase upon completion. The Academy training program – for supervisory associates – is expected to graduate 250,000 people alone by the end of 2017. As part of this commitment, Walmart strives to be a destination employer for young people and returning service members. Predictability, stability and pay: Walmart is committed to improving predictability in the lives of its associates by providing work schedules more than two weeks in advance in the U.S.; as well as implementing a strong leave policy that empowers associates to decide how to use their paid time off based on individual needs. Walmart also believes in equal pay for equal work. Associates with the same qualifications, performing the same jobs and making the same effort to achieve the same results, should receive the same pay. Improve the lives of people in communities: Walmart will source more products locally around the world, including $250 billion in products supporting American jobs by 2023 and $20 billion in products from women-owned businesses in the U.S. by the end of this year. The retailer also committed to donating 4 billion meals to fight hunger by 2020 and, over five years, to contributing $25 million towards disaster relief and resiliency around the world.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) won’t be left behind. The online retailer has launched its own early bird deals on a wide variety of items — 8,788 items to be exact. Amazon’s major competitor for online sales is, perhaps surprisingly to some, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT). Including products carried by its marketplace sellers, Amazon offers more than 350 million products to its customers. Of that total, some 12.23 million are sold directly by Amazon. Wal-Mart claims it will have more than 20 million items for sale this year, with many millions more to come in the coming months. The company did not say if it is selling all those items directly or if some are sold by affiliate merchants. In any event, that’s still a lot of stuff. Among Amazon’s deals of the day for Friday is an assortment of athletic gear from Adidas. The company’s men’s Superstar RT Fashion Sneakers (ASIN: B01MXBT1OQ) in white or Night Indigo are on sale Friday for $45, a savings of 50% from the regular price of $90. An Adidas men’s Sport Luxe Bomber Jacket (model #F1625PM801) is on sale for $59.99, a 40% savings from the regular price of $100.00. This price is only good for Friday. ATGOIN Bluetooth wireless headphones (ASIN #B01E349FPY) are a daily deal for Friday at $26.99, a savings of 60% from the regular price of $66.99.

(File/THE ASSOCIATED PRESS) Anne D'Innocenzio, The Associated Press Published Friday, November 4, 2016 9:01AM EDT NEW YORK -- Wal-Mart is laying out its environmental map for the next several years as it tries to satisfy customers who want green products at affordable prices. The world's largest retailer says it will seek to reduce emissions in its own operations by 18 per cent by 2025, and work toward adding no waste to landfills in key markets like Canada and the United States. It also plans to be powered by 50 per cent clean and renewable energy sources. Wal-Mart's goals, being announced Friday by CEO Doug McMillon, follow a plan set in 2005 as the company sought to deflect criticism of its practices and burnish its image. Wal-Mart has extended its efforts since then into its supply chain, which because of its size -- more than 10,000 stores globally -- gives it outsized influence on the overall industry. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer is under pressure from consumers, especially millennials, who want environmentally friendly items and are choosing carefully where to spend their money. Wal-Mart is looking at technology that will let shoppers scan food to learn its origins and other information, beyond just tagging products with "green labels." Kathleen McLaughlin, a Wal-Mart senior vice-president who leads the company's sustainability efforts, said she couldn't estimate how much the programs will save or cost. While they have an impact on society, they overall also make good business sense, she said. Some areas of focus include: SUSTAINABILITY: The company will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures and expand its use of clean and renewable sources to reduce emissions in its operations. Wal-Mart says it will be the first retailer to have an emissions plan approved under the process laid out under the Paris Agreement on climate change. Wal-Mart also plans to work with suppliers to reduce emissions, a big part of which will be at its 600 factories in China. Wal-Mart says it hopes to be adding zero waste to landfill in Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States by 2025. It plans to refine how it buys food so less of it goes unsold, and any that does is converted to pet food or fertilizers or diverted to charities. PRODUCTS: The company wants its private-brand packaging to be 100 per cent recyclable. It also plans to double sales of locally grown produce by 2025. It's also working with suppliers and its private-label products to eliminate certified synthetic colours and artificial flavours and get rid of other food additives where possible. WORKERS: Wal-Mart plans to work with industry groups and others to ensure that workers globally in sectors like seafood, produce, clothing and electronics are not forced to pay fees to land jobs and are not taken advantage of by recruiting agents. It plans to train suppliers to monitor whether workers, many of them migrants, are being exploited. Wal-Mart was among the companies to which an Associated Press probe last year traced seafood that came through a fishing industry that used slave labour. The seafood was also linked to supermarkets and pet suppliers such as Kroger, Whole Foods, and Petco. Diane Regas, executive director at the Environmental Defence Fund, says Wal-Mart deserves credit for more than meeting its sustainability commitment. "I think that surprises people," Regas said, but added, "There is a huge amount more to be done."

This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161104005437/en/ Among other things, Walmart is doubling sales of locally grown produce in the U.S.; expanding and enhancing sustainable sourcing to cover 20 key commodities, including bananas, coffee and tea; and implementing a new plan designed to achieve science-based targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Walmart is the first retailer with an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement in December 2015. Under the approved plan, Walmart will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures, together with a commitment to source half of the company’s energy needs from renewable sources, to achieve an 18 percent emissions reduction in its own operations by 2025. Additionally, Walmart will work with suppliers to reduce emissions by 1 Gigaton by 2030, equivalent to taking more than 211 million passenger vehicles off of U.S. roads and highways for a year. In his remarks, McMillon will also discuss company programs that will train hundreds of thousands of U.S. associates by the end of next year, providing them with skills needed to move from entry-level positions to jobs with more responsibility and higher pay, along with a new pledge to take a leadership role in promoting ethical recruitment and treatment of workers in the global retail supply chain. Taken together, the initiatives are designed to make good on the company’s desire to become the most trusted retailer, not just by delivering affordable goods and a time-saving shopping experience, but with trust-building transparency and actions. “We want to make sure Walmart is a company that our associates and customers are proud of - and that we are always doing right by them and by the communities they live in,” McMillon said. “That’s really what these commitments are about. And that’s why we’re so passionate about them.” The roadmap builds upon the three environmental sustainability goals Walmart set in 2005: to create zero waste in company operations, to operate with 100 percent renewable energy, and to sell products that sustain natural resources and the environment. Those aspirational goals have guided how Walmart engages on those vital issues and progress has been made toward them. The new roadmap builds on progress to date, but also broadens the company’s vision of its role in society. The commitments shared today include: McMillon will also discuss the company’s $2.7 billion investment over the past two years in education, wages and training for associates in the U.S. and called for a broader industry push to ensure retailers are seen as employers of choice. “Today we are asking other retailers to join us in helping people live better,” he said. “Let’s use our collective power to create good jobs with good training that become good careers for all our associates.” Walmart will work to achieve the following: About Walmart Walmart Stores, Inc.

Wal-Mart is looking at technology that will let shoppers scan food to learn its origins and other information, beyond just tagging products with “green labels.” Kathleen McLaughlin, a Wal-Mart senior vice-president, said she couldn’t estimate how much the programs will save or cost. While they have an impact on society, they overall also make good business sense, she said. Some areas of focus include: SUSTAINABILITY: The company will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures and expand its use of clean and renewable sources to reduce emissions in its operations. Wal-Mart says it will be the first retailer to have an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets initiative in partnership with the Paris Climate Agreement in December 2015. The Science-Based Targets initiative is a partnership with World Wildlife Fund, World Resources Institute and others. Wal-Mart will also work with suppliers to scale back emissions by one gigaton by 2030, which it says is equivalent to taking 211 million cars from the road a year. Wal-Mart says it hopes to be adding zero waste to landfills in Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States by 2025. It plans to refine how it buys food so less of it goes unsold, and any that does is converted to pet food or fertilizers or diverted to charities. PRODUCTS: The company wants its private-brand packaging to be 100 per cent recyclable. It also plans to double sales of locally grown produce by 2025. It’s also working with suppliers and its private-label products to eliminate certified synthetic colours and artificial flavours and get rid of other food additives where possible. WORKERS: Wal-Mart plans to work with industry groups and others to ensure that workers globally in sectors like seafood, produce, clothing and electronics are not forced to pay fees to land jobs and are not taken advantage of by recruiting agents. It plans to train suppliers to monitor whether workers are being exploited. Wal-Mart was among the companies to which an Associated Press probe last year traced seafood that came through a fishing industry that used slave labour. The seafood was also linked to supermarkets and pet suppliers such as Kroger, Whole Foods, and Petco. Diane Regas, executive director at the Environmental Defence Fund, says Wal-Mart deserves credit for more than meeting its sustainability commitment. “I think that surprises people,” Regas said, but added, “There is a huge amount more to be done.” ____ Follow Anne D’Innocenzio http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Leave a comment Cancel reply Sign in to comment.

(The Canadian Press) CTV Winnipeg Published Friday, November 4, 2016 4:22AM CST Visa is giving Manitobans the chance to earn credit for spending money at grocery stores other than Walmart. If Manitoba cardholders spend $50 or more at other grocery stores, they’ll earn a $10 credit. The new ad campaign comes less than two weeks after Walmart stopped accepting Visa at all 16 of its Manitoba locations. Walmart and Visa have been at a standstill over credit card fees. The retail giant said the fees add up to more than $100million a year, while Visa said it offered Walmart one of its lowest fees. Manitoba Visa cardholders have until Nov. 15 to register their card for this offer.

(CBC) Tom Murphy Host Tom Murphy is co-host CBC Nova Scotia's supper hour news program and correspondent for The National. He also hosts Land and Sea and is brother to Bob. Related Stories Walmart vows change amid concerns over food waste How Canada sucks at reducing food waste Here's how much food Walmart throws away over 12 days Walmart insider says 'heartbreaking' amount of food dumped in trash The executive director of Feed Nova Scotia says food banks need to strategically go after food waste or what he calls "a very big prize." "If we got one-tenth of that we would double the impact of what we are doing right now," Nick Jennery said. He argued food banks must do more to prevent retailers from throwing out good food. A recent CBC Marketplace investigation found stores in Canada waste an estimated $3 billion of food annually. It found dumpsters full of seemingly edible food at Walmart stores across the country. Walmart insider says 'heartbreaking' amount of food dumped in trash Jennery said Feed Nova Scotia is trying to figure out the logistics of how it can get more of that food to the hungry. It's why the organization recently leased several new refrigerator trucks that are now crossing the province. They stop at major grocery retailers to pick up perishables and other foods. Food banks could be tapping into seemingly good food wasted by grocery store chains, volunteers say. (CBC) Food banks should learn more in order to tap into big retailers as a supply chain, Jennery said. "What are their store practices when they pull product off the shelf? What types of products? How much product is available?" he said. "We've got five trucks. I'm more than willing to reconstruct that if we can pick up the food in a more timely way — if I know there's more food to pick up — so we're having those conversations right now." Trying to be flexible In other words, Jennery wants to make it easy for retailers, who are in the business of selling food, not feeding the hungry, to get rid of what they deem to be food waste. "The more flexible we can be I think the more they might donate," Feed Nova Scotia truck driver Jimmy Nickerson said. "There's a potential to get even more, definitely." Jimmy Nickerson, a truck driver for Feed Nova Scotia, says he hopes they can be flexible to make it easy for stores to donate. (CBC) Once a week, Feed Nova Scotia goes to Costco, Sobeys, Walmart and Superstore stores across the province to pick up donations of regular groceries — anything destined for the dumpster could still be eaten. Jane Threlfall, manager of Walmart in Truro, N.S., says regular pick ups by food banks would help. (CBC) Jane Threlfall, manager of Walmart in Truro, N.S., said having a refrigerator truck pull up to their door at a regular time makes it a lot easier for the store to make a donation. "For us it means we are able to give them perishable goods, such as meat, cheeses, yogurt," she said. "Things like cold products that would at one point retailers may have to destroy, we are able to hang on to those and give it to them, as well."

Shopping 5 0 0 November 4, 2016 Black Friday 2016 Ads: JCPenney And Kohl’s Are The Latest Leaks — Is Walmart Next? Phillip Dengler Black Friday 2016, which will take place on November 25 this year, is now only three weeks away. While ads have been leaking daily over the past few weeks, there has been a lack of news from major retailers. That has all changed over the course of the past 24 hours, as Black Friday ads have leaked from JCPenney and Kohl’s. While frugal shoppers are still anxiously awaiting ads from Walmart, Best Buy, and Target, they are going to have to wait a little longer. The good news is that the remaining ads from major retailers should be out by the end of next week, with Walmart being the last of the group. Amazon does not release a traditional ad, but you can keep an eye on an upcoming press release to announce their doorbusters. JCPenney Sale Information and Circular The 72-page JCPenney 2016 Black Friday ad was posted to BestBlackFriday.com on November 4. Disclaimer: The author, Phillip Dengler, is the owner of BestBlackFriday.com, which is referenced in this article. The Inquisitr holds no ownership. [Image via JCPenney] As they did last year, JCPenney will open at 3 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. They will remain open the entire night and end their sale at 5 p.m. on Black Friday. In 2015, their doorbusters ended at 2 p.m. on Friday, so their sale this year is three hours longer. While it is not explicitly stated, their online sale is probably going to be live the entire day on Thanksgiving. Early arrivers on Thanksgiving at traditional brick-and-mortar locations have the chance to win one of the following coupons. $500 off $500 (valid in-store or at jcp.com 11/24-12/24) $100 off $100 or more (valid in-store or at jcp.com 11/24-12/24) $10 off $10 or more (valid in-store or at jcp.com 11/24-12/24) While this ad lacks many of the more exciting electronic doorbusters, it does have quite a few solid deals on home items, toys, and clothing. Here are a few notables. Boots for Her for $19.99 (reg. $60-$90) Cooks Power Blender for $7.99 after Rebate Home Expressions 100% Cotton Ombre Stripe or Sold Bath Towel for $2.99 (reg. $10) Up to 40$ Off Major Appliances Pyrex 8-piece Sculptured Bowl Set for $10 after Rebate Cooks 12-piece Stainless Steel Cookware Set for $29.99 after Rebate All orders over $99 at JCPenney’s website will ship for free. All orders over $25 will ship to your nearest store for free. Considering how easy it is to qualify for free shipping at other retailers, it is not recommended that you ever pay shipping charges on Black Friday. Target and Best Buy will both offer free shipping with no minimum order size this holiday season, and other retailers have easier requirements to meet. Kohl’s Sale Information and Circular The 64-page Kohl’s Black Friday 2016 ad was posted to Savings.com on November 3. [Image via Kohl’s] As they did in 2015, Kohl’s will begin their in-store Thanksgiving sale at 6 p.m. Black Friday deals will actually begin on their website on Monday, November 21, but many of the top doorbusters will not be available until Thanksgiving. While Kohl’s will remain open all day on Black Friday, their doorbuster sale will end at 1 p.m. Unlike last year, their first-page doorbusters will also be available online. This has been a recent trend over the past few years, but Kohl’s held out last year. Regardless, they will join the likes of Walmart and Best Buy in ensuring that Black Friday will eventually become more of an online event than an offline sale. Here are a few notable items from the sale. Sony PlayStation 4 Slim Uncharted Bundle + $75 in Kohl’s Cash for $249.99 (save $50) Microsoft Xbox One S Minecraft Bundle + $75 in Kohl’s Cash for $249.99 (save $50) Fitbit Charge 2 Heart Rate + Fitness Wristband + $30 Kohl’s Cash for $129.99 (save $20) Haier 49-in. 4K Ultra HD TV + $75 Kohl’s Cash for $249.99 (save $100) Save 50 percent on Toys from Various Popular Brands Apple Watch Series 2 38mm + $105 Kohl’s Cash for $369 While the prices on those items will be available at other retailers, the Kohl’s Cash makes all of the difference. Members can earn $15 in Kohl’s Cash for every $50 spent. While this is not a direct discount, it adds to the overall savings. Free shipping is available on all orders over $75. This was the rate last year, and it is somewhat surprising that Kohl’s has not dropped to a lower minimum. Walmart, Best Buy, and Target Projected Black Friday Ad Leak Dates As the Inquisitr recently reported, the rest of the major leaks should come next week. Based on previous year’s data, here are the projected dates. Target – November 8 Best Buy – November 9 Walmart – November 10 Amazon (Press Release) – November 16, 2016 As noted above, Amazon does not actually have an ad, but they will put out a press release to announce their top doorbusters. Now we want to hear from you. Will you be shopping at JCPenney or Kohl’s on Thanksgiving and Black Friday this year? What are your favorite deals from the ads? Tell us in the comment section below.

Walmart will add Chase Pay to its app USA TODAY 11/4/2016 Chris Woodyard © Gunnar Rathbun, Invision for Walmart Walmart customers checkout at the retailer's Black Friday event last year in Rogers, Ark. When Chase customers go shopping at Walmart next year, they'll have another option for paying via their smartphones instead of credit cards. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 70.49 -0.74 -1.04% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 105.71 -2.72 -2.51% CVS Health Corp CVS ▲ 76.00 +0.91 +1.21% The giant retailer announced Thursday that it will add the Chase Pay feature to its Walmart Pay app, creating another payment option for shoppers wielding digital devices for shopping online. The announcement comes as retailers rush to add as many easy digital ways to pay as possible -- and banks and credit card issuers try to make sure they are not left behind by the mobile payment revolution that has already given rise to Apple Pay. Digital payment apps have the side benefit of speeding up checkout lines, which have slowed down due to new. higher security chip-based credit cards. The joint Chase and Walmart announcement comes as other retailers rush to create payment apps. CVS Health, for instance, announced in August that it will roll out payment via its app across the country. Almost one of five U.S. consumers are expected to use their smartphones for in-store purchases this year., according eMarketer. The number is expected to climb 62% compared to last year to 37.5 million and is sure to grow more. Chase, which says it has 94 million consumer credit, debit and prepaid card accounts, says the deal with Walmart will "provide customers yet another way to use Chase Pay for everyday shopping,” says Jennifer Roberts, president of strategic alliances and loyalty solutions.

According to Reuters, that's because bets on faster U.S. growth and inflation are leading investors to favor stocks over bonds. A two-day thumping wiped out more than $1 trillion across global bond markets worldwide, on bets that plans under a Trump administration would boost business investments and spending while firing up inflation. It was the worst rout in nearly 1-1/2 years.

Zachary McClimans, 22, of Sharon, said he had reported the issue to management at the Hermitage store last week but 'no decision had been made' regarding the other employee, police said in a criminal complaint on Friday. McClimans decided one 'solution' to prevent his co-worker, identified as Jayson Hall, from harming him was shooting him, according to court documents. Scroll down for video  Walmart shooting suspect Zachary McClimans, 22, (left and right) said he opened fire on his co-worker because the employee was offended he was changing genders to female and had threatened him, police said McClimans shot his coworker, identified as Jayson Hall, with his grandfather's .380-caliber pistol inside the store in Hermitage, Pennsylvania on Thursday at about 10.30pm. People stand outside the store following the shooting So McClimans took his grandfather's .380-caliber pistol, drove to the store and shot Hall inside at about 10.30pm on Thursday, police said. McClimans, who had left during his shift earlier in the day before returning to the store later that night, had originally planned to shoot the Hall outside the store. However, 'he felt so strongly about shooting Hall that he could not wait, at which time he tracked down Hall inside the store,' according to the complaint. Hall - who was found in a back stockroom - was shot four times, including twice in the back, according to authorities. Chaotic scenes followed inside the store as frantic customers and Walmart employees were seen fleeing, WKBN reported. When officers arrived, witnesses told police the shooter was still at the store in the parking lot. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Number of gay characters on network TV hits record high -...

He was taken to a local hospital where he is listed in stable condition Officers then approached the vehicle where McClimans was sitting inside, who had a gun with him that was taken into evidence. He surrendered to police and was arrested at the scene, according to the station.  Hall was taken to St. Elizabeth Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio, where he is listed in stable condition. He is expected to recover, Hermitage police said. While McClimans told police he is switching genders, it was not known if he has begun identifying as female. Police checked the box marked 'male' on the criminal complaint and did not list any feminine aliases for McClimans. The Walmart store in Hermitage, about 70 miles north of Pittsburgh, closed overnight Thursday following the shooting and reopened on Friday morning. Store employees would not comment, but Walmart spokesman Charles Crowson confirmed in an email that one worker was injured and said one worker was fired. 'Our thoughts are with the associate who was injured. The other associate involved has been terminated,' Crowson said.  'We're continuing to gather all of the facts and work closely with law enforcement.' Following the shooting, officers at the scene located him inside a vehicle in the parking lot. He surrendered and was taken into custody McClimans has been charged with attempted murder, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, theft and carrying a firearm without a license Walmart said police would have to answer any questions about McCliman's allegation of harassment at the store. The victim named in the criminal complaint is not charged with a crime and could not immediately be reached to respond to McClimans' accusations against him. Police did not return calls seeking additional information about Hall or other aspects of the shooting. McClimans has been charged with attempted murder, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, theft and carrying a firearm without a license, WTAE reported. An attorney for him was not listed in court documents. Phone calls to several of his relatives went unanswered, except for one man who refused to give his name and declined to comment.

Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to sidebar News Retail & Marketing More Visa ups ante in battle with Walmart by offering Manitobans $10 to shop where card is accepted Barbara Shecter, Financial Post  11.03.2016 Visa / Financial Post ShareAdjustCommentPrint Visa Inc., which has accused Walmart of using customers as leverage after the retail giant said in June it would stop accepting the credit card in Canadian stores, appears to be ratcheting up the months-long battle by offering $10 credits to cardholders in Manitoba who shop elsewhere. The new promotion, which will run throughout November in Manitoba, doesn’t specifically name Walmart, the U.S.-owned retail giant that sells clothing, toys, household items, and groceries. But the $10 credit is being offered to Visa cardholders who register their card and then make a purchase of $50 or more at a grocery store in Manitoba. “We hope this eases the inconvenience for Visa cardholders in Manitoba who cannot use their card everywhere they may want to,” Visa Canada spokesperson Carla Hindman said in an interview. Alex Roberton, a spokesman for Walmart Canada, told CBC News: “We don’t comment on how other organizations want to promote their brand.” Walmart Canada stopped accepting Visa cards in Manitoba stores on Oct. 24, following the initial withdrawal from stores in Thunder Bay, Ont. after a dispute over fees. Negotiations broke down between the credit card company and the retailer in June, and Walmart declared it would stop accepting Visa cards in stores across the country beginning the following month. At the time, Walmart said the fees it was charged for accepting Visa were “unacceptably high,” and its aim was to keep all costs as low as possible so it could keep prices low for customers. In an open letter to cardholders and other merchants in June, Visa said it had already offered Walmart “one of the lower rates” of any merchant in Canada, and accused the retailer of demanding rates even lower than what the credit card company charges charities and schools. “They believe that their cost to accept Visa cards should be much lower than all other merchants… And yes, charities and schools too’,” Visa said in the letter, which was published in newspapers including the National Post. We don’t comment on how other organizations want to promote their brand The letter also accused Walmart of “using their size and scale to give themselves an unfair advantage.” The fees the companies are at odds over are called “interchange” fees, which are paid by all merchants on each credit card transaction. Once collected, the fees are shared by banks that issue the credit cards, credit card processors, and credit card networks like Visa and MasterCard. Interchange fees have come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with retail groups and some politicians arguing that they ultimately drive up the cost of goods for consumers. In late 2014, after a series of negotiations, the fees charged to retailers in Canada were voluntarily reduced in a move that kept the government from entering the fray and regulating the interchange rates set by credit card networks. But retail and consumer groups have continued to complain that the rates in Canada outstrip those in jurisdictions including Australia and parts of Europe. A banking industry source told the Financial Post last summer that the dispute between Visa and Walmart could put some $82 million in interchange fees at stake for the Canadian banks that issue Visa cards. While not material, the amount is not insubstantial either, the source said, suggesting banks could put put pressure on Visa to head back to the negotiating table and cut a deal to lower fees charged to the retailing giant.

The exact number of robots to be installed at Walmart was not disclosed, yet the Estonian company plans on reaching 15,000 units total across the pond. US retail chain Walmart is huge: they are the retail business with the world's biggest turnover, employing a total of over two million people, and come in second place only to Amazon in e-commerce turnover. E-commerce, however, requires solid logistics, and this is where Estonian business Cleveron, whose headquarters are located in Viljandi, comes into play. The company's PackRobots, which will begin serving more and more Walmart customers in the future, are likewise built in the Southern Estonian city. Customers making purchases from Walmart's online store can order their goods to be delivered to the Cleveron PackRobot for pickup. The first unit is already up and running in Bentonville, Arkansas, home of the retail giant's headquarters. "The first PackRobot has been in Walmart since mid-September," confirmed Cleveron founder and board member Arno Kütt. "So far we have received very positive feedback from there; clients have embraced [the package terminal]." Cleveron's PackRobot technology was likewise developed in Viljandi. The company considers the opportunity to get its foot in the door with the first automated package machine on the US market to be its breakthrough moment. This was achieved in cooperation with machine maintenance firm Bell&Howell, with whom the Estonian company signed a cooperation agreement one year ago; certification and testing followed the signing of the contract. "The existence of such a partner was a prerequisite for cooperation with Walmart," explained Kütt. "Over 700 maintenance workers across the US work for Bell&Howell, and they will be maintaining our machines." In the future, assembly is expected to take place on location in the US as well.

The giant retailer announced Thursday that it will add the Chase Pay feature to its Walmart Pay app, creating another payment option for shoppers wielding digital devices for shopping online. The announcement comes as retailers rush to add as many easy digital ways to pay as possible -- and banks and credit card issuers try to make sure they are not left behind by the mobile payment revolution that has already given rise to Apple Pay. Digital payment apps have the side benefit of speeding up checkout lines, which have slowed down due to new. higher security chip-based credit cards. The joint Chase and Walmart announcement comes as other retailers rush to create payment apps. CVS Health, for instance, announced in August that it will roll out payment via its app across the country. Almost one of five U.S. consumers are expected to use their smartphones for in-store purchases this year., according eMarketer. The number is expected to climb 62% compared to last year to 37.5 million and is sure to grow more. Chase, which says it has 94 million consumer credit, debit and prepaid card accounts, says the deal with Walmart will "provide customers yet another way to use Chase Pay for everyday shopping,” says Jennifer Roberts, president of strategic alliances and loyalty solutions.

Bloomberg News Subscribe Reprints November 3, 2016 — 9:00 PM EDT Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp In the U.S., Walmart Stores’ members-only warehouse chain, Sam’s Club, offers a wide array of products, from bulk groceries to patio furniture, at discounted prices in cavernous, no-frills stores where goods are stacked on metal shelves. Walmart is doing the same thing in China but with some pricey twists, including $3,200 Zojirushi rice cookers and $295,000 diamond rings. Over the past two years, the retailer has repositioned the 14 Sam’s Clubs in the country to offer more expensive products. Shoppers can pick up $500 Dyson hair dryers, $1,700 bottles of 1995 Château Lafite Rothschild red wine, and $7,000 high-tech massage chairs, in addition to imported pistachios and desserts conjured up by Michelin-rated chefs. There’s even a $4,100 Laurastar ironing system that comes with four hours of in-home instruction. Unlike its small business focus in America, Sam’s Club on the mainland is all about catering to the whims and preferences of an emerging middle and upper class willing to spend more for premium items. A BMW sedan on display inside a Sam's Club store in Tianjin. Photographer: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg “Our member is a very aspirational shopper,” says Andrew Miles, chief operating officer of Sam’s Club in China. “Their desire is for a better life and to show their wealth to their family and friends, to show that they are a smart, savvy shopper. That’s the ambition we want to fill.” Walmart sees big potential in China: Its Sam’s Club in Shenzhen, a fast-growing urban center in the southeast, is the chain’s best-performing outlet globally. Walmart, which posted $482 billion in revenue for its fiscal year ended Jan. 31, doesn’t break out China sales, but it says the growth of clubs there is among its fastest globally. Chinese memberships now number 1.8 million and are growing 10 percent to 12 percent annually. In addition to rolling out a premium product lineup, the retailer almost doubled its annual membership fee in April, to 260 yuan ($40), to attract more upscale shoppers, those earning at least $25,000 in yearly household income, roughly three times the nation’s average in 2014. Miles says members remaining after the fee increase spent 8 percent more on average per visit. “Sam’s Club’s potential in China is greater than anywhere,” says Walmart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon. Members “want a fine bottle of wine, they want a great fresh-food experience, they want a 4k television,” he says, referring to the latest high-resolution technology. “Even a $15,000 price point can be a great value for what you are getting.” That upmarket tack—from a Samsung curved TV for $26,000 to a 61-bottle collection of Médoc wines, complete with its own cooler, for $14,472—capitalizes on a Chinese bias toward imports. They see them as higher-quality and safer after domestic suppliers experienced some recent well-publicized food-safety concerns. “I don’t have to go through online channels to get foreign brands now,” says He Lihui, a 35-year-old sales executive who was shopping at the Shenzhen Sam’s Club for Wonderful brand pistachios from the U.S. and waffles made with European ingredients. A customer looks at flat screen TVs. Photographer: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg Sam’s Club’s own brands, such as its Member’s Mark private-label oatmeal and kitchen towels, or the Asda brand developed for Walmart stores in Britain, aren’t perceived as high-end in their home markets, according to Jack Chuang, OC&C Strategy Consultants’ Greater China partner. But Sam’s Club has been pitching the foreign provenance of its house-branded items and selling them for less than what imports generally cost in China. “What they’ve done in China is a rebranding exercise using the fact that to Chinese shoppers, ‘imported’ is a badge for premium,” he says. Walmart aims to more than double the number of Sam’s Clubs there to 35 in three years, and it’s built an entire mall with a 1,900-car parking lot for a 5,000-square-meter (54,000-square-foot) store in Zhuhai, near the casino island of Macau. The investment in the new mall, which has leased space to Starbucks, Uniqlo, and other big brands, became necessary because other potential retail sites lacked adequate parking. Similar projects with malls anchored by Sam’s Clubs are planned in Jiangxi and Guizhou provinces. Sam’s Club’s success is in sharp contrast to the performance at the 412 Walmart-branded stores on the mainland, where McMillon says sales are flat. Big brick-and-mortar retailers such as Walmart and France’s Carrefour have struggled as Chinese consumers increasingly turn to e-commerce platforms for electronics and other non-perishable goods, both of which are high-margin categories at Walmart’s large stores in China, says Wai-Chan Chan, a senior partner in the Asia-Pacific retail and consumer practice at consultant Oliver Wyman. In an attempt to remedy that, Walmart on Oct. 20 announced a distribution partnership with JD.com, China’s second-largest e-commerce company after Alibaba Group. Customers can now order Walmart items from around the world through a store on JD.com; they’re delivered using the e-commerce company’s sprawling fulfillment system, which reaches homes in 90 percent of the country. Already, customers living near 20 Walmarts can get purchases delivered within two hours; more stores will be added later. A customer pushes a loaded shopping cart near the entrance. Photographer: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg Sam’s Club has also opened a flashy online storefront on JD.com, making its items available to nonmembers for the first time, albeit at a 10 percent premium. “We’re indifferent as to the format,” McMillon says. “Our job is to make sure that we are there to serve customers however they want to be served.” One bonus from boosting online access: Sam’s Club can use the geographic data from e-commerce sales to identify where it should set up warehouses next, says Walmart China’s senior vice president for e-commerce, Ben Hassing. Sam’s Club has no major club rivals in China. Its biggest American competitor, Costco Wholesale, doesn’t operate brick-and-mortar stores there. That could change: Costco opened a store on Alibaba’s Tmall online platform last year, a move OC&C’s Chuang describes as “dipping their toes into the water.” For now, Sam’s Club has the pool—and the growth—to itself. —Bloomberg News The bottom line: Sam’s Club in China, whose membership is growing at 10 percent to 12 percent annually, is repositioning itself to sell pricier goods.

Walmart, the world's largest retailer, has more than 11,500 stores globally, while a combined Shoprite and Steinhoff would have 9,211 stores in Africa, Europe, the UK, US and Australasia. But the much-talked-about deal is still just that - speculation. Outgoing Shoprite CEO Whitey Basson told Business Times this week he had not calculated the valuations on the rumoured acquisition. "[Christo] Wiese is the controlling shareholder, so he may have done the sums on it to see how it will affect him. "I'm not the major shareholder of Steinhoff, in fact I'm a small shareholder in Steinhoff and a reasonable shareholder in Shoprite, but the elements will have to tell you if there's a merger," said Basson. Africa's grocer gets to sleep in after 37 years There has been speculation about the acquisition of Shoprite by integrated retailer Steinhoff since about 2006, but the deal may soon become a reality with Basson's retirement. The announcement of his departure from the biggest grocer in Africa saw Shoprite's share price gain about 4.19% to R199.90 at the close on Monday, the most it has risen in two months. An Investec report cited in the Financial Mail said Wiese controlled more than 50% of Shoprite's voting rights and he could use this to push through a deal before April, when his voting rights drop below 50%. Wiese has a 16% stake in Shoprite through ordinary shares and an additional 291.8million deferred shares held through Thibault Financial Services, which carry 35% of Shoprite's total voting rights. Wiese also has an 18% stake in Steinhoff. It is not clear what strategy a combined group would follow, but it would be a sizeable business. Alec Abraham, a senior equity analyst at Sasfin Wealth, said a merged entity would not be as significant as Walmart. "They [Walmart] have got their foot in Africa via Massmart. It's not quite in the same space as Shoprite, so I don't think it's necessarily a major threat to them in any way. "It depends, however, if a Steinhoff and Shoprite combination would want to develop into different types of categories and become a general merchandise retailer. I don't believe that is the case," said Abraham.     If Steinhoff does make an offer for Shoprite, it won't be the first time the grocery retailer has been a target. In 2007, Brait Private Equity offered to buy Shoprite for R26 a share, or an initial offer of R14.2-billion, but shareholders rejected the deal after failing to agree on a revised offer. Since 2007, both Shoprite and Steinhoff's share prices have risen over 300%. Four years later, Wiese was appointed a non-executive director of Brait. Steinhoff bought Pepkor from Brait last year, and more recently bought Tekkie Town. Slow talk on fast-food stew In September this year, Wiese invested a further R24.3-billion in Steinhoff to help finance its acquisition spree in Europe and North America. Steinhoff had already bought furniture businesses Mattress Land in the US and Fantastic Holdings in Australia. It also bought UK discount retailer Poundland. Victor Dima, an analyst at Arqaam Capital, said a Steinhoff-Shoprite merger would only happen if it made sense for the shareholders. Dima said Shoprite's share price had risen because "they posted very strong and unexpectedly good numbers, especially when you look at African growth, and more so growth in Africa in constant currencies, [which] is over 50%". "So the market would be reacting on this news primarily, and with the announcement of Whitey leaving and the replacement, the market was not disappointed." Wiese could not be reached for comment this week, but in October he dismissed rumours that Steinhoff was poised to buy Shoprite, saying discussions had been going on for a number of years. But it may not only be Steinhoff that is looking at Shoprite. "There may be other companies, it's not just Steinhoff in the world, maybe Anglo American," Basson joked. "If we could merge then I can get a plane for cheap." Shoprite's share price declined 2.72% to R186.05 by the close on Friday.

Hillsborough County State Attorney Mark Ober’s office wasted time and tax-payer money prosecuting a 57-year-old disabled mother for stealing $29 of flea medicine—allegedly because Ober didn't want to upset the local Walmart. In early 2014, Vicki Carll was walking out of a Tampa Walmart when she "two men grabbed her, manhandled her and dragged her back into the store," according to WTSP. From their report: At the time Carll says she was baffled. “I didn't know what was happening, I thought I was being mugged,  actually, because I had $500 in my hand and I didn't know what was going on, I had no idea.” It turned out Carll was being arrested for shoplifting. The security guard who was waiting on a bench next to the exit said she stole flea medication worth $29. According to a civil suit Carll filed against Walmart early this week, Carll had examined the flea medication while in the store, but put it back on the shelf once she realized it was the wrong kind. She hadn't realized that a "floor walker," a pseudo security-guard whose job is to identify shoplifters, had been following her around the store. Carll says that the floor walker, Arismendy Rosario, picked up the flea medication, planted the evidence, and then waited for her to leave the store. From WTSP: [Carll's Attorney Barry] Cohen claims this was an elaborate plan by the security guard to frame his client. In a lawsuit filed Monday afternoon, Cohen points out the security tape shows the guard, who just started that day, dumped something on the floor from a box and then seconds later accused Carll of stealing that item. According to Cohen, a veteran attorney, “I've never seen a case I can think about where the bad guy, in this case the Walmart employee, was actually caught on video planting the evidence." According to Carll's complaint, the video footage shows: Mr. Rosario himself removing the individual pet medication doses from its box as he sat on the bench awaiting Ms. Carll to arrive from the checkout register […] Mr. Rosario placing the individual medication doses on the ground underneath the bench where he sat and waited for Ms. Carll to arrive from the checkout register […] Rosario and [another employee] forcefully dragging Ms. Carll back inside the store entrance to the point next to Rosario’s bench under which he had hidden the medication. […] Mr. Rosario reaching back under the bench to retrieve the pet medications from where he had placed them. Mr. Rosario then accused Ms. Carll of stealing the medication. It was Mr. Rosario's first day on the job. Carll called the incident ”the most humiliating thing you could ever go through.” Despite the fact that video evidence clearly proved that Carll had not stolen anything, Ober's office arrested and charged Carll. Prosecutors spent ten months of time and money on the case, refusing to drop it and ultimately taking her to trial.  The jury took less than sixty seconds to acquit Ms. Carll of the crime. WTSP reported that one juror “said it seemed obvious the guard planted the evidence and couldn't believe the state wasted time and money with this case.” As is custom in shoplifting cases, Walmart could have asked the state's attorney's office not to press charges. But instead they asked prosecutors to bring charges, “apparently decid[ing] to carry the charade of criminal proceedings to their ultimate conclusion by jury trial just to try to protect itself from civil liability by not admitting the outrageous wrongdoing of its own employees,” according to the lawsuit. Ober's office should have refused to prosecute. The video evidence demonstrated that Carll had been framed. Not to mention the allegedly stolen items were only worth $29 anyway. But in the end, Ober spent ten months of time and tax payer dollars on a case that was the definition of open-and-shut. Why would Ober's office decide to charge her and take her to trial? Carll claims it's because Ober cared about Walmart instead of justice. Carll filed a lawsuit this week against the retail giant, as well as against Rosario, and the other employee who restrained her. From her complaint: Unfortunately, the decision by the Hillsborough County State Attorney to proceed with the charges against Ms. Carll and to take this farce all the way through a jury trial speaks more to the desire to maintain WAL-MART’s good graces, political influence and financial support in an election year than it does to the duty of a prosecutor to seek the truth and to subject a citizen to criminal charges only when there is a valid and good faith basis to believe that the person is, in fact, guilty of those charges. That sense of duty was conspicuously absent in this case, according to Ms. Carll’s jury. Ober is up for re-election on Tuesday. He's running against Democrat Andrew Warren, a former federal prosecutor. 217 Comments Share this article 221 221 221 217 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

Zachary McClimans, 22, of Sharon, told police he raised his concerns to management at the Hermitage store last week but "no decision had been made" regarding the other employee, police said in a criminal complaint Friday. McClimans decided one "solution" to the problem was shooting his co-worker so McClimans took his grandfather's .380-caliber pistol and drove to the store, the complaint said. Although McClimans originally planned to shoot the other employee outside the store, McClimans went in and shot him about 10:30 p.m. Thursday, the complaint said. The employee was shot four times, including twice in the back, authorities said. He was taken to St. Elizabeth Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio. Hermitage police said he's expected to recover. An attorney for McClimans wasn't listed in court documents. Phone calls to several of his relatives went unanswered, except for one man who refused to give his name and declined to comment. McClimans also is charged with aggravated assault and reckless endangerment, theft and carrying a firearm without a license. The Wal-Mart store in Hermitage, about 70 miles north of Pittsburgh, closed overnight Thursday after the shooting. It reopened Friday morning. Store employees wouldn't comment, but Wal-Mart spokesman Charles Crowson confirmed in an email that one worker was injured and said one worker was fired. "Our thoughts are with the associate who was injured. The other associate involved has been terminated," Crowson said. "We're continuing to gather all of the facts and work closely with law enforcement." Wal-Mart said police would have to answer any questions about McCliman's allegation of harassment at the store. Although McClimans told police he's switching genders, it wasn't known if he has begun identifying as female. Police checked the box marked "male" on the criminal complaint and did not list any feminine aliases for McClimans.

When Barb Johnson Frank spotted the red plaid shirt hanging on a rack in the men’s department at Wal-Mart late this summer, she snatched it up. It wasn’t the Official Lucky Husker Shirt yet, but she wore the button-down to the season opener and cheered the team to a 43-10 victory over Fresno State. And she wore it when the Huskers cruised past Wyoming 52-17. And when Week 3 rolled around with another Husker victory -- The Ducks! We beat the Ducks! -- she began to feel quite fond of the garment she’d considered merely “serviceable” when she purchased it. Then came Northwestern, that not-too-tough road game that looked pretty grim at halftime. Barb was there. Her shirt was there, but she’d stuffed it in her bag. “I layer,” the retired teacher explained Friday. Barb and her husband, Alan, were at the road game with longtime friends and fellow fans Carla and Rob Nixon. “So she puts it on and all the sudden, the game changes,” Carla said. Final score: 24-13. Huskers 4-0. And that’s when that piece of permanent press, made in Bangladesh, became Barb’s Official Lucky Husker Shirt. Her contribution to the 2016 team. Maybe you have a lucky Husker shirt, too. Or a pair of charmed earrings or a troll doll talisman (like Robert Smith), or a game-changing ritual, like watching the game from the kitchen if Nebraska fumbles or the other team scores (like Mary Ryan). Maybe you painted your toenails lime green in August (like me) and found yourself unable to switch to scarlet because the original shade got the team past Illinois and Indiana and Purdue. Or maybe the team went 7-0 because you vacuumed before sitting down to watch (like Pam Holmes). Or you rediscovered your corduroy Husker cap from 1990 and started donning it every Saturday (like Jerry Basham). You get it. You can’t call plays (admit it), and you can’t catch a pass, block a punt or open up a hole for Terrell Newby, but you do what you can. You hoist your Husker flag before 8 a.m. every game (like Sue Barie Buller) and the team keeps winning. You sit in the same spot to watch with your neighbors and the Huskers eke out another W. You record every game, you put Husker scarves on your Shelties’ necks, you faithfully wear the same cheesy football earrings. Which is why on the Thursday before the team’s trip to Camp Randall, Barb carefully folded her shirt with its perfect record -- and Top 10 ranking -- and slipped it into a plastic bag and walked into the Athletic Department offices. She handed it to a friendly young woman at the reception desk, saying: Here, this shirt needs to go to Wisconsin. “I told her I didn’t think it was necessary to have it on the field, just throw it in the equipment truck or something -- it just has to be within range.” She included a few photos in the package -- the lucky shirt hanging from the bronze arm of Bob Devaney, another of her godson with the same statue outside the stadium, a third of the happy post-game scene in Evanston. "Shirt was needed," she wrote in black marker. She included a handwritten note. Dear Coach Riley, Assistant Coaches and our Beloved Huskers … Barb Johnson Frank here. Love my Huskers and always will. The fan who grew up in Iowa and moved to Lincoln in 1971 wrote that this team was her favorite in all those years. You guys have heart -- for each other, for your school and the state, for challenges of all sorts, for the game … Enclosed please find my official LUCKY shirt. When I found Barb this week, courtesy of her friend Carla, she didn’t know what had happened to her shirt. The young woman at the athletic department had smiled “knowingly,” she said. “She seemed like she’d probably seen it all.” She probably had, said Mary Lyn Wininger, football office secretary for 21 years, 15 of them working for Tom Osborne. The most memorable: dozens of four-leaf clovers, picked, pressed, laminated and delivered by a female fan. “She wanted us to give them to the players for good luck,” the retired secretary said. (She can’t say for sure, but it might have been 1995. GBR.) On Friday, Barb posed once again with Bob Devaney. She wore her back-up lucky shirt, identical to the first one. (She bought two that day, just in case.) She explained why this 2016 team is so special. “I like the way Coach Riley thinks about his work and what it means to teach college students about life.” She explained her soft spot for his players. “I really do think they have heart. I appreciate just the way they’ve stood with each other through a really tough situation.” She didn’t go back to the football office to get her lucky shirt back. She wasn’t sure she wanted to know if it had made the trip. (It did, on the equipment truck.) Barb felt like the red plaid shirt from Wal-Mart had accomplished its mission, despite the loss in Madison. A fine record of 7-1. And a fan happy to be cheering her Huskers this Saturday night. Bringing them all the luck she possibly can straight from the bottom of her Big Red Heart. Reach the writer at 402-473-7218 or clangekubick@journalstar.com. On Twitter @TheRealCLK.

Zachary McClimans, 22, of Sharon, told police he raised his concerns to management at the store last week but “no decision had been made” regarding the other employee, police said in a criminal complaint Friday. McClimans decided one “solution” to the problem was shooting his co-worker, so he took his grandfather’s .380-caliber pistol and drove to the store, the complaint said. Although McClimans originally planned to shoot the other employee outside the store, McClimans went in and shot him about 10:30 p.m. Thursday, the complaint said. The employee was shot four times, including twice in the back, authorities said.

(WAVY) – Virginia Beach middle school students whose families lost items in Hurricane Matthew were treated to a Walmart shopping spree on Friday. The Plaza Middle School PTA collected donations to provide 23 families with $350 to spend at the Phoenix Drive location from 6 to 8 p.m. “It brings joy to me, and I hope that we brought joy to them,” said the school’s principal, Joe Burnsworth. 10 On Your Side walked the aisles with a family who lost everything in the storm. “We lost all of our furniture, and 90 percent of our clothes, it’s been rough,” said Shane Saddler. Saddler’s twins, Logen and Haylee, attend seventh grade at Plaza. Haylee and her mom were at their Windsor Oaks home when 17 inches of water poured in. “I felt quite upset,” Haylee told 10 On Your Side. During the shopping spree, called “Spend with a Friend,” the family filled shopping carts with toys, clothes, pillows, a Bible, and other items. “Just being thankful to have this opportunity to put smiles on the kids’ face, and for them to be able to get things that they need and want,” Shane said. The Saddlers said they’ve received help and assistance ever since the storm. “We have at church a disaster relief program,” Logen said. Someone connected to Haylee’s swim team provided a trailer for the family to stay in for the months it will take to repair their home. “You can see how many people have stepped forward,” the seventh grade girl told 10 On Your Side. While the storm has been devastating for the family, they are grateful for the help they’ve received. Shane said she is grateful for what the tragedy can teach to her children. “I would hope this would teach them to never take things for granted,” she said. “And always help somebody else who is in need.” The PTA will continue collecting donations for the holidays. If you’d like to help out, call Kim Henson at 757-816-2686 or make checks payable to Plaza Middle School PTA.

The smart speaker that's infused with Google Assistant can be yours for $129. It's Google's direct competitor for Amazon's Echo line, which means you shouldn't expect it to ever be sold by the mega-retailer. Google Home is a US-only product for now. Aside from being able to talk to it and ask it various questions, you can also control certain smart home devices (the list of supported ones should grow in the future). The 4K Chromecast Ultra which Google announced alongside the Home speaker has started shipping today, for those who pre-ordered from the Google store. The $69 device isn't officially available in any brick and mortar stores yet. And speaking of things that aren't officially available, the Daydream View VR headset should only be out on November 10, according to Google itself. That said, some people who have pre-ordered the Daydream View are starting to receive their units, which have been shipped early. That would normally be cause for celebration, but in this case there's a problem: using the headset requires an app called Google VR Services, which simply doesn't exist on the Play Store yet. We assume that will be published on November 10, so if you do get your Daydream View early, it looks like you'll have to wait a few days before you can use it.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News PECO Real Estate Partners (PREP) Acquires The Hanover Mall in Hanover, Massachusetts PARK CITY, Utah, Nov. 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — PECO Real Estate Partners (PREP) is pleased to announce that the company has acquired The Hanover Mall in Hanover, Massachusetts, previously owned by CW Capital. The center is the latest project to join the PREP Strategic Investments portfolio. PREP is an independent company that separated the Strategic and Net Lease Investments business units from Phillips Edison and Company in May 2015. “We are excited to add this regional shopping center located in the main retail corridor of Boston’s South Shore,” said Michael C. Phillips, PREP President and Chief Executive Officer. “The future of this project represents what PREP is about, transforming retail, creating value and developing a shopping center for people to shop, dine and gather for years for come.” The Hanover Mall, a single-level regional enclosed mall, is comprised of 732,101 square feet, anchored by Macy’s, Sears and Walmart with several national outparcel tenants including Dick’s Sporting Goods, Trader Joe’s, Panera Bread, Buffalo Wild Wings, Petco and Office Max. The property was built in 1971 and was last renovated in 2004. Situated on Route 53 with immediate access to Route 3, the major thoroughfare servicing the communities south of Boston, the property features average daily traffic counts in excess of 26,600 and 60,900 vehicles, respectively. With a legacy of transforming retail properties, PREP has the expertise and experience to optimize retail property value. PREP identifies prime locations with development or redevelopment opportunities through a focused investment strategy. The Strategic Investment portfolio currently has three projects, two of them ongoing. The ongoing projects include Kenwood Collection in Cincinnati, Ohio and The Shoppes at Parma in Parma, Ohio. Kenwood Collection is a mixed-use development located next to Kenwood Towne Centre. The development includes 293,000 square feet of class-A office space, known as the Tower at Kenwood Collection, and 260,000 square feet of retail space on two levels. In addition, the project features a 2,300-space parking garage. The Shoppes at Parma is in the midst of an exciting transformation through its multi-phase redevelopment. The 750,000 square-foot open air center is anchored by J.C. Penney, Dick’s Sporting Goods, recently opened Gordmans, Walmart Supercenter and Marc’s grocery store and features specialty retailers, services and a wide variety of dining options. “Hanover Mall represents an ideal opportunity for PREP to apply our expertise and revitalize this well-known property to its full potential,” said Roy Williams, PREP Chief Investment Officer. “Now that the acquisition process has been concluded, we look forward to focusing our efforts on a comprehensive strategy that will reinvent the retail experience.” About PECO Real Estate Partners (PREP) PREP has incorporated Phillips Edison & Company’s former development and strategic retail divisions and will focus on the acquisition, repositioning and management of power and lifestyle centers, enclosed malls, mixed-use retail projects and single-tenant developments.  PREP is a fully integrated real estate operating and asset management company. The company has expertise in every discipline of retail shopping center operation and management.

(Al Hartmann | The Salt Lake Tribune) The old Granite High School at 3300 S. 500 E. in South Salt Lake remains boarded up in July. A prominent developerís deal to buy the old property has been extended and a new development plan is in the works. Garbett Homes and Wasatch Property's previous plan included 78 homes and a retail center anchored by a neighborhood Wal-Mart grocery store and would have put $10.6 million in Granite School Districtís coffers. Residents reluctant to back residential plan that doesn’t include details on commercial half of site. Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) The South Salt Lake Planning Commission is expected to vote Nov. 17 on a new proposal to develop the southern half of the old Granite High School property. But the plan got 3½ hours of attention at the commission's meeting Thursday, where about 25 residents chimed in. A plan to develop the site of the closed century-old school with homes and a Wal-Mart grocery store on the northern portion died at the hands of a mayoral veto in March. Now, Garbett Homes has revived the deal with a proposal that focuses only on the less-controversial residential half of the lot. Garbett Homes has applied to change the land use to get started on construction of about 80 homes near 3540 S. 500 East. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The developer says the homes will imitate the style and solar capability of homes in the nearby Terra Sol development and feature a 1-acre park. The commission's feedback to Garbett Homes: The proposed park doesn't meet city standards for green space, and the commission also thinks it could be better situated to serve the larger public. Community Development Director Michael Florence says some of the speakers from the public liked the plan, and some listed lack of green space and wanting to preserve the property's history as concerns. Most opponents brought grievances from the old plan. Residents hesitated to back a plan that didn't specify what would happen to the commercial northern half of the old school site. "We made it clear to the Planning Commission that they had to consider the merits of the project that was in front of them, because the north half wasn't part of this project," said Florence.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR NEWS Critics cringe at Trump strategist Bannon's ties to alt-right, rhetoric targeting Mormons Democrat Elijah Cummings presses Jason Chaffetz to investigate Donald Trump's finances Poll reveals mixed feelings on Utah's 'Zion Curtain' law as restaurants plan new effort to tear down LDS classic 'Miracle of Forgiveness' fading away, and some Mormons say it's time Gov.

Times Community News Daily Pilot Weekend Nifty '50s hair curlers meet the 21st century Don Leach / Weekend A single Spoolies hair curler. A single Spoolies hair curler. (Don Leach / Weekend) Karen Robes Meeks In a large manufacturing plant in San Clemente, the product that took Jeanne James seven years to conceptualize and perfect began to take shape. Through a large window facing the manufacturing floor, James watched as a worker loosened hundreds of pink silicone Spoolies hair curlers from a steel mold and inspected them before placing them in bins. On any given day, roughly 6,000 curlers are made. For the South County resident, it's been a labor of love to develop the retro curler into a modern user-friendly product that is now being sold at 400 Wal-Mart stores across the country. "This isn't just a hair curler to me," said James, who serves as founder and CEO of the San Juan Capistrano-based business. "This needs to be a quality part that is just right and works well and measures right. It's very much a part of who I am." Don Leach / Weekend Spoolies Hair Curlers founder Jeanne James in the company's San Clemente factory. Spoolies Hair Curlers founder Jeanne James in the company's San Clemente factory. (Don Leach / Weekend) Created in the 1950s, the original Spoolies hair curlers allowed women to wrap their hair around rubber-based spools around and "sleep in comfort," resulting in "perfect pin curls" by morning. James' association with the original Spoolies dates back to her childhood in Missouri, where she was the lone straight-haired girl in an extended family of curly heads. "Everybody had curly, wavy hair but me," she said. "[My mother] wanted me to fit in, so she would give me an old-fashioned perm. You could smell it in your hair for at least a week." Spoolies gave James an excuse to forgo the smelly perms and please her mother, so she wore them every night.

(Don Leach / Weekend) Fast forward to 1995, when she and her husband were in Kenya for their church and their charity, Children's Health Education and Leadership Project. There she was moved by the Kenyan girls who weren't given educational opportunities because of how expensive it was to send them to school. "Ever since we left Kenya in 1996, it was engraved in my mind that these sweet Kenyan girls weren't going to get an opportunity to have an education," she said. "I can't help everyone, but maybe I can help a few, and the best way is to create a business. What can I do that I would love to be involved in and also help to benefit these girls?" After doing charity work in Spain, the couple returned to the U.S. in 2003 and James began researching a business. "I actually prayed about it, and I was just putting it out there that this is something I would really like to do for these girls," she said. She remembered Spoolies hair curlers and searched online to find out that Conair gave up the trademark a year earlier. So she applied for it and acquired it three years later. She worked to modernize the product, making it more pliable, heat-resistant and creating it out of silicone instead of rubber. She holds the utility and design patents for the Spoolies curler. "It was a lot of trial and error," she said. "I had to learn a lot about manufacturing. Manufacturing is still very much a man's world. When you show up at a manufacturing plant with a part from the '50s and say, 'Can I make this?' You don't get a call back. You can't come unprepared. You have to respect it." Don Leach / W Rows of new Spoolies hair curlers rest on a table. Rows of new Spoolies hair curlers rest on a table. (Don Leach / W) She immersed herself in the manufacturing world, hiring engineers to do two-and three-dimensional drawing of her curler. She attended trade shows and spoke to manufacturers about the molding process and what kinds of materials they used. She had prototypes made. "You have to prove yourself, especially as a woman, that you're sincere and you really want to make this product," she said. "By the time I got to [my current] manufacturing company [in 2014], I knew exactly what I wanted to do." James is seeing the work finally paying off for the company, which incorporated in 2014. Spoolies was one of a handful of businesses to receive a trendsetter award and prime placement at Cosmoprof North America, a major trade show that allow beauty manufacturers and entrepreneurs the ability to meet with industry buyers, distributors, retail buyers and salon and spa owners. "​Spoolies was really well-received by the market as it fits in with the trend of styling the hair without heat damage," said Daniela Ciocan, Cosmoprof North America Marketing Director. "Both the media and the buyers loved the product especially since it's a refresh of a true and tested product popular in the '60s that actually works. And you can use it even with dry hair and no heat is necessary to give you wavy healthy hair." That spurred interest from international buyers and from Wal-Mart. After meeting with two buyers in June to pitch Spoolies at Walmart's Open Call for U.S. products in Bentonville, Ark., James' curlers —the smaller pink curlers and the blue jumbo curlers — are being sold or about to be sold in some 400 Wal-Marts in the U.S. "Our customers are telling us that where a product is made matters," said Cindi Marsiglio, Wal-Mart's vice president of U.S. Manufacturing. "Second, we know there are some great advantages that come with a shorter supply chain when you can make your items closer to where you sell them such as cost reductions and potential job creation opportunities." The company in 2013 committed more than $250 billion toward purchasing U.S.-made products and has been holding summits to attract home-grown businesses. "Spoolies is one of those great examples," Marsiglio said. "We're proud of them and looking forward to seeing how the product does." That product visibility is huge for her company, which expected business to grow exponentially in the coming years, James said. "The possibilities are great for a small company like us," she said. "As the curlers are selling, I hope they sell welland expand our products to other stores." As for her efforts to support Kenyan girls, James already is making good on that promise. She recently purchased laptops and beds for a dorm that can accommodate 50 girls. "I would love Spoolies to grow to be able to help a lot of girls around the world," James said.

So have employees of utilities and telecom firms. Finally, after years of stagnant pay, more American workers are receiving meaningful raises — a trend driven home by the government's October jobs report. Average hourly pay surged 10 cents an hour last month to an average of $25.92, the government reported Friday. That's 2.8 percent higher than it was a year ago, the sharpest 12-month increase since 2009. The job market appears much healthier now, a sign that the plodding seven-year recovery is now providing some critical relief for workers. ___ Wal-Mart sets environmental plan as people seek green items NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart is laying out its environmental map for the next several years as it tries to satisfy customers who want green products at affordable prices. The world's largest retailer says it will seek to reduce emissions in its own operations by 18 percent by 2025, and work toward adding no waste to landfills in key markets like Canada and the United States. It also plans to be powered by 50 percent clean and renewable energy sources. Wal-Mart's goals, announced Friday by CEO Doug McMillon, follow a plan set in 2005 as the company sought to deflect criticism of its practices and burnish its image. ___ S&P 500 index marks its longest losing streak in 36 years NEW YORK (AP) — The slow, steady retreat of the stock market ahead of the 2016 election continued Friday, with the market falling for a ninth straight day. Wall Street is now in its longest period of decline in more than three decades. Investors continue to focus on the U.S. presidential election, which has become too close for comfort for some investors and has put the market on the defensive. The last time the S&P 500 fell for nine straight days is December 1980, nearly 36 years ago. Ronald Reagan wasn't even president yet. ___ US trade deficit in September at lowest level in 19 months WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. trade deficit fell in September to the lowest level in 19 months as demand for U.S.-made airplanes and other exports increased while imports slipped. The politically sensitive deficit with China declined. The deficit narrowed to $36.4 billion in September, down 9.9 percent from August, the Commerce Department said Friday. It was the lowest imbalance since February 2015. The latest report offers American manufacturers an encouraging sign that the problems caused by overseas weakness and a rising dollar were beginning to wane. ___ Samsung, after phone recall, recalls 3M washing machines Nearly 3 million Samsung washing machines are being recalled in the U.S. following multiple injuries — including a broken jaw — due to "excessive vibration." Samsung is the South Korean company that last month was forced to recall millions of its of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones after batteries inside began to overheat and catch fire. Safety officials cited 733 reports of malfunctioning, top-loading washing machines and nine injuries, including the broken jaw and an injured shoulder. The recall Friday affects 34 models of washing machines manufactured between 2011 and this year. ___ Buffett's firm's 3Q profit drops 24 pct on investments value OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Berkshire Hathaway Inc. reported a 24 percent drop in third-quarter profit on Friday because last year's results were helped by a huge paper gain on the value of its Kraft Heinz Food Co. stake. The conglomerate billionaire Warren Buffett leads posted solid results at most of the more than 90 companies it owns as it reported net income of $7.2 billion, or $4,379 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's down from $9.43 billion, or $5,737 per A share, a year ago when it recorded a $4.4 billion after-tax gain after Kraft and Heinz merged. ___ Icahn takes an even larger stake in Herbalife NEW YORK (AP) — Billionaire Carl Icahn is extending a years-long proxy fight with co-billionaire Bill Ackman, upping his stake in Herbalife yet again. The two have been battling over the legitimacy of the supplements and weight loss company since 2012, when Ackman called Herbalife a pyramid scheme and revealed a massive bet against it. A regulatory filing this week shows that Icahn upped the stakes again, pushing his ownership from 20.8 percent, up to 23.1 percent. He's the California company's biggest stakeholder. At $54.70 per share, Icahn put another $100 million plus into Herbalife on Thursday. ___ EU Commission holds up DuPont-Dow merger review WASHINGTON (AP) — The EU Commission reviewing the proposed merger of agriculture and chemicals companies DuPont Co. and Dow Chemical has put its work on hold as it waits for more information from the companies. The commission in August had expressed concern it could harm competition in the crop protection, seeds and petrochemicals sectors. DuPont and Dow agreed to merge in December in an all-stock deal then valued at about $62 billion. Shareholders for DuPont and Dow approved the merger in July. A Dow spokesperson said the Midland, Michigan company expects the merger to be completed in the first quarter of 2017, pending regulatory approvals. ___ UK's May seeks to keep Brexit plan going despite setback LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Theresa May sought Friday to reassure European Union leaders that her timetable for Britain to leave the EU remains intact despite a court ruling requiring British lawmakers to have more of a say in the process. She telephoned Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU's top official, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to say her plan is still to start the process to remove Britain from the EU by the end of March. Officials say she will also call French President Francois Hollande and European Council President Donald Tusk. In Berlin, British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson said the court ruling should not interfere with the government's Brexit timetable. ___ Egypt devalues, floats its currency, meeting key IMF demand CAIRO (AP) — Egypt on Thursday took the unprecedented step of floating its currency and later hiked fuel prices, meeting key demands by the International Monetary Fund under a $12 billion loan agreement to overhaul the ailing economy of the most populous Arab state. The floatation, accompanied by a 48 percent devaluation of the Egyptian pound, is the boldest economic measure taken by President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi since his election in 2014. El-Sissi has often asserted that tough times lie ahead as the country struggles with an array of economic woes, from double-digit inflation to unemployment and an acute foreign currency shortage. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 42.39 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,888.28. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 3.48 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,085.18. The Nasdaq composite lost 12.04 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,046.37. Benchmark U.S. crude oil lost 59 cents to $44.07 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, declined 77 cents to $45.58 a barrel in London. Heating oil fell 3 cents to $1.43 a gallon, wholesale gasoline fell 4.5 cents to $1.38 a gallon and natural gas futures fell less than 1 cent to $2.767 per 1,000 cubic feet.

A man whose homicide conviction was overturned in a case profiled in the Netflix series "Making a Murderer" could be celebrating Thanksgiving at home with his family in Wisconsin after a judge Monday ordered him released...More >    By JIM O'CONNELL AP Basketball Writer It's pretty safe to say that as soon as Kris Jenkins' 3-pointer made Villanova a national champion, somebody predicted what the 2017 NCAA Tournament bracket would look like. Waiting until the start of the season doesn't seem to be too smart of an idea either, but what the heck? Here's one man's early predictions for March Madness, which is four months and approximately 10,500 games away. This won't be a line-by-line breakdown, but rather a cut-and-run look at what might happen. EARLY ROUNDS: The first question always is, will a 16 seed beat a No. 1 for the first time? Not this season. There just doesn't seem to be any champions from the low Division I conferences that can pull the monumental upset. Watch Texas Southern of the Southwestern Athletic Conference be the one that scares a tournament favorite. There has to be a No. 12 beating a 5 (it's not in the rule book, but close) and this year's dandy dozen will be Princeton. The Tigers are a veteran team that should emerge from the Ivy League and then ruin the tournament for a possible 5 seed like Rhode Island. The other could be No. 12 Belmont of the Ohio Valley Conference against a Big 12 team like Texas. For those fans of close seedings, the 8-9 games are always entertaining and usually close. Four 8-9 winners could be Notre Dame, Iowa State, San Diego State and Colorado. Of those four winners, watch for Notre Dame and Iowa State to knock off No. 1 seeds Kansas and Villanova, meaning no repeat champion. REGIONAL ROUNDS: Having sent two No. 1s home early, it will be Duke and North Carolina carrying on the mantle for the favorites. The No. 2 seeds in Kansas and Villanova's brackets are Oregon and Kentucky and they move on to the regional finals where they both lose, the Ducks to West Virginia and the Wildcats to Louisville in the most-hyped game of the tournament and one that is the epitome of an intrastate rivalry. Duke and North Carolina knock off No. 4 seeds UCLA and Michigan State to reach the Final Four as No. 1 seeds. It's Wisconsin and Virginia moving on to the Final Four with the wins over Oregon and Kentucky. FINAL FOUR: Despite the pleas of many, the Final Four will be held in Glendale, Arizona, rather than moving it to Tobacco Road for the Blue Devils against the Tar Heels. Virginia, which gives the Atlantic Coast Conference three teams in the national semifinals, beats Wisconsin in a defensive battle. Duke finds a way to beat the Tar Heels, with the freshmen playing a huge role for Mike Krzyzewski. An all-ACC matchup between Duke and Virginia goes to the Blue Devils, title No. 7 for Coach K.

They told her they had a warrant for her arrest. It was 2007, and months prior, Pinyard wrote a bad check to purchase groceries at Walmart. “I was young, and I was stupid. I was trying to feed my family,” she said. "Was I wrong? Yes. But am I still wrong? No.” Pinyard spent the night in jail and was later found guilty of felony grand theft and sentenced to 1½ year's probation. Fast forward 10 years, and Pinyard is still paying for her crime. She's among 1.7 million people who’ve been permanently stripped of their voting rights due to a felony conviction, according to the Washington, D.C.-based Sentencing Project. No other state makes it harder to get rights restored — it takes years, and only a fraction of clemency applications are granted. NAPLES DAILY NEWS 2016 Poll Tracker - USA TODAY In a state like Florida where elections are decided by the smallest of margins, the consequences could be huge for both parties. The new registrations could lead to voters who could push either party's candidate over in a tight race. Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton are virtually tied in Florida polls leading up to Election Day, so every vote will matter. NAPLES DAILY NEWS Elections 2016 | Naples Daily News Florida's election history is rich with races that have been decided by a small number. In 2000, Al Gore's loss to George W. Bush by 537 votes decided the presidency. Even in 2012, President Barack Obama scraped past former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney by just 74,309 votes. Gov. Rick Scott won his two elections by just over 60,000 votes each. “This election, more than any other election, it means something,” said Pinyard, 40, of Ocala. With a son and two young daughters, one of whom's autistic, she said she’s worried about how they’d fare growing up under a President Trump whose rhetoric she finds offensive. “The fact that I have a choice here and I could make a difference, it irritates me. It really, really irritates me. I have a birth-given right to vote, and it’s being taken away from me.” Criminal disenfranchisement laws across the U.S.  (Photo: Courtesy of the Brennan Center for Justice) Related link: See an interactive map showing disenfranchisement laws across the United States. Florida's history of limiting the civil rights of felons is rooted in the state's constitution, written after the Civil War. Scott rewrote the rules surrounding clemency after taking office in 2011, making Florida the toughest state in the country for felons to regain their voting rights. Scott argues the clemency process should be part of a felon’s rehabilitation. He says it takes time for people to prove they’ve changed. “We want people to turn their lives around, and if you have, come before the clemency board and show that you did,” he told the Daily News. The majority of states allow felons to vote once they’ve completed their prison sentence, parole or probation. Maine, Vermont and Puerto Rico let people vote while in prison. Florida, Iowa and Kentucky are the only states that require felons to apply to have their rights restored. Iowa and Kentucky, however, are far more lenient. From 2011-15, 93 percent of clemency applications in Iowa and 86 percent in Kentucky were approved, according to each state’s governor’s office. During that same time period in Florida, 8 percent, or 2,014, were approved. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who serves on the clemency board, is a strong proponent of Scott's policy. "Out of fairness to law abiding citizens and victims of crime, the Attorney General does not support automatic restoration of civil rights without some type of review," Bondi's press office wrote in a statement. NAPLES DAILY NEWS Federal judge OK with how Florida is registering voters The power to reinstate civil rights to felons is vested in Florida’s clemency board, made up of Scott and three Cabinet members — Bondi, Commissioner of Agriculture & Consumer Services Adam Putnam and Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater. To grant restoration of civil rights, the governor must agree with two Cabinet members; however, the governor has the sole power to deny clemency. Restoration of civil rights includes the right to vote, sit on a jury, hold public office and take the Florida bar. Restoration of the right to possess a firearm is a separate form of clemency that requires a different application. So few felons have had their rights restored during Scott's term that others have stopped applying. Requests for restoration of civil rights under Scott have decreased by nearly 95 percent from former Gov. Charlie Crist's administration, according to data from the Florida Commission on Offender Review, the state agency that administers clemency applications. During Crist's term, 384,786 clemency applications were received, while just 22,161 felons applied during Scott's first term. The number of applications continued to fall off in 2014 and 2015, with just over 2,000 each year, according to agency records. Buy Photo Applications for restoration of civil rights in Florida from 2011 to 2015.  (Photo: Naples Daily News) Florida is the only state where felons must wait an additional five to seven years after completing their sentence, which includes parole and probation, before they’re eligible to apply to have their rights restored. Offenders must be crime-free during those years, and the application is tedious. Felons must obtain certified copies of the charging document, judgment and sentence for each of their felony convictions, which can be extremely difficult for people whose crimes were committed decades ago. Once submitted, the application takes several years to process. Offenders who have committed more serious crimes must travel to Tallahassee for an in-person hearing before the clemency board. If rejected, applicants must wait two years before reapplying. Shorter applications led to more requests for clemency in Iowa. Applications there nearly doubled after the state reduced the number of questions by more than half in April, according to data from the Iowa governor's office. While Iowa saw spikes in applications during election years, requests for clemency in the past few months have increased more than in prior election years before the application had been streamlined. For felons seeking clemency in Florida, it hasn’t always been this tough. Crist restored civil rights to 155,000 felons during his four-year term, and Republican Jeb Bush granted nearly 77,000 felons clemency during his eight years as Florida governor. As of Oct. 5, Scott had restored voting rights to 2,339 felons. Under Crist the civil rights of nonviolent felons who had completed all conditions of their sentence — including satisfying parole, probation, court fees, and victim restitution requirements — were automatically restored. Of the 155,000 felons who were granted clemency under Crist, 25 percent registered to vote in the 2012 general election, according to a study conducted by University of Pennsylvania professor Marc Meredith and Harvard doctoral candidate Michael Morse. The researchers matched felon clemency data to voter files to find 59 percent registered as Democrats, 18 percent registered as Republicans and 23 percent as independent or third party. Crist, a Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat, claims when he championed the automatic restoration of civil rights for felons while running for governor as a Republican in 2006, then-GOP Attorney General Bill McCollum and other party leaders called to express disappointment over his decision. “They thought it would open a floodgate to the Democratic vote, and they didn’t want that,” said Crist, who is running for a St. Petersburg-based congressional seat as a Democrat. McCollum denies the allegations, saying that, though he disagrees with automatic restoration of civil rights, his stance has nothing to do with politics. When Scott took office in 2011, he created an application process for felons, set a five- to seven-year waiting period to apply and required applicants to obtain certified court documents. Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, said it was somewhat unexpected when Scott and Bondi “immediately took a reflex tough on crime position” and reversed Crist’s policy. “He had never articulated there was a problem with the policy Crist had set up,” Mauer said. Orlando resident Desmond Meade leads Floridians for a Fair Democracy and is president of the felon assistance group Florida Rights Restoration Coalition. He said felons struggle with enough issues, including housing and employment, as they try to reintegrate into society. Scott is creating another barrier by making it more difficult to obtain their fundamental right of citizenship — the right to vote. “Once a person has a stake in their community, they’re going to become and remain a contributing member of society,” Meade said. Meade, who served time for a series of drug possession crimes in the early 2000s, said he was denied clemency for failing to meet the waiting period requirements and was too “disheartened” to reapply. “The more inclusive democracy is the more vibrant democracy,” he said. “I should not have to leave the state to enjoy citizenship, not in 2016.” He and other ex-offenders point to Tuesday's high-stakes election, stressing that their votes, more than ever, deserve to be counted. Buy Photo Fort Myers resident Neil Volz, right, gathered signatures for a ballot initiative at a Donald Trump rally at the Collier County Fairgrounds on Oct. 23, 2016. The initiative would place the issue of felon voting on the ballot in 2018. Volz was involved in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal in 2005 for which he was charged with criminal conspiracy and sentenced to two years’ probation.  (Photo: Annika Hammerschlag/Naples Daily News) “I’m such a big believer in this experiment we call self-government, and not to be involved is one of the tougher things for me to embrace and accept as I continue to move forward with my life,” said Neil Volz, the former chief of staff to Congressman Bob Ney, R-Ohio. Volz was involved in the 2005 Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal, for which he was charged with criminal conspiracy and sentenced to two years’ probation. “I made a bunch of stupid, selfish decisions, and I accept the consequences,” he said. But the fact he continues to pay for his decisions nearly two decades later, he says, isn’t right. Volz, who now lives in Fort Myers, works for a local nonprofit that helps homeless people and in his free time volunteers with Meade for the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition. Volz, who applied for clemency in 2011 and hasn’t heard back, has been collecting signatures for a referendum that would put the issue of felon voting on the ballot for 2018. Any future changes are too late for Pinyard, the Ocala mother who served her time for a bad check. She applied to have her rights restored in 2011 after Scott changed the rules to require her and other nonviolent felons to wait five years after completing their probation. The waiting period rendered Pinyard’s application ineligible, and she was denied. As Election Day nears, she feels helpless, she said. “I just hope someone up there wakes up and realizes that people make mistakes. But people do change,” she said. “We have a voice, and our voice counts too.” Daily News staff writers Alex Glorioso and Arek Sarkissian contributed reporting to this story.  113 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://nplsne.ws/2f2iC1o TOP VIDEOS Daily Scoop for Nov. 14, 2016 1:21 Beach erosion threatens the economy of Cape San Blas 2:52 Kristallnacht 1:48 Veterans play softball against Seacrest Country Day School 0:47 Anti-Trump March and Protest in downtown Miami 0:58 Fiance waits for WWII soldier's return 2:57 Veterans enjoy their day with free food at Bob Evans 0:52 Behind the Headlines: Cures for political hangover 25:30 Coming up on Sunday’s Behind the Headlines 1:10 Funeral for Damian Creed 0:57 More Stories No first cut: 11 applicants for Florida high court move on Nov. 14, 2016, 11:45 a.m. Deputies: Small plane crashes in the Everglades Nov. 14, 2016, 11:36 a.m. Brightest moon in almost 69 years lights up sky around globe Nov. 14, 2016, 11:35 a.m. LAPD says it won't change its deportation policies under Trump Nov. 14, 2016, 7:59 p.m.

The comedian has forgiven Kevin Roper, the Walmart truck driver who caused a massive accident in the summer 2014 that seriously injured Morgan and killed his comic friend James McNair. “I forgave him, and I’m not even mad at him no more,” Morgan said on Thursday’s episode of “Conan.” In the spring of 2015, Morgan settled his lawsuit with the mega company saying, “Walmart did right by me and my family, and for my associates and their families.” Fellow comedian Damon Wayans claims Morgan got $90 million in his settlement. Ever the ready for the punchline, Morgan, 47, added to Conan O’Brien, “But you know who is mad at him? All my white neighbors.” Morgan imagined his neighbors saying, “’If you wouldn’t have hit his ass, he wouldn’t be living next door to me!’” Now with a few extra dollars in his account, Morgan is sure to drive his Lamborghini slowly, at 30 miles per hour, through his neighborhood. “They ain’t never seen a black motherf—ker in a Lamborghini,” he laughed. Roper, who had been up for 28 straight hours leading to the fatal crash, pled not guilty to aggravated manslaughter, vehicular homicide and aggravated assault in February 2016. The defense and prosecution are expected to meet in court again on Nov. 9.

MORE >> Tracy Morgan dropped by Conan O’Brien’s late-night talk show where discussed his tour bus’s collision with a Walmart tractor trailer in 2014 that injured him and claimed the life of his friend James McNair, stating that he’s ready to forgive and more on. “I forgave him,” the 47-year-old actor said. “I’m not even made at him no more, but you know who is mad at him? All my white neighbors.” Morgan explained that, after his near-fatal accident, he decided to move and, according to him, his new neighbors aren’t thrilled about his arrival. “If you wouldn’t have hit his ass, he wouldn’t be living next door to me!” he joked from the perspective of the residents who live near him. 12 Controversial Comedians: Daniel Tosh, Kathy Griffin and More 12 Photos » After the highly-publicized accident, Morgan received a settlement from Walmart in 2015.

When O’Brien asked how fast he goes in in his new sports car, Morgan replied: “30 miles per hour, so everybody in the neighborhood can see it. They ain’t never seen a black motherfucker in a Lamborghini.” “I don’t do speed,” Morgan told the cheering audience. “Speed is for kids.” Check out the clip above.

The shareholder, among the company’s 10 biggest, raised its concerns in recent meetings with activist investment funds after losing patience with the company’s direction, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the process is private. The investor cited Whole Foods’ poor inventory and vendor management, high costs and failure to make the most of its unique appeal to millennial shoppers among the key issues. Several activist investors, who asked not to be named, said they are aware of the shareholder’s suggestions and are studying Whole Foods carefully. It’s unclear if any has begun accumulating a position in the Austin, Texas-based company, which has a market value of about $8.9 billion. “Whole Foods Market values the strong and open relationships we have with our shareholders,” Brooke Buchanan, a spokeswoman for the company, said in an e-mail Friday. “As discussed on Wednesday’s earnings call, we are focused on pursuing the right strategies to position the company to produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the long term.” Shares of Whole Foods rose 2.7 percent to $29.22 at 12:42 p.m. in New York after being temporarily halted. The stock has suffered a steep decline, falling by half from a 2015 high of $57.20. The company said Wednesday it will end its longstanding practice of having dual chief executive officers, naming co-founder and co-CEO John Mackey to serve as sole CEO starting Dec. 31. Larger mainstream grocers, including Kroger Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., continue to advance on Whole Foods’ organic turf, weighing on sales. Kroger has a market value of about $29 billion and Wal-Mart is valued at about $214 billion. Whole Foods is trying to fight back by offering more discounts and starting a new chain aimed at younger shoppers. Organic products have become widely available at U.S. stores, often at lower prices than Whole Foods offers. Food deflation hasn’t helped the company, as other retailers slash prices amid falling costs for items like beef and eggs. Whole Foods has said its new chain, called 365, will add to 1,200 conventional stores it already plans to build. That forecast was issued in 2013, shortly after the stock reached its all-time high of $65.24. Analysts have since questioned whether there’s capacity for more high-end organic grocers in the U.S. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Bob Rupcich of Bailey Court had compiled a 19-page report citing alleged violations of the city of Princeton Land Development Code with Breck Loos of Sterling wanting to use a portion of the building for warehousing and distribution plus retail usage for another part of the vacant area of the store. A petition signed by 22 residents objected to the special use permit to warehousing in a district right next to a residential area. "While we do support new retail operations in the now vacant real estate, we believe that the proposed warehousing operation and their associated disruptions would be detrimental to the R1A residential abutting area," the petition said. Rupcich cited the neighbors' major concerns as declining property values, alteration of the essential character of the neighborhood, adverse noise from running diesel trucks during unloading/loading process, vehicle vibration from trucks being felt at nearby homes, fork lift noise due to OSHA mandated backup alarms, unknown operating hours, inadequate screening (six-foot fence required), intrusive lighting from security lights on the back of the building, intrusive security surveillance possibly intruding on residents' privacy, and west side of building used by trucks getting to loading docks due to the building only being 30 feet from their property lines. Other factors cited were outside storage, refuse containers and odors, proposed outside compactor, storm water drainage, litter and safety. Jim Lund, a nearby resident who runs a trucking company, said semis can't safely back in or pull out of the proposed 12-foot-wide docks. Resident Charlie Yelm said storm drainage pipe used for the current building has eroded and buckled, and he was concerned with more water problems with the area being paved for use by trucks. Rupcich said warehousing is an inappropriate use of this area, and the city shouldn't be held hostage if he said he would leave without the variance being granted. "We support retail and the city, but this is a wrong operation for this area," he said. Resident Greg Malm added, "We wish him well, but somewhere else." Comment on this story at www.bcrnews.com.

Two years ago, Tracy Morgan almost lost his life in a car accident with a Walmart tractor-trailer. His friend, comedian James McNair, was killed in the June 2014 limo-bus crash on the New Jersey Turnpike. Morgan spent two weeks in a coma and still has scars on his head from the deadly incident. But Morgan says he's made peace with the driver who caused the collision. In an interview with Conan O'Brien, Morgan said, “I forgave him and I’m not even mad at him no more." But, he joked, "You know who is mad at him? All my white neighbors." Morgan said the reported $10 million settlement he received from Walmart helped him move to a nicer neighborhood, where he drives around in his Lamborghini. He never goes more than 30 mph, though, so he can show it off. "If you wouldn’t have hit his ass, he wouldn’t be living next door to me," Morgan joked, imagining what his neighbors might say. “I’ve got daughters.” According to CBS New York, the driver of the Walmart truck, Kevin Roper, pleaded not guilty in February 2016 to aggravated manslaughter, vehicular homicide, and aggravated assault. He is currently awaiting trial. Advertisement Entertainment • News • Pop Culture Photo: Kristina Bumphrey/StarPix/REX/Shutterstock.

Morgan once again spoke candidly about the traffic collision which left him in a coma and took the life of his friend and fellow comedian, James "Jimmy Mack" McNair, all while imbuing the tragedy with his reliable sense of humor.

"I forgave him and I'm not even mad at him anymore," Morgan told the cheering Conan audience. "But you know who is mad at him? All my white neighbors! 'You wouldn't have hit his ass, he wouldn't be living next door to me! I got daughters!'" A new favorite pastime for Morgan is to slowly cruise around his fresh neighborhood in his Lamborghini, generally maintaining a speed of "30 miles per hours so everybody in the neighborhood can see it." Morgan is currently preparing for Lee Daniels and Jay Z's forthcoming Richard Pryor biopic Is It Something I Said. During a chat with the Breakfast Club crew last month, Morgan opened up about the extensive creative process behind capturing the spirit of Red Foxx with an honest portrayal: "I'm not trying to do an impression," Morgan said at the time. "I'm trying to channel him. Just like Jamie [Foxx] did with Ray. He didn't do an impression. He did Ray on heroin. That's a dark place. You wanna go until you know how to get to that dark place."

WMT, -1.04% said it plans to double the sales of locally-grown produce by 2025, expand its sustainable sourcing of 20 commodities including bananas and coffee, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions as part of the new commitments in its sustainability agenda. Wal-Mart's Chief Executive Doug McMillon will lay out the plan at the Net Impact Conference taking place on Friday. The retailer's goal is for an 18% emissions reduction in its own operation by 2025, a plan approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, which is aligned with the Paris Climate Agreement. It will also work with suppliers to reduce emissions by one gigaton by 2030, the equivalent of taking more than 211 million cars off U.S. roads, the company said. Other goals include reducing packaging waste, achieving zero waste to landfills in key markets by 2025, and working with partners to ensure ethical treatment of workers across the supply chain. Wal-Mart shares are inactive in premarket trading, and up 13.6% for the year so far. The S&P 500 INdex SPX, -0.01% is up 2.2% for 2016 so far.

He was up before dawn and standing at the head of the line at the WalMart store front that shall be the Tigers. He beat all comers to the Left Fielder aisle.Shopping hard. Nordstrom next? by Stirrups Nov 4, 2016, 4:00am PDT tweet share pin Rec Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images I was a busy boy yesterday. I had three customer meetings, two conference calls, and took two trips into the office to get email and paperwork completed in between. 7:15AM to 6:45PM. And all throughout the day, no matter where I went or with whom I was was working, no matter business, lunch or commute, every time I became a part of a group of at least three people the conversation instantly turned to Game 7. For the most part these were all people I have seen and worked with for nearly ten years. Never have I had this happen where everybody talks about The Big Championship Game of the day before. A couple of NFL Super Bowls came close. But to drag those games down, there was that obnoxious snark of superiority out of every third person as to how they only watched for the commercials. And, to be honest, even Super Bowl commercials are no longer the national event they were a few years ago. It's never happened to me with any NHL Stanley Cup. It only approximated yesterday with the NBA Finals when the Lakers won, and when I was working downtown LA. But still that was mostly among the slightly more sports-minded people. Yesterday it was everybody. Even people who would come right out and clearly confess that they didn't know sports very well. But that was OK, they would say, because they were with me and I knew a lot about baseball. Apparently, I had their back, and they could freely swim with the rest of us in the delight of Game 7 excitement. That all makes sense now that I know that this Game 7 kicked absolute ass in the overnight ratings. It was THE most watched baseball game in 25 years. Over 40 million viewers. Now, to be clear, I am not sure how they count all those eyeballs in a global live streaming epoch, but 40 million people is roughly the combined population of half of America. (This list, from Oklahoma to Wyoming which would be 24 States, adds up to 43.7million.).......... Things will be quiet among all these people when Monday rolls around. But not here, friends. Not here at all. Welcome To The Off-Season Links: ______________________________ Let's Get Organized A new season has started. We have some important dates to track. Here is our calendar of events for the rest of this year: 11/5: Contract Options decision day 11/7: Final day for teams to extend Qualifying Offer. This year it's $17.2million 11/7: Finalists for the big-time 2016 awards are announced 11/8 - 11/10: GM Meetings in Scottsdale, Arizona 11/8: Free Agency period begins 11/8: Gold Glove winners announced 11/10: Silver Slugger winners announced 11/14: Deadline to accept/reject Qualifying Offers 11/14: Rookies of the Year award winners announced 11/15: Managers of the Year award winners announced 11/16: Cy Young award winners announced 11/17: Mike Trout overlooked yet again for AL MVP Award 11/18: Rule 5 Draft protection deadline 12/1: Current CBA expires 12/2: Deadline for teams to tender pre-arb and arb contract offers 12/5 - 12/8: MLB Winter meetings in Washington, D.C. 12/8: Rule 5 draft ______________________________ World Series Hangover Joe Maddon is not perfect, and his tinkering in Games 6 & & opened the door for the dinosaurs to show their teeth. But he is still the smartest guy in the room. And to think, he was our to lose, and lose him we did........... You can stop feeling sorry for Cleveland fans immediately. And you can start reminding Cubs fans that just because their team won a World Series, that doesn't mean they can let their guard down and start trusting everybody to do the right thing............ These lovable loser Cubs are such a monster that not only did they deliver on what everybody expected them to do all along, but they are already 3/1 favorites to do it again next year............. Yeah. This is the bottom of the 9th that had me mesmerized. The gassed Aroldis Chapman was practically daring the Indians lineup to walk off with the title. It was more pitching than overpowering. The Indians had that World Series right there for the taking, and missed it. The Cubs absolutely stole that frame, right out from under the noses of Cleveland.......... I'm sure there are 1000 such stories about Cubs fans. This is the one we will go with............I'm sure there is only one of these stories about Cubs pllayers. So I cannot do anything but go with it. Ben Zobrist is a cool dude, as are his fans.............. What next for Steve Bartman? Now may you rest, forever and in peace, Harry Caray, Budweiser has put in the time to make you whole.............. ______________________________ A Little Bit of Angels News Did you hear? The Angels kicked off the off-season for all of MLB by acquiring Tigers' outfielder Cameron Maybin. You did hear, right? Yeah? No? well, welcome back to planet earth, then. I mean, with only World Series new to report, the Maybin acquisition was the top fresh news everywhere. Hey, it ain't Willie Mays, but the bar was pretty low out there in left field. Not only is Maybin an upgrade over the 2,816 guys we have experimented with since dumping Hambone off onto Texas, he is an upgrade over what would have been Hambone, too, had we kept him to this age...........As FanGraphs puts it, "this move is simply wonderful"............ Brett Oberholtzer, who had been DFA'd, has been outrighted to Salt Lake City. Still in the organization. Have a Happy Thanksgiving and a very Merry Christmas, Oberholtzer family. And Brett? Yeah, you. Have a Do-It-Better New Year............ ______________________________ Trade Winds Maybin was a good catch because the Tigers are looking to retool, and Epstein absolutely beat other team to the punch here. It was like his own personal Black Friday rush to the electronics aisle, when everybody else was still indulging in tryptophan-induced couch dreams. One guy that won't be getting out of Detroit is the significant bullpen upgrade option that is Francisco Rodriguez. His ERA+ of 128 last season was better than anything on the entire qualifying LAA pitching staff............ Here is your full roster of possible Free Agents this winter. Not all these dudes will make it all the way to market.............. Theo Epstein, when he recovers from his hangover, has the toughest job in all of baseball. His team is adored. They are indulged. They are, pardon the sickeningly over-used cliche, family. They are the Big Beast of Baseball, fulfilling the destiny ordained on them from before anything even started. So does Epstein stand pat, forcing all the other GM's to try and catch him? Or does he work to improve his weakest roster spots, which would mean kicking off the bus some guys that are national heroes today, riding int he parade? Theo won. Big. But now he wakes to a no-win situation of his own making........... The Phillies declined their option on Ryan Howard. I'm shocked............ Dexter Fowler has already announced that he is stepping off that Cubs bus I keep talking about, and looking at Free Agency. But he is more than open to hiring back on with Chicago...for a raise, of course. I know that you have probably forgotten the Fowler backstory, what with all that has happened since last October.

Motion chairs are just one of the promises so-called 4D technology will bring to Canadian cinemas this summer when movie exhibitor Cineplex opens its first 4DX auditorium. THE CANADIAN PRESS/ THE CANADIAN PRESS Share Adjust Comment Print Here’s our roundup of the best and brightest stories this morning. Walmart, le superstore: Sign laws to ensure trademarks comply with Quebec’s “linguistic landscape” go into effect Nov. 24, the Office québécois de la langue française says. The rules will allow businesses to keep their trademark names, even in English, but requires them to add a descriptor in French – not necessarily next to the name but somewhere that is visible, according to the OQLF. The Office will provide assistance to companies needing guidance to implement the new rules. They aren’t expecting outrage, which probably means they haven’t met some of our Facebook commenters. Cuts pretty deep: Bagpiper Jeff McCarthy was perplexed and perturbed when he was handed a $221 ticket by police for wearing a sgian-dubh (pronounced skin-do), a small knife that is a common accessory for men in traditional Scottish dress. The piper was cornered, then ticketed by officers who spotted the knife tucked into his kilt hose while he was taking a break during a McGill University convocation ceremony. “As I was walking by these three police officers, one of them … asked me, ‘Is that a knife?’ and I said, ‘Absolutely’.” McCarthy hasn’t decided whether he will contest the ticket, which amounted to about half his salary that day. Oh god, please hold the bubbles: Canada’s largest movie exhibitor is launching a pricey new ticket option: an immersive moviegoing experience called 4DX. Cineplex is screening Marvel’s Doctor Strange in the new format, which includes motion seats and an array of environmental effects — including rain, wind, lightning, snow, scents and bubbles — to correspond with appropriate sequences. Adult admission is $24.99. For now, Canadians can only get this experience in Toronto. Okay, now we’re outraged: Canadian courses for Trump University were taught by a couple who used aliases, declared multiple bankruptcies, lost a real-estate licence and was sanctioned by securities regulators over a multimillion-dollar swindle, according to documents reviewed through a joint investigation by CP and AP. They taught Trump courses in Canadian cities in 2010, before Trump’s namesake real-estate seminars folded amid mounting inquiries from U.S. regulators and complaints from former students. Trump assured customers he had personally hand-picked only the best people to teach. Trump University staff included at least four felons, including a cocaine-trafficker and a former army sergeant court-martialled for sexually assaulting a fellow soldier’s eight-year-old daughter.

Comedian Tracy Morgan has forgiven the truck driver who nearly killed him. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments The 47-year-old star was left seriously injured in June, 2014 after a Walmart truck crashed into the comedian's vehicle in New Jersey, killing comedy writer James 'Jimmy Mack' McNair. Tracy suffered severe brain trauma and a broken leg, among many other injuries, and had to learn how to walk again during his months-long rehabilitation. But the former 30 Rock comedian has now put the traumatic incident behind him, insisting during an appearance on late night chat show Conan on Thursday (03Nov16) that he doesn't hold a grudge against the driver of the truck. "I forgave him," Tracy insisted. "I'm not even mad at him no more." However, Tracy added that his neighbours might not be as forgiving, joking: "But you know who is mad at him? All my white neighbours. 'If you wouldn't have hit his a*s, he wouldn’t be living next door to me!''' Tracy and Walmart executives reached a financial settlement over the collision back in 2015. While the exact amount the comedian received is unknown, it was enough for him to splash out on a new house and a Lamborghini. Revealing he drives the swanky vehicle at 30 miles an hour "so everybody in the neighbourhood" can see him, Tracy added: "I don't do speed. Speed is for kids." Tracy previously admitted that while he has little memory of the crash, he does remember meeting his late father while comatose in a New Jersey hospital. "When you're in a coma for eight to 10 days you're basically knocking on the door (of heaven)," he said in a taped interview for Oprah Winfrey's Master Class TV special. "I don't know if I was in the coma, or in and out of the coma, but I remember I was just talking to my dad. "He had this green thing on and I just remember him saying, 'I'm not ready for you son'. And I started crying so hard. I was crying harder than probably I cried at the funeral. And I just kept saying, 'Dad!' because he was my best friend." © Cover Media Online Editors Your Comments COMMENT RULES: Comments that are judged to be defamatory, abusive or in bad taste are not acceptable and contributors who consistently fall below certain criteria will be permanently blacklisted.

Tracy Morgan Doesn't Hold A Grudge Against Driver Who Nearly Killed Him By WENN in Movies / TV / Theatre on 04 November 2016 Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest StumbleUpon Reddit Fark Email Comment Follow Tracy Morgan Tracy Morgan Oprah Winfrey Comedian Tracy Morgan has forgiven the truck driver who nearly killed him. The 47-year-old star was left seriously injured in June, 2014 after a Walmart truck crashed into the comedian's vehicle in New Jersey, killing comedy writer James 'Jimmy MACk' MCNair. Tracy suffered severe brain trauma and a broken leg, among many other injuries, and had to learn how to walk again during his months-long rehabilitation. But the former 30 Rock comedian has now put the traumatic incident behind him, insisting during an appearance on late night chat show Conan on Thursday (03Nov16) that he doesn't hold a grudge against the driver of the truck. "I forgave him," Tracy insisted. "I'm not even mad at him no more." However, Tracy added that his neighbours might not be as forgiving, joking: "But you know who is mad at him? All my white neighbours. 'If you wouldn't have hit his a*s, he wouldn’t be living next door to me!''' Tracy and Walmart executives reached a financial settlement over the collision back in 2015. While the exact amount the comedian received is unknown, it was enough for him to splash out on a new house and a Lamborghini. Revealing he drives the swanky vehicle at 30 miles an hour "so everybody in the neighbourhood" can see him, Tracy added: "I don't do speed. Speed is for kids." Tracy previously admitted that while he has little memory of the crash, he does remember meeting his late father while comatose in a New Jersey hospital. "When you're in a coma for eight to 10 days you're basically knocking on the door (of heaven)," he said in a taped interview for Oprah Winfrey's Master Class TV special. "I don't know if I was in the coma, or in and out of the coma, but I remember I was just talking to my dad. "He had this green thing on and I just remember him saying, 'I'm not ready for you son'. And I started crying so hard. I was crying harder than probably I cried at the funeral. And I just kept saying, 'Dad!' because he was my best friend."

Photo: Courtesy of the New York Comedy Festival A little more than two years after narrowly escaping death in a horrific six-vehicle crash on the New Jersey Turnpike, comedian Tracy Morgan sits in the living room of his $13.9 million mansion in tony Alpine, NJ. He plays with his giggling 3-year-old daughter, Maven Sonae, and exudes a kind of soulfulness that rarely informs his bombastic stand-up routine. “The accident gave me a different perspective on life,” he softly says over the phone. “It would have done the same for you.” Tracy Morgan with his daughter, Maven, and wife, Megan, last year at the Primetime Emmys in Los Angeles.Photo: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP Morgan, 47, is not just alive, but truly thriving. His career has shot into overdrive: He appeared with Conan O’Brien at the Apollo this week, has projects galore on his slate, and will headline a New York Comedy Festival show at Carnegie Hall on Saturday night. The comic has denied reports he got a $90 million legal settlement for the accident from Walmart, whose truck slammed into Morgan’s limo. In a statement in May 2015, he said, “Walmart did right by me and my family, and for my associates and their families. I am grateful that the case was resolved amicably.” Morgan — who was in a coma for eight days and feared he’d never walk properly again — attributes his remarkable comeback to personal rather than professional motivations: “I wanted to be well enough to play with my daughter when she got older, to see my sons grow, to see my wife grow. Those things were on my brain. They focused me on getting healthy.” (Morgan has three grown sons with his first wife. His daughter, Maven, is with current wife Megan Wollover.) While he has upcoming film roles (“Fist Fight,” “Tag”), Morgan’s current big project is a TBS sitcom featuring Jordan Peele as co-writer and executive producer. On the as-yet-untitled show, which has been shooting on location in Brooklyn, Morgan plays an ex-con returning from a 15-year prison stretch and adjusting to life in his newly gentrified neighborhood. He says the crash gave him greater clarity in his creative process. “I was sitting around after the accident with ideas and visions, things coming back to me, my brain rebooting,” Morgan says. “A lot of the show is based on my life in New York City. Stories I have known, lives I have seen that touched me. The idea was there before the accident, but [surviving] the accident gives me a second chance.” Morgan poses at Madison Square Garden in January.Photo: Anthony Causi He gets to reminiscing about inner-city New York — he describes himself as being from “Brooklyn, by way of The Bronx” — during a grim time. “I’m from the ’80s generation,” says Morgan. “Crack and AIDS destroyed a whole generation of people. They went away to prison for making easy money by selling crack, or else they went away by dying of AIDS. I am from the missing generation.” He quickly drops the crack-era talk and pauses the interview so he can wrangle his chattering daughter. One can almost see his smile — the one made famous when he played an exaggerated version of himself on “30 Rock” — through the phone line. He talks about the excitement of appearing on “Conan” during the talk-show host’s stint at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. It’s his first time on that historic stage since his 2010 HBO stand-up special. ‘I wanted to be well enough to play with my daughter when she got older, to see my sons grow, to see my wife grow.’ “I got my start on 125th Street. It was at Uptown Comedy Club” — where Morgan and other up-and-coming comedians would engage in epic freestyling put-down battles — “and [I’ve] traveled millions of miles in comedy and showbiz. But it’s always good to come home.” Morgan is all too aware of how close he came to never coming home again. However, bad as things had been for him — his wife, Megan, recently told Essence magazine, “I look back on [the post-accident period] like a movie or a nightmare” — he swears that he won’t shy away from mining the experience for laughs. “Listen,” he says in his throaty, booming voice, “if you don’t laugh about it, you cry about it. But that’s what I built my career on, Richard Pryor-style, taking all the bad things in my life and making them funny.” Like when he made a surprise appearance at the 2015 Primetime Emmys and quipped about emerging from the coma and being “ecstatic to learn I wasn’t the one who messed up!” Morgan acknowledges that nearly losing his life helped his comedy, even before he made a single crack about high-speed collisions on New Jersey highways. “It gave me something to talk about. It gave me something to think about,” he says, leaving the impression that maybe he had begun taking his comedic talents too much for granted. “It’s like with a girlfriend. You ignore her for a long time, then you see her with another man and you get more into her. I’m paying closer attention. I’m more into detail.” Still, when it comes to spinning the crash into comic gold, even a man as outrageously humorous as Morgan may have his work cut out for him. “I had nightmares, as any human would, but they were not accident nightmares. I don’t remember the accident,” he says. “They were dreams about Jimmy [Morgan’s frequent collaborator, James McNair, who died in the collision], childhood, my dad. You go through a traumatic brain injury and your life passes before you. Trust me on that.” With the end of the allotted interview time at hand, Morgan puts in a heartfelt request. “Do me a favor,” he says. “Tell the people of New York City that I love them.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under comedians ,  jordan peele ,  new york comedy festival ,  tracy morgan Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Beyoncé makes surprise appearance at Country Music Awards Read Next Beyoncé makes surprise appearance at Country Music Awards Most Popular This Week 1 The one scenario that could still get Hillary into the White House 2 Melania Trump's girl-on-girl photos from racy shoot revealed 3 Assassination threats against Trump flood Twitter 4 Man who fatally punched stranger surrenders 5 Trump calls slain cop's widow to offer condolences 6 White House open to a Clinton pardon Share Selection Trending Now on NYPost.com 52,348 Sanders says it's not Comey's fault that Clinton lost 41,917 'I came here to kill you': Cop-killer stalked family for days 29,389 Read John Lennon's harsh words for Paul McCartney Now On You can hire DJ Khaled for your next big shindig Ryan Reynolds had a ‘nervous breakdown’ after ‘Deadpool’ Donald Trump had better not cross Jane Lynch SEE ALL Video You can hire DJ Khaled for your next big shindig Now On John Oliver Has A Complete Meltdown Over Trump Election Results SEE ALL More Stories pagesix Read John Lennon's harsh words for Paul McCartney Now On Decider Alec Baldwin Is A No Show On 'SNL', Backs Down From Trump nypost Sanders says it's not Comey's fault that Clinton lost New York Post Twitter Facebook Instagram Email Newsletters Mobile Apps Contact Us Tips Twitter Facebook Instagram Sections & Features News Real Estate Page Six Tech Sports Media Metro Photos Entertainment Video Business Alexa Opinion Covers Fashion Horoscopes Living Classifieds Newsletters & Feeds Email Newsletters RSS Feeds NYPost Store Home Delivery Subscribe Manage Subscription Preferences Help/Support Customer Service App FAQ & Help Contact Us Tips Newsroom Letters to the Editor Reprints Careers Apps iPhone App iPad App Android Phone Android Tablet Advertise Media Kit Contact Post Digital Network © 2016 NYP Holdings, Inc.

But hey, that's not to say that a hefty settlement payment didn't contribute to Morgan's charitable mood. As Morgan explained on Thursday's Conan, while he isn't mad at that Walmart driver, you know who is? "All my white neighbors." But that sure as heck doesn't stop Morgan from driving around his new, ritzy neighborhood, all deliberate like, in his cool, fancy Ferrari. After all, the man's got a new lease on life and he's not going to miss a chance to milk it.

All my white neighbors.” Amid audience laughter, Morgan summons mock anger: “If you hadn’t hit his ass, he wouldn’t be living next door to me!” The 30 Rock and Saturday Night Live alum also tells O’Brien that since relocating his home, he’s been enjoying leisurely rides in his Lamborghini. Asked how fast he drives, Morgan replies, “30 miles an hour, so everybody in the neighborhood can see.” Morgan has been steadily returning to the public eye since his June 2014 accident, which occurred when a truck struck his limousine van from behind on the New Jersey turnpike. The crash killed Morgan’s friend and mentor James “Jimmy Mack” McNair, left Morgan in a coma, and seriously injured three other passengers. Morgan settled a lawsuit against Walmart in May 2015 and first returned to the stand-up stage a year ago. He is currently on tour, has a role in the upcoming movie Fist Fight, and is working on an FX comedy pilot with Jordan Peele.

The event, which takes place at 220 Broad St., will run from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. A second event is planned from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 3  at  Wal-Mart, 2024 Genesee St. in Oneida. The event will be conducted by the Sheriff’s Office along with the City of Oneida Police Department, and is made possible by the support of the Oneida Wal-Mart. Also available at the event will be various informational items geared toward child safety and safety concerns in general, available at no charge. Madison County Sheriff Allen Riley explains that using equipment that contains the latest digital fingerprinting technology and high-resolution photography capabilities, many Sheriff's Offices across New York are able to produce a SAFE CHILD card for parents and guardians. The card contains the child’s name, biographical information (including date of birth, gender, height, weight, hair color, eye color, and other identifying data), and a fingerprint image of both index fingers. The card can be made in just a few minutes and can be easily carried in a wallet or pocketbook. The goal of the program is to record and securely store the fingerprints, basic biographical information and photographs of children who are not missing — information critical to expediting the return of a missing child. The storage of information is secure, entirely voluntary and requires the written consent of a parent or legal guardian. The information gathered is digitally recorded and stored at a separate database at the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS). Once included in the database, parents or lawful guardians can request that information be purged at any time and, after a child turns 18, the fingerprints will be purged from the database. The child's photo should be updated once a year.   About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Contact Us Subscriber Services Classifieds Submit Announcements & News Market Place Classifieds Real Estate Your Community News Blotters Herkimer County Oneida-Verona New Hartford Rome Utica Oneida Indian Nation Whitestown Blogs - Living - Sports Sports: Anne Delaney Sports: John Pitarresi Sports: Ron Moshier Boilermaker College Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

SWEET HOME CHICAGO: Chicago's spectacular skyline. Once there was Hope. Now there’s Park Ridge. “Hillgrimages” are as popular as “Billgrimages”. The party faithful and the compulsive-obsessive Instagrammers and Snapchatters stretch their selfie sticks as far as they will go and take photos of themselves under the “Rodham Corner” sign at the intersection of Wisner Street and Elm in Cook County, Illinois. READ NEXT Travel digest with Barry Couglan They pull faces outside “The Wonk’s House” in Park Ridge, an upper middle-class but not very quiet suburb about 10 miles north-west of downtown Chicago, under the approach path to the city’s O’Hare Airport. Park Ridge is a significant if not sacred neighbourhood. It is where Harrison Ford grew up. It is also the childhood home of the wife of the 42nd President and the only First Lady to be subpoenaed and fingerprinted by the FBI.  The first First Lady of the United States to have a postgraduate degree from Yale.  The first woman to be elected as a US Senator and the first Grammy-winning Democratic Party Presidential nominee who is a US Marine reject, a frustrated astronaut, a former Alaskan cannery fish descaler, a self-described “Rorschach Test” and the daughter of a fabric store owner and homemaker. As well as an ex-Republican. Hillary Rodham Carter Clinton campaigned for Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater in 1964.  The Vietnam War, the Civil Rights movement (particularly the speeches of Martin Luther King) and her opinion that the Richard Nixon campaign against Nelson Rockefeller included “veiled racism” prompted Hillary Clinton to leave the Republican party in 1968. She worked in the Carter Administration. Bill Clinton put Arkansas on the map. Hillary too. They have made it a tourist destination. Pre-Clintons, Arkansas was backwater, rural Nowheresville. You didn’t run for public office. You ran for the state line. Prior to the Clintons, the most famous thing to have been born and to grow up in Arkansas was the world’s biggest-ever watermelon. All 255lbs of it. Before Bill and Hillary, all Arkansas could boast was producing more broiler chickens and less rocket scientists per capita than any other US state. So short of homegrown attractions was Arkansas that its official brochure actually boasted of having milk as its state beverage as well as some of North America’s prettiest sedge. The state now boasts a bauxite museum, the birthplace of “Walmart”(Bentonville) and, at the eastern edge of the state, Johnny Cash’s boyhood home at 4791 West Country Road, Dryess. But Arkansas’ biggest draw and tourist revenue magnet is the “Clinton Heritage Trail” featuring Bill-and-Hillary related places of interest.  The fairytale story of Hempsted County’s favourite son began in 1946. The ex-President’s actual birthplace, the Julia Chester Hospital on south Main Street in Hope, is no longer there which says much for his much-vaunted healthcare programme. It is now a funeral home which says even more. His two boyhood homes at 117 S. Hervey (where he lived from 1946-1950) and 321 W.13th are major landmarks and tourist must-sees. Busloads of fans visit them every day. South Hervey features a replica of an Oval Room rug. In Hope you can visit the graves of Bill’s parents and grandparents, Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who looked after him after his father died in a car crash and before his mother married Roger Clinton, a local car dealer. The Clinton Route (affectionally known by some as the “Clinton Teen Boy Trail” ) takes you to “National Historic Sites”, scenes of keynote speeches, momentous soundbites, extraordinary feats of gladhanding and self-indulgent saxophone solos. It takes you to his old schools, the Park Place Baptist Church where he was baptised and on to 1011 Park Avenue, Hot Springs where he moved at the age of eight.  You can visit “Bathhouse Row” and the 1924 “Arlington Hotel” where he had his junior and senior proms. Al Capone holidayed there in the 1930s. After Yale (Connecticut), where he met Hillary, William Jefferson Blyth Clinton became professor of law at Fayetteville in his home state where Hillary, graduating from Yale in 1973, also got a job in the prestigious “Rose” law firm.  You can stroll the University of Arkansas campus and Waterman Hall where they courted. You can visit the “D-lux Café” ( now “36 Club Uber”) where the couple are meant to have engaged in energetic discussions about the future of the world and volubly cared about the world. There are many park benches where they might have once sat. For only $8 admission, you can snap yourself in front of a replica of Hillary’s wedding dress in their first home on 930 West Clinton (formerly California Boulevard) , a 1930 Tudor Revival bungalow where they married on October 11, 1975. The Clinton Home Museum’s phone number is 877-BIL- N-HIL. The museum also a First Ladies Rose Garden to which Bill might soon be making a contribution of his favourite cultivar. There are also homes on L and Midland Streets. The end of Arkansas’s “Billhillgrimage” love-in visitor attraction experience is the state capital and Little Rock’s 1950 Georgian-Colonial Governor’s Mansion where he was governor for 12 years.  He was first elected at the age of 32. It used to be an institute for the blind. Tours can be arranged. To see the buildings Louis XV1 chandeliers, silver from the USS Arkansas and a 1770 Waterford grandfather or “cabinet” clock. The Old State House is where Bill announced his bid for the presidency in 1991 and delivered his acceptance speeches in 1992 and 1996. The 1908 Arkansas Gazette Building served as his campaign headquarters during the 1992 presidential election. There are gift shops everywhere. The best-selling T-shirt in fishing-mad Arkansas (“The Natural State”) is still “The Best Way To A Man’s Heart Is Through His Fly”. There is also a museum. Or rather Little Rock’s huge “ William J. Clinton Presidential Centre and Library” which chronicles the couple’s extraordinary “ life of service”. It contains his beloved “Cadillac One” car, intimate photos of the family’s pets and a Valentine’s message from Hillary. There is also a reconstruction of the White House’s Oval Room. The Clintons have an apartment above the library overlooking the river and the Clinton Presidential Park Bridge. Illinois boasts the home of Ohio-born Ulysses S. Grant in Galena and Ronald Reagan’s childhood home in Dixon, as well as Lincoln’s house in Springfield and Barack Obama’s senator’s mansion on South Greenwood Drive, which is inaccessible to the public. A popular Obama place of worship is his old hairdressers, “The Hyde Park Hair Salon” on the University of Chicago campus, as well as restaurants like the “Valois Diner”, “R.J.Grunt’s” and “Spiaggia”. Not to be undone by Arkansas, “The Land of Lincoln” now has its own leg of the “Clinton Trail” starting at Hillary’s nativity site of the now abandoned Edgwater Hospital at 5700 N.Ashland Avenue. The Windy City’s Hillary tours take in her former family two-storey home (sold in 1987) at 235 Wisner which she shared with younger brothers Hugh and Anthony.  And her schools — the Eugene Field Elementary School at 707 Wisner, Maine East School on W. Dempster (where, years earlier, fellow Oak Ridger Harrison Ford was the first sports announcer on its student radio station) and Main South High —where Hillary the wonk (swot) was voted “most likely to succeed”; and where she began her social justice activism”, organising a babysitting group to look after the children of migrant Mexican workers in rural Illinois. The tours tell you that Hillary used to sometimes come to class in the ninth grade wearing her Girl Scout uniform. There is also Prospect Avenue’s 1928 Art Deco“Pickwick Theatre” movie palace. Sadly, despite Hillary’s ringing endorsements and schmaltzy memories of its onion rings and burgers, her favourite “Pickwick Restaurant” next door has closed. Hillary accepted the post of Secretary of State from President-elect Obama at the Chicago Hilton. She attended the private, all-women, liberal-arts Wellesley College in Massachusetts. This is where she worked on her political agendas in and she made her famous “breakout” militant commencement speech on behalf of the Class of ’69 and the youth of the Western world. Contemporaries remember a young lady who knew where she wanted to go and how she wanted to get there and what it would take.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     McDonald's Offers Online Ordering Posted: Nov 5 2016, 6:30pm CDT | by Noel Diem, in News | Latest Business News   Photo Credit: Getty Images   McDonald's is FINALLY getting into the mobile ordering and paying market, meaning that customers will be able to use their smartphones to order and pay for food, which will streamline the process, according to Business Insider. How To: Find Hatchimals In Stock You won't be able to use this until next year, when people in the US, Australia, France, Canada, and the UK will be able to use it at some 25,000 restaurant locations. Mobile ordering has helped many fast food restaurants with their traffic, though McDonald's has been lagging behind. Starbucks, in particular, has had huge success. It will benefit the chains, the workers, and the customers because it will improve accuracy, speed up serving times, and can even offer up specials. McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook has been planning on mobile ordering for a long time so that people can order when they want and know when they can expect their order to be finished. It has been tested in almost two dozen locations in Georgia. When Starbucks launched their mobile ordering, 25% of customers have picked up on it to pay and 6% use it to pay ahead. In high traffic times, that makes everything easier. Even without mobile ordering, McDonald's has 14 million app downloads, which has offered up some great information to the company. This app could do the same, and make it easier to help with staffing.

Faith Hill Surgery New Miranda Lambert Song Scotty McCreery New Music Billy Gilman Travis Tritt Beyonce Rant Alan Jackson Releases ‘Precious Memories’ Gospel Collection By Laura McClellan November 5, 2016 6:00 PM SHARE TWEET EMAIL EMAIL REDDIT Rick Diamond, Getty Images Alan Jackson has released a special collection of his gospel tunes for the upcoming holiday season. Titled Precious Memories Collection, the project includes songs from his Precious Memories album from 2006 and 2013’s Precious Memories II, as well as a couple of new originals. The collection is available exclusively at Walmart. The original tunes were inspired by Jackson’s wife, Denise, who is the author of an inspirational book titled It’s All About Him. Jackson says he wrote the song “It’s All About Him” to try to enhance the spirit of what she wrote. “Inspired by Denise’s strength and ability [in writing her book], I sat down and wrote a song of the same title hoping to add musically to an already uplifting story,” Jackson explains in a press release. The second original song is titled “That’s The Way,” which is a song special to the couple, as Jackson sang it to his wife on their wedding day. The first Precious Memories project was originally conceived as a gift to family and friends from Jackson, but upon receiving the thoughtful gift, the recipients encouraged Jackson to release it publicly. Though no singles were released from the album, it was still certified Platinum by the RIAA. The 28-track Precious Memories Collection is now available at Walmart. Jackson recently teamed up with Chris Young to provide a guest vocal on Young’s version of “There’s a New Kid in Town” on Young’s new record, It Must Be Christmas. The tune is an original song Jackson recorded for his first holiday album, Honky Tonk Christmas, in 1993 as a duet with Keith Whitley, who also co-wrote it.

Thor Jensen 11.05.2016 :: 12:00PM EST kthorjensen Stay on target Sega Mega Drive goes mini, the pint-sized, retro console wars are here 11 franchises that should ripoff Pokemon Go Of all the video game mascot characters, none inspires the fanatical devotion that Sega’s quick-footed blue hedgehog does. Nobody ever maced a Gamestop employee because they changed the color of Mario’s arms, nobody ever started a Change.org petition because they changed Crash Bandicoot’s voice actor, nobody ever bombed a Wal-Mart because there was never a fourth Gex game. But Sonic fans are deeply into their character. And when you have love, you have fan art. The Internet is home to literally millions of drawings of video game characters in all kinds of situations, and probably half of them involve Sonic in some way. If you tried to download every hedgehog on DeviantArt, you’d need a hard drive the size of a Sega Saturn to hold them all. Sonic fan art is a very big deal, and a lot of it is pretty freaking weird. We went on a deep dive through the worlds of Twitter, Tumblr, and DeviantArt to dredge up some Sonic art that gave us all kinds of dark feelings. Page through the slideshow below if you dare and feel free to paste your own favorite examples into the comments, which we will never read because we value our sanity. Gotta go fast! View as: One Page Slides 1. Sonic The Feedee One of the things you'll notice right away is that Sonic fans love to blend the blue hedgehog with all kinds of other fetishes. In this example, Tails is the "feeder" working diligently to help Sonic get big with the aid of chili dogs. 2. Shadow Stripping Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic's genetically engineered dark mirror, is the subject of a fair amount of fan art. He's often positioned as a more sexually adventurous figure, the top to Sonic's bottom. I wonder if using a stripper pole charges up your Spin Dash? 3. Cyborg Sonic A big genre of Sonic fan art is "OC"s, or "original characters" - new anthropomorphic animals that fit into the video game universe. Most of these OCs are just clumsily re-colored versions of Sonic, Tails and the like, but some go flat-out nutty with the cyborg parts and such, 4. Sonic Lion King Recoloring existing art is a big deal in the fan art community, as is blending two media properties together. Case in point: this deeply weird and clumsy Sonic / Lion King mash-up, which hurts the eyes to look at. 5. Shadow Praying Religious Sonic fan art is another rich vein of weirdness. This one depicts Shadow and a Chao, both ludicrously muscled and packing some serious heat in their Speedos, taking a prayer break. 6. Chili Dogs It's probably fair to say that at least some bad Sonic fan art is made ironically, as a joke. But think about this: we started this gallery with Tails feeding an obese Sonic chili dogs, and now we have another chili dog related image. There's obviously something deeper going on here that we don't have enough Chaos Emeralds to understand. 7. Sonic Shoes Meal As you'd expect from a character who runs a lot, there is a disturbingly huge amount of Sonic foot fetish material out there. This odd piece of art mixes in a little humiliation and food into the mix, with the poor tan OC forced to eat dinner out of Sonic's toe cracks. 8. Sonic Gap Style Drawing Sonic characters as more traditional anime protagonists is a pretty popular thing, especially if you're a horny teenager. One of the best things about this drawing is the Transformers-style power bars for their stats, revealing that neither hedgehog could make a saving throw vs. Sadness. 9. Take My Blood What do you do after you've created your Sonic OCs? Why, tell melodramatic adventures with them in MS Paint, of course. This panel from what I'm sure is a thousand-page epic is notable for lots of things: hedgehog boobs, pants but no shirt, exposed belly button. But my favorite is the smear of turquoise used to represent tears. 10. Realistic Sonic Some of the most upsetting Sonic fan art is where people take the low-detail cartoony style of the franchise and try to render things in a more realistic way. This here is a nightmare straight from the Upsidedown, with Sonic's rippling muscles only outdone by Tails' slavering face. 11. Tails Digesting If you haven't been keeping up on your fetishes, you might not have heard of "vore." In brief, it's when you get off from the idea of being swallowed up and digested by another living thing. Needless to say, Sonic fandom is chock full of vore art, like this pic of Sonic and (presumably) the artist. 12. Weird 3D Vore Sticking with the vore tip, we have an ineptly rendered 3D tableau featuring Amy Rose choking down some sort of cat with big titties as Sonic holds her belly admiringly. The blue guy looks a little off-model to me. 13. Sonic Crucified Here's another religious tableau featuring Sonic nailed to a cross like Jesus in front of an approving audience of Link and Pikachu. The delicate black and white shading really lends an air of seriousness to it. 14. Bloody Pageviews The sexual relationship between Sonic and Shadow is one that is explored across myriad pieces of art. I'm not 100% sure what's happening here: Sonic appears to be pregnant, and also feeding Shadow from her wrists with blood because Shadow is a vampire as well as a hedgehog. Cool stuff. 15. Real Sonic What If Sonic And Eggman Were In Real World? We think it'd look a little something like this, and also the police would probably be called. 16. Sonic Nipples For a lot of these fan artists, playing Sonic video games isn't enough. They want to hang out with the speedy hedgehog and his pals in the real world. That's how you get masterpieces like this, where a poor dude with three nipples has a very awkward pool party with Sonic and a buxom (and possibly bloody?) Amy Rose. 17. Sonic Simpsons Why exactly somebody felt the need to recast the Simpsons as Sonic characters (or is it the other way around) is completely beyond me. I think Maggie probably comes out of this one the worst. 18. Mike The Hedgehog 9-11 There is a lot of Sonic 9-11 art. Like an insane amount. We could have done an entire gallery of Sonic 9-11 tributes but I didn't want to get too morbid. Special appearance here by OC "Mike The Hedgehog," who is basically Sonic but green. 19. Buff Sonic Buff Sonic We typically think of Sonic as a lean, mean running machine, but some people like to draw him rippling with muscle. We can't see this dude being able to pull loop-de-loops with this build. 20. Sonic Urinals Okay, we're stepping into the dark world now. Abandon all hope, ye who would enter here. Sonic, Tails and Knuckles have been transformed into urinals and they can't wait for you to fill their gaping mouths with hot piss. 21. Sonic Condoms Sure, let's draw Knuckles, Sonic and Tails as condoms. Why not. What possible downside would there be to doing this? 22. Sonic Suicide The idea of a suicide pact between Amy Rose and Sonic is something that we'd never even thought to consider. What really makes this difficult to deal with is the contrast between their expressions - Amy's cheerful acceptance of death juxtaposed with Sonic's creeping fear. 23. Sonic Toilet That's it. I'm done. Peace out. I'll see you in the bleach tank.

How a single Internet provider could end up making money off you several times over The Washington Post 11/5/2016 Brian Fung Click to expand Replay Video Bond market reels over $1 trillion loss from 'Trump thump' Donald Trump's shocking victory for the White House may end the more than 30-year-old bull run in bonds. According to Reuters, that's because bets on faster U.S. growth and inflation are leading investors to favor stocks over bonds. A two-day thumping wiped out more than $1 trillion across global bond markets worldwide, on bets that plans under a Trump administration would boost business investments and spending while firing up inflation. It was the worst rout in nearly 1-1/2 years.

Although regulators could challenge the acquisition or slap conditions on it that may limit how AT&T can use its new assets, the purchase hints at a future where a single company can monetize the same customer multiple times over, just through the customer's routine use of the Internet. Quotes in the article AT&T Inc T ▼ 36.13 -0.38 -1.04% Time Warner Inc TWX = 86.80 0.00 0.00% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 70.49 -0.74 -1.04% Best Buy Co Inc BBY ▲ 39.94 +1.58 +4.12% Other Internet providers have made stabs at building this kind of business model. Verizon, for example, wants to do something similar with Yahoo and AOL. But if AT&T succeeds — and that's still a big if — it will be that much closer to turning its subscribers into virtual cash machines, going to them over and over to grow its revenue base. Here are a few ways that could work. Sell connectivity At its core, AT&T is a network company. Its main job until now has been to sell you access to communications, such as phone or Internet service. These services act as conduits to the information or media you can find once you're hooked as a subscriber. This business model is not going away. In fact, it is what allows all the other business models to follow. It is also the easiest to describe, because selling data plans is the most directly observable way in which AT&T makes money from consumers like you and me. Sell content  On top of selling you the network, companies such as AT&T increasingly want to sell you the content that travels over those networks — including shows like “Game of Thrones” or “Westworld.” Historically, these types of shows were only available on cable TV. But thanks to the Internet, accessing this content just becomes a matter of network capacity. And guess who does networks? AT&T. Because AT&T's merger with Time Warner could allow the telecom giant to control HBO's entire content catalogue, any money the premium channel makes could belong, ultimately, to AT&T. That includes the $15-a-month subscription fee that HBO charges for its Internet streaming app, HBO Now. HBO has been called the “crown jewel” of Time Warner, and AT&T knows it. Suppose you're an AT&T Wireless subscriber and you pay for HBO Now. In the wake of a successful merger with Time Warner, this would allow AT&T to double-dip into your wallet. Sell advertising This is the big one. Advertising, particularly of the targeted variety, forms the cornerstone of the entire Internet economy. And Internet providers want a big slice of it. To compete with other ad heavyweights like Google and Facebook, Internet providers need to collect and use behavioral data. That means analyzing your browsing history, your app usage history, your location history, your financial information and other data that can help build a picture of who you are as a consumer. And since your Internet provider is collecting a lot of this information anyway simply to provide the basic function of getting you where you want to go on the Internet, its perspective is, why not use that data for advertising? Armed with these insights, a company, such as AT&T, could approach a company, such as Walmart or Best Buy, and say, “I can reach this demographic for you. Do you want to advertise with us?” And if Walmart or Best Buy said yes, they could put their ads on any number of sites or channels owned by AT&T. As a result of the Time Warner merger, that could include platforms, such as TBS or CNN. Targeted ads promise to “feature prominently” and in some cases represent “the whole ball of wax” for telecom companies in the new digital economy, according to Craig Moffett, an industry analyst at MoffettNathanson. Things get even more intricate from here. Not only could the ads be targeted to a specific demographic, but thanks to a technique known as cross-screen advertising, a particular customer could see the same ad on their TVs that they do on their phones and their tablets. AT&T's tests show that cross-screen advertising can boost a company's sales by as much as 87 percent. If ads are about repeated messaging, this approach may be the purest — and most lucrative — form of it yet. Federal regulators voted last week to limit how Internet providers can use your data, in a victory for privacy advocates. Still, many consumers may voluntarily opt in to the advertising, particularly if they're offered financial incentives in exchange.'© Barta IV Sell your data A company, such as AT&T, could put your data to work for its own advertising business. But it could also benefit by sharing your data with marketing firms and other third parties who can use that information themselves. Data brokers who traffic in behavioral insights are often invisible to the average consumer, but what they know about you can affect your choices, such as the types of credit you're offered. A network company with deep insights on its subscribers could sell the data to a third party. All of these different business models entail monetizing different aspects of the customer relationship. Under the right circumstances, a telecom company could theoretically use a customer as a cash machine by: 1. Selling her a mobile data plan 2. Convincing her to pay for premium content on top of that plan 3. Watching how the customer engages with that content 4. Showing them ads tailored to her engagement 5. Selling that engagement data to third parties That doesn't even begin to contemplate any potential cross-promotions or special bundles of content and service designed to lure even more customers into the ecosystem. Nor does it go into possible licensing deals with other businesses that could allow, for example, AT&T to charge other firms for the use of DC Comics' intellectual property, such as Batman or Superman. The upshot is that by melding content and distribution, telecom and cable companies likely envision a whole constellation of business models that may form the foundation for a new digital economy, one that orbits largely around them.

(Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg) Published November 05. 2016 11:15AM | Updated November 05. 2016 8:22PM By Lauren Coleman-Lochner, Bloomberg What’s in your jeans? A rogue’s gallery of unpronounceable chemicals whose effects on humans are suspect. Perfluorochemicals, phthalates and azo dyes are among the substances that are widespread in making clothes. Under pressure from consumers demanding safer alternatives to harmful chemicals, American companies including Levi Strauss & Co. are taking a more European approach. The European Union has banned or restricted more than 1,000 chemicals; the U.S. has banned or restricted fewer than 50. Consumer demand for safe products has global companies scrambling for greener ingredients, but obstacles are daunting. Suppliers are often reluctant to share their formulations, buyers balk at higher costs, and in some cases cost-effective safer substitutes simply aren’t available. Levi’s has prohibited certain chemicals since 2000, but this is different. The jeans maker and other companies are asking suppliers to use materials generated from bacteria, fungus, yeast and methane gas to replace the petroleum-based substances that make up more than 95 percent of U.S. products’ inventory of chemicals. There are plenty of incentives to change. A Pike Research report estimates that the global market for green chemistry will increase to almost $100 billion by 2020, from $11 billion last year. Millennials are overwhelmingly interested in sustainable investing, according to Morgan Stanley. And innovating can give companies a competitive advantage, said Monica Becker, co-director of the Green Chemistry and Commerce Council, which works with companies including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Companies can make false promises that a product is consistent with green-chemistry practices, Becker said, but guarding against that are assessment methods used by the Environmental Protection Agency’s Safer Choice program. Rules can also confound the efforts of U.S. companies. To approve chemicals and processes, the European Union uses a so-called hazard-based approach that the Chinese government is also considering. Manufacturers need to prove their products meet safety standards before they bring them to market. The U.S. method is risk-based. It involves weighing metrics, such as quantity and duration of exposure, to assess the danger in an existing product — if data exist. Proponents of a hazard-based approach argue that exposure to even tiny amounts of some chemicals correlate with learning disabilities, asthma, allergies and cancer. “Shouldn’t it be that chemicals are guilty until research proves them innocent?” said Amy Ziff, founder and executive director of Made Safe, a new hazard-based certification program. Levi’s said its goal is to use only chemicals that pass hazard-based screens by 2020. Even as some suppliers push back, “we wouldn’t give up on hazard-based,” said Bart Sights, Levi’s director of global development. Levi’s already uses some green methods to make its signature blue jeans. To give them a worn look, Levi’s uses an enzyme derived from fungus and tumbles the jeans in ozone gas instead of bleach — a process that Sights estimated has had the added benefit of saving the company a billion gallons of water in the past three years. “Some companies are spending the same amount on environmental compliance as they are on research and development,” said John Warner, president and chief technology officer of Warner Babcock Institute for Green Chemistry, who created the first green-chemistry Ph.D. program in the U.S., at the University of Massachusetts at Boston. Companies can be roiled by the use of non-green chemicals. Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc. was beset by lawsuits last year after a “60 Minutes” investigation said it used unsafe levels of formaldehyde. Shares plunged before a government probe ended without a product recall. The company no longer sells the flooring. Such problems have investors taking notice, said Mark Rossi, whose company, Clean Production Action, created the Chemical Footprint, modeled on the carbon footprint, that investors can use to measure risk and costs. It also developed and licenses a chemical-screening method used by Levi’s and others. Rossi has signed on firms including BNP Paribas, Calvert Investments and Trillium Asset Management, while companies like Johnson & Johnson and Clorox Co. participated in the first survey to assess their footprint. Gojo Industries Inc., maker of Purell hand sanitizer, has pledged to cut its chemical footprint in half by 2020. In the five years since it launched a campaign to spur clothing makers and sellers to get rid of toxic substances, Greenpeace International has signed on 78 brands, said Kirsten Brodde, head of the organization’s Detox My Fashion campaign. At the Berkeley Center for Green Chemistry, across the Bay Bridge from Levi’s San Francisco headquarters, students have worked with the jeans maker and companies such as outfitter Patagonia Inc., office-furniture maker Steelcase Inc. and Mango Materials Inc., which manufactures plastics out of methane gas, to develop safer materials, including a non-toxic resin for Autodesk’s 3D printers. But an overnight change for the greener just isn’t possible. “When it comes to materials, we’re at the very initial step, which is figuring out what the heck is actually in our products,” said Marty Mulvihill, a founder of the Berkeley Center and its former executive director. “A lot of companies are just completing that first step.” A comprehensive replacement for formaldehyde, for example, hasn’t been developed, Mulvihill said. Mulvihill is now a partner at Safer Made, a new venture-capital firm he co-founded that’s seeking investments in companies that use green chemistry. It’s looked at more than 100 companies, with plans to invest in 10 to 15 firms in the next five years, he said. Patagonia has also invested in green chemical companies. A Levi’s supplier, Beyond Surface Technologies, is one of a dozen the Ventura, Calif.-based clothing maker has seeded out of 1,400 prospects it’s looked at since 2013. “Ultimately, some of these companies that we fund could be able to help us clean up our own supply chain,” said Phil Graves, Patagonia’s director of corporate development. There are 20 environmentally friendly chemicals available for the company’s textile finishes, compared with 200 to 300 that contain non-green chemicals, said Matthias Foessel, Beyond Surface’s founder and chief executive officer. Developing safer alternatives can take years, while acceptable green substitutes for some substances used in waterproofing and stain protectants, such as perfluorocarbons, don’t exist, Foessel said. New chemicals often behave differently than expected. Beyond Surface had been trying to create a water repellent when it developed a fabric that absorbs sweat instead. Still, Foessel’s eight-year-old firm, based near Basel, Switzerland, now has more than 100 customers, including Adidas AG. “Ten years ago, people wouldn’t have even talked to us,” Foessel said. “People accepted that you had to use chemicals that pose a risk.” Workers make jeans in Parras, Mexico. Consumer demand for safe products has global companies scrambling for greener ingredients, but obstacles are daunting. (Susana Gonzalez/Bloomberg) Next Article Loading comment count...

(Source: Gerri Knight) Cameron MacLean, CTV Winnipeg Published Friday, November 4, 2016 4:09PM CST Last Updated Saturday, November 5, 2016 8:22AM CST A man who went missing from the Selkirk Mental Health Centre Thursday evening has returned safely. Brian Knight, 49, was reported missing around 8:15 p.m. Thursday. He returned to the centre around 3 a.m. Saturday. The hospital called Knight’s mother, who lives in Brandon, to let her know. Knight’s sister-in-law Gerri Knight told CTV News that he likely spent a lot of time in the McDonald’s at the Wal-Mart in Selkirk, not far from the RCMP Detachment and the centre. She said she believes spent the nights outside and they worried he would get hypothermia. Brian was cold, hungry and tired by the time he returned to the centre, she said. Brian’s disappearance worried the family because he has schizophrenia and had just moved into the centre from Brandon on Monday, she said. “We were really, really concerned that he was in this unfamiliar community. We didn’t know the choices he would make, and we knew that the community was not familiar with him,” she said. In Brandon, everyone knew to call police if they saw him on the street, she said. Gerri thanked members of the public who responded with tips and members of the media for reporting on the disappearance.

From left, Director Nina Senn, Director Roseann Torres, Director Aimee Sueko Eng, Vice President Jody London, Superintendent Antwan Wilson and President James Harris are pictured at a school board meeting Wednesday, Nov. 18, 2015. (Anda Chu/Bay Area News Group) By Joyce Tsai | jtsai@bayareanewsgroup.com PUBLISHED: November 5, 2016 at 7:00 am | UPDATED: November 5, 2016 at 5:22 pm OAKLAND — A deluge of pro-charter money that’s come into the Oakland Unified school board race has raised questions in the community over how much influence groups outside the city, including wealthy Wall Street and Silicon Valley donors, should have in the local election. More than $825,000 in independent expenditures have been poured into the local race, which boasts a dozen candidates running for four district seats. The vast majority has come from expenditure committees established by two pro-charter, education reform groups: Families and Educators for Public Education, established by GO Public Schools Oakland; and the Parent Teacher Alliance, run by the California Charter Schools Association. Their money has gone to support three candidates: James Harris, Huber Trenado and Jumoke Hinton Hodge. “I’m concerned that these people from outside of Oakland are having this disproportionate effect on our school board race,” said Ann Swinburn of Parents United for Public Schools. “Oakland parents, educators and our community have clear visions for the kind of strong public schools we want to have, and these folks from outside of Oakland are trying to usurp that decision.” Families and Educators has spent about $440,000 on the race so far, according to the Oakland City Clerk’s Office campaign disclosure website. The committee recently received a $300,000 donation from Wall Street billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and it has received more than $48,000 in donations from Silicon Valley investor Arthur Rock. The Parent Teacher Alliance so far has spent $395,000 on the race, according to the state Secretary of State’s Office campaign disclosure website. It has received millions of dollars from James and Alice Walton of Wal-Mart and Reed Hastings of Netflix, via the California Charter Schools Association Advocates, the political action arm of the CCSA. It’s this type of outside spending from big-money donors that makes it hard for grass-roots candidates to compete, Swinburn said. “They are running a very well-financed crop of candidates in this political campaign, with money from Wall Street and Silicon Valley billionaires, while we’re sitting here with 8 to 10 people trying to make phone calls from out of our homes,” Swinburn said. “It’s a very unbalanced equation, and the people who are going to lose out are the kids in Oakland.” However, candidate Harris said the critics’ emphasis on big money has been more about spreading “rumor and innuendo” than helping the kids of Oakland. “All the money in the campaign, it seems just another way to spread vitriol,” he said, adding that he has no control over what outside groups spend. The race has been especially heated in District 7, where Harris, a first-term incumbent, faces Chris Jackson, a former trustee of San Francisco City College. Jackson’s supporters have attacked Harris for having received more than $165,000 from the Parent Teacher Alliance and $60,000 from Families and Educators, while Harris supporters have railed against Jackson for owing $13,905 in fines and administrative penalties from campaign violations from three separate San Francisco Ethics Commission cases. To boost Hinton Hodge’s campaign in District 3, Families and Educators has spent about $35,000 and Parent Teacher Alliance has spent about $78,000. Hinton Hodge, who seeks her third term, bristled at the suggestion that candidates who have received PAC money are not running grass-roots campaigns. Her opponents in the race are Benjamin Lang, Lucky Narain and Kharyshi Wiginton. “I don’t know those (donors) personally, but what I understand is that those people want to make an investment in the transformation of education …,” she said of the affluent donors, “and they are another group of people who have similar values as I have around reforming the school. So I don’t rule out any of those things to try to improve things.” Trenado, a public school teacher, has received $43,000 from Families and Educators and $148,000 from the Parent Teacher Alliance. He is running in District 5 against incumbent Roseann Torres, as well as Michael Hassid and Michael Hutchinson. The tenor of the race has changed with all the slick mailers and ads, Torres said “Alas, now even a school board race has the toxicity of big-dollar campaign tactics,” she said. Trenado said that he’s far from the (wealthy) 1 percent he’s being associated with. “I have never met any of these millionaires,” he said on Facebook. “The idea that because they funded organizations that endorsed me I am now a sellout to corporate America is ridiculous.” Ash Solar, executive director of GO Public Schools, said that the unprecedented levels of spending this year are more a reflection of the fact that there’s been “a presidential election that has sucked all of the air in the room” and voters will be faced with one of longest state election ballots in history, and local school races are at the bottom of it. California Charter Schools Association Advocates spokesman Richard Garcia, said unions wield powerful endorsement and campaign clout and have spent much more money than his organization has statewide. “Just like unions have done for decades, we support our candidates because we believe they have the best interests of students in mind,” he said.

Surprisingly little, as it happens. For all the storm and fury of this most unpleasant of U.S. presidential campaigns, the two chief contenders are actually campaigning on common ground. The chief issues for both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are job creation, boosting economic growth, national security, and what they each regard as genuine free trade. A rupture in U.S.-Canada trade relations would be near-catastrophic for the U.S. The North American auto and livestock industries, to pick just two examples, are thoroughly integrated between the U.S. and Canada. New England gets most of its electric power from Quebec — something to keep in mind the next time you see the New York City skyline at night. That’s Canadian electricity lighting up Times Square and Broadway. The anti-trade rhetoric of the candidates for the U.S. presidency has obscured the fact that in seeking greater economic growth — the top goal for each candidate — the U.S. will have to become a more vigorous exporter. That means gaining greater access to world markets. And that, in turn, requires an even greater U.S. commitment to free trade than currently exists. Trump and Clinton have each expressed reservations about the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and they also vow not to proceed with the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the 12-country trading block of which Canada is a member. Yet either candidate, as president, will almost certainly leave NAFTA wholly or largely untouched, and will also lead America into a ratified TPP. Trump is a global entrepreneur. His business has long generated much of its profits outside the U.S. And Hillary Clinton was a Day One negotiator for America on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in her role as U.S. secretary of state. Stepping away from the TPP talks, on completing her tenure at State, Clinton declared that the not-yet-completed TPP is “the gold standard of trade agreements.” Why would each of these candidates flip-flop on free trade after becoming U.S. president? This space can highlight only some of the many compelling reasons: •Most of the low-skill, low-pay U.S. jobs that were vulnerable to offshoring have already been lost. And in the main, they haven’t been lost to America’s NAFTA partners Mexico and Canada. Most have been lost to China, South Korea, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Cambodia and other lower-cost jurisdictions with which the U.S. has no trade deals. They’ve also been lost from the U.S. Midwest to the world’s newest sweatshop, the low-pay, anti-union U.S. South. •Trump has all but declared a trade war with China. But no one wins in a trade war. Americans who can only afford to shop at Wal-Mart or Costco will find the shelves bare. And China’s retaliatory walls against U.S. imports would enrage CEOs of the Fortune 500, who would demand compensation for the damage Trump has done to their extensive Chinese investments. Given America’s current era of discontent, bashing the Chinese, Muslims and Mexicans might be a slam dunk in winning a presidential nomination. But doing so as president is profoundly contrary to America’s economic interests. •For the U.S. economy, there is tremendous upside potential in using the TPP to bulk up U.S. trade with America’s existing trading partners (TPP members Japan and Australia) and cracking new markets in the Pacific Rim (Malaysia, Vietnam, New Zealand) and Latin America (Chile, Peru, Colombia). America derives only about 20 per cent of its GDP from exports, pointing to a tremendous upside potential for the U.S. economy by becoming a more substantial exporter. Frankly, as a mature economy, America’s internal economic growth rate will be modest for decades to come. For America’s GDP to grow substantially, the U.S. simply must build up its export prowess. And that can be achieved only by embracing free trade. Clinton and Trump know this. And they have each been watering down their anti-trade talk as the election approaches. Trump regards himself as a superb negotiator, and relishes the chance to, as he has said, “negotiate the best trade deals ever.” But whether Trump or Clinton are able to improve much on what seven years of TPP negotiations have already yielded is beside the point. They’ve each revealed themselves as free traders, in stark contrast to what they’ve said on the campaign trail. •Strengthening NAFTA and recommitting to the TPP would enable the U.S., finally, to establish harmonious relations with a Latin America that, in the main, has felt nothing but the back of America’s hand for generations. •Free trade has been good for the U.S. In the six years after the U.S. joined Mexico and Canada in creating NAFTA in 1994, the U.S. created 23 million new jobs, a record that remains unsurpassed. And Canada has seen a whopping 173-per-cent increase in merchandise exports to the U.S. alone from 1994 to the present. As a TPP-member America gains more favourable terms of trade with Vietnam, Malaysia and Chile. American job creation will soar once again from the surge in sales of tariff-free IBM mainframes to the governments and private-sector businesses of America’s fellow TPP countries. And American consumers will enjoy greater access to, and lower prices for, Kiwi woollens and Vietnamese shrimp, the most nutritious in the world. •Finally, if America opts out of the TPP negotiations, the other 11 TPP member-countries, including Canada, will remain committed to the TPP. That would greatly disadvantage the U.S., which would be on the outside looking into one of the world’s biggest free-trade zones. That is the scenario that Britain faces if it exits the European Union (EU) in March, as the U.K. PM has said she will do. Outside the TPP, America loses the chance to isolate China, whose growing regional influence is of great concern to Washington. Conversely, a TPP whose members include the largest- and third-largest economies (the U.S. and Japan, respectively) will tame China’s recent adventurism in the South China Sea and elsewhere. Accordingly, China has already signalled an interest in eventually joining the TPP, and so has the emerging economic powerhouse South Korea. It’s a simple matter of geopolitics. The U.S. can allow its influence in the world to weaken by revoking NAFTA and rejecting membership in the TPP. Or the U.S. can use its membership in the world’s biggest trade blocks, in which it will be the biggest member, to gain still more influence in both the Pacific Rim and Latin America. Trump and Clinton are emphatic adherents to Pax Americana. Retreat from free trade is one of the surest ways of undermining that U.S. doctrine. Neither of these candidates wants to be the first U.S. president to break faith with it. What’s at stake for Canada in the U.S. presidential vote on Nov. 8? Surprisingly little, as it happens. For all the storm and fury of this most unpleasant of U.S. presidential campaigns, the two chief contenders are actually campaigning on common ground. The chief issues for both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are job creation, boosting economic growth, national security, and what they each regard as genuine free trade.

Yet either candidate, as president, will almost certainly leave NAFTA wholly or largely untouched, and will also lead America into a ratified TPP. Trump is a global entrepreneur. His business has long generated much of its profits outside the U.S. And Hillary Clinton was a Day One negotiator for America on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in her role as U.S. secretary of state. Stepping away from the TPP talks, on completing her tenure at State, Clinton declared that the not-yet-completed TPP is “the gold standard of trade agreements.” Why would each of these candidates flip-flop on free trade after becoming U.S. president? This space can highlight only some of the many compelling reasons: •Most of the low-skill, low-pay U.S. jobs that were vulnerable to offshoring have already been lost. And in the main, they haven’t been lost to America’s NAFTA partners Mexico and Canada. Most have been lost to China, South Korea, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Cambodia and other lower-cost jurisdictions with which the U.S. has no trade deals. They’ve also been lost from the U.S. Midwest to the world’s newest sweatshop, the low-pay, anti-union U.S. South. •Trump has all but declared a trade war with China. But no one wins in a trade war. Americans who can only afford to shop at Wal-Mart or Costco will find the shelves bare. And China’s retaliatory walls against U.S. imports would enrage CEOs of the Fortune 500, who would demand compensation for the damage Trump has done to their extensive Chinese investments. Given America’s current era of discontent, bashing the Chinese, Muslims and Mexicans might be a slam dunk in winning a presidential nomination. But doing so as president is profoundly contrary to America’s economic interests. •For the U.S. economy, there is tremendous upside potential in using the TPP to bulk up U.S. trade with America’s existing trading partners (TPP members Japan and Australia) and cracking new markets in the Pacific Rim (Malaysia, Vietnam, New Zealand) and Latin America (Chile, Peru, Colombia). America derives only about 20 per cent of its GDP from exports, pointing to a tremendous upside potential for the U.S. economy by becoming a more substantial exporter. Frankly, as a mature economy, America’s internal economic growth rate will be modest for decades to come. For America’s GDP to grow substantially, the U.S. simply must build up its export prowess. And that can be achieved only by embracing free trade. Clinton and Trump know this. And they have each been watering down their anti-trade talk as the election approaches. Trump regards himself as a superb negotiator, and relishes the chance to, as he has said, “negotiate the best trade deals ever.” But whether Trump or Clinton are able to improve much on what seven years of TPP negotiations have already yielded is beside the point. They’ve each revealed themselves as free traders, in stark contrast to what they’ve said on the campaign trail. •Strengthening NAFTA and recommitting to the TPP would enable the U.S., finally, to establish harmonious relations with a Latin America that, in the main, has felt nothing but the back of America’s hand for generations. •Free trade has been good for the U.S. In the six years after the U.S. joined Mexico and Canada in creating NAFTA in 1994, the U.S. created 23 million new jobs, a record that remains unsurpassed. And Canada has seen a whopping 173-per-cent increase in merchandise exports to the U.S. alone from 1994 to the present. As a TPP-member America gains more favourable terms of trade with Vietnam, Malaysia and Chile. American job creation will soar once again from the surge in sales of tariff-free IBM mainframes to the governments and private-sector businesses of America’s fellow TPP countries. And American consumers will enjoy greater access to, and lower prices for, Kiwi woollens and Vietnamese shrimp, the most nutritious in the world. •Finally, if America opts out of the TPP negotiations, the other 11 TPP member-countries, including Canada, will remain committed to the TPP. That would greatly disadvantage the U.S., which would be on the outside looking into one of the world’s biggest free-trade zones. That is the scenario that Britain faces if it exits the European Union (EU) in March, as the U.K. PM has said she will do. Outside the TPP, America loses the chance to isolate China, whose growing regional influence is of great concern to Washington. Conversely, a TPP whose members include the largest- and third-largest economies (the U.S. and Japan, respectively) will tame China’s recent adventurism in the South China Sea and elsewhere. Accordingly, China has already signalled an interest in eventually joining the TPP, and so has the emerging economic powerhouse South Korea. It’s a simple matter of geopolitics. The U.S. can allow its influence in the world to weaken by revoking NAFTA and rejecting membership in the TPP. Or the U.S. can use its membership in the world’s biggest trade blocks, in which it will be the biggest member, to gain still more influence in both the Pacific Rim and Latin America. Trump and Clinton are emphatic adherents to Pax Americana. Retreat from free trade is one of the surest ways of undermining that U.S. doctrine. Neither of these candidates wants to be the first U.S. president to break faith with it.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Amazon Echo And Google Home Set To Battle For Holiday Dominance Posted: Nov 5 2016, 4:00am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 7 2016, 3:33am CST, in News | Black Friday   This story may contain affiliate links.   The contender to Amazon's digital assistant home device has arrived. The fight is on this Holidays. Who will win? Amazon stood up Google and Apple with the release of Amazon Echo two years ago. That is right. While Google was still playing with sandbox toys, Amazon has shipped a device that can answer all your questions you ask out loud in your home. For two years there was nothing comparable. Now Google finally ships the Google Home device, a direct competitor to the Amazon Echo. Don't Miss: Best Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals Update: Amazon launched on November 7 an Amazon Echo deal with the lowest price in the history to celebrate the 2nd birthday of the Amazon Echo. The Amozon Echo sells for $140.39 for a limited time. Google Home comes out of the gate with a $50 lower price. Google Home sells for $129 at Walmart, Target and Best Buy. These retailers make a big deal out of the Google Home launch and feature the product prominently in their stores. Google is set to go full in with the Google Home this Holiday season and attack Amazon's market share with the Echo.  The Amazon Echo had a two year head start and Amazon used this time to get a long list of developers behind the Alexa platform. There are more than hundred Amazon Echo Skills that enable the device to play music, order food and control your home. Google Home is behind, but also offers a developer platform that will quickly add these skills. So which home assistant is better? You can't go wrong with either one. A side to side test asking questions to Echo and Home on Digital Trends shows that Google Home is a bit better in answering knowledge questions. Amazon needs to be careful not to get behind in that field. For instance Alexa fails to answer the question what koalas eat. The Amazon Echo sold for $149 on Prime Day earlier this year and in the Black Friday sale last year. Amazon is in full control of the pricing of the Amazon Echo and it will be clear that the Amazon Black Friday 2016 deal will be at least as low as $129 to match Google Home. We could even imagine that Amazon goes in the offensive and prices the Amazon Echo for under $100. Amazon has its e-commerce eco system behind the Amazon Echo. Google does not have that advantage. For Amazon, the Echo is just another way to get people to shop on Amazon.com. Amazon Prime members can use their voice to order anything on Amazon.com just by asking Alexa on their Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, Amazon Tap, Amazon Fire TV, or Fire tablet. Amazon will even have hundreds of exclusive deals just for voice shoppers this holiday season listed at www.amazon.com/alexadeals. You can have Alexa tell you her deals by just asking: "Alexa, what are your deals?" Jeff Bezos' Amazon imperium will not let Google to easily waltz in between them and shoppers. There are no rumors yet about Amazon releasing a new Amazon Echo 2. A new Echo that leaps Google Home in performance and specifications would be the best weapon, but it is not clear what new hardware features would be improving the user experience. The Amazon Echo comes in white and black and is available on amazon.com and at Best Buy.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Smoking Leads To DNA Mutations That Cause Cancer Posted: Nov 5 2016, 6:39am CDT | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Latest Science News   Getty Images Smoking leads to Mutations in the DNA of the Smokers   It has been found that smoking cigarettes leads to mutations in the DNA of the smokers. Smoking has been found to have a deleterious effect on the DNA of smokers. The novel study showed how tobacco consumption had such a harmful impact on the human body. Don't Miss: Best Amazon Black Friday 2016 Deals For those folks who consume a pack of cigarettes each and every day, they are allowing for changes in their body which may do untold harm in the future. The study was published in the journal Science. The cells in the human body which are exposed to the smoke are in particular vulnerable to extensive damage on a long term basis. Over 150 mutations occur among these cells. 97 of these are in the larynx and 39 are in the mouth. Smoking both harms the organs directly exposed to the smoke as well as those organs which are indirectly involved with the smoking. Genetic changes and the chance occurrence of cancers is also increased by several percentage points. Although the evidence for this link between smoking and cancer was always there, now physical and visible proof of the changes in the human body due to smoking are available. Smoking is connected with 17 types of cancer. It also kills 6 million people on an annual basis. Tobacco smoke contains 60 carcinogens. The genes are mutated thanks to these carcinogens and thus the likelihood of cancer is doubled and tripled in smokers. Those who smoke a pack a day are liable to have 150 extra mutations in their lungs on an annual basis. Lung cancer is always a risk that hangs over the heads of heavy smokers like the proverbial Sword of Damocles. The likelihood of lung cancer among men who smoke is 23 times whereas in women it is 13 times. The experts examined 5000 tumors and these came from 17 types of cancers. The one causal reason for all these various cancers was smoking. It all ultimately boiled down to changes in the DNA. Some of the effects are directly linked and others are indirectly linked. Even DNA methylation showed changes. Every cancerous genome is a record of sorts which reveals what exactly occurred on a regular basis and caused the cancer to attack the body of the individual. Smoking has been identified as the biggest contributor to cancer risk among average populations on a worldwide level.

Charter school advocates host 'Yes on 2' event in Springfield Michelle Hernandez, a mother of three living in Springfield. Great Schools Massachusetts, an educational organization advocating for lifting the charter school cap, held an event in downtown Springfield on Monday, September 12, 2016 in support of the ballot effort to lift the cap. Print Email Shira Schoenberg | sschoenberg@repub.com By Shira Schoenberg | sschoenberg@repub.com masslive.com Follow on Twitter on November 05, 2016 at 7:00 AM, updated November 05, 2016 at 7:09 AM comments The Republican/MassLive.com is running a series of stories looking at who is funding each of the four 2016 Massachusetts ballot questions. Here is a look at the money behind Question 2. By far, the most well-funded ballot question is Question 2, which would allow the state to approve 12 new charter schools a year outside of an existing cap. Supporters of charter school expansion, primarily through the Great Schools Massachusetts committee, have raised $23.6 million. The opponents of expansion, Save Our Public Schools, have raised $14.1 million. Some of the money funding the charter school effort comes from local corporations. One ballot committee, Expanding Educational Opportunities, raised a total of $575,000 from seven Massachusetts businesses — MassMutual Financial Group, State Street Bank, EMC Corporation, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Partners Healthcare, The Kraft Group and Suffolk Cares. (The committee gave the money to Great Schools Massachusetts, the main pro-charter group, to spend.) Other money comes from wealthy individuals from out-of-state. Arkansas' Alice Walton, who runs a family foundation funded by the proceeds from Wal-Mart, donated $710,000, while her brother Jim Walton gave $1.1 million. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg contributed $490,000. A lot of the money comes from individuals in the financial industry, generally working in Boston. The investigative news outlet International Business Times reported that financial executives who manage money for Massachusetts state pension funds contributed $778,000 to groups backing Question 2. There are also outside education reform groups who have contributed huge sums of money to the campaign. Most notably, the New York-based Families for Excellent Schools gave $15.6 million. Groups like Families for Excellent Schools are nonprofits that do not have to disclose their donors. "This is a truly unprecedented financial push by the charter school industry and their billionaire backers to buy our election with untraceable money whose source we will never know," said Juan Cofield, president of the New England Area Conference of the NAACP and chairman of the No on Question 2 campaign, in a statement. Dominic Slowey, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Charter Public School Association, responded that the outside money is a way to "balance the political playing field" with unions who have influenced federal, state and local elections for years. "For decades, the teachers' union has been able to outspend and outmaneuver and out-politick on Beacon Hill to control the debate and to influence legislative outcomes," Slowey said. "This is the first time that we're able to have some financial assistance behind us to put up a fight." Slowey added that most of the charter school campaign's money is coming from business leaders, community leaders and philanthropists. Mo Cunningham, associate professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Boston, said the U.S. Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, which allowed corporations to give unlimited amounts of money to political campaigns, made so-called "dark money," where the donors do not have to be disclosed, much more common. "Outside spending and dark money is part of the landscape now," Cunningham said. The anti-charter school money comes mainly from teachers' unions. The Massachusetts Teachers Association donated $7.5 million, the American Federation of Teachers donated $2 million, the National Education Association gave $5.4 million, and tens of thousands of dollars apiece came from local teachers' unions in Boston, Salem, Lynn, Lawrence and Lowell. Several labor unions also donated to the ballot committee. The enormous amount of money on both sides of the question means that both campaigns have been running a large amount of paid advertising, in addition to conducting direct mail campaigns and grassroots organizing. Polling has found that voters are paying a lot of attention to the discussion, even though it will primarily affect urban districts, and it will likely be a tight race.

The home improvement superstore, to be built on 3.4 hectares at the intersection of Sain and Tole bi streets, will create 400 new jobs. Photo: kapital.kz “OBI’s entrance into Kazakhstan means global revolution in amenities provision. We used to find solutions to modernising markets in different ways and working with major global retailers is a number one decision we focused on,” said Almaty Deputy Akim (Mayor) Yerlan Aukenov during the Oct. 28 Auezov Invest Forum, reported Kapital.kz. Founded in Germany in 1970, OBI has become a leading European DIY retailer with 570 hypermarkets in Central and Eastern Europe. The company’s annual turnover amounts to about 7 billion euro (US$7.7 billion). The hypermarket offers construction, renovation and gardening equipment as well as car accessories, bathroom equipment and lights. Carrefour, which has the second largest trade turnover in the world after Walmart, is already established in the Kazakh market. OBI is among the top retailers for gardening and amenities items. Aukenov noted Kazakh bazaars have a very narrow selection and prices are higher than they should be, while OBI offers quality, a broad range of goods and acceptable prices. “With this approach, we will make the market transparent. This is about the development of an entire city,” he added. All permit procedures between the Akimat (city administration) and Asadel Retail Group, which owns the hypermarket’s franchise, have been concluded and construction was slated to begin Nov. 1, said Asadel Director Nurlan Abdikarimov at the forum, according to Kapital.kz. “We are already looking at the market and think that perhaps Almaty will have three OBI hypermarkets. We have an offer on where to locate the second store. We will review the offer more closely based on local and commercial terms. Astana will be next and elaborations on locating that facility are also being held already. During the next five years we plan to build six hypermarkets in Kazakhstan, but I think we will not stop there. Perhaps there will be more; it all depends on market conditions,” he said, according to the news agency. Construction of the second OBI in Almaty and those in Astana and Shymkent will begin in 2017; the store in Aktobe is scheduled for 2018 and the one in Karaganda in 2019. “We are a DIY (Do It Yourself) retailer. Our formant is different from that of others and our country does not have one yet, I believe,” said Abdikarimov. OBI was approved in Russia 10 years ago and has been extremely successful, opening 27 hypermarkets with a huge turnover. The local population has been very interested in the format, he added. Similarly, he suggested Kazakhs will find the stores to be an acceptable and convenient way to offer goods that could help improve housing and living conditions. Manufacturers from Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) countries will supply most of the merchandise. Household and garden commodities under the hypermarkets’s OBI, CMI and Lux store brands will be an important feature, according to Kapital.kz.

Big-money corporate lobbying has reached into one of the most obscure corners of state government: the offices of secretaries of state, the people charged with running elections impartially. The targeting of secretaries of state with campaign donations, corporate-funded weekend outings and secret meetings with industry lobbyists reflects an intense focus on often overlooked ballot questions, which the secretaries frequently help write. The ballot initiatives are meant to give voters a direct voice on policy issues such as the minimum wage and the environment. But corporate and other special interests are doing their best to build close ties with the secretaries because a difference of even a few words on a ballot measure can have an enormous impact on the outcome. The influence campaign has intensified, with more citizen-driven ballot initiatives to be decided on Election Day this year than at any time in the past decade. Secretaries of state from Washington, Ohio, Colorado and Nevada — all Republicans — participated in closed-door meetings in May with representatives from Reynolds American, the nation’s second-largest tobacco company; the National Restaurant Association; and the National Rifle Association, while ballot initiative signatures in those states were still being collected, documents obtained through open records requests show. At a weekend retreat last month at a hunting lodge in Kansas, Republican secretaries of state mingled with donors, including a representative from Koch Industries, as they shot pheasant and clay pigeons. The owners of Koch Industries — Charles G. and David H. Koch — have funded groups involved in several ballot initiative fights this year, including over a solar energy measure in Florida. “The Koch brothers out with the Republican secretaries of state — that’s a news story I don’t need,” Allen Richardson, a Koch lobbyist, joked, unaware that a reporter was in attendance. Groups aligned with Democrats have also targeted secretaries of state, mobilizing during the 2014 campaign to try to elect more officials sympathetic to their causes. “With so many important issues being decided through ballot initiatives (increases in the minimum wage, gay marriage, environmental protections, etc.), increasing our involvement in electing secretaries of state who will stand with working families is vital,” said a strategy memo co-written by Steve Rosenthal, a veteran political strategist for labor unions. The May meetings between industry officials and the Republican Secretaries of State Committee, a fundraising group, were set up to give the industry players a chance to weigh in on ballot initiatives that the secretaries were overseeing, emails show. In an email with the subject line “Ballot Initiative Private Meetings in DC,” Emily Keech, the committee’s executive director, invited Barbara Cegavske, the Nevada secretary of state, to join the sessions by phone, noting that the others were flying in. “I know that the National Rifle Association has some concerns in NV so it would be helpful to get your insights,” Keech wrote, referring to a Nevada initiative that would more broadly require background checks for gun sales, a measure opposed by the NRA. She assured Cegavske that the meetings would be kept confidential. “I don’t want that listed anywhere since it is a sensitive topic for some secretaries,” Keech wrote in the email. In briefing papers she later sent, she detailed the ballot initiatives the industry groups were concerned with — and just how much the groups had donated for Republican election efforts. Some former secretaries of state said the new fundraising tactics could hurt the image of the offices as impartial referees of state elections. “It is extremely important that the public trust their elections and have confidence they are going to be handled in a fair and impartial way,” said Sam Reed, a former Republican secretary of state in Washington. “And ballot issues in particular are very sensitive.” Twenty-six states allow citizens to enact or repeal laws through a popular vote. The initiative process began over a century ago as a way to circumvent state legislatures, considered at the time to be dominated by powerful corporate interests. There are 71 citizen initiatives this year, according to Ballotpedia, a nonprofit group that tracks state elections, and spending on those initiatives has reached at least $821 million. With billions at stake, major corporations routinely hire consulting firms to help them influence ballot initiatives. “The key to any ballot measure is the right language,” Nathan Sproul, the managing partner at Lincoln Strategy Group, whose client list has included Walmart, Philip Morris International and Wynn Resorts, told a roomful of lobbyists in September at a closed-door strategy session in Alexandria, Va. “In Arizona, you write the concept, and then the secretary of state writes the language.” Another Lincoln executive, Ulrico Izaguirre, told attendees, as he ran through a long list of Election Day items before voters this year: “The clouds of ballot measures threaten business on a daily basis. Thunderous clouds.” Republicans have turned to initiatives to push their agenda as a counter to liberal activists, according to an internal party memo. “Ballot initiatives will not be the left’s mechanism for gaining power and advancing their agenda when voters have already rejected them,” said the memo, from the Republican State Leadership Committee, in February 2015 as the group prepared fundraising efforts. “It’s time for conservatives to take back that power by rejecting their efforts and promoting our own.” The Republican organization that hosted the closed-door meetings in Washington is an arm of the Republican State Leadership Committee, a political group dedicated to electing candidates to state government posts. In a July 2015 memo, the leadership group said, “The diverse set of responsibilities held by Republican Secretaries across the country presents previously unidentified opportunities for significant growth and expansion,” and then discussed “the importance of ballot initiatives” as a fundraising tool. And money has poured in. Reynolds American has contributed $990,000 in the past two years to the Republican State Leadership Committee, and Altria, the nation’s largest cigarette company, has given at least $540,000 — making them the second- and third-biggest donors to the organization, behind the United States Chamber of Commerce. The NRA has donated at least $160,000. Ellie Hockenbury, a spokeswoman for the Republican State Leadership Committee, said the meetings and other conversations with donors were simply informational. And secretaries of state said their efforts to raise money had no impact on their actions as government officials. “When you are trying to raise money, you try to work with people who have an interest in the subjects,” said Wayne Williams, the Colorado secretary of state. He added, “I will meet with anybody on any side of the subject at any time.” But Christin Fernandez, a spokeswoman for the restaurant association, acknowledged that the organization, at its headquarters in Washington, had expressed concerns to the secretaries of state about the minimum-wage ballot initiatives. “As a membership organization, the National Restaurant Association and our state partners meet with many different organizations on both sides of the aisle to voice the concerns,” she said in a statement. Email records from Nevada show that the Republican fundraising efforts are linked to ballot initiatives. A spreadsheet obtained from Cegavske includes a “contact list” prepared by Keech, the Republican Secretaries of State Committee’s executive director. “I would ask for $25k due to the gambling and gaming initiatives all across the country,” Keech wrote to Cegavske, referring to Wynn Resorts, along with a list of other possible donors, and their ties to ballot initiative efforts. Another target for a solicitation was NV Energy, which is facing a proposed constitutional amendment, requiring voter approval, to end the company’s monopoly over much of the state’s electricity market. Cegavske’s executive assistant wrote back to Keech, reporting that the effort had generated some cash return. “Barbara has contacted NV Energy and they are good for a contribution,” the executive assistant, Jennifer Russell, wrote in April. “What great news!!!!” Keech wrote back. “The Secretaries’ contacts are ALWAYS better than ours.” In a statement, Cegavske said the suggestion that she had sought money from NV Energy because of the pending ballot initiative was “categorically false.” Democrats have also attracted large donations from labor unions and activists with an intense interest in ballot agenda items. Michael R. Bloomberg donated $250,000 this year to an Oregon candidate who as a state legislator had helped push through a law on background checks for gun sales. A spokesman for Bloomberg said the donation was not related to any effort to influence future ballot measures. Labor union and abortion rights groups, however, were more explicit. The confidential memo drafted by veteran labor union organizers before the 2014 election — published last month by WikiLeaks as part of the cache of emails stolen from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta — said those groups were prepared to support the effort. “The office of Secretary of State is playing an increasingly important role for progressives,” the memo said, noting its “pivotal roles in the ballot initiative process.” The impact of these donations and private gatherings on actions by secretaries of state is difficult to gauge, given the dozens of small language changes as the ballot measures are being prepared for Election Day. But there are hints of possible benefits. For example, a gun control initiative on the Nevada ballot next week was framed by the secretary of state as a measure that would “prohibit” firearm transfers without background checks, rather than as a required additional step before a gun sale could take place. This is a seemingly small but important difference that gun control supporters say makes the ballot item less palatable to voters. Cegavske said the ballot language she used fairly reflected text submitted to her office by those advocating the measure. “There was no input from the gun industry in the writing of the ballot question,” Gail J. Anderson, the deputy secretary for Southern Nevada, said in a statement. After a minimum-wage campaign accelerated last year in Ohio, emails show, Jon A. Husted, the secretary of state, communicated with an Ohio Chamber of Commerce affiliate as the business group discussed plans with the restaurant industry to “meet and strategize” about its opposition effort. A spokesman for Husted said that “the amendment and referendum processes can be cumbersome” and that “the secretary is often asked to come explain precisely how it works.” Minimum-wage advocates chastised Washington’s secretary of state, Kim Wyman, who is in the midst of a re-election campaign. She has benefited from a blitz of radio advertisements paid for by the Republican group that sponsored the May meetings with industry representatives. Wyman declined requests to comment. At the three-day hunt — where corporate donors and secretaries of state from Kansas, Mississippi, Georgia and Arkansas shared a one-story, wood-frame hunting lodge, with stuffed deer and elk antlers mounted on the walls — there was little discussion of formal election matters. Instead, it was an opportunity for the corporate executives to cement personal connections. Together, they set loose Labrador retrievers on acres of prime high-grass hunting grounds, flushing pheasants and quail from their hiding spots. “I was 60 yards away,” Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, said as he showed off two prairie chickens he had shot earlier in the day. After a dinner of shredded beef, the state officials and political contributors, some in pajamas, drank beers. The only apparent disappointment the next morning, after their first hunting outing together as a group, was that they had bagged only 58 birds, two short of their legal limit. “The two that got away,” Kobach said. “We’ll get ’em tomorrow,” said one of the corporate executives. https://www.propublica.org/article/clay-pigeons-how-lobbyists-secretly-w...   Eric Lipton is a Washington-based correspondent for The New York Times, where he writes about government relations, corporate agendas and Congress.

Updated: November 14, 2016 @ 5:53 pm Full Forecast News Sports Life Entertainment Dining Buy & Sell Close AP The Best Reason to Buy Chipotle Stock Now… And a Bear's Response newsfeedback@fool.com (Brian Stoffel and John Maxfield) Nov 4, 2016 0 Image source: Getty Images Long-term shareholders of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) have endured a rags-to-riches...and back to rags story. After years of meteoric growth, the company's sales -- and its stock -- have been deflated. But does that mean that the company is doomed? Hardly. In fact, Motley Fool analyst Brian Stoffel, who recently wrote about why he was selling his shares, admits that he thinks the company will be just fine. That doesn't, however, mean that he thinks the stock is a good buy. Fellow Fool analyst John Maxfield, however, begs to differ. He took to Twitter following Chipotle's recent earnings release -- and stock drop -- to share his opinion. Why are #Chipotle's shares tanking? Because of amateurs. Buy $CMG at this price. You'll thank yourself in 5 years. https://t.co/zwtwFnBKfo pic.twitter.com/nXulpdkKAS — John J. Maxfield (@OneMarlandRoad) October 26, 2016 Below, John shares why he's so bullish on the company, and Brian follows up with a response. Chipotle will weather this storm and recover even stronger John Maxfield: It's impossible to deny that the fallout from Chipotle's foodborne illness outbreaks has been significant. Its profits fell 95% in the third quarter. Its restaurant-level operating margins have been sliced in half. And its same-store sales in September were still 20% below where they were in the same month last year. But the question that enterprising investors should ask themselves is this: Did these outbreaks permanently impair Chipotle's brand, or will the effect be temporary? The answer, in my opinion, is that the impairment is most likely to be temporary. As I've argued before, Chipotle is not the first popular food chain to be abandoned by customers after a foodborne illness outbreak. The same thing has happened to McDonalds, KFC, Taco Bell, and Jack in the Box, and even Costco, Wal-Mart, and Whole Foods. Yet ask yourself today, when you go to any of these companies' locations, are you concerned about contracting E. coli? To this end, on Chipotle's third-quarter conference call its executives offered tangible evidence to suggest that customers are indeed coming back to its stores. Nearly all (95%) of its most loyal customers have returned. And while formally less frequent customers haven't come back at the same rate, the burrito chain saw 30 million new customers visit its restaurants in the past six months. Finally, while Chipotle has long promoted the narrative that it's a healthier, more sustainably sourced option than its fast food counterparts, the real value it brings to the table for an ordinary Joe like me is delicious food. By Chipotle's own admission, this suffered in the wake of the crisis, as it focused solely on food safety. I'm no epicurean, but even I noticed the degradation in quality. But the chain has corrected this. With an aggressive marketing campaign on the horizon, coupled with a return to its primary value proposition -- serving delicious food -- I believe Chipotle's struggles will soon be forgotten by even its most ardent critics. I don't disagree, but that doesn't make the stock a buy There's not a whole lot that I disagree with in here. Lots of companies go through tough times -- and live to see another day. While I rarely eat out these days -- thanks to being the father of a three-year old -- I still make time to visit the local Chipotle when I can slip out. I've said before that I don't think the food scandal is the cause of Chipotle's (the stock, not the company) fall, but rather a catalyst. I think the competition will be catching up, and the days of comparable store sales growth (comps) of nearly 20% are long gone. Keep up with money news, sent to your inbox Sign Up!

The difference between my view and John's, as I see it, has more to do with the stock's price than with the underlying company's ability to bounce back. Currently, shares are trading for about 38 times expected earnings in 2017. I simply don't think that Chipotle will be able to grow fast enough to justify those prices. It's hard to find an apples-to-apples comparison, but when we look at other restaurants of a similar size and age, we see that Chipotle has very lofty expectations baked into the stock price. Create column charts Data source: E*Trade At the end of the day, the restaurant industry is a brutal one. The value of your brand and reputation are the only real competitive advantages you have. If you're the first mover -- as Chipotle was in its simple-menu format and ethically sourced food -- you can make waves. But eventually, you'll become a victim of your own success. Competition will catch on, copy you, and steal your growth thunder. That's actually good news for all of us, as it means more delicious options to choose from. It also won't spell the end for Chipotle's business. But as far as the stock goes, I simply think expectations are far too high. A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The shareholder, among the company's 10 biggest, raised its concerns in recent meetings with activist investment funds after losing patience with the company's direction, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the process is private. The investor cited Whole Foods' poor inventory and vendor management, high costs and failure to make the most of its unique appeal to millennial shoppers among the key issues. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Several activist investors, who asked not to be named, said they are aware of the shareholder's suggestions and are studying Whole Foods carefully. It's unclear if any has begun accumulating a position in the Austin, Texas-based company, which has a market value of about $8.9 billion. "Whole Foods Market values the strong and open relationships we have with our shareholders," Brooke Buchanan, a spokeswoman for the company, said in an email Friday. "As discussed on Wednesday's earnings call, we are focused on pursuing the right strategies to position the company to produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the long term." Shares of Whole Foods rose 2.7 percent to $29.22 at 12:42 p.m. in New York after being temporarily halted. The stock has suffered a steep decline, falling by half from a 2015 high of $57.20. The company said Wednesday it will end its longstanding practice of having dual chief executive officers, naming co-founder and co-CEO John Mackey to serve as sole CEO starting Dec. 31. Larger mainstream grocers, including Kroger and Wal-Mart Stores, continue to advance on Whole Foods' organic turf, weighing on sales. Kroger has a market value of about $29 billion and Wal-Mart is valued at about $214 billion. Whole Foods is trying to fight back by offering more discounts and starting a new chain aimed at younger shoppers. Organic products have become widely available at U.S. stores, often at lower prices than Whole Foods offers. Food deflation hasn't helped the company, as other retailers slash prices amid falling costs for items like beef and eggs. Whole Foods has said its new chain, called 365, will add to 1,200 conventional stores it already plans to build. That forecast was issued in 2013, shortly after the stock reached its all-time high of $65.24. Analysts have since questioned whether there's capacity for more high-end organic grocers in the U.S.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES LDS Church 'retires' Mormon apostle's 'little factory' pamphlet Critics cringe at Trump strategist Bannon's ties to alt-right, rhetoric targeting Mormons Utah football: Oregon is struggling, but Utes still see a dangerous team (with video) Democrat Elijah Cummings presses Jason Chaffetz to investigate Donald Trump's finances Jazz update: Hood, Hill, Favors, Diaw questionable vs. Memphis ELEVATE Life is a Peach at the SALT Awards   Salt Lake Regional Medical Center First in the U.S. to Perform Meniscus Replacement   From Wall St to Hawaii to Utah Valley: UVU Professor Cary Wasden Mentors MBA Finance Students   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

She said there were multiple factors that went into the decision, including the need for shopping hours. “We decided it would be in the best interest of those working in and for the mall and for their families to take the day off,” Freeland said. “Everybody needs a break.” According to the National Retail Federation, the Black Friday weekend brought in more than 151 million shoppers nationwide last year, making it the largest shopping weekend of the year. “It’s crazy,” Freeland said. “But it’s fun. It’s a lot of fun.” She said in years past, they have estimated between 90,000-100,000 people visit the mall over the three-day shopping period. Many stores in the area, like Walmart and Macy’s, will remain open on Thanksgiving to begin sales. However, those at Kentucky Oaks Mall aren’t concerned that being closed will cut into their profits. Freeland said while they want to remain competitive with the stores that are choosing to remain open, they are still expecting to bring in a large amount of consumers Friday morning. “People will be relaxed and ready to shop,” she said. She said they plan on continuing the Balloon Drop Friday morning, which is a tradition that the mall looks forward to every year. “There’s a prize in every balloon. It might be $5 or $500. You just never know,” said Freeland. She said the community has rallied around their decision to be closed, which is something that makes them feel like they are doing the right thing. Freeland said they’ve received dozens of messages from community members applauding them for the move and showing their support. “I’ve even had an employee say that she almost cried because she has a new baby, and she was so happy she would be home to spend Thanksgiving with her family,” Freeland said. Kentucky Oaks Mall is corporately owned by Cafaro Company, which is based out of Niles, Ohio. The company has 12 other malls, each of which decide whether or not to remain open on the holiday. Freeland said Cafaro, as well as those who work at Kentucky Oaks Mall, will evaluate the results of this year’s sales to see what happens in the future.

(Al Hartmann | The Salt Lake Tribune) The old Granite High School at 3300 S. 500 E. in South Salt Lake remains boarded up in July. A prominent developerís deal to buy the old property has been extended and a new development plan is in the works. Garbett Homes and Wasatch Property's previous plan included 78 homes and a retail center anchored by a neighborhood Wal-Mart grocery store and would have put $10.6 million in Granite School Districtís coffers. Residents reluctant to back residential plan that doesn’t include details on commercial half of site. Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) The South Salt Lake Planning Commission is expected to vote Nov. 17 on a new proposal to develop the southern half of the old Granite High School property. But the plan got 3½ hours of attention at the commission's meeting Thursday, where about 25 residents chimed in. A plan to develop the site of the closed century-old school with homes and a Wal-Mart grocery store on the northern portion died at the hands of a mayoral veto in March. Now, Garbett Homes has revived the deal with a proposal that focuses only on the less-controversial residential half of the lot. Garbett Homes has applied to change the land use to get started on construction of about 80 homes near 3540 S. 500 East. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The developer says the homes will imitate the style and solar capability of homes in the nearby Terra Sol development and feature a 1-acre park. The commission's feedback to Garbett Homes: The proposed park doesn't meet city standards for green space, and the commission also thinks it could be better situated to serve the larger public. Community Development Director Michael Florence says some of the speakers from the public liked the plan, and some listed lack of green space and wanting to preserve the property's history as concerns. Most opponents brought grievances from the old plan. Residents hesitated to back a plan that didn't specify what would happen to the commercial northern half of the old school site. "We made it clear to the Planning Commission that they had to consider the merits of the project that was in front of them, because the north half wasn't part of this project," said Florence.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR NEWS Critics cringe at Trump strategist Bannon's ties to alt-right, rhetoric targeting Mormons Democrat Elijah Cummings presses Jason Chaffetz to investigate Donald Trump's finances Poll reveals mixed feelings on Utah's 'Zion Curtain' law as restaurants plan new effort to tear down LDS classic 'Miracle of Forgiveness' fading away, and some Mormons say it's time Gov.

By Robert Faturechi, ProPublica and Eric Lipton, The New York Times click to enlarge Copyright: kyoza3d / 123RF Stock Photo Big-money corporate lobbying has reached into one of the most obscure corners of state government: the offices of secretaries of state, the people charged with running elections impartially. The targeting of secretaries of state with campaign donations, corporate-funded weekend outings and secret meetings with industry lobbyists reflects an intense focus on often overlooked ballot questions, which the secretaries frequently help write. The ballot initiatives are meant to give voters a direct voice on policy issues such as the minimum wage and the environment. But corporate and other special interests are doing their best to build close ties with the secretaries because a difference of even a few words on a ballot measure can have an enormous impact on the outcome. The influence campaign has intensified, with more citizen-driven ballot initiatives to be decided on Election Day this year than at any time in the past decade. Secretaries of state from Washington, Ohio, Colorado and Nevada — all Republicans — participated in closed-door meetings in May with representatives from Reynolds American, the nation's second-largest tobacco company; the National Restaurant Association; and the National Rifle Association, while ballot initiative signatures in those states were still being collected, documents obtained through open records requests show. At a weekend retreat last month at a hunting lodge in Kansas, Republican secretaries of state mingled with donors, including a representative from Koch Industries, as they shot pheasant and clay pigeons. The owners of Koch Industries — Charles G. and David H. Koch — have funded groups involved in several ballot initiative fights this year, including over a solar energy measure in Florida. "The Koch brothers out with the Republican secretaries of state — that's a news story I don't need," Allen Richardson, a Koch lobbyist, joked, unaware that a reporter was in attendance. Groups aligned with Democrats have also targeted secretaries of state, mobilizing during the 2014 campaign to try to elect more officials sympathetic to their causes. "With so many important issues being decided through ballot initiatives (increases in the minimum wage, gay marriage, environmental protections, etc.), increasing our involvement in electing secretaries of state who will stand with working families is vital," said a strategy memo co-written by Steve Rosenthal, a veteran political strategist for labor unions. The May meetings between industry officials and the Republican Secretaries of State Committee, a fundraising group, were set up to give the industry players a chance to weigh in on ballot initiatives that the secretaries were overseeing, emails show. In an email with the subject line "Ballot Initiative Private Meetings in DC," Emily Keech, the committee's executive director, invited Barbara Cegavske, the Nevada secretary of state, to join the sessions by phone, noting that the others were flying in. "I know that the National Rifle Association has some concerns in NV so it would be helpful to get your insights," Keech wrote, referring to a Nevada initiative that would more broadly require background checks for gun sales, a measure opposed by the NRA. She assured Cegavske that the meetings would be kept confidential. "I don't want that listed anywhere since it is a sensitive topic for some secretaries," Keech wrote in the email. In briefing papers she later sent, she detailed the ballot initiatives the industry groups were concerned with — and just how much the groups had donated for Republican election efforts. Some former secretaries of state said the new fundraising tactics could hurt the image of the offices as impartial referees of state elections. "It is extremely important that the public trust their elections and have confidence they are going to be handled in a fair and impartial way," said Sam Reed, a former Republican secretary of state in Washington. "And ballot issues in particular are very sensitive." Twenty-six states allow citizens to enact or repeal laws through a popular vote. The initiative process began over a century ago as a way to circumvent state legislatures, considered at the time to be dominated by powerful corporate interests. There are 71 citizen initiatives this year, according to Ballotpedia, a nonprofit group that tracks state elections, and spending on those initiatives has reached at least $821 million. With billions at stake, major corporations routinely hire consulting firms to help them influence ballot initiatives. "The key to any ballot measure is the right language," Nathan Sproul, the managing partner at Lincoln Strategy Group, whose client list has included Walmart, Philip Morris International and Wynn Resorts, told a roomful of lobbyists in September at a closed-door strategy session in Alexandria, Va. "In Arizona, you write the concept, and then the secretary of state writes the language." Another Lincoln executive, Ulrico Izaguirre, told attendees, as he ran through a long list of Election Day items before voters this year: "The clouds of ballot measures threaten business on a daily basis. Thunderous clouds." Republicans have turned to initiatives to push their agenda as a counter to liberal activists, according to an internal party memo. "Ballot initiatives will not be the left's mechanism for gaining power and advancing their agenda when voters have already rejected them," said the memo, from the Republican State Leadership Committee, in February 2015 as the group prepared fundraising efforts. "It's time for conservatives to take back that power by rejecting their efforts and promoting our own." The Republican organization that hosted the closed-door meetings in Washington is an arm of the Republican State Leadership Committee, a political group dedicated to electing candidates to state government posts. In a July 2015 memo, the leadership group said, "The diverse set of responsibilities held by Republican Secretaries across the country presents previously unidentified opportunities for significant growth and expansion," and then discussed "the importance of ballot initiatives" as a fundraising tool. And money has poured in. Reynolds American has contributed $990,000 in the past two years to the Republican State Leadership Committee, and Altria, the nation's largest cigarette company, has given at least $540,000 — making them the second- and third-biggest donors to the organization, behind the United States Chamber of Commerce. The NRA has donated at least $160,000. Ellie Hockenbury, a spokeswoman for the Republican State Leadership Committee, said the meetings and other conversations with donors were simply informational. And secretaries of state said their efforts to raise money had no impact on their actions as government officials. "When you are trying to raise money, you try to work with people who have an interest in the subjects," said Wayne Williams, the Colorado secretary of state. He added, "I will meet with anybody on any side of the subject at any time." But Christin Fernandez, a spokeswoman for the restaurant association, acknowledged that the organization, at its headquarters in Washington, had expressed concerns to the secretaries of state about the minimum-wage ballot initiatives. "As a membership organization, the National Restaurant Association and our state partners meet with many different organizations on both sides of the aisle to voice the concerns," she said in a statement. Email records from Nevada show that the Republican fundraising efforts are linked to ballot initiatives. A spreadsheet obtained from Cegavske includes a "contact list" prepared by Keech, the Republican Secretaries of State Committee's executive director. "I would ask for $25k due to the gambling and gaming initiatives all across the country," Keech wrote to Cegavske, referring to Wynn Resorts, along with a list of other possible donors, and their ties to ballot initiative efforts. Another target for a solicitation was NV Energy, which is facing a proposed constitutional amendment, requiring voter approval, to end the company's monopoly over much of the state's electricity market. Cegavske's executive assistant wrote back to Keech, reporting that the effort had generated some cash return. "Barbara has contacted NV Energy and they are good for a contribution," the executive assistant, Jennifer Russell, wrote in April. "What great news!!!!" Keech wrote back. "The Secretaries' contacts are ALWAYS better than ours." In a statement, Cegavske said the suggestion that she had sought money from NV Energy because of the pending ballot initiative was "categorically false." Democrats have also attracted large donations from labor unions and activists with an intense interest in ballot agenda items. Michael R. Bloomberg donated $250,000 this year to an Oregon candidate who as a state legislator had helped push through a law on background checks for gun sales. A spokesman for Bloomberg said the donation was not related to any effort to influence future ballot measures. Labor union and abortion rights groups, however, were more explicit. The confidential memo drafted by veteran labor union organizers before the 2014 election — published last month by WikiLeaks as part of the cache of emails stolen from Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John D. Podesta — said those groups were prepared to support the effort. "The office of Secretary of State is playing an increasingly important role for progressives," the memo said, noting its "pivotal roles in the ballot initiative process." The impact of these donations and private gatherings on actions by secretaries of state is difficult to gauge, given the dozens of small language changes as the ballot measures are being prepared for Election Day. But there are hints of possible benefits. For example, a gun control initiative on the Nevada ballot next week was framed by the secretary of state as a measure that would "prohibit" firearm transfers without background checks, rather than as a required additional step before a gun sale could take place. This is a seemingly small but important difference that gun control supporters say makes the ballot item less palatable to voters. Cegavske said the ballot language she used fairly reflected text submitted to her office by those advocating the measure. "There was no input from the gun industry in the writing of the ballot question," Gail J. Anderson, the deputy secretary for Southern Nevada, said in a statement. After a minimum-wage campaign accelerated last year in Ohio, emails show, Jon A. Husted, the secretary of state, communicated with an Ohio Chamber of Commerce affiliate as the business group discussed plans with the restaurant industry to "meet and strategize" about its opposition effort. A spokesman for Husted said that "the amendment and referendum processes can be cumbersome" and that "the secretary is often asked to come explain precisely how it works." Minimum-wage advocates chastised Washington's secretary of state, Kim Wyman, who is in the midst of a re-election campaign. She has benefited from a blitz of radio advertisements paid for by the Republican group that sponsored the May meetings with industry representatives. Wyman declined requests to comment. At the three-day hunt — where corporate donors and secretaries of state from Kansas, Mississippi, Georgia and Arkansas shared a one-story, wood-frame hunting lodge, with stuffed deer and elk antlers mounted on the walls — there was little discussion of formal election matters. Instead, it was an opportunity for the corporate executives to cement personal connections. Together, they set loose Labrador retrievers on acres of prime high-grass hunting grounds, flushing pheasants and quail from their hiding spots. "I was 60 yards away," Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, said as he showed off two prairie chickens he had shot earlier in the day. After a dinner of shredded beef, the state officials and political contributors, some in pajamas, drank beers. The only apparent disappointment the next morning, after their first hunting outing together as a group, was that they had bagged only 58 birds, two short of their legal limit. "The two that got away," Kobach said. "We'll get 'em tomorrow," said one of the corporate executives.

Ed Kaiser / Edmonton Journal Share Adjust Comment Print Canada’s Supreme Court ruled in Edmonton’s favour Friday in a contentious tax case that could have cost the city big time. “This isn’t just about Capilano. This is a huge win for us on assessment,” said Mayor Don Iveson, celebrating the news after a committee meeting Friday.  The split 5-4 ruling was about whether the city’s Assessment Review Board has the power to increase assessments when property owners appeal, and whether the courts should trust that board as the experts in determining the value of a property. It started in 2011, when the City of Edmonton sought to increased the assessed value of Capilano Mall to $31 million. The owners of Capilano Mall appealed to the board, a city-appointed independent tribunal, arguing their property was only worth $22 million.  But after Capilano’s owner gave city officials its submissions and evidence, city staff decided the property was not classified properly in city records — it was listed as community centre instead of a power centre. They also had rent for its main tenant, Wal-Mart, at $3.50 a square foot when it should have been $11.50. City staff resubmitted an assessment saying the property was actually worth $45 million. The assessment board decided on $41 million. Capilano’s owner appealed. Both the Court of Queen’s Bench and the Alberta Court of Appeal ruled in Capilano’s favour, ordering a new hearing. But the City of Edmonton raised the matter to the Supreme Court. The four dissenting judges said the board only had jurisdiction to rule on issues raised in Capilano’s original complaint. It should have ignored the city’s new submissions. But five judges ruled the assessment board’s decision to increase the assessment was reasonable, and higher courts should respect the tribunal’s expertise in property evaluation. The Supreme Court decision is final. “That’s a pretty big win for us,” said Rod Risling, branch manager for assessment and taxation. This year, 2,467 property owners filed complaints, including many of the most high-value properties. Most downtown office towers file an appeal every year, Risling said. Since the Court of Queen’s Bench ruling, the tribunal has not been allowed to increase an assessment, only decrease it when a complaint is filed, said Risling. On Friday, that changed back again. “We’re thrilled to see the Supreme Court upheld what has been the practice,” said Risling. “If they see an error, they have the ability to increase (the assessment again). … We just want everyone to pay their fair share.” An owner’s property and education taxes are based on a property’s assessed value each year. This year, businesses pay $1,912 for every $100,000, which means Capilano Mall would pay $783,920 if their property is still at $41 million. estolte@postmedia.com twitter.com/estolte  Delay on solving stinky pipes doesn't pass smell test for Edmonton...

Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to sidebar News World More Why no one really seems to care that Hillary will be the first female president Ashley Csanady  11.04.2016 Hillary Clinton speaks at a rally at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, Friday, Nov. 4, 2016. Seneca Falls Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright introduces Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at a campaign event at Rundlett Middle School, in Concord, N.H. ShareAdjustCommentPrint One could argue Hillary Clinton’s race to the White House began here in a small, red-brick chapel on a sunny June morning 168 years ago. It was 1848 — 99 years before the woman who could be America’s first female president was born in a leafy suburb of Chicago — and as many as 300 women and men were packed into the tiny building in upstate New York. The gathering would come to be known as the Seneca Falls Convention, the birthplace of the women’s rights movement.  After two days of speeches from luminaries such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Frederick Douglass, 68 women and 32 men signed the Declaration of Sentiments, which borrowed language from America’s founding document to declare: “We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal.” It took 72 more years for women to get the vote. A year later, in 1921, Margaret Sanger founded the precursor to Planned Parenthood. Another four decades would pass before birth control was fully legalized in the U.S. in 1960. In 1982, while Clinton was the first and only partner in a female law firm in Arkansas, the Equal Rights Amendment died. This was an effort to enshrine in the U.S. Constitution the belief expressed in Seneca Falls — that men and women are equal under the law. But at the same time as Clinton became a passionate advocate for women, critics say she worked against the most marginalized: she sat on the boards of or represented companies such as Walmart, took money from corporations that run prisons, gave $250,000 talks at Goldman Sachs, argued single-payer health care would be impossible in America and voted for the war in Iraq. “I can’t really see her as the kind of feminist that I would like to embrace,” said Liza Featherstone, editor of the book, False Choices: The Faux Feminism of Hillary Rodham Clinton. “I think it is kind of a faux victory.” But Trump, with his misogynist — and worse — record, “would be an incredibly depressing development for feminism in the United States and around the globe.” Hillary Rodham Clinton — she took her husband’s name over a decade into their marriage for the sole purpose of political expediency — is, in many ways, as imperfect a first female president as the women’s movement itself. As much as she’s maligned on the left, Clinton is loathed on the right for her feminism. “Feminism is no longer a term that’s used to enable or empower women,” Carly Fiorina said in June at the Faith and Freedom Coalition conference after her failed bid for the Republican nomination. “It turns out to be in so many people’s eyes, in Hillary Clinton’s eyes, kind of a way to bludgeon people into a left-wing litany of causes.” Perhaps that’s why it’s taken 168 years to see a woman so close to the White House: even other women can’t agree on what a madam president should look like. As Eleanor Roosevelt, one of Clinton’s heroes, said: “Women do not want a woman to be president, nor would they have the slightest confidence in her abilities to fulfill the functions of that office. Every woman who fails in a public position confirms this, but every woman who succeeds creates confidence.”  Roosevelt was not saying women would never hold the highest offices in the land. Quite the contrary. Many interpret her comments as a criticism of the anti-suffrage, anti-women female politicians who campaigned and won races in the decades after the 19th Amendment that gave women the vote in 1920. It’s yet another reason enthusiasm for Clinton remains so muted: few believe she will actually change that much, given how firmly she’s entrenched in the establishment. “One of the reasons that we’re not having this conversation about historic firsts is because she’s tried to campaign on that in 2008 and failed,” said Leandra Zarnow, an assistant history professor at the University of Houston. Clinton’s campaign has been a lot more subtle about using the “gender card,” especially during the primaries and before Trump made it an obvious play. If, however, there’s a “special place in hell” for women who don’t support other women, as former secretary of state Madeleine Albright put it, younger women aren’t buying in. “Anecdotally, based on focus groups, older women were much more willing to say, ‘I want to see a female president in my lifetime, Hillary Clinton might not be perfect,’… but it would tip their decision,” said Kristen Soltis Anderson, a Republican pollster with Echlon Insights. “Younger women believe we will get there regardless. They want someone who believes in what they believe more than the symbolism of a woman.” Of the many campaign moments, one of the most memorable was when Trump called Clinton a “nasty woman.” But much earlier, after he inaccurately described a third-term abortion, Clinton responded with a passionate defence, a heart-breaking story about late-term abortions and a family who had to endure one because of medical necessity. Even that — a first in presidential debate history — wasn’t feminist enough for some. “Even when abortion is a tragic choice for women, it needs to be legal and it must never be apologized for,” said Yasmin Nair, an activist who is one of Clinton’s loudest critics on the left. She said true feminists support “abortion on demand.” Allowing the rhetoric of abortion-as-tragedy to creep into the discourse is just one of Clinton’s many sins against the sisterhood. The debate about Clinton’s feminist cred is not quite as old as women’s rights themselves — those divisions emerged as Seneca Falls let out. “In some ways you can’t remake people’s implicit attitudes … but the fact that a woman is in that role begins to recalibrate those expectations,” said Kim Campbell, Canada’s only female prime minister. Quite frankly, the more people who describe themselves as feminists, the better She was also the first women to become federal justice minister and convened the country’s first and only National Symposium on Women, Law and the Administration of Justice. She stick-handled abortion and rape-shield laws and boldly declared she was a feminist.  “Feminism isn’t something just the left gets to have,” Campbell said. “Quite frankly, the more people who describe themselves as feminists, the better.” Michelle Rempel, a Conservative MP and former Cabinet minister, went through a similar wringer when she was placed behind former prime minister Stephen Harper in question period after being promoted to Cabinet. She was in “the shot” that made the nightly news, and her presence got fingers tweeting that she was there as a token. “I earned my way there and for young women to be able to see me in the shot on the (evening) news, I belonged there, and they could see themselves in that role,” Rempel said. “Showing it can be done is something very powerful.” Though she’s not politically aligned with Clinton, she called her candidacy the “capstone of the feminist movement.” Back at Seneca Falls, a woman with the same big brown eyes and soft face as a young Elizabeth Cady Stanton, with brown curls pressed under a 19th-century style bonnet, worries some will think a madam president means the dreams expressed on that hot July day in 1848 have all been realized. “I would be cautious about the symbolism. In the 19th century, the idea was that once we achieved suffrage, all other problems would fall away,” said Melinda Grube, who dons the ancient garb about twice a month to act as Cady Stanton at the Women’s Rights National Historic Park in Seneca Falls. “If we stop at the convention or if we stop at the 19th Amendment, or if we stop at a woman president, then we haven’t completed our journey.” But maybe the hope lies in the very fact Clinton’s candidacy isn’t being touted as the end of the line. “Hillary Clinton is not the Democratic nominee as a token,” Rempel said. “She’s doing it in a way that’s blind to her gender. The population is saying, ‘I’m going to measure you based on who you are’ “And that’s something truly remarkable.” National Post Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.
