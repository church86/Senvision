Details of the agreement, which was announced Thursday and ended a months-long dispute between the two corporate behemoths, have not been provided by the companies. But Dan Kelly, president and CEO of the CFIB, says he suspects Walmart was able to negotiate a reduction in merchant fees—a move that could impact smaller merchants. “Typically whenever there is a special deal created for one large merchant, it happens at the expense of smaller merchants,” he said, explaining that credit card companies and banks customarily look for different ways to make up lost fee revenue. “We’re going to have to watch this really closely to see if this special deal for Walmart comes with higher prices for other smaller merchants.” Visa spokeswoman Carla Hindman said the company’s agreement with Walmart is specific to that retailer and doesn’t affect other merchants. “As previously announced, we have implemented rate changes aimed at lowering costs for businesses in Canada several times,” Hindman said in an email. MORE FEES: Where Will Credit Card Fees Go From Here? » In July, Walmart began refusing Visa credit cards at its three stores in Thunder Bay, Ont., citing excessive fees. In October, it extended that ban to Manitoba, where it has 16 stores. The retail giant had been planning to phase out the cards at all of its 400 stores in Canada. But after reaching a deal with the credit card company, Walmart resumed accepting Visas at its Thunder Bay and Manitoba stores on Friday. Kelly says CFIB, which represents over 109,000 business owners across the country, will continue to lobby Visa and other credit card companies for lower merchant fees for small- and medium-sized companies. “Small firms have complained for many years about the high cost of credit card processing fees, just like Walmart has,” Kelly said. On average, interchange fees in Canada are 1.5%, according to the Retail Council of Canada, which represents retailers including Walmart. “It is a significant cost for the merchant community,” said David Wilkes, the council’s senior vice-president of government relations and the grocery division. “Those costs have an inflationary impact on product costs and consumer purchases.” The Canadian fees are much higher than they are in many other jurisdictions, said Wilkes, citing France as an example. There, merchants pay interchange fees of around 0.3%, he said. The Finance Department has said it’s reviewing merchant fees to determine whether the costs and benefits are appropriate. In 2014, Visa and MasterCard agreed to limit interchange fees to an average of 1.5% for five years.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Walmart and Visa have ended an acrimonious and public battle over fees that saw the retail giant refuse to accept Visa credit cards in its northern Ontario and Manitoba stores. In a brief statement Thursday afternoon, Walmart said it would allow customers in those regions to once again use Visa cards beginning Friday. “We have come to an agreement with Visa which allows us to continue offering Visa as a form of payment in our stores,” Alex Roberton, senior director of corporate affairs at Walmart, said in the emailed statement. Carla Hindman, a spokesperson for Visa, confirmed that Visa cards will be accepted “as a form of payment in all Walmart stores across Canada” as of Friday. Related Walmart stops accepting Visa today at all its stores in Manitoba as fee dispute continues Visa ups ante in battle with Walmart by offering Manitobans $10 to shop where card is accepted Walmart Canada expands ban on Visa to Manitoba, raising stakes in high-profile fee dispute Neither side would provide details of their deal, with both citing confidential business terms. The fight, which emerged in June, stemmed from a re-negotiation over how much Walmart would pay in interchange fees. These fees are collected from all merchants that accept credit cards as a method of payment, and are shared among credit card companies such as Visa and Mastercard, the banks that issue the credit cards, and credit card processors. After a surprise weekend announcement by Walmart last summer that it would begin phasing out acceptance of Visa cards in its Canadian stores, Visa accused the retailing behemoth of using its own customers as “leverage” in an attempt to pay lower fees than others, including charities and schools. In an open letter to cardholders and other merchants published in June, including in the National Post, Visa said the pair had been negotiating for months, with Walmart ultimately offered “one of the lowest rates of any merchant” in Canada. For its part, Walmart said it was trying to keep fees and all its costs as low as possible to avoid passing them along to customers through higher prices. Interchange fees have come under increasing scrutiny around the world in recent years amid complaints from retail and consumer groups, and even some politicians, who fear they ultimately drive up the cost of goods for consumers. On Thursday, officials from both Walmart and Visa declined to say where the two sides landed on the interchange fees in their latest agreement. “Visa doesn’t disclose confidential business terms,” Hindman said. One industry source told the Post in June that Canadian banks that issue Visa cards had an incentive to urge the credit card company to go back to negotiations with Walmart. This person estimated the banks had $82 million in interchange fees at stake. All was not quiet over the months the two companies were feuding. In November, Visa launched a promotion in Manitoba that seemed to be encouraging shoppers to buy their groceries anywhere but Walmart, where they could not use their Visa cards at the time. A $10 credit was given to cardholders who registered their cards and then made a purchase of $50 or more at a grocery store in Manitoba. Disputes over interchange fees have led to government intervention to regulate the setting of the fees in some countries. This has not been the case in Canada where, in late 2014, the fees charged to retailers across Canada were voluntarily reduced after a series of negotiations. However, retail and consumer groups have continued to complain that the rates in Canada outstrip those in Australia and parts of Europe.

ShoeBuy’s inventory includes more than 1 million items across 800 brands. (Bigstock Photo) Walmart is already using its deep pockets to help recent acquisition Jet.com compete with Amazon in online apparel. Walmart on Thursday announced it acquired Boston-based ShoeBuy, a competitor of Amazon-owned Zappos, for $70 million to help Jet beef up its shoe game. ShoeBuy, which was founded in 1999 as one of the first companies to sell shoes online, will remain independent and CEO Mike Sorabella will stay on. Prior to the purchase, ShoeBuy was owned by IAC, a New York-based media company whose chairman is Expedia chairman Barry Diller. Walmart purchased Jet in August for $3.3 billion.The deal combined an ambitious e-commerce startup with a physical retail giant, both of whom have struggled to dent Amazon’s online business on their own. ShoeBuy’s inventory of more than 1 million items spread across 800 brands, including shoes, clothing, accessories and bags, will help bolster Jet’s presence in the apparel arena. The clothing market is highly fragmented, with 45 percent of all sales coming from outside the top 15 players in the industry, according to a recent report from Cowen & Co. That leaves room for Walmart-Jet to make a move in the industry, but Cowen sees Amazon becoming the top clothing retailer in the U.S. this year. Just in the last couple days, it has come out that Amazon is looking at creating its own line of activewear, and the online retail giant is among those interested in acquiring bankrupt retailer American Apparel.

In July, Walmart began refusing Visa credit cards at its three stores in Thunder Bay, citing excessive fees. In October, it extended that ban to Manitoba.  (Toronto Star File)   By The Canadian Press Fri., Jan. 6, 2017 The head of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business says he is concerned that a deal struck between Walmart Canada and Visa over merchant fees could lead to higher costs for smaller businesses. Details of the agreement, which was announced Thursday and ended a months-long dispute between the two corporate behemoths, have not been provided by the companies. But Dan Kelly, president and CEO of the CFIB, says he suspects Walmart was able to negotiate a reduction in merchant fees — a move that could impact smaller merchants. “Typically whenever there is a special deal created for one large merchant, it happens at the expense of smaller merchants,” he said, explaining that credit card companies and banks customarily look for other ways to make up lost fee revenue. “We're going to have to watch this really closely to see if this special deal for Walmart comes with higher prices for other smaller merchants.” Article Continued Below CFIB, which represents over 109,000 business owners across the country, will continue to lobby Visa and other credit card companies for lower merchant fees for small- and medium-sized companies, Kelly added. In July, Walmart began refusing Visa credit cards at its three stores in Thunder Bay, Ont., citing excessive fees. In October, it extended that ban to Manitoba, where it has 16 stores. As of Friday, Walmart resumed accepting Visa at those stores. Visa spokeswoman Carla Hindman said the company's agreement with Walmart is specific to that retailer and doesn't affect other merchants. “As previously announced, we have implemented rate changes aimed at lowering costs for businesses in Canada several times,” Hindman said in an email.

According to CBS News, Timothy Blake was charged December 30th with pandering obscenity, sexual imposition and two counts of menace by stalking.  Officials say they first received a report on Nov. 2, from a woman who said she was shopping at Walmart when she noticed a man she described as “’creepy,’ who seemed to be lingering around her,” according to an arrest affidavit obtained by CBS News.  She said the man walked to within a few inches behind her and she then felt something wet on her lower back and foot. She “began to panic” and rushed to a bathroom where she discovered the substance was “sticky,” when she left the bathroom, she allegedly saw the man continuing to watch her. Police said surveillance video from the store showed the man squirting the woman. On Dec. 28, police received a similar report from a different woman. Surveillance video from both incidents showed the suspect driving away in a pickup truck that was spotted two days later by Marietta Police. Officers approached the vehicle’s owner, Blake, and asked to question him. The 26-year-old at first allegedly told police he had thrown egg yolks at the women, but when an officer told him they had tested the material, he allegedly admitted it was semen.  He then said he had used syringes to spray egg, spit or semen on women on a dozen occasions, according to the affidavit. Blake allegedly said that before each incident, he masturbated into the syringe either in his vehicle or in the Walmart bathroom. He allegedly said he aimed for the buttocks of his victims. In the case of the victim on Nov. 2, Blake allegedly said he targeted her because he believed “she displayed exhibitionist characteristics and wanted to be noticed,” according to the affidavit. “The defendant stated maybe it was his way of having sex with these women,” police wrote in the affidavit. Blake is married, according to the affidavit, but said his wife was unaware of these incidents. Police said he also blamed his parents, who he said molested him when he was a child. Blake was booked into jail without bond, pending his arraignment. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Brewer, 54, has been with Wal-Mart since 2006 and has been Sam’s Club CEO since 2012. She first worked for Wal-Mart as a regional vice president of operations in Georgia, and would be promoted to president of what was then designated Walmart East. Prior to Wal-Mart, Brewer worked as a scientist with Kimberly-Clark Corp. for 22 years, eventually becoming president of the Global Nonwovens Sector. She earned a bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Spelman College. The retirement agreement shows that Brewer will remain a Wal-Mart employee through January 2019. She will receive $1.9 million in several payments for the next two years, and almost 30,000 in restricted shares will be made available to Brewer when she leaves the company in 2019. The value of those shares in current dollars is around $2 million. As part of the agreement, Brewer turns back to Wal-Mart 145,733 shares. She is also prevented from participating in a business “that competes with the Company that exceeds certain revenue thresholds, and from soliciting the Company’s associates for employment,” according to Wal-Mart’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Furner, 42, who has served as chief merchandising officer for Wal-Mart Stores, now manages all merchandising for Sam’s Club including global sourcing, packaging and private label products. He joined Wal-Mart as an hourly employee in 1993 and worked his way up from management intern to a divisional merchandise manager in 2006. His travels through the corporate ranks included being senior vice president and chief merchandising officer for Walmart China. Furner has a bachelor’s degree in marketing management from the University of Arkansas. Brewer’s Struggles, Technology Push Brewer has been a champion for diversity in the workplace in a sector that is still largely male in top executive roles. Brewer noted in the release she is seeking “a new challenge” with this move. Brewer was also able to shepherd in technology throughout the club shopping experience working with Walmart.com’s team in San Bruno and eventually getting their own digital executive in Jamie Iannone, president and CEO of SamsClub.com, the e-commerce business for Sam’s Club since 2014. Since that time, Sam’s Club has leaped ahead of Walmart in terms of technology applications used in clubs. Sam’s offered Click and Collect – online orders picked up in clubs – several years before Walmart U.S. The scan and go application that allows Sam’s members to shop and skip the checkout line was rolled out nationally last year. Walmart U.S. is still testing scan and go in some stores, but it’s not part of the Walmart app and requires customers to use another device and still go through a checkout process. Alan Ellstrand, associate dean of academic programs and research at the University of Arkansas, was not surprised to hear of Brewer’s exit. He said when Walmart promoted Brewer, a black female, to a top executive post the world took note, but the luster wore thin over the years as the retailer struggled to move the needle to Wal-Mart’s satisfaction. Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon said multiple times in recent years that Sam’s Club would need to do better with comp sales and overall performance. ‘Good Test’ for Furner Ellstrand said Walmart has looked at its Sam’s Club CEO position as a stepping stone in its larger executive trajectory. Because of that, the CEO post at Sam’s Club has been a revolving door of sorts and five years is about as long as anyone holds that post. Given that Brewer is not circulating back through Wal-Mart’s executive ranks likely indicates the retirement was not solely her idea, he added. When Charles Redfield, the chief operating officer for Sam’s Club under most of Brewer’s tenure as CEO, returned to Walmart to lead the retailer’s grocery division in 2016, Furner was brought in to Sam’s Club. Ellstrand said Furner is seen as an up and comer in the Wal-Mart corporate ranks and he’s taking over Sam’s Club at a time when the bar is low, unlike Brewer who came at a high bar, left by Brian Cornell. Then the 51-year-old Cornell exited Sam’s Club in 2012 to take a similar post with PepsiCo Americas and in 2014, the 54-year old Cornell became CEO for Target, a position he still holds. “It’s a great opportunity for Furner to demonstrate his ability to lead and if he succeeds in this post, there are bigger jobs to be had at Walmart,” Ellstrand said. “Running Sam’s Club is a good test for future leaders at Walmart. It’s like being governor before serving as president.” Wal-Mart made the announcement public on Friday and sent an internal memo to its employees. In the memo, McMillon had this to say about Furner: “In John, we see someone who loves the company and our associates, has learned the business from the bottom up and across, and has the desire to lead change which is so necessary in today’s environment.” Sam’s Club is a members-only warehouse club that posted fiscal 2016 revenue of $57 billion and has around 110,000 employees in more than 650 stores. The smallest of Wal-Mart’s three business units, Sam’s Club business accounted for about 12% of the company’s fiscal 2016 net sales.

Brewer, 54, a champion of diversity within the workplace, came under fire after she alluded that she saw a problem with an all Caucasian male staff at a Sam's Club supplier. The comments, made during a CNN interview in December, was seen by some critics as promoting workplace racism, triggering hashtags "#boycottsamsclub" and "#boycottracistsamsclub". Under Brewer's five-year tenure as CEO, Sam's Club's sales rose 5.6 percent to $56.2 billion. The unit's same-store sales growth beat analysts' estimates in the past three quarters. Furner, currently the chief merchandising officer at Sam's Club, joined Wal-Mart in 1993. Furner, 42, has served in various capacities, including as the chief merchandising officer of Walmart China. "In John, we see someone who loves the company and our associates, has learned the business from the bottom up and across, and has the desire to lead change which is so necessary in today's environment," Wal-Mart's Chief Executive Doug McMillon said in the memo. Sam's Club, the smallest of Wal-Mart's three business units, operates membership-only warehouse clubs in 48 states in the United States and in Puerto Rico. The business accounted for about 12 percent of the company's fiscal 2016 net sales. The world's biggest retailer's shares were down 1.3 percent in afternoon trading on Friday and was the top percentage loser among Dow stocks.

(NYSE:WMT), intent on competing with Amazon, has acquired a major online shoe retailer via a subsidiary, it announced yesterday. Walmart-owned Jet.com bought ShoeBuy for $70 million, in a move that mirrors Amazon’s big acquisition of Zappos several years ago. That purchase put Amazon front-and-center in the online shoe world, and WMT is now clearly wants to enjoy similar positioning. From CNET: Jet said it bought ShoeBuy through its parent Walmart from media and internet company IAC, in a deal that closed Dec. 30. It said ShoeBuy is a leading online seller of shoes, clothes and accessories, stocking more than a million items. ShoeBuy will operate as a standalone site, but its suppliers have the option of expanding to sales on Jet too, the company said. ShoeBuy CEO Mike Sorabella, his executive team and the company’s more than 200 employees will continue to be based in Boston, Massachusetts. Walmart acquired online retailer Jet.com last year for $3.3 billion, proving that online expansion was its main priority. It plans to invest billions more into e-commerce, while correspondingly slowing its new store openings. Wal-Mart shares were unchanged in premarket trading Friday. Year-to-date, WMT has gained 0.13%, versus a 1.28% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. WMT currently has an StockNews.com POWR Rating of B (Buy), and is ranked #5 of 20 stocks in the Grocery/Big Box Retailers category. This article is brought to you courtesy of StockNews.com.

(Jeff Walters/CBC) Related Stories Walmart to lift ban on Visa after settling of fee dispute 'They're going to war' — Thunder Bay, Ont., ground zero in Visa vs. Walmart fight Walmart's staredown with Visa gets real today, as cards no longer accepted at 3 Ontario stores Walmart in Thunder Bay, Ont., will no longer accept Visa come Monday Walmart no longer taking VISA cards at Thunder Bay stores New front open in Walmart's war with Visa, as cards will soon be banned in Manitoba The Walmart-Visa standoff: Who's winning? Walmart ban on accepting Visa won't last, expert says Goliath vs. Goliath: consumers caught in middle of high-stakes fee fight between Visa and Walmart Thunder Bay's Walmart stores will once again Visa cards starting this morning. The world's largest retailer and the world's biggest credit card company reached an agreement that would see stores in Thunder Bay, Ont., once again accept the cards. The announcement came as a surprise to many shoppers outside one of the city's three Walmarts. "I thought they were trying to make a point of trying to get rid of Visa, so it's kind of funny that Visa's back," said Rebecca Taddeo as she loaded groceries from her shopping cart into her car. "I honestly use debit most of the time, I try not to use credit. But, I do have a Visa and I did find it quite inconvenient when they didn't offer it. I mean, it didn't stop me from coming here, but we do get a lot of rewards and points with our Visa." At the heart of the dispute were the fees charged by Visa to retailers like Walmart. The big box store said Visa's fees were too high. Visa told Walmart that the 'interchange fees' charged to the retailer were some of the lowest on all its cards. One of dozens of Visa billboards in Thunder Bay, Ont., is located right next to the city's largest Walmart store. The two retail and credit card giants were locked in a battle over interchange fees. (Jeff Walters/CBC) "It was kind of a silly idea I guess for them to drop it, I try not to use mine as much as I can," said Brian Neureuther. "But, I'm sure there's a lot of people that have only have a Visa or use it a lot for groceries and stuff." The impact of the spat between Walmart and Visa is difficult to quantify, but the credit card giant took out ads in local newspapers, as well as many billboards around Thunder Bay to promote the card. "I noticed there's lots of signs all around Thunder Bay saying 'we accept visa, use your visa,' or even at Toys R' Us they were offering extra bonus bucks if you used your Visa."

Customers in Manitoba and Thunder Bay, Ontario, will be able to use their Visa credit card starting January 6, 2017," Wal-Mart echoed in a statement on their website. HAVE YOUR SAY: Are you more likely to shop at Wal-Mart now that its dispute with Visa has been resolved? https://t.co/LAN4yaQXOK — BusinessNewsNetwork (@BNN) January 6, 2017 That set off a widely watched battle within the retail sector that intensified in October, when Wal-Mart expanded its policy of rejecting Visas to its 16 stores in Manitoba. The retail giant had said it was planning to expand its phase-out of Visa to all of its 400 stores in Canada. The months-long dispute became so heated that at one point Visa offered its cardholders in Manitoba a reward for buying their groceries somewhere other than Wal-Mart. It launched an advertising campaign in November offering Manitoba Visa cardholders a $10 credit if they spent $50 or more at grocery stores. The campaign didn't explicitly mention Wal-Mart or the fee dispute, but a Visa spokeswoman said at the time that the company was hoping to ease any inconvenience for Visa cardholders who can't use their cards everywhere that they want to. Visa ran a similar ad in Thunder Bay, promising cardholders there with a $25 credit for every grocery purchase of $75 or more. Visa previously said it had offered Wal-Mart one of the lowest rates for any merchant in the country, and that if it gave in to the retailer's demands then other merchants would want a reduction in their fees, as well.

Wall Street isn't optimistic about either retailer right now, and that could spell opportunity for long-term investors. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Jan 5, 2017 at 9:07PM Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) each have a nagging growth problem. For Wal-Mart, its customer traffic trends consistently trail rival Costco's (NASDAQ:COST). Lowe's, meanwhile, can't seem to break Home Depot's (NYSE:HD) tight grip on the home improvement market. However, investors shouldn't ignore retailers simply because they are outshined in some areas by rivals. In fact, these out-of-favor stocks tend to be available at attractive valuations that leave plenty of room for market-beating gains. With that in mind, let's look at these two companies as potential buy candidates. Here are a few key statistics to get us started: Metric Wal-Mart Lowe's Market cap $212 billion $62 billion Sales growth 1.4% 3.9% Net profit margin 3% 3.9% Dividend yield 2.9% 2% Return on invested capital 15% 13.6% Price-to-sales ratio 0.45 1 Price-to-earnings ratio 15 26  52-week price performance 13% (5%) Data sources: Company financial filings and S&P Global Market Intelligence. Sales growth and return on invested capital are for the past nine months and exclude fuel sales and exchange rate changes.  Growth slowdown Wal-Mart's biggest achievement over the past few years has been a steady rebound in its customer traffic trends. Shopper transactions ticked higher for the eighth consecutive time last quarter, and while its 0.7% increase trailed Costco's 2.4% jump, Wal-Mart clearly has momentum on its side. Improved average spending per visit and e-commerce sales both contributed to a near-3% revenue boost in its U.S. stores last quarter, which equates to $2 billion of extra revenue. Image source: Getty Images. Lowe's is enjoying faster growth, but only because its industry is in a sharp upswing. Comparable-store sales are up 3.9% through the first three quarters of 2016. Home Depot enjoyed nearly twice that growth pace, which is one reason why Lowe's management isn't happy with its recent performance. "Traffic slowed more than we anticipated in August and September before improving in October," CEO Robert Niblock told investors. Unlike Home Depot and Wal-Mart, Lowe's is getting help from a growing store footprint that pushes sales higher. Yet its latest results suggest it is losing more ground to rivals while Wal-Mart is winning back some share. Profits heading lower Wal-Mart's 3% profit margin makes it significantly more profitable than Costco. However, its earnings power is under considerable pressure that could stick around for years. Over the short term, profits have plunged as the retailer plowed cash into initiatives aimed at improving the customer shopping experience through higher employee wages and better stocked shelves. Rising shopper satisfaction scores and increased customer visits are the key benefits of those moves, but they came at a significant cost. Operating income fell 11% over the last full fiscal year. Lowe's isn't faring any better. In fact, its profitability has slumped as the retailer increasingly turns to price cuts to protect its sales growth. Its 3.9% net margin is less than half of Home Depot's. LOW Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. The better buy Investors can buy Lowe's at about 1 times sales, or well below Home Depot's ratio of 1.8. Similarly, Wal-Mart is available at 0.45 times the past year of revenue, compared to 0.59 times sales for Costco. While both valuations represent significant discounts, I'm more optimistic about a Wal-Mart purchase today. The retailing titan appears to have a good plan in place for protecting market share from traditional rivals and from e-commerce threats. Lowe's, on the other hand, has only seen its market share losses accelerate on challenges from a competitor that seems to have a much better read on its industry. Neither company is likely to wow shareholders with market-thumping operating results anytime soon. But Wal-Mart's sturdier traffic and profitability trends make it the better buy in this match up, in my view. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos owns shares of Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.

Timothy Blake has been charged with pandering obscenity, sexual imposition and two counts of “menace by stalking”. “The defendant stated maybe it was his way of having sex with these women,” a police affadavit seen by CBS News reportedly stated.  The first reported incident came in early November.  Mr Blake was allegedly spotted in his oilfield company's branded truck Getty A woman shopping in a Walmart, in Ohio, West Virginia, told investigators that a “creepy” man was “lingering around her”. She claimed he walked within a few inches behind her before she felt something wet on her lower back and foot. She “began to panic”, rushed to the bathroom, found a “sticky” substance. The man was still allegedly watching her when she walked back out. A surveillance video is said to have shown a man squirting the woman.

Details of the agreement, which was announced Thursday and ended a months-long dispute between the two corporate behemoths, have not been provided by the companies. But Dan Kelly, president and CEO of the CFIB, says he suspects Walmart was able to negotiate a reduction in merchant fees  a move that could impact smaller merchants. Typically whenever there is a special deal created for one large merchant, it happens at the expense of smaller merchants, he said, explaining that credit card companies and banks customarily look for different ways to make up lost fee revenue. Were going to have to watch this really closely to see if this special deal for Walmart comes with higher prices for other smaller merchants. Visa spokeswoman Carla Hindman said the companys agreement with Walmart is specific to that retailer and doesnt affect other merchants. As previously announced, we have implemented rate changes aimed at lowering costs for businesses in Canada several times, Hindman said in an email. In July, Walmart began refusing Visa credit cards at its three stores in Thunder Bay, Ont., citing excessive fees. In October, it extended that ban to Manitoba, where it has 16 stores. The retail giant had been planning to phase out the cards at all of its 400 stores in Canada. But after reaching a deal with the credit card company, Walmart resumed accepting Visas at its Thunder Bay and Manitoba stores on Friday. Kelly says CFIB, which represents over 109,000 business owners across the country, will continue to lobby Visa and other credit card companies for lower merchant fees for small- and medium-sized companies. Small firms have complained for many years about the high cost of credit card processing fees, just like Walmart has, Kelly said. On average, interchange fees in Canada are 1.5 per cent, according to the Retail Council of Canada, which represents retailers including Walmart. It is a significant cost for the merchant community, said David Wilkes, the councils senior vice-president of government relations and the grocery division. Those costs have an inflationary impact on product costs and consumer purchases. The Canadian fees are much higher than they are in many other jurisdictions, said Wilkes, citing France as an example. There, merchants pay interchange fees of around 0.3 per cent, he said. The Finance Department has said its reviewing merchant fees to determine whether the costs and benefits are appropriate. In 2014, Visa and MasterCard agreed to limit interchange fees to an average of 1.5 per cent for five years.

Details of the agreement, which was announced Thursday and ended a months-long dispute between the two corporate behemoths, have not been provided by the companies. But Dan Kelly, president and CEO of the CFIB, says he suspects Walmart was able to negotiate a reduction in merchant fees — a move that could impact smaller merchants. “Typically whenever there is a special deal created for one large merchant, it happens at the expense of smaller merchants,” he said, explaining that credit card companies and banks customarily look for different ways to make up lost fee revenue. “We’re going to have to watch this really closely to see if this special deal for Walmart comes with higher prices for other smaller merchants.” Visa spokeswoman Carla Hindman said the company’s agreement with Walmart is specific to that retailer and doesn’t affect other merchants. “As previously announced, we have implemented rate changes aimed at lowering costs for businesses in Canada several times,” Hindman said in an email. In July, Walmart began refusing Visa credit cards at its three stores in Thunder Bay, Ont., citing excessive fees. In October, it extended that ban to Manitoba, where it has 16 stores. The retail giant had been planning to phase out the cards at all of its 400 stores in Canada. But after reaching a deal with the credit card company, Walmart resumed accepting Visas at its Thunder Bay and Manitoba stores on Friday. Kelly says CFIB, which represents over 109,000 business owners across the country, will continue to lobby Visa and other credit card companies for lower merchant fees for small- and medium-sized companies. “Small firms have complained for many years about the high cost of credit card processing fees, just like Walmart has,” Kelly said. On average, interchange fees in Canada are 1.5 per cent, according to the Retail Council of Canada, which represents retailers including Walmart. “It is a significant cost for the merchant community,” said David Wilkes, the council’s senior vice-president of government relations and the grocery division. “Those costs have an inflationary impact on product costs and consumer purchases.” The Canadian fees are much higher than they are in many other jurisdictions, said Wilkes, citing France as an example. There, merchants pay interchange fees of around 0.3 per cent, he said. The Finance Department has said it’s reviewing merchant fees to determine whether the costs and benefits are appropriate. In 2014, Visa and MasterCard agreed to limit interchange fees to an average of 1.5 per cent for five years.

(WMT) Stock Is a Long-Term Risk With BIG Upside This perceived threat to Walmart stock actually presents a potentially appealing opportunity By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Jan 4, 2017, 11:10 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: 7 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks That Are Dead Weight Right Now Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is one of those laggards. Since Nov. 9, the S&P 500 has advanced an impressive 5.8%, while Walmart stock is down just a bit, and testing the waters of lower lows. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr The culprit for the weakness from WMT stock (while everything else did well) is mostly rooted in concerns that Trump’s campaign promise to impose sizeable tariffs on foreign-made goods imported into the United States … Chinese-made goods in particular. Such a move would hit Walmart right in the proverbial breadbasket, since it relies on inexpensive imported goods to provide low prices for its patrons. What if, however, the potential impact of a tariff war wasn’t likely to make as big of an impact on the per-share profitability of WMT stock as many have said it might? As it turns out, the worst of the concerns may be considerably overblown. WMT Stock: Higher Tariffs Loom The quick philosophy: If it costs more for Walmart to buy goods from overseas suppliers, the retailer will either pass those higher costs along to its shoppers, or be forced to simply “eat” the difference (or a combination of both). The former will crimp sales, as shoppers look elsewhere or do without those goods. The latter crimps net profit margins. Neither bodes well for the future value of Walmart stock. The 7 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks for 2017 The precise size of any new tariff — if imposed — hasn’t been decided yet. At one point Trump had mentioned a tariff as high as 45% on any Chinese-made imports, though now with Peter Navarro tapped to head-up the National Trade Council and plans starting to solidify, the more plausible tariff on imports from China is apt to roll in somewhere between 5% and 10%. Those are more palatable numbers than the previously suggested 45% tariff, though it remains to be seen who exactly will shoulder the burden of the added costs; consumers don’t always respond as expected. Either way, even to the extent a new White House administration can impose tariffs on any and all imports from China, most critics and pessimists are overestimating the potential impact such a move may have on WMT stock. Conversely, they may be underestimating the headwind that may be created by a more global tariff. Fortunately, it may all be mostly irrelevant. Breaking Down the Numbers for Walmart Stock Although the debate over the potential fallout of new tariffs has been vigorous, little of that discussion has clarified that the looming tariffs would be imposed at the wholesale level rather than based on retail prices, and would only apply to foreign-made goods … and the difference is significant. While the exact figure isn’t known, experts believe WMT imported roughly $50 billion worth of Chinese goods in 2013. It’s unlikely that figure has changed much in the meantime. That’s not chump-change, but for perspective, over the course of the last twelve months, Walmart has driven company-wide sales of $484.6 billion. During that time, it spent a total of $360.5 billion to purchase the merchandise it sells. That’s right — only about 14% of the amount of money spent by WMT on its inventory comes from China. If that portion of its costs rises by a full 10%, then Walmart stock’s total cost of goods sold will rise by only 1.4%. That’s manageable. It’s perhaps even negligible. As they say though, there’s more to the story. If Trump’s import tariffs start and end with China, Walmart can blow it off. If instead the President-elect tacks on even a mere 5% tariff on any imports coming into the United States, a huge chunk of its inventory could become considerably more expensive. The specifics: Right now, two-thirds of its inventory in its U.S. stores — the bulk of its business — is made, sourced or grown domestically. The numbers aren’t perfectly clear, but the costs on the non-U.S.-made portion of its inventory subject to a new tariff of only 5% would raise its total cost of goods sold to 2% or more than its current merchandise costs as a percentage revenue, ramping it up from 74.4% of sales to something closer to 76.4% of sales — at least. That presents a considerable challenge. See, while most retailer’s profit margins are paper-thin, WMT’s are even thinner than usual. Over the course of the last four quarters, the company has only converted 3% of its sales into net income. Unless Walmart is able to cut costs elsewhere and/or pass those tariff costs along to its shoppers, per-share profits of WMT stock would be whittled back to little more than a breakeven. In other words, Walmart stock’s future largely depends on how far Trump is willing to go in his quest to put America first. Or, maybe it isn’t.

Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and its prized e-commerce subsidiary Jet.com have acquired Boston-based ShoeBuy for about $70 million from IAC. The deal was announced Thursday, but closed on December 30. Founded in 1999, ShoeBuy was one of the early companies to sell shoes online, along with competitors like Zappos.com, which was acquired in 2009 by Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) for $1.2 billion. ShoeBuy founder Scott Savitz led the company until its 2006 sale to IAC. Savitz remained involved with ShoeBuy until 2011, according to his LinkedIn profile, and he is now managing partner at Data Point Capital in Boston. ShoeBuy has grown to more than 200 employees, who will remain based in Boston. ShoeBuy will continue operating as a standalone site that complements Jet’s website, according to a press release. ShoeBuy CEO Mike Sorabella and the rest of the management team will remain with the company, the release said. Jet—whose website sells a wide assortment of products—said the deal gives it access to an experienced e-commerce player with a large mix of products and “strong industry relationships,” among other benefits. ShoeBuy’s website carries more than 800 brands and over 1 million products, including shoes, clothing, and accessories, according to the press release. The release didn’t share ShoeBuy revenues. Scott Savitz speaks at a 2013 Xconomy event. Photo by Keith Spiro Photography. Although Savitz is no longer involved with ShoeBuy, Xconomy reached out to get his thoughts on the deal and what it means for his former company and the retail industry overall. “There are probably very good synergies with this,” Savitz said in an e-mail. “Jet.com gets access to the amazing representation of brands (and the relationships) Shoebuy.com has, and Shoebuy.com will get even wider distribution and other cost savings by partnering up with an 800-pound gorilla in Jet.com/Walmart.com.” For Walmart, ShoeBuy adds to its growing mix of e-commerce subsidiaries and technologies. In recent years, Walmart has spent billions on its online shopping strategy, which includes building its own data centers, increasing its online grocery offerings, and acquiring companies. Walmart’s most significant e-commerce move so far was its purchase of Hoboken, NJ-based Jet in August 2016 for $3.3 billion. The deal was seen as a way for the big box retailer to be more competitive with Amazon, but it was a big bet—Jet’s site had launched just a year earlier. Now, we’ll see if Jet and smaller acquisitions like ShoeBuy pay off. Walmart’s e-commerce efforts come during a challenging period for the company—its annual sales declined in 2015 for the first time since the retailer went public 45 years earlier. (Full-year financial results for 2016 haven’t been released yet.) Savitz thinks the ShoeBuy acquisition shows Walmart’s “commitment to the Internet and how people like to shop today,” he said. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see them buy more category leaders as they compete against Amazon and a changing retail environment.” Savitz is glad the ShoeBuy deal is structured so that his former company “will still enjoy enough independence” and that its employees will remain in Boston. “When you start these companies you hope they will create significant value for your employees, shareholders, and ultimately acquirers, and be very sustainable, real businesses,” Savitz said. “I couldn’t be prouder that ShoeBuy continues to do all these things and continues to have great impact on Boston … and in shaping Internet retail.” Jeff Engel is a senior editor at Xconomy.

Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to sidebar News National More Walmart shopper injured while chasing ‘unsafe’ shopping cart sues for $500,000 Douglas Quan  01.05.2017 Square One Shopping Centre in Mississauga, with Walmart on the right and a parking garage on the left. ShareAdjustCommentPrint A Walmart shopper in Ontario who tripped and fell while chasing after a shopping cart that rolled away from her in a parking garage is seeking half a million dollars in damages. Sandra Cartini was returning to her car on Feb. 12, 2013, at the Square One Shopping Centre in Mississauga, after shopping at Walmart, according to court records. The parking garage consists of multiple “tiered slopes.” Cartini had her young son hold on to the cart while she opened the trunk. Her son let go of the cart and it began to roll away. Cartini alleged that as she ran after the cart, she tripped on “uneven pavement” and fell, hitting her head on the cart, causing permanent and serious injuries. Her statement of claim, which seeks $250,000 in general damages and $250,000 in special damages, lists Walmart Canada Corp., property manager OPGI Management GP Inc., and landlord Square One Property Corp., as defendants. According to court records, Cartini’s original lawyer initially put forward an argument that the defendants were negligent in the design, construction and maintenance of the parking garage (the “unsafe parking lot theory”). We’re not saying every Walmart should have shopping carts with a locking mechanism. But engineers hired by the defence said the parking garage complied with industry standards and showed no signs of disrepair. The defendants filed a motion asking for summary judgment — a quick resolution that saves everyone from going to trial. During a hearing on the motion, Cartini’s new lawyer put forward an alternate argument — the “unsafe shopping cart theory” — that contends Cartini would never have been hurt if the Walmart cart had stayed in place. Faranaz Siganporia argued that common sense dictates a shopping cart on any sloped surface poses an inherent risk and that it was foreseeable that a shopper could lose control of her cart. On Dec. 29, Ontario Superior Court Judge David Corbett dismissed the claim on the basis of the “unsafe parking lot theory” but allowed Cartini the opportunity to amend her claim to argue the “unsafe shopping cart theory,” agreeing that shopping carts without brakes “are an obvious hazard to ‘get loose.’ ” “On the face of it,” the judge said, “there is some argument for the plaintiff that there may be some liability” on the part of the defendants for her injuries. “I will grant the plaintiff one more opportunity to present a case that there is a triable issue. This will require (the plaintiff) to bring Walmart into the fray, and to obtain expert evidence in respect to this theory.” The plaintiff was given until the end of January to submit an amended claim. “We’re not saying every Walmart should have shopping carts with a locking mechanism,” Siganporia said in an interview Thursday. “But obviously Walmarts located where carts can be taken on inclined surfaces, they definitely should have a locking mechanism.” Walmart declined to comment, as did the lawyer representing the other defendants. • Email: dquan@postmedia.com | Twitter: dougquan Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon A Walmart shopper in Ontario who tripped and fell while chasing after a shopping cart that rolled away from her in a parking garage is seeking half a million dollars in damages. Sandra Cartini was returning to her car on Feb. 12, 2013, at the Square One Shopping Centre in Mississauga, after shopping at Walmart, according to court records. The parking garage consists of multiple “tiered slopes.” Cartini had her young son hold on to the cart while she opened the trunk. Her son let go of the cart and it began to roll away. Cartini alleged that as she ran after the cart, she tripped on “uneven pavement” and fell, hitting her head on the cart, causing permanent and serious injuries. Her statement of claim, which seeks $250,000 in general damages and $250,000 in special damages, lists Walmart Canada Corp., property manager OPGI Management GP Inc., and landlord Square One Property Corp., as defendants. According to court records, Cartini’s original lawyer initially put forward an argument that the defendants were negligent in the design, construction and maintenance of the parking garage (the “unsafe parking lot theory”). We’re not saying every Walmart should have shopping carts with a locking mechanism. But engineers hired by the defence said the parking garage complied with industry standards and showed no signs of disrepair. The defendants filed a motion asking for summary judgment — a quick resolution that saves everyone from going to trial. During a hearing on the motion, Cartini’s new lawyer put forward an alternate argument — the “unsafe shopping cart theory” — that contends Cartini would never have been hurt if the Walmart cart had stayed in place. Faranaz Siganporia argued that common sense dictates a shopping cart on any sloped surface poses an inherent risk and that it was foreseeable that a shopper could lose control of her cart. On Dec. 29, Ontario Superior Court Judge David Corbett dismissed the claim on the basis of the “unsafe parking lot theory” but allowed Cartini the opportunity to amend her claim to argue the “unsafe shopping cart theory,” agreeing that shopping carts without brakes “are an obvious hazard to ‘get loose.’ ” “On the face of it,” the judge said, “there is some argument for the plaintiff that there may be some liability” on the part of the defendants for her injuries. “I will grant the plaintiff one more opportunity to present a case that there is a triable issue. This will require (the plaintiff) to bring Walmart into the fray, and to obtain expert evidence in respect to this theory.” The plaintiff was given until the end of January to submit an amended claim. “We’re not saying every Walmart should have shopping carts with a locking mechanism,” Siganporia said in an interview Thursday. “But obviously Walmarts located where carts can be taken on inclined surfaces, they definitely should have a locking mechanism.” Walmart declined to comment, as did the lawyer representing the other defendants. • Email: dquan@postmedia.com | Twitter: dougquan Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

ON AIR NOW6:00 PM - 7:00 PMHealthworx Radio Walmart and Visa settle payment dispute Don Mitchell January 05, 2017 03:10 pm Walmart Canada and Visa have come to an agreement ending their six month dispute which saw some stores stop accepting Visa cards. Last July, Walmart shut down Visa payments at three stores in Thunder Bay, eventually spreading the practice to all their stores in Manitoba. This was the first step in a plan to discontinue accepting Visa cards across Canada over a dispute related to interchange fees. Interchange fees are an amount deducted from each purchase by the card-issuer (Visa) in a transaction executed by the participating retailer. Typically, consumers never see the fee since the retailer works it into the cost of products. In the feud, Walmart took a stand on Visa’s interchange fees believing they were too high stating that paying in excess of $100 million a year in fees was not fair. No terms of the new deal on interchange fees was disclosed on Thursday by either party, but the two companies did confirm cards would once again be accepted in Manitoba and Thunder Bay on Friday. Visa cardholders can once again use their Visa credit cards at all Walmart stores across Canada. https://t.co/MSqHXyoSNM — Visa News Canada (@VisaNewsCA) January 5, 2017 Trending More Latest More Vancouver Traffic Tweets by @AM730Traffic Current Traffic Incidents You May Also Like More News WATCH: Vancouver man lives in storage locker for two months 2 hours ago   It's not cheap to live in Vancouver, and many people have started to get creative with cost-saving...

Shaw  |  January 5, 2017 3:58 PM EST  |  1 Timothy Blake used his bodily fluids to sexually assault women at Walmart. The first incident was initially reported at the top of November. The woman was visiting a Walmart in Mineral Wells, West Virginia when she noticed a “creepy” man following her in the store. At some point, she felt something wet on her lower back. The women went into the restroom and cleaned herself. When she walked out, Blake was starring at the woman. She attempted to approach Blake, but he ran to his pick-up truck. Another women submitted a report to authorities on Dec. 28 at the same Walmart. This time, police where able to find his pick-up truck in a surveillance video. When police caught up to Blake, he was traveling to dinner with his wife and arrested. While being questioned by authorities, Blake admitted to masturbating at least 12 times in parking lots at public shopping centers and filling his semen with syringes. He would then follow the women and squirt the fluid on their backs. His wife revealed that she did not have knowledge of Blake’s criminal behavior. With Donald Trump’s revelation that he promotes the sexual assault of women, it’s going to be important for women’s rights groups and lawmakers to remain vocal when it comes to abuse against women. Blake has been charged with two counts of pandering obscenity, menacing by stalking and sexual imposition.

Both companies said they came to an agreement but did not provide details, calling the arrangement confidential. Walmart Supercentre in Kingston, Ont., on June 20. (Photo: Lars Hagberg/The Canadian Press) Walmart began refusing Visa credit cards at its three stores in Thunder Bay in mid-July. It said it pays more than $100 million in fees every year for customers to use various brands of credit cards, and that the fees charged by Visa were excessive. That set off a widely watched battle within the retail sector that intensified in October, when Walmart expanded its policy of rejecting Visas to its 16 stores in Manitoba. The retail giant had said it was planning to expand its phase-out of Visa to all of its 400 stores in Canada. The months-long dispute became so heated that at one point Visa offered its cardholders in Manitoba a reward for buying their groceries somewhere other than Walmart. It launched an advertising campaign in November offering Manitoba Visa cardholders a $10 credit if they spent $50 or more at grocery stores. A Visa Inc. logo on a credit card. (Photo: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg via Getty Images) The campaign didn't explicitly mention Walmart or the fee dispute, but a Visa spokeswoman said at the time that the company was hoping to ease any inconvenience for Visa cardholders who can't use their cards everywhere that they want to. Visa ran a similar ad in Thunder Bay, promising cardholders there with a $25 credit for every grocery purchase of $75 or more. Visa previously said it had offered Walmart one of the lowest rates for any merchant in the country, and that if it gave in to the retailer's demands then other merchants would want a reduction in their fees, as well.Also on HuffPost: Close  The Best Credit Cards In Canada 2015 of   Scotia Momentum Visa Infinite Card MBNA Smart Cash MasterCard Credit Card SimplyCash Card from American Express Scotiabank Gold American Express Card BMO World Elite MasterCard RBC Royal Bank Visa Infinite Avion Blue Sky Credit Card (from American Express) Capital One Aspire Travel Platinum MasterCard Shell AIR MILES MasterCard from BMO TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite Card President's Choice Financial MasterCard MBNA Smart Cash MasterCard Credit Card Shell AIR MILES MasterCard from BMO Shell CashBack MasterCard from BMO MBNA TrueLine MasterCard Credit Card National Bank Syncro MasterCard Desjardins Visa Gold Modulo MBNA Platinum Plus MasterCard President's Choice Financial MasterCard Scotiabank Value VISA card National Bank MC1 MasterCard Home Trust Secured Visa Card Capital One Guaranteed MasterCard (both secured and unsecured) Scotiabank L'earn VISA card StudentAwards MBNA Rewards MasterCard BMO SPC CashBack MasterCard Scotiabank SCENE VISA card  Share  Tweet  ✖ Advertisement Share this ✖ close Current Slide More: video business video walmart visa walmart visa canada walmart visa dispute Walmart Visa fees walmart visa fees lawsuit walmart visa truce walmart canada walmart visa agreement Suggest a correction   Click here to view Conversations Conversations Suggested For You FOLLOW HUFFPOST Email Email Address Please check the checkbox to indicate your consent Options HuffPost Daily Brief Business Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..

REUTERS/Lucy NicholsonMore TORONTO (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Visa Inc reached an agreement to continue offering Visa as a payment option for customers in Canada, the two companies said on Thursday. Last summer, Walmart Canada said it would stop accepting Visa cards after a public dispute with the credit card provider over what the retail giant called "unacceptably high" merchant fees. Three stores in Thunder Bay, Ontario, and 16 stores in the province of Manitoba were impacted by the initial roll-out of the decision last year. These stores will resume accepting Visa on Friday. A Walmart Canada spokesman said details of the agreement were confidential. The original decision would have eventually impacted more than 370 outlets across Canada. No U.S. locations were affected. Retailers have long complained about merchant fees charged by credit card companies. But Walmart and Visa's negotiations were unusually public, with Visa taking up ads in Canadian newspapers, saying Walmart was using its customers as pawns in its bid to get lower fees.

Fallon/Bloomberg Wal-Mart Ends Threat to Ban Visa Credit Cards Across Canada by Doug Alexander @dscrybe More stories by Doug Alexander January 5, 2017, 6:00 PM EST January 6, 2017, 8:41 AM EST Manitoba, Thunder Bay customers can use cards starting today Retailer had threatened to expel Visa from all Canada stores Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reached an agreement to continue accepting Visa Inc. credit cards across Canada, ending the retailer’s threat to bar the world’s largest payments network from its 409 stores in the country. Customers in Manitoba and Thunder Bay, Ontario, will be able to use their Visa cards starting Friday, Alex Roberton, a spokesman for the retailer, said in an e-mailed statement. Wal-Mart’s Canadian unit threatened in June to expel Visa from all of its stores nationwide unless the network agreed to lower the amount it charges for credit-card transactions. Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, stopped accepting Visa at its three Thunder Bay outlets on July 18, and followed up three months later with a ban at 16 stores in Manitoba. “We have come to an agreement with Wal-Mart through which Visa credit cards will be accepted at all Canadian Wal-Mart stores,” Carla Hindman, a Visa Canada spokeswoman, said in a statement. She declined to elaborate. Walmart Canada, which has said it pays more than C$100 million ($76 million) annually on credit-card transaction fees, called the amount Visa charges “unacceptably high” in a June 11 statement on its website. Visa rose 0.2 percent to $81.28 in early trading at 8:34 a.m. in New York. The stock gained 7.7 percent in the past 12 months, trailing the 17 percent advance for the 67-company S&P 500 Information Technology Index. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(File Photo) Sarolta Saskiw, CTV Winnipeg Published Thursday, January 5, 2017 5:00PM CST Last Updated Thursday, January 5, 2017 8:08PM CST Manitobans will once again be able to use their Visa credit cards at Walmart stores across the province. The retail giant has been at a standstill with Visa over credit card fees since October of 2016, preventing the card from being used at any 16 Walmart locations in Manitoba. “We have come to an agreement with Walmart through which Visa credit cards will be accepted at all Canadian Walmart stores, including in Manitoba,” said Carla Hindman, spokesperson with Visa Canada. Walmart initially banned the credit card alleging it was paying too much for annual fees. However, Visa claimed it offered Walmart one of the lowest rates in the country, but the retailer wanted it reduced even more. After the ban was in place, Visa encouraged Manitoba card users in early November to spend their money at a grocery store other than Walmart – offering $10 credit for purchases $50 and more. The new agreement means cardholders can start using Visa again at Walmart starting Jan. 6.

Both companies have confirmed that shoppers at 16 Manitoba stores, as well as three in Thunder Bay, Ont., will be able to resume Visa-based purchases starting Friday. Walmart Canada has complained that service fees to accept credit cards topped $100 million annually, calling the charges from Visa “unacceptably high.” The company phased-out Visa cards at the three Thunder Bay, Ont. stores last July, followed by 16 in Manitoba in October. Walmart Canada had threatened to expand the ban to its more than 400 stores nationwide unless Visa agreed to lower the amount it charges for credit card transactions. Neither company has confirmed any changes to the service fees. Visa Canada had previously said it offered Walmart Canada one of the lowest transaction processing rates of any merchant in Canada. “Walmart is still demanding more. They believe that their cost to accept Visa cards should be much lower than all other merchants -- lower than local grocery stores, pharmacies, convenience stores -- and yes, charities and schools too,” said the company in an open letter to Canadian merchants last June. “They are using their size and scale to give themselves an unfair advantage.” Visa fired back against Walmart during the dispute by offering Manitoba cardholders a $10 credit on $50 grocery purchases. Thunder Bay, Ont. cardholders were awarded a $25 credit for every grocery buy of $75 or more. “We have come to an agreement with Visa which allows us to continuing offering Visa as a form of payment in our stores,” said Walmart Canada’s senior director of corporate affairs Alex Roberton in an emailed statement to CTV News. Visa Canada’s corporate and public affairs spokesperson Carla Hindman echoed Roberton’s message, saying “Visa cardholders can once again use their Visa credit cards as a form of payment in all Walmart stores across Canada.” Related Stories Customer credit latest move in Visa Canada-Walmart card-rate spat Fees dispute escalates as Walmart stops accepting Visa in Manitoba Why is Walmart phasing out Visa transactions in Canada?

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen TORONTO – Corporate behemoths Walmart Canada and Visa have declared a truce in their dispute over merchant fees, allowing Walmart customers in Manitoba and Thunder Bay, Ont., to resume using the credit card beginning Friday. Story continues below In statement’s sent to Global News, both Walmart and Visa said they “came to an agreement” but did not list the details of the agreement. Walmart began refusing Visa credit cards at its three stores in Thunder Bay in mid-July. It said it pays more than $100 million in fees every year for customers to use various brands of credit cards, and that the fees charged by Visa were excessive. READ MORE: Walmart vs. Visa: Canadians side with retail giant in fee dispute, poll says That set off a widely watched battle within the retail sector that intensified in October, when Walmart expanded its policy of rejecting Visas to its 16 stores in Manitoba. The retail giant had said it was planning to expand its phase-out of Visa to all of its 400 stores in Canada. The months-long dispute became so heated that at one point Visa offered its cardholders in Manitoba a reward for buying their groceries somewhere other than Walmart. It launched an advertising campaign in November offering Manitoba Visa cardholders a $10 credit if they spent $50 or more at grocery stores. The campaign didn’t explicitly mention Walmart or the fee dispute, but a Visa spokeswoman said at the time that the company was hoping to ease any inconvenience for Visa cardholders who can’t use their cards everywhere that they want to. Visa ran a similar ad in Thunder Bay, promising cardholders there with a $25 credit for every grocery purchase of $75 or more. Visa previously said it had offered Walmart one of the lowest rates for any merchant in the country, and that if it gave in to the retailer’s demands then other merchants would want a reduction in their fees, as well. *With Files from Global News   © 2017 The Canadian Press Report an error Credit Cards Transaction Fees VISA Walmart Walmart Canada walmart visa battle walmart vs visa Editor's Picks Canada Fake news: A real-life Cruella de Vil didn't skin dozens of Texas cats Canada Why Justin Trudeau’s trip to the Aga Khan’s island matters Consumer No, you do not have to pay a 'settlement fee' if you get an illegal download notice Health Trump's support for anti-vaxxers could lead to deadly outbreaks, disease expert warns Canada Why is Canada's top diplomat, Chrystia Freeland, banned from Russia?

(Chris Hondros/Getty Images) Related Stories The Walmart-Visa standoff: Who's winning? New front open in Walmart's war with Visa, as cards will soon be banned in Manitoba Walmart goes Visa free in Manitoba next month Walmart extends Visa ban to all 16 Manitoba stores starting today Want 10 bucks? Then buy your groceries somewhere other than Walmart, Visa tells Manitobans Walmart goes Visa free in Manitoba A six-month spat between the world's largest retailer and the world's biggest credit card company is over, as Walmart has struck a deal with Visa that will see the latter's cards accepted at all of the chain's Canadian stores. The two companies announced the agreement on Thursday, but made no mention as to what concessions were made by whom to end the dispute. Two months after first shot, Walmart still quiet on battle plan in Visa war "Visa cardholders can once again use their Visa credit cards as a form of payment in all Walmart stores across Canada," Visa Canada spokeswoman Carla Hindman said in an email. Starting tomorrow, "Visa credit cards will be accepted at all Canadian Walmart stores, including in Manitoba and Thunder Bay, Ont." Those two markets were singled out because they are the only locations thus far affected by Walmart's threat, made last June, to eventually stop accepting Visa cards at all of its stores. The move to drop Visa started at all three Walmart stores in Thunder Bay in July and then spread to all 16 stores in Manitoba in October. Interchange fees At issue were so-called interchange fees, which credit card companies charge retailers as a cost for processing a transaction. Typically they are a percentage of the total value of goods sold, but different cards and different stores have different rates. While consumers don't pay those fees directly, retailers pass on the costs to shoppers via higher prices. Walmart's Visa ban extends from Ontario into Manitoba Visa offers Manitobans $10 to buy their groceries anywhere but Walmart Walmart had insisted that Visa's fees are too high, saying it pays more than $100 million a year for the service — far more than it pays for other cards, or other payment methods such as debit, which charges a flat fee per transaction. Visa, meanwhile, countered that it already gave Walmart one of its lowest interchange fees on all its cards. Neither side was willing to disclose on Thursday what the new fee structure for Visa cards at Walmart will be, but data from research firm Value Penguin suggests the average interchange fee on Canadian credit cards is roughly 1.76 per cent. That's far higher than those in Europe, where fees below one per cent are the norm. The French average, for example, is just 0.21 per cent. According to payment processing firm Moneris, as of April 2015, Visa's internal guidelines said their cards charged between 1.42 and 2.08 per cent in interchange fees, depending on the card used, at a standard retailer. Although the company would likely negotiate another deal with a customer the size of Walmart. Visa fights back in high-profile fight with Walmart over credit card fees Mark Satov, strategy adviser at Satov Consultants, said the timing of the deal — right after the busy holiday shopping season — was likely significant. "It's after Christmas and somebody looked at their numbers and said, 'It wasn't as strong as we thought,'" he said in an interview. "And my bet is it's Visa." Satov suggested the card company had more to lose in the long run from feuding with a giant retailer such as Walmart. "People don't look for the best deal to find the cheapest TV or gadget or toy and then say, 'I'm not going there, they don't take Visa,'" he said. "That's not the way people think." From 2014: Banks, credit card companies agree to cut fees they charge retailers The card company also likely faced pressure from its banking partners to get a deal done, because Visa is a brand, but the payments themselves are processed by whatever Canadian bank has issued the card. When it comes to which credit cards to issue to their customers, "the bank has a choice [and] if Visa is not accepted at one of the biggest retailers in the country, it's not attractive anymore," Satov said.

Editor’s note: All suspects are presumed to be innocent until proven guilty in a court of law, and values are estimated for stolen/damaged items. These are brief summaries of detailed BPD reports. Dec. 26 Stage Road and Memphis-Arlington Road (fraud) A man reported the day after Christmas that someone had used his debit card twice without his permission. The first was on Dec. 19 at Walmart (8400 Stage Road) for $85.61. The second use was the same day at another Walmart (6420 Memphis Arlington Road) for $112.44. North Street (theft from yard) A package thief took a UPS package from the front porch of a home on North Street sometime after 1:45 p.m. on Dec. 24, the homeowner reported on Dec. 26. The item stolen was a high-power nine-jet ultrasonic fogger/mister/humidifier ($150). Dec. 27 Steven Franklin Drive (home invasion) A woman reported on Dec. 27 that a friend armed with a black handgun, along with another acquaintance and two unknown white males, unlawfully entered her home between midnight and 12:30 a.m. , but they quickly left the residence. She said the friend he had stolen her car and keys on Dec. 24 from a hotel in Memphis, and she believes he used those keys to enter her home. The vehicle that the home invaders used wasn’t the one that was stolen from her, she said. Carla Lane (theft from motor vehicle) A man reported on Dec. 27 that someone had rummaged through his truck bed storage box the previous day. He parked his Ford F150 pickup in the driveway around 8 p.m., and he noticed the intrusion at 7:20 a.m. the next morning. The storage box’s contents were emptied out into the truck bed, and the only item missing was a small duffle bag containing paperwork and documents. Peyton Randolph (auto burglary) A victim reported on Dec. 27 that someone stole multiple items from a Saturn Outlook and Toyota Corolla parked in the home’s driveway. Items taken included a TomTom brand GPS device and a Craftsman toolbox ($45) filled with face painting brushes and paints ($350). The thefts happened between 7 p.m. Dec. 26 and 10:15 a.m. Dec. 27. Skylight Drive (theft) Someone removed the temporary tag from a 2010 Nissan Altima, the owner reported on Dec. 27. She said she parks the car on the street in front of her home. The theft happened between noon Dec. 25 and 1 p.m. Dec. 27. Dec. 28 Chesterfield Cove (theft from motor vehicle) On Dec. 28, a gun owner reported a weapon stolen from his vehicle. Items taken included a black Glock 43 handgun ($500), eight 9mm bullets ($5) and a black Remora handgun holster ($40). He noticed the theft the day of the report and said the weapon was stolen sometime within the past two weeks. During that period, he traveled to Nashville and Johnson City, but he believes the weapon was stolen from his vehicle while it was parked at home. He said he normally locks his vehicle but may have forgotten to do so a couple of times. Stage Road (theft from motor vehicle) A man returned from a meal on Dec. 28 to find his car’s keyhole had been punched and multiple items were stolen. He parked around 6:10 p.m. in the parking lot of 5705 Stage Road, ate dinner and returned around two hours later. The driver’s side keyhole was destroyed, along with his dashboard. His Kenwood DDC 790 radio ($500) was missing. Other stolen items included a camouflage backpack ($100) containing miscellaneous medical supplies ($100), a black iPhone 5s ($400) and two JL Audio 10-inch speakers ($500). A witness reported seeing a white male and an Asian male, both about 19-24 years old, in the area before the incident. Dec. 29 Court Street (attempted burglary) A man went outside when he heard noise in his backyard around 9:10 p.m. on Dec. 29, and he spotted someone running away. The suspect—a slim male wearing a black hoodie and black pants—climbed over the chicken wire fence and fled westbound on North Street. The man also found that the window screen had been removed from his home’s rear window. Dec. 30 Trey Hobbs Cove (burglary) A woman taking care of someone else’s dogs around 3:45 p.m. Dec. 30 found that the home had been burglarized. Items taken included a 60-inch Magnavox and a 42-inch TV of unknown make/model ($800). Officers cleared the property and found that the entry door from the garage had been pried open from an unknown object. They also noticed a small amount of drug paraphernalia in plain view, and it was photographed and later destroyed. Dec. 31 4th Avenue (suspicious circumstance) A woman reported on Dec. 31 that her back door had been pried open. She said the last time they had seen the door undamaged was around 8 p.m. Dec. 30, when her husband took the dogs outside. The family discovered the damage around 5 a.m. Dec. 31. She said she hadn’t noticed if anything was missing from the home.

Police in Marietta arrested 26-year-old Timothy Blake on Dec. 30 during an investigation of two alleged acts of public masturbation and stalking, according to CBS News. Washington County Sheriffs Office Timothy Blake, 26, is accused of squirting semen on women shopping at a Walmart in Marietta, Ohio. The first incident was on Nov. 2, when a woman shopping at the local Walmart called police to report a “creepy” man who seemed to be lingering around her, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by The Smoking Gun. The victim told police the man walked up a few inches behind her, and then she felt something wet on her lower back and foot. The woman then “began to panic” and rushed to a bathroom where she discovered the substance was “sticky.” She walked out and saw the man who allegedly assaulted her continuing to watch her. “She said he then took off and she followed him until he got in his truck and left,” Washington County Sheriff Larry Mincks told the Parkersburg News and Sentinel. Surveillance video obtained by the police showed the suspect squirting the woman. The second incident happened Dec. 28 at the same Walmart. The victim told police that “some substance” had been “thrown or sprayed on her” while she was shopping, according to the arrest affidavit. The suspect was spotted driving away in a truck with an emblem on the side. Surveillance footage revealed that he was identical to the suspect in the November incident. Investigators used the emblem on the truck to track down Blake at a Wings Etc. location on Dec. 30. The suspect was seated inside, but came outside to the patrol vehicle to talk. When Blake was told he had been seen throwing or spraying something on women at the Walmart, he allegedly told officers he had tossed egg yolks. Blake was then informed that the substance found on the women had been tested, at which point he allegedly admitted he had squirted semen on the women, according to the arrest affidavit. The suspect allegedly told police he had done similar acts about a dozen times, but only used sperm on four occasions, and used egg yolks and flour or spit the other times.  Blake allegedly blamed his behavior on being molested as a child by his parents. Police also said he told them he masturbated in his truck or in the Walmart bathroom before his alleged acts, and used syringes he had purchased for the purpose of inoculating farm animals. Law enforcement also alleged that Blake said he usually aimed for the buttocks area of his victims and felt it was his way of having sex with them. He was charged with pandering obscenity, sexual imposition and two counts of menace by stalking. He has a preliminary hearing Jan. 11, but is currently free on $11,000 bond and was ordered to wear a GPS ankle monitor, according to WTAP. Anyone who experienced something similar at the Marietta Walmart is asked to contact the Washington County Sheriff’s Office at 740-376-7070, ext. 0.

(Courtesy, Haines City Police Department) By Stephanie Claytor, Reporter Last Updated: Friday, January 06, 2017, 9:03 AM EST HAINES CITY --  A mother of two was shot after an argument at a Haines City Walmart Thursday morning.  Mandy Guzman, 30, was shot in the abdomen Thursday morning Police: mother of two got into an argument with Yajaira Rivera while shopping Yajaira Rivera, 37, turned herself in to authorities According to acting Haines City Police Chief Jay Hopwood, Mandy Nicole Guzman, 30, was shot in the stomach following a confrontation in the Walmart on US Hwy 27 and Southern Dunes Blvd just after 11:30 a.m.  Police say Guzman got into an argument with Yajaira Rivera, 37, while inside the store. The pair parted ways, police say, and Guzman completed her shopping, then loaded her belongings and children into her vehicle. She was in the process of pushing her cart to the cart return rack when police say Rivera shot her. They have reportedly known each other for 'a few years.' When paramedics and officers arrived, Guzman was reportedly in the passenger seat of her car suffering from a gunshot wound. She was conscious and stable when airlifted to the hospital, Chief Hopwood said. Authorities also say her children were not injured during the shooting, and police don't believe they witnessed the crime.  Yajaira Rivera reportedly turned herself in to her attorney Thursday evening. She's currently being booked into jail on attempted homicide charges. &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp; Polk County: Latest News Auburndale church to honor fallen Orlando police officer Winter Haven mother and daughter safe after fire destroyed home 'Clearly People' art exhibition set for downtown Lakeland Missing 75-year-old from Winter Haven found Lakeland transitional school for dyslexic children expanding Lakeland man hit, killed while crossing street Polk man to spend life in prison for raping, impregnating young girl Historical Commission votes to keep Polk monument at current site Man dies in Winter Haven house fire StormTracker 13 Radar Learn more  |  BHTV for iOS  |  BHTV for Android  |  BHTV for Kindle Fire  |  PC/Laptop Get the News 13+ App Download the News 13+ app for the latest News, Weather and Real Time Traffic at your fingertips.

Timothy Blake "repeatedly stalked" women inside an Ohio Walmart before squirting them with semen, CBS News reported Wednesday. Blake, authorities say, first told police he had thrown egg yolks at the victims but later admitted the substance was semen. "The defendant stated maybe it was his way of having sex with these women," Marietta police wrote in the arrest affidavit. The first report of such incidents was received in November. A woman told authorities she was at Walmart when she noticed a "creepy" man who appeared to be "lingering around" as she attempted to shop. The man then approached her from behind, at which point she noticed a wet substance on her lower back and foot. After washing off the substance in a nearby restroom, the man was allegedly seen waiting on the woman. A similar report was received in December, with surveillance tapes reportedly showing the man fleeing the scene in a pickup truck. The truck was later discovered by police, leading to Blake—the owner of the vehicle—being questioned. Surveillance tapes also captured Blake using the syringe to squirt the woman who was stalked in November. Blake, 26, was ultimately booked and charged Dec. 30 with sexual imposition, pandering obscenity, and two counts of menace by stalking. According to the New York Daily News, Blake said he had previously used syringes full of either “egg, spit, or semen” to squirt women on a dozen occasions. Blake, who is married, reportedly blamed his parents for the behavior and accused them of molesting him as a child. Sadly, this doesn't mark the first incident of its kind.

Walmart’s Jet.com Jumping Into Shoe Game With $70M Purchase Of ShoeBuy Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart’s Jet.com Jumping Into Shoe Game With $70M Purchase Of ShoeBuy January 5, 2017 11:41 am EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler buy all the shoes amazon walmart jet.com ShoeBuy shoes shopping online Acquisition deal Following the $3 billion purchase of Jet.com, Walmart is continuing its bid to boost online sales, this time by targeting customers’ feet with the $70 million purchase of shoe-tailer ShoeBuy.  Walmart announced Thursday that Jet.com had acquired Boston-based online shoe retailer ShoeBuy on Dec. 30. The purchase is aimed at expanding Jet.com’s reach in consumers’ lives, including their closets. Walmart says the deal will allow Jet to gain the experience of a “well-established ecommerce player in the footwear industry.” With the deal, ShoeBuy will operate as a standalone site, and current CEO Mike Sorabella and the company’s 200 employees will continue to be based in Boston. ShoeBuy suppliers that are interested in expanding their consumer reach through selling on Jet will have that option. The purchase is just the latest in Walmart’s push for online sales. In Aug. 2016, the retailer announced would officially acquire Jet.com. A month later, the company was reportedly thinking of making a $1 billion investment in India-Based Flipkart to take on Amazon overseas. These types of purchases aren’t likely to stop anytime soon. Jet co-founder and CEO Marc Lore told Recode in an interview that it was a “fair assumption” that the company and Walmart would pursue more of acquisitions of online retailers, likely in “categories where they are long-tail, high-martian products and harder-to-crack brands.” January 5, 2017 By Ashlee Kieler@akieler buy all the shoes amazon walmart jet.com ShoeBuy shoes shopping online Acquisition deal Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related the other kind of deal Walmart Officially Acquiring Jet.com For $3 Billion focusing online Walmart Shuffles Staff To Take Online Sales Seriously… For Real This Time one way to boost sales Report: Walmart In Talks To Buy Jet.com the honeymoon is over What Should Walmart Do Now That It’s Landed Jet.com? gaining on Amazon Walmart May Invest $1B In Flipkart To Fight Amazon Overseas Previous You Can Drive A Different Cadillac Every Day — If You’ve Got An Extra $1,500/Month Next Chipotle Launches “Dietary Options” Tool For Better Burrito Personalization Part of  Founded in 2005, Consumerist is an independent source of consumer news and information published by Consumer Media LLC, a not-for-profit subsidiary of Consumer Reports.

The move underscores Walmart's continued push against Amazon, owner of online shoe store Zappos. The biggest retailer in the world, Walmart made online expansion its priority last year, taking over Jet for $3.3 billion and setting up a plan to invest billions more into e-commerce while cutting down new store openings. Jet said it bought ShoeBuy through its parent Walmart from media and internet company IAC, in a deal that closed Dec. 30. It said ShoeBuy is a leading online seller of shoes, clothes and accessories, stocking more than a million items. ShoeBuy will operate as a standalone site, but its suppliers have the option of expanding to sales on Jet too, the company said. ShoeBuy CEO Mike Sorabella, his executive team and the company's more than 200 employees will continue to be based in Boston, Massachusetts.

Walmart announced Thursday morning that Jet has acquired ShoeBuy.com, a Boston-based footwear ecommerce company that was one of the first to sell shoes online when it launched in 1999. Jet paid about $70 million to buy ShoeBuy from its now-former parent company, IAC, Walmart said in a press release. As a result of the acquisition, ShoeBuy will remain a standalone site. The company's CEO, Mike Sorabella, along with his executive team and more than 200 employees, will stay in Boston. ShoeBuy had been acquired by IAC in 2006. Through the acquisition, Jet will gain the experience of a company that has played the ecommerce game longer than most. When ShoeBuy was founded by Scott Savitz in 1999, it was only four years after Amazon.com had launched. Savitz left in 2011 and formed Data Point Capital, a Boston-based venture capital firm that recently added Leonardo DiCaprio as a limited partner. ShoeBuy sells more than 800 brands, with over one million items spanning footwear, clothing and accessories for men, women and children — brands that will now have a chance to sell directly through Jet because of the acquisition, Walmart said.

AP Images. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is upping the digital ante. Just five months after the retail giant picked up e-commerce site Jet.com, Walmart said today that its new digital arm has snapped up online footwear, clothing and accessories retailer ShoeBuy. Related Texas Mother Claims to Have Found Razor Blades in Kid's Shoes at Walmart Jet.com shelled out $70 million for  16-year-old Boston-based ShoeBuy and expects the site to operate as a standalone but complementary component to Jet.com. The company said ShoeBuy CEO Mike Sorabella, his executive team and 200-plus employees will continue to be based in Boston. Walmart, which has felt heightened competitive pressure from e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc., has been moving aggressively over the past few months to expand its digital reach. According to the company, ShoeBuy — which became one of the first companies to sell shoes online around the same time that Zappos launched — carries more than 800 brands and over 1 million items, including footwear for women, men and kids, as well as clothing and accessories, such as outerwear and handbags. Hoboken, N.J.-based Jet.com sells a wide range of products, including electronics, furniture, specialty foods, household and beauty items. It also carries a smaller assortment of clothes, shoes and accessories. ShoeBuy’s suppliers interested in selling their wares on Jet.com will now have that option, according to the company. “Jet will gain the experience of a well-established e-commerce player in the footwear industry, who has transformed the online shopping experience for millions of customers,” Walmart said in statement. “ShoeBuy brings access to a large assortment of products, strong industry relationships, and rich content that will further enhance our customer experience.” Jet.com acquired ShoeBuy from IAC.

Jamier Sale has helped mobilize numerous protests in Sacramento, but the recent dealings he and several other leaders in the city’s activist community have had with authorities cast a shadow on how the First Amendment plays out locally.

Advertisement Five days from now, activist Maile Hampton is scheduled to stand trial for the crime of touching a fellow protester’s arm for a handful of seconds in January 2015. And the future of Sacramento’s protest community could be shaped by the outcome. The charge facing Hampton is one of misdemeanor obstruction of a peace officer. The majority of misdemeanor allegations never see an actual trial, as judges and lawyers prefer to reserve limited taxpayer resources for exploring serious criminal accusations. But when tensions between activists and law enforcement do erupt into charges, Sacramento prosecutors are more likely than their counterparts in one nearby jurisdiction to take small-time infractions and misdemeanors the full distance, even to costly jury trials, according to records obtained by SN&R and interviews with multiple activists and attorneys. The intent is unmistakable, they claim: Speak out and pay fines. Embarrass the political elite and go to jail. “I do think handing out these kinds of charges to someone involved in a social movement is a very practical way of having a chilling effect on their First Amendment rights,” said veteran defense attorney Linda Parisi, who is representing Hampton. Hampton’s impending trial isn’t the only courtroom drama pushing this theme, however. Sean Thompson, an advocate for the homeless, is staring down a felony assault charge for smearing former Mayor Kevin Johnson with a cream pie. Veteran labor activist Eric Sunderland spent two years in Sacramento’s criminal court system for standing in the wrong spot during a Wal-Mart protest. And Hampton’s brother Jamier Sale has paid hundreds of dollars in fines for strolling too slow through a crosswalk during a demonstration—not to mention being informally banned from the Sacramento International Airport for protesting Donald Trump’s campaign stop there in June. Hampton, Sale, Sunderland and Thompson are all well-known organizers in Sacramento’s protest community. Whether that’s just a coincidence or a pathfinder for what constitutes unusual treatment and selective enforcement, it’s having a stifling effect, protest leaders say. “Compared to other cities, Sacramento’s protests are small,” Sale said in an interview with SN&R. “We have activists who are out, but they’re a small group and part of that is because people keep hearing about these things that are happening to us. People wonder, ’Why is the protest community so small in Sacramento?’” Sale said in an interview with SN&R. “This is why.” When it comes to jury trials for misdemeanor obstruction charges, Sacramento County prosecutors waged more than three times as many as prosecutors in Alameda County, a political hotbed with a similar population and demographics, according to a review of court data obtained by SN&R. In all, Sacramento County’s halls of justice were the site of 1,089 criminal jury trials between January 2014 and October 2016. Exactly 24 of those were held to determine the guilt or innocence of a person charged with a misdemeanor count of obstructing a peace officer—the same charge Hampton faces for touching another protestor for a few seconds. That means cases like Hampton’s represented 2.2 percent of all jury trials in Sacramento County in nearly three years. While misdemeanor obstruction trials are uncommon in Sacramento, records obtained by SN&R suggest local prosecutors are hauling far more individuals in front of juries for the charge than their counterparts in Alameda County, the California jurisdiction most similar to Sacramento in population size. Alameda Superior Court held only seven jury trials for misdemeanor obstruction in the last three years, less than a third of Sacramento’s 24. That’s significant since it’s a charge often connected to demonstrating. Sacramento County Chief Deputy District Attorney Steve Grippi confirmed in an email that misdemeanor obstruction is one of several violations his office can file for protest arrests, though he denied that bringing a higher rate of those cases to jury trials proves harsh treatment for activists. “While resisting or interfering with a lawful arrest can often be associated with unlawful assembly arrests, the vast majority of [those cases] have absolutely nothing to do with protestors and demonstrators,” Grippi noted. The DA’s office didn’t provide case logs to back up that claim, but SN&R is aware of one such case. In December 2015, the DA’s office won a jury conviction for misdemeanor obstruction against a North Sacramento couple who refused to exit their home to a SWAT team platoon there to investigate false claims of a gun stash. While no firearms were found, the couple was arrested for refusing to accommodate the raid. Grippi also contended that the state capital is a bastion for activism, making legal confrontations more likely. “Sacramento County sees an inordinate share of political protests and demonstrations,” Grippi wrote. “Despite that reality, we do not charge an excessive number of so-called protest cases.” Yet the proposition that local law enforcement deals with more dissidents than their collegues in Alameda County is a shaky one: Between 2014 and October 2016, Bay Area news organizations reported more than 50 different demonstrations from the streets of Oakland to the UC Berkeley campus, some of which included crowds ranging from 200 to 2,000 activists blocking freeways, shutting down the Port of Oakland and laying on train tracks. One even included widespread public nudity. Attorney Todd Leras, who’s worked both as a local and federal prosecutor, said the yearslong court cases and jury trials he’s now seeing as a defense attorney fly in the face of campaign promises District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert made when the two competed for office in 2014. “When we were at a debate, she made comments that she wasn’t going to waste time prosecuting people for peaceful protests,” Leras said. “Regardless of what conversations she’s involved with around these cases, the prosecutors in her office are not keeping her campaign promises.” The stance that local prosecutors take toward activists came under national scrutiny during the early phases of Hampton’s case. The ordeal started at a Black Lives Matter event near the capital in January 2015, when Hampton put a hand on a fellow protestor who was being grabbed by police. Video evidence shows Hampton touched the man out of concern, for less than three seconds. While police never ended up arresting the man who was between Hampton and the officers, that didn’t stop them from later taking Hampton into custody at home on a felony charge of “lynching” him out of their custody. Parisi said the charge against Hampton wasn’t a case of a lone police officer being creative: It actually took Parisi several court appearances to convince the DA’s office of how inappropriate the lynching allegation was. Meanwhile, news that a 20-year-old, multiracial resident had to appear in court for “lynching” triggered a national uproar. California lawmakers and Gov. Jerry Brown unanimously changed the age-old state law that year, divorcing the historic connotation of lynching from the crime of prying another person from the hands of police. The DA’s office eventually dropped the racially-charged violation against Hampton, but quietly kept the case going by pursuing the lesser misdemeanor obstruction charge. Grippi declined to discuss the details of Hampton’s case or the impending trial, which is scheduled to begin January 10. Parisi told SN&R the costly event is going forward because prosecutors have yet to offer Hampton what the defense considers to be a reasonable plea bargain. The attorney added that the case is complicated by the fact that Hampton was exercising personal rights as an activist during the incident. “Peaceful protests and the right to expression are part of the foundation of a democratic society,” Parisi said. Prosecutors gave Sunderland his own reason to rethink his activism. The labor organizer was one of several people cited for obstructing traffic during a protest at the Wal-Mart in Rancho Cordova in 2014. When he and the other ticket recipients showed up to traffic court, prosecutors announced they were re-filing the infractions as more serious misdemeanor crimes. It took two full years for a volunteer team of defense attorneys to obtain an acceptable plea deal and prevent taxpayers from footing the bill for a trial. Leras represented Sunderland and was surprised by the level of pressure from his former colleagues. “I can tell you that myself and the other defense attorneys thought the district attorney’s office was being absolutely ridiculous and punitive,” Leras recalled. “The court itself finally made its own offer to settle the case, because it was clear the matter didn’t deserve this much attention.” Sale wasn’t as fortunate in 2014, when he had his most memorable brush with authorities. Sale was among some 200 demonstrators making a show against police brutality outside the Arden Fair mall when police grabbed him—and only him—in the crosswalk to be cited for jaywalking. Sale later appeared in court with witnesses, photos and videos to prove he was inside the crosswalk. Sale would never get the chance to defend himself. According to an appeal filed in 2015 by attorney Jeffrey Kravitz, when Sale showed up to address the ticket, Judge Patricia C. Esgro allowed a Sacramento police officer to simply alter his charge as they stood there. The violation was switched from jaywalking to obstructing traffic. The appeal states that swapping the charge was done without warning to Sale, and that Esgro abused her judicial discretion by failing to instruct Sale of his legal rights and options. The appeal also claimed that Sale was not allowed to present witnesses and evidence in his defense before Esgro found him guilty. Cres Vellucci of the National Lawyers Guild, the oldest U.S. bar association formed around protecting civil rights, watched Sale’s hearing unfold. “Each time Jamier tried to explain himself to the judge, he was cut off,” Vellucci said. “It was just a matter of the judge telling him that he was guilty.” Since Sale’s case was handled in traffic court, the constitutional right to be represented by an attorney didn’t apply. Sale was fined $250, plus an extra $50 fee to have a payment plan implemented. He has come to refer to that fine as his “personal protest tax,” owed to the city of Sacramento. “I don’t have $300 just lying around, but it’s still a small price to pay,” Sale told SN&R. “They can cite us for all these little things, but it won’t stop us from being out here to do what we think is right.” The nexus between personal convictions and criminal prosecutions is at the forefront of Thompson’s story. The military veteran made headlines in September by sidling up to the former mayor with a pie and drenching his face with coconut cream. Johnson responded by reportedly punching Thompson multiple times. While the level of Thompson’s culpability in the incident is debated (Johnson faced no charges for throwing blows), a recent preliminary hearing reinforced for Thompson that his fate in court is intertwined with his position as an activist. Thompson had spoken out numerous times about his belief that Johnson and other city leaders have pushed callous and dismissive policies toward their homeless constituents. He ultimately decided to make a public statement about the mayor with a soft, fluffy dessert not known for inflicting injuries. On November 3, Thompson’s attorney, Claire White, walked into the preliminary hearing with hopes of getting the assault charge dropped from a felony to a misdemeanor. Deputy District Attorney Anthony Ortiz argued for keeping the legal stakes as high as possible for Thompson. It was a position White told Judge Paul Seave made no sense given what usually constitutes a felony assault in California. “The felonies we see in cases with this charge are for vicious attacks where significant injuries are sustained,” White asserted. “We have a young man who squashed a pie in someone’s face. This is textbook misdemeanor behavior.” Ortiz’s counter argument offered a rare glimpse into the district attorney’s approach to pursuing charges against political dissenters. Addressing the judge, Ortiz acknowledged that Johnson’s claim of getting “whiplash” from the pastry wasn’t the only reason for wanting a felony assault charge upheld. The prosecutor pointed to Thompson’s current activism as a motivating factor in keeping the charge severe. “Even after this incident happened, he called the mayor an asshole—he referred to him as a clown,” Ortiz said in closing statements. “The defendant has shown no remorse.” Legally, remorse can be a mitigating factor judges and prosecutors consider when weighing the severity of charges or sentencing. Ortiz stressed that Thompson’s decision not to renounce his political statement about Johnson was an element of the prosecutor’s refusal to sign off on lowering his charges. Seave ultimately sided with the DA’s office. Walking out of the courtroom, a surprised White told her client, “I guess they want a real fight.” It’s a fight the taxpayers will have to finance. For the National Lawyers Guild, the common thread linking Sale, Hampton and Thompson is that they’re all considered leaders within the local activist community. “Jamier Sale and Maile Hampton happen to be individuals who have helped organize some of these events. It’s not a secret,” Vellucci noted. “Sean Thompson had been arrested for protesting numerous times, and he was well-known as a key activist before the pie incident with the mayor.” Sunderland’s activism has been even better documented by Sacramento media. When asked if county prosecutors ever discuss with arresting officers whether a defendant is perceived as a leader at a protest event, Grippi declined to give a direct answer. His email did state that the office recognizes the importance of the First Amendment. “We are cognizant of the vital role of protest in American democracy and strive to evaluate potential charges related to conduct occurring during demonstrations with sensitivity to the importance of free speech and dissent,” Grippi wrote. “We also recognize there will be those who will exercise their right to disagree with charging decisions. … This, too, is part of a healthy democracy.” On a corner of the capital lawn, during a recent protest against the next president, Sale thought of Hampton and decided the pieces don’t add up. “How many of our public resources are being used to hold this misdemeanor trial for my sister?” he wondered aloud. “The only reason they would spend all that money is to try to dissuade people from protesting.” Tweet Contact us about this story RELATED LINKS: See all stories published in News See all stories published in Local Stories Reader Comments Displaying 2 comments.

( no matter if they be 1st or 8th) whose “hand are tied” will not budge on my misdemeanor charges, trying to subject a hard working mother with no prior record to 90 days jail time. Again the judge feels this is extream. I can never forget how, unprofessional the two officer I meet that night, where. I still can’t forget the look the officer gave me when he heard me tell the nurse my HIV status. The way the courts, and jail have manipulated an ill man, and knowingly exposed other inmates to infectious blood. The way they show no common decency, nor respect for their fellow man, is deplorable. I have lost more faith in humanity living and working in Sacramento, than Baltimore. It is due to the legal system, the people among us who’s job is :to protect and serve. I pray for those who have found them self afflicted by the corruption. LESS Sign in to submit a comment: e-mail: password: Don't have a login yet? Join now!, it's fast and free! Help!

News World Donald Trump is right: Silicon Valley needs to invest in America If tech companies agree to put a modest amount of money into projects outside their own sector, they will create jobs, bolster communities and contribute to greater social cohesion in America – Trump is right to nudge them to do so Kevin Maney Monday 2 January 2017 11:45 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Mike Pence listens as Donald Trump addresses tech chiefs in New York last month. From left: Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Google parent Alphabet’s Larry Page and Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg Getty When Donald Trump met with technology leaders in December to tell them he wanted them to create jobs in the US, their heads probably tilted to the side, as if you tried to explain physics to your dog and she just watched your lips moving and wondered when, among all those unfamiliar sounds, she was going to hear the word “treat”. Tech leaders aren’t in the business of creating jobs. They’re in business to help us do more with less. They like innovation and disruption and software eating the world but people – er, not so much. In his own Chance-the-gardener way, the President-elect might be on to something. His victory was a middle-finger salute from those who feeling left out by technology and globalisation. The tech industry’s trend is toward leaving more people out by automating yet more lower-level jobs while creating only high-skilled jobs. It’s becoming clear that if tech doesn’t change that trajectory, the consequences might look something like the Visigoths attacking Rome in 410. Apple chief executive Tim Cook, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Alphabet’s Larry Page and a bunch of their peers slinked into Trump Tower on 14 December for a meeting with the President-elect, who doesn’t use a computer, probably has never used Uber and no doubt thinks team messaging app Slack is what he finds at the tips of his gloves. If you can imagine how top neurosurgeons would react to a lecture on the brain by a TV chef – well, that’s how the tech leaders must have felt in this session. Trump praised the chief executives for the great work they do but once the doors closed, he reportedly told the group they need to create more US jobs – and not just for artificial intelligence specialists in Silicon Valley. He apparently emphasised that to make a difference, tech would need to invest in boots-on-the-ground jobs in the middle of the country. Tech companies have changed the employment landscape in the US (Getty) He’s right, in that tech companies played a have major role in creating the yawning wealth gap between digital America and analogue America. Look at one indicator: revenue-per-employee across different industries. Wal-Mart, which operates staff-intensive retail stores spread across the planet, employs 2.1 million people. Its revenue per employee stays pretty constant at $220,000 (£180,000). General Motors, a major manufacturer, does better: its revenue per employee is around £570,000. Now look at Facebook. Its revenue per employee is $1.4m, double GM’s. Apple bludgeons Facebook’s performance with $2.1m in revenue for each person who works there – 10 times that of Wal-Mart. But…Apple, the most valuable company in America, directly employs just 66,000 – the number of people who go to see a typical NFL game. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart’s stock is about the same price it was in 2012. At companies such as Facebook and Apple, far more money is flowing into far fewer hands. And most of those hands are in tech corridors in California’s Bay Area or the north-east. It’s hard to completely blame tech chief executives for this disparity. This is how business is set up in America. We reward productivity and efficiency – i.e. getting more from less. But Trump is asking business – as Steve Jobs might have put it – to think different. Trump is telling tech companies  numbers aren’t everything and don’t account for making a huge swath of the nation miserable. For that matter, the numbers won’t mean anything at all if the sense of being left out tears apart the social fabric and ignites a furious backlash. The disrupters might find themselves disrupted. And Trump’s right. IBM chief executive Ginni Rometty told the meeting her company will create 25,000 more jobs in the US. But her promise is a sign of tech’s obtuse thinking about jobs. Writing in USA Today a day before meeting Trump, Rometty said: “This is not about white collar vs. blue collar jobs but about the ‘new collar’ jobs that employers in many industries demand, but which remain largely unfilled.” She pointed out that 500,000 jobs are open in the tech sector because companies can’t find people with the right skills. But here’s essentially what Rometty and a whole lot of tech CEOs are saying – and I’m liberally paraphrasing, here: if only the unemployed and undereducated dumb asses would take some courses in Python coding, they could move to San Francisco, solve our programmer shortage and we’d pay them a hundred grand. Yet how realistic is that? The US is a highly educated society, and still just one-third of Americans are university graduates. A large swath of the country will never find their way into the tech ecosystem. And, by the way, a lot of people actually want to live in places that have little traffic and an absence of Asian-fusion vegan restaurants. Amazon is a huge employer with nearly 270,000 staff (Reuters) What can tech CEOs really do about jobs? There was vast wealth in that room with Trump, and there is so much more spread throughout the tech sector. The industry needs to promote the idea that some of its wealth should be deployed to build or keep alive schools, parks, bookstores, newspapers, orchestras, bowling alleys, small manufacturers or whatever else helps communities thrive and can’t be reduced to an artificial intelligence bot. The profit margins might suck, but if you can break even and sustain it, you’d be giving back in a way that helps the country and might even save your industry down the line. Jeff Bezos is setting a pretty good example. Amazon employs more people than most tech companies its size. The count today is 268,900, and Amazon’s revenue per employee is about £380,000 – less than GM’s. More significantly, in 2013 Bezos spent £200m to acquire The Washington Post. The Post is a terrible business. But it’s a public good, and it’s labour-intensive. Bezos is worth $66 billion, so to him the purchase was like you or me buying a pair of shoes. But Bezos took the kind of action there that can make a difference outside of technology. It’s an old-school way of thinking, but it deserves a new look. Back at the turn of the 20th century, one of the most progressive chief executives in America was a guy named George F Johnson. He ran Endicott-Johnson Shoes, then one of the biggest shoemakers in the world. Johnson built homes for his workers and sold them at cost. For the community, he built a library, a golf course, two hospitals and funded a minor league baseball team. When asked why he did such costly things, Johnson was known to say, “I’m out to make all I can of this concern, not take all I can out of it.” This was in my hometown. To this day, there are statues of Johnson there, and streets named after him. He is a legend and a hero. One hundred years from now, will anybody say the same about the people who met with Trump that day? © Newsweek More about: Silicon Valley Trump Donald Trump Talking points America Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

(WASHINGTON COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE) BY Elizabeth Elizalde NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, January 4, 2017, 10:17 PM A West Virginia man repeatedly stalked women at an Ohio Walmart and allegedly admitted to masturbating into syringes to squirt them with his semen, according to an arrest affidavit. Timothy Blake, 26, was charged on Dec. 30 with menace by stalking in connection to public masturbation incidents in the past two months. Ohio police said they received a report on Nov. 2 from a woman who said a "creepy" man followed her around Walmart, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by CBS News. The woman told police she felt something wet on her lower back and then rushed to the bathroom to clean up the sticky substance. When she came out, the man was already waiting and staring at her, the affidavit states. Off-duty NYPD cop busted for stealing soap from Newburgh Walmart Authorities received a similar report from another woman on Dec. 28. Police managed to track down Blake by reviewing surveillance footage from both incidents that showed him fleeing the scene in his white pickup truck. Police say Blake admitted to masturbating into the syringes before stalking women at an Ohio Walmart.  (Seth Perlman/AP) After taken into custody, Blake told police that he threw egg yolks at the women. He then came clean when police tested the substance to be semen. Blake allegedly admitted to masturbating into the syringes in his vehicle or the Walmart bathroom before aiming at his victims. “The defendant stated maybe it was his way of having sex with these women,” the affidavit states.

Michael Brandon Jemison turned himself in to authorities on Wednesday -- two days after the incident. He is charged with the murder of Justin Jones. #BREAKING Arrest made in #Tomball murder Michael Brandon Jemison charged with murder.

Surveillance video from Walmart showed Jemison and Jones arguing with each other, Tomball police said. According to investigators, Jemison hit Jones with the helmet, causing him to collapse inside the store. Jones died at the hospital. His girlfriend, Lindsey Stover, told ABC13 that Jones was withdrawing money to give a friend before the encounter with Jemison. She believes it was only about $60. "I don't think it was spur of the moment. This guy saw an old enemy," Stover said.

As a result, Walmart stock has logged a decent 7% return during the past 12 months. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr So might there be more gains? Well, for the most part, there are still major headwinds – and one is downright tough to gauge. That is, Donald Trump’s trade policies. So far, it looks like there could be a tariff of 5% to 10% on imports, which could be done fairly quickly with an executive action. The goal is to help spur manufacturing and promote an “America first” policy. But it will likely make Walmart stock far from first. According to InvestorPlace.com’s James Brumley, the company imports about $50 billion in Chinese goods. While a tariff of 5% to 10% may not seem like a lot, it could still come to $5 billion. This leaves WMT in a tough position, such as to make a decision on raising prices or take a hit on margins. And of course, the company’s margins are already razor-thin, with the net income representing about 3% of overall revenues. 7 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Could Double in 2017 It is not clear-cut if anything will happen, however. Let’s face it, the Republican party has a long history of being pro free-trade. So there will likely be considerable pushback. Oh, and there are many U.S. companies that will ramp up their lobbying efforts. Regardless, all this uncertainty will probably be a negative for Walmart stock. If anything, expect lots of headlines that will cause anxiety for investors. Other Problems With Walmart Yet this is not the only nagging issue with Walmart stock. Keep in mind that growth has been lackluster. From 2012 to 2016, there was a mere 8% increase. Furthermore, during this period WMT was only able to churn out a gain of 16%. By comparison, Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) logged a return of 47% and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) posted nearly a 100% increase. Part of the problem for WMT is that the revenue base is already massive, representing 7% of retail sales in the U.S. So it is downright tough to find revenue. It also does not help that about 55% of U.S. revenues for WMT comes from the groceries. The business has suffered from deflationary pressures as well as tough competitive forces — with fierce rivals like Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) — as the industry has consolidated.

Updated: January 15, 2017 @ 7:55 pm Full Forecast News Sports Obituaries Opinion Buy & Sell AP Business Highlights By The Associated Press Jan 6, 2017 0 ___ US adds 156K jobs; unemployment rate ticks up to 4.7 pct. WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in December, capping a year of slower but solid hiring. Friday's report from the Labor Department portrayed a job market that remains durable 7½ years after the recovery from the Great Recession began. Though the unemployment rate rose to 4.7 percent from a nine-year low of 4.6 percent, it did so for an encouraging reason: More people began looking for work. Because not all of them found jobs immediately, more people were counted as unemployed in December. Hourly pay jumped 2.9 percent from a year earlier, the sharpest increase in more than seven years. ___ Higher wages push stocks to records, but Dow misses 20,000 NEW YORK (AP) — So close! The Dow Jones industrial average missed the 20,000 mark by a fraction of a point Friday as U.S. stock indexes rose after the government said wages jumped in December. Two other major indexes set records. Stocks wavered between gains and losses in the morning after the December jobs report, which showed less hiring than analysts hoped to see. Bond yields rose sharply, as the continued job gains should encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates. Indexes turned higher as investors concluded that the rising wages will lead to more spending on technology and consumer goods. Industrial companies rose as investors hoped for greater economic growth. ___ US trade deficit climbs to $45.2 billion in November WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. trade deficit in November rose to the highest level in nine months as imports of oil and other foreign goods increased, while American exports fell for a second month. The trade deficit jumped 6.8 percent to $45.2 billion, the largest imbalance since February, the Commerce Department reported Friday. Exports edged down 0.2 percent to $122.4 billion, reflecting lower overseas sales of American-made airplanes, autos and farm products. Imports rose 1.1 percent to $231.1 billion, led by a 7.6 percent jump in oil. ___ US factory orders drop 2.4 percent but investment up WASHINGTON (AP) — Orders to U.S. factories fell for the first time in five months in November, but much of the weakness reflected a swing in the volatile category of commercial aircraft. A key category that tracks business investment spending posted an increase. Factory orders dropped 2.4 percent after a 2.8 percent rise in October, the Commerce Department reported Friday. It was the first decline since June but the weakness was led by a 73.8 percent plunge in demand for commercial aircraft following a 94.5 percent surge in October. ___ US approves fix for some Volkswagen diesels DETROIT (AP) — Volkswagen will soon be able to repair some of its diesel cars so they meet U.S. emissions standards. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board said Friday that they have approved a fix for around 67,000 of the 475,000 Volkswagens and Audis with 2-liter diesel engines that were programmed to cheat on U.S. emissions tests. The German automaker acknowledged the cheating in 2015. The remedy will fix 2015 models of the Volkswagen Beetle, Beetle Convertible, Golf, Golf SportWagen, Jetta and Passat as well as the Audi A3. ___ Jamie Oliver to shut 6 UK restaurants in tough Brexit market LONDON (AP) — Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver is shutting six of his 42 Jamie's Italian restaurants in Britain amid tough trading conditions and a lower pound following Britain's vote to leave the European Union. The Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group said Friday that five restaurants in England and one in Scotland would close in the first quarter of 2017. The company has been stung by the slide in the pound, which has increased the cost of buying ingredients from Italy. Despite the pressure on prices triggered by the pound's fall, Britain's economy has outperformed many economists' expectations since the June vote. ___ Wal-Mart names John Furner as Sam's Club next CEO NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart says it named John Furner as CEO of its Sam's Club stores to replace Rosalind Brewer, who is retiring next month. Furner, who is 42, will head the membership-only warehouse chain next month. Furner has been Sam's Club's chief merchandising officer since October 2015. Wal-Mart says he first joined the company as an hourly store associate in 1993. Brewer will leave her position February 1. The 54-year-old has been CEO of Sam's Club for five years and has had a variety of executive roles since joining the company about 11 years ago. ___ SeaWorld: Tilikum, orca that killed trainer, has died ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Tilikum the orca has died after more than two decades at SeaWorld Orlando, where he gained notoriety for killing a trainer in 2010 and was later profiled in a documentary that helped sway popular opinion against keeping killer whales in captivity. Sea World officials said Friday that Tilikum died but didn't give a cause of death. They said Tilikum had faced serious health issues including a persistent and complicated bacterial lung infection. He was estimated to be 36 years old. The 2010 death of the SeaWorld trainer shocked the public, led to a downturn in SeaWorld's attendance and reshaped its future. ___ The Limited to close all brick-and-mortar shops WASHINGTON (AP) — More grim news for malls came Friday as apparel retailer The Limited said it will close all its brick-and-mortar stores at the end of this weekend. The company says it will continue to operate online only after the Jan. 8 closures. A spokesman said the New Albany, Ohio-based chain operated about 250 retail stores in 2016 and that about 4,000 jobs, including seasonal and temporary ones, would be lost. The announcement comes on the heels of Macy's and Sears announcing store closures and job cuts. ___ APNewsBreak: L.L. Bean heiress in trouble over pro-Trump PAC AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — The Federal Election Commission told L.L. Bean heiress Linda Bean that she made excessive contributions to a political action committee she created to support Republican President-elect Donald Trump. According to a Wednesday letter obtained by The Associated Press, federal regulators say Bean's Making America Great Again LLC was limited to individual contributions of $5,000 in a single year— and Bean contributed $60,000. The group spent $66,862 supporting Trump. The FEC letter says the group could face punitive action or an audit if it doesn't respond. ___ Starbucks to stop selling alcohol at more than 400 US stores NEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks will stop selling beer and wine at hundreds of U.S. stores next week as it ends its "evenings" program. The coffee chain says the "Starbucks Evenings" program in 439 company-owned stores in the U.S. will end Jan. 10. It said the program may continue in some of the nine licensed stores where it is offered, or overseas. The program, first tested in 2010, was later expanded as a way to drive sales beyond the morning rush. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average rose 64.51 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 19,963.80. The S&P 500 rose 7.98 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,276.98. The Nasdaq composite jumped 33.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,521.06. U.S. crude oil rose 23 cents to close at $53.99 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, added 21 cents to close at $57.10 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline slipped less than 1 cent to $1.63 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.70 a gallon. Natural gas rose 1 cent to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Updated: January 15, 2017 @ 6:53 pm Full Forecast News Sports Opinion Events Obituaries Buy & Sell AP Business Highlights By The Associated Press Jan 6, 2017 0 ___ US adds 156K jobs; unemployment rate ticks up to 4.7 pct. WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in December, capping a year of slower but solid hiring. Friday's report from the Labor Department portrayed a job market that remains durable 7½ years after the recovery from the Great Recession began. Though the unemployment rate rose to 4.7 percent from a nine-year low of 4.6 percent, it did so for an encouraging reason: More people began looking for work. Because not all of them found jobs immediately, more people were counted as unemployed in December. Hourly pay jumped 2.9 percent from a year earlier, the sharpest increase in more than seven years. ___ Higher wages push stocks to records, but Dow misses 20,000 NEW YORK (AP) — So close! The Dow Jones industrial average missed the 20,000 mark by a fraction of a point Friday as U.S. stock indexes rose after the government said wages jumped in December. Two other major indexes set records. Stocks wavered between gains and losses in the morning after the December jobs report, which showed less hiring than analysts hoped to see. Bond yields rose sharply, as the continued job gains should encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates. Indexes turned higher as investors concluded that the rising wages will lead to more spending on technology and consumer goods. Industrial companies rose as investors hoped for greater economic growth. ___ US trade deficit climbs to $45.2 billion in November WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. trade deficit in November rose to the highest level in nine months as imports of oil and other foreign goods increased, while American exports fell for a second month. The trade deficit jumped 6.8 percent to $45.2 billion, the largest imbalance since February, the Commerce Department reported Friday. Exports edged down 0.2 percent to $122.4 billion, reflecting lower overseas sales of American-made airplanes, autos and farm products. Imports rose 1.1 percent to $231.1 billion, led by a 7.6 percent jump in oil. ___ US factory orders drop 2.4 percent but investment up WASHINGTON (AP) — Orders to U.S. factories fell for the first time in five months in November, but much of the weakness reflected a swing in the volatile category of commercial aircraft. A key category that tracks business investment spending posted an increase. Factory orders dropped 2.4 percent after a 2.8 percent rise in October, the Commerce Department reported Friday. It was the first decline since June but the weakness was led by a 73.8 percent plunge in demand for commercial aircraft following a 94.5 percent surge in October. ___ US approves fix for some Volkswagen diesels DETROIT (AP) — Volkswagen will soon be able to repair some of its diesel cars so they meet U.S. emissions standards. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board said Friday that they have approved a fix for around 67,000 of the 475,000 Volkswagens and Audis with 2-liter diesel engines that were programmed to cheat on U.S. emissions tests. The German automaker acknowledged the cheating in 2015. The remedy will fix 2015 models of the Volkswagen Beetle, Beetle Convertible, Golf, Golf SportWagen, Jetta and Passat as well as the Audi A3. ___ Jamie Oliver to shut 6 UK restaurants in tough Brexit market LONDON (AP) — Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver is shutting six of his 42 Jamie's Italian restaurants in Britain amid tough trading conditions and a lower pound following Britain's vote to leave the European Union. The Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group said Friday that five restaurants in England and one in Scotland would close in the first quarter of 2017. The company has been stung by the slide in the pound, which has increased the cost of buying ingredients from Italy. Despite the pressure on prices triggered by the pound's fall, Britain's economy has outperformed many economists' expectations since the June vote. ___ Wal-Mart names John Furner as Sam's Club next CEO NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart says it named John Furner as CEO of its Sam's Club stores to replace Rosalind Brewer, who is retiring next month. Furner, who is 42, will head the membership-only warehouse chain next month. Furner has been Sam's Club's chief merchandising officer since October 2015. Wal-Mart says he first joined the company as an hourly store associate in 1993. Brewer will leave her position February 1. The 54-year-old has been CEO of Sam's Club for five years and has had a variety of executive roles since joining the company about 11 years ago. ___ SeaWorld: Tilikum, orca that killed trainer, has died ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Tilikum the orca has died after more than two decades at SeaWorld Orlando, where he gained notoriety for killing a trainer in 2010 and was later profiled in a documentary that helped sway popular opinion against keeping killer whales in captivity. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up! I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy. Sea World officials said Friday that Tilikum died but didn't give a cause of death. They said Tilikum had faced serious health issues including a persistent and complicated bacterial lung infection. He was estimated to be 36 years old. The 2010 death of the SeaWorld trainer shocked the public, led to a downturn in SeaWorld's attendance and reshaped its future. ___ The Limited to close all brick-and-mortar shops WASHINGTON (AP) — More grim news for malls came Friday as apparel retailer The Limited said it will close all its brick-and-mortar stores at the end of this weekend. The company says it will continue to operate online only after the Jan. 8 closures. A spokesman said the New Albany, Ohio-based chain operated about 250 retail stores in 2016 and that about 4,000 jobs, including seasonal and temporary ones, would be lost. The announcement comes on the heels of Macy's and Sears announcing store closures and job cuts. ___ APNewsBreak: L.L. Bean heiress in trouble over pro-Trump PAC AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — The Federal Election Commission told L.L. Bean heiress Linda Bean that she made excessive contributions to a political action committee she created to support Republican President-elect Donald Trump. According to a Wednesday letter obtained by The Associated Press, federal regulators say Bean's Making America Great Again LLC was limited to individual contributions of $5,000 in a single year— and Bean contributed $60,000. The group spent $66,862 supporting Trump. The FEC letter says the group could face punitive action or an audit if it doesn't respond. ___ Starbucks to stop selling alcohol at more than 400 US stores NEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks will stop selling beer and wine at hundreds of U.S. stores next week as it ends its "evenings" program. The coffee chain says the "Starbucks Evenings" program in 439 company-owned stores in the U.S. will end Jan. 10. It said the program may continue in some of the nine licensed stores where it is offered, or overseas. The program, first tested in 2010, was later expanded as a way to drive sales beyond the morning rush. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average rose 64.51 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 19,963.80. The S&P 500 rose 7.98 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,276.98. The Nasdaq composite jumped 33.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,521.06. U.S. crude oil rose 23 cents to close at $53.99 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, added 21 cents to close at $57.10 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline slipped less than 1 cent to $1.63 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.70 a gallon. Natural gas rose 1 cent to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet.

The office of Foreign Affairs Minister Stephane Dion said it had no immediate information about Canadian citizens being among the five people reported dead or eight injured after a gunman opened fire. Air Canada and WestJet had said all their passengers and employees at the Fort Lauderdale airport were accounted for and safe. ——— TRADE TRIBUNAL FINDS CANADIAN SOFTWOOD HURT CANADIAN PRODUCERS: The American International Trade Commission says there is a reasonable indication that softwood lumber products from Canada materially injured U.S. producers, setting the stage for the imposition of preliminary duties. The trade commission announced Friday it made a preliminary determination of harm from Canadian lumber that is "allegedly subsidized and sold in the United States at less than fair value." The finding could result in duties that Canadian softwood producers say would result in job losses and plant closures north of the border. ——— WALMART REACHES DEAL WITH VISA: A business group is expressing concern at a truce in a war between Walmart Canada and Visa over merchant fees could result in higher costs for smaller businesses. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business says it suspects Walmart negotiated a reduction in merchant fees, which could effect small merchants. CFIB President Dan Kelly says whenever a large merchant comes up with a special deal, it's at the expense of smaller merchants. The companies have not provided any details of the agreement announced on Thursday. ——— CANADA'S JOBS PICTURE SLIGHTLY IMPROVED: Canada's job market had a promising end to 2016, albeit due to an increase in part-time work. Statistics Canada's year-end employment review Friday said the country added 153,700 net new part-time jobs last year and just 60,400 full-time positions — a number so low it was statistically insignificant. The agency reported gains of 156,000 full-time jobs in 2014 and 147,000 in 2015. ——— POLICE CONFIRM NOVA SCOTIA DEATHS A MURDER SUICIDE: Autopsies confirm the deaths of four members of a Nova Scotia family were a murder-suicide. RCMP Cpl. Jennifer Clarke says the wife, daughter and mother of Afghan veteran Lionel Desmond died of gunshot wounds and Desmond died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Clarke told reporters Friday it's a very tragic and disturbing case. Desmond was diagnosed with P-T-S-D after a tour in Afghanistan in 2007. ——— HEALTH CANADA TO SEND RAPE KITS TO NORTHERN ONTARIO RESERVES: Health Canada is responding to complaints from indigenous leaders that they lack the resources to deal with sexual assault cases. The government is sending rape kits to reserves in Northern Ontario. Rape kits are a vital forensic tool for investigating assaults. Nishnawbe Aski police Chief Terry Armstrong says the shortage of such kits has meant victims have had to be sent to hospitals in outlying areas such as Sioux Lookout and Thunder Bay. ——— REPORT SAYS PUTIN ORDERED EFFORT ON US ELECTION: A new declassified report says Russian President Vladimir Putin "ordered" an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. The report says the Russian government developed a "clear preference for President-elect Donald Trump." It says the goal of Moscow's meddling was to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Hillary Clinton and harm her electability and potential presidency. U.S. intelligence officials released the 25-page public version of the report Friday, after they briefed Trump and top lawmakers on Capitol Hill from a longer, classified version. ——— AMERICAN AMBASSADOR TO OTTAWA RESIGNS: The U.S. ambassador to Canada is stepping down. Bruce Heymen was forced out of his post alongside other political appointees as president-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office. Heymen will step down effective Jan. 20, the day Trump is officially sworn in as president. The New York Times reported this week that Trump's transition team had issued a blanket request that ambassadors appointed by President Barack Obama surrender their posts by inauguration day. ——— TRUDEAU TO FREQUENT A COFFEE SHOP NEAR YOU: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is about to launch a campaign-style tour to try to touch base with ordinary Canadians amid accusations last year of being cozy with wealthy donors at elite Liberal fundraisers. Trudeau plans to talk to people at coffee shops and church basements across the country. The first leg of the tour is to start at the end of next week in southern Ontario with Trudeau travelling from Ottawa to London. ——— PM SPENDS CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS WITH AGA KHAN: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his family were guests of the Aga Khan over the holidays on the wealthy religious leader's private Bahamian island. A spokesman for the prime minister confirmed a published report that the Aga Khan invited the Trudeau family and a few friends to join him on Bell Island. The Aga Khan is the hereditary spiritual leader of the world's approximately 15 million Ismaili Muslims and a renowned philanthropist. Trudeau's office noted that the Aga Khan and Trudeau "have been close family friends for many years." ——— © Copyright Times Colonist Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

(Photo: Elise Amendola, AP) Sears is  closing  150 stores and selling its vaunted Craftsman tool brand, but those steps may not be enough to stop the unraveling of the American icon. With Sears' announcement Thursday coming only a day after rival Macy's said it would close 68 locations, the department store concept itself is looking like an endangered species. In a retail landscape now dominated by online sellers like Amazon and big-box chains like Walmart and Home Depot, Sears finds itself in a search for a reason to exist. "The brand has lost relevance,  it’s lost customers and it’s lost its real reason for existence on the American retail scene,'' says Neil Saunders, CEO of Conlumino, a retail consulting firm. Following "the trajectory they're on, there are no real signs of them turning it around to profitability.'' Related stories: DETROIT FREE PRESS Kmart to close 10 Mich. stores, including original one in Garden City DETROIT FREE PRESS Eastland, Westland Macy's among 68 to be closed USA TODAY Expect more store closings despite big holiday sales Sears has more than 1,300 stores remaining in its portfolio, so its demise could be prolonged. But if the retailer is unable to stem its financial bleeding and is forced into bankruptcy or perhaps a final assets sale, its loss would be akin to that of dominating American companies like airline Pan Am or five-and dime F.W. Woolworth. "I honestly don’t see a spot for Sears long-term," says Van Conway, CEO of Van Conway & Partners, who has advised retail companies and other businesses on reorganization and insolvency. "My mom shopped at Sears. That was the only place she could go. Now you have 50 choices, and Sears is outdated.’’ Founded in 1886, Sears launched its first large, general catalog a decade later and for generations was the go-to source for products ranging from watches to washing machines. Though it lost its place as the nation's biggest retailer to Walmart in the 1990s, Sears enjoyed a renaissance during that decade under the helm of then-CEO Arthur Martinez, who pushed a greater focus on apparel sales and other initiatives. The company faltered in the 2000s, selling its more than $30-billion credit portfolio to Citibank in  2003 and merging the Sears brand with Kmart, another struggling big-box chain. CEO Edward Lampert, a hedge fund manager who shepherded the Sears tie-up with Kmart, initiated his own turnaround strategy, loaning the company cash, spinning off parts of the business and putting Sears' Kenmore, Diehard and Craftsman brands up for sale. Sears' travails are part of a broader struggle that has engulfed many traditional retailers trying to compete in an environment in which consumers can buy virtually any item by browsing online and without setting foot in a store. "One thing people used to use department stores for was wide choice and selection,'' Saunders says. "There's no wider choice than on the Internet, so a lot of the reason for going to those department stores just doesn't exist the way it once did.'' In addition to Sears, many retailers, including Kohl's and JCPenney, have failed to innovate in ways that will continue to woo shoppers. “We're seeing now in retail a lot of legacy players that are dead, dying or in danger of dying because of their inability to do that,'' says Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia Business School,  who is the former CEO of Sears Canada. The flurry of steps taken in recent days by Sears is a stark illustration of the moves it is making to try to survive. In addition to the store closures, Sears announced Wednesday that it had obtained a $500-million loan commitment backed by mortgages on 46 properties belonging to its subsidiaries. That adds to its long-term debt, which had ballooned from $2.2 billion at the end of January 2016 to $3.7 billion at the end of October. "From what I can see, these are very intelligent financial maneuvers to raise money,’’ says Conway. “But the whole issue is, is the core business of the retailer viable?" 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/2jcQc3K

I'd like to admit that point I'm looking at it and I think you're gonna go and it out. You know the crowd and Bob if you had equal players the way it wanted to black but it probably gotten them. Currently. I don't mind that. I just you what you want the best player first of all. It's what don't you want to not going to be equal and I. I'm going to be equal you're gonna find you're gonna find a difference in the two in the two players you're gonna find the difference that you're gonna take the best player or you're going to have. Eight debate with somebody say I think player one is better than player to cannot get to sit there it's like I'm taking a white guy. Thought I mean you know nobody politically yup courses are unique to you how you want your race represented. If you that's that it happens all the time may be in basketball. Because they're you know. Majority of the players are African American. The numbers pretty high in in football. Maybe there is some of that but. I mean when we're talking about. Players right now. You wanna get the best player but it keeps on bringing a bird okay. Bird McHale Ainge ceased being Wal-Mart white guys on that team but even the best team in the history of the game. If those guys weren't good players do you think people even back then and Boston would be cynical I don't care. I just wanna have they done the white guys bird McHale I don't care how bad they are I don't want magic I don't want that you know those guys on. A Korean of those guys on on the lakers. It's all about the best players Burton was the best player that's why they wanted to be here. They don't let let me give meaning they are I know that you are black guys are black woman and and they're you know two actors opt for tech sector herb wrote an op there's one black and one look like I think most black people credit to the black person get the out there don't you. That's then you're due plan race. I'm not I'm up late race I'm glad I'm I'm gonna know wanted to make a decision on who I'm gonna make that okay that you plain rice. OK maybe you think that we're seeing do you think that what. You think that we think that's you know that's on Cuba. That's on you. I'm not here to tell you exactly how I feel I'm not scared of done this for a long time I've never been scared okay. Look at we have to believe me. Now I'm not will be but again he's really kind of talk to different things here one you're talking about retirement city overall. Being racist. You're talking about individuals you know pulling for someone of the same color Bluetooth. That's a yeah they'll do I can't do it. Because you won sixteen of everything so much all over the I'm a I don't do that big out abate LO more before we have sevens in New Hampshire hi Kevin. Good morning again I'm a quick comment about how absurd it is for. People to assume that Curt Schilling the Nazi sympathizer with it because it's not a memorabilia it's a very good friend of mine has an amazing collection of models. Bill spoke to German warm. The chairman had by far the best engineers. And the best. German best war machines of production in the. All they ended up running our our space program if you remember after the war. Exactly. Have a would have made it to the moon we never would have been the first bout with a nuclear bomb. There's so many things had changed history in a positive direction. Because. We cannot forget that you booming and now it doesn't it doesn't loud boom and to collect. Of product that the German people manufactured but what I wrote I like it out people. Can overcome good people and control what people and should never expert yeah. These are great thing which should be collected and preserved. A future generations understand. How good people control. I'd listen it's it's a war war to collection. Apparently there were 200 pieces I'm looking in every relics are there any job is artifacts I don't know I don't know because every story was so fixated on the fact that there were. SS division agent and he or seen anything like that Clooney severed heads it was personal notes every pill boxes or anything like that none and bill boxes. Including Hitler's personal bodyguards or whatever but like three dozen of the 200. Apparently were Nazi stuff the rest was all you know US stuff from whatever Warwick to pull off. I mean forward tube up you rooted. For the thirteen you know like at her and Hillary and aid abroad and like Dolly today Kemp hit a liberal but I can Bobble head doll she would descend until this morning. City College bubble. On the belt 6177797937. Mike Florio will join us on today's a program. A Devin according will join us as well so we'll talk we'll get it seriously gonna get some football will talk football whiner line. At 140 plenty of material there 6177793535. You can caller right now 6177797. When they sent its its excellent seven sevenths and acts that's wrong with you until age thirty yet I think what I've been here forever just to. Akamai and Big Bang I'm out they come out. My big amount I love that may amount amount. There's Eric down the key player. The Eric. Overnight. I think I mean I'll play. And you gadget definitely. And at the did you yank cats which I loved. It's a way do we steal everybody's little thinner ice would they give it all along collaborating we Porsche gave sharing. But a lot of love it out of and you're doc but I'm gonna talk on the boutique Crowder. At the compliment they'll expand respective. I laughed that the situation because that you guys that we'll look at it in saying oh you know it it Kevin Durant. And I look at that that pat history Brett even accept them at the player that he wouldn't use it whereas you know in college. And it is a good relationship with them they had a chance we get them on the scene. To weather phenomena which aired form of course we do need another good player not another distraction which I think that it's become and backpackers and that on. He did you know I eat yet when he. I added don't see. You know that a Christian would say he's generally had any trophy just kind of dumping pollution now. Yeah but part of the connection wasn't what you what you say that that that that the Boston fans knew the connection. Brad Stevens. Anyway. I mean there are some people like it's amazing that this is the Genesis of this. Did I a couple of guys go people and wasn't that how to wasn't Kevin Durant asked. What this crazy you don't just fire hours going often let's let's let's show all that we will him. We will do anything you ask. The same day. I was there and it was and it was like during the game or can we touched the ball he got to know all this applause knows just the opposite matter fact that the win the game. Went on and crowded had to suffer too risky game the fans were all over in a positive way. They love them and nobody was cheering at that point for Gordon Hayward he got like Gordon Hayward in the you know here's Bob and a car next company EI a book. They guys fatal Greg. Now I'm a born to you know armed subject the ball he memorabilia. All we're watching memorabilia. Armed region being noble PE problems. Not cheap. German memorabilia. Com and you talk about Japanese. Memorabilia. That they didn't doubt. I mean you walk already dates all the German memorabilia caution or more on Japanese. I thought it was fan I thought it was banned on EPA didn't they tell us what that ruling. I didn't try to Bellini you you can you can find it. I don't know about this we like these or Nazi memorabilia okay and in perfect condition. On the they shot her condition but that's why I interpret ignition it's kind of street battles on the couch when they thought the car that collect there are problems. You know to get a collector shows are common to talk. So maybe that's why in all our courage alone when you saw our. You don't stick to what he chairman memorabilia and other than any other and the other. Good point he did lose a little bit money and yes so gaga might be some auto racing channel on eBay right now yes it's not a lot of minutes cloying some you know some articles and stand Somali. You know nothing crazy there's no no uniforms no metals I don't think. IDB I was just this just points on the north coins and stamps. And I'm very exciting so nothing from the actual war in other words uniforms Casilla uniforms. And things yet that anybody being hit by a rumor on there I would think so here's said Jim I know Sarasota Florida punch him. Aikman regarding. Cycle inject collide it's Armisen. Rodman and AM also out burden net play off. Other Isiah Thomas the piston Isiah Thomas. He's the young people lead in the back that. Yeah our Larry and have a conference on that at all what do you put that switched. And Larry was the one that made those caught. Larry did have towels or did have chemistry at a press conference because of that if you get together so that people who weren't around or or haven't read about it. I Dennis Rodman came up bird had a terrific game. Believe it was a playoff game against Detroit and Rodman came out and basic in basically said. You know always be if you were if you weren't white you just be another players something like that and then Isiah Thomas doubled down on that said that he's absolutely right or whatever. And it became a big huge issue to the point where the NB yet. Force them to have a press conference. At the at the the you know they playoff site. And in that press conference Larry Bird did just the opposite said that he loved Isiah Thomas. Get his mother got involved at Larry's mom got involved and called Isiah they had a great conversation. Larry let him off the hook. Because Larry did not believe announced that he did not believe it was an issue he didn't have a problem with the saying. It did. Deco still wouldn't say anything at all but I do remember. It did happen there Larry didn't say anything right after so our leader foursome that you don't want to make another automatic line. I sort of used to me and it sports and play each site within every single game. Back in the day and I audit states which they were covering. At the time and you always cordial. And nice it was quote to talk like. If I doubt it like Christian. Fauria like I had a credible. Ludicrous and had a yeah see them trapped in its success is there anyplace Chris is that who you know I would you should focus to turn around walked. Don't bottom line. My view and I otherwise I probably you know you. I write my buddy was gonna say that you had announced he collection you know and actually you know the conventions do a moment ago cool now. The I don't buy that I can tell you this I've seen among public and especially to women he's very nice. Topic wasn't a guy in our move along move. I'm gonna ask you didn't. Here or is she feared her parents know what New Hampshire hello Joseph. Cargo and Dario great show. Meg glad a couple of things and then a question at first that I can't believe it deck I wouldn't talk to Kurt because that would have made a tremendous radio. Yeah I'm looking at great radio he's looking at protecting. His image. And you know you can get away with a that when you play that game when you see you'll yourself off from the public or anybody who wants to dissent. Something you're saying that the problem I have with a it is if you're going to do. And this is where ESPN is going right now they want more opinions stuff more opinion radio. More opinion TV everything is going that way now you gonna seaport TV locally in this market. They're going opinion then you've got to keep a message well and you gotta keep the gates open and you got a lot of people come back edge use so you can't have they debate. If that is we have the same issue Dan dockets the same issue when I first did this for their dockets. A routine of what you were and how does Iowa that was extremely rude but he was at least. Who he there was a Smart thing. C he'd let me on. But he did what you have been doing so much lately is using to build the volume control so whenever I was speaking over him army you know calling amount. He just turned the volume down we've got the boys in Boston community calls we're doing our part we got this got built pol chart here. How do you see aids they are TI ER. Analyzing these is a guy who are different station and capitalizing. The F bomb as he drops in on me in time we've got him rattled too. Our data I don't like employ your radio. It has more emphasis the book those people that they do everything that we do everything in capital that's that's off but when you do. You know after you when you do that that it it has a little bit and do you think it's better when people like at ten exclamation points or does that really drive it home. Capitalize it and like ten exclamation points. So. You all want to know is still on courses on. So my question has all the debate every time something like this comes up ought in the races. Glenn went to that end and and how is there any way you can make its stop now now you quoted as number of athletes. Glenn is right is gonna tell you when I don't go out and how much stock. I Joseph it's a stereo guy you get out is very self I don't know how old you are how long you've lived in the area I Wear it okay do or it is there were issues as you know. Years ago in the in this part and a big part of it was. A very small African American population was one of the smallest the top thirty cities and American Axle weeks it was the only other city. That they could match even now it's what 8% with the rest of the country's thirteen or 14%. That was part of the problem. And it was not a real friendly place. Especially in sports for African Americans and I can recall stuff at Fenway Park it was not a friendly place for them ago. And we're living with that you know bit the the nightmares of the past. I don't think that exist right now I'm not gonna tell you that there isn't a racist among the bunch are fueled home you're gonna get that every city. I don't think Boston is any different now than any major city in America. We've come a long line. Let me with that it the stereotype. It's just clinging on its hanging on and we got lazy people like Beaumont Jones who throws it out there and then won't even discuss it wont to. It's the air is actually the actually reached out to Goodyear's right but he he responded. Right it was like we have the email they rank right up and he said he said he had some personally on a doorknob and I didn't anyways I on like around the horn. The guy got some personal issues right after I dropped them. Howard that you don't want if you don't have national shell. It's easy to dump on Boston it's easy to dump on the wing wing especially when you don't sports. Beacon I can tell you this from doing national shows for company yours. They're two people are very jealous of the success. It is in the sports world in Boston and one so it's fashionable. To do it on a national show just dump on Boston. It's easy and everybody's agreeing with you so you've got 95%. Of the. Like I like that was like. You know Gutierrez and Beaumont it was almost like. It was like the cool thing to do to pick on it affected. Are just whoever be a bully writes obviously something you're gonna see some facility ball and it and if you will would go back to listen to it. And the usual problem would policy you know it's harder or done it's it sounded really exists lazy and that's really what it always comes down to its slate. I don't know I don't know I don't want to dispute dismiss it entirely not only because there are always wise it's not always lazy there are some racist acts appearance over. I don't I don't under understood my ideas it. I guess yes but they're hiding behind. Those and I think it in in the long run. They end up hurting the book cause because what happens as you say it so often. But after while people sit there and sell c'mon you we go again you gonna call Murray's failure. Armories it's like used in the hole it's like easily you know A they tape their practice it's like the whole spy gate situation all over again I'd take a practice. We champions they cheated how did you like that tee when the when people are talking about the patriots you start talking bull run in these guys again. But guys like rob Parker. Fault all these guys who just cannot gather heads. But the reality is and and a bit even compared to the perception we're gonna get the body rob Parker a little bit later on because he. He came on that and all over again people you know he hears they were rob Parker. He was. I'm Max Kellerman before Max Kellerman. The whole cliff thing with Brady so we had Brady here is called optical file odd years ago six years ago that work out I am he's a market at that point he had won a super ball a bit old and one element of Scott and a car hit a Scott. Yeah I mean there are about that. And so ugly and personal and a command eucharist. Obviously racism is a big issue and in an America today and I if you keep religion out trying to fight against the article that the screener. I think that there's a difference between being a racist and playing rates. And you Muzak I'll explain it I may 26 year old like god. Transport with played sports my whole life I think it's different. Speaking of you know likes all the lights and of Austin I think it's different scene in white kid in bashful. Good you know we could play a perennial all he could be also. So I don't think it's racist to cheer him to want a white guy on the scene they're not that they don't want black guys. What they're saying that it's cool you know it's been called a senior white guide to basketball. Because there are so there are so hold on because there's so few of them correct. Well guys I mean there on I think it's fair to say they're on as many as there are. Great black. Us audio recited close. And and now if you look at American white players in the NBA what is that percentage usually do that most of the yeah last year also the white players right off owners. Reacting to I think it's unfair to themselves I don't think like that to generalize and say that is great and not release. Yes I could technically they were playing the race but we're not being racist to want the white garlic seem to be good you know. Yeah but I'd I don't think that was what happened with Jake crown here. Remember this all skimmed off the G-8 Crowder incident and the white chick crowded never brought it up as a race. Something Jakarta was talking about race was. Just so upset I was upset that they are here at a player. I don't know that's the problem I have with the story is that the media people outside this home. Made it erased or Jae Crowder didn't make it to restore and an incident where Jae Crowder a blocked nine playing at a let's he's a look if you're cheering for the white can tell you know it's a balls he do you know all does resemble. There are. Of the Adam. That's out that's how it all started. That's all I've been that there have been mentioning race and racism arm. Playing the race card actually. I hear you are not here I I get. I get the point and I I would say that that they have the better argue. Bringing up the Brian Scalabrine. You know Rudy is coming into the game with your form you have a better shot at doing that the Scalabrine can do some stuff from the court. There were certain he had a skill set certain things that they could use him that there were limited. Walter McCarty was that guy for little but he played a bad team any you know he can't play a little bit and then I love Walter we have some of that. And it just happened to be. Black but I would give it to you that. At least if you going to argue. The Scalabrine issue once they want the fans get all excited when this white kid with the ginger hair when he came into the game and America. You got one of the bags is that like the other kind of like a fifth of Sesame Street episode don't have a better argument there. I mean that's the Rudy thing right. Affected you talked about scalp he's gonna kill me. Though you know you actually you were trying you I didn't I don't really pay attention to go to new orders for it ends at times it didn't seem to get a lot of energy. Did he yeah. I'd and it has yet it it's a skill set about the completion defense etiquette. Get spot up three it wasn't that he was that an awful player he was a guy in certain instances. That really could help you but it didn't start to become the reds' victory cigar outages go to Dave. Motorcade let's go to private number make money Jones case and hey it bought it look up pigs in Brooklyn hello Dave. You know and I I I think our defenses. That's we have a African Americans who actually could rip offs were. A white guy. This say well you know racism that it's our. Optimism balked and then you know at the time that changed. You know it's not over now it's called Europe whether or not it over it but it I mean it really. Gets me. Angry at what what are you quite accurate well. I'm not really in some ought to. Maybe I can edit I didn't say that now he said yeah and is so obviously obviously you're you're taking. Now we don't I. I don't take anything good that's a super human like qualities a hall of fame voters and he said they've like I said here incentive and ability. On this planet and it happens to be this part of the planet. Heard quite a few years so I have seeing the bad evil days I don't know how old you wore. But certainly there were some issues in this town. In which this town deserves some of the reputation that they got because there were some serious racial problems. I RD sat it we had a very small African American population is still do in comparison to all of these of the city's major cities in in America. The one point of bringing up this. That this city has come an awful long way. And so yes I am I'm a little sensitive. Because I've seen the changes the progress that's been made. If you'll let me finish in my election talk ala to talk. Now he sees progress to Portman married. And I've come to the point now where a much in their art. Racist in Boston. I'm not saying and there are still aren't people live look at the color of the skin and may be the same thing exist for black people looking at the color of the skin a white people wanna say is. I don't think we're a much different. Then all of the other major cities in America I don't think you could save that fifty years ago. You may your figure your comments section says Boston is racist so you believe boss and as a CD is racist. I believe that there's a lot in arteries as. You leave America's what do you what do you think about let me let let me speak. That's all I believed that. They're a lot a lot of racism within me. Fought in the area would that meet great about area not a lot that it what what I grew up in what I was part of the opting. Crowd now it's not a bad then putted it is very great as it bosses at cricket and on talk radio. Racism. And corporate America any. Into you can check out not that bad. I didn't say is it any different than any other major city in America. Really I go to war and I I I go to Chicago and they are you there. Downsizing I don't look at almost any scrutiny of travel I disagree if you want it. A secret eyes only you know even accuse us of being white. And so it's very easy for us to say because you were like we don't get that we don't understand it I'm telling you I've seen the odds are all I do get the idea again I. It would went would you get pregnant woman giving birth now so so you really don't understand how I have an American in Boston real. Buehrle thought. Not seen the ups in the deep brown KFC some bad cases in this town and just because I happen to be white doesn't mean that. I don't feel empathy and don't understand the history of what happened in the city. On ansari did that those individual things happened to me no you probably were treated differently. Years ago which is said on the on the streets of Boston and I was a tip all of what I'm saying is usually easier to do my a lot of he she's talked about the idea of I wasn't like it was like humanity and let's make yeah all of saying is that we're living in in the that the stereotypical. Image of Boston that existed many many years ago and that's why the ball money Jones in the so the com is Jake O'Donnell just figure all gonna write because Boston is racist. You're living in didn't end and an old world you living in a world that is much much different. Are there incidents showed their rents and it's put periods and as we read your bottom. Everywhere else did we not just hear about this incident. Race right now that we're they're debating whether it's a hate crime in in Chicago I mean. It's happen I don't think we're that much different now and I think he could make a serious argument years ago that we were different and it wasn't pretty. I search wants have a sub seven on seven under threesome. Yeah me luck around and sees two groups here white collar blue collar but I don't see it that way no one not. Because I am colorblind.

Posted 06 Jan 2017 22:35 Updated 07 Jan 2017 01:15 Rosalind Brewer, president and chief executive of Sam's Club, speaks about leadership at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit in Laguna Niguel, California October 2, 2012. REUTERS/Alex Gallardo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Wal-Mart Stores Inc said Rosalind Brewer, the longest-serving CEO of its warehouse chain Sam's Club, would retire next month, and would be succeeded by company veteran John Furner. Brewer, the first woman and the first African American to run a top Wal-Mart business, will leave on Feb. 1 to take on a "new challenge", according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. Brewer, 54, a champion of diversity within the workplace, came under fire after she alluded that she saw a problem with an all Caucasian male staff at a Sam's Club supplier. The comments, made during a CNN interview in December, was seen by some critics as promoting workplace racism, triggering hashtags "#boycottsamsclub" and "#boycottracistsamsclub". Under Brewer's five-year tenure as CEO, Sam's Club's sales rose 5.6 percent to US$56.2 billion. The unit's same-store sales growth beat analysts' estimates in the past three quarters. Furner, currently the chief merchandising officer at Sam's Club, joined Wal-Mart in 1993. Furner, 42, has served in various capacities, including as the chief merchandising officer of Walmart China. "In John, we see someone who loves the company and our associates, has learned the business from the bottom up and across, and has the desire to lead change which is so necessary in today's environment," Wal-Mart's Chief Executive Doug McMillon said in the memo. Sam's Club, the smallest of Wal-Mart's three business units, operates membership-only warehouse clubs in 48 states in the United States and in Puerto Rico. The business accounted for about 12 percent of the company's fiscal 2016 net sales. The world's biggest retailer's shares were down 1.3 percent in afternoon trading on Friday and was the top percentage loser among Dow stocks.

Police are now asking for help from the community to find the hit and run suspect. Around 8 p.m. on Dec. 17, the woman was hit at the Walmart on 2701 S Interstate 35. Surveillance video from the store captured the suspect speeding off after hitting the pedestrian. Jaymie Clark was picking up last minute Christmas items from Walmart, but all it took was a second, walking out to the parking lot, for her world to change. KXAN spoke with Clark, who is recovering from her injuries. “Half of the kneecap was crushed,” she said, recalling a “flash of white” and hearing someone scream. “My front and back pelvis was broken as well, and bruising along the right side of my rib, bruising on my arm.” Looking down at her injuries served as a reminder for the moment she looked up, asking for more time. “I started praying. Cause we’re believers and I just started going, ‘God, I’m not ready to home yet. And I just was praying, and I have two grandsons that I love and I have family here and I just kept saying please, I’m not ready to go. I love you, I want to be with you, but not now,” Clark said, tearfully. Clark told KXAN with three children and two grandchildren, there’s too much she still wants to be able to see. When asked what she would say to the person who hit her and drove away, if given the opportunity, she said. “That I forgive you. But it’s changed my life and I know it’s changed that person’s life forever.” Clark is grateful to be alive. She’s also still human. “I had a little meltdown this morning from it,” Clark said, tearing up. “I made it across the living room on my walker but it’s just like, it shouldn’t be that hard. Just to do that.” Clark and her family now just want closure. “I wish that their conscience or something would just go okay, I know I need to do the right thing and turn myself in.” A witness told police the car has temporary dealership license plate tags. Anyone with information is asked to call 512-218-6654 or by submitting an anonymous tip to 847411.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

 Walmart acquires ShoeBuy for $70M BI Intelligence Jan. 6, 2017, 11:48 AM 1,826 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Jet.com gets a lift in holiday sales RETAIL FORECAST: U.S. consumers will spend $632 billion online by 2020 E-Commerce & Online Payment Technologies Overview & Trends This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "E-Commerce Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Walmart has acquired e-commerce pureplay ShoeBuy for $70 million in a bid to bolster inventory on Jet.com and help boost overall online sales growth, reports Recode. While the acquisition has the potential to breathe new life in Jet.com's wavering performance, the marketplace's struggles with customer loyalty in the past could minimize ShoeBuy's contribution. Jet.com's sales soared during the holidays, but maintaining this growth will be challenging. Jet.com has had trouble breeding customer loyalty and encouraging shoppers to return for future purchases. As of February 2016, 70% of all sales were from first-time buyers, according to Slice Intelligence, meaning just 30% of purchases were from loyal shoppers. Even with new inventory from ShoeBuy, Walmart could continue to see limited returns from Jet.com if consumers fail to come back for future purchases. Looking ahead, Jet.com will need to focus on engaging consumers and encouraging them to return via initiatives like loyalty programs, or by expanding inventory and product categories. E-commerce has been on the rise in the last several years, thanks in large part to titans in the industry such as Amazon and Alibaba. E-commerce will truly become the future of retail, as nearly all of the growth in the retail sector now takes place in the digital space. BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, forecasts that U.S. consumers will spend $385 billion online in 2016. Moreover, BI Intelligence predicts that number will grow to $632 billion in 2020. This is hardly surprising considering e-commerce's healthy growth. Though the U.S. retail average growth rate in the first half of 2016 was just 2% for total retail, it was 16% for e-commerce. The number of online shoppers has grown by nearly 20 million from 2015 to 2016. And these 224 million shoppers are spending more, as the total amount spent online grew from $61 billion in the first quarter of 2015 to $68 billion in Q1 2016. Finally, these customers are transacting more frequently, as the number of online transactions has risen by 115 million from 2015 to 2016. But all of this shopping online creates its own set of challenges, both for consumers and the companies that are trying to get their products onto shoppers' screens and into their shopping carts. In short, you need a plan. And to create your ultimate e-commerce battle plan, you need the right intel. BI Intelligence is here to help. Our team of industry experts has you covered on topics such as: Shopping cart abandonment Marketing effectiveness Merchandise returns Customer satisfaction Social media monetization Mobile payments Accommodating shoppers at the 11th hour And much more Interested in getting the full bundle of nearly 80 reports?

Trump, who has been silent about the transaction for months, told a friend in the past few weeks that he still considers the merger to be a bad deal, Bloomberg reported. He believed the deal would concentrate too much power in the media industry, Bloomberg said. Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, is also opposed to the deal, Bloomberg reported, citing another person. RETAIL Wal-Mart reaches Visa deal Wal-Mart Stores Inc reached an agreement to continue accepting Visa Inc credit cards in Canada, ending the retailer’s threat to bar the world’s largest payments network from its 409 stores in the country. Customers in Manitoba and Thunder Bay, Ontario, would be able to use their Visa cards from yesterday, Alex Roberton, a spokesman for the retailer, said on Thursday in a statement. Wal-Mart’s Canadian unit threatened in June last year to expel Visa from all of its stores nationwide unless the network agreed to lower the amount it charges for credit-card transactions. CYPRUS Bank says it repaid bailout Bank of Cyprus, the Mediterranean island’s largest lender, on Thursday announced it had paid back in full the 11.4 billion euros (US$12.07 billion) in Emergency Liquidity Assistance it received in an international bailout. The bank said in a statement that it was “another significant milestone in the journey back to strength since 2013.” In March 2013, Cyprus clinched a 10 billion euro loan from the EU and IMF to bail out its troubled economy and oversized banking system. Under the terms of the deal, the government was required to close the island’s second-largest bank, Laiki, and impose a 47.5 percent haircut on deposits above 100,000 euros at Bank of Cyprus. PORTUGAL Lone Star ‘most promising’ Portugal’s central bank said on Wednesday an offer from US private equity firm Lone Star is the most promising bid to buy Novo Banco SA, the so-called good bank salvaged by the Portuguese government from the collapse of major lender Banco Espirito Santo SA. The Bank of Portugal said it has invited the fund, based in Dallas, Texas, to “deepen negotiations” over the possible purchase, though it said rival bidders have expressed a willingness to improve their offers and would not be excluded. The statement gave neither price tag nor date for a final decision. It did not name the other bidders. SERVICES UK sees 17-month high A survey of Britain’s services sector, which accounts for the bulk of the economy, shows it grew at a 17-month high at the end of last year. The purchasing managers’ index, a gauge of business activity, rose for a third month to 56.2 points last month from 55.2 in November. The index, published on Thursday by IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, is on a 100-point scale, with figures above 50 indicating growth. The improvement was due to an increase in new work and comes despite uncertainty over the country’s decision to leave the EU.

Strength trainers wander through the gym, hopelessly searching for the matches to lone dumbbells, while yogis abandon their zen in a race for the last remaining mat. Regulars get flustered after being displaced from “their” treadmills, which are now occupied by people with fitness-related New Year’s resolutions poking at the machines’ foreign buttons in confusion. Gym rats congregate in corners of the gym like a true colony, overlooking their newly overcrowded territory as if it has been unjustly invaded by a rebel group led by Instagram fitness models. Meanwhile, intimidated newcomers to the fitness world quiver with intimidation as a nearby hunk of muscle zealously grunts through a set of sit-ups. This tension turns a space that is peaceful and sacred into yet another that is segregated and stressful. Making a resolution to be more physically active is a decision that should be praised and supported, not ridiculed as a temporary, bandwagon decision that hinders the workouts of gym regulars. The benefits of exercise resemble those of a “miracle cure” or “wonder drug,” according to a 2015 report by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, an institute comprised of 21 medical colleges and faculties in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The report said exercise has a dual functionality, providing prevention and prescription for an infinite assortment of both mental and physical ailments. For college students, such benefits can be essential to counteracting a deskbound life of studying and the unhealthy behaviors associated with it, including poor eating choices, lethargy, binge drinking, drug use and a lack of sleep. Because of the drastic impact that exercise can have on wellness, we should view it the same as classes and extracurriculars: something obligatory that is scheduled inflexibly into our week. Sedentary lifestyle increases all causes of mortality and doubles the risk of developing serious medical conditions, according to the World Health Organization. Physical activity can reduce these risks and reverse these symptoms, thus why it has been praised as a “wonder drug.” But taking responsibility of one’s health by engaging in regular exercise does not stop at the individual level. Preventable, obesity-related illnesses come at an unsettling economic cost to taxpayers and employers. About 68 percent of adults in the United States are considered to be overweight or obese, according to a report by the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases. This adds to already existing costs that account for 21 percent of annual medical government spending, according to a study published by the Journal of Health Economics. If more people take responsibility for their health at younger ages, fewer medical claims may be made and the cost of health care could plateau or even decline as fewer individuals lead sedentary lifestyles. Therefore, an overall increase in activity level would yield a happier, healthier society. The sight of Halas swarming with new faces shouldn’t be irritating. It should be exciting. It’s a sign that people are taking care of their minds and bodies. Talking smack about resolution-makers won’t alleviate the issue of limited gym space; it merely threatens to make exercising a negative experience for some people. So what if a pithy flip of a calendar page inspires people to be more physically active? Motivation can be difficult to come by — it’s even more difficult to maintain — so there should be no shame in jumping on the New Year’s resolution bandwagon. We must use the annual fitness craze as a catalyst for creating and sustaining healthy lifestyles. Those who already have a regular fitness routine ought to welcome newcomers, abstain from complaining about the great gym migration in January and find energy amid the anarchy. With acceptance and encouragement, this year’s New Year’s resolution-ers could be next year’s gym rats.

(CARLOS BARRIA/REUTERS) Wal-Mart unit Sam’s Club chief executive to retire next month Add to ... Siddharth Cavale Reuters Published Friday, Jan. 06, 2017 10:08AM EST Last updated Friday, Jan. 06, 2017 12:27PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Wal-Mart Stores Inc said Rosalind Brewer, the longest-serving CEO of its warehouse chain Sam’s Club, would retire next month, and would be succeeded by company veteran John Furner. Brewer, the first woman and the first African American to run a top Wal-Mart business, will leave on Feb. 1 to take on a “new challenge,” according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. Brewer, 54, a champion of diversity within the workplace, came under fire after she alluded that she saw a problem with an all Caucasian male staff at a Sam’s Club supplier. The comments, made during a CNN interview in December, was seen by some critics as promoting workplace racism, triggering hashtags “#boycottsamsclub” and “#boycottracistsamsclub.” Under Brewer’s five-year tenure as CEO, Sam’s Club’s sales rose 5.6 per cent to $56.2-billion. The unit’s same-store sales growth beat analysts’ estimates in the past three quarters. Furner, currently the chief merchandising officer at Sam’s Club, joined Wal-Mart in 1993. Furner, 42, has served in various capacities, including as the chief merchandising officer of Walmart China. “In John, we see someone who loves the company and our associates, has learned the business from the bottom up and across, and has the desire to lead change which is so necessary in today’s environment,” Wal-Mart’s Chief Executive Doug McMillon said in the memo. Sam’s Club, the smallest of Wal-Mart’s three business units, operates membership-only warehouse clubs in 48 states in the United States and in Puerto Rico. The business accounted for about 12 per cent of the company’s fiscal 2016 net sales. The world’s biggest retailer’s shares were down 1.3 per cent in afternoon trading on Friday and was the top percentage loser among Dow stocks.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

According to Marietta police, 28-year-old Timothy D. Blake man was arrested after several incidents going all the way back to January of 2016. In the first case, reported on January 19, 2016, an anonymous woman reported that someone threw a suspicious ‘mayonnaise’ substance on her back while she was shopping. Police were able to pull surveillance images, but the victim was unwilling to go public or pursue charges. In November of 2016, another woman contacted police directly. A test on the substance sprayed on her determined that it was semen, according to police. On December 28, a Walmart employee reported a similar incident. On December 30 at a local restaurant, an off-duty police officer spotted a company truck that matched a truck linked to the suspect. Blake is accused of masturbating in parking lots, then putting the semen in a syringe. Blake admitted to having a fetish and spraying women with his semen from a syringe he carries with him, according to police. He also said that he used egg yolks and flour or spit in the past. According to WTAP, Blake is facing charges of pandering obscenities, misdemeanor menacing by stalking and misdemeanor sexual imposition. Blake was arraigned in Marietta Municipal Court on Tuesday and bond was set at $11,000. He was ordered to wear a GPS ankle monitor. “It’s not something that we’ve encountered before and after we arrested Mr. Blake, we asked him about it, and he said it was something that he had discovered on the internet and decided to try it,” Washington County Sheriff Larry Mincks told WTAP. Police believe there may have been more victims, given the 10-month span between reported cases. Share this: Tweet Email Print More Share on Tumblr Like this: Like Loading...

Plus, for "Flashback Friday," a look back at a time when fears over mad cow disease hit Canada. If you're looking for a newscast to catch up on the morning's top stories, watch CTV News On the Go. 1. Runners-up: Team Canada finished second at the world junior hockey championships after blowing a two goal lead to the United States.  2. Report coming: President-elect Donald Trump is set to receive a long-awaited report from U.S. intelligence officials about concerns that Russia interfered in the U.S. election this year. The report comes a day after senior intelligence officials said Russia clearly meddled in the election and helped its outcome.  3. Visa ban lifted: Walmart's ban on Visa cards at Canadian locations was suddenly lifted yesterday. Both Walmart and Visa Canada confirmed that shoppers at 16 Manitoba stores and three in Thunder Bay could resume accepting the payment form.  4. Helping vets: Canada's military watchdog says injured soldiers are being forced out of the military before they're ready, and need more support for treating post-traumatic stress disorder. The comments come after a veteran killed his family and himself in Nova Scotia. 5. Flu activity: Doctors and experts say Canada is in the midst of a terrible flu season, with the worst yet to come. New data is expected to be released today, but the last most recent data from the Public Health Agency of Canada recorded an increase in outbreaks and admissions to hospitals in mid-December. And one more thing for "Flashback Friday": On this day in 2004, DNA tests confirm that a Holstein infected with the first case of mad cow disease in the U.S. came from a ranch in Alberta.

Waterford Des Martin @DublinGlobe January 06, 2017 05:25 AM 550SHARES / How much do you know about the quiet revolution currently underway in Co. Waterford?Dublin Globe When people think of the technology that is transforming the world around us, they think Silicon Valley and innovative startups. Few have Tramore, Co. Waterford on their radar. But before we get into the story of nearForm, the Tramore-based company winning huge enterprise customers, let’s look at the changing tech landscape. Enterprise software development is facing some challenges. Large monolith software systems are increasingly difficult to update. Think of online banking apps with poor user experience and well-known eCommerce websites with painful purchase processes. In this environment, a small change can take months to implement. 9-month release cycles, stressful working environments and an IP that stays with the employer complete the not-so-pretty picture. Once upon a time software was only necessary for SaaS companies. Now every company on the Fortune 500 needs to be a tech company with cutting edge software at its core. Hotel Groups, Cruise Liner Companies, Media Conglomerates and more all need to center their entire experience on the customer. Think apps, booking engines, mobile experience, and in-store technology. These days the customer experience needs to be seamless. As customers we expect this and if the enterprise cannot deliver we will find an alternative. That is where the open source revolution comes into play. Passionate people work on open source projects for little or no pay, driven by the knowledge that there is a better way, a brighter future. Three emerging trends have a significant impact on enterprise software: Node.js, Containers, and Micro-Services. In layman terms, this turns monolithic software systems into a necklace with hundreds or thousands of parts. Each part can be swapped out or upgraded in a short space of time allowing rapid development and response to customers needs. 2 nearForm in Tramore. Back to nearForm, a global company with its HQ in Tramore. Founded in 2012 nearForm were the first company outside of Silicon Valley to focus on Node.js consulting for the enterprise. To date, nearForm have done more Node.js deployments for enterprise than anyone else globally. To understand the impact, take Walmart as an example. The software development team there transformed the US retail giant’s mobile e-commerce platform to Node.js, which contributed to two extremely successful and uneventful Black Fridays. The man who ran that team was Eran Hammer, a high-profile member of the global Node.js community. After he left Walmart, he joined nearForm in Tramore as a senior architect. The conventional wisdom is that a company like nearForm needs to be based in Silicon Valley and secure large funding rounds to be successful. Surely that is how you attract the superstars? Bucking this trend nearForm are based in an Irish seaside village with a decentralized team of engineers from across the globe. The nearForm ethos puts developers and their families first and allows staff to retain their IP. This ethos enabled nearForm to attract the superstar names in the world of Node.js and Micro-Services such as Eran to work for the company and in many cases live in Tramore. These engineers are attracted by the opportunity and quality of life on Ireland’s copper coast. Great to see further expansion of #Tramore firm @NearForm with the hire of @eranhammer http://t.co/fOF2BMDnSl via @IrishTimesBiz — Kevin Mitchell (@kevin7mitchell) June 11, 2015 nearForm’s customers include Intel, Ancestry.com, Conde Nast, Fandango and DPD to name a few. This year the company opened up offices in London and New York to keep up with growing demand. This story is about more than nearForm. It’s about changes in the way people work and how corporations treat their employees. People can now work and make a decent living in the town where they grew up. Or escape cities and migrate to the country to bring up a family. The relationship between corporations and their employees is rebalanced in favor of the family. That is huge news for Ireland’s diaspora and people pressurized to move away from their hometown. Keep an eye on towns like Tramore, where the next generation of Ireland’s talent is building world-beating companies. --- Des Martin recently joined nearForm as CMO. Previously he was Head of Growth for EMEA at Qualtrics. Before that he was the founder of the digital agency “The Search Mill” and the analytics startup “3funnel”. Des lectures for the Digital Marketing Institute and organizes the “Dublin Demand Generation” meetup. This story was originally published in Dublin Globe.

Police investigate theft of vehicle A 22-year-old Minersville man was committed to prison after being arrested by Pottsville police after officers were called to 400 Main St. about 12:20 a.m. Dec. 30 for a report of a motor vehicle theft. Responding officers were told that a Pottsville man’s Dodge Neon was just stolen in that area and was driving away along with a dark green mini van that dropped off the suspected thief. Police said state police subsequently found the Neon and the van in the parking lot of the Sheetz store at routes 209 and 901 and a check of the license plate on the van determined that it had been stolen from Newark, New Jersey. Police said that officers then saw Gavin Heim and an unidentified black man flee the parking lot into the woods across Route 901 and crossing the Schuylkill River. Pottsville officers, along with state police from the Schuylkill Haven station, Schuylkill Haven, Saint Clair and Minersville, searched the area and found the two on the railroad tracks where they again entered the river. Heim was taken into custody but the other man was able to flee, police said, adding that the investigation into identifying him is ongoing. The investigation determined that Heim was the driver of the mini van that was reported stolen in New Jersey on Dec. 29 and a criminal complaint was prepared, charging him with felony receiving stolen property, unauthorized use of an automobile and theft. He was arraigned by Magisterial District Judge James K. Reiley, Pottsville, and committed to Schuylkill County Prison unable to post $20,000 bail. Police said that investigators are actively working with other law enforcement agencies concentrating on the vehicle theft in the city as well as several others that are believed to be linked to the actors in this incident and accomplices in the state of New Jersey.

Take the Pledge to stop distracted driving. Courtesy of Fanelli, Evans & Patel, P.C. By Frank Andruscavage / Published: January 6, 2017 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     ANDY MATSKO/STAFF PHOTO A two-vehicle collision occurred Thursday at Route 61 and Terry Rich Boulevard in Saint Clair. Four people were injured. SAINT CLAIR — A child suffered life-threatening injuries, and three other people were hurt Thursday afternoon in a crash at Route 61 and Terry Rich Boulevard, the entrance to the Wal-Mart complex. Saint Clair police Patrolman Joseph Leskin Jr., the investigating officer, said the crash occurred about 12:15 p.m. Leskin said the preliminary investigation indicated that a Nissan minivan was attempting to make a left turn from Route 61 south to enter the Wal-Mart plaza when it was struck on the passenger’s side by a northbound Ford F-150. The impact occurred in the middle of the intersection, and both vehicles sustained extensive damage. Leskin said two people inside the Nissan — a man driving the vehicle and a woman who was a front seat passenger — were both taken to a Pottsville hospital by Schuylkill EMS. A 4-year-old boy inside that vehicle was flown to Lehigh Valley Hospital-Cedar Crest, Allentown, with life-threatening injuries, Leskin said. The driver of the pickup truck, a woman, was also taken to a Pottsville hospital by Schuylkill EMS for treatment. Leskin said the identities of those involved in the crash are not being released pending the ongoing investigation and notification of family members. Assisting at the scene were Port Carbon police, state police from the Frackville station, and Saint Clair firefighters and fire police. Leskin said the investigation is ongoing. Anyone who may have witnessed the crash is asked to call Saint Clair police at 570-429-3050.

Wal-Mart’s Canadian unit threatened in June to expel Visa from all of its stores nationwide unless the network agreed to lower the amount it charges for credit-card transactions. Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, stopped accepting Visa at its three Thunder Bay outlets on July 18, and followed up three months later with a ban at 16 stores in Manitoba. “We have come to an agreement with Wal-Mart through which Visa credit cards will be accepted at all Canadian Wal-Mart stores,” Carla Hindman, a Visa Canada spokeswoman, said in a statement. She declined to elaborate. Walmart Canada, which has said it pays more than C$100 million ($76 million) annually on credit-card transaction fees, called the amount Visa charges “unacceptably high” in a June 11 statement on its website.

(Al Hartmann | The Salt Lake Tribune) The old Granite High School at 3300 S. 500 E. in South Salt Lake remains boarded up Tuesday July 26. A prominent developer's deal to buy the old property has been extended and a new development plan is in the works. Garbett Homes and Wasatch Property's previous plan included 78 homes and a retail center anchored by a neighborhood Wal-Mart grocery store and would have put $10.6 million in Granite School Districtís coffers. Development » Some residents fear big-box presence, want whole parcel planned. Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) South Salt Lake • A planning commission took a big step toward approving lots for 76 single-family homes on the old Granite High property Thursday night. Despite objections from community members who want the entire 27 acres of the former campus to be plotted, the South Salt Lake Planning Commission voted unanimously to give preliminary approval for Garbett Homes to build on the 16 southernmost acres of the property. The company's Jacob Ballstaedt said that after it closes with property owner Granite School District this month, the school district would have six months to tear down the buildings that comprised the school until it closed in 2009. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Some residents and alumni, along with the Utah Arts Alliance, had hoped to preserve some or all of the school buildings. Left up in the air was what will happen to the 11 acres on the north side of the property. Community members are concerned that a big-box commercial store might be built there. "For us, Wal-Mart is not off the table," said Ballstaedt. "We don't decide. Anything other than single-family homes is up to the council. That is one of many options for us in a continuing resolution. The opposition to Wal-Mart is not universal. We need to take time to find a solution. We will move forward with what we have." Commercial development on the remaining 11 acres would require a zoning change, according to Commission Chairman Jeremy Carter, with the input of new residents in the subdivision considered. Merili Carter, who leads an alumni group that wants to save the buildings, said the city was rushing its decision. She presented a petition to save the buildings, which one plan says could be used for an arts complex. Aaron Metcalf, of Centerville, said he worked for a large contractor that does historical renovations and that the buildings could be saved in a cost-effective manner. Commissioner Rachael Lauritzen, who made the motion to approve the residential plat plan, said she saw no grounds to delay the project. Her motion did include a requirement that the city — not a homeowners association — manage a proposed two-thirds-acre open space on 500 East. wharton@sltrib.com Twitter @tribtomwharton   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR NEWS Kirby: Wait'll you see how much the Mormon church pays me How much do top Mormon leaders make?

Saint Clair Police Patrolman Joseph Leskin Jr., the investigating officer, said the crash happened around 12:15 pm. Leskin said the preliminary investigation indicates that a Nissan mini van was attempting to make a left turn from Route 61 south to enter the Walmart plaza when it was struck on the passenger’s side by a northbound Ford F-150 truck. The impact happened in the middle of the intersection and both vehicles sustained extensive damage. Leskin said two people inside the Nissan _ a man driving the vehicle and a woman who was a front seat passenger _ were both taken to a Pottsville hospital by Schuylkill EMS. A 4-year-old boy inside that vehicle was flown to Lehigh Valley Hospital, Cedar Crest, with life threatening injuries, Leskin said. The driver of the pickup truck, a woman, was also taken to a Pottsville hospital by Schuylkill EMS for treatment. Leskin said the identities of those involved in the crash are not being released pending the ongoing investigation and notification of family members. Assisting at the scene were Port Carbon Police, state police from the Frackville station, and Saint Clair firefighters and fire police. Leskin said the investigation is ongoing and asks that anyone who may have witnessed the crash to call Saint Clair Police at 570-429-3050.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Wall Street isn't optimistic about either retailer right now, and that could spell opportunity for long-term investors. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Jan 5, 2017 at 9:07PM Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) each have a nagging growth problem. For Wal-Mart, its customer traffic trends consistently trail rival Costco's (NASDAQ:COST). Lowe's, meanwhile, can't seem to break Home Depot's (NYSE:HD) tight grip on the home improvement market. However, investors shouldn't ignore retailers simply because they are outshined in some areas by rivals. In fact, these out-of-favor stocks tend to be available at attractive valuations that leave plenty of room for market-beating gains. With that in mind, let's look at these two companies as potential buy candidates. Here are a few key statistics to get us started: Metric Wal-Mart Lowe's Market cap $212 billion $62 billion Sales growth 1.4% 3.9% Net profit margin 3% 3.9% Dividend yield 2.9% 2% Return on invested capital 15% 13.6% Price-to-sales ratio 0.45 1 Price-to-earnings ratio 15 26  52-week price performance 13% (5%) Data sources: Company financial filings and S&P Global Market Intelligence. Sales growth and return on invested capital are for the past nine months and exclude fuel sales and exchange rate changes.  Growth slowdown Wal-Mart's biggest achievement over the past few years has been a steady rebound in its customer traffic trends. Shopper transactions ticked higher for the eighth consecutive time last quarter, and while its 0.7% increase trailed Costco's 2.4% jump, Wal-Mart clearly has momentum on its side. Improved average spending per visit and e-commerce sales both contributed to a near-3% revenue boost in its U.S. stores last quarter, which equates to $2 billion of extra revenue. Image source: Getty Images. Lowe's is enjoying faster growth, but only because its industry is in a sharp upswing. Comparable-store sales are up 3.9% through the first three quarters of 2016. Home Depot enjoyed nearly twice that growth pace, which is one reason why Lowe's management isn't happy with its recent performance. "Traffic slowed more than we anticipated in August and September before improving in October," CEO Robert Niblock told investors. Unlike Home Depot and Wal-Mart, Lowe's is getting help from a growing store footprint that pushes sales higher. Yet its latest results suggest it is losing more ground to rivals while Wal-Mart is winning back some share. Profits heading lower Wal-Mart's 3% profit margin makes it significantly more profitable than Costco. However, its earnings power is under considerable pressure that could stick around for years. Over the short term, profits have plunged as the retailer plowed cash into initiatives aimed at improving the customer shopping experience through higher employee wages and better stocked shelves. Rising shopper satisfaction scores and increased customer visits are the key benefits of those moves, but they came at a significant cost. Operating income fell 11% over the last full fiscal year. Lowe's isn't faring any better. In fact, its profitability has slumped as the retailer increasingly turns to price cuts to protect its sales growth. Its 3.9% net margin is less than half of Home Depot's. LOW Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. The better buy Investors can buy Lowe's at about 1 times sales, or well below Home Depot's ratio of 1.8. Similarly, Wal-Mart is available at 0.45 times the past year of revenue, compared to 0.59 times sales for Costco. While both valuations represent significant discounts, I'm more optimistic about a Wal-Mart purchase today. The retailing titan appears to have a good plan in place for protecting market share from traditional rivals and from e-commerce threats. Lowe's, on the other hand, has only seen its market share losses accelerate on challenges from a competitor that seems to have a much better read on its industry. Neither company is likely to wow shareholders with market-thumping operating results anytime soon. But Wal-Mart's sturdier traffic and profitability trends make it the better buy in this match up, in my view. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos owns shares of Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.

Expat in mexico. "Gasolinazo" We live in the Estado de Mexico (Edomex) minutes from the boundary with Mexico City (Lindavista) and for 2 days we have been experiencing fallout from the protests of the 20% increase in gas prices. Yesterday, I went to the CFE office in Lindavista (Mexico City-CDMX) to reconcile an issue with our latest billing. It seems like payments made on Oct 27th did not get all credited to your account. I took a taxi to avoid parking issues but had to wait more than normal as very few Edomex taxis were out. Many of the stores in Lindavista had one or more of their entrances closed and a very heavy police presence was out. Returning home I took a CDMX taxi to the Walmart shopping center but it was completely closed - Walmart-Suburbia-Sams. Absolutely no Edomex taxis at the sitio or on the street so I walked home. This morning an Aurrera store 20 minutes north of us in Ecatepec was looted as the police stood by. Still no Edomex taxis on the street or sitios-only a few Mexico City taxis. The Walmart shopping center remains completely closed as well as most of the shops. Only a very few small shops remain open. Trash pick-up occurred but no mail service. There were a few construction trucks but no gas deliveries in our fraccionamiento today My wife who works as a supervisor for a home nursing service reports that many of her nurses called in as unavailable today. Her travels to clients was better than yesterday but still small issues in Mexico City especially at the open Pemex locations which are very crowded. Overall, it seems that the Estado de Mexico is experiencing more problems than Mexico City. On today's, Televisa Foro news channel the lead off story was about problems with coral reefs in the Yucatan. Harding any mention was made on the 1:30 PM broadcast of the "gasolinazo" protests and looting.   #2 (permalink)   5th January 2017, 10:22 PM Gatos Member   Join Date: Aug 2016 Location: mexico Posts: 560 Rep Power: 3530 135 likes received Originally from usa.

Expat in mexico. I've been hearing from family in Mexico that the violence and looting is being fomented by provocateurs (state agents acting as if they are independent civilians) in order to distract people from the gasolinazo, as well as to create an atmosphere of fear and insecurity so that people are less likely to participate in legitimate, peaceful protests. Check out the graphic in this article which shows an analysis of social media to determine how widespread across the country the calls to peaceful protest have been, vs the centralized nature of the calls to vandalism. (I also learned a new word in Spanish from this article: zafarrancho, meaning havoc or chaos in this context.) Â¿QuiÃ©n infundiÃ³ miedo en redes y WhatsApp y llamÃ³ al saqueo?

In Colima, nothing but legitimate protests, a burning in effigy of EPN, and the liberation of a caseta on the cuota. No saqueos that I'm aware of. The gasolinazo has struck a nerve in Mexico, and the people have figured the government isn't being square with them. Through it, I'd strongly discourage my fellow expats from the urge to get involved in protests unless you're already a Mexican citizen---and maybe not even then. The powers that be would love nothing more than to very publicly toss a few extranjeros under Article 33 as yet another distraction and an appeal to ever-present nationalism.

It looks like the government wanted (wants) to take advantage of protests against the gasoline price rise by converting mere demonstrations and marches into riots and looting. Then they could use the ‘riots and looting’ as justification for coming down with a heavy hand. The provocateur tactics appear to have been, so far as I have seen: • on social media, sharing and resharing photos of people looting to make it seem widespread. Are these photos even from current events? • creating bot twitter users to share these and to recruit provocateurs • seeding marches and demonstrations with provocateurs Isla Verde and ojosazules11 like this.   #6 (permalink)   6th January 2017, 05:42 PM perropedorro Member   Join Date: Mar 2016 Location: El Lay ----> Playas Colimenses Posts: 308 Rep Power: 0 226 likes received 229 likes given Originally from usa.

To summarize, it appears that this particular botnet all originates with one guy. I'm guessing he's something like a sociologist with tech skills, which is pretty scary. So, the question is: Who is he working for? ojosazules11 likes this.   #7 (permalink)   7th January 2017, 02:04 PM ojosazules11 Member   Join Date: Nov 2013 Location: Toronto & Tepoztlan Posts: 922 Rep Power: 127 732 likes received 696 likes given Originally from canada.

I prefer articles from more mainstream media sources, but this one seems well written and based on historical antecedents. https://plumasatomicas.com/2017/01/p...tegia-priista/ __________________ Caminante, no hay camino, se hace camino al andar.   #8 (permalink)   7th January 2017, 03:39 PM citlali Member   Join Date: Mar 2013 Location: Mexico, Jalisco , Chiapas Posts: 2,324 Rep Power: 236 1240 likes received 567 likes given Originally from france. Expat in mexico. We heard quite a bit in Chiapas about the grupos de choque when we had problems.. I am still not convinced that those groups are directed by the government itself, , part of the PRII , I believe but I am not convinced otherwise.. Also people down there immediately blame the grupos de choque for just about every problem, again , I m not convinced..   #9 (permalink)   7th January 2017, 04:17 PM perropedorro Member   Join Date: Mar 2016 Location: El Lay ----> Playas Colimenses Posts: 308 Rep Power: 0 226 likes received 229 likes given Originally from usa. Expat in mexico. In Guadalajara for the weekend and family tells me it's been fairly calm with peaceful marches, a few Pemex stations being blocked and, curiously, some threats of saqueos (WalMart) that didn't materialize, although I can't find much in the news regarding the nature of those threats. Looks like some looting plans were bounced around the nets, and stores reacted by temporarily closing, but not enough people showed up to get the show started. The most positive thing I saw was a few players from Chivas who attended a march on bicycles and encouraged the citizenry to bike-up as a way of telling Pemex to shove it. mr_manny likes this. vBulletin Message   Cancel Changes Quick Reply The following errors occurred with your submission Okay Message: Options Quote message in reply?

According to CBS News, a man named Timothy Blake was arrested for shooting semen at women in a Walmart. Related: Woman Adheres To A Strict Diet Of Sperm Smoothies & Semen Facials Per the report, multiple women revealed they encountered a "creepy" man at a Walmart in Ohio during the months of November and December. All the ladies claimed the perp would follow them around the store like prey while also staring them down. To make matters even more terrifying, two of the women recalled experiencing shock and "panic" upon feeling something sticky hit their bodies when Timothy got close to them. While the poor victims had no idea what the substance was at the time, police have now learned it was Timothy's semen. Though Blake initially tried to lie about the contents, he finally admitted to masturbating into the syringe before shooting victims with his sick concoction. Apparently this was the criminal's way of having "sex" with his victims. Mr. Blake then targeted women he believed "displayed exhibitionist characteristics and wanted to be noticed." Umm… yeah. As of now, Timothy is currently in jail and is waiting to be arraigned. We'll definitely keep you updated as we receive more info on this case.

(AL BEHRMAN/AP) Ryan Ma’s fake dental floss container stickers landed him in hot water with Procter & Gamble thanks to their similarities to Oral-B and Glide branding. (AL BEHRMAN/AP) Trademark protection lands Etsy seller in trouble with Procter & Gamble Add to ... Susan Krashinsky Robertson - MARKETING REPORTER The Globe and Mail Published Thursday, Jan. 05, 2017 5:16PM EST Last updated Thursday, Jan. 05, 2017 5:18PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn PrintLicense article Ryan Ma’s business operation is so small that he has been hand-addressing all the envelopes he bought at Wal-Mart to send his product to customers. But in the age of online commerce, it was still big enough to attract the ire of Procter & Gamble Co. Mr. Ma had been noticing the criticism of Apple Inc.’s new wireless ear buds – called AirPods – which will likely be a growing product in the new year, as Apple’s new phones come without a headphone jack. Among the criticisms were that the small, untethered buds would be easy to lose or steal, with some noting that their case looks like a packet of dental floss. Mr. Ma decided that making them actually look like dental floss might be a theft deterrent. So on Sunday, he designed a sticker to place on the packet to do just that, and put it up for sale on Etsy. The idea quickly received coverage on news websites such as Gizmodo.com. “It kind of blew up from there,” he said. The problem was that he had used real designs as his inspiration, and the sticker looked a lot like P&G’s Oral-B brand of dental floss, called Glide. Mr. Ma’s sticker listed “Oral O” and “Glides” as its brand names, and borrowed the blue-and-white colouring and font style of P&G’s labels. On Wednesday, Mr. Ma received a message from Etsy saying that his listing had been deactivated following a trademark infringement notice from “Procter & Gamble Business Services Canada Company.” “I freaked out a bit,” Mr. Ma said. He revamped the sticker and renamed it “Flossy,” and reposted the listing. (P&G did not reply to a request for comment.) “I didn’t think it would take off, it was just sort of a joke,” Mr. Ma said, explaining that he had only ordered 250 stickers printed . The case raises an interesting question about trademark protection. It does not actually matter that the purpose here was not to use the brand to undercut P&G and sell floss, or that Mr. Ma’s fledgling business is tiny – the fact that the label was clearly based on P&G’s design would be enough to raise concerns. “This happens every day,” said Eric Macramalla, a partner at Gowling WLG in Ottawa who focuses on intellectual property law. “If trademark owners don’t protect their trademarks, then the strength of your trademark gets diluted … and ultimately, they may altogether lose the ability to effectively enforce their rights against other parties. So while big brand owners may be seen as the bad guy when they go after the little guy, it is important that they do so.” Report Typo/Error Follow Susan Krashinsky Robertson on Twitter: @susinsky Also on The Globe and Mail Etsy to launch crowdfunding platform to help artisans finance production (BNN Video)   PG-NProcter & Gamble Co Latest Price$84.01 +0.17 (+0.20%) Updated January 13 4:01 PM EST. Delayed by at least 15 minutes.

Timothy Daniel Blake (Photo: Washington County Sheriff’s Office) Timothy D. Blake, 26, is charged with two counts of pandering obscenity, one count of menacing by stalking and one count of sexual imposition, according to the Washington County Sheriff’s Office. The charges stem from two separate incidents involving the Mineral Wells, West Virginia man. In the first incident on Nov. 2, a woman reported a man lingering behind her at a Wal-Mart in Marietta, according to an affidavit obtained by CBS News. She said the suspect was walking a few inches behind her when she felt something wet on her lower back and foot. The woman said she hurried to a restroom and found a “sticky” substance. On Dec. 28, police responded to a similar report and noticed the same white pickup truck driving out of the parking lot in surveillance footage.  When officers questioned the owner of the truck, Blake, he initially claimed he threw eggs at the women, but later admitted to masturbating into a syringe either in his truck or in the Wal-Mart bathroom, CBS reported. Blake also said he had used syringes to spray eggs, spit or semen on women a dozen times, according to the affidavit. Deputies arrested Blake on Dec. 30 and took him to the Washington County Jail. 39.415352 -81.454844 Filed in: News Topics: Ohio, Walmart Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email KTLA 5 News on Instagram Popular Uber Driver Killed, Passenger Critically Injured in 2 Car Hit-And-Run-Crash in South Los Angeles; Driver Identified Georgia Girl, 12, Live-Streams Suicide on Social Media; Police Say They Can’t Stop Video’s Spread Virginia Man Pays Taxes With 300,000 Pennies to ‘Inconvenience’ DMV Autopsy Results Show New Mexico Girl Was Raped and Strangled on Her 10th Birthday, Had STD at Time of Her Death Latest News Residents in Riverside County Community Outraged After Family Dog Fatally Shot Riverside Police Seek Men Who Allegedly Tried to Kidnap Woman Obama Offers President-Elect Trump Advice During Final ’60 Minutes’ Interview Author, Former State Librarian Kevin Starr Dies at 76 Nation/World Good Samaritan Fatally Shot in Texas Wal-Mart Parking Lot After Trying to Stop Domestic Assault: Police Chief Nation/World Stranger Grabbed, Choked 4-Month-Old in Wal-Mart Checkout Line, Kansas Mother Says Local News Temple City Man Accused of Killing Woman, Stabbing 3 Others Faces 7 Felony Charges Nation/World 5 Malnourished Children Found Living in Car Parked at Florida Wal-Mart; 2 Arrested Local News Lancaster Man Convicted of Raping, Sexually Assaulting Multiple Women Over 5-Year Period: DA’s Office Local News Woman Sentenced to 1 Year in Jail for Impersonating Ex-Boyfriend on Facebook, Sending Herself Threats: OC District Attorney Local News Woman Jailed for Months in ‘Rape Fantasy’ Ads Hoax Was Framed by Ex-Fiance’s Wife: Orange County DA Nation/World Pennsylvania Student Allegedly Put Bleach in Pregnant Girlfriend’s Water Bottle to Harm Unborn Baby Local News Huntington Beach Man Charged With Murder, Arson, Mayhem in Death of 2 Women Local News Long Beach Man Charged With Kidnapping, Sexually Assaulting 2 Teen Girls: DA’s Office Nation/World Arrest Made in Suspected Road-Rage Shooting Death of 3-Year-Old Boy in Arkansas News Washington Man Accused of Decapitating 2 Women, Burning House Down After ‘Hearing Voices’ Local News Man Convicted of Raping Boyle Heights Woman After Breaking Into Her Home Armed With Machete Mobile Apps Android App iPhone & iPad App KTLA 5 News on Social Media Watch CW Shows Facebook Twitter Instagram Email Alerts About & Contact screenertv Screener Untitled-2Covers Online Public File • Terms of Service • Privacy Policy • 5800 Sunset Blvd. Los Angeles, CA, 90028 • Copyright © 2017, KTLA • A Tribune Broadcasting Station • Powered by WordPress.com VIP × Email Alerts Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

Wal-Mart de Mexico, Grupo Comercial Chedraui, Grupo Elektra and Organizacion Soriana stores were among those targeted this week in a wave of anger about the “gasolinazo,” or fuel-price slam. Looting, preemptive store closings and trucks robberies have been widely reported in local press and social media since Tuesday night. Even before the unrest, retailers were expected to take the biggest hit by the hike. The increase is likely to erode purchasing power and consumer sentiment that’s already suffering as a weaker peso fuels concern about inflation. The government is letting gas prices surge as part of a plan to gradually cede control of the fuel market to private development following a landmark energy overhaul in 2013. Antad, the Mexican retailers’ association, said it was a “tough” night for stores and that government efforts haven’t been enough to calm the situation. The association is meeting with Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo to discuss the matter, Manuel Cardona, the group’s head of government relations, said in an interview with Radio Red on Thursday. The economic fallout hasn’t been estimated, he said. Walmex, Soriana, Elektra and Chedraui didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Shares of Walmex, controlled by U.S. retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc., fell as much as 2.1 percent in Mexico City trading. Planigrupo Latam, a real estate investment company, said in a filing that two malls in which it has a controlling stake were looted and vandalized Wednesday and Thursday in Mexico state. The company is working with local and federal authorities to protect the locations and the people who work there, the company said. In a conference Wednesday, President Enrique Pena Nieto said he understood public outrage over the gas-price hike, but that it was a necessary move to reflect higher global prices.

According to CBS News, Timothy Blake was charged December 30 with pandering obscenity, sexual imposition and two counts of menace by stalking.  According to an arrest affidavit, officials in Marietta say they initially received a report in early November from a woman who said she noticed a "creepy" man who "seemed to be lingering around her” while she was shopping at Walmart. The woman claimed a man was walking within a few inches behind her when she felt something wet hit her on her lower back and foot. She “began to panic” and went to a bathroom where she then discovered the substance was “sticky.” She then claimed to notice the man continued to watch her. Police say surveillance video from the store showed the man squirting the woman. A similar report was filed by a different woman in late December. Surveillance video from both incidents showed the suspect driving away in a pickup truck. The pickup truck was then spotted two days later by Marietta Police. When questioned by police, Blake initially told officials he had thrown egg yolks at the women, but an officer told him they tested the fluid. Blake then allegedly admitted it was semen. He then said he had used syringes to spray egg, spit or semen on women on a dozen occasions, according to the affidavit. Blake was booked into jail without bond, pending his arraignment.

Dennis Quan Tran, a 41-year-old man from Westminster, was found by the loading dock of a Wal-Mart located at 3600 West McFadden Avenue on Dec. 18 suffering from multiple stab wounds, according to a Santa Ana Police Department news release. Tran was rushed to a local hospital for emergency surgery, but he died of his injuries. Police obtained surveillance video from the store and used it to determine a person of interest in the case. However, they have been unable to identify the individual thus far, and have requested the public's help, the release stated. A description of the person was not provided. He was seen in the footage walking with the victim about 90 minutes before Tran was discovered with stab wounds. "We have additional video evidence that shows this person of interest walking to the loading dock area with our victim. And then they disappeared," said Santa Ana police Cpl. Anthony Bertagna. The loading dock was the same one where the victim was found. "We think that if we can get this individual identified, then we can find out what their relationship was, and what this individual's involvement in the death of our victim is," Bertagna said. He added that the person was the department's "only lead" in the case at this point. Anyone who recognizes the individual or has information about the fatal stabbing is urged to call Santa Ana homicide detectives by dialing 714-245-8390. Anonymous tips can also be left by calling Orange County Crime Stoppers at 1-855-TIP-OCCS. Santa Ana police released surveillance images of a person of interested wanted in connection to a fatal stabbing outside a Wal-Mart. 33.737337 -117.915233 Related stories Man Found Stabbed to Death Outside of Wal-Mart in Santa Ana: Police Filed in: Local News Topics: Dennis Quan Tran, santa ana, santa ana police department, Wal-Mart Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email KTLA 5 News on Twitter Popular Uber Driver Killed, Passenger Critically Injured in 2 Car Hit-And-Run-Crash in South Los Angeles; Driver Identified Georgia Girl, 12, Live-Streams Suicide on Social Media; Police Say They Can’t Stop Video’s Spread Virginia Man Pays Taxes With 300,000 Pennies to ‘Inconvenience’ DMV Autopsy Results Show New Mexico Girl Was Raped and Strangled on Her 10th Birthday, Had STD at Time of Her Death Latest News Residents in Riverside County Community Outraged After Family Dog Fatally Shot Riverside Police Seek Men Who Allegedly Tried to Kidnap Woman Obama Offers President-Elect Trump Advice During Final ’60 Minutes’ Interview Author, Former State Librarian Kevin Starr Dies at 76 Local News Man Found Stabbed to Death Outside of Wal-Mart in Santa Ana: Police Local News Santa Ana Police Pursue Suspected Stolen Vehicle Local News Santa Ana Police Look For 3 Men in Coffee Shop Armed Robbery Caught on Video Local News 2 Men Arrested in Connection With 1999 Kidnapping and Rape of 11-Year-Old Girl in Santa Ana; Cold Case Cracked by DNA Evidence Local News Authorities Arrest 24-Year-Old Son in Connection With Fatal Stabbing of Mother Inside Saugus Home Local News Man Killed in Santa Ana Hit-and-Run Crash: Police Seek Public’s Help Finding Driver Local News Authorities Seek Help Identifying Man Who Allegedly Robbed Santa Ana Gas Station Store Local News Man Who Attempted to Sexually Assault Woman After Exposing Himself Sought by Santa Ana Police Nation/World Dancing Officer Helps Raise Money for Salvation Army Outside Tennessee Wal-Mart Local News Daughter Arrested in Double Stabbing That Left Santa Fe Springs Man Dead, Girlfriend Wounded Local News Police Have ID’d Suspect Accused of Robbing 73-Year-Old Woman in Santa Ana CVS Parking Lot Local News Alleged Serial Shoplifter Arrested in Santa Ana: Police Local News Man Sets Fire Near Orange County Fire Stations, Burglarizes Them Once Firefighters Leave the Building Mobile Apps Android App iPhone & iPad App KTLA 5 News on Social Media Watch CW Shows Facebook Twitter Instagram Email Alerts About & Contact screenertv Screener Untitled-2Covers Online Public File • Terms of Service • Privacy Policy • 5800 Sunset Blvd. Los Angeles, CA, 90028 • Copyright © 2017, KTLA • A Tribune Broadcasting Station • Powered by WordPress.com VIP × Email Alerts Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

Sports Photos Faces in Places Arts Around The Area People In Society Spotlight on Wicomico Social Lounge Cops And Courts – January 6, 2017 Jan 05,2017 by Shawn Soper Assault Over NYE Food OCEAN CITY — A Belair, Md. woman was arrested on assault charges last weekend after allegedly throwing a beer can at the back of a man’s head during an early New Year’s Day morning argument over late night food. Around 2 a.m. on Sunday, Ocean City Police Department (OCPD) officers responded to a midtown hotel for a reported domestic dispute that had already occurred. One officer met with a male victim in the reported hotel room, while another officer met with the suspect, identified as Jessica Pasko, 31, of Belair, in the hotel lobby. Pasko told police the couple had dated on and off in the past, but that she had broken off their relationship about a year earlier. However, they remained friends and came to Ocean City last weekend for a New Year’s Eve celebration. Pasko told police the pair had been out drinking off and on throughout the day and then returned to their room. According to police reports, the male victim told Pasko he had ordered food because neither of them had eaten all day. However, Pasko told the victim she was tired and would rather go to bed then eat the food he had ordered. Pasko told police that angered the male, who began screaming at her and pushed her to the floor in the hotel room. Pasko told police she got up and attempted to use the hotel phone to call police, but the male, identified as Joseph Garcia, also of Belair, pulled the phone from the wall. Pasko told police she then left the room and went to the hotel lobby to use the phone and Garcia followed. According to police reports, the hotel receptionist told the pair the police were on their way. Garcia returned to the hotel room and was later interviewed by police for his version of the events. Garcia told police it was Pasko that had ordered and paid for the late-night food and that she became angry when he decided to forego the food and just go to bed. According to Garcia, Pasko told him to leave the hotel room if he didn’t want to eat the food she had paid for, but when he gathered his belongings and started heading for the door, he was struck from behind in the back of the head by a full can of alcoholic beverage. According to police reports, Garcia had two deep and bleeding cuts on the back of his head, corroborating his version of the events. Garcia said he returned to the hotel room at Pasko’s request, but had waited on the balcony and held the sliding door shut while waiting for police to arrive. Based on the evidence, OCPD officers determined Pasko was the primary aggressor and she was arrested and charged with second-degree assault. Daughter Swiped Mom’s Credit Card OCEAN PINES — An Ocean Pines woman has been charged with multiple counts of theft after allegedly swiping her mother’s credit card and using it to make purchases including a flat-screen television. According to police reports, a 70-year-old Ocean Pines woman reported her credit cards stolen last Wednesday, Dec. 28. The victim told police her stolen credit cards had been used at the Wal-Mart on Route 50 in Berlin. An Ocean Pines police officer reviewed surveillance video at the Wal-Mart. Store management provided police with pictures of a female wearing a red jacket using the victim’s stolen credit card. The victim was then able to positively identify the suspect as her daughter, Heather Lynn Camp, 43, of Ocean Pines. Camp has been charged with two counts of theft of credit cards and three counts of charging a stolen credit card less than $500. She was taken before a District Court Commissioner and was ordered to be held on a $7,500 bond at the Worcester County Jail. False Armed Robbery Report OCEAN CITY — The Ocean City Police Department (OCPD) and allied law enforcement agencies last weekend searched for hours in vain for a suspect in a reported commercial armed robbery in the resort in what turned out to be a false report. Around 3:30 a.m. last Saturday, Ocean City Police Department (OCPD) received a report of armed robbery at a commercial establishment. The OCPD and allied law enforcement agencies including a Worcester County Sheriff’s Office K-9 unit and the Maryland State Police Trooper 4 helicopter launched a manhunt for the alleged suspect in the reported armed robbery for several hours throughout the downtown area that concluded hours later around 8:30 a.m. However, after further questioning of the “victim” in the case, it turned out to be a false report and no armed robbery ever occurred. The OCPD and its allied agencies devoted several resources and man-hours to the search for the alleged “suspect.” However, no robbery ever occurred and the report turned out to be false. No further information was given about the location of the reported commercial armed robbery nor have any charges been announced for the alleged “victim” who started the false report. Scooter Assault SALISBURY — A Salisbury woman was arrested on first-degree assault and other charges last weekend after allegedly hitting a man over the head with a child’s scooter during a domestic incident. Around 2:15 a.m. last Saturday, a Wicomico County Sheriff’s deputy responded to a residence on Mineola Avenue for a reported domestic altercation. The deputy met with a male victim who reported he had just been assaulted by a female suspect, later identified as Dana Dennard, 28, of Salisbury, with a child’ scooter. During the ensuing investigation, the deputy learned the pair had been involved in a verbal argument that escalated when Dennard allegedly grabbed a child’s scooter and struck the male victim in the head. The deputy observed the male victim was bleeding profusely from a laceration on his head and that one of the scooter’s wheels had broken off and was lying by itself in the driveway. The deputy also observed what appeared to be blood on the scooter’s broken wheel. Based on the evidence and testimony, Dennard was arrested and charged with first- and second-degree assault and reckless endangerment. Wrong Way DUI OCEAN CITY — A New York man was arrested on drunk-driving and other charges last weekend after allegedly being observed speeding in downtown Ocean City and later going the wrong way on a one-way street at the Park-and-Ride in West Ocean City. Around 3:30 a.m. last Sunday, an Ocean City Police Department (OCPD) officer was on stationary patrol in the area of 12th Street when he observed a vehicle heading south on Philadelphia Avenue at a high rate of speed. The officer observed the vehicle moving side to side in its lanes as it continued south and began pursuing it. The OCPD officer followed vehicle across the Route 50 bridge until it went the wrong way on an access point into the Park-and-Ride. The officer stopped the vehicle and made contact with the driver, identified as Exavier Lixence, 30, of New York, N.Y. Lixence did not perform to the officer’s satisfaction on field sobriety tests and was taken into custody on suspicion of driving while impaired and other traffic violations. Two Sentenced In Boardwalk Fight OCEAN CITY — Two more suspects arrested during a fight involving two groups of young people on the crowded south end of the Boardwalk in June pleaded guilty last week to various charges and each received jail time. Around 11:40 p.m. on June 12, Ocean City Police Department (OCPD) officers responded to the area of Worcester Street and the Boardwalk for a reported fight between two groups of individuals. Upon arrival, OCPD officers observed the two groups yelling obscenities and enticing each other to fight. The altercation began to draw a large crowd of at least 100 onlookers on the crowded Boardwalk on a summer Saturday night. OCPD officers attempted to arrest the two primary instigators but both resisted. At that point, several members of the two groups became more uncooperative and several more officers were dispatched to the area to assist. Numerous individuals resisted arrest, which time OCPD officers targeted the combatants with Tasers to gain compliance and disperse the crowd. Among those arrested were Kameron Christopher, 18, of Delmar, who was charged with disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and second-degree assault; Allen D.J. Nelson, 19, of Salisbury, who was charged with resisting arrest and obstructing and hindering; and Luis Pirela-Linares, 20, of Salisbury, who was charged with resisting arrest and obstructing and hindering. Also arrested were Aaron Waples, 19, of Berlin, who was charged with second-degree assault, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct; Jakhai Woodard, 18, of Berlin, who was charged with two counts of second-degree assault, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct; a 16-year-old male from Delmar, who was charged with second-degree assault and disturbing the peace; and a 15-year-old male from Snow Hill, who was charged with disorderly conduct. Last week, Christopher pleaded guilty to second-degree assault and resisting arrest and was sentenced to two years in jail. Also last week, Nelson pleaded guilty to resisting arrest and was sentenced to 30 days in jail. In November, Waples pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and second-degree escape and the sentenced to 60 days for the former and 95 days for the latter. Woodard and Pirela-Linares each have requested jury trials and their cases have been forwarded to Worcester County Circuit Court. Stet Docket For Resisting Arrest OCEAN CITY — A Salisbury woman, charged in November with resisting arrest and other counts after allegedly attempting to prevent Ocean City Police Department (OCPD) officers from taking into custody another individual involved in a fight in a downtown bar, had the charges against her put on the stet, or inactive, docket this week. Around 1 a.m. on Nov. 27, OCPD officers were attempting to arrest a man outside the Cowboy Coast bar and restaurant who had been involved in a fight inside the establishment. While officers were attempting to detain the man, a woman later identified as Elisia Fields, 23, of Salisbury, attempted to pull the suspect away from police while allegedly launching a steady stream of expletives. Fields was told to let go of the man and leave the area multiple times, but continued with her expletive-laced tirade as a crowd of at least 30 people gathered around to watch the scene. According to police reports, even after she had moved away, Fields fought her way back through the crowd and continued to try to prevent officers from arresting the suspect. Ultimately, Fields was arrested and charged with failure to obey a lawful order, resisting arrest and interfering with a lawful arrest. This week in District Court, however, Fields had the charges against her placed on the stet, or inactive, docket. ← Previous Next → 0 shares About The Author: Shawn Soper Shawn Soper has been with The Dispatch since 2000.

Doling out $70 million, Wal-Mart said Thursday (Jan. 5) it acquired Boston-based ShoeBuy, a Zappos-like e-commerce business that offers more than 800 brands and a million-plus items online including footwear, clothing and accessories. ShoeBuy will operate as a standalone and complementary site to Walmart.com and Jet.com and the retailer said it hopes this strategic deal will provide Jet an opportunity to learn from a well-established e-commerce player in the footwear industry. ShoeBuy offers popular brands such as Uggs, North Face, Rockport and Clarks with designer merchandise from Vera Wang, Ralph Lauren and Perry Ellis. Athletic footwear from Reebok, Adidas and Under Armor is also sold on the site. Wal-Mart said the deal with ShoeBuy brings access to a large assortment of products, strong industry relationships and rich content that will further enhance its customer experience. Mike Sorabella and his executive team, along with roughly 200 employees, will continue to be based in Boston and operate as a subsidiary of Jet and Wal-Mart. The retail giant said ShoeBuy suppliers interested in expanding their product reach will have the option to sell on Jet.com as well. The timing of the deal is likely not coincidental. Clothing and accessories sales have quickly gravitated online and Zappos has proven consumers will purchase shoes online and do it often. This is not Jet or Wal-Mart’s first attempt at acquiring expertise. Wal-Mart has long been a purchaser of talent and knowhow, evidenced by its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet in August of last year. Jet itself subscribes to the “buying knowledge” method having acquired home furnishing e-tailer Hayneedle for about $90 million in March of 2016. Wal-Mart’s top executives, CEO Doug McMillon and Walmart.com CEO Marc Lore, have each said the company is willing and able to seek out more of these types of acquisitions in the future. “It’s a fair assumption” that Jet and Walmart will pursue more of these types of acquisitions most likely “in the categories where they are long-tail, high margin products and harder-to-crack brands,” Lore said recently in an interview with Recode. One Wal-Mart watcher said the deal shows that Wal-Mart is interested in diversifying its e-commerce platform. “No sooner did it digest its massive acquisition of Jet.com then along came a category-killer chaser to kick off the new year. The ShoeBuy acquisition may have already been in the works for Jet.com but the fact that it is going through signals that Walmart is taking a portfolio approach to building its digital strength,” said Carol Spieckerman, CEO of Spieckerman Retail. “ShoeBuy brings with it an impressive roster of name brands, not to mention user data, content and footwear-specific platform capabilities. In mass retail, footwear often lags other categories in terms of trend and quality. ShoeBuy rectifies this while giving Walmart a plug-and-play entry into an important category, one that shoppers have grown quite comfortable ordering online.” Keith Anderson, senior strategist for Profitero, told Talk Business & Politics the deal to acquire ShoeBuy provides Jet a slight increase in online market share, but it’s not a huge bump, as Zappos controls a much bigger piece of the pie. He said ShoeBuy has been around a long time (since 1999) and has been through several owners, which likely suggests sluggish growth or lagging profitability. He said estimates are ShoeBuy does a few hundred million in annual sales, which makes the $70 million price tag seem like a decent value. Anderson said the deal does give Wal-Mart might not typically have. He said in the past when Walmart has tried to experiment with more affluent brands in its own stores, the results were disappointing. By allowing ShoeBuy to retain its own site, Wal-Mart will vicariously have access to the higher-end brands and those more affluent shoppers. Looking specifically at ShoeBuy’s site, Anderson it doesn’t look like there is any compelling technology built in. That could change as ShoeBuy will now have access to Jet.com and Walmart.com technology teams. He said Walmart has the opportunity to help ShoeBuy restructure its site and create a compelling experience around shoe shopping online – something it can’t really do on its one-stop shopping site. Anderson said the ShoeBuy deal is also likely about the talent acquisition. He said ShoeBuy has an experienced team of technologists, marketers and merchants savvy about shoe, accessory and apparel sales online. He said as Walmart continues to invest in online abilities acquiring a company could make more sense that posting 100 jobs at a given time. “ShoeBuy already has talent sitting at their desks, in areas that Walmart and Jet hope to glean insights and grow share, in this case the deal makes sense,” Anderson said.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

According to reports, a woman said after she paid for her groceries she drove to the Ingles Gas Station for fuel and realized she did not have her wallet. The woman said she returned to the store and located her shopping cart but could not find her wallet. The woman said the wallet contained her and her three children’s Social Security cards, a L.L. Bean card, a Bank of Madison debit card, health insurance card, Kohl’s card and a Toys R Us card. On December 30 an information report was filed at Wal Mart, Eatonton Road. According to reports, a woman told officers that after she finished shopping she left her purse in the shopping cart in the parking lot. The  woman said she returned but could not find the purse. She told officers she had $900 cash in the purse. An officer reviewed surveillance tape and it showed a woman take the purse and leave the parking lot in a gold Honda. The woman later called authorities and said that she had been contacted by a woman regarding returning her purse. An officer retrieved the purse and delivered it to the complainant who said everything, including the cash, appeared to be in the purse. The woman later called an officer and said she believed $60 was missing from the purse. On December 26 an information report was filed at a Wheat Street residence. According to reports, a man called officer and told them that an unknown vehicle was parked illegally on his property. An officer observed a purple Honda with an orange hood that he recognized as being a stolen vehicle. The vehicle was processed by detectives and towed to an impound lot. On December 29 a fraud complaint was filed at a North Second Street residence. According to reports, a woman alleged that a man who she entrusted to use her debit card for one purchase also used the card to make nine other purchases that she did not authorize. In total the man allegedly took nearly $1,000 from the woman. The woman said she allowed the man to use the card on December 22 and then had “a hard time getting the card back.” The woman said the next morning the man, her vehicle and the card were all gone. An officer was able to obtain video surveillance from Wal Mart showing the man purchasing $72.78 worth of clothing using the woman’s card. The man is described as wearing bright yellow shoes, blue jeans, an open dark coat, a bright yellow shirt and a dark flat bill cap. Eight other charges were made in Covington, reports allege. On December 27 an information report was filed at Steve’s Place, West Washington Street. According to reports, an officer stated that he received a call from a Houston County deputy stating that two stolen ladies gold rings had been sold to Steve’s Place. An officer located the rings at the business and informed the owner. A woman told officers she believed her son had taken the rings and sold them. The woman arrived,  paid fees associated with the stolen rings and took possession of the rings. Morgan County Sheriff’s Office On January 2 Lewis Malik Duffie, 36, Covington was arrested and charged with driving while registration and insurance suspended. He was also detained at the Morgan County Detention Center on hold for Newton County authorities who, reports state, have several outstanding traffic citation warrants for Duffie. Duffie was arrested on Interstate 20 after a deputy responded to aid a motorist out of gas. When the deputy arrived to exit 105 and obtained Duffie’s information, the deputy was notified of the warrants and insurance and registration status. On January 1 an information report was filed at a Fairplay Street, Rutledge residence. According to reports, a deputy responded to a report of a domestic violence incident at the residence “with several guns involved.” Reports state that a couple alleged that a man pulled a pistol on the female complainant because the female complainant did not want another female to leave with the man. The male complainant said he requested several times for the man to put the gun back in his truck but the man refused. The male complainant said that is when he retrieved his pistol from the residence and pointed it at the man. While this was occurring, reports state, a third man was attempting to deescalate the situation and a woman was picking a fight with the female complainant. The male complainant then pointed his pistol at both the man with the pistol and the woman attempting to fight and demanded that they leave the property. Neither would, reports state, so the male complainant then called law enforcement. On December 31 a recovered stolen property report was filed on Interstate 20, near the 107 mile marker. According to reports, a 2004 Chevrolet pickup reported stolen from Putnam County was recovered. Reports state that law enforcement officers reacted to a GPS device alerting them to the vehicle’s location. On December 30 an information report was filed at a Sewell Road residence. According to reports, a man said he received a phone call from another man advising him that his three horses were loose. The complainant said he did not report the incident because the caller repeatedly makes false calls about his horses being out of their stall. Later, when the man’s son arrived home, they observed that the three horses were missing. Three days later the man called law enforcement to report that the three horses had been returned by a Morgan County Sheriff’s Office deputy. On December 29 a use of force report was filed at a Enterprise Road location. According to reports, a deputy stated that he observed an injured male deer lying next to a fence. The deer had compound fractures in both rear legs, reports state. The deputy dispatched the wounded deer with his shotgun. On December 29 an information report was filed at the EconoLodge, Eatonton Road. According to reports, a man alleged that while he was in the hospital, his former girlfriend had moved a camper he was living in off Doster Road to an area that was unaccessible to the complainant. The man said the ex girlfriend did, however, help him move into a room at the Budget Inn. He said after a few weeks at the Budget Inn he ran  out of money and moved to the EconoLodge. The man said the ex girlfriend refuses to return his personal items. A deputy located the ex girlfriend at the Relax Inn, North Main Street. The ex-girlfriend told the deputy that she had, at one time, been in a relationship with the complainant but had ended the relationship because of the complainant’s alleged drug use. The ex-girlfriend also disputed the allegation that she took any of the man’s personal items. She also said that she was now engaged to a new man and wanted no further contact with the complainant. On December 28 an information report was filed at the Morgan County Detention Center. According to reports, a deputy received three black and silver knives that had been placed in an inmate’s sealed property bag from Clarke County authorities. The knives were placed into a new evidence locker until the inmates release. On December 27 an injuring or tearing down mailbox complaint was filed at a Harderman Mill Road residence. According to reports, a woman said someone had shot the family’s mailbox with a shotgun. The woman said her son had found a .12 gauge empty shotgun shell the previous night approximately 10 feet from the mailbox. The woman said she suspects a relative who had confronted the family recently at church regarding the family allegedly “lying on him.” On December 27 Othilia Lopes Lancaster, 40, Stockbridge was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct. According to reports, a deputy was called to a Whispering Lakes Trail residence regarding a custody dispute complaint. When the deputy arrived a woman at the residence told him she was watching a 5-year-old child for her brother. The woman said her brother and Lancaster were in the middle of a divorce and that the court had agreed for each parent to have custody of the child on alternate weeks and that this was the man’s week. Lancaster allegedly arrived and requested to enter the residence to inspect the child but was told by a deputy that the complainant did not want Lancaster on the property. The deputy told Lancaster that he would go inside the residence and check on the welfare of the child. He instructed Lancaster to leave again. This time as she was driving away she stopped, rolled down her window and screamed obscenities at the complainant and delivered a two-handed obscene gesture. She was then arrested. On December 27 a forgery complaint was filed at a Alford Lane residence. According to reports, a man said that on February 13, 2016 he wrote a $125.73 check to Macy’s to pay his credit card bill. The man said the following month he was billed for the original amount plus a late fee by Macy’s. The complainant said he assumed his initial payment had been lost in the mail. However, on December 22 the first check he had written to Macy’s was altered to $625.73 and was cashed in a man’s name who is unknown to the complainant.

Police Handout By Tess Koman Jan 05, 2017 Timothy Blake, 30, was charged with pandering obscenity, sexual imposition and two counts of menace by stalking Dec. 30, CBS News reports. He is accused of following women around in Marietta, Ohio, Walmart and squirting them with his semen through a syringe. Police were first notified of an incident Nov. 2. A woman reported a “creepy” man who, soon after she felt him walking inches behind her, also felt something wet on her lower back and foot. She “began to panic” and rushed to the store’s bathroom, according to an affidavit, where she found the “sticky” substance on her. She also said the suspect was waiting for her outside the bathroom and continued staring at her when she emerged. Surveillance footage from the store showed the suspect squirting the woman with an unidentifiable substance. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below According to the Smoking Gun, authorities received a similar second report more than a month later from a woman shopping at the same Walmart who “had some substance thrown or sprayed on her.” More surveillance footage showed the same man squirting a syringe at the victim. After Blake was identified and taken into custody, he told police he’d been throwing egg yolks at the women who’d reported him. When police informed him they'd tested the substance and confirmed it was semen, Blake admitted he’d masturbated into the syringes in his car or in the Walmart bathroom, the New York Daily News reports. He also admitted to squirting women on “approximately a dozen occasions,” though he maintained he’d used egg yolks and spit most of those times. Blake also said he attacked the first reported victim because “she displayed exhibitionist characteristics and wanted to be noticed,” according to the affidavit. He also told police he thought “maybe it was his way of having sex with these women." A court filing shows Blake said he had a farm and hence had the syringes because he inoculates his animals. CBS reports Blake is married but said his wife had no knowledge of his alleged crimes. He is currently in jail without bond pending arraignment. Follow Tess on Twitter.

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) Print Email Karin Price Mueller | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By Karin Price Mueller | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 05, 2017 at 9:06 AM, updated January 05, 2017 at 9:52 AM comments "Wish lists" have become an essential shopping tool for many families. Let's say you're part of a large brood and everyone -- from Aunt Edna to Cousin Jerry to Grandma -- wants to know what to buy you or your kids for the holidays or for birthdays. You could tell everyone different items and hope they're within your family members' budgets. You can also cross your fingers that they choose the right product in the desired color or size. Or, you can create a wish list with your favorite retailer. It's simple. You go to the retailer's website, log in and create your list. Then you basically go shopping, plopping the items you long for on the list. When your relatives are ready to shop, they can visit the site, search for your wish list and select the items they want to purchase. It's seen as a win-win: you get what you want and you take the guesswork out of buying for your loved ones. But if you're not careful, wish lists can lead to identity theft. It's way easier than you might expect to get private information about people from their wish lists. As an example, we decided to see what we could learn about a Bamboozled relative who is married with two kids. We started at Amazon. (In case you missed it, read our recent warnings about fraudulent third-party sellers who sell their fake wares on Amazon.) We clicked over to the wish list page and entered the relative's name. Her list came up, as did her birthday -- an important factoid for those who might want to steal her identity. We clicked around her list, and we learned the names of her two children. That's because she added notes to the items her kids wanted, specifying which kid each item was for. Next, we tried Target to see if she had a list there. She didn't, but both of her kids did. Those were easy to find because we learned the kids' names on the Amazon site. Their lists told us the town and state in which they live. Not the full address, but the town and state are another nice chunk of information for fraudsters. Over at WalMart.com, wish lists showed us their town and the state, and the birthdays of the kids. So in less than 10 minutes, we had the names of mom and the kids, birth dates for all three and the family's town and state. This relative made a big mistake. All three retailers -- Amazon, Target and Walmart -- offer privacy settings for wish lists. But shame on the retailers -- the default setting is to make the list public. A 9-step plan for data breach victims So how could scammers use this information? Pretty easily. There are lots of public databases where the scammer can take someone's name and hometown and learn more. Exact addresses from property tax records. Email addresses from Facebook, LinkedIn and other social media sites -- if the user is loose with privacy settings. And you'd be surprised what a Google search can yield. Next, with readily available technology, the scammer could create a fake login page for any retailer, borrowing screen shots of the actual retailer login pages. Then the scammer could include code that would record whatever is typed into the login pages -- a user name and password. Once the fake web page is up and running, the scammer could send the user an email impersonating the retailer. It might say, "Here's a coupon code for an item on your wish list," or "We have a question about an item on your wish list" or "Somebody has made a purchase from your wish list." Anything to make the user want to get an update or visit the site. And the email would include a link. When the user visits the fake site and enters her login and password, the scammer now has access to the person's account. When the scammer visits the real account, they can get even more information about you: your full billing and shipping address (and the addresses of anyone you've sent a gift), your phone number, and the last four digits and expiration dates of as many credit cards as you've added to your account. They can also change your password. Does it matter if someone can break into your Amazon or Target or Walmart account? It matters plenty. They can make purchases and have the items sent to their own address, but that's not the worst of it. You see, despite warnings, most people use the same passwords and logins for most of their accounts. All the scammers have to do now is guess. Guess which banks or financial institutions you use -- and they have clues because they had access to your payment information on your retail accounts. Or they can simply use the info they have to open new credit cards or loans in your name. Or in your kids' names. Bamboozled: 2016 Hall of Shame So what should you do? For starters, if you use wish lists, don't allow them to be public. Again, public is the default for the lists we've examined, so be sure to actively click what you must to make the lists private. You can always send your relatives a link to your list, and some retailers allow you to invite people to your list via email. Next, don't use the same login and password for all of your online accounts. Just don't. Also, think twice about storing credit card information on any retailer's website. Hacks happen. Data mishaps happen. Don't let it happen to you. Finally, don't click on retailer emails unless you're absolutely positive the email is coming from the real business. If you want to use a coupon code from an email, copy it down rather than follow the link -- just in case the link takes you to a phony imposter site. Type the address for the real site and type in the coupon code at checkout. And don't forget you can check your credit reports for free once a year through AnnualCreditReport.com. Stay smart, Jersey.

ICONS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP This Young Dad Created a Viral App That's Taking on the $710 Billion Nightlife Market Dan Fennessy founded Party With a Local to bring people together for better nightlife experiences whether you're in Amsterdam, Rio de Janeiro, or New York City. By Maisie Devine Maisie Devine is an investor at ZX Ventures, the global incubator and venture capital arm of AB InBev. Prior to ZXV, she co-founded a recruitment app for busy, professional women. She was named to the Forbes 30 Under 30, Tech.co Top 20 Startup Founders Under 30, and 26 Women to Watch in Tech by AlleyWatch. Devine also worked in digital media advertising at Interactive One and handled the 30 largest clients, including P&G, Walmart, Comcast, and J&J. @Maisie_Devine Investor at ZX Ventures@Maisie_Devine WRITE A COMMENT Dan Fennessy, founder of Party With a Local. Dan Fennessy, founder of Party with a Local. CREDIT: Company Advertisement Dan Fennessy has had a crazy last couple of years: from growing up in tiny coastal Australian town, to working odd jobs, to persisting after the two co-founders left his nascent start-up, to having a baby. To now: he is a darling of the Silicon Valley world and boasts a hot nightlife app, Party With a Local, that already has more than 100K users and is helping globe-trotting millennials have better nightlife experiences. Now together with his international and diverse team (from 5 continents, speaking 11 different languages) they aim to become THE app that connects people for nightlife, anywhere in the world. The team is passionate about fun nightlife experiences and also about meeting new people, so in many respects, they are solving their own problem. The Party With a Local team love seeing successful meetups, great nights out, and genuine friendships being formed via the app. The ability to bring people together for awesome experiences is what truly excites and energizes the team everyday. From humble beginnings and many challenges faced along the way, the team and the app are now doing exceptionally well. They are now one of 10 teams participating in Techstars Connection, in partnership with AB InBev, in New York. Techstars is widely considered one of the best startup accelerator programs in the world, and less than 1% of applicants are accepted. Now, Party With a Local is focused on the US market specifically to create partnerships with some of the world's biggest brands and to build a vibrant community of nightlife enthusiasts - one party at a time. Their relentless drive to succeed, their openness, their diversity, great team culture and sense of humor are the ingredients that hold Party With a Local together and give them an edge over the competition. Recently, Inc sat down with Fennessy to discuss Party With a Local over coffee and this is what he had to say: Why did you start Party With a Local? Party With a Local came from my own experiences of traveling, and living abroad, and finding that a night out anywhere is better with a local, but it's not always easy to meet locals. I did a 1 year 'round the world trip 10 years ago when I first experienced this problem. I was traveling from city to city in Asia, Europe, North America and Central America and wanting to go out, meet new people and sample the local nightlife. More often than not I would have no idea where to go out, and end up at crappy or expensive tourist bars, only meet other travelers (especially other Australians) and generally have a bad night out. I'd gone traveling to experience new things and meet new people from all over the world, but it just wasn't happening. In some rare cases I would randomly meet a local and have a totally different experience --meet amazing people, get the local perspective and  go to bars, clubs and events that I would never have found on my own. But these experiences were few and far between. This is where the idea came from -- I just wanted to solve my own problem and have more of these great experiences. Party With a Local has since expanded beyond just being a travel or new in town app, based on user behavior, to be about connecting anyone anywhere for nightlife. Not having people to enjoy nightlife with is a problem that a lot of people around the world face. How exactly does the app work? Whether it's to grab a drink, meet new people at festivals, or get nightlife tips, you can find like-minded friends through the app (no, not for dating). You can post a 'party status', join and share events, and just chat with people who are nearby and up for meeting up and going out to enjoy nightlife. Party with a Local App CREDIT: Company How is this different from a dating app? It's very different. Party With a Local is all about community, and we make sure to encourage the right kind of culture within our app. We state clearly pre, during and post sign-up that Party With a Local is not a dating or hookup up, which people seem respond well too. You can review people who you've met via the app - which brings a level of trust to the people you are meeting (and something dating apps will never do, for obvious reasons). Also, people are more and more meeting up in groups, which is why we'll soon be launching our events feature - for more group interactions and meetups. We hear from many of our users, who say they really like Party With a Local, specifically because it's not about dating; its purpose is to meet new people for good times and nights out. We think the world is ready for a meet new people app that is not about dating or hooking-up. What better place to start than nightlife? What are some of the best stories you've heard from people using Party With a Local? We hear lots of stories of genuine connections being made and amazing experiences being had via our app. My favorite is Florian and Michael's story. The short version: Florian, from Stuttgart, met Amsterdam local Michael through the app. They became good friends, had lots of great nights out in Amsterdam. Florian went traveling in SE Asia and Michael decided spontaneously to fly to Bangkok to join him. They then used the app to organize a rooftop party with a bunch of people in the State Tower of Bangkok (where Hangover 2 was filmed). What is the bigger vision for Party With a Local? The core of our app is about connecting people. We aim to own the nightlife niche first, and it's a very big niche. Beyond that, we might move into other verticals, like eating out, shopping, other local experiences, but right now we're fully focused on nightlife. If we can keep playing a part in bringing people from different backgrounds and beliefs together around the world, that would be a huge win for us. Go out and meet someone new, someone different from you, grab a drink, discuss your differences, find middle ground - after all, connections trump hate! What are some of the biggest challenges you've faced? I found out I was going to be a dad, right around the time I'd decided to go all-in on Party With a Local. Then it was still a self-funded startup that wasn't looking likely to make any money for the coming period. Whilst I was happy and excited for what was to come with a baby, I couldn't get my head around how around how I would be able to combine a startup (an app connecting people for nightlife!), with my new responsibilities of being a father, and of supporting a family financially. I agonized for weeks: Should I quit my startup and 'get a real job' to support my family? Most startups fail anyway, right? If I quit now, most people would understand, and in fact they'd think it was the responsible thing to do. But the thought of quitting felt terrible to me. Like a lot of founders, my startup felt like my baby too, one that was nowhere near grown-up and hadn't reached it's potential yet, and the thought of letting it go now filled me with dread. My girlfriend knew how much Party With a Local meant to me and was extremely supportive during this time. She told me to go for it, that we'd figure it out financially even if the app didn't work out. So while I was at times filled with doubt and anxiety, there was no doubt in her mind I needed to keep going and would succeed. Amazing support! I also spoke to a good friend at the time who said 'what does quitting now tell your future child about chasing your dreams? That you give up as soon as there's a challenge?' And: 'imagine in the future you have to tell your kid that because of him/her you had to give up on your dreams!' ...Right. I kept going, more determined than ever to make it work. Becoming a father made me more focused and a better entrepreneur.

Timothy Blake, 28, was charged with pandering obscenity, sexual imposition and two counts of menace by stalking after two female customers complained of a man following them around the Marietta, Ohio, superstore and squirting them with a “sticky” substance, according to CBS News. Surveillance footage from the two incidents showed the suspect getting into a pickup truck belonging to the oilfield company where Blake worked. Two days after the second incident, police spotted the truck while Blake was on his way to dinner with his wife. Originally, Blake claimed the white substance in question was egg yolks mixed with flour — a concoction he said he learned to make on the internet. But he later admitted it was his own semen after an officer told him they had run tests on the substance. Blake admitted to masturbating in his vehicle and in the Wal-Mart bathroom to obtain the semen samples, as well as committing the heinous act around a dozen times over two months. According to the criminal complaint, he used semen on four of those occasions and either the egg mixture or spit on the others. He also confessed to aiming specifically for his victims’ buttocks, saying it was his way of having sex with the women, according to the police report. When pressed on why he committed his crimes, Blake brought up a history of sexual abuse, claiming to have been molested by his parents. He also said he got the idea from reading about it online. “It’s not something that we’ve ever encountered before,” Washington County Sheriff Larry Mincks told WTAP. “After we arrested Mr. Blake, we asked him about it, and he said that it was something he had discovered on the internet and decided to try it.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under ohio ,  perverts ,  sex offenders Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Apple removes New York Times from Chinese app store Read Next Apple removes New York Times from Chinese app store Most Popular This Week 1 Hell gets ready to welcome Charles Manson 2 Buzzfeed's Trump report takes 'fake news' to a new level 3 Giants blamed for trashing airplane after playoff blowout 4 Obese woman is now a stunning model thanks to 'teaspoon diet' 5 It's 'digital heroin': How screens turn kids into psychotic junkies 6 12-year-old girl live streams her suicide in front yard Share Selection Trending Now in News 41,239 It's time to face facts: Obama's presidency was a failure 26,784 Like clockwork, Trump rips 'Saturday Night Live' on Twitter 23,918 Bob Woodward calls Trump dossier 'garbage' Now On More women rip Michael Che’s dating app etiquette Katie Couric’s ready for her TV comeback Eric Schneiderman and Preet Bharara power lunch SEE ALL Now On How To Watch The NFL Playoff Games Online For Free SEE ALL Most Popular This Week Hell gets ready to welcome Charles Manson Buzzfeed's Trump report takes 'fake news' to a new level Giants blamed for trashing airplane after playoff blowout Obese woman is now a stunning model thanks to 'teaspoon...

Follow @triplepundit 46.6k Triple Pundit: People, Planet, Profit Menu Special Series Progress to 2020: Tackling resource use from all angles In this series we’ll take a fresh look at resources and how they are used. We’ll go beyond natural resources like air and water to look at how efficiency in raw materials can boost the bottom line and help the environment. We’ll also examine the circular economy and design for reuse — with an eye toward honoring those resources we do have. Sponsored by Sealed Air Sustainability at Home and Beyond While changes at home can’t solve the many environmental crises we face today, they can sure help. Through this series, we’ll explore how initiatives like curbside compost pick-up, rebates on compost bins, and efficient appliances can help families reduce their impact without breaking the bank. Sponsored by Whirlpool Corporation Social Impacts in Apparel Despite decades -- centuries even -- of global efforts, slavery can still be found not just on the high seas, but around the world and throughout various supply chains. Through this series on forced labor, sponsored by C&A Foundation, we’ll explore many different types of bonded and forced labor and highlight industries where this practice is alive and well today. Sponsored by C&A Foundation Black Lives Matter and Beyond In this series we examine how companies should respond to national controversy like police violence and the BLM movement to best support employees and how can companies work to improve equality by increasing diversity in their ranks directly.

Smart/clean tech is on the cusp of disruptively reshaping our buildings, vehicles and businesses. This mega trend is the business opportunity of the 21st century. I actually predicted this in a 2008 Entrepreneur.com article that projected a $1 trillion annual global green economy by 2017. I called this projection a Green Economic Revolution. The social media reaction at the time ranged from a few calling me a visionary and more than a few calling me a green idiot. Today, the Green Economic Revolution annually generates trillions of dollars in annual sales and investments. Over a dozen ‘Green Giant‘ businesses like Costco and Target sell at least $1 billion annually in more sustainable goods and services. Companies from Apple to Walmart are saving billions of dollars annually using sustainability best practices like zero-waste manufacturing and green supply chains. Global investment in renewable energy is growing at a rate projected to reach $1 trillion annually. And financial data increasingly documents that sustainably-managed companies deliver higher returns. The coolest response from my 2008 article were the emails from a then-emerging group of green entrepreneurs. Inspired by how they were making money and a difference, I took on the goal of telling their stories. To do so, I created a website called Earth 2017 to host articles profiling their best practices. Two years later, I started a YouTube channel called Earth 2017 TV. I use this site to host video interviews with CEOs, business owners, and community leaders that are pioneering how to grow jobs and win customers by going green. Today, these two sites have hundreds of articles and videos. They are a gold mine of proven green best practices for saving money, growing sales and making a difference. Both of these sites are available without charge, ads or requests for your email address. Green does build business In early 2011, I moved from observer to practitioner. The U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce assigned me the task of designing and implementing a coaching program for business owners. Walmart committed the funding for this coaching program that the Chamber called Green Builds Business (GBB). Through GBB, I worked with hundreds of business owners covering every imaginable industry across 11 cities. The coaching provided business and community attendees with: A survey lecture on proven green best practices Assistance in designing a green project that could make money in 90 days One-on-one coaching My favorite GBB coaching project was with a Hispanic father and son who owned a Salt Lake City auto body shop. They tried for years to win a government or corporate contract. And they chose to become a green auto body shop in the hopes of finally sealing a deal. Building a green auto body shop was a huge investment challenge for this small business, so we focused on low-hanging fruit. The father and son agreed to invest in higher-efficiency lighting and water-saving technologies to save money and reduce the business’ environmental footprint. We also developed a plan for investing in lower-emissions paint technologies. At that time, these combined actions gave their business competitive advantage. Within 90 days of starting their GBB project, this father and son won a competitive bid with their local police department. Shortly afterward, they won a contract with a national rental car agency. Being greener than their competitors had opened the door to their sales success. Today, this company is truly a green auto body shop — thanks to its continued investment in green technologies and best practices funded by its sales successes. I could not be prouder of them, the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Walmart and our country! To me, this is how America is supposed to work together for business success and a greater good. Earth 2017 I did not envision Election 2016 10 years ago. My enthusiasm for the future blinded me to the backlash created by disruptive change. But here’s the insight every business person must recognize about the Green Economic Revolution: Its growth was never based on politics. The Green Economic Revolution is driven by green products winning on price. It is anchored on smart/clean technologies gaining manufacturing economies of scale to drive down prices. One example is that we enter 2017 with utility-scale solar and wind being lower in price than coal or natural gas power plants. The Green Economic Revolution is also a customer revolution led by urban millennials. Urban millennials are driving innovations in lifestyles and work practices around diversity, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, connectivity, mobility, renewable energy and health. Their innovations will grow our economy. Their adoption of smart/clean tech will restore our environment and improve human health. Look no further than smartphones, companies like Patagonia or Toms with strong corporate responsibility programs, and the renewal of downtowns across America to see the influence urban millennials are having on our economy. This influence will surely continue in 2017 and beyond. And if the past is any indication, it will continue to drive low-carbon technologies into the mainstream. This article is the first in a series on Earth in 2017. I hope you find them engaging and thought provoking. Most importantly, I hope they provide you with at least one best practice that you can implement during 2017 for making money and a difference.

Courtesy of NAI Sawyer Courtesy of NAI Sawyer The former Wal-Mart store on Pass Road in Biloxi has been empty since the Wal-Mart Supercenter on C.T. Switzer Blvd. opened in 2012. The Pass Road building now has a new owner, which plans to create several retail spaces and bring in stores that don’t currently operate in South Mississippi. Mary Perez meperez@sunherald.com 1 of 2 i By Mary Perez meperez@sunherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Biloxi After sitting empty for nearly four years, the former Wal-Mart store at 2381 Pass Road in Biloxi has a new owner. The 127,000-square-foot building on Pass Road at Popp’s Ferry Road was sold for an undisclosed price to an out-of-state investor. Wal-Mart did not own the building. Brian Bolis of NAI Sawyer represented the seller and Michael Sawyer of NAI Sawyer represented the buyer. The building, which sits on 9.7 acres, will be converted into several smaller retail spaces. The owners expect to fill it with retail stores that may be new to South Mississippi. That area of Pass Road has seen new restaurants open in the last four years, since a new Wal-Mart Supercenter was built on CT Switzer Road. Retail has lagged since Stein Mart followed Wal-Mart’s move nearer to Edgewater Mall. When complete, the shopping complex is expected to create 100 to 200 new jobs.

Latest News Man wanted to fry, eat lover's penis after hacking it off Minnesota man drowns in Puerto Rico trying to save stepson Jury to weigh whether to spare life of carjacking killer Share POSTMEDIA NETWORK Jan 4, 2017 , Last Updated: 2:26 PM ET A low-rent lothario who believed some female Walmart shoppers wanted to be noticed allegedly shot his semen at them through a syringe. According to cops, Timothy Blake, 28, of West Virginia confessed to following the shoppers then squirting the semen at them. Investigators believe the semen shooter struck at least a dozen times over a two-month period. Blake allegedly told cops he believed one victim was displaying“exhibitionist characteristics and wanted to be noticed.” The criminal complaint says detectives asked Blake whether the sperm spraying was like a sexual encounter and he told them that “maybe it was his way of having sex with these women and that was what he thought of when committing these acts.” According to the Smoking Gun, Blake told detectives that he would masturbate in his vehicle then ejaculate into a syringe. Other times he would repeat the act in the Walmart bathroom before striking the “unwitting women”. In November, a Walmart shopper told cops that a “creepy” man was shadowing her in the makeup aisle. And when the man passed, she “felt something wet on her foot and lower back.” The substance was “sticky.” Then,on Dec. 28 another woman said a substance had been thrown or sprayed on her buttocks in Marietta, Oh. On store surveillance video, cops realized it was the same man. Blake is charged with a couple of counts of felony obscenity.

For the second quarter, our consolidated gross margin increased 160 basis points to 13.9% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to this innovation strategy. We are on the way to achieving our full fiscal year 2017 net income growth guidance of 50% to 70%,” commented Molly Hemmeter, Landec’s President and CEO. “Net income in the second quarter, consistent with our prior guidance, decreased to $0.05 per share compared to $0.07 per share during the second quarter of last year primarily due to the Company recording a non-recurring $1.2 million write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs from the refinancing of its debt during the quarter. We are estimating that the refinancing will result in approximately $400,000 in lower interest expenses over the next twelve months (see Questions & Answers #8 for more details). Net income also decreased as a result of no change in the fair market value of our Windset investment compared to a $200,000 increase during the second quarter of last year. Revenues for the second quarter decreased 3% compared to the second quarter of last year, primarily due to a strategic decision to reduce low margin business in our packaged fresh vegetables business beginning in the second half of fiscal 2016. These efforts to shift away from non-strategic low margin business and to innovate and grow higher margin products as a larger percent of our business are resulting in continued improvement in both gross and operating margins and has us trending toward our stated net income goal for fiscal 2017,” stated Hemmeter.  Summary of Second Quarter 2017 Results Compared to Second Quarter of 2016 Revenues decreased 3% to $135.9 million Gross profit increased 10% to $19.0 million Gross profit margin increased 160 basis points to 13.9%   Operating income increased 16% to $3.3 million Net income decreased 29% to $1.3 million or $0.05 per share Continued Hemmeter, “Lifecore is off to a very strong start, with revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2017 increasing 27% and operating income increasing 46% to $4.7 million compared to the first six months of last year due primarily to a very favorable product mix change to a higher percentage of revenues being derived from higher margin fermentation sales. At Apio for the first six months, gross profit was up $3.4 million, or 13%, based on a favorable shift in product mix and positive operating efficiencies even though revenues were down 5% due to our prior strategic decision to focus on our higher margin business in the packaged fresh vegetables business, which resulted in lost business beginning in the second half of last fiscal year. Apio is focused on reducing operational costs through investments in productivity projects in all of its facilities and currently is realizing efficiency gains in its salad business as a result of the newly constructed, fully-automated Hanover facility.”  “Lifecore’s business,” added Hemmeter, “has expanded beyond its historical capabilities as a premium supplier of hyaluronic acid (HA) to become a fully integrated contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO), providing differentiated fermentation, formulation and aseptic fill services for specialized medical materials. This transition is reflected in Lifecore’s revenue and operating income growth, both of which are expected to exceed our original expectations for Lifecore for fiscal 2017.”   “In our Apio packaged fresh vegetables business, we have been successful in significantly shifting our product mix to higher margin Eat Smart® vegetable salad products which now account for 36% of the packaged fresh vegetables business revenues and contributed to the packaged fresh vegetables business second quarter gross margin increase of 290 basis points to 12.2% and first six months increase of 260 basis points to 13.6%,” said Hemmeter. “Salad kit revenues were slightly down during the first half of fiscal 2017 compared to the first half of last year and lower than our expectations due to two primary factors. First, Costco moved to a multi-sourcing strategy from a sole sourcing strategy for their salad kit business due to industry-wide produce shortages during last year’s El Nino. Second, in the Canadian market, where Eat Smart salads have a 44% market share, there was a dramatic decline in the retail salad kit market growth rate due to the effects of a competitor’s salad product recall in January 2016. According to Nielsen, for the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2015 of last year, the retail salad kit category in Canada grew 44% whereas for the 26 weeks ended this November 26, 2016 the retail salad kit category in Canada grew only 6% (see Questions & Answers #3 for more details).  In our guidance we had expected a 30% growth in the Canadian retail salad kit category,” added Hemmeter. “Even though overall salad kit revenues were down in the first six months of fiscal 2017, our salad kit business continues to outperform versus the U.S. salad kit category. For the six months ended November 26, 2016, the Nielsen U.S. salad kit category growth rate, excluding Costco, in consumer dollars was 17% while the comparable growth for Eat Smart salads during the same period was 42%, primarily driven by increased distribution of Eat Smart salads at Sam’s Club and Walmart. We continue to see high growth potential in our salad products as new salad products are added to existing accounts and as we add distribution in key U.S. accounts,” concluded Hemmeter.                                                                                                                      Fiscal Second Quarter 2017 Results Revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased 3% to $135.9 million from $140.4 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a 9% decrease in revenues in Apio’s packaged fresh vegetables business partially offset by a 16% increase in revenues at Lifecore and a 16% increase in Apio’s export business. Net income in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $1.3 million or $0.05 per share compared to $1.9 million or $0.07 per share in the year-ago quarter. Net income was negatively impacted by a $1.2 million write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs from the refinancing of Landec’s debt during the quarter and from a $1.2 million, or 9%, increase in operating expenses in the second quarter primarily at Apio resulting from additional headcount hired during the past year in the areas of sales and financial analysis. In addition, there was no change in the fair market value of our Windset investment during the quarter compared to a $200,000 increase during the second quarter of last year. These decreases to net income were partially offset by: (1) a $2.0 million, or 20%, increase in gross profit in Apio’s packaged fresh vegetables business due to a favorable product mix shift to a higher percentage of revenues derived from salad kit sales and from favorable operational cost variances, specifically lower produce sourcing costs and improved labor efficiencies in the Company’s processing plants and (2) a $376,000 decrease in income taxes. Fiscal Six Months 2017 Results Revenues in the first six months of fiscal 2017 decreased 3% to $268.3 million from $275.8 million in the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to an 8% decrease in revenues in Apio’s packaged fresh vegetables business partially offset by a 27% increase in revenues at Lifecore and a 10% increase in Apio’s export business. Net income in the first six months of fiscal 2017 was $4.6 million, or $0.17 per share, compared to $4.8 million, or $0.18 per share, in the first six months of fiscal 2016. The decrease in net income was due to: (1) a $2.9 million increase in operating expenses, primarily from headcount added during the last twelve months, (2) a $1.2 million write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs from the refinancing of debt during the second quarter, (3) a $290,000 decrease in operating income at Corporate due to the completion of a 15-month license agreement during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, and (4) no increase in the fair market value of the Company’s Windset investment during the first six months of fiscal 2017 compared to a $1.0 million increase in the first six months of last year. The decreases in net income during the first six months of fiscal 2017 were partially offset by: (1) a $2.0 million, or 24%, increase in gross profit at Lifecore from increased revenues, and (2) a $3.2 million, or 14%, increase in gross profit in Apio’s packaged fresh vegetables business due to a favorable product mix and favorable produce sourcing costs during the first six months of fiscal 2017 and due to operational productivity improvement initiatives which combined resulted in the Apio packaged fresh vegetables business gross margin increasing 260 basis points to 13.6% compared to 11.0% during the first six months of last year. Management Comments and Guidance for Fiscal 2017 Ms. Hemmeter stated, “For fiscal 2017, we are reiterating our guidance for consolidated net income to increase 50% to 70% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, resulting in an estimated EPS range of $0.53 to $0.60. This is based on favorable produce sourcing continuing and on our continued shift to higher margin products. We are still not projecting a significant change in our Windset investment in fiscal 2017, although we do expect an increase in both the third and fourth quarters, which is included in our guidance. We now expect revenues for fiscal 2017 to be flat to slightly up compared to fiscal 2016. We expect consolidated cash flow from operations of $30 million to $35 million and capital expenditures of approximately $30 million. For the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect revenues to be in the range of $133 million to $140 million and net income to be $0.16 to $0.19 per share.”    Conference Call The live webcast can be accessed directly at www.landec.com/earningscall or on Landec’s website on the Investor Events & Presentations page.

Lifecore’s growth during the first six months of this year compared to the same period last year was driven by a substantial increase in revenues in its higher margin fermentation business as a result of increased demand from existing customers and from a 15% increase in aseptic sales primarily due to recent development products becoming commercialized.  These increases were partially offset by lower business development revenues as a result of a key customer obtaining FDA approval of its drug product, moving that program from development to commercial production. 2) Why were Apio’s packaged fresh vegetables revenues down 8% for the first six months? As a reminder, we lost approximately $30 million of packaged bag business during the last six months of fiscal 2016 as a result of (1) our strategic decision to discontinue select low margin business, (2) some customers deciding to shift from single sourcing to a multi-source strategy, and (3) prorating some customer orders during the produce shortages last fiscal year. A large majority of the business we lost was low margin business that carried a very high cost to service. Because this business was included in the first half of last year, over 80% of the decrease in revenues in Apio’s packaged fresh vegetables business during the first six months of this year is attributable to this lost business. In addition, salad revenues were down 4% during the first six months of this year compared to the same period last year primarily due to the loss of some salad kit business at Costco due to a corporate-wide decision by Costco to move to a multi-supplier sourcing strategy following industry-wide produce shortages in 2016. This reduction in salad kit revenues at Costco was partially offset by significant growth in salad kit revenues in U.S. retail and some growth in Canadian retail. Other factors affecting salad revenues included the delay in customer commitments for new salad kit products following the extensive industry-wide produce shortage last year until sourcing returned to normal and the launch of a market test of plant-based protein salads throughout all Costco U.S. stores during the first half of last year that was discontinued later in fiscal 2016. Importantly, while packaged fresh vegetables revenues declined 8% in the first six months, that business generated a 14% increase in gross profit and a 260 basis point improvement in gross margin to 13.6%.    As consistent supply has resumed, customers are now reviewing our new products and we expect to launch new Eat Smart salad products during the second half of fiscal 2017 and first half of fiscal 2018. Although the shift to multi-sourcing salad kits by several customers has negatively affected Apio in the near term, there may be opportunities in the future for additional business as a result of this strategy.   (3) In the Canadian retail market, why was the salad kit growth in the 26 weeks ended November 2016 so much lower than the growth for the 52 weeks ended May 2016? The severe drop in growth appears to be directly related to a major recall of salad products by a competitor last January that has affected the entire product category. The recall of salads that had been distributed in the Eastern provinces was broadly publicized in Canada. According to Nielsen data, for the 10 months ended January 2016 prior to the salads recall, the retail salad kit market category in Canada had grown at 36%, in significant contrast to the growth of that category in the 10 months from February through November 2016 following the salads recall when the retail salad kit category grew at only 5%.  Any product recall in the category can affect all players in the category.  There have not been any reported incidents since the one last January and we expect that salad kit growth in Canada will start to increase again as consumers re-gain confidence in the category. (4) What is the expected revenue growth for salads for all of fiscal 2017? We now expect revenues from our salad products to be flat to slightly down this year compared to last year due to Costco’s multi-sourcing strategy and Canadian growth decline. However, on a positive front, our U.S growth for salad kits, excluding Costco, during the first six months of fiscal 2017 was 42% compared to category growth of 17%. We continue to see salads as a major growth platform at Apio as we innovate new items, add new products to existing accounts and expand our distribution to key U.S. accounts. Sam’s Club continues to expand our salad products within their stores. In May of 2016, we began shipping our Sweet Kale Salad to approximately 400 Walmart stores.  Due to its high performance, Walmart quickly expanded our salad to approximately 1,400 stores in October.  The next opportunity to expand further in Walmart will be in April 2017. Selling Eat Smart products to the highly competitive U.S. retail market has required Apio to evolve its sales capabilities. In May of 2016, we hired a new Chief Customer and Sales Officer at Apio to lead a re-structuring of the sales organization and the implementation of new systems and controls. Our new data analytics platform is a key tool that will arm the sales organization with the data required to drive a compelling brand story that includes shopper insights, merchandising, promotional and pricing information to grow a profitable business for both Apio and our customers. 5) In the previous earnings release call, you mentioned that you were transitioning to a new market database.  Is that transition complete and what are the updated Apio market share and All Commodity Volume (“ACV”) numbers? To further differentiate Apio, we have invested in upgrading our market data analytics platform and insight analysis.  Since our previous earnings call, Apio has completed the transition from Nielsen Perishables Freshfacts data to the Nielsen Answers data and added Nielsen Homescan Panel, which provides consumer scan data and shopper insights for all stores, including Costco. The switch to the new database provides many advantages. First, we now receive data from nearly double the number of retail stores (over 35,000 versus 18,000).  Second, we have store-specific product, pricing and promotional data that is available by geography and banner.  Finally, Homescan data provides consumer insights and Costco-specific data that we did not have previously.  This new platform will provide improved data and shopper insights that will drive more informed product development, pricing and promotional decisions. With the new data platform, Apio’s North American market share statistics showed very little change from the old platform (less than 100 basis points).  For 52 weeks ended October 29, 2016, the size of the North American market in which Apio participates (vegetable bags, vegetable trays and salad kits) is approximately $3.2 billion in consumer retail dollars including retail and club stores.  Of this market, Apio’s overall share is approximately 17% while Apio’s Eat Smart salad kits have a market share of approximately 13%.  In Canadian retail, Eat Smart salad kits enjoy a 44% share while in U.S. retail, Eat Smart salads have a share of approximately 3%, presenting a large growth opportunity for Eat Smart salad kits in the U.S. retail market. Apio’s North American ACV statistics differed to a slightly larger extent from the old platform (between 100 and 1000 basis points depending on the product segment or geography), primarily due to the large increase in the number of retail stores being included in the new database. ACV is also not tracked for some categories.  For the 52 week ended October 29, 2016, in U.S. retail Eat Smart salad kit ACV was approximately 17% while total Eat Smart branded packaged fresh vegetables ACV was approximately 34%.  In Canadian retail, ACV for Eat Smart salad kits was 84%. Our goal is to continue to grow the Eat Smart market share and ACV of salad kits in the U.S., specifically with major U.S. customers.  We intend to share our new analytics and insights with those strategic customers who choose Apio as their innovation partner to drive growth and profitability for both partners. 6) How is produce sourcing looking thus far in fiscal 2017? Produce sourcing for the first seven months of fiscal 2017 has been within expectations, with an adequate supply of virtually all of our high volume crops. During our third fiscal quarter we enter the winter season when we source most of our California crops from southern California and Mexico. This is also the time of year when we get virtually all of our green beans from Florida. The winter season has historically been the time of year when we have suffered our most significant produce shortages, which occurred last year. Overall, for the first seven months of fiscal 2017 our produce sourcing costs are on plan and so far winter sourcing is consistent with our expectations. 7) What is the status of Windset’s expansion plans and the permitting issues? Windset is nearing completion of a new ten-acre facility on land Windset owns in the City of Santa Maria using a new type of greenhouse structure that Windset intends to use to grow strawberries on a small commercial scale. They have also started construction on a new 30-acre glass greenhouse, which is also on land they own in the City of Santa Maria, where they currently intend to grow peppers and/or cucumbers.  Windset expects that it will begin commercially harvesting strawberries this month and peppers this spring. Windset is also looking at constructing an even larger strawberry structure on land it owns in the City of Santa Maria but it is in the early planning stages and any construction of this new facility will not begin until later this calendar year. Windset is still working with the County of Santa Barbara on permitting for land it is leasing in the County for the construction of greenhouses using its new type of greenhouse structures but does not expect approval for at least 9-12 months. 8) Why did the Company refinance its debt during the quarter? The Company refinanced its debt to lower its interest expense and increase its financial flexibility in support of Landec’s five-year growth plan. Landec plans to use these funds to capitalize on the significant tailwinds in the healthy living segments in which it participates by expanding its existing operations and fueling its internal innovation initiatives. Our new syndicated credit facility of $150 million with JPMorgan Chase, BMO Harris Bank and City National Bank, a subsidiary of Royal Bank of Canada, consists of a $50 million term loan that refinanced existing debt and a $100 million revolving credit facility. The $50 million term loan has a five-year term with a ten-year amortization and no prepayment penalties. Our interest expense, excluding the $1.2 million write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs from the refinancing, over the next 12 months is projected to decrease by approximately $400,000 compared to the interest expense the Company would have incurred on the previous loans that were refinanced. The interest rate is based on Landec’s leverage ratio and can range from LIBOR plus 1.25% to 2.25%. On November 1, 2016, the Company fixed its LIBOR rate for the next five years at 1.22%. The current spread is 1.75% and therefore the current interest rate on our term loan is 2.97%. 9) What are Landec’s top priorities for the next 12 to 24 months? Our continuing priorities are: (a) Shifting our product mix to higher margin products at both Apio and Lifecore while advancing the CDMO strategy at Lifecore. (b) Increasing demand for both our packaged vegetable products and our biomaterials products to fill the additional capacity added in fiscal 2016. (c) Developing innovative new salad products to broaden and strengthen our offerings. (d) Expanding our retail presence in the U.S. through gaining new customers and increasing distribution with existing customers. (e) Increasing return on invested capital by maximizing returns on each capital allocation decision. (f) Focusing on evaluating the natural food product segment to identify areas where Landec can enter through new product development and/or strategic acquisitions or investments. (g) Executing on our Lifecore programs with existing customers and securing new partnerships utilizing our CDMO strategy. (h) Supporting Windset in its expansion plans to build new hydroponic controlled atmosphere structures using new growing methods for new crops. 10) How do the results by line of business for the three and six months ended November 27, 2016 compare with the same period last year?

A founder of the group and owner of the Run-DMC brand, Darryl "DMC" McDaniels, was listed as the plaintiff in the lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in the Southern District of New York. Run DMC pose at the Grammy Awards in 1988. From left, Joseph Simmons, Darryl McDaniels, and the late Jason Mizell. MARK LENNIHAN / AP, file The complaint said the defendants are "advertising, selling, manufacturing, promoting and distributing multiple products" in the group's trademarked name. The products include glasses, hats, T-shirts, patches, wallets and other items. The lawsuit alleged that the retailers have improperly profited, diluted and harmed the Run-DMC brand, which it said has generated more than $100 million in revenue since its inception in the 1980s. It called the Run-DMC brand "extremely valuable," and said it is the subject of several licensing agreements, including to endorse Adidas sneakers from Adidas The lawsuit alleges defendants are confusing consumers into believing that Run-DMC endorsed their products and are trading on the goodwill associated with the name, in violation of federal trademark and New York unfair competition laws. Run-DMC was founded in New York in 1981 by McDaniels, Joseph "Run" Simmons, Darryl "DMC" and Jason "Jam Master Jay" Mizell, who was fatally shot in his Queens recording studio in 2002. McDaniels and Simmons later announced that the group had officially disbanded. The group's hits include "King of Rock, "It's Tricky," and "Can You Rock It Like This." In 2009, Run-DMC was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, becoming only the second rap act to be awarded that honor. Amazon and Wal-Mart, which also owns Jet, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

News Weather Historic Triangle preps for winter's first significant snowfall JCC Snow prep Salt and sand are on the roads and sidewalks and people are ready with soup, sleds and shovels. Salt and sand are on the roads and sidewalks and people are ready with soup, sleds and shovels. Wesley WrightContact Reporterwwright@vagazette.com The first significant snow of this winter season is barreling down on the Historic Triangle, making it a good weekend to stay home.  The National Weather Service predicts 6-8 inches of snow will fall on the Historic Triangle beginning late Friday and lasting through most of Saturday. The snow is expected to hamper travel throughout coastal Virginia all weekend. And temperatures will remain in the 20s and 30s through Sunday, leaving little chance for the snow to melt before the workweek returns Monday. Wind gusts are expected to intensify up to 35 mph on the backside of the storm, said Scott Schumann, of the National Weather Service's Wakefield office. "It's a storm that's going to intensify as it comes up the coast ... ," he said. "That wind will start to howl on the backside of this storm." Heavier snowfall totals are expected to fall farther south into Hampton Roads and the North Carolina border as a front pushes northward, according to the National Weather Service. A winter storm threatened the Virginia Peninsula with another round of snow January 2017. View photos from this storm and others in this gallery of snow and winter weather photos from 2017 and years past. (Daily Press) A blizzard warning is in effect for Hampton, Poquoson, Norfolk and Virginia Beach until 10 p.m. Saturday because the combination of snow and wind could create near-whiteout conditions, according to the weather service. The Richmond metro area is expected to see closer to 4-6 inches, according to the weather service. "This isn't an unusual system," Schumann said. "It's not a classic superstorm, but it will dump a good amount of snow on the area." Treacherous travel State and local public works crews will maintain roads throughout the weekend. Photos of snow from the recent winter storm. (Virginia Gazette) Williamsburg Public Works employees plan to work 12-hour shifts this weekend to plow every city street, city spokeswoman Lee Ann Hartmann said. "We plow every inch of those nine square miles within the city," she said. During the storm's height, city crews may need to focus on clearing primary and secondary streets and hold off on lesser-traveled residential streets, she said. VDOT is responsible for plowing public roads within James City and York counties. The state started pre-treating roadways in the Hampton Roads region — which includes the Peninsula and Southside cities — to help prevent icing, according to a news release. VDOT has close to 550 pieces of equipment in our region that are ready to respond to the storm. "If people aren't sure about who to contact if their roads aren't plowed, I can certainly be an advocate for them," James City County administrator Bryan Hill said. "If they call me (253-6602) or email me (bryan.hill@jamescitycountyva.gov), I'll know who to call or how to contact them to make sure any issues are addressed." Hill said he will try to deploy personnel on Sunday to clear parking lots and sidewalks around county facilities and schools so those buildings can open Monday. "If I can get out there Sunday, then we're clearing empty parking lots, instead of having to go around cars," said Hill, who urged residents to stay home and off the roads both during the storm and afterward while crews are working. Residents unsure about whether state or city plows will come down their road can simply look to their tax bill for guidance: people who pay taxes to the city receive city services, regardless of whether they have a Williamsburg mailing address. A private contractor may be in charge of clearing private roads and entrances for people who live in private communities and apartment complexes. "We're stocked up and ready to go," Hartmann said. For residents who consider the cold and snow a dangerous situation, help might be a bus ride away. Free warming shelters are set up throughout James City County and Williamsburg. Snow can complicate use of the warming shelters, which is something Kathleen Hale, James City County coordinator of emergency management will remain wary of as winter wears on. "One thing that could affect that is how heavy the snow is coming down, and how quickly (workers) can get out to it," Hale said. "Usually they're up early and it's not an issue. Otherwise, the county will make (a point) to get information out." An important take-away from officials: Call ahead to your destination before you leave home. Stores, offices and attractions may have made last-minute decisions to close. Colonial Williamsburg is already in its seasonal shutdown, although carriage rides may not be available if streets become hazardous, spokesman Joe Straw said. Anyone who wants to skate at Liberty's Ice Pavilion should call 855-296-6627 ahead of time to check if it's still open. A week preparing Lin Bell, a dairy clerk at the Richmond Road Food Lion, was bracing for a storm both inside (in the form of customers) and outside the store. "It started a little earlier this week," he said of shoppers grabbing supplies. "In the mornings, you'll see retirees and some older folks. Once the workday ends, people made a beeline for this store, trying to find adult beverages and all that." Bell said in the grocery industry, the concept is called a "snow scare." Food Lion staff expect to see milk, bread and water fly off their shelves. "Sometimes it'll even effect the toilet paper and pet food," he said. "That just depends on the severity of the storm." You see just a little bit of panic so people end up in here," Bell said. "We would have had a busier spike anyway, because it's Friday and the end of the work week. The storm coming just adds to it." Victor Martinez, a customer associate at the Walmart on East Rochambeau Drive, said the saw substantially more people on Friday afternoon than usual. "They've been buying propane, snow plows, ice melt, you name it," he said. "We're almost out of ice scrapers too." Though he noticed an uptick in patrons, Martinez himself does not necessarily plan on buying too much heading into the weekend. The main change he makes when snow hits the area is a logistical one. "My girlfriend, her car sits a little higher off the ground than mine does," he said. "Once winter comes, we don't use mine nearly as much." Charles Johnson was unfazed by the impending snow while shopping in Walmart on Friday. "I'm not really preparing too much," he said. "I really don't think it'll be that bad." He makes sure his vehicle is ready to move in case of an emergency, but he doesn't feel like this weekend could turn into one. "We've had some bad snows out here," he said. "I didn't think this one will be that big of a deal." Kevin Deaver owns Ace Peninsula Hardware on Richmond Road where shoppers have been buying snow shovels, ice melt and sleds since Tuesday. "In '98 or '99 we had some bad snowstorms," said Deaver, who recalled that 2003 had been a snowy year as well. "We had maybe three snowstorms in the span of a month. This part of Virginia isn't used to getting that much snow." Ice storms are what really concern Deaver because of the havoc they can wreak on the area. "What happens is the rain or snow falls into trees and it freezes, then the trees fall and break," he said. "They bring down power lines, and now you don't have any power." Lighter snowfall is easier to handle, Deaver said. "It's a little more fun for people." Wright can be reached by phone at 757-345-2343.

MMCT Venture, the Mashantucket Pequot-Mohegan partnership intent on developing a casino near Hartford, announced Friday afternoon that it had narrowed a field of five municipalities that filed site proposals, eliminating East Hartford, Hartford and South Windsor. Windsor Locks’ entry includes locations at Bradley International Airport, while East Windsor has offered parcels off Interstate 91 that currently are occupied by a former Showcase Cinemas building, a former Wal-Mart and an existing Big Y supermarket. In a statement, Kevin Brown, chairman of the Mohegan Tribal Council, thanked the three eliminated towns for their interest. “They could not have been better partners,” he said. “But despite a willingness to work together and a real belief in the value of this large investment, we couldn’t find a location that met our criteria.” He said the three towns still would benefit from the proposed casino, which would provide “a boost for the entire region.” Rodney Butler, the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Council chairman, said East Windsor and Windsor Locks “align best with our development models and preserve more jobs and revenue for the state.” The tribes, respective owners of Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun, hope a third Connecticut casino will lessen the impact of MGM Springfield, the $950 million resort casino being built in Massachusetts and scheduled to open in September 2018. Recently, the tribes noted, the state’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis found that the MGM project would cost the state nearly $70 million in its first year of operation. A study commissioned by the tribes found that more than 9,000 jobs could be lost if the state does nothing to counter MGM Springfield’s effect. Once the tribes settle on a casino site, they are expected to pursue legislation authorizing them to operate a commercial casino on nonreservation land. The tribes’ existing casinos are located on their reservations, where they are subject to federal regulation. MGM Resorts International, the Las Vegas-based company developing the Springfield casino, has opposed the tribes’ third-casino efforts at every turn. Friday’s announcement prompted another response. “As we have been saying all along, this isn’t a process, it’s a sham,” Alan Feldman, an MGM Resorts executive vice president, said in a statement. “... The tribes tell towns they’re in, then they’re out. ... This is not the right way for a state to enter into its first commercial casino. The right way is what we’ve been suggesting all along: The state should scrap the current law and adopt a new one that guarantees a fair, open, transparent, and most important, a competitive process — one that allows all qualified bidders to compete. ...” The rejected proposals include one a development group aggressively had pitched for a site off Interstate 84 in East Hartford. The group’s managing member, Tony Ravosa, declined to comment on the tribes’ announcement, saying he would have something to say next week at a news conference. South Windsor’s bid involved a development zone along I-291 between I-84 and I-91. No specific location was ever publicly linked to Hartford’s proposal, though the tribes have indicated they reviewed several potential sites there. MMCT Venture accepted an initial round of site proposals in 2015 and then reopened the process in the fall. East Windsor, eliminated after the first round, refiled with a new site in the second round. Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks has remained in the running despite the Connecticut Airport Authority’s withdrawal of sites it initially proposed on airport property. An authority spokeswoman confirmed Friday that the authority still is interested in hosting a casino at Bradley. b.hallenbeck@theday.com Next Article Loading comment count... Commenting is closed.

WASHINGTON (AP) " U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in December, capping a year of slower but solid hiring. Friday's report from the Labor Department portrayed a job market that remains durable 7 years after the recovery from the Great Recession began. Though the unemployment rate rose to 4.7 percent from a nine-year low of 4.6 percent, it did so for an encouraging reason: More people began looking for work. Because not all of them found jobs immediately, more people were counted as unemployed in December. Hourly pay jumped 2.9 percent from a year earlier, the sharpest increase in more than seven years. ___ Higher wages push stocks to records, but Dow misses 20,000 NEW YORK (AP) " So close! The Dow Jones industrial average missed the 20,000 mark by a fraction of a point Friday as U.S. stock indexes rose after the government said wages jumped in December. Two other major indexes set records. Stocks wavered between gains and losses in the morning after the December jobs report, which showed less hiring than analysts hoped to see. Bond yields rose sharply, as the continued job gains should encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates. Indexes turned higher as investors concluded that the rising wages will lead to more spending on technology and consumer goods. Industrial companies rose as investors hoped for greater economic growth. ___ US trade deficit climbs to $45.2 billion in November Continued below. Related Content Your views: Readers' letters National election promise to create recreational fishing-only zones running behind schedule Cartoon: Another Kiwi classic - Household debt WASHINGTON (AP) " The U.S. trade deficit in November rose to the highest level in nine months as imports of oil and other foreign goods increased, while American exports fell for a second month. The trade deficit jumped 6.8 percent to $45.2 billion, the largest imbalance since February, the Commerce Department reported Friday. Exports edged down 0.2 percent to $122.4 billion, reflecting lower overseas sales of American-made airplanes, autos and farm products. Imports rose 1.1 percent to $231.1 billion, led by a 7.6 percent jump in oil. ___ US factory orders drop 2.4 percent but investment up WASHINGTON (AP) " Orders to U.S. factories fell for the first time in five months in November, but much of the weakness reflected a swing in the volatile category of commercial aircraft. A key category that tracks business investment spending posted an increase. Factory orders dropped 2.4 percent after a 2.8 percent rise in October, the Commerce Department reported Friday. It was the first decline since June but the weakness was led by a 73.8 percent plunge in demand for commercial aircraft following a 94.5 percent surge in October. ___ US approves fix for some Volkswagen diesels DETROIT (AP) " Volkswagen will soon be able to repair some of its diesel cars so they meet U.S. emissions standards. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board said Friday that they have approved a fix for around 67,000 of the 475,000 Volkswagens and Audis with 2-liter diesel engines that were programmed to cheat on U.S. emissions tests. The German automaker acknowledged the cheating in 2015. The remedy will fix 2015 models of the Volkswagen Beetle, Beetle Convertible, Golf, Golf SportWagen, Jetta and Passat as well as the Audi A3. ___ Jamie Oliver to shut 6 UK restaurants in tough Brexit market LONDON (AP) " Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver is shutting six of his 42 Jamie's Italian restaurants in Britain amid tough trading conditions and a lower pound following Britain's vote to leave the European Union. The Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group said Friday that five restaurants in England and one in Scotland would close in the first quarter of 2017. The company has been stung by the slide in the pound, which has increased the cost of buying ingredients from Italy. Despite the pressure on prices triggered by the pound's fall, Britain's economy has outperformed many economists' expectations since the June vote. ___ Wal-Mart names John Furner as Sam's Club next CEO NEW YORK (AP) " Wal-Mart says it named John Furner as CEO of its Sam's Club stores to replace Rosalind Brewer, who is retiring next month. Furner, who is 42, will head the membership-only warehouse chain next month. Furner has been Sam's Club's chief merchandising officer since October 2015. Wal-Mart says he first joined the company as an hourly store associate in 1993. Brewer will leave her position February 1. The 54-year-old has been CEO of Sam's Club for five years and has had a variety of executive roles since joining the company about 11 years ago. ___ SeaWorld: Tilikum, orca that killed trainer, has died ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) " Tilikum the orca has died after more than two decades at SeaWorld Orlando, where he gained notoriety for killing a trainer in 2010 and was later profiled in a documentary that helped sway popular opinion against keeping killer whales in captivity. Sea World officials said Friday that Tilikum died but didn't give a cause of death. They said Tilikum had faced serious health issues including a persistent and complicated bacterial lung infection. He was estimated to be 36 years old. The 2010 death of the SeaWorld trainer shocked the public, led to a downturn in SeaWorld's attendance and reshaped its future. ___ The Limited to close all brick-and-mortar shops WASHINGTON (AP) " More grim news for malls came Friday as apparel retailer The Limited said it will close all its brick-and-mortar stores at the end of this weekend. The company says it will continue to operate online only after the Jan. 8 closures. A spokesman said the New Albany, Ohio-based chain operated about 250 retail stores in 2016 and that about 4,000 jobs, including seasonal and temporary ones, would be lost. The announcement comes on the heels of Macy's and Sears announcing store closures and job cuts. ___ APNewsBreak: L.L. Bean heiress in trouble over pro-Trump PAC AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) " The Federal Election Commission told L.L. Bean heiress Linda Bean that she made excessive contributions to a political action committee she created to support Republican President-elect Donald Trump. According to a Wednesday letter obtained by The Associated Press, federal regulators say Bean's Making America Great Again LLC was limited to individual contributions of $5,000 in a single year" and Bean contributed $60,000. The group spent $66,862 supporting Trump. The FEC letter says the group could face punitive action or an audit if it doesn't respond. ___ Starbucks to stop selling alcohol at more than 400 US stores NEW YORK (AP) " Starbucks will stop selling beer and wine at hundreds of U.S. stores next week as it ends its "evenings" program. The coffee chain says the "Starbucks Evenings" program in 439 company-owned stores in the U.S. will end Jan. 10. It said the program may continue in some of the nine licensed stores where it is offered, or overseas. The program, first tested in 2010, was later expanded as a way to drive sales beyond the morning rush. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average rose 64.51 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 19,963.80. The S&P 500 rose 7.98 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,276.98. The Nasdaq composite jumped 33.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,521.06. U.S. crude oil rose 23 cents to close at $53.99 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, added 21 cents to close at $57.10 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline slipped less than 1 cent to $1.63 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.70 a gallon. Natural gas rose 1 cent to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     Updates On Finding A Nintendo NES Classic Posted: Jan 9 2017, 11:41am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Jan 9 2017, 2:40pm CST, in News | Technology News   Photo Credit: Getty Images/Nintendo   The Nintendo NES Classic Edition is still hard to find after the Holidays. Here are the best ways to find a NES Classic in stock. Updated. The Nintendo NES Classic Edition console is still very much in demand in the first days of 2017. The reseller prices of the NES Classic have come down a bit after the Holidays, are still very high with $170.99 plus shipping. Don't Miss: Latest Science and Medical Discoveries Updates: Jan. 9: The week kicks off with low inventory levels of the NES Classic at Target and Walmart. Brickseek reports 5% and 1% respectively across all stores of the two retailers. Online availability of the NES does not exist since days. Some fans are already suspecting that Nintendo is not working on a new shipment of the NES Classic, because of the upcoming Nintendo Switch. We do not think that is the case, but it would be time for Nintendo to make an announcement regarding the NES Classic supply situation. In an new development, GameStop is reportedly receiving new NES Classic shipment on January 11. Amazon has the Nyko MiniBoss Wireless Controller for NES Classic Edition in stock in select Zip codes for $17.95. The 8Bitdo NES30 Classic Edition Wireless Controller Set with Bluetooth Retro Receiver is also in stock for $39.99. Jan. 7: The inventory situation of the NES Classic have not changed. Some Target stores have the NES in stock, but the BrickSeek inventory score of the NES at Target is still at a very low 5%. The NES Classic is though becoming more versatile. Hackers opened up the retro console to allow owners to upload more games. The hack comes out of Russia. The instructions to hack the NES Classic Edition are available. Select stores are receiving a limited numbers of NES Classic on a daily basis. The online availability of the NES Classic is dire. Shopko has sold the NES on the last day of 2016. The NES Classic was available at Best Buy online on Jan. 4 around 4pm ET. This marked the first time that the NES was sold online in days. It is time again to keep zoolert or nowinstock open in your browser and switch on the audio alerts, but there has been no new online availability.  GameStop sold some NES Bundles on December 29. Amazon has sold the NES in very limited quantities in select cities in the past days as well. Amazon has though not made any announcements about the NES Classic availability. Nintendo has not resupplied retailers with the NES Classic in a significant way. The in stock level of the NES at Target stores is at 5% according to BrickSeek. Chances that your local Target has the NES in stock are very low right now. NES hunters check the BrickSeek data of their local Target stores before midnight to see if a store will sell NES the next morning. In the unlikely case their is a NES in stock, buyers have to get to the store still early before the doors open. The demand is still extremely high. Resellers offer the NES on the Amazon marketplace are $170 and up. People report to have found a NES Classic in stock at stores including Target and Walmart. The tool of choice to spot the limited NES inventory is as always Brick Seek. The SKU for the NES is 207-29-0180. The service is working best for Target stores. The reported numbers are always to be taken with a grain of salt. The discussion group at InStockNow's NES tracking page is a good starting point ot find leads to stores that have the NES in stock.  Nintendo is under criticism for bad demand forecasting since years. Part of it is intentional as shortage generates buzz. The downside are the countless hours of people spent in line and the caused frustration. There is no update from Nintendo when the Japanese video game maker will resolve the shortage. The $59.99 Nintendo NES Classic Edition console launched on November 11 in stores and online. The supply was extremely constraint in stores and especially online. Even NES accessories are hard to come by. Resellers offer the NES on the Amazon marketplace are $170 and more. On launch day Nintendo said: "The Nintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition system is a hot item, and we are working hard to keep up with consumer demand. There will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year. Please contact your local retailers to check availability." The palm-sized NES console, retailing for $59.99 list price, features the classic Nintendo NES controller many geeks have grown up with. The retro console comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES games including Super Mario Bros., Pac-Man, Metroid, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby's Adventures. The NES Classic Edition system is a miniaturized version of the groundbreaking NES, originally released in 1985. The NES Classic Edition comes only with a single wired controller. There are 3rd party controllers and accessories that make the NES more fun to use. Gamers can get additional controllers and even wireless controllers. The Holiday shopping season 2016 has been dominated by the hunt for Hatchimals and the Nintendo NES classic edition. In a short three months the new Nintendo Switch will go sale and Nintendo fans brace for the worst. We at I4U News have already pre-ordered the Nintendo Switch at Europe's largest consumer electronics chain. Find out everything we know about the Nintendo Switch launch.

UNCENSORED Why Traditional Companies Are Racing to Acquire Tech Startups Tune into this week's podcast to hear about how buying tech startups is now a strategy for traditional companies to stave off disruption. By Will Yakowicz Will Yakowicz is an award-winning journalist and a staff writer and podcaster for Inc. magazine. Before Inc., he reported from the West Bank and Moscow for Tablet Magazine; he covered business, crime, and local politics for The Brooklyn Paper; and he was the editor of Park Slope Patch. He lives in Brooklyn, New York. @WillYakowicz Staff writer, Inc.@WillYakowicz WRITE A COMMENT Walmart acquired e-commerce company Jet.com for $3.3 billion in 2016. But the big box store company's acquisition of a tech company is not unique, last year traditional companies outpaced larger tech companies in tech startup acquisitions. CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Welcome to the 98th episode of Inc. Uncensored podcast, hosted by Inc. editor Jim Ledbetter. This week, senior editor Danielle Sacks talks about how 2016 marked the first year that traditional companies outpaced tech giants in acquiring tech startups. In 2016, Google, IMB and Facebook didn't spend a substantial amount of money to acquire tech companies while Walmart, GM and Scotts Miracle Grow all spent billions each acquiring tech startups. Sacks explains how in 2012, traditional companies spent $20 billion on acquisitions compared to last year when traditional companies spent $125 billion on acquisitions, many of which were tech companies. Companies like Campbell's Soup and JetBlue both launched their own venture capital arms in an effort to survive in the long run. Sacks says the acquisition strategy by traditional companies should not be surprising as small startups like Amazon have turned into disruptive superpowers. Jim Ledbetter swaps spots and does his own segment about how mobile game apps use the warped economics of casino games to convince players to spend money on in-app purchases that do not have value except for a short thrill. Ledbetter explains that he believes mobile games, which are free to play, urge players to spend money on things like longer game-play time or digital goods, warps "kids' understanding of basic economic ideas." Tune in to learn about the ethics of design and how the freedom model could be distorting society's sense of value and how money should be spent. Lastly, the crew interviews Jeff Lawson for the podcast's Exit Interview segment. Lawson talks about how he co-founded Twilio, built the communications platform to power the likes of Uber and Airbnb and brought it public in 2016.

If you’re looking for someone to blame, try Walmart and Verizon, two components of the index that fell in the day’s trading. The Nasdaq composite index and S&P 500 also posted record finishes. Yah-oh-no! Yahoo Finance got roundly mocked on Twitter after it made a really bad mistake when it pushed out a story about President-elect Donald Trump’s military plans. It was supposed to say, “Trump wants a much bigger navy,” only with the worst possible typo instead of “bigger.” And no, it wasn’t “Tigger.” And no, we don’t think Yahoo can blame hackers for this one. The company apologized for the “spelling error.” Today in Trump tweets “Wow, the ratings are in and Arnold Schwarzenegger got ‘swamped’ (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine, DJT. So much for ...” Yes, that was about “Celebrity Apprentice,” and it even drew a response tweet from California’s former governor: “I wish you the best of luck and I hope you'll work for ALL of the American people as aggressively as you worked for your ratings.” The Daily Briefing is compiled from San Francisco Chronicle staff and news services.

Considering this accelerating reality, organizations need to transform their business models to keep pace or they will fall prey to today's digital elite. In The Network Imperative, Barry Libert, Megan Beck, and Jerry Wind demonstrate how incumbent (non-digital, non-network, non-platform) organizations can grow and profit by shifting their capital (time and money) from tangible, physical, firm-based offerings to embracing intangible, digital, network-based business models. The authors provide 10 levers every organization can pull and a 5-step process to pivot toward greater growth and profits in today's hyperconnected world. The author believes that today's digital network businesses--best exemplified by Amazon, Alphabet (aka Google), Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft--deliver far greater growth, profits, and value than traditional, incumbent firms like Walmart, GE, GM, and Boeing. However, the best practices they have implemented in their firms are available to every organization. They include: 1. Recognizing the value of digital networks and platforms. Organizations that invest their resources in digital platforms and virtual network business models outpace the market by growing faster, scaling with lower marginal costs, and generating greater value. Leaders, partners, and customers of network organizations also benefit from the fulfilling, mutually rewarding relationships that successful network organizations create. 2. Developing digital strategies and platforms to create network effect. Network and platform organizations operate with a different mindset than traditional organizations. They see excess capacity and under-utilization (homes, friends, knowledge, and capabilities) where others see limited opportunity and full utilization. They focus on "access" versus assets. 3. Implementing customized network and platform business models. Business leaders can customize their growth and profits by identifying their current business models, evaluating all their assets (especially intangibles), envisioning their new digital business models, building the right team and board, and measuring the right metrics using today's machine learning and big data. 4. Becoming network leaders in every sector. Top-performing business leaders are adaptive. They invert their old beliefs, take in new ideas, and adjust their mental models to operate in new ways that focus less on what they have or do and more on what the network has, can do, and can offer. In addition, they are open to exploring new ventures and business models as market needs change.

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in December, capping a year of slower but solid hiring. Friday's report from the Labor Department portrayed a job market that remains durable 7½ years after the recovery from the Great Recession began. Though the unemployment rate rose to 4.7 percent from a nine-year low of 4.6 percent, it did so for an encouraging reason: More people began looking for work. Because not all of them found jobs immediately, more people were counted as unemployed in December. Hourly pay jumped 2.9 percent from a year earlier, the sharpest increase in more than seven years. ___ Higher wages push stocks to records, but Dow misses 20,000 NEW YORK (AP) — So close! The Dow Jones industrial average missed the 20,000 mark by a fraction of a point Friday as U.S. stock indexes rose after the government said wages jumped in December. Two other major indexes set records. Stocks wavered between gains and losses in the morning after the December jobs report, which showed less hiring than analysts hoped to see. Bond yields rose sharply, as the continued job gains should encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates. Indexes turned higher as investors concluded that the rising wages will lead to more spending on technology and consumer goods. Industrial companies rose as investors hoped for greater economic growth. ___ US trade deficit climbs to $45.2 billion in November WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. trade deficit in November rose to the highest level in nine months as imports of oil and other foreign goods increased, while American exports fell for a second month. The trade deficit jumped 6.8 percent to $45.2 billion, the largest imbalance since February, the Commerce Department reported Friday. Exports edged down 0.2 percent to $122.4 billion, reflecting lower overseas sales of American-made airplanes, autos and farm products. Imports rose 1.1 percent to $231.1 billion, led by a 7.6 percent jump in oil. ___ US factory orders drop 2.4 percent but investment up WASHINGTON (AP) — Orders to U.S. factories fell for the first time in five months in November, but much of the weakness reflected a swing in the volatile category of commercial aircraft. A key category that tracks business investment spending posted an increase. Factory orders dropped 2.4 percent after a 2.8 percent rise in October, the Commerce Department reported Friday. It was the first decline since June but the weakness was led by a 73.8 percent plunge in demand for commercial aircraft following a 94.5 percent surge in October. ___ US approves fix for some Volkswagen diesels DETROIT (AP) — Volkswagen will soon be able to repair some of its diesel cars so they meet U.S. emissions standards. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board said Friday that they have approved a fix for around 67,000 of the 475,000 Volkswagens and Audis with 2-liter diesel engines that were programmed to cheat on U.S. emissions tests. The German automaker acknowledged the cheating in 2015. The remedy will fix 2015 models of the Volkswagen Beetle, Beetle Convertible, Golf, Golf SportWagen, Jetta and Passat as well as the Audi A3. ___ Jamie Oliver to shut 6 UK restaurants in tough Brexit market LONDON (AP) — Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver is shutting six of his 42 Jamie's Italian restaurants in Britain amid tough trading conditions and a lower pound following Britain's vote to leave the European Union. The Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group said Friday that five restaurants in England and one in Scotland would close in the first quarter of 2017. The company has been stung by the slide in the pound, which has increased the cost of buying ingredients from Italy. Despite the pressure on prices triggered by the pound's fall, Britain's economy has outperformed many economists' expectations since the June vote. ___ Wal-Mart names John Furner as Sam's Club next CEO NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart says it named John Furner as CEO of its Sam's Club stores to replace Rosalind Brewer, who is retiring next month. Furner, who is 42, will head the membership-only warehouse chain next month. Furner has been Sam's Club's chief merchandising officer since October 2015. Wal-Mart says he first joined the company as an hourly store associate in 1993. Brewer will leave her position February 1. The 54-year-old has been CEO of Sam's Club for five years and has had a variety of executive roles since joining the company about 11 years ago. ___ SeaWorld: Tilikum, orca that killed trainer, has died ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Tilikum the orca has died after more than two decades at SeaWorld Orlando, where he gained notoriety for killing a trainer in 2010 and was later profiled in a documentary that helped sway popular opinion against keeping killer whales in captivity. Sea World officials said Friday that Tilikum died but didn't give a cause of death. They said Tilikum had faced serious health issues including a persistent and complicated bacterial lung infection. He was estimated to be 36 years old. The 2010 death of the SeaWorld trainer shocked the public, led to a downturn in SeaWorld's attendance and reshaped its future. ___ The Limited to close all brick-and-mortar shops WASHINGTON (AP) — More grim news for malls came Friday as apparel retailer The Limited said it will close all its brick-and-mortar stores at the end of this weekend. The company says it will continue to operate online only after the Jan. 8 closures. A spokesman said the New Albany, Ohio-based chain operated about 250 retail stores in 2016 and that about 4,000 jobs, including seasonal and temporary ones, would be lost. The announcement comes on the heels of Macy's and Sears announcing store closures and job cuts. ___ APNewsBreak: L.L. Bean heiress in trouble over pro-Trump PAC AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — The Federal Election Commission told L.L. Bean heiress Linda Bean that she made excessive contributions to a political action committee she created to support Republican President-elect Donald Trump. According to a Wednesday letter obtained by The Associated Press, federal regulators say Bean's Making America Great Again LLC was limited to individual contributions of $5,000 in a single year— and Bean contributed $60,000. The group spent $66,862 supporting Trump. The FEC letter says the group could face punitive action or an audit if it doesn't respond. ___ Starbucks to stop selling alcohol at more than 400 US stores NEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks will stop selling beer and wine at hundreds of U.S. stores next week as it ends its "evenings" program. The coffee chain says the "Starbucks Evenings" program in 439 company-owned stores in the U.S. will end Jan. 10. It said the program may continue in some of the nine licensed stores where it is offered, or overseas. The program, first tested in 2010, was later expanded as a way to drive sales beyond the morning rush.

January 6, 2017 City Psychiatric Examiners Disagree Over Competency of Alleged Walmart Murderer By Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs | January 6, 2017 LikeTweet EmailPrint More More on City Subscribe to City Follow this author Two psychiatric examiners came to opposite conclusions after evaluating the Ithaca man who said he “shot and killed Donald Trump purposely, intentionally and very proudly,” and who is facing a murder charge for allegedly shooting and driving over a UPS driver in the Ithaca Walmart parking lot. One of the examiners who evaluated Justin Barkley, 38, determined that he would be able to understand the court proceedings and assist in his own defense, while the other declared him incompetent to do so, Tompkins County Judge John C. Rowley said in court on Friday. When two examiners disagree, a third psychiatric examiner must evaluate the defendant “to determine if he is an incapacitated person,” according to New York State law. The third examination will begin next week, Assistant District Attorney Eliza Filipowski said. Rowley also scheduled a hearing for later in January to discuss the “conflicting reports.” Leaderboard 1 <a href="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=74458bb90a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538220187&cs=74458bb90a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> <a href="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=8cd4e36b59&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873873&cs=8cd4e36b59&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Police say Barkley used a .30-06 caliber rifle to shoot William Schumacher, 52, of Candor, in the chest on Dec. 8 before driving over the victim and fleeing to his residence on Dryden Road. Trailed by police, Barkley fired what he called a “sound shot” at officers to keep them from exiting their vehicles as he entered his home, commencing a nine-hour standoff with authorities from several departments. Barkley ultimately surrendered peacefully after police used a robot to communicate with him, Ithaca Police Chief John Barber said. He is charged with murder in the second degree — a class A-1 felony — and menacing a police officer or peace officer — a class D felony — and is being held in Tompkins County Jail without the option for bail. Barkley appeared in court Friday wearing an orange jail jumpsuit marked 2XL with his hands and legs shackled. He scanned the gallery briefly before taking a seat next to his attorney, James Baker.

Baker and Van Houten both declined to comment on whether they believe Barkley is competent to stand trial, noting that the determination is up to the experts. Rowley set a tentative court appearance for Jan. 19 relating to the conflicting reports and said the psychiatric examiners may be present for the appearance. Van Houten said it hasn’t yet been determined whether that hearing will be open to the public. The examiners’ evaluations are currently sealed under Judge Rowley’s orders.

January 6, 2017 Editorial By Eduardo Landeros Eduardo Landeros MBA In business, having a competitive advantage is one of the most important things you can have if you want to succeed. A competitive advantage is something that differentiates your business from the rest and makes you stand out. Entrepreneurs should always be asking themselves the following question: “what is the one thing customers like about my business that other businesses don’t have?” If it’s nothing, then you have some re-structuring to do.  It sounds simple, and there’s more beneath the surface, but it does apply to every business? Whether you are a small business owner or a large global corporation, the principle is the same.  This is how some businesses have been able to survive for many years and have succeeded in today’s very competitive and evolving business world. McDonald’s is a good example of having a strong competitive advantage.  If you look at the fast food industry, particularly in the burger arena, you’ll see that the brands that have survived over the years are the ones that have a clear competitive advantage. McDonald’s doesn’t have the best quality food out there, although their fries in my opinion are one of the best, but they do have something that others don’t:  the best meals and play areas for kids. As a parent myself, I use to go to McDonalds periodically because it was an experience for my children.  Not because their food was great or even because their service was fast, but because my children wanted a toy from the latest movie out there and wanted to spent a couple of minutes running around in their play area.  Even though my wife hated it, we would still do it for the kids. When analyzing McDonalds’ successful marketing efforts it is very clear that they are targeting the decision makers in the family which are not the parents. McDonald’s is still the number one burger chain in the U.S., and probably in the world. Other fast food restaurants have tried to compete with McDonald’s over the years by establishing a competitive advantage and offering something different.  The Six Dollar Burger comes to mind when I think of Carl’s Jr.  When their commercials use the sex appeal of  models washing cars, it’s obvious they’re trying to market to men in general who want a big meal.  Value menus or 99 cents items come to mind when I think of Jack in the Box.  In analyzing their commercials, Jack in the Box is trying to compete by offering low price items and targeting the price sensitive market such as college students. Retail stores also come to mind when analyzing competitive advantages.  It is obvious that Wal-Mart competes with low price items, but what about Costco? What Costco’s competitive advantage? Costco is unique in that they offer high quality products at very reasonable prices if you’re willing to pay for quantity. However, this advantage might not appeal to all; not every family needs 20 lbs of rib eye steaks or 30 rolls of toilet paper. Costco is able to compete with Wal-Mart and other grocery stores because they do things a little different.  Instead of spending money in a good looking store, or a million dollar marketing campaign, they spend their money taking care of their employees and negotiating good prices for their consumers.  So when it comes to quantity buying, they are usually cheaper than many retailers out there.  But all in all, it’s not that Costco is better than Wal-Mart.  They’re just different and they’re able to differentiate their companies by establishing a good competitive advantage. So what makes your business different than the rest? Many like to compete by offering low prices, but they need to be careful and make sure the numbers work out.  If you are able to compete with low prices, make sure you’re making money at the end of the day.  In my career, I’ve seen many businesses fail because they end up decreasing their margins and working for free.   How about competing with something different like better service, better products, or more convenience?  Maybe you’ll be the only one that offers free delivery or a loyalty program. However you choose to compete, make sure you have a clear understanding of what you want to accomplish, analyze the numbers, and stick to it!   Be Sociable, Share!

Sam’s Club CEO Exiting As Company Moves To Win Over Costco Shoppers Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Sam’s Club CEO Exiting As Company Moves To Win Over Costco Shoppers Image courtesy of Mike Mozart January 6, 2017 2:55 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler See Ya Later costco sam's club retail ceo rosalind brewer Stepping Down retiring groceries In recent years, Sam’s Club CEO Rosalind Brewer has led the warehouse store’s efforts to compete for Costco’s more affluent shoppers, but as sales at the Walmart-owned chain remain unremarkable, Brewer will soon retire. Sam’s Club announced Brewer’s impending departure in an SEC filing [PDF] Friday, noting that she would retire from the company effective Feb. 1 after spending five years at the helm of the retailer. Brewer will be replaced by current Sam’s Club chief merchant John Furner. Under Brewer’s lead, Sam’s Club has implemented several initiatives intended to undercut its rival Costco. For example, last summer, the company took advantage of Costco’s switch from an American Express-branded store card to Visa by parodying the other company’s signage and offering Costco card holders the opportunity to enter the store and browse. For its part, Sam’s Club began accepting both Visa and American Express cards in early 2016. (Related — Costco Vs. Sam’s Club: Which Warehouse Club Should You Choose?) In Feb. 2016, Sam’s Club made plans to overhaul its biggest-selling category — groceries — by focusing on just one house brand, Member’s Mark, as well as adding more organic and specialty fine foods to its aisles. At the time, Brewer told Fortune that the changes were a “reset for our business,” noting that the company knows that in order to compete with Costco and other retailers it must “win in food.” Still, Fortune reports that despite the initiatives Sam’s Club continues to struggle to close the gap, as its recent 1.4% growth wasn’t enough to meet Costco’s sales.

La Monica   @lamonicabuzz January 6, 2017: 12:02 PM ET See how Amazon packages ship with less than :60 in human hands Did you buy nearly all your presents for the holidays at Amazon? I did. And I must not be alone. Jeff Bezos is the new Santa Claus. But to the rest of retail, Bezos is the evil Krampus that's punishing them all for their naughty behavior. Consider this. Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) is now worth more than these 10 well-known retailers combined: Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS), Sears (SHLD), JCPenney (JCP), Nordstrom (JWN), Best Buy (BBY), Barnes & Noble (BKS), Dillard's (DDS), Gap (GPS) and Target (TGT). In fact, it's not even close. Related: Macy's is closing 68 stores, cutting 1,000 jobs Amazon's market value is just north of $370 billion. These other retailers are collectively worth a little less than $95 billion. And a big chunk of that is from Target, which has a market value of $40 billion. Amazon also is worth significantly more than other global retail giants. Its market value is about $135 billion higher than Alibaba's (BABA, Tech30) and $160 billion more than Walmart (WMT). Amazon is worth more than twice as much as Home Depot (HD), and six times as much as Lowe's (LOW). The company is much more valuable than another famous retailer based in the state of Washington too -- Costco (COST). That warehouse giant, which is increasingly competing with Amazon in the grocery business, is worth about $300 billion less than Amazon. Related: Sears and Kmart closing 150 stores Traditional retailers are doing all they can to compete with Amazon. But it looks like they are going to have to use the old Avis (CAR) rental car motto and try harder. JCPenney joined Macy's and Kohl's Friday morning by reporting disappointing results for the holidays. "Brands like Macy's, Sears, and Kmart are struggling to evolve their brands and stay relevant for today's digitally-savvy and dynamic shopper," said Forrester retail analyst Brendan Witcher. No kidding. And the stock performance of all these retailers clearly show that many retailers are also to struggling to remain relevant with digitally-savvy and dynamic investors as well. Amazon, for better or worse, is the only major retail stock that Wall Street wants to put in its shopping cart.

Video posted to Facebook shows Nikki Smith reacting to an empty — completely empty — bread aisle at Walmart, wailing and sliding dramatically when she notices there is no bread. She said the video is simply meant to bring humor to the situation. “I just wanted to do something funny about how everyone reacts to the snow in South Carolina,” Smith told WHNS. “I went out to see if there was any bread and it was all gone.

U.S. stocks are dipping Friday, Jan. 6, 2017, after a solid but unspectacular hiring report for the month of December. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Posted: Friday, January 6, 2017 11:39 am | Updated: 7:27 am, Sat Jan 7, 2017. Higher wages push stocks to records, but Dow misses 20,000 Associated Press | 0 comments NEW YORK (AP) — So close! The Dow Jones industrial average missed the 20,000 mark by a fraction of a point Friday as U.S. stock indexes rose after the government said wages jumped in December. Two other major indexes set records. Stocks wavered between gains and losses in the morning after the December jobs report, which showed less hiring than analysts hoped to see. Bond yields rose sharply, as the continued job gains should encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates. Indexes turned higher as investors concluded that the rising wages will lead to more spending on technology and consumer goods. Industrial companies rose as investors hoped for greater economic growth. Sam Stovall, a U.S. equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ, said there was good news for most industries. That's because workers are being paid more, but the report won't push the Fed to raise rates quickly in order to stave off inflation. "Consumers are earning a bit more and as a result can spend more," he said. "But ... people are not too worried the Fed will have to slam on the brakes." At about 12:40 p.m. the Dow peaked at 19,999.63, but later lost steam. It finished up 64.51 points, or 0.3 percent, at 19,963.80. The S&P 500 rose 7.98 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,276.98. The Nasdaq composite jumped 33.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,521.06. The small-cap Russell 2000 index slid 4.65 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,367.28. Stocks finished the week with a big gain as investors remained optimistic about the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 climbed 1.7 percent. That was a marked change from last year, when the index lost 6 percent as the market got off to its worst opening week in history. The Labor Department said U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in December, which was solid but slightly disappointing. However the government said hourly pay jumped 2.9 percent from December 2015, the biggest monthly increase in seven years. Overall, job growth remained steady in 2016 but slowed a bit from 2015. The biggest gains went to companies that stand to benefit from higher wages and greater spending by consumers. Among technology companies, Facebook rose $2.74, or 2.3 percent, to $123.41 and Apple gained $1.30, or 1.1 percent, to $117.91. Amazon had its second big gain in a row and added $15.54, or 2 percent, to $795.99 while travel website TripAdvisor picked up $1.57, or 3.2 percent, to $50.77. Industrial companies, which have climbed since the presidential election two months ago, also fared well. Machinery and equipment maker Honeywell rose $1.77, or 1.5 percent, to $118.53. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.42 percent from 2.35 percent. Higher bond yields mean higher interest rates, which allow banks to make more money on lending. Investment banks and other financial firms did better than the rest of the market Friday afternoon. SunTrust Banks rose 63 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $55.53 and Goldman Sachs jumped $3.58, or 1.5 percent, to $244.90. Companies that pay large dividends, including phone companies and real estate investment trusts, lagged the market as bond yields rose. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because of the steady income they provide. AT&T gave up 84 cents, or 2 percent, to $41.32 and Crown Castle International fell $1.74, or 2 percent, to $85.50. Amgen climbed and Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell after a court moved to block sales of Sanofi and Regeneron's cholesterol drug Praluent. A federal jury ruled in March that Praluent infringes on two patents that belong to Amgen. Both are costly biotech drugs designed to be injected once or twice a month. Sanofi and Regeneron said they will appeal the ruling, which came from U.S. District Court in Delaware. Amgen stock gained $3.80, or 2.5 percent, to $156.78 while Regeneron slid $22.24, or 5.8 percent, to $358.68 and Sanofi lost $1.18, or 2.8 percent, to $40.32. The dollar rose to 117.02 yen from 115.62 yen after a dip Thursday. The euro slipped to $1.0532 from $1.0590. U.S. crude oil rose 23 cents to close at $53.99 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, added 21 cents to close at $57.10 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline slipped less than 1 cent to $1.63 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.70 a gallon. Natural gas rose 1 cent to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $7.90 to $1,173.40 an ounce. Silver sank 12 cents to $16.52 an ounce. Copper rose 1 cent to $2.55 a pound. The FTSE 100 index in Britain inched up 0.2 percent. It's risen nine days in a row and is at all-time highs. Germany's DAX edged up 0.1 percent and the CAC-40 of France rose 0.2 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 0.3 percent while the Kospi in South Korea added 0.4 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng advanced 0.2 percent. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay © 2017 The Associated Press.

But unlike Santa, this one was more into taking than giving, authorities said. Gawad Dalia, 31, of North Bergen, was arrested shortly after 1 a.m. on Dec. 25 and charged with attempting to burglarize a storage trailer in the superstore's parking lot - after several previous attempts were reported, Secaucus police said. "We had several other burglaries on different dates into those trailers, and on this particular date (Dalia) was observed by (security guards) in the area ... breaking into the trailers," police Capt. Dennis Miller said. Security personnel had called Secaucus police on Dec. 23 after recognizing Dalia's vehicle on two prior occasions, but he fled before police arrived, Miller said. Fortunately for police, Dalia decided to come back to the trailer to try again, Miller said. He was arrested Christmas morning and enough evidence was obtained - a crow bar, pliers and a flashlight - to charge him with the burglary of the trailer, according to Miller. Dalia was charged with burglary, hindering apprehension, possession of burglar tools and criminal mischief. His bail was set at $30,000 with a 10 percent cash option. He was later remanded to the Hudson County jail. Four days later, another arrest was made at the Walmart - this time for shoplifting in the store. William Velez, 29, of East Orange, was arrested and charged with shoplifting after attempting to walk out of the store with $1,072 worth of electronics, according to Miller. He was also charged with a prescription drug offense when he was found to be in possession of six Xanax pills, Miller said.

BY Seth Kershner Share TweetReddit2 StumbleUpon8EmailPrint Email this article to a friend your email your name recipient(s) email (comma separated) message captcha The drumbeat of anti-unionism typically begins as soon as new employees begin their training. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)   Retail is the nation’s largest employer. Since 1980, the number of jobs in retail has reportedly grown nearly 50 percent, from 10.2 to 15.1 million. At the same time, real wages for retail workers have fallen by 11 percent while on-call scheduling, involuntary part-time work and “clopening”—where workers are required to lock up the store late at night and reopen the next morning—have wreaked havoc with workers’ lives. Not surprisingly, the retail sector also has one of the lowest rates of unionization in the economy—around the 5 percent mark under which unions have virtually no influence. It didn’t used to be this way. Retail had 15 percent union density in the 1970s, according to sociologist Peter Ikeler, with the density rate in grocery stores surpassing 31 percent at its peak in 1983. But, as with the rest of the labor movement, retail unionism has taken a steep fall since the early 1980s. How did it go so wrong? “There are a lot of parts to that puzzle,” says Ikeler, a sociologist at the State University of New York College at Old Westbury and author of the book, Hard Sell: Work and Resistance in Retail Chains.  Ikeler cites the general trend towards de-unionization of the U.S. workforce and the hollowing out of the National Labor Relations Act system through case law and employer challenges. But the most important factor in the fall of retail unionism, Ikeler argues, has been employer hostility. “The climate for labor organizing in retail is pretty explicitly negative,” Ikeler says. In a case Ikeler describes in his book, the public was able to get a glimpse of Target’s anti-union strategies—including mandatory film screenings and employees threatened with dismissal for talking about the union—during a highly publicized 2011 campaign to keep the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) from organizing one of its stores on Long Island. And across the retail industry, Target is far from unique. The drumbeat of anti-unionism typically begins as soon as new employees begin their training. New worker orientations at Walmart, the nation’s leading retailer, used to include a video that featured lines like: “The truth is unions are businesses, multimillion-dollar businesses that make their money by convincing people like you and me to give them a part of our paychecks.” According to The Atlantic, labor experts who had examined the entire video after it was leaked to the press found that it contained “blatant untruths in many of the video’s pro-company and anti-union statements.” Even smaller, regional chains invest in anti-union propaganda for new hires. According to internal documents provided to In These Times by an employee of Big Y, the Massachusetts-based grocer warns new hires about signing a union authorization card since the company’s “continued success” would be “jeopardized through third party involvement.” To research his book, Ikeler interviewed workers at Macy’s and Target stores in the New York City area. Many reported knowing that managers disapproved of unions. Several Target workers told Ikeler they were sure their jobs would be in jeopardy if they advocated for unions and reported that they knew people who’d been fired for union activity. When contacted for comment, a Target spokeswoman said that the company “believes in solving issues and concerns with the help and input of our team.” “At Target we have a longstanding commitment to our team that we will work together to create an environment of mutual trust between Target and our team members,” wrote Molly Snyder. Unions’ strategic missteps While employer resistance played the biggest role in the decline of retail unionism, Ikeler believes that unions also share part of the blame. Specifically, he thinks that unions have done a lousy job of keeping workers engaged. Ikeler points out that surveys indicate that around 13 percent of grocery store workers in the New York City area say they belong to a union. This is in contrast to the unions themselves, which say they represent a much larger share of such workers in the Big Apple. “What I think this huge disparity demonstrates,” Ikeler tells In These Times, “is that there are a fair number of workers who aren’t aware they’re in a union—it’s just something that comes out of their check every month. Sure, they might be organized in some bureaucratic sense—just not in any meaningful fighting capacity.” In Ikeler’s view, labor unions need to step up their organizing and “get back to what unions were in their early New Deal days: more worker-based rather these large staff-run, top-heavy entities that give lots of money to Democratic candidates every few years with relatively little payback.” A construct that can be challenged Ikeler also sees a lot of potential in the worker center model. Worker centers like the Retail Action Project, which Ikeler has studied extensively, give workers a place to go to form communities, talk about work conditions and plan campaigns. Another clear benefit is that worker centers help cultivate a sense of occupational identity in a sector of the economy known for deskilling workers in order to make them more easily replaceable. “A strong occupational identity—where workers are very committed to a craft, to an occupation—this has often been a source of collective identity and resistance,” Ikeler says. “If workers see themselves as part of an occupational community they may be more likely to form organizations together and put up collective resistance.” Worker centers can’t replace unions, but the two types of organizations can work together. “To see success,” Ikeler says, “to see large-scale organizing and an advance for the low-wage service sector, we’re going to have to see greater synergy than we’ve previously seen between worker centers and national unions that are actually willing to take risks and use some of their treasury by going on strike.” When asked if he saw any bright spots on the retail scene today, Ikeler pointed to a recent victory by Stop & Shop workers in New England. After threatening to strike in February, the UFCW negotiated a favorable contract for its 35,000 members in the region, including a quicker route to a $15 hourly wage and a promise from the company to add 480 new full time jobs over the next three years. The victory calls to mind an uplifting passage from Hard Sell, where Ikeler writes that “bad” service jobs are “not an unalterable fact of life but a social construct that can be challenged.” Never has independent journalism mattered more.

America’s Tween Soldiers View Comments "recent victory by Stop & Shop workers" Great to learn retail workers can win. Seems the great challenges to food retail unionization would be a) rapid turnover - students going to school, or workers looking for jobs that are more challenging, or that have higher status, or higher pay - and b) ease of replacing workers by drawing on a 'short-term' labor pool. On the other hand, retail food services cannot be moved out of the country, carried out via internet, nor - despite some self-service machines in some retail outlets - significantly automated. The food industry in particular needs a sizable worker base. Union outcomes may depend on particular factors: anti-union business practices are a given that may vary from state to state; but, on the other hand, politicized support groups (political parties, civic organizations, unions, newspapers) may strengthen negotiation and strike actions. The above also goes for unionism in the building trades, where outsourcing and automation are - outside of science fiction scenarios - not possible. Spontaneous strike-action-support-groups - students w/spare time, retirees, teachers between classes, spouses not working - could look at a single 'strike actions in your community' website to join up with particular actions. Posted by abramawicz on 2017-01-10 16:52:14 Unions mainstay for years has been people with tax funded jobs. - before that they were for the laborers in the factories. They turned their backs on retail workers and minimum wage earners - guess why - they don't make enough to pay dues. Now their need to replenish and build new Political Action Committees Funds(PAC's) is driving them into every niche of society/work force. Unions have provide a much needed voice for workers in America. They brought the steel mills and auto industries throughout the 1950-2000! Now its almost all been automated - dues paying members replaced by robotic machines. What will they do for minimum wage and retail sales workers ? Just askin ?

EPA/SHAWN THEW Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Most family businesses don’t have to work out how they will survive the boss taking over as president of the United States. Donald Trump has been forced to distance himself from the family firm since winning the US election. He even said: “I don’t care about my company. It doesn’t matter. My kids run it.” It is perhaps an extreme example of the pressures that swirl around the businesses at the heart of many economies, but it does signal the unique pressures which come to bear when trying to sustain an organisation through the generations. Family businesses cross a variety of cultures, religions and backgrounds. The chocolate manufacturers Rowntree’s, Fry’s and Cadbury’s, the shoemakers Clarks and the bankers Barclays and Lloyds all became large businesses after being started by Quaker families. They went into business in part because they were excluded from other aspects of public life in the 18th and 19th centuries, and along the way earned a reputation for looking after their workforces. More recent examples include small, local family retailers set up by South Asian immigrants in the UK who want to support the next generation either in the business or in another profession. Crash Family businesses can last a long time. While trying to make gold from base metals, an Armenian alchemist discovered a different type of “gold” – a metal alloy that had outstanding sound quality and power when made into musical cymbals. A few years later, in 1623, the Zildjian Cymbal Company was founded, and can be traced through 16 generations and nearly four centuries to today’s firm in Massachusetts. Family symbol. Alan Levine/Flickr, CC BY Many key family businesses have survived the test of time after opening ownership beyond the family, although often the original families still control a significant stake in the company. The list includes modern-day giants like Wal-Mart Stores and Ford Motors in the US, L’Oreal in France, Benetton in Italy, Samsung in Korea, Sainsbury’s in the UK and Siemens in Germany. The Indian company Tata has, however, recently been suffering in the media glare due to an acrimonious falling out between family members in senior positions. The fact is that most businesses are family owned. In the UK some 71% of all small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which employ up to 250 people are family owned. Given those multinational success stories above, it might be surprising to learn that up to 95% do not survive in family ownership by the third generation. Happy Shopper? Mike Kalasnik/Flickr, CC BY-SA Some reasons for this may lie in the common criticisms of family businesses. They have been accused of sometimes having poor management and discipline, inadequate funding to support growth, differing incentives between family members and a lack of formalised practices and procedures. They can fall foul of time consuming family conflict, slow decision making, risk avoidance, limited innovation and a strategy which favours the status quo rather than change. Multiple motivations So how do you build a sustainable family businesses? First, it is important to consider how the rationalities underpinning the behaviours and strategies of family firms vary from those of others, especially small businesses. Let’s assume that a well-run SME is driven entirely by “market rationalities” which focus entirely on business needs and without the interference of motivations linked to the family ownership. It can be argued then that family businesses are more likely to be profit satisficers (balancing other objectives with achieving a minimum level of profit) rather than profit maximisers. Relationships between family members – both good and bad, or short and long term – can carry over into the business and influence how things are decided. These challenge assumptions of purely economic rational decision making in family firms, particularly when combined with cognitive and behavioural biases such as preferring those who are like us, or feeling that the value of a loss is much more than that of an equivalent gain. Getting down to business. Colleen Kelly/Flickr, CC BY One way of looking at family firms suggests that we should accept that the family, business and social lives of those running a company must be seen as operating together: relationships overlap; family, friends and business logic or rationalities combine to influence behaviour and decision-making. Fundamentally, family aims and values can result in business decisions that differ from non-family firms. They may be reluctant to hire people from outside the family or they may adopt technology in a less flexible way as they are tied to existing ways of doing things and to existing staff and other assets. Supporting family businesses One implication is that support for small businesses, and companies with high growth potential, should not assume that family and other firms are identical. It may be that policies need to be carefully adapted for family firms. Support such as stimulating demand, changing public attitudes towards entrepreneurship, supporting research and development and the take-up of new technology, as well as providing training, advice and financial assistance all need to be adapted to take account of the differences between family and non-family firms. Emphasis also needs to be placed on developing partnerships and engagement with others, including family members and employees. Success for family businesses should not be considered just in terms of survival. A few family businesses will develop into future market leaders even if their ownership changes, and these need to be nurtured. As family businesses make up such a crucial part of both everyday and high growth firms, research and policies need to consider those more rounded perspectives that incorporate the complex bonds and motivations that mark family firms out from the rest. Fortunately, not all will have to factor in a startling political rise that leaves the owner preparing to move into the White House amid a media furore about many potential conflicts of interest.

La Monica   @lamonicabuzz January 6, 2017: 12:02 PM ET See how Amazon packages ship with less than :60 in human hands Did you buy nearly all your presents for the holidays at Amazon? I did. And I must not be alone. Jeff Bezos is the new Santa Claus. But to the rest of retail, Bezos is the evil Krampus that's punishing them all for their naughty behavior. Consider this. Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) is now worth more than these 10 well-known retailers combined: Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS), Sears (SHLD), JCPenney (JCP), Nordstrom (JWN), Best Buy (BBY), Barnes & Noble (BKS), Dillard's (DDS), Gap (GPS) and Target (TGT). In fact, it's not even close. Related: Macy's is closing 68 stores, cutting 1,000 jobs Amazon's market value is just north of $370 billion. These other retailers are collectively worth a little less than $95 billion. And a big chunk of that is from Target, which has a market value of $40 billion. Amazon also is worth significantly more than other global retail giants. Its market value is about $135 billion higher than Alibaba's (BABA, Tech30) and $160 billion more than Walmart (WMT). Amazon is worth more than twice as much as Home Depot (HD), and six times as much as Lowe's (LOW). The company is much more valuable than another famous retailer based in the state of Washington too -- Costco (COST). That warehouse giant, which is increasingly competing with Amazon in the grocery business, is worth about $300 billion less than Amazon. Related: Sears and Kmart closing 150 stores Traditional retailers are doing all they can to compete with Amazon. But it looks like they are going to have to use the old Avis (CAR) rental car motto and try harder. JCPenney joined Macy's and Kohl's Friday morning by reporting disappointing results for the holidays. "Brands like Macy's, Sears, and Kmart are struggling to evolve their brands and stay relevant for today's digitally-savvy and dynamic shopper," said Forrester retail analyst Brendan Witcher. No kidding. And the stock performance of all these retailers clearly show that many retailers are also to struggling to remain relevant with digitally-savvy and dynamic investors as well. Amazon, for better or worse, is the only major retail stock that Wall Street wants to put in its shopping cart.
