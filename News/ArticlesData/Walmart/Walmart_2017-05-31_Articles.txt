Walmart workers to deliver packages on their way home Thu Jun 1st, 2017 4:02pm Business You must sign in or register to continue reading content. Associated Press BENTONVILLE, Ark. — In its latest effort to compete with online giant Amazon, Walmart is testing a delivery service using its own store employees, who will deliver packages ordered online while driving home from their regular work shifts. The “associate delivery” program would use Walmart’s 4,700 U.S. stores and roughly 1.2 million employees to speed delivery and cut costs, the company said Thursday. The announcement came just a day before the company’s annual meeting. The world’s largest retailer said workers can choose to participate and would be paid. The service is being tested at two stores in New Jersey and one in Arkansas. Walmart has stores within 10 miles of 90 percent of the U.S. population, the company said. “Now imagine all the routes our associates drive to and from work and the houses they pass along the way,” Marc Lore, CEO of Walmart’s U.S. online operations, wrote on the company website. Ravi Jariwala, a Walmart spokesman, said all those employees driving home represent a “very dense web” of potential delivery locations for the company. Employees who want to participate will be able to use an app to specify how many packages they are willing to deliver, Jariwala said, as well as the weight and size limits on the packages. Jariwala would not provide details about how workers would be paid, but said the company would comply with all federal and state minimum wage and overtime laws. “This is completely an opt-in program,” he said Thursday. “This is not something they are required to do.” So far, employees “love having the option to earn more cash while doing something that’s already part of their daily routine,” Lore wrote. Some critics of Walmart’s labor practices questioned how voluntary such a program will be. “When so many workers are paid so little that they need government assistance to make ends meet, it becomes a necessity, not a choice, to do what they can to earn more,” said Randy Parraz, director of Making Change at Walmart, a group funded by the United Food and Commercial Workers. The move could result in significant cost savings, though the company didn’t provide estimates of how much. Still, the final delivery step to a customer’s home — what the industry refers to as the “last mile” — “makes up the lion’s share of fulfillment costs,” Jariwala said. The move is the latest step in Walmart’s campaign to counter Amazon’s online dominance. Shoppers on Walmart.com can already choose to pick up items at a nearby store for a lower price. Walmart has also revamped its shipping program and offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase of $35. In its tests so far, Walmart says “many” packages are arriving at customers’ homes just a day after an order has been placed. Participating employees will have to undergo background checks and a check on their driving records, Jariwala said. Faster shipping has become a key area of competition as online retail continues to grow at a double-digit pace, while traditional brick-and-mortar stores struggle with falling sales. Members of Amazon’s $99-a-year Prime service in thousands of areas can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. And in about 30 cities, Prime Now members can get some items in an hour or two. Walmart has previously tested delivery services using Uber drivers. Jariwala said that test is still going on. But Lore noted that the employee delivery service would save a step compared with third-party services that require a driver to travel to a store to pick up a good, then deliver it, then return home. Walmart workers would simply travel from the store they already work at to make the delivery.     Most Read Neighbors worried about development next to former Everett dump EVERETT — Two groups of homeowners are asking the Snohomish County hearing… Jun 3rd, 2017 by Noah Haglund 2 charged after scuffle over stolen meat and a stab in the eye MARYSVILLE — A Snohomish woman was indignant that a grocery store manager… Jun 3rd, 2017 by Diana Hefley Anchor Pub hosts nontraditional church services once a month EVERETT — Their beliefs are traditional, but not much else.

By Abha BhattaraiThe Washington Post Share Comment Read Article Wal-Mart’s newest tactic in its fight against online giant Amazon: Asking its employees to deliver online orders on their way home from work. The idea, Wal-Mart executives said Thursday, is to cut costs on the so-called last-mile of deliveries, when packages are driven to customers’ homes, often the most expensive part of the fulfillment process. Wal-Mart is testing out a new program in two states with the idea of trying to cut costs on the last mile of deliveries. David Leaming /Morning Sentinel Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → “It just makes sense: We already have trucks moving orders from fulfillment centers to stores for pickup,” Marc Lore, chief executive of Wal-Mart’s eCommerce business, and the founder of Jet.com, said in a blog post Thursday. “Those same trucks could be used to bring ship-to-home orders to a store close to their final destination, where a participating associate can sign up to deliver them to the customer’s house.” The company began testing the package-delivery program a month ago in three stores – two in New Jersey, one in northwest Arkansas – but did not offer details on when, or where, it would expand across the United States. Employees will be paid extra, and offered overtime pay as necessary to make the deliveries, Wal-Mart spokesman Ravi Jariwala said Thursday. “Wal-Mart is uniquely qualified, uniquely positioned, to be able to offer this,” he said, adding that 90 percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Wal-Mart store. “There is really strong overlap between where our associates are already heading after work and where those packages need to go.” The company is billing the program as a way for employees to earn extra money, although there were few details on how they would be paid. Jariwala declined to clarify whether employees would be paid based on distance, time, number of deliveries or a combination of those things. Jariwala said Wal-Mart employees have delivered hundreds of packages over the last month, fulfilling orders placed on Jet.com, which Wal-Mart acquired last year, as well as Wal-Mart’s own website. The announcement comes as Wal-Mart doubles down on its online business, where sales grew 63 percent in the first quarter of this year. The company – long the country’s largest retailer – has taken aggressive steps in the past year, beginning with its $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com to compete with Amazon.com, which currently accounts for about 33 percent of the country’s online sales. Wal-Mart has also been rapidly expanding its grocery pickup program, in which shoppers retrieve online orders in the parking lots of a nearby store. More recently, the company has begun offering discounts on certain digital purchases if customers opt to pick them up in-store. Wal-Mart uses its own trucking fleet to deliver packages to stores, tapping into an existing transportation network. A year ago, Wal-Mart announced that it would partner with ride-sharing services such as Uber, Lyft and Deliv to deliver groceries in Phoenix, Denver and Miami. Those efforts are ongoing, Jariwala said. Wal-Mart’s move comes as Amazon continues to build up its transportation and logistics firepower to support speedy delivery. Amazon.com has leased a fleet of 40 cargo jets to bolster its supply chain, and has developed an Amazon-branded trucking fleet. The Seattle-based company has also created Amazon Flex, an on-demand network of drivers, in which the model is similar to Uber or Lyft. The program is voluntary for Wal-Mart employees, Jariwala said, adding that they can sign up for up to 10 deliveries per day using a company app. They can also set size and weight limits on packages. If there are not enough employees to deliver packages, Jariwala said carriers like UPS and FedEx would fill in. “This is completely an opt-in program,” he said. “This is not something associates are required to do. They are, first and foremost, always going to finish their shift.” Share Read or Post Comments Send questions/comments to the editors. Want the news vital to Maine?

The store’s insurer, Ohio Casualty, is demanding that the comic be deposed over the estimated $90 million payout that he received following the deadly 2014 crash that involved him and one of Walmart’s trucks. They are also asking that he turn over his medical records, income statements, information related to his future earning potential — and even documents pertaining to appearances he made on “Saturday Night Live” and the Emmys. Court documents filed last week by Ohio Casualty and Liberty Insurance Underwriters outline the requests for deposition dates for both Morgan and his friend Ardley Fuqua, who was a passenger in the car on the night of the crash. Some of the financial records that they’ve demanded to see include Morgan’s federal and state tax returns from 2009-2014, and documents related to his settlement and prior earnings. In addition, the insurance company has requested to see a list of medicines that he was prescribed after the crash — as well as any records of doctor visits, the Mail reports. To add insult to injury, they’ve asked Morgan to include information pertaining to photos taken of him riding around in a $440,000 Lamborghini just months after the settlement with Walmart. The 48-year-old was said to have suffered a severe brain injury in the July 7, 2014 crash on the New Jersey Turnpike. The incident left his good friend and fellow comic, James McNair, dead and several others seriously injured. Morgan reached his settlement with Walmart in May 2015. He wound up buying a $13.9 million mansion in Alpine, NJ, later that year. Ohio Casualty blasted the deal with Morgan at the time, saying Walmart should have never paid the comedian without putting him or anyone else on the stand. The decision to depose the Bronx native comes a little over a year after he and Fuqua were slapped with subpoenas, ordering them to cough up info about the crash — but they reportedly refused and failed to provide an “adequate excuse” as to why. “The depositions of Morgan and Fuqua are relevant and necessary, because they collectively received 92% of the huge settlement of the Morgan action,” the court documents state. “Their depositions were never taken nor were they served with any formal discovery in the Morgan action, and Wal-Mart [sic] has relied on the claims of Morgan and Fuqua as the principal reason in contending that the settlement of the Morgan action was reasonable.” Walmart’s insurers claim that the rest of the money that the company paid out in crash-related settlements went to McNair’s children. They ultimately believe that Morgan’s potential earnings and financial status weren’t as comprised as he made them out to be, and that he took advantage of the system. The company’s motion to compel depositions of Morgan and Fuqua was filed on May 25 in Trenton, NJ. It asks that they provide a date between June 19 and August 2. The pair could be held in contempt of court if they once again fail to provide a reason for why they can’t testify. “The sole reason Morgan and Fuqua have refused to provide deposition dates is their insistence that Plaintiffs provide information that is not required under the federal rules and accept their unconditional reservation of all rights, including their reservation not to appear for a deposition at all,” Ohio Casualty writes in the court documents. “This is a baseless position designed to avoid giving dates for their depositions,” they said. “For these reasons, Plaintiffs ask that Tracy Morgan and Ardley Fuqua be ordered to each provide Plaintiffs with dates on which they can appear for a 7-hour deposition pursuant to the subpoenas.” Additional reporting by Julia Marsh Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under celebrity lawsuits ,  courts ,  tracy morgan ,  walmart Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Kevin Hart doesn't wear the pants in his marriage Read Next Kevin Hart doesn't wear the pants in his marriage Most Popular This Week 1 Melania Trump's 'revenge' on designers who won't dress her 2 Scott Pelley out of 'CBS Evening News' 3 Kathy Griffin feels 'betrayed' by Anderson Cooper after CNN firing 4 Ariel Winter's beach antics in a thong will make you uncomfortable 5 How Sarah Silverman realized her relationship with Kimmel was over 6 Meet Rickie Fowler's sexy new girlfriend Share Selection Now On Ariana Grande rocks 'One Love Manchester' benefit concert Katie Holmes enrolls at Harvard Business School Rev.

(Photo courtesy of Village of Lincolnwood) Grace Wong, Susan Berger and Brian L. CoxContact ReporterChicago Tribune A teenage girl from Chicago who has been charged with killing an Uber driver randomly attacked the man with a knife and a machete that she had just stolen from Walmart, authorities say. Eliza Wasni, 16, kept her eyes mostly to the floor Wednesday afternoon as a Cook County judge ordered her held without bail in the killing of Grant Nelson of Wilmette — an act prosecutors called "heinous" and "not provoked in any manner." Prosecutors said Nelson, 34, had picked up Wasni early Tuesday a few blocks from a Walmart in Skokie and, minutes into the ride, near the corner of Touhy and Lincoln avenues in Lincolnwood, she began stabbing him. He managed to pull over his Hyundai and run to a nearby condominium building lobby, where he pushed buzzers and yelled, "Help me, help me. I'm going to die," Assistant State's Attorney Michelle Cunningham said. Wasni took off in Nelson's car but quickly struck a median and then ran off on foot, Cunningham said. She was found nearby wearing just a bra and leggings; a bloodstained Chicago Cubs shirt was found nearby, and a trail of blood led responding officers to the condominium lobby and then to the seriously injured Uber driver, Cunningham said.

Assistant State’s Attorney Michelle Cunningham gave a detailed account of the machete and knife attack.

(Chris Walker / Chicago Tribune)  See more videos Police were able to use the Uber app on his phone to see that "Eliza" was the name of his most recent customer, the prosecutor said. She called Nelson a "random victim." Nelson, who attended New Trier High School in Winnetka and the University of Colorado at Boulder, described his attacker to police but died later at a nearby hospital, officials said. Surveillance footage from Walmart showed Wasni walking around the store with a knife and machete and then leaving without paying for them, the prosecutor said. She said Wasni had taken two earlier Uber rides the evening before, including one to Des Plaines and another from Des Plaines to Walmart. She was apparently in violation of the ride-sharing company's terms and conditions, which say customers must be at least 18 years old. Wasni spoke during the bond court hearing only to confirm her name. Her lawyer, a public defender, said the teen attends Taft High School in Chicago and lives with a single mother. Wasni has been charged as an adult with first-degree murder. Judge Michael Hood ordered her to be held without bail and called the crime "extremely violent." An official with the Cook County sheriff's office said Wasni will be held in a juvenile facility. Outside the courtroom, Nelson's brother, Todd Nelson, called him "the most gentle, kind person. He never hurt anyone. He was good to animals, he was good to children."

Grant Nelson, shown in a family photo, was working for Uber when he was fatally stabbed while dropping off a passenger in Lincolnwood, according to police. (Todd Nelson photo) Grant Nelson, his brother said, loved opera and classical piano and was a "very good" piano player. He had also previously worked at Di Pescara restaurant in Northbrook, a manager there confirmed. "He was just trying to do the best he could in life," Todd Nelson said. His sister, Alexandra Nelson, added that the family hopes "justice will happen," calling the attack "horrifying and maddening." The siblings, as well as their parents, were in the courtroom during the hearing. Alexandra Nelson sat behind her father with her hand on his shoulder as a description of the alleged crime was read by the prosecutor. Family members sobbed at times during the proceedings, including when officials described Grant Nelson begging for help in the lobby before he was found on the ground outside in a pool of blood with multiple stab wounds on his right side. An Uber spokeswoman issued a statement Wednesday saying the company is "heartbroken by the loss of one of our partners, Grant Nelson. Our deepest sympathies and prayers are with his family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time." Regarding the company's 18-and-older age restriction for customers, the spokeswoman later explained that a rider's access to the service can be removed if the rider is found to be underage, and that there is a mechanism for drivers to report riders if they suspect them of being younger than 18. The spokeswoman said Uber has safety tips for drivers and riders, developed with the assistance of law enforcement agencies. She also said that drivers are encouraged to contact local authorities if they ever feel unsafe, and that the app has a two-way feedback system that is monitored around the clock by a team that investigates any problems that are reported.

Roston - Jun 1, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Walmart has revealed the latest method it is using to train store employees: virtual reality. The big-box retailer got the idea from observing football players using VR to train, and it has since implemented the technology into 30 of its ‘Walmart Academy’ training centers. The idea behind the training method is to introduce future employees and managers to situations they will encounter during the course of their job, but that they would benefit from experiencing ahead of time in a safe environment. The retailer uses Black Friday as an example, explaining that a manager-in-training who has never worked on a Black Friday can experience what it is like via virtual reality. ‘Wouldn’t it be helpful to understand the dynamics of such a busy day,’ the retailer asks, ‘before you ever had to actually manage your associates and customers through it?’ The Walmart VR experience puts trainees into a ‘lifelike’ environment that mimics an actual Walmart store. The training has proven more effective than real-life training situations, according to the company, which has spurred it to expand the training method’s implementation. Walmart says it will roll out VR training to all of its Walmart Academy facilities (200 of them) by the end of this year. Virtual reality is increasingly making its way into various facilities and usage scenarios beyond the scope of consumer gameplay. Hospitals, for example, has started testing the technology as a pain management tool, essentially using the headsets as a way to distract patients from pain that may otherwise require painkillers.

Press enter to search Do You Want Walmart Associates Knocking On Your Door? By Jamie Grill-Goodman - 06/01/2017 Do You Want Walmart Associates Knocking On Your Door? Walmart seeks to answer this question with a new pilot. The mega retailer is now using store employees to deliver packages to customers' homes, starting with three test stores – two in New Jersey and one in northwest Arkansas. "Not only can this cut shipping costs and get packages to their final destinations faster and more efficiently, it creates a special win-win-win for customers, associates and the business," Marc Lore, President and CEO, Walmart U.S. eCommerce, writes in a blog post. Here's how it wokrs: trucks moving orders from fulfillment centers to stores for pickup will be used to bring ship-to-home orders to a store close to their final destination, where associates can sign up to deliver them to the customer’s house. The plan gives associates a way to earn extra income on their existing drive home. Employees that opt in can set preferences in the Tech Walmart has developed for this. They can choose how many packages they can deliver, the size and weight limits of those packages and which days they’re able to make deliveries after work. Once they’re done working at the store for the day, they pick up the packages from the backroom, load them into their vehicle, enter the delivery addresses into the GPS on their phone and head toward home. "Many orders are being delivered the next day, and associates love having the option to earn more cash while doing something that’s already part of their daily routine," writes Lore. "An unexpected benefit is they’re finding quicker routes home thanks to the GPS built into our proprietary app." As retailers scramble to compete with Amazon, is this type of last-mile innovation the answer? Maybe. So far Lore says "the response from associates and customers has been great."

Walmart is testing a delivery service using its own store employees, who will deliver packages ordered online while driving home from their regular work shifts. The world's largest retailer says workers can choose to participate and would be paid. The service is being tested at two stores in New Jersey and one in Arkansas. (AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez, File) Print Email The Washington Post By The Washington Post The Times-Picayune Follow on Twitter on June 01, 2017 at 4:44 PM, updated June 01, 2017 at 4:45 PM comments BENTONVILLE, ARK. - Walmart's newest tactic in its fight against online giant Amazon: Asking its employees to deliver online orders on their way home from work. The idea, Walmart executives said Thursday, is to cut costs on the so-called last-mile of deliveries, when packages are driven to customers' homes, often the most expensive part of the fulfillment process. "It just makes sense: We already have trucks moving orders from fulfillment centers to stores for pickup," Marc Lore, chief executive of Walmart's eCommerce business, and the founder of Jet.com, said in a blog post Thursday afternoon. "Those same trucks could be used to bring ship-to-home orders to a store close to their final destination, where a participating associate can sign up to deliver them to the customer's house." The company began testing the package-delivery program a month ago in three stores - two in New Jersey, one in northwest Arkansas - but did not offer details on when, or where, it would expand across the United States. Employees will be paid extra, and offered overtime pay as necessary to make the deliveries, Walmart spokesman Ravi Jariwala said Thursday. "Walmart is uniquely qualified, uniquely positioned, to be able to offer this," he said, adding that 90 percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store. "There is really strong overlap between where are associates are already heading after work and where those packages need to go." The company is billing the program as a way for employees to earn extra money, although there were few details on how they would be paid. Jariwala declined to clarify whether employees would be paid based on distance, time, number of deliveries or a combination of those things. Labor experts say the arrangement, a mash-up of sorts between an Uber-style gig economy and traditional employment arrangements, raises a number of questions related to employees having to shoulder much of the risk, cost and liability associated with deliveries. "The practice seems ripe for abuse if the company does not compensate workers for the full cost of their journey, the expenses related to gas, car depreciation, and potential problems like accidents, tickets or parking expenses," said Stephanie Luce, a labor professor at the City University of New York. "Like other 'gig economy' type jobs, there is a potential to benefit workers - but in reality, most of the benefits accrue to the employer, not the employee." Earlier this year, Walmart - which last year reported $485.9 billion in revenue - said it would raise its hourly minimum wage to $10 for most workers, but activist groups say many employees are still struggling to make ends meet. "Instead of Walmart paying its workers what they deserve for their work, Walmart is merely offering to pay more - for more work," said Randy Parraz, director of Making Change at Walmart, a campaign run by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. "To say this is a voluntary program is like throwing a life preserver to someone drowning in a lake," he added. "When so many workers are paid so little that they need government assistance to make ends meet, it becomes a necessity, not a choice, to do what they can to earn more." Some Walmart employees were also skeptical of the arrangement, particularly given the lack of specifics. "Without understanding if associates are going to be compensated for gas, additional insurance costs, wear and tear on our cars and the potential risks of delivering packages, this program could be creating problems for associates," said Cynthia Murray, a Walmart employee in Laurel, Maryland, who leads the Organization United for Respect Walmart, a workers' activist group. "While Walmart continues to point to its 1.5 million associates as its advantage over companies like Amazon, we also know that they are not doing enough to support us and our families." This isn't the first time Walmart has enlisted others to deliver its goods. Four years ago, executives told Reuters they were toying with the idea of having customers deliver packages to online shoppers in exchange for a discount. The company also partners with ride-sharing services like Uber, Lyft and Deliv to deliver groceries in Phoenix, Denver and Miami. "We think crowdsourcing is a mechanism of the future, and frankly, as you think about the move to driverless [vehicles], that could also make the cost of delivery lower," Scott Price, chief administrative officer of Walmart International, said Thursday. "The inefficiency of delivery can destroy profitability." Thursday's announcement comes as Walmart doubles down on its online business, where sales grew 63 percent in the first quarter of this year. The company - long the country's largest retailer - has taken aggressive steps in the past year, beginning with its $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com to compete with Amazon.com, which accounts for about 33 percent of the country's online sales. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) Walmart has also been rapidly expanding its grocery pickup program, in which shoppers retrieve online orders in the parking lots of a nearby store. More recently, the company has begun offering discounts on certain digital purchases if customers opt to pick them up in-store. In that model, Walmart uses its own trucking fleet to deliver packages to stores, tapping into an existing transportation network. Amazon.com is also making similar efforts to speed up delivery. The Seattle-based company in recent months has leased a fleet of 40 cargo jets, and has developed an Amazon-branded trucking fleet. It also created Amazon Flex, an on-demand network of drivers, similar to Uber or Lyft. Walmart employees, he added, have delivered hundreds of packages during the past month, fulfilling orders placed on Jet.com, which Walmart acquired last year, as well as Walmart's own website. Walmart employees can sign up for up to 10 deliveries per day using a company app, Jariwala said. They can also set size and weight limits on packages. If there are not enough employees to deliver packages, carriers like UPS and FedEx would fill in. "This is completely an opt-in program," he said. "This is not something associates are required to do. They are, first and foremost, always going to finish their shift." - - - Author Information: Abha Bhattarai is a business reporter for The Washington Post.

RUGABER, AP Economics Writer BENTONVILLE, Ark. — In its latest effort to compete with online giant Amazon, Walmart is testing a delivery service using its own store employees, who will deliver packages ordered online while driving home from their regular work shifts. The "associate delivery" program would use Walmart's 4,700 U.S. stores and roughly 1.2 million employees to speed delivery and cut costs, the company said Thursday. The announcement came just a day before the company's annual meeting. The world's largest retailer says workers can choose to participate and would be paid. The service is being tested at two stores in New Jersey and one in Arkansas. Walmart has stores within 10 miles of 90 percent of the U.S. population, the company says. "Now imagine all the routes our associates drive to and from work and the houses they pass along the way," Marc Lore, CEO of Walmart's U.S. online operations, wrote on the company website. Ravi Jariwala, a Walmart spokesman, said all those employees driving home represent a "very dense web" of potential delivery locations for the company. Employees who want to participate will be able to use an app to specify how many packages they are willing to deliver, Jariwala said, as well as the weight and size limits on the packages. Jariwala would not provide details about how workers would be paid, but said the company would comply with all federal and state minimum wage and overtime laws. "This is completely an opt-in program," he said Thursday. "This is not something they are required to do." So far, employees "love having the option to earn more cash while doing something that's already part of their daily routine," Lore wrote. Some critics of Walmart's labor practices questioned how voluntary such a program will be. "When so many workers are paid so little that they need government assistance to make ends meet, it becomes a necessity, not a choice, to do what they can to earn more," said Randy Parraz, director of Making Change at Walmart, a group funded by the United Food and Commercial Workers. The move could result in significant cost savings, though the company didn't provide estimates of how much. Still, the final delivery step to a customer's home — what the industry refers to as the "last mile" — "makes up the lion's share of fulfillment costs," Jariwala said. The move is the latest step in Walmart's campaign to counter Amazon's online dominance. Shoppers on Walmart.com can already choose to pick up items at a nearby store for a lower price. Walmart has also revamped its shipping program and offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase of $35. In its tests so far, Walmart says "many" packages are arriving at customers' homes just a day after an order has been placed. Participating employees will have to undergo background checks and a check on their driving records, Jariwala said. Faster shipping has become a key area of competition as online retail continues to grow at a double-digit pace, while traditional brick-and-mortar stores struggle with falling sales. Members of Amazon's $99-a-year Prime service in thousands of areas can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. And in about 30 cities, Prime Now members can get some items in an hour or two. Walmart has previously tested delivery services using Uber drivers. Jariwala said that test is still going on. But Lore noted that the employee delivery service would save a step compared with third-party services that require a driver to travel to a store to pick up a good, then deliver it, then return home. Walmart workers would simply travel from the store they already work at to make the delivery. Copyright 2017 by The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

By Associated Press Jun 1st, 2017 203 BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) — In its latest effort to compete with online giant Amazon, Walmart is testing a delivery service using its own store employees, who will deliver packages ordered online while driving home from their regular work shifts. The “associate delivery” program would use Walmart’s 4,700 U.S. stores and roughly 1.2 million employees to speed delivery and cut costs, the company said Thursday. The announcement came just a day before the company’s annual meeting. The world’s largest retailer says workers can choose to participate and would be paid. The service is being tested at two stores in New Jersey and one in Arkansas. Walmart has stores within 10 miles of 90 percent of the U.S. population, the company says. “Now imagine all the routes our associates drive to and from work and the houses they pass along the way,” Marc Lore, CEO of Walmart’s U.S. online operations, wrote on the company website. Ravi Jariwala, a Walmart spokesman, said all those employees driving home represent a “very dense web” of potential delivery locations for the company. Employees who want to participate will be able to use an app to specify how many packages they are willing to deliver, Jariwala said, as well as the weight and size limits on the packages. Jariwala would not provide details about how workers would be paid, but said the company would comply with all federal and state minimum wage and overtime laws. “This is completely an opt-in program,” he said Thursday. “This is not something they are required to do.” So far, employees “love having the option to earn more cash while doing something that’s already part of their daily routine,” Lore wrote. Some critics of Walmart’s labor practices questioned how voluntary such a program will be. “When so many workers are paid so little that they need government assistance to make ends meet, it becomes a necessity, not a choice, to do what they can to earn more,” said Randy Parraz, director of Making Change at Walmart, a group funded by the United Food and Commercial Workers. The move could result in significant cost savings, though the company didn’t provide estimates of how much. Still, the final delivery step to a customer’s home — what the industry refers to as the “last mile” — “makes up the lion’s share of fulfillment costs,” Jariwala said. The move is the latest step in Walmart’s campaign to counter Amazon’s online dominance. Shoppers on Walmart.com can already choose to pick up items at a nearby store for a lower price. Walmart has also revamped its shipping program and offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase of $35. In its tests so far, Walmart says “many” packages are arriving at customers’ homes just a day after an order has been placed. Participating employees will have to undergo background checks and a check on their driving records, Jariwala said. Faster shipping has become a key area of competition as online retail continues to grow at a double-digit pace, while traditional brick-and-mortar stores struggle with falling sales. Members of Amazon’s $99-a-year Prime service in thousands of areas can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location.

"Following" : "Follow"}} June 01, 2017 4:11pm   Comments Share: Related WMT Fast Money Picks For June 2 The Retail Demise: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly Foreign Stocks Look Attractive To Mutual Fund Managers (Investor's Business Daily) Why is Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT), the world's biggest retailer, getting itself involved with the same virtual reality technology used by professional athletes? Wal-Mart announced it will begin using STRIVR Lab's virtual reality technologies to train employees at each of its 200 "Wal-Mart Academy" facilities. An estimated 150,000 new workers will be trained in topics including management and customer service. Innovative Technology As A Teacher Derek Belch, STRIVR's founder and CEO, was a guest on CNBC to explain what some might find a confusing relationship. Wal-Mart's virtual reality technologies will simulate experiences and decision-making scenarios that employees would face on a daily basis, Belch said. After all, practice makes perfect, whether it's throwing a touchdown pass or dealing with some of the everyday problems a Wal-Mart shopper faces. "At the most basic level it is that simple — how do you simulate and give more repetitions to employees of all levels at all Wal-Mart stores?" he said.  Perhaps most important, a virtual reality course offers employees the necessary experience and know-how to tackle a problem that might occur just once a year, but have a high ROI impact. Black Friday is a once-a-year event and, by Belch's estimates, half of all managers have never dealt with a holiday rush. Belch's platform allows managers to be better prepared to deal with surges in foot traffic and to offer guests a better experience on such a hectic day, he said.  Related Links: How Empathy Will Save Brick-And-Mortar Retail The Holiday Season Has Been Kind To Discount Retailers, Not So Much Toward Department Stores Latest Ratings for WMT Date Firm Action From To May 2017 BMO Capital Upgrades Underperform Market Perform May 2017 Gordon Haskett Initiates Coverage On Buy Apr 2017 Telsey Advisory Group Upgrades Market Perform Outperform View More Analyst Ratings for WMT View the Latest Analyst Ratings Posted-In: Analyst Color CNBC Sports Top Stories Analyst Ratings Tech Media Trading Ideas Best of Benzinga © 2017 Benzinga.com.

By Jackie Wattles NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- "Since it's on your way, can you drop this off?" That's essentially what Walmart is asking some store workers to do. More specifically, the retailer is testing out the concept of having employees deliver packages to customers' homes on their commute home. In a blog post published Thursday, Walmart touted the idea as a way to both speed up its delivery service and help employees make a little extra money Two stores in New Jersey and one in Arkansas have been trying it out over the past month, and Walmart insists "the response from associates and customers has been great." It's not clear when or if the program will expand. The company says it's developed an app that allows employees to sign up for the program, and that participation is optional. The app can alert an associate when there's an order destined for a location that's on his or her way home. The company says "many" orders delivered in the testing program wind up arriving the day after they're placed. By comparison, Amazon has rolled out same-day delivery services across much of the country. Walmart's program is a sign that it's looking to compete. "It just makes sense," the company said in the blog post. "Walmart has strength in numbers with 4,700 stores across the U.S. and more than a million associates. Our stores put us within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population." The company declined to say how much employees are paid to take on the added responsibility -- but Walmart did say that workers are "fully in control of their experience." "Associates choose how many packages they can deliver, the size and weight limits of those packages, and which days they're able to make deliveries after work," the blog post says. "It's completely up to them, and they can update those preferences at any time." TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Walmart Employees Now Delivering Packages To Your Front Door Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Employees Now Delivering Packages To Your Front Door June 1, 2017 3:34 pm EDT By Ashlee Kieler@akieler on your way home walmart retail delivery big box store online orders SHIPPING e-commerce Two-day free shipping, online pickup discounts, grocery pickup — these are just a few ways in which Walmart has tried to up its online shopping game while staying competitive with rival Amazon. Today, the big box retailer rolled out its latest effort: sending associates to customers’ houses with orders in hand.  Walmart announced today that is testing a system at three stores in New Jersey and Arkansas in which local store associates can earn extra funds by delivering customers’ online orders. The new “last-mile” system is intended to cut shipping costs and get packages to their final destinations faster and more efficiently, while creating a “special win-win-win” for all involved, Walmart e-commerce CEO Marc Lore wrote in a blog post. Through the new system, store associates can sign up to deliver products to customers’ homes at the end of their shifts. Once the worker’s shift is over for the day, they take the packages and drop them off to customers who happen to be on their route home. It’s unclear what the timeframe between customers placing an orders and receiving it will be. We’ve reached out to Walmart for additional details. Associates who opt in to participate in the delivery system will be able to choose the number of deliveries to make, along with the size and weight of those packages. Lore says the new offering makes sense for the retailer given its fulfillment fleet and the millions of associates working in stores. “We already have trucks moving orders from fulfillment centers to stores for pickup,” he wrote. “Those same trucks could be used to bring ship-to-home orders to a store close to their final destination.” Additionally, with more than 4,000 stores, that final destination is likely within 10 miles of most customers, Lore notes. Lore says the company will likely use the system to create even more last-mile delivery innovations in the future, such as providing same-day delivery — think Amazon Prime Now — to some customers.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    In its latest effort to compete with online giant Amazon, Walmart is testing a delivery service using its own store employees, who will deliver packages ordered online while driving home from their regular work shifts. The "associate delivery" program would use Walmart's 4,700 U.S. stores and roughly 1.2 million employees to speed delivery and cut costs. The world's largest retailer says workers can choose to participate and would be paid. The service is being tested at two stores in New Jersey and one in Arkansas. Walmart has stores within 10 miles of 90 percent of the U.S. population, the company says. "Now imagine all the routes our associates drive to and from work and the houses they pass along the way," Marc Lore, CEO of Walmart's U.S. online operations, wrote on the company website. Ravi Jariwala, a Walmart spokesman, said all those employees driving home represent a "very dense web" of potential delivery locations for the company. Employees who want to participate will be able to use an app to specify how many packages they are willing to deliver, Jariwala said, as well as the weight and size limits on the packages. Jariwala would not provide details about how workers would be paid, but said the company would comply with all federal and state minimum wage and overtime laws. "This is completely an opt-in program," he said Thursday. "This is not something they are required to do." So far, employees "love having the option to earn more cash while doing something that's already part of their daily routine," Lore wrote. The move could result in significant cost savings, though the company didn't provide estimates of how much. Still, the final delivery step to a customer's home — what the industry refers to as the "last mile" — "makes up the lion's share of fulfillment costs," Jariwala said. The move is the latest step in Walmart's campaign to counter Amazon's online dominance. Shoppers on Walmart.com can already choose to pick up items at a nearby store for a lower price. Walmart has also revamped its shipping program and offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase of $35. In its tests so far, Walmart says "many" packages are arriving at customers' homes just a day after an order has been placed. Participating employees will have to undergo background checks and will need clean driving records, Jariwala said. Faster shipping has become a key area of competition as online retail continues to grow at a double-digit pace, while traditional brick-and-mortar stores struggle with falling sales. Members of Amazon's $99-a-year Prime service in thousands of areas can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. And in about 30 cities, Prime Now members can get some items in an hour or two. Walmart has previously tested delivery services using Uber drivers. Jariwala said that test is still going on. © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Source: Shutterstock Walmart has reached an agreement with virtual reality startup STRIVR Labs to have it supply it with experiences to train its employees. This includes lessons and training material for customer service, manager and other positions. The virtual reality training sessions will be viewed via Facebook Inc’s (NASDAQ:FB) Oculus Rift headsets. Walmart will be adding a single headset to each of its 200 training centers in the United States by the end of this year. Having the virtual reality headsets at its training centers in the United States will give 150,000 employees access to them. The headsets will offering training materials that will last between 30 seconds and five minutes. These virtual reality experiences are meant to be used in addition to other training materials, reports Tech Crunch. Walmart’s decision to use virtual reality to train its employees shows that the technology can be used for more than just entertainment. This is something that virtual reality companies are going to want to keep in mind as the technology continues to become more prevalent. While virtual reality continues to grow, there is one thing that could hold the technology back: sickness. There have been several cases of virtual reality making people vomit and it is never a good sign when a product makes a customer ill.

RUGABER BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) — In its latest effort to compete with online giant Amazon, Walmart is testing a delivery service using its own store employees, who will deliver packages ordered online while driving home from their regular work shifts. The “associate delivery” program would use Walmart’s 4,700 U.S. stores and roughly 1.2 million employees to speed delivery and cut costs. The world’s largest retailer says workers can choose to participate and would be paid. The service is being tested at two stores in New Jersey and one in Arkansas. Walmart has stores within 10 miles of 90 percent of the U.S. population, the company says. “Now imagine all the routes our associates drive to and from work and the houses they pass along the way,” Marc Lore, CEO of Walmart’s U.S. online operations, wrote on the company website. Ravi Jariwala, a Walmart spokesman, said all those employees driving home represent a “very dense web” of potential delivery locations for the company. Employees who want to participate will be able to use an app to specify how many packages they are willing to deliver, Jariwala said, as well as the weight and size limits on the packages. Jariwala would not provide details about how workers would be paid, but said the company would comply with all federal and state minimum wage and overtime laws. “This is completely an opt-in program,” he said Thursday. “This is not something they are required to do.” So far, employees “love having the option to earn more cash while doing something that’s already part of their daily routine,” Lore wrote. The move could result in significant cost savings, though the company didn’t provide estimates of how much. Still, the final delivery step to a customer’s home — what the industry refers to as the “last mile” — “makes up the lion’s share of fulfillment costs,” Jariwala said. The move is the latest step in Walmart’s campaign to counter Amazon’s online dominance. Shoppers on Walmart.com can already choose to pick up items at a nearby store for a lower price. Walmart has also revamped its shipping program and offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase of $35. In its tests so far, Walmart says “many” packages are arriving at customers’ homes just a day after an order has been placed. Participating employees will have to undergo background checks and will need clean driving records, Jariwala said. Faster shipping has become a key area of competition as online retail continues to grow at a double-digit pace, while traditional brick-and-mortar stores struggle with falling sales. Members of Amazon’s $99-a-year Prime service in thousands of areas can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. And in about 30 cities, Prime Now members can get some items in an hour or two. Walmart has previously tested delivery services using Uber drivers. Jariwala said that test is still going on.

Tech Apple Science Cars Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 WWDC 2017 E3 2017 Prime Day 2017     Nintendo Switch Stock Tracking Report For June 1 Posted: Jun 1 2017, 1:44pm CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Jun 1 2017, 2:03pm CDT, in News | Technology News     This is the Nintendo Switch stock tracking report for online and in store availability for Thursday, June 1. June kicks off with new Nintendo Switch stock at gamestop.com. The video game retailer is offering five new Nintendo Switch bundles starting under $400. The shipping time is as expected on the ARMS release date.  Don't Miss: Find Rare Products in Stock Online with The Tracker It would makes sense to offer a Nintendo Switch ARMS bundle, but GameStop sticks to Zelda and Mario Kart for the bundles. GameStop sold a new bundle late Wednesday online at gamestop.com, but now appears to have secured a new major shipment with June 16 delivery.  The Nintendo Switch availability is also very low at retail locations. Another way to get the Nintendo Switch is via the Pepsi Fire Summer Sweepstake. Pepsi gives away 200 Nintendo Switch bundles in the next weeks. The reason for the low supply is the likely upcoming E3 2017 video game conference and the release of Arms on June 16. Nintendo will want to have the Switch in stock for the video game show when the buzz hits a new high. The only way to get a Nintendo Switch online now is at reseller market places like Amazon. The Nintendo Switch reseller markups keep steady and range today between $88 to $110 for the Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and $95 to $130 for the Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con on amazon.com. The Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con is more rare than the console with Gray controllers, resulting in considerable higher market value. Overall the Nintendo Switch market prices have staid flat. Read the reseller offers carefully and check the feedback. Some low priced offers have shipping dates in July. Walmart for the first time in the past two months has not sold the Nintendo Switch online in a bundle on Friday at 5pm ET. The retailer finally reacts to the over selling problem. Our Nintendo Switch order from last Friday got put on backorder days after the order was placed. Walmart has finally shipped our Nintendo Switch console we ordered as part of a bundle on May 19. It is scheduled to arrive on June 1. Our Nintendo Switch Giveaway will launch soon after we received the Switch in the office. This could mean that Walmart is able to offer limited Nintendo Switch inventory again on walmart.com this Friday at 5pm ET. To find Nintendo Switch in stock online, shoppers can use our new The Tracker app, available as free download for iOS and Android. Further below this report features the latest on the in-store availability of the Nintendo Switch.  Nintendo believes the Nintendo Switch will be as big as the extremely successful Nintendo Wii. Looking at the current shortage, the Japanese video game maker has a long road ahead of them to ship 101 million Nintendo Switch consoles. The positive reception and praise of the Nintendo Switch fuel the demand for the mobile and home console hybrid. Nintendo is also busy marketing the Nintendo Switch with hands-on events and at the E3 2017. Find below the latest Nintendo Switch online availability updates and stock tracking updates for stores. Nintendo Switch Stock at Online Stores There are no options to buy the Nintendo Switch online today. GameStop runs a big video game accessories sale, including discounts of 20% on select Switch accessories. Amazon restocked the Nintendo Switch the last time two weeks ago. Only Prime members got access to the Nintendo Switch stock. When the next Switch sale on Amazon takes place is not known. Use our new Tracker app to get notified when the Switch is in stock at Amazon or other major online retailer. The app is set and forget. When there is a Switch in stock you will receive a notification in real-time on your iPhone or Android phone. The Nintendo Switch will continue to be hard to find for the foreseeable future. Nintendo plans to ship 10 million consoles world-wide in the time from April 2017 to April 2018. From the launch on Mach 3 to April 27, the Mario company sold 2.74 million Switch consoles. The Nintendo Switch reseller markups keep steady and range today between $88 to $110 for the Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and $95 to $130 for the Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con on amazon.com. The Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con is more rare than the console with Gray controllers, resulting in considerable higher market value. Overall the Nintendo Switch market prices have risen slightly. To find Nintendo Switch in stock online, shoppers can use our new The Tracker app, available as free download for iOS and Android.  There are also several new accessories coming on the market from Nintendo in the next weeks. See the full list of new Nintendo Switch accessories. When is Nintendo Switch in stock online again? Nintendo is ramping up the production for the Nintendo Switch, but has not disclosed what the current production capacity per month is. The demand for the Nintendo Switch will spike during the Holiday Shopping season 2017. Nintendo will set aside a large part of the Switch production during the next months for November and December. This stock piling will keep the Nintendo Switch in short supply during the next 5 months. As Nintendo coordinated new Switch console shipment with the launch of Mario Kart 8, we expect the company to do the same for the next major Switch game launches. This means the next big wave of new Switch consoles comes in mid-June for the release of ARMS. The Nintendo Switch will likely be offered in special bundles in time for the Holidays. A Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Switch bundle has already surfaced in Russia. Because of the incredible demand for the Switch console, the monetary savings on these bundles will be limited. Usually bundles offer a way for consumers to get a free game. Nintendo can afford to just offer some savings, unless the demand is slowing down. Read the latest Nintendo Switch news. How to find a Nintendo Switch in Stock Online We developed the The Tracker app to make finding stock of rare products online as easy and stress free as possible. Download the free app for Apple iPhone or Android phones. From the list products you select to be notified for the Switch with Grey Joy-Con and/or Neon Joy-Con. That is it. It is set and forget. At the moment we detect the Nintendo Switch console in stock at major online retailers, you receive a notification on your smartphone. Now you are just a tap away from buying a Nintendo Switch. You can also see the current availability of the Nintendo Switch consoles in the web version of The Tracker: Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con, Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con. Nintendo Switch in Stock at Stores Best Buy stores had the Nintendo Switch in stock this morning. We prepared our readers for this Switch event before it was official. The Nintendo Switch is also available in 589 Walmart stores, 62 Target stores, 31 GameStop locations according to the Nintendo Switch inventory tracker iStockNow (2:30pm ET).  Number of reported stores contineus dropping, indicating that no new inventory is arriving. The Nintendo flagship store in New York said on April 28 in a tweet to have the Nintendo Switch in stock each morning. People in New York or visitors can give this purchase option a try. Social media posts from people who visited the flagship store confirm the availability of the Switch at the Nintendo store in New York. Some even report that they saw the Switch still on the shelves late afternoon. The Nintendo store is apparently consistently stocking the Switch each day. This week two new Switch games are released. The big upcoming Switch games are Arms on June 16 and Splatoon 2 on July 21. Amazon offers pre-order discounts on both of the titles for Prime members to the tune of 20%.

By Doug G. Ware   |   June 1, 2017 at 3:09 PM Follow @upi Comments June 1 (UPI) -- National discount retailer Walmart is testing home delivery service in three U.S. markets through a mobile phone application that matches customers' addresses with employees' commutes. In a blog post Thursday, Walmart e-commerce CEO Marc Lore said employees at three stores -- two in New Jersey and one in Arkansas -- are participating on a volunteer basis to deliver ordered items to customers whose residences are located close to their route home. "Our latest test is taking [customer service] another step further and leveraging one of our greatest assets -- our associates -- to get online orders to customers' doors," Lore wrote. "Not only can this cut shipping costs and get packages to their final destinations faster and more efficiently, it creates a special win-win-win for customers, associates and the business." The home delivery test also serves shoppers of Jet.com, an e-commerce company founded by Lore and acquired by Walmart last year. The new effort is the latest in a series of new concepts the retailer has introduced recently. Lore cited online grocery pickup, two-day free shipping and store pickup discounts as other measures designed to upgrade customers' experience in shopping on Walmart.com. "It just makes sense: We already have trucks moving orders from fulfillment centers to stores for pickup. Those same trucks could be used to bring ship-to-home orders to a store close to their final destination, where a participating associate can sign up to deliver them to the customer's house," he added. "The best part is this gives our own associates a way to earn extra income on their existing drive home." Willing employees in New Jersey and Arkansas choose the number and size of packages they are able to deliver on their route home. If the new delivery strategy succeeds, Walmart expects to expand it to other stores throughout the country. RELATEDWalmart online sales jump 63% in first quarter Online sales at Walmart.com increased by more than 60 percent during the first quarter of 2017 as the retailer continues to grow its focus on web sales. "It's easy to see why this test could be a game-changer," Lore said. Arkansas-based Walmart is one of the largest retail employers in the United States -- with 4,700 stores and 1.3 million employees. Lore said the chain's numerous locations places it within a 10-mile reach of 90 percent of the U.S. population.

It's old hat. It's not nearly gold enough. What you need, friend, is a gold PlayStation 4.  View photos PlayStation 4 (Gold)More (Reddit user "Christopher_Maxim") And it looks like that's exactly what you're gonna get!  At least that's what you're going to get if you choose to buy the upcoming gold-colored PlayStation 4 console that Sony's planning for release. The console hasn't been officially announced by Sony, but one popped up recently at a Walmart retail location. The photo above was snapped by Reddit user "Christopher_Maxim," who spotted the gold PS4 on display his local Walmart and proceeded to attempt buying it. Here's what he says happened: "This Walmart put them out early. [The] register locked up when I tried to buy one, and the staff realized their mistake. I snagged a pic before they brought them out back." View photos PlayStation 4 SlimMore (The gold PS4 above is a version of the PlayStation 4 "Slim" model that Sony released in late 2016.Sony) Here's hoping the gold PS4 wasn't summarily executed "out back" — more likely it was just taken out of public view. Maxim also says that, when the manager arrived to figure out the issue with the register, they realized the console was accidentally up for sale early — before Sony even announced the system. "The woman at the counter wanted to sell it to me," Maxim says. "But the manager she called over said that it was out way too early and the store would get fined if they sold it." From the looks of the box, the gold PlayStation 4 will cost $249 and it comes with a 1TB hard drive (a step up over the traditional 500GB PlayStation 4). Sony has yet to comment on the leak; we expect the console to be announced at the annual game industry trade show, E3, during the week of June 13.

(file photo) Walmart is expected to bring in more than 500 jobs with the opening of a new distribution center in Mobile, County, Ala. (file photo) By John Sharp jsharp@al.com The humble beginnings of what will blossom into a mega-distribution center are beginning to take shape on west Mobile County farmland. At the non-descript site off Interstate 10 are dozens of pickup trucks, makeshift trailers and construction machines. The only symbol that this rural tract will become home to one of Walmart's biggest investments along the Gulf Coast is a simple sign that reads, "Coming Spring 2018. Walmart." "I drive out and look at the site periodically," said Troy Wayman, vice president of economic development with the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce. "It's kind of like your baby. You want to look as often as possible. It's phenomenal to see." This is the only clue in rural Mobile County, Ala., that a mega Walmart distribution center will be operational this time next year. Construction is underway at the site where a 2.5 million square foot facility will service the nearby Port of Mobile. (John Sharp/jsharp@al.com).  The world's No. 1 retailer remains on schedule with the construction of a $135 million, 2.5-million-square-foot distribution center that is expected to bolster activity at the nearby Port of Mobile and substantially increase truck traffic on I-10. According to a Walmart spokeswoman, the construction timeline remains unchanged, and the distribution center will be fully operational by this time next year. Walmart will begin posting for senior-level positions, such as operations managers and area managers, starting this month or in early July. The hope, the company says, is to have a leadership team hired by the fall. Once the center is built, Walmart plans to add 550 jobs to support the logistical hub that will serve 800 of Walmart's 4,600 U.S. stores. Those 800 stores are scattered over a sweeping area of the nation's heartland, from Alabama to Mississippi northward to the Great Lakes region. The company broke ground on the project in March. City, county and state taxpayers are investing in the project by providing incentives totaling about $15.3 million in property and sales tax abatements and up to $6.5 million in land purchase and road improvements. "We're just excited about how the project is progressing," Wayman said. The ongoing work on the distribution center - which will rank in the top 10 percent of the company's U.S. facilities in scope and size, and will be the company's sixth import distribution center in the U.S. - comes as Walmart is pushing forward on retail store and training expansions in Alabama. The company, in a news release last month, announced a multimillion-dollar capital campaign to remodel seven locations in the state: Mobile, Tuscaloosa, Brewton, Enterprise, Northport, Alexander City and Guntersville. In addition, the company is launching more of its Walmart academies. Presently, there are three such academies in the state, at Wetumpka, Fairhope and Gadsden. Erica Jones, senior manager with Walmart's communications team, said the new academies are part of a beefed-up training operation that began in 2015. Previous training was handled by the managers of each individual store, she said. "We'll be investing in training that our associates receive," said Jones. "The academy program is a result of that." The Alabama academies are part of 120 which have opened in the U.S. The goal, Jones said, is to open 200 of them by the end of 2017. The investments in Alabama are part of a $6.8 billion capital program nationwide, which includes the expansion and remodeling of stores, clubs and distribution centers. In addition, Walmart plans to expand its online grocery pickup services as the company positions itself to compete more aggressively against the online retail giant, Amazon. Walmart, which last year reported $486 billion in annual revenue - more than three times that of Amazon - accounted for 7.8 percent in online U.S. sales last year, according to an article in the The Washington Post. Amazon, by comparison, accounted for 33 percent of online sales. In Mobile, the company is banking on utilizing the State Docks to transport Walmart-bound containers to the distribution center, which is about a 15-minute drive along I-10. The distribution center will be serviced by approximately 600 or more trucks that will be moving back and forth daily. To accommodate the activity, the Alabama Department of Transportation is moving forward on a $33.4 million widening of I-10 from Carol Plantation Road west toward McDonald Road, which is next to the distribution center. And as the company presses forward on its distribution center expansion, some coastal Alabama entities are hoping to see some benefits. Among them is Feeding the Gulf Coast, formerly the Bay Area Food Bank, which relies heavily on Walmart contributions. The company provided $189,894 to Feeding the Gulf Coast last year, which was the largest contribution that Walmart made to a food bank in Alabama. Feeding the Gulf Coast is part of the Feeding America community, which is heavily supported by the company. In fiscal year 2014, Walmart accounted for 13 percent of total fundraising revenue for Feeding America, and 14.5 percent of the total pounds of food secured for food banks around the country. "We literally could not survive without the contributions of Walmart and our other retail partners," said Cathy Pope, president & CEO of Feeding the Gulf Coast, calling "Walmart a committed partner" in battling hunger relief. "They regularly donate time, food and funds to Feeding the Gulf Coast," Pope said. "We rely on their partnership and appreciate their efforts to end local hunger."

Top Retailers>Walmart Walmart: Happy employees sparking sales momentum Retailer highlights benefits of training program as it kicks off annual shareholder’s week Jon Springer | Jun 01, 2017 Wal-Mart Stores on Wednesday opened its annual Shareholders Week activities focusing on foundational progress the company has made since its first training academies opened just over a year ago. Since March 2016, the retailer has opened 155 such facilities with plans to reach 200 later this year. The academies are located adjacent to top regional Supercenters and have become the vehicle through which the company has driven process change that officials said have contributed to Walmart’s recent sales momentum, while reducing turnover and creating happier and more satisfied workers, Judith McKenna, Walmart’s U.S. COO, told a gathering of journalists visiting a Walmart academy alongside a store in Fayetteville, Ark. That is helping Walmart capture more sales at retail through better customer service and improved execution of the basics in stores like on-shelf availability. Ellie Bertani, Walmart's director of HR strategy and innovation, chats with Andy Van Kleunen, CEO of the National Skills Coalition, in a panel discussion regarding opportunity in retail held Wednesday in Fayetteville, Ark., as part of Walmart's annual Shareholders Week events. “The training program isn’t just for the here and now,” McKenna said. “It actually creates a platform for us for the future for everything else we want to do.” Related story: Walmart: Blockchain tech a boon for food safety Walmart established new training procedures as part of its $1.7 billion investment in employees announced in 2015, which also included wage increases, and has underpinned an operational rebound that also included new rounds of price investments and expansion of e-commerce. David Scott, SVP, talent and organizational development for Walmart. Around 250,000 U.S. Walmart employees will undergo academy training programs this year, which can last between two to six weeks. The program’s current focus is on department managers, assistant store managers and newly promoted workers, said Tom Ward, VP of U.S. central operations for Walmart, and includes a mix of classroom training and exercises on the floor of the adjoining stores. These employees are being trained to execute any number of duties and store processes that have been re-engineered over the past two years under Walmart’s U.S. leadership team including McKenna and Mark Ibbotson, Walmart’s U.S. EVP of central operations, who ran a similar training program at the company’s Asda chain in the United Kingdom prior to their U.S. assignment. Walmart associates, from left, Cris Norton, Courtney Elston, Alfredo Torres and C.J. West with Kristen Wilkenson, senior director of Walmart's U.S. Academy team. Ibbotson referred to the process changes — which touched virtually every duty employees have at a store — as “one best way” strategy that encourages standardization across stores. Officials demonstrated teaching methods including virtual reality to prepare workers for real-life situations and simulated shopping missions for customers. A panel of recent Walmart academy graduates testified that the program was helping them and their co-workers to find more meaning and direction in their careers, in part because it demonstrated that supervisors were vested in their work. “A lot of associates would get upset and leave the company because they felt they weren’t getting the proper training,” C.J. West, an assistant store manager in Fayetteville, said. “Their department managers, their supervisors, even their assistants weren’t involved. Now if you get the people the right training and allow them to develop and grow, you have a better chance at keeping your people. I know I wouldn’t want to work at some place where I wasn’t trained, and that’s happened here in years past.” TAGS: News 0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

Now the world’s biggest retailer is taking its customer service to new heights as it tests a program that turns store associates into delivery drivers for online orders. Continue Reading Below The idea behind the move is two-fold: It helps make Walmart better able to compete with the quick delivery times and low prices heralded by chief e-commerce rival Amazon (AMZN), while also cutting down on delivery costs for the final leg of the trip, which is often the most expensive. The idea, currently tested in three stores – two in New Jersey and one in northwest Arkansas, is a win-win for customers and the $241 billion company, Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce president and CEO Mark Lore wrote in a blog post Thursday. “We already have trucks moving orders from fulfilment centers to stores for pickup. Those same trucks could be used to bring ship-to-home orders to a store close to their final destination, where a participating associate can sign up to deliver them to the customer’s house,” he said. Related content Walmart Extends Online Discounts, Cuts More Jobs Amid Pricing War with Amazon After Losing Customers to Walmart and Kroger, Whole Foods Fights to Keep 'Whole Foodies' Amazon hits fresh record: Shares top $1K Becoming a delivery driver, though, isn’t required for employees, Lore stressed, but rather an opportunity to earn extra cash. Those who want to, can opt into the program and have control over things like how many packages they deliver, and size and weight limits of each shipment. Once seen as a disadvantage in a rapidly-changing retail landscape that favors e-commerce, Walmart has suddenly turned its 4,700 U.S. stores into an asset that not only allows shoppers to browse and buy in-store, but also transform into mini distribution centers. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT “Our stores put us within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population. Now imagine all the routes our associates drive to and from work and the houses they pass along the way. It’s easy to see why this test could be a game changer,” Lore said.  This pilot program isn’t Walmart’s first foray into making life easier for customers as it tries to better compete with Amazon. In 2015 it agreed to buy Amazon’s smaller rival Jet.com – a move that has allowed the Oakbrook, Ill.-based company’s online experience to explode. Helped by the acquisition, growth in e-commerce for the first quarter jumped 63%. Back in April, Walmart launched what it calls a Pickup Discount, lower prices on roughly 10,000 items that customers can purchase on the store’s website and have sent to any Walmart store for pickup. The aim was to lower the company’s delivery costs on the last mile while also encouraging shoppers to peruse its e-commerce platform. Earlier this year, the company introduced no membership required free two-day shipping on two million items – a clear shot at Amazon’s Prime membership which, for $99 annually, gives consumers free-shipping on all orders regardless of basket size.  Shares of Walmart hit a fresh record high of $79.60 on Thursday, adding to gains of more than 13% so far this year.   What do you think?

The superstore reached a deal with Morgan a year after the deadly accident on the New Jersey Turnpike that killed his friend, comedian James 'Jimmy Mack' McNair, and left the Saturday Night Live alumnus severely injured. But Walmart's hasty settlement has been blasted by its insurer, which says the retail giant paid out the large sum without deposing Morgan and others involved in the suit. Walmart's insurance company is demanding Tracy Morgan, 48, be deposed over his multimillion-dollar payout stemming from the 2014 car accident involving the retailer's truck Court documents obtained by Dailymail.com reveal lawyers for insurance company Ohio Casualty are now requesting deposition dates from Morgan and his comedian friend Ardley Fuqua, who was a passenger in the car.  The company is attempting to force Morgan and Fuqua to hand over settlement documents, as well as medical records and information regarding the comedian's income. They are also seeking all medical records following the accident, Morgan's federal and state tax returns from 2009-2014, documents showing his future earning potential, and financial records that relate to his earnings for the five years prior to the accident. Morgan spent almost two months in the hospital and rehab following the accident before he could return home. Pictured is the Walmart truck after the crash A tractor-trailer driven by Walmart employee Kevin Roper slammed into the back of their limo on the New Jersey Turnpike on June 7, 2014 The star has spoken about how he had to learn how to talk and walk again following the medically induced coma doctors placed him in They are even demanding a list of medicines he was prescribed after the crash, any records of physical or mental examinations and documents related to his appearance on Saturday Night Live and The Emmys - and information regarding his ability to drive a Lamborghini after the accident.  According to the court papers, Ohio Casualty argues the depositions of both Morgan and his comedian friend Ardie Fuqua are relevant and necessary since the two of them received 92 percent of the huge settlement paid out in the comedian's original lawsuit against Walmart. Morgan received 80 per cent of an undisclosed sum paid out to all plaintiffs in his legal battle. The 48-year-old's payout is rumored to be as much as $90 million.  The demands come 13 months after the Morgan and Fuqua were served with subpoenas to provide information to the case and failed to respond. The pair were also accused of refusing to provide dates to be deposed and failing to provide an adequate excuse for his refusal after multiple attempts.  'The depositions of Morgan and Fuqua are relevant and necessary, because they collectively received 92% of the huge settlement of the Morgan action, their depositions were never taken nor were they served with any formal discovery in the Morgan action, and Wal-Mart [sic] has relied on the claims of Morgan and Fuqua as the principal reason in contending that the settlement of the Morgan action was reasonable,' the documents state.  The insurance company is also requesting deposition dates from Morgan's comedian friend Ardley Fuqua (left) who was injured in the accident which killed James 'Jimmy Mack' McNair (right) Emails between the parties' attorneys show Morgan and Fuqua's lawyer, David E. Ross said they would comply with the subpoenas if the plaintiff agreed to certain conditions - which is not required. 'The sole reason Morgan and Fuqua have refused to provide deposition dates is their insistence that Plaintiffs provide information that is not required under the federal rules and accept their unconditional reservation of all rights, including their reservation not to appear for a deposition at all.  'This is a baseless position designed to avoid giving dates for their depositions. 'For these reasons, Plaintiffs ask that Tracy Morgan and Ardley Fuqua be ordered to each provide Plaintiffs with dates on which they can appear for a 7-hour deposition pursuant to the subpoenas.' Morgan could potentially be held in contempt of court for failing to provide an 'adequate excuse.'  Emails show Ross refused to cough up any information - calling attorney Paul R. Koepff's actions a 'lack of good faith' and 'an intention to harass rather than serve subpoenas.' RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Giddy up! Gigi Hadid struts around New York in knee-high...

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print BENTONVILLE, Ark. — In its latest effort to compete with online giant Amazon, Walmart is testing a delivery service using its own store employees, who will deliver packages ordered online while driving home from their regular work shifts. The “associate delivery” program would use Walmart’s 4,700 U.S. stores and roughly 1.2 million employees to speed delivery and cut costs. The world’s largest retailer says workers can choose to participate and would be paid. The service is being tested at two stores in New Jersey and one in Arkansas. Walmart has stores within 10 miles of 90 percent of the U.S. population, the company says. “Now imagine all the routes our associates drive to and from work and the houses they pass along the way,” Marc Lore, CEO of Walmart’s U.S. online operations, wrote on the company website. Ravi Jariwala, a Walmart spokesman, said all those employees driving home represent a “very dense web” of potential delivery locations for the company. Employees who want to participate will be able to use an app to specify how many packages they are willing to deliver, Jariwala said, as well as the weight and size limits on the packages. Jariwala would not provide details about how workers would be paid, but said the company would comply with all federal and state minimum wage and overtime laws. “This is completely an opt-in program,” he said today. “This is not something they are required to do.” So far, employees “love having the option to earn more cash while doing something that’s already part of their daily routine,” Lore wrote. The move could result in significant cost savings, though the company didn’t provide estimates of how much. Still, the final delivery step to a customer’s home — what the industry refers to as the “last mile” — “makes up the lion’s share of fulfillment costs,” Jariwala said. The move is the latest step in Walmart’s campaign to counter Amazon’s online dominance. Shoppers on Walmart.com can already choose to pick up items at a nearby store for a lower price. Walmart has also revamped its shipping program and offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase of $35. In its tests so far, Walmart says “many” packages are arriving at customers’ homes just a day after an order has been placed. Participating employees will have to undergo background checks and will need clean driving records, Jariwala said. Faster shipping has become a key area of competition as online retail continues to grow at a double-digit pace, while traditional brick-and-mortar stores struggle with falling sales. Members of Amazon’s $99-a-year Prime service in thousands of areas can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. And in about 30 cities, Prime Now members can get some items in an hour or two. Walmart has previously tested delivery services using Uber drivers. Jariwala said that test is still going on.

The 'associate delivery' program would use Walmart's 4,700 U.S. stores and roughly 1.2 million employees to speed delivery and cut costs. The world's largest retailer says workers can choose to participate and would be paid.  A Walmart store, in Dallas. Walmart is testing a delivery service using its own store employees, who will deliver packages ordered online while driving home from their regular work shifts. The world's largest retailer says workers can choose to participate and would be paid. HOW IT WORKS  Ship-to-home orders to a store close to their final destination, where a participating associate can sign up to deliver them to the customer’s house.  Associates choose how many packages they can deliver, the size and weight limits of those packages and which days they’re able to make deliveries after work – it’s completely up to them, and they can update those preferences at any time.  The software also allocate packages based on minimizing the collective distance they need to travel off of their commute to make a delivery. The service is being tested at two stores in New Jersey and one in Arkansas. Walmart has stores within 10 miles of 90 percent of the U.S. population, the company says. 'It just makes sense: We already have trucks moving orders from fulfillment centers to stores for pickup,' Marc Lore, CEO of Walmart's U.S. online operations, wrote on the company website. 'Those same trucks could be used to bring ship-to-home orders to a store close to their final destination, where a participating associate can sign up to deliver them to the customer’s house.  'The best part is this gives our own associates a way to earn extra income on their existing drive home.  'Now imagine all the routes our associates drive to and from work and the houses they pass along the way,' Ravi Jariwala, a Walmart spokesman, said all those employees driving home represent a 'very dense web' of potential delivery locations for the company. Employees who want to participate will be able to use an app to specify how many packages they are willing to deliver, Jariwala said, as well as the weight and size limits on the packages.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Climate change could kill off coastal nesting birds: Study...

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) Share Written by Oliver Staley June 01, 2017 Walmart, which is aggressively investing in e-commerce to better compete with Amazon, is unveiling a new strategy: turning its army of 1.5 million US employees into delivery drivers. The tactic is being tested at three stores in New Jersey and Arkansas, and designed to shave costs out of the “last mile” of distribution, the most expensive part of getting goods to customers. The initiative was announced today (June 1) at Walmart’s headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, and in a blog post by Marc Lore, who heads e-commerce operations for Walmart. Lore is the former CEO of e-commerce startup Jet.com, which was acquired last year by Walmart for $3.5 billion to take on Amazon. Under the initiative, store employees will be given the option to deliver packages on their way home after work, in exchange for extra pay. They’ll be given an app that allows them to input their routes, and an algorithm will plot the most efficient path. To take part, the employees will have to pass a background and vehicle check. In the pilot, most merchandise was delivered the day after the order was placed, beating Walmart’s pledge of second-day delivery. Walmart’s digital strategy relies on leveraging its enormous investments in infrastructure and employees. The company has 4,700 US stores and 6,100 trucks, and it hopes to be able to use those assets to narrow the gap with Amazon. Walmart is rolling out a grocery pick-up service, where online orders are delivered to customers’ cars, and is testing other ways of combining online shopping with its physical stores. Walmart’s online deliveries are now shipped from its warehouses to online fulfillment centers, then taken to customers by couriers like UPS and FedEx, sometimes hundreds of miles. Under the new plan, e-commerce goods would be shipped by Walmart’s fleet of trucks to stores, then the last mile by employees. If there aren’t enough employees available, Walmart will use normal couriers. By deputizing its associates as delivery drivers, Walmart may be signaling the end of its experiment of using Lyft and Uber drivers as couriers. “This is very different from crowd-sourced delivery,” Lore said in Bentonville. “It pulls out a tremendous amount of time from that last mile, which pulls out a tremendous amount of cost.” Most Popular Open-minded people have a different visual perception of reality Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

One store in Northwest Arkansas and two and in New Jersey were used to conduct the tests for about four weeks. They delivered dozens of packages to customer homes, most often the day after they were ordered online, according to Ravi Jariwalla, corporate spokesman for Walmart U.S. e-commerce. Jariwalla did not say how much the employees earn for opting into this service, but he did say it’s added pay they can earn while driving home on their normal route. The employees have the choice to participate, but everyone who is chosen for the final mile tasks must pass a background check and their driving record is also reviewed. Employees may choose the days they want to deliver, the size and weight of the packages and how many deliveries they want to make. Wal-Mart has created an algorithm that overlaps employee addresses with delivery destinations on customer orders. The company said an employee will not be asked to drive out of their way to deliver a package. “Think about where our associates live and it’s very close to where the orders are coming from creating a web optimized for final mile,” Jariwalla said. He said Wal-Mart is using its trucks to move the online orders from fulfillment centers to the store, then using participating employees to run the final delivery leg. He said it’s taking costs and time out of the supply chain and employees are able to earn extra money in the process. Final mile is the most expensive leg of the the supply chain and Jariwala said the company has made dozens of deliveries and the majority of the orders arrive the next day, even faster than the two-day guaranteed free delivery on orders over $35. Just last year Wal-Mart announced it was piloting the use of Lyft and Uber to facilitate grocery delivery in select markets. Jariwalla said those test are ongoing, and the new final mile option is for general merchandise only. “Associates are fully in control of their experience. … We allocate packages based on minimizing the collective distance they need to travel off of their commute to make a delivery,” he said. When asked about how long it might take for the retailer to roll out this service, he said they are still in the trial phase and it’s too early to discuss a roll out. Given Wal-Mart’s store footprint of almost 4,700 stores and 1.5 million employees combined with the 10-mile proximity most customers have to a Walmart store, it’s possible the idea of employee delivery could help with the final mile dilemma faced by retailers. “The response from our associates and customers has been great. An unexpected benefit for our associates is that many of them have found quicker routes home thanks to the GPS built into the app,” Jariwalla said. He said the company continues to test different processes as it strives to offer customers savings and convenience. He said the pick-up discount recently announced is about saving customers’ money, but for others the home delivery is about convenience. Walmart is uniquely positioned to offer this service, Jariwalla said. “Wal-Mart feels very different on June 1 than it did on January 1. … Walmart U.S. e-commerce CEO Marc Lore will talk more about this final mile delivery test,” he said. Following is the complete – and unedited – message Lore posted Thursday. Leveraging our Strengths and Assets to Serve Customers in New Ways: Walmart Begins Testing Associate Delivery The best innovations are the ones that truly help customers save time and money. We’re doing a lot of both. Online Grocery Pickup and two-day free shipping are saving people tons of time, and our new Pickup Discount is using our massive fleet of trucks to get online orders to stores where customers can pick up items for an additional discount and save even more money. Now, our latest test is taking this another step further and leveraging one of our greatest assets – our associates – to get online orders to customers’ doors. Why is that a big deal? Not only can this cut shipping costs and get packages to their final destinations faster and more efficiently, it creates a special win-win-win for customers, associates and the business. It just makes sense: We already have trucks moving orders from fulfillment centers to stores for pickup. Those same trucks could be used to bring ship-to-home orders to a store close to their final destination, where a participating associate can sign up to deliver them to the customer’s house. The best part is this gives our own associates a way to earn extra income on their existing drive home. Associates are fully in control of their experience. If they don’t want to participate, they don’t have to. If they choose to opt in, we’ve built technology that allows them to set preferences. Associates choose how many packages they can deliver, the size and weight limits of those packages and which days they’re able to make deliveries after work – it’s completely up to them, and they can update those preferences at any time. We also allocate packages based on minimizing the collective distance they need to travel off of their commute to make a delivery. Walmart has strength in numbers with 4,700 stores across the U.S. and more than a million associates. Our stores put us within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population. Now imagine all the routes our associates drive to and from work and the houses they pass along the way. It’s easy to see why this test could be a game-changer. We’re starting small with three test stores – two in New Jersey and one in northwest Arkansas – but the response from associates and customers has been great. Many orders are being delivered the next day, and associates love having the option to earn more cash while doing something that’s already part of their daily routine. An unexpected benefit is they’re finding quicker routes home thanks to the GPS built into our proprietary app. This last-mile innovation is one of a kind. Unlike crowdsourced delivery, where the driver has to travel (often out of the way) to pick up the package, then drive the full distance to deliver it, our associates are starting at the same place as the packages. Once they’re done working at the store for the day, they pick up the packages from the backroom, load them into their vehicle, enter the delivery addresses into the GPS on their phone and head towards home. What I’m most proud of is how all areas of Walmart, from e-commerce to store operations to supply chain, came together to innovate rapidly for our customers – and in a way that puts our associates in control. I’m sure you can imagine how we can leverage these types of last-mile innovations in the future to deliver items offered in our stores to customers the same day. I’m excited to continue exploring more ways to bring our digital and physical strengths together to serve customers.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Walmart's newest tactic in its fight against online giant Amazon: Asking its employees to deliver online orders on their way home from work. The idea, Walmart executives said Thursday, is to cut costs on the so-called last-mile of deliveries, when packages are driven to customers' homes, often the most expensive part of the fulfillment process. "It just makes sense: We already have trucks moving orders from fulfillment centers to stores for pickup," Marc Lore, chief executive of Walmart's eCommerce business, and the founder of Jet.com, said in a blog post Thursday afternoon. "Those same trucks could be used to bring ship-to-home orders to a store close to their final destination, where a participating associate can sign up to deliver them to the customer's house." The company began testing the package-delivery program a month ago in three stores - two in New Jersey, one in northwest Arkansas - but did not offer details on when, or where, it would expand across the United States. Employees will be paid extra, and offered overtime pay as necessary to make the deliveries, Walmart spokesman Ravi Jariwala said Thursday. "Walmart is uniquely qualified, uniquely positioned, to be able to offer this," he said, adding that 90 percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store. "There is really strong overlap between where are associates are already heading after work and where those packages need to go." The company is billing the program as a way for employees to earn extra money, although there were few details on how they would be paid. Jariwala declined to clarify whether employees would be paid based on distance, time, number of deliveries or a combination of those things. Jariwala said Walmart employees have delivered hundreds of packages over the last month, fulfilling orders placed on Jet.com, which Walmart acquired last year, as well as Walmart's own website. The announcement comes as Walmart doubles down on its online business, where sales grew 63 percent in the first quarter of this year. The company - long the country's largest retailer - has taken aggressive steps in the past year, beginning with its $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com to compete with Amazon.com, which currently accounts for about 33 percent of the country's online sales. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) Walmart has also been rapidly expanding its grocery pickup program, in which shoppers retrieve online orders in the parking lots of a nearby store. More recently, the company has begun offering discounts on certain digital purchases if customers opt to pick them up in-store. In that model, Walmart uses its own trucking fleet to deliver packages to stores, tapping into an existing transportation network. A year ago, Walmart announced it would partner with ride-sharing services like Uber, Lyft and Deliv to deliver groceries in Phoenix, Denver and Miami. Those efforts are ongoing, Jariwala said. Walmart's move comes as Amazon continues to build up its transportation and logistics firepower to support speedy delivery. Amazon.com has leased a fleet of 40 cargo jets to bolster its supply chain, and has developed an Amazon-branded trucking fleet. The Seattle-based company has also created Amazon Flex, an on-demand network of drivers, in which the model is similar to Uber or Lyft. The program is voluntary for Walmart employees, Jariwala said, adding that they can sign up for up to 10 deliveries per day using a company app. They can also set size and weight limits on packages. If there are not enough employees to deliver packages, Jariwala said carriers like UPS and FedEx would fill in. "This is completely an opt-in program," he said. "This is not something associates are required to do. They are, first and foremost, always going to finish their shift."

Published on June 01, 2017. Meet your new Walmart delivery driver. Credit: Walmart Most Popular Walmart has a new idea for beating the high cost of shipping e-commerce packages – paying store employees to deliver them on their way home. The program aims at using one of Walmart's biggest assets – more than a million U.S. store employees – to help close its big e-commerce sales gap with Amazon. Walmart has more than 4,700 stores, putting potential delivery nodes within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population. In a test that launched a month ago in two stores in New Jersey and one in Northwest Arkansas, employees can opt in to deliver packages on their way home for extra pay. They use an app that offers opportunities to deliver up to 10 packages per commute. In a news conference in Bentonville on Thursday, spokesman Ravi Jariwala said the program is entirely voluntary. He declined to specify the pay, but said finding the right compensation is part of the test. And he said the retailer will comply with all applicable state and federal labor laws, such as those covering overtime. "It just makes sense," said Walmart E-Commerce chief Marc Lore in a blog post. "We already have trucks moving orders from fulfillment centers to to stores for pickup. Those same trucks could be used to bring ship-to-home orders to a store close to their final destination, where a participating employee can sign up to deliver them to the customer's house." Related Stories Walmart's E-Commerce Surge and Other Takeaways for Brands Four Things to Expect from Walmart's Shareholder Week Walmart e-commerce is on a roll, with eye-popping 63% sales growth last quarter -- more than half of it organically from the legacy Walmart.com business rather than Jet.com acquired last September. Dropping the annual membership fee for free two-day delivery and offering discounts for picking up products in store have fueled that growth. But those things also add costs to an e-commerce business that has yet to make a profit. Employees will wear their vests during the home commute/delivery trip and knock on doors of recipients, Jariwala said. If they're not home, employees will leave the package on the doorstep and take photos with their phones as proof of delivery. Employees who volunteer for the program will get background and motor-vehicle safety checks. Walmart previously has considered having customers deliver e-commerce packages -- but having employees do the same thing adds an extra element of control. Walmart also continues tests launched last year in Phoenix and Denver with Uber and Lyft to have their drivers deliver its packages to homes. But unlike "crowdsourced solutions" where drivers have to go out of their way to pick up and then deliver the packages, Lore noted that Walmart employees start from the shipping site and will be using routes that don't take them out of the way. "I'm sure you can imagine how we can leverage these types of last-mile innovations in the future to deliver items offered in our stores to customers the same day," Lore said.

The "associate delivery" program would use Walmart's 4,700 U.S. stores and roughly 1.2 million employees to speed delivery and cut costs.

BENTONVILLE — In its latest effort to compete with online giant Amazon, Wal-Mart is testing a delivery service using its own store employees, who will deliver packages ordered online while driving home from their regular work shifts. The "associate delivery" program would use Wal-Mart's 4,700 U.S. stores and roughly 1.2 million employees to speed delivery and cut costs.

In its tests so far, Walmart says “many” packages are arriving at customers’ homes just a day after an order has been placed. Participating employees will have to undergo background checks and will need clean driving records, Jariwala said. Faster shipping has become a key area of competition as online retail continues to grow at a double-digit pace, while traditional brick-and-mortar stores struggle with falling sales. Members of Amazon’s $99-a-year Prime service in thousands of areas can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. And in about 30 cities, Prime Now members can get some items in an hour or two. Walmart has previously tested delivery services using Uber drivers. Jariwala said that test is still going on. 116 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Hristo Uzunov/Shutterstock)    Teen Girl Accused Of Hacking Chicago Uber Driver To Death In Unprovoked Attack Will Racke 1:54 PM 06/01/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP A teenage girl from Chicago has been charged with the gruesome slaying of an Uber driver, whom she allegedly stabbed to death with a knife and machete she stole from Walmart just minutes before the unprovoked attack. Eliza Wasni, 16, was charged Wednesday afternoon with the murder of Grant Nelson, a 34-year-old man from suburban Wilmette. A Cook County judge ordered her held without bail for an act prosecutors called “heinous” and “not provoked in any manner,” the Chicago Tribune reported. Police say that Nelson had picked up Wasni early Tuesday a few blocks from a Walmart in the nearby town of Skokie. Minutes into the ride, she began stabbing him from the back seat. Nelson was able to pull over and escape to a condominium building lobby, where he pleaded with bystanders for assistance. “Help me, help me. I’m going to die,” he said, according to Assistant State’s Attorney Michelle Cunningham. While Nelson bled out in the condo lobby, prosecutors say, Wasni took off in his car, immediately crashed into a median, and fled on foot. She was found nearby wearing only a bra and leggings, with a trail of blood leading responding officers to the condominium lobby where Nelson lay. The Uber driver, who prosecutors say was a “random victim,” was able to describe Wasni to police but later died at a nearby hospital. During Wasni’s hearing, Nelson’s family members sobbed when prosecutors described him begging for help in the lobby before he was found on the ground outside in a pool of blood, reports the Tribune. Surveillance video footage from Walmart showed Wasni walking around the store with a knife and machete and then leaving without paying for them, according to Cunningham. The teenager took two Uber rides before hailing Nelson near the Walmart, apparently in violation of a company policy that requires riders to be at least 18 years old. An Uber spokeswoman said in a statement Wednesday the company is “heartbroken by the loss of one of our partners, Grant Nelson. Our deepest sympathies and prayers are with his family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time.” Cook County Judge Michael Hood ordered Wasni to be held without bail, and prosecutors are charging the 16-year-old as an adult with first-degree murder.

RUGABER AP Economics Writer BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) - In its latest effort to compete with online giant Amazon, Walmart is testing a delivery service using its own store employees, who will deliver packages ordered online while driving home from their regular work shifts. The "associate delivery" program would use Walmart's 4,700 U.S. stores and roughly 1.2 million employees to speed delivery and cut costs, the company said Thursday. The announcement came just a day before the company's annual meeting. The world's largest retailer says workers can choose to participate and would be paid. The service is being tested at two stores in New Jersey and one in Arkansas. Walmart has stores within 10 miles of 90 percent of the U.S. population, the company says. "Now imagine all the routes our associates drive to and from work and the houses they pass along the way," Marc Lore, CEO of Walmart's U.S. online operations, wrote on the company website. Ravi Jariwala, a Walmart spokesman, said all those employees driving home represent a "very dense web" of potential delivery locations for the company. Employees who want to participate will be able to use an app to specify how many packages they are willing to deliver, Jariwala said, as well as the weight and size limits on the packages. Jariwala would not provide details about how workers would be paid, but said the company would comply with all federal and state minimum wage and overtime laws. "This is completely an opt-in program," he said Thursday. "This is not something they are required to do." So far, employees "love having the option to earn more cash while doing something that's already part of their daily routine," Lore wrote. Some critics of Walmart's labor practices questioned how voluntary such a program will be. "When so many workers are paid so little that they need government assistance to make ends meet, it becomes a necessity, not a choice, to do what they can to earn more," said Randy Parraz, director of Making Change at Walmart, a group funded by the United Food and Commercial Workers. The move could result in significant cost savings, though the company didn't provide estimates of how much. Still, the final delivery step to a customer's home - what the industry refers to as the "last mile" - "makes up the lion's share of fulfillment costs," Jariwala said. The move is the latest step in Walmart's campaign to counter Amazon's online dominance. Shoppers on Walmart.com can already choose to pick up items at a nearby store for a lower price. Walmart has also revamped its shipping program and offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase of $35. In its tests so far, Walmart says "many" packages are arriving at customers' homes just a day after an order has been placed. Participating employees will have to undergo background checks and a check on their driving records, Jariwala said. Faster shipping has become a key area of competition as online retail continues to grow at a double-digit pace, while traditional brick-and-mortar stores struggle with falling sales. Members of Amazon's $99-a-year Prime service in thousands of areas can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. And in about 30 cities, Prime Now members can get some items in an hour or two. Walmart has previously tested delivery services using Uber drivers. Jariwala said that test is still going on. But Lore noted that the employee delivery service would save a step compared with third-party services that require a driver to travel to a store to pick up a good, then deliver it, then return home. Walmart workers would simply travel from the store they already work at to make the delivery. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Sharrie Williams reports during Action News at 4:30 p.m. on June 1, 2017. (WPVI) AP Thursday, June 01, 2017 06:03PM LINCOLNWOOD, Ill. -- A 16-year-old girl walked out of a suburban Chicago Walmart holding a machete and knife she'd stolen, climbed into an Uber car and began hacking at the driver, prosecutors said at a hearing on Wednesday. The driver died of his wounds Tuesday after giving police a description of the attacker that led to her arrest. A prosecutor read in court a description of the attack that said Eliza Wasni simply climbed into a car driven by 34-year-old Grant Nelson, and stabbed him and hacked him to death early Tuesday morning. The judge ordered the girl, who was charged as an adult with first-degree murder, held without bond. The 2-page description offers no reason for the attack, but portrays Wasni as a calm girl who "nonchalantly" could be seen walking through Walmart, the knives in hand, before she walked outside without paying. EMBED More News Videos <iframe width="476" height="267" src="http://6abc.com/video/embed/?pid=2060809" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> 16-year-old girl accused of hacking Illinois Uber driver to death. Watch the report from June 1, 2017. Prosecutors said that Nelson, a resident of Wilmette, picked the girl up shortly after 3 a.m. Tuesday in Lincolnwood. It was her third ride in an Uber vehicle in the early morning hours of Tuesday. Two minutes after he began driving, prosecutors said that Wasni began stabbing Nelson from the back seat. Nelson was able to pull over and ran into a nearby condominium building, where he screamed, "Help me, help me! I'm going to die!" until residents called 911. Wasni climbed into the front seat of Nelson's blood-splattered silver sedan and drove away, striking a median in the road. She jumped out of the vehicle and fled on foot. When Lincolnwood police arrived, they found the vehiclewith blood on both the inside and the outside, with Nelson's phone open to the Uber app. The app said that Nelson's passenger was someone named Eliza. Officers followed the trail of blood and found Nelson lying in grass. He was bleeding profusely from several wounds, and was able to tell the officers what had happened. He died at a nearby hospital a few hours later. Using the description given by Nelson, police found her nearby crouching behind an air conditioner - a machete in one hand and a knife in the other. Police warned her that she would be shot with a Taser if she did not drop the weapons, and when she did not comply an officer used the Taser. Wasni dropped the knives and was taken into custody. Police said she did not make a statement. According to prosecutors, police recovered a shirt the girl could be seen wearing in the Walmart. The shirt had blood on it. Uber officials said the company was working with police to provide information relevant to the investigation. "We are heartbroken by the loss of one of our partners," Uber said in a statement. "Our deepest sympathies and prayers are with his family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time." Nelson's sister, Alex Nelson, told WMAQ-TV in Chicago that her brother was a good person. "He was not a vindictive person," Alex Nelson said. "He was not a cruel person. He didn't deserve this fate." It is the first homicide in Lincolnwood since 2006, police said. ---------- Send a breaking news alert Report a correction or typo Learn more about the 6abc apps Related Topics: newsu.s. & worldubermurderteenagermacheteIllinois Email share share tweet email (Copyright ©2017 by The Associated Press.

Advertisement “Now imagine all the routes our associates drive to and from work and the houses they pass along the way,” Marc Lore, CEO of Walmart’s U.S. online operations, wrote on the company website. Ravi Jariwala, a Walmart spokesman, said all those employees driving home represent a “very dense web” of potential delivery locations for the company. Employees who want to participate will be able to use an app to specify how many packages they are willing to deliver, Jariwala said, as well as the weight and size limits on the packages. Jariwala would not provide details about how workers would be paid, but said the company would comply with all federal and state minimum wage and overtime laws. “This is completely an opt-in program,” he said Thursday. “This is not something they are required to do.” So far, employees “love having the option to earn more cash while doing something that’s already part of their daily routine,” Lore wrote. Some critics of Walmart’s labor practices questioned how voluntary such a program will be. Check out Federal News Radio's latest podcasts. “When so many workers are paid so little that they need government assistance to make ends meet, it becomes a necessity, not a choice, to do what they can to earn more,” said Randy Parraz, director of Making Change at Walmart, a group funded by the United Food and Commercial Workers. The move could result in significant cost savings, though the company didn’t provide estimates of how much. Still, the final delivery step to a customer’s home — what the industry refers to as the “last mile” — “makes up the lion’s share of fulfillment costs,” Jariwala said. The move is the latest step in Walmart’s campaign to counter Amazon’s online dominance. Shoppers on Walmart.com can already choose to pick up items at a nearby store for a lower price. Walmart has also revamped its shipping program and offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase of $35. In its tests so far, Walmart says “many” packages are arriving at customers’ homes just a day after an order has been placed. Participating employees will have to undergo background checks and a check on their driving records, Jariwala said. Faster shipping has become a key area of competition as online retail continues to grow at a double-digit pace, while traditional brick-and-mortar stores struggle with falling sales. Members of Amazon’s $99-a-year Prime service in thousands of areas can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. And in about 30 cities, Prime Now members can get some items in an hour or two. Walmart has previously tested delivery services using Uber drivers. Jariwala said that test is still going on. But Lore noted that the employee delivery service would save a step compared with third-party services that require a driver to travel to a store to pick up a good, then deliver it, then return home. Walmart workers would simply travel from the store they already work at to make the delivery.

This announcement comes during a Role of Digital at Walmart meeting during Walmart Shareholders Week. The new delivery system will get online orders to customers' doors using Walmart associates. Walmart said the test program will cut shipping costs and get the packages to their destinations faster. President and CEO of Walmart E-Commerce Marc Lore said this program is optional for the associates. "Imagine hundreds of associates they live all around different neighborhoods around the Walmart,” he said. "We take the packages and say okay this associate lives over here and they're going to drive this way. Here's one one along the route." Delivery trucks will be used to bring ship-to-home orders to a store close to the final destination, where an associate can sign up to deliver the items to the customer's house. Walmart spokesperson Danit Marquardt said this gives associates a way to earn extra income on their drive home. With this test program, most packages are delivered the day after the customer places the order. Amazon has something similar, as they offer same-day delivery services in a lot of locations across the country. “This is, you know, an interesting test and a great test that we are doing to ultimately leverage our unique assets including our stores, our fulfillment networks and our group of associates,” she said. Associates will be able to choose how many packages they can deliver, the size and weight limits of each package and which days they are able to make deliveries. Walmart developed an app for this that allows the associates to put in their address and it gives them packages they can deliver on their commute route. “Imagine in the future the possibilities once this network is built out,” Lore said. "It allows people to deliver products that are already in the store, fresh or whatever the same day to customers." Walmart is testing this delivery system in three stores, two in New Jersey and one in Northwest Arkansas.

Retail Search Search aerospace and defenseOculus Founder Palmer Luckey Is Working on a Defense Startup Entrepreneur3 Questions You Should Ask Yourself Before Quitting Your Job trump budgetWhat the U.S. Loses If Trump Eliminates AmeriCorps CybersecurityBritain PM Theresa May Calls to ‘Regulate Cyberspace’ And Critics Are Going Ballistic E-commerce Walmart Recruits Its Store Workers to Make Deliveries on Their Drive Home Phil Wahba Jun 01, 2017 Walmart (wmt) has lined up new soldiers in the delivery wars with Amazon.com (amzn): Its own store workers. The discount giant is testing home delivery of some orders by Walmart associates heading home for the day in their own cars, offering them extra pay and the ability to opt in our out at will, the head of Walmart U.S.' e-commerce Marc Lore said in a blog post on Thursday. The delivery destinations will be close to where a worker lives or on the way to that person's home. The idea is to have yet another option for completing the so-called last mile in a delivery—the portion between a store or distribution center and the customer's home that is by far the costliest part of delivery-- and increase speed as well as lower costs for Walmart. There is a Walmart store within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population, "Not only can this cut shipping costs and get packages to their final destinations faster and more efficiently, it creates a special win-win-win for customers, associates and the business," Lore said in the post. So far, the test, begun in April, is at two Walmart locations in New Jersey, where the company's Jet.com subsidiary is based, and in Northwest Arkansas where Wal-Mart Stores is headquartered and has involved only a few hundred orders. Those involve home delivery of general merchandise, which can include dry foods but not fresh or refrigerated items. (The company is testing out home grocery delivery in two markets—Denver and Phoenix—with Uber, but is largely focusing on drive-by pick up for fresh and refrigerated food orders.) Crucially, those orders have typically been for next-day delivery, said Walmart spokesman Ravi Jariwala. That is no small matter at a time Amazon is working on its own ways to speed up delivery, including opening up physical stores and testing the use of drones, moves likely to soon make next day delivery as basic a service as two-day delivery is now. The test comes on the heels of other moves by Walmart to improve delivery since Lore, who sold Jet.com to Walmart for $3 billion, took the reins of its U.S. online business last summer. Walmart recently gave customers an incentive to pick up online orders in stores by lowering the fees, passing on some of the shipping cost savings. And in January, it lowered its minimum threshold for free two-day delivery to $35, leading Amazon to make the rare move of following a competitor and lowering its own minimum. Walmart has also significantly beefed up its online marketplace, helping it clock 63% e-commerce growth last quarter. While Walmart declined to say whether participating store workers get paid a fee for the delivery or simply more for the extra hours, nor discuss potential insurance issues, it did say those associates would have complete discretion in choosing how many packages to delivery (though the limit will be 10 deliveries), their size and weight, and how far. Those workers have been given an app that allows them to make those specifications, and Walmart's routing algorithm assigns orders accordingly. Customers don't know when they place their order whether it will be delivered by couriers like FedEx, UPS or the U.S. Postal Service, or by Walmart, but store workers will be clad in their work clothes to make them identifiable.

Seven people are going to federal prison for using stolen credit card numbers and counterfeit gift cards to buy more than $1 million in cigarettes in North Carolina. The defendants then sold those cigarettes on the black market, completing a scheme that began with stolen credit information they obtained from overseas hackers. Federal prosecutors said they encoded the credit card info onto gift cards, which they took to Walmart stores and bought genuine Walmart gift cards. The genuine gift cards were then taken to Sam's Club stores to buy the cigarettes. A statement from US Attorney John Stuart Bruce says they received sentences of about 3 years to 12 years Wednesday after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering and aggravated identity theft.

Participation in the program by the store staff is voluntary. The program is currently being tested in two New Jersey locations and one in Arkansas. Courtney Reagan | @CourtReagan Thursday, 1 Jun 2017 | 1:21 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Wal-Mart testing employee delivery program in 2 states    Thursday, 1 Jun 2017 | 1:25 PM ET | 01:20 Walmart.com and Jet.com shoppers in three U.S. cities now have a new delivery person, and it's not employees of one of the major shipping companies like FedEx or UPS or a delivery start-up like Instacart or Deliv. It's a Wal-Mart store employee. "Unlike crowdsourced delivery, where the driver has to travel (often out of the way) to pick up the package, then drive the full distance to deliver it, our associates are starting at the same place as the packages," said Marc Lore, president and CEO of Walmart eCommerce U.S., in a blog post for the retailer. It all works through a proprietary app the retailer built for this test. The app matches online order delivery addresses with employees' driving routes home from work, built to minimize any more driving than what the employee would do anyway to get home. Delivering is completely voluntary, and the employees can choose when they want to deliver, how many packages they can take and what size. "Once they're done working at the store for the day, they pick up the packages from the backroom, load them into their vehicle, enter the delivery addresses into the GPS on their phone and head towards home," Lore said. Wal-Mart compensates the employees for it but declined to elaborate how it works. The discount retailer said the test has only been in progress for a month but so far "hundreds" of deliveries have been completed in two locations in New Jersey and one in Arkansas. So far, "the response from associates and customers has been great," Lore said. Its locations and labor — some 4,700 U.S. stores with 1.3 million employees — are quite an asset that Lore has been working on further integrating with its digital operations. The retailer says 90 percent of the country's population live within 10 miles of a Walmart store. While the retailer does not provide a delivery cost breakdown, it's the last leg — commonly referred to as the "last mile" — that is the most expensive when it comes to fulfilling and shipping online orders. Consultant group McKinsey & Company estimates "the last mile" can sometimes be more than half of an item's total delivery cost. Last month, Wal-Mart Stores said it would offer shoppers a discount for 10,000 online-only orders that are picked up by shoppers in store rather than delivered to their homes. The discount, Marc Lore said, is "meant to be equivalent to what the last-mile delivery costs are," which in most cases averages to about a 4 percent discount per item. The store pickup option saves Wal-Mart delivery costs, which it passes on to shoppers in the form of discounts, but the new employees-as-delivery-service test does not offer shoppers a discount. Wal-Mart said the benefit is that most orders are delivered the next day.

Comments aAFont Size Wal-Mart Stores Inc. unveiled a new convenience store in Rogers earlier this year, opening the doors to a building that features an expanded selection of food and drinks. The 2,500-square-foot building is the company's latest fuel station and convenience store concept, according to Ramnik Narsey, a senior vice president for Wal-Mart's U.S. fuel business. The retailer, based in Bentonville, spent about a year developing plans before building the convenience stores in Rogers and Crowley, Texas. The Rogers store, which is at the entrance of a Wal-Mart Supercenter, replaces a kiosk previously at the existing fuel station. The kiosk was manned by an employee and offered a small selection of convenience staples like candy, chips and soft drinks. But Narsey said feedback led the retailer to consider larger store formats the past few years. "Customers were asking us, 'Why don't you offer more?'" Narsey said. Wal-Mart has tested and considered a handful of convenience options in addition to the kiosks, but Narsey believes Wal-Mart has found a good fit with its latest pilot. The Rogers store offers a hot food bar where customers can grab paninis, nachos, hot dogs or sausages. There is a walk-in cooler stocked with domestic, imported and craft beer. The store also includes a soft-serve ice cream machine with multiple flavors. Wal-Mart has even stocked the store with a few grocery staples like milk, eggs, frozen meals and pizzas. In addition, pre-made sandwiches and salads are available. Wal-Mart hopes the variety will lead to more sales. Narsey said value and speed is the goal, offering customers the chance to grab a variety of items quickly and at Wal-Mart prices. "We'll do a little bit of fine-tuning as we go along and get feedback from customers about what they like, what they think we could do better," Narsey said. "But I think this is about the comfortable size." Wal-Mart is hoping to make a bigger push in a convenience store space, which enjoyed a strong year, according to the Association for Convenience and Fuel Retailing. The trade organization published the results of a survey in January in which 68 percent of convenience retailers said their fuel sales increased in 2016 and 63 percent said food sales increased. Brian Yarbrough, a retail analyst for Edward Jones, said it's difficult for convenience stores to make money on fuel. But Yarbrough said there's a good opportunity on the food side for Wal-Mart. "It's a model that works because you have the gas that drives consistent traffic and if you get them in the convenience store, it's very high margin stuff," Yarbrough said. "But for Wal-Mart, does it move the needle? You could spread a couple thousand across the U.S. and it's probably not going to move the needle because Wal-Mart's revenue base is so big." It's not unusual for Wal-Mart to test smaller-store formats. The company began opening Wal-Mart Express stores with an average size of 12,000 square feet in 2011, but decided to close 102 of them across the U.S last year. Wal-Mart also has opened college campus stores ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 square feet, although some of those have closed as well. There are other types of convenience store tests underway. Last year, the retailer began testing a concept called Wal-Mart Pickup and Fuel in Huntsville, Ala., and Thornton, Colo. In addition to fuel stations and convenience selections, customers also can order groceries online and pick them up at those stores the same day. "We're trying that as a combination," Narsey said. "Again, it's all about convenience." Joshua Nicholson, manager of the fuel station in Rogers, said 12 people will work the store. The store is open daily from 5 a.m until midnight, but the gas pumps will operate 24 hours a day. Like any test, Wal-Mart will decide whether to roll the convenience stores out to a larger audience based on results and customer feedback from Rogers and Crowley. But Nicholson believes there's a lot of opportunity in the format the retailer unveiled in Rogers. "We're just going to focus on our customers right now and take that feedback and go with that," Nicholson said. "But I think we'll do pretty well. I think our customers will be impressed."

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Companies Walmart uses virtual reality simulations to train and prepare its staff for Black Friday 200 Walmart Academy sites receive Oculus Rift VR headsets for customer care training. By Oliver Cragg June 1, 2017 17:27 BST Walmart has introduced virtual reality experiences to its employee training schemes.Getty Images US retail giant Walmart is prepping its employees for difficult customers and marquee sales events by strapping its staff into virtual reality training programmes. A total of 200 Walmart Academy training centres dotted around the country will receive an Oculus Rift device and a high-powered PC which will run a series of VR courses designed for trainee managers and customer service staff. With an estimated 150,000 employees graduating from Walmart's proving grounds every year, the training experiences, created by STRIVR Labs, are intended to be short, supplemental guides to customer care, with simple interactive elements. The experiences will be in 360-degree video format, with on-screen prompts tasking trainees with making decisions based on a variety of customer-focused or managerial scenarios - perhaps Walmart is hoping that angry customer avatars are just as demanding in the virtual world. The training schemes will also touch on seasonal sales extravaganzas such as the infamous annual price-slashing holiday, Black Friday. The VR content is expected to last between 30 seconds to five minutes, which is longer than anyone in the real world would want to be near a retail outlet during the manic Black Friday sales. "We don't do anything that is not a good use case for VR," STRIVR's CEO Derek Belcher told TechCrunch. "We have experiences for the lowest-level bagger all the way up to the store management." As well as Walmart, which began trialling STRIVR's VR experiences in January, the VR startup's team has also been involved in virtual training schemes for the University of Arkansas' American football team and has received interest from an unnamed "major" manufacturer from the automotive industry, among others. Belcher also told TechCrunch that Walmart is considering installing a virtual reality headset in its retail stores at a later date. The retail company, which owns UK supermarket chain Asda, boasts over 4,500 stores in the US.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Abha Bhattarai By Abha Bhattarai June 1 Follow @abhabhattarai Walmart plans to sell $25 million worth of Flashlights sneakers this year. (Walmart) FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — These, Walmart executives say, could be the year’s biggest sensation: high-top sneakers with light-up soles. Yes, says Steve Bratspies, Walmart’s chief merchandising officer, stomping on stage in his black Flashlights sneakers, you heard right: The world’s largest retailer is expecting to sell $25 million worth of these sneakers this year. At $19.97 a pop, that’s 1.25 million pairs of shoes. “Like these sneakers?” he asks a crowd of thousands of screaming Walmart employees, two days before the company’s annual shareholder meeting. “Flashlights sneakers. These are a huge trend we’re betting on this year.” And if the company does sell the expected amount, he says, that would be “enough lights for us to light up 48 Rockefeller Center Christmas trees. That’s a lot of lights!” (It’s worth noting that $25 million in flashing-shoe sales would be a drop in the bucket for Walmart, making up less than 0.01 percent of the $298.4 billion in U.S. sales it reported last year.) The shoes, which will hit shelves in July, will be available in in four colors: gray, white, black and glittery pink. They come equipped with a USB cord that connects each sneaker with a phone or computer. Once charged, the blue, green and purple LED lights flash for up to eight hours at a time. Similar shoes at “the biggest national brands,” Bratspies said, will sell for about $60 a pair. At Walmart, they’ll cost about one-third of that. “We beat on price, don’t we?” he said. “Every day, we beat on price.” [Walmart is preparing to take on Amazon. But first, parachuting M&M’s.] Then he rattled off more of the company’s biggest selling points: “Sales are up. Traffic is up. Momentum is ours.” Bratspies turned to the company’s employees: “Your job is to create energy and excitement behind every apple, every bicycle, every pair of pajamas, every lightbulb, every single thing you sell in our stores.” Other offerings to hit shelves this year include an “instant-cabin tent” that can be set up in about one minute. It comes with LED lights and a screen porch. (Although when employees tried to set it up on stage, it took well over a minute, before Bratspies declared, “I think it’s broken, actually. We’ve got a problem. Trust me, it’s really good.”) But no matter, he said: “Next up, we’ve got a sweet treat that’s already a huge hit in our stores.” Bags of caramel M&Ms parachuted down from the ceiling. Employees went wild: “Wow, wow!” “Oh my god!” “Come to mama, baby, come to mama!” Then the other highlights: A cooler that holds ice up to five days, gallons of glue that sell for $12.88 (of which Walmart plans to sell 7 million units), and pool floats shaped like bacon, cupcakes and emoji smileys. “These things are fun and already flying off shelves,” Bratspies said as the crowd cheered. “We’ve got ducks, swans. All at a really great Walmart price.” Read more: Meet Marriott’s longest-standing employee: A 79-year-old omelet-maker A man is suing Hershey for ‘under-filling’ his box of Whoppers The maker of Bud Light is investing $2 billion to make its beer ‘more sophisticated’ business business true Please provide a valid email address.

WAMPLER Customers park under an awning to pick up groceries May 3 at Wal-Mart on Pleasant Grove in Rogers. Comments aAFont Size NWA Democrat-Gazette/J.T. WAMPLER Stephany Ponce of Springdale selects grocery items May 3 at Wal-Mart on Pleasant Grove in Rogers. Ponce is a persona... Stephany Ponce scans the cooler holding eggs, picks up a carton and checks for cracks. Finding none, she gently places the carton in her basket and moves on to the next item on her list. Ponce fills several grocery lists daily not for herself, but in her role as a personal shopper at Wal-Mart. "I check expiration dates and look for damaged packages," she said recently at the store on Pleasant Crossing Boulevard in Rogers. "We make sure we are giving customers the best product." Wal-Mart's personal shoppers are an integral part of the retailer's rapidly expanding online grocery program, said Ellen Martinez, regional e-commerce manager. Customers can shop online and pick up their order curbside in more than 100 markets and 600 stores nationwide. Martinez said the company is looking at adding 500 more stores to the program this year. Moving online Grocery pickup is not new for Wal-Mart. The company's first online ordering test started in 2011 in San Jose, Calif., before expanding to Denver in 2013. A 15,000-square-foot prototype opened at the intersection of Walton Boulevard and J Street in Bentonville in 2014. The site's only function is grocery pickup and is still in operation. Martinez, who once managed the Bentonville pickup store, said the standalone site continues to offer a unique perspective, but adding pickup locations at stores is a way to merge Wal-Mart's physical operations with the digital side of the business. A study by iVend Retail, an omnichannel retail management software vendor, reports 57.5 percent of all shoppers use an omnichannel service, but only 31.6 percent describe it as being a smooth process. Omnichannel is when a shopper uses multiple methods of shopping, such as buying online or via the telephone and picking up in the store. "We have several tests going on," Martinez said. "We want to meet customer demand in every area." The iVend survey said 29.2 percent of customers said convenience was the biggest reason to shop online and pickup in a store. Convenience is what made Tabatha Miller a loyal Wal-Mart pickup customer. The Fayetteville mother of three children ages 4 and younger started using the service as soon as she moved to Northwest Arkansas from the East Coast in 2015. "Literally, grocery pickup is one of my favorite things about Northwest Arkansas. My friends at home are so jealous," she said. The Millers use the service at least twice a week, and some months avoid having to step into a store, she said. "We can manager our grocery budget more efficiently. We are more intentional about our grocery shopping and spend $100 or less," she said. Ponce, who spent two years as a cashier before becoming a personal shopper about seven months ago, said the job has helped her be a better shopper. "Before I worked with online grocery pickup I didn't think much about expiration dates," she said. She's also used the online service several times. "It saves so much time. It's quick and easy," she said. "I tell customers the benefits of pickup, so I thought I needed to try it." Click and buy Food Marketing Institute and Nielsen report in the "Digitally Engaged Food Shopper" analysis that 23 percent of American households buy food online. The report predicts that could reach 70 percent in 10 years, with 60 percent of those shoppers spending more than 25 percent of their food dollars online. "The grocery business truly is at a digital tipping point, where every aspect of the shopper's journey will soon be influenced by digital, and increasingly enabled by digital platforms," Chris Morley, president of U.S. Buy at Nielsen, said in the report. The report says online grocery shopping could quintuple in the next 10 years, reaching $100 billion by 2025. A report by Citi Research shows Wal-Mart is "best positioned" to capitalize on online grocery among major food retailers. Citi analysts report Wal-Mart's price-cutting strategy helped build market share. Wal-Mart's personal shoppers do three rounds of collecting groceries daily, filling orders for four to eight customers at a time, Ponce said. Items are scanned with a hand-held device to make sure it is the correct product and placed into the order's basket. Items are marked with stickers identifying "fragile," "substitution," "alcohol" and "heavy" as needed. Jun Rasphuomy, eCommerce assistant store manager at the Rogers store, said alcohol sales are dependent on local laws and always require identification at pickup. Tobacco products are not available to be picked up. "When you think grocery pickup, most people think of just groceries," he said in an email. "This is not the case. Things such as fishing rods, basketballs, exercise equipment and air/water filters are available for online grocery pickup." The number of personal shoppers varies by store, but typically range from nine to 30 depending on the day and volume of orders, Rasphuomy said. Martinez said employees are trained to look for the best products, specially in produce and meat departments. "It's about building trust with the customer and that takes dedication. I think we meet that goal," she said. The program improves the store's overall performance, she said, because personal shoppers are looking every day at items across the store. "If the in-store stock is good, I've seen it go from good to excellent," Martinez said. "And customers see that." Rasphuomy said consistency helps build a good reputation. About 90 percent of online grocery shoppers are repeat customers, he said. "If there is an issue, we offer a hassle-free refund/replacement for any bad produce or meat products," he said. Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said earlier this year at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2017 Consumer and Retail Technology Conference the company needs to make customers' worlds simpler. "Technology in particular is being used to get rid of friction, make things simpler and easier, and customers just expect that as a company, you're innovating all the time and making things more enjoyable for them," McMillon said.

Walmart filed the patent on 23 November last year, and the US Patent and Trademark Office (UPTO) published it on 25 May. With the delivery model described in the patent, the drone – or the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) – will drop off the parcel/payload into an automated locker / delivery box, which will open in response to a message validating the identity of the UAV. The key advantages of using this sort of automated delivery box, rather than having the drones drop parcels on someone’s front lawn, is that is both safer and more secure. The patent also includes references to using blockchain technology for extra security and to track shipments that are fragile or temperature sensitive.     Source: USPTO Tags: Americas, Innovation, Parcel Print Send to friend Bookmark Save Leave a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Ginny Marvin on June 1, 2017 at 10:48 am More Kleiner Perkins venture partner Mary Meeker released her annual Internet Trends report on Wednesday. In total, the report comprises 355 PowerPoint slides and covers online trends in sectors ranging from media and healthcare to China and India. Here we look at key trends in retail and e-commerce: 1. A withering brick-and-mortar landscape as Amazon/e-commerce grows. Amazon in particular is proving to be a formidable foe, inflicting deep wounds on brick-and-mortar retail chains. “Store closings may break a 20-year record” according to a 2017 estimate by Credit Suisse (slide 72). That report estimates that more than 8,600 brick-and-mortar stores may close in 2017. “Barely a quarter into 2017, year-to-date retail store closings have already surpassed those of 2008,” according to Credit Suisse. Macy’s, J.C. Penney, Bebe, Staples and nearly a dozen other retailers have announced store closings. Online sales grew again in 2016, rising 15 percent year over year (slide 76). Parcel deliveries in the US have been steadily increasing over the past six years and rose 9 percent year over year in 2016 (slide 65). 2. Walmart is sprinting to catch up online. The brick-and-mortar behemoth Walmart, which has had relatively lackluster impact online despite past investments, rapidly accelerated its e-commerce efforts this past year. It acquired Jet.com in August 2016, and already this year it has bought or invested in Shoebuy, JD.com, Moosejaw and Modcloth.com. Walmart’s e-commerce revenue grew 63 percent year over year last quarter. (slide 74) 3. The new retail is mobile-informed. Retail isn’t dead-dead, it’s just evolving. Meeker points to Warby Parker (slide 73), Lowe’s augmented-reality experiment with Google to help consumers locate items in-store (slide 70), and Amazon itself opening up self-checkout retail stores (slide 72) as examples of ways retail is evolving to meet the needs and expectations of mobile-enabled consumers. 4. Retailers are taking advantage of online-offline feedback loops. Other examples of hybrid online-offline commerce experiences include MM.LaFleur, which offers both online and in-store personal shopping advice (slide 63) and incorporates that information back into its bento-box-style e-commerce operation, and shirt retailer UNTUCKit, which incorporates online and offline feedback into its brand experiences (slide 60). 5. Location-driven advertising is becoming more targeted & accountable. Location-targeted ads from Google (slide 25), Nextdoor and xAd (slide 29) and Uber’s in-app ads powered by Foursquare (slide 28) are examples of how ad delivery and the ability to track outcomes are changing the dynamic between online marketing and offline commerce. Google has tracked more than 5 billion in-store visits globally, and just last week introduced its store purchases tracking solution to link ad clicks to physical transactions. Check out the full report for more insights. The focus on digital advertising begins on slide 10.

Whole Foods still faces a number of challenges that aren't reflected in its stock price. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Jun 1, 2017 at 8:51AM Shares of Whole Foods Market, Inc. (NASDAQ:WFM) aren't looking as fresh as they once were. The one-time stock market darling is still trading down nearly 50% from its 2013 peak, and much of the recent news has been negative. The organic grocer reported its seventh straight quarter of declining comparable sales last month and expects same-store sales to fall for the full year. Profits for the year are also expected to drop. Image source: Whole Foods. It's clear what's going on. Traditional supermarket chains including Kroger (NYSE:KR), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), and Costco have horned in on Whole Foods' traditional strength: organic and natural foods. Kroger's Simple Truth brand, which launched in 2012, reached $1 billion in sales in just two years, and the company now has more than $10 billion in annual sales of organic and natural products.  Wal-Mart, meanwhile, has been devoting more space to selling fresh food such as produce and has been aggressively lowering prices, and Costco is the nation's largest seller of organic food, according to some metrics. Whole Foods has struggled to respond to this renewed competition, despite a change in its management structure and efforts to lower prices, launch a loyalty program, and open a new discount banner, Whole Foods 365.  While some investors, such as activist hedge fund Jana Partners, seem to think Whole Foods offers opportunity after the recent stock slide, there are reasons to think its performance will continue to be challenged.   Competition is only increasing It's not only entrenched players that are on the move in the grocery space. While Wal-Mart's efforts to expand its online grocery-pickup program to nearly 1,000 stores is winning plaudits from customers, new competitors are also jumping into the giant $800 billion U.S grocery market. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is accelerating its grocery ambitions, too. It expanded its Amazon Fresh delivery service to a number of new cities last year, is testing the cashier-less Amazon Go convenience-store concept, and just made its first two Amazon Fresh Pickup locations open to the public. Amazon has already upended a number of retail sectors and is focused on penetrating the grocery market. Expect increasing investments from the e-commerce giant. Another entrant expected to threaten a swath of the industry is German grocery giant Lidl, which will open its first stores in the U.S. in June. Lidl has already squeezed Wal-Mart subsidiary Asda in the U.K. and plans to open as many as 600 stores in the United States. Known for rock-bottom prices, Lidl isn't a direct competitor of Whole Foods, but it's likely to put more price pressure on the industry, which could carry over to Whole Foods.  Its competitive advantage isn't coming back Ten years ago, Whole Foods was dominating the organic-food sector it pioneered, posting double-digit comparable-sales growth. The company's brand and unique approach to groceries gave it a competitive advantage, allowing it to charge higher prices and reap a higher margin. But the mainstreaming of organic food brought increased competition from traditional grocers, alternative concepts such as Trader Joe's, and farmers' markets and community-supported agriculture programs.  Whole Foods still has an edge in gourmet, specialty, and prepared foods that its customers seek out, but when it comes to organic produce and other such goods that used to set Whole Foods apart, that difference no longer exists. The advantage it once had isn't coming back. The stock is still overpriced Despite Whole Foods' manifest challenges, the stock is still overpriced compared with its peers. Whole Foods trades at a P/E ratio of 28 today, and that value is likely to expand as profits decline. Kroger, meanwhile, carries a P/E of 15; Wal-Mart trades at a P/E of 18, and Supervalu has a P/E of just 10. While its traditionally higher margin may be some justification for the premium, investors seem to be betting on Jana Partners' ability to engineer a sale or a turnaround in the business. With a market cap of $11 billion, Whole Foods won't have an easy time finding a buyer, and sales continue to decline despite a number of initiatives to turn around the business. Considering the stock's valuation and the company's problems, the stock is likely to head lower. John Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Prosecutors identified the teenager as Eliza Wasni from Chicago, who appeared in court for a bond hearing in Skokie, Illinois . The prosecutors called the act “heinous” and “not provoked in any manner.” On Wednesday afternoon, a Cook County judge ruled that Wasni would be held without bail in the stabbing of the Uber driver Grant Nelson, 34, of Wilmette, Illinois. Read: Uber Lawsuit: Company Fails To Accommodate People With Disabilities According to Cook County State's Attorney Michelle Cunningham, Wasni had taken two other Uber rides before Nelson picked her up from a Walmart store in Skokie, when she was carrying a machete and a knife. Two minutes later, Wasni stabbed Nelson from the backseat inside the car. Nelson then managed to pull over his car and ran into a condo apartment building lobby where he banged the lobby doors and screamed “Help me, help me. I'm going to die.” Following this, the residents called 911, Cunningham said. The teenager tried to escape in Nelson’s vehicle however; she hit a median and then left the car and ran on foot. Police officers found a blood trail that led them to the wounded Uber driver. Nelson was taken to a hospital nearby where he later succumbed to his injuries. Wasni was found crouching behind an office building’s air conditioning unit that was quite far from the crime scene. Cunningham said that the officers requested her to put down her weapons but she refused to do so. Then one of the officers tased her and took her into custody. Police officers were able to track the last rider on the Uber driver’s phone in order to see that “Eliza” was the last customer who rode the vehicle. Prosecutors said that the surveillance footage from Walmart showed the teenager left the store without paying for the machete and the knife. Prosecutors also stated that Wasni violated Uber’s terms and conditions, which mention that customers must be at least 18 years old to take a ride. Wasni only confirmed her name during the bond hearing. Her public defender told the court that she attends Taft High School in Chicago and lives with a single mother. Read: Indiana Teen, Who Was Focus Of Amber Alert, Charged In Mother's Stabbing Death An Uber spokeswoman said in a statement Wednesday that the company is “heartbroken by the loss of one of our partners, Grant Nelson. Our deepest sympathies and prayers are with his family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time.” Outside the courtroom, Nelson's brother, Todd Nelson, called him “the most gentle, kind person. He never hurt anyone. He was good to animals, he was good to children.” His sister, Alexandra Nelson, also added that the family hopes “justice will happen,” condemning the attack and called it “horrifying and maddening.” “He was not a vindictive person,” Alexandra added. “He was not a cruel person. He didn't deserve this fate.” The victim’s autopsy results are still pending. The authorities stated that this was the first homicide in Lincolnwood since 2006, when a man killed his brother over a dispute regarding domestic issues.

Prosecutors identified the teenager as Eliza Wasni from Chicago, who appeared in court for a bond hearing in Skokie, Illinois . The prosecutors called the act “heinous” and “not provoked in any manner.” On Wednesday afternoon, a Cook County judge ruled that Wasni would be held without bail in the stabbing of the Uber driver Grant Nelson, 34, of Wilmette, Illinois. Read: Uber Lawsuit: Company Fails To Accommodate People With Disabilities According to Cook County State's Attorney Michelle Cunningham, Wasni had taken two other Uber rides before Nelson picked her up from a Walmart store in Skokie, when she was carrying a machete and a knife. Two minutes later, Wasni stabbed Nelson from the backseat inside the car. Nelson then managed to pull over his car and ran into a condo apartment building lobby where he banged the lobby doors and screamed “Help me, help me. I'm going to die.” Following this, the residents called 911, Cunningham said. The teenager tried to escape in Nelson’s vehicle however; she hit a median and then left the car and ran on foot. Police officers found a blood trail that led them to the wounded Uber driver. Nelson was taken to a hospital nearby where he later succumbed to his injuries. Wasni was found crouching behind an office building’s air conditioning unit that was quite far from the crime scene. Cunningham said that the officers requested her to put down her weapons but she refused to do so. Then one of the officers tased her and took her into custody. Police officers were able to track the last rider on the Uber driver’s phone in order to see that “Eliza” was the last customer who rode the vehicle. Prosecutors said that the surveillance footage from Walmart showed the teenager left the store without paying for the machete and the knife. Prosecutors also stated that Wasni violated Uber’s terms and conditions, which mention that customers must be at least 18 years old to take a ride. Wasni only confirmed her name during the bond hearing. Her public defender told the court that she attends Taft High School in Chicago and lives with a single mother. Read: Indiana Teen, Who Was Focus Of Amber Alert, Charged In Mother's Stabbing Death An Uber spokeswoman said in a statement Wednesday that the company is “heartbroken by the loss of one of our partners, Grant Nelson. Our deepest sympathies and prayers are with his family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time.” Outside the courtroom, Nelson's brother, Todd Nelson, called him “the most gentle, kind person. He never hurt anyone. He was good to animals, he was good to children.” His sister, Alexandra Nelson, also added that the family hopes “justice will happen,” condemning the attack and called it “horrifying and maddening.” “He was not a vindictive person,” Alexandra added. “He was not a cruel person. He didn't deserve this fate.” The victim’s autopsy results are still pending. The authorities stated that this was the first homicide in Lincolnwood since 2006, when a man killed his brother over a dispute regarding domestic issues.

According to police, the teen wandered around a Skokie, Illinois Walmart and stole a knife and machete, a crime allegedly caught on surveillance cameras. Then, the teen allegedly used the weapons to fatally stab her Uber driver, 34-year-old Grant Nelson. As ABC 7 reports, Nelson was Eliza Wasni’s third Uber driver of the day, picking her up after her alleged shoplifting spree. Investigators say that at 1:12 a.m., Wasni took an Uber to the Des Plaines train station. She then took a second Uber from the train station to the Walmart and arranged for a third Uber to pick her up from the store. On Wednesday, 16-year-old Wasni was charged as an adult with first-degree murder. Not surprisingly, she was denied bail after appearing in bond court where prosecutors called the vicious stabbing attack “heinous and unprovoked.” According to Cook County prosecutors, victim Grant Nelson had the fatal misfortune to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. He unwittingly picked up the teen, unaware that she had violent intentions. After Eliza Wasni got into the back seat of his vehicle, prosecutors allege that the teen repeatedly stabbed the driver from her position behind him. According to Assistant State’s Attorney Michelle Cunningham, Nelson attempted to flee from his unlikely attacker by jumping out of his car and running for help at a nearby building. “The victim runs to the lobby door and is heard banging and screaming, ‘Help me, help me, I’m going to die.” The Wilmette Patch reports that after brutally stabbing her Uber driver within minutes of getting in his car, Wansi attempted to flee the scene of the carnage. She allegedly stole his vehicle and attempted to drive away. Her escape was thwarted when she hit a median. Prosecutors say that Eliza Wansi then tried to get away on foot, stripping off her bloody shirt and attempting to evade police in just her bra and leggings. Eliza Wasni held without bail in murder of Uber driver in Lincolnwood – Chicago Sun… https://t.co/MyIIVn6jZ3 #Uber — mediat technology (@mediat_tech) May 31, 2017 Police were alerted to the horrific crime when they received 911 calls that a man was screaming for help in the area. When they arrived on scene at 3:22 a.m, Wansi was shirtless and still armed with the stolen knife and machete. According to officers, they repeatedly demanded that she drop the weapons, but she refused. Ultimately, Eliza Wansi was Tased at the scene. First responders found Grant Nelson hiding in a 2014 Hyundai Sonata, he immediately identified himself as an Uber driver who had been stabbed by his white female passenger and that she was likely a juvenile.

Unfortunately, doctors were unable to save his life. When Eliza Wansi appeared in court on Wednesday, Cook County Judge Michael J. Hood called the senseless murder a “random act of violence” before denying the teen bond. Judge Hood also pointed out in court that Wasni and Nelson didn’t know each other before attack, which he called “extremely violent in nature.” Grant Nelson,34, ate dinner with his family before he was stabbed and killed while driving for a ride sharing app. @cbschicago pic.twitter.com/xFfcFFGs0y — Charlie De Mar (@CharlieDeMar) May 30, 2017 As Heavy reports, Grant Nelson’s sister has spoken out about her brother’s character in the aftermath of his violent murder. According to Alex Nelson, her Uber driving brother was an animal lover and all around “good person.” Needless to say, Nelson’s sister says that Grant didn’t deserve the fate allegedly meted out to him by 16-year-old Eliza Wansi. “He had probably the most extensive collection of classical music of anyone I’ve ever met in life… I want people to know Grant was a good person. He was not a vindictive person. He was not a cruel person. He didn’t deserve this fate.” While Eliza Wasni has been charged with first-degree murder and as an adult for the role she allegedly played in her Uber driver’s senseless and brutal slaying, the teen will not face the death penalty if she is convicted, as Illinois has not been a “death penalty state” since 2011. The maximum sentence Wasni could receive for the stabbing is life in prison.

I’m going to die’: 16-year-old girl accused of killing Uber driver with knife, machete Posted 7:56 PM, May 31, 2017, by Tribune Media Wire, Updated at 06:29AM, June 1, 2017 Facebook Twitter Pinterest Reddit LinkedIn Email Please enable Javascript to watch this video LINCOLNWOOD, Ill. -- A 16-year-old girl charged with killing her Uber driver was captured on Walmart surveillance video "walking nonchalantly throughout the store" holding a knife in one hand and a machete in another, prosecutors said. Authorities say Eliza Wasni later used those weapons kill 34-year-old Grant Nelson in Lincolnwood, Illinois. That's just one of the details that Cook County State's Attorney Michelle Cunningham revealed in a news conference Wednesday after Wasni appeared in court on first-degree murder charges. She is being held without bond for allegedly killing Nelson, of Wilmette. According to Cunningham, Wasni hailed the first of three Uber drivers at about 1:25 a.m. Tuesday, and was driven to a train station in Des Plaines. At 2:18 a.m., a second Uber driver took her from the train station to a Walmart store. That's when Cunningham says the teen removed a knife and a machete from their packaging at the store and walked around holding them. Then she left Walmart with the knife and machete, without paying, and was not stopped by any personnel, Cunningham said. The third Uber driver, Nelson, picked up Wasni in his Hyundai Sonata a few blocks west of the Walmart. About two minutes after Wasni got in the car, Cunningham says Nelson was stabbed by Wasni from the backseat. Cunnningham says Nelson was able to maneuver his car into a condo apartment building driveway near Lincoln and Touhy. Cunningham said he got out of the car and was heard banging and screaming at the lobby door saying "Help me! Help me! I'm going to die!" That's when residents called 911. Cunningham says Wasni tried to flee in Nelson's vehicle but she hit a median near the scene. Officers say she left the car, which was covered in blood, running in the middle of Lincoln Avenue and fled on foot. Cunningham says police found Nelson laying in the grass near the scene. He told officers that he was an Uber driver and that his passenger had attacked him. He was then transported to an area hospital where he later died from his injuries. According to Cunningham, another group of officers later found Wasni crouched behind an office building's air conditioning unit not too far from the scene. She had the machete in one hand and a knife in another. When she wouldn't drop the weapons at the officers' requests, one of the officers tazed her and she was taken into custody. Autopsy results of the victim are still pending. Walmart did not immediately offer a statement regarding the incident.

Share story By ANNE D'INNOCENZIO The Associated Press HOBOKEN, N.J. — Even after an online-spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world’s largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon’s Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart’s U.S. online operations, says he’s confident about the company’s momentum and that there’s plenty of room for it to thrive.

It’s about innovating. And it’s a very big market.” He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore led Wal-Mart’s acquisitions of specialty-online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he’s still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares for its annual meeting Friday, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal-Mart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn’t putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. “If anything, the gap was widening,” Spitz said. “Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question.” Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon’s relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon’s path toward Wal-Mart’s 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is “reasonable.” If Lore is worried, he doesn’t acknowledge it. “We don’t think specifically about Prime at all,” he said. “We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store.” Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon’s stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it’s testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items and there’s no need for shoppers to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery-pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick them up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there’s no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. “We’ve had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it’s never changed our approach,” Amazon says. “We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about — low prices, vast selection and fast delivery.” Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet’s “smart-cart” technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it’s helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart’s website over the next few years. “We want to sell them everything,” Lore said. “The assortment is growing fast,” he said. “But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress.” ANNE D'INNOCENZIO View Comments No personal attacks or insults, no hate speech, no profanity.

Trendy independent firms can face a customer backlash when their founders sell to a big corporation. But many of these brands keep their cool and cachet - although it requires careful management. When the Camden Town Brewery was bought in 2015 by Ab InBev, the world's biggest beer firm, rival craft brewery BrewDog published a lengthy blog attacking the move. It accused Camden and other small brewers of selling out to "mega corporations, the ones who destroyed... and commoditised beer". It also said it would stop selling Camden beer at its BrewDog pubs, because it didn't want to put money in Ab InBev's pockets. But in April this year BrewDog raised a few eyebrows when it sold a minority stake to US private equity firm TSG Consumer Partners for £213m. Does this mean BrewDog itself sold out? "First of all, no-one has taken over BrewDog, we're still majority-owned by myself and Martin Dickie," co-founder James Watt tells the BBC. Consumer backlash As part of the deal, TSG agreed "100%" to protect the firm's independence and the way the beer is made, he says. "This deal gives us the firepower to compete globally with the mega beer corporations and their faux 'craft' beers, whilst remaining fiercely independent." From craft beer firms to organic food businesses, ethical fashion labels to beauty brands, many small firms have sold up to bigger ones only to be accused of selling out. Image copyright BrewDog Image caption BrewDog founders Martin Dickie and James Watt have promised never to sell up to a corporate brewer But is such criticism fair, and why do small businesses sell up in the first place? Mark Ritson, a professor of marketing at Melbourne Business School, says most consumers are "completely ignorant" about who owns their favourite brands. But in a small percentage of cases it can create bad publicity because the firms involved are "so contradictory". This happened when retailer Walmart acquired the trendy US online fashion firm ModCloth in March. ModCloth, which sells vintage-style clothes for women, had built a loyal following of socially liberal customers who identified with its brand values. But many of them thought Walmart was an unsuitable new owner, questioning its business practices with regards to workers' rights. Walmart tells the BBC it has invested billions of dollars in training and higher wages for its workers. And at the time of the deal, it stressed that ModCloth would continue to operate as a standalone business after the deal and get help to grow. However, that didn't stop customers complaining on a blog on the ModCloth website. Comments such as "congratulations, you have lost my business forever" and "today marks the death of ModCloth" sum up the reaction. Not so Innocent? According to Prof Ritson, the negative response to such deals is often more about perception than reality. He gives the example of Coca Cola, which in 2010 took a controlling stake in Innocent, the British smoothie-maker famed for its natural ingredients and quirky branding. Image copyright Innocent Image caption Innocent claims its values have "absolutely not" changed after Coca Cola took over in 2010 Like ModCloth, Innocent's founders stressed the firm would retain its values, in this case a commitment to natural, healthy food. But the deal had its critics. "You had the contradiction of this mass, American, sugary brand with the British, healthy brand, and it did diminish the firm in the eyes of many of its loyal followers," Mr Ritson says. But seven years on, Innocent claims its values have "absolutely not" changed. Innocent says it has increased sales across Europe by harnessing Coca Cola's expertise and resources. Turnover rose from £114m in 2009, when the US giant first took a minority stake, to £247m in 2015, Innocent's most recent audited accounts. "Coca Cola has remained hands-off and let us get on with running, growing and developing Innocent in an Innocent way," says a spokesperson. Phil Howard, an associate professor at the Department of Community Sustainability at Michigan State University, says it is understandable that small firms should want to be bought up "as the system favours bigger firms". Investors in small firms often want an early pay-back, while the costs of expanding a business can be heavy. Image copyright Ben and Jerrys Image caption After buying Ben & Jerry’s, Unilever set up an independent board to protect the ice cream firm's core values However, he says that while founders will see sales growth and "get a pay-off", most are "deluded" if they think their values will be protected. "If you talk to founders three or so years after the acquisition - you find most are disillusioned," he says. Buyer's remorse William Kendal, one a group of investors who took over Green & Blacks in 1999 - and was also its chief executive - says he now regrets selling the ethical chocolate brand to Cadbury in 2005. The entrepreneur tells the BBC the deal was driven by a desire to harness Cadbury's reach - particularly in the US - but that the brand did not take off in America as planned. He says the firm had regularly spoken out about political issues - such as whether the UK should adopt the euro and the limitations of the Fairtrade system - but Cadbury put a stop to that. "We were a campaigning brand, and occasionally we put people's noses out of joint, but that was part of the marketing. Image copyright Sim Photography Image caption William Kendall says, with hindsight, he could have done more with Green & Black's "But Cadbury were nervous about that and it watered down the personality of the brand." Mondelez, which now owns Green & Black's, says it is committed to the brand's founding philosophy of delivering "great tasting, ethically-sourced chocolate" and has invested significantly in its growth. Natalie Berg, an analyst at Planet Retail, says takeovers of craft brands can work, as long as the acquiring firm takes a hands-off approach. She cites Ben and Jerry's, the US ice cream firm bought by Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever for $200m in 2000.

Nine-month stretch: The rise of prenatal exercise classes Can't find the right handbag? Just design it yourself Why you need to question your hippo boss From its founding in 1978, the firm prided itself on its environmentalism, ethical ingredients and outspoken social advocacy - and since Unilever took over little has changed, say experts. This is partly because from the outset, Unilever agreed to establish an "external board" charged with overseeing Ben & Jerry's culture and social mission. "Some big firms have core competence for buying and maintaining small brands, and some don't," says Prof Ritson. Nonetheless, Mr Kendall's advice to small brands that are growing fast, but feeling the urge to sell, is to hold on. "Cadbury didn't do a bad job with Green & Black's, but in hindsight we could have done a great deal more with it," he says. "It's a British disease - we validate success by the exit rather than achievement of the business."

I’m going to die’: New details revealed in murder of Uber driver in Lincolnwood Posted 3:51 PM, May 31, 2017, by WGN Web Desk, Updated at 10:27AM, June 1, 2017 Share Update: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Please enable Javascript to watch this video LINCOLNWOOD, Ill. -- A 16-year-old girl was captured on Walmart surveillance video "walking nonchalantly throughout the store" holding a knife in one hand and a machete in another. Authorities say Eliza Wasni used those weapons kill her Uber driver in Lincolnwood. That's just one of the details that Cook County State's Attorney Michelle Cunningham revealed in a news conference Wednesday after Wasni appeared in court on first-degree murder charges. She is being held without bond for killing Grant Nelson, 34, of Wilmette. According to Cunningham, Wasni was picked up by the first of three Uber drivers at about 1:25 a.m. Tuesday. She was driven to a train station in Des Plaines. At 2:18 a.m., a second Uber driver took her from Des Plaines to a Walmart located at 3606 Touhy. That's when Cunningham says the teen removed a knife and a machete from their packaging at the store and walked around holding them. Then she left Walmart with the knife and machete, without paying, and was not stopped by any personnel, Cunningham said. The third Uber driver, Nelson, picked up Wasni in his Hyundai Sonata a few blocks west of the Walmart. About two minutes after Wasni got in the car, Cunningham says Nelson was stabbed by Wasni from the backseat. Cunnningham says Nelson was able to maneuver his car into a condo apartment building driveway near Lincoln and Touhy. Cunningham said he got out of the car and was heard banging and screaming at the lobby door saying "Help me! Help me! I'm going to die!" That's when residents called 911. Cunningham says Wasni tried to flee in Nelson's vehicle but she hit a median near the scene. Officers say she left the car, which was covered in blood, running in the middle of Lincoln Avenue and fled on foot. Cunningham says police found Nelson laying in the grass near the scene. He told officers that he was an Uber driver and that his white, female passenger had attacked him. He was then transported to an area hospital where he later died from his injuries. According to Cunningham, another group of officers later found Wasni crouched behind an office building's air conditioning unit not too far from the scene. She had the machete in one hand and a knife in another. When she wouldn't drop the weapons at the officers' requests, one of the officers tazed her and she was taken into custody. Autopsy results of the victim are still pending.

(Jason Ivester/The Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette via AP) FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — It’s before 8 a.m., but here at Bud Walton Arena, named after Walmart’s co-founder, Hanson’s “MMMBop” is blaring through the speakers. Blue lights are flashing to the beat, and thousands of Walmart employees in matching T-shirts (“Happy to help”) are cheering with their arms in the air. There are two days left until Walmart’s shareholders meeting, an annual affair known primarily for its pomp and circumstance, but the festivities are well underway. It’s part pep rally, part pop concert as Walmart executives and employees take the stage to talk about what’s next for the company as it shifts its focus to online shoppers. “There’s never been a more disruptive time in the history of retail,” says Judith McKenna, chief operating officer for Walmart U.S. “We know there is no going back. There is only going forward.” Walmart — which last year had $486 billion in annual revenue, more than three times Amazon.com’s $136 billion — is locked in a tight battle with Amazon for the next generation of consumers. The retail giants — one founded in 1962 and the other in 1994 — are experimenting with new ways to make themselves indispensable to customers at a time when longtime companies such as Macy’s and Sears are fading fast. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) For Walmart, the challenge will be getting Americans to use its website with the same ease and frequency that they now use Amazon, which last year accounted for 33 percent of online U.S. sales. (Walmart accounted for 7.8 percent, behind eBay, according to the research firm Euromonitor.) The average Amazon shopper spends $157 on the site each month, compared with $27 at Walmart, according to a 2016 survey by research firm Mizuho. Walmart is hoping to narrow that gap by adding to its lineup of products and lowering its minimums for free shipping. (Amazon, meanwhile, seems to be moving in the other direction: The company opened its first bricks-and-mortar store two years ago in Seattle and expanded to New York last week.) Walmart last year bought Jet.com for $3.3 billion, and brought on its founder, Marc Lore, as the head of e-commerce. In the months since, Walmart has bought up specialty retailers including ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com. But just as important, executives say, is the company’s collection of 4,600 stores across the country, which account for the bulk of the retailer’s sales. “It’s a physical footprint unrivaled by any company anywhere,” said Greg Foran, president and chief executive of Walmart U.S. “The convergence of digital and physical gives customers choice on how, when and where they purchase and receive their items.” To that end, the company has begun offering discounts to online shoppers who pick up their purchases at Walmart stores. It has also begun offering free two-day shipping on orders over $35, down from $49. (Amazon has followed suit, first lowering its minimum requirement from $49 to $35, and most recently, to $25. On Friday, more than 16,000 shareholders, Walmart employees and others will gather in this arena to vote on the nomination of 11 board directors, including Walmart chief executive Doug McMillon and Marissa Mayer, chief executive of Yahoo. Shareholders will also vote on pay packages for key employees, including McMillon, who last year was paid $22.4 million in cash and stock awards, and Lore, who received a total of $243.9 million, making him one of the country’s highest-paid executives. The nonbinding vote, part of “say on pay” measures set by Congress, comes as labor groups across the country call on corporations such as Walmart to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour. Other proposals introduced by shareholders include one that would require the board chairman to be “independent of management,” and another that requests an independent director with environmental expertise. (Walmart, for its part, has asked shareholders to vote against these measures.) But on Wednesday morning, the mood was decisively festive. An accounts payable specialist sang the “Star-Spangled Banner.” Actor and former professional football player Terry Crews emceed, and pop singer Julia Michaels performed. Bags of caramel chocolate M&Ms parachuted from the ceiling. A slide show displayed recent company milestones, ranging from a 1.5 percent quarterly increase in comparable store sales, to “we closed at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve.” But the one that got the loudest cheers: “Ecommerce sales up 63 percent.” Read more: A man is suing Hershey for ‘under-filling’ his box of Whoppers The maker of Bud Light is investing $2 billion to make its beer ‘more sophisticated’ Meet Marriott’s longest-standing employee: A 79-year-old omelet-maker business business true Please provide a valid email address.

Brian Bahr, economic development manager for the city, said he believes a convention center would be a boon for the town and the Northwest Arkansas region as a whole, but the project is still in its earliest stages of conception. Bahr’s team, along with Bentonville’s tourism bureau, is researching tax incentive options while “actively looking for investors, which can be hard to find for a project of that scope,” he said. It has been two years since Kalene Griffith, president and CEO of Visit Bentonville, commissioned a feasibility study that recommended the convention center project. At the time, she cited missed opportunities to host large meetings tied to business with Wal-Mart Stores and its suppliers. The study was conducted by Chicago-based consultant Hunden Strategic Partners, and it showed a convention center and hotel would generate hundreds of new jobs, tens of millions in new tax revenue and spark a micro-economy in goods and services. Early estimates showed it would cost about $150 million. Griffith said the proposed center has since gained traction with potential investment partners, including those with similar facilities in other markets. “There’s interest. Our biggest challenge is our need for more incentives for convention center development,” she said. At the state level, investors can receive a 15% sales tax credit if they invest $1 million or more in a facility with at least 75,000 square feet of convention center space. An adjoining hotel cannot be counted toward the total square footage of the tax credit requirement, said Arkansas Economic Development Commission spokesman Scott Hardin. There aren’t any tax breaks or investment assurances in place with the city of Bentonville for such a project, and Bahr said any discussion with the city about potential incentives should wait until a serious investor is on board to help take on the expensive project. A hotel-convention center will require a significant amount of space, and Bahr thinks the development should be built downtown, where commercial square footage is at a premium right now. Kalene Griffith, president and CEO of Visit Bentonville Downtown is where the action is. It’s inviting, and it’s a good place for visitors to the city to be, he said. “Look at all the activity and energy that is taking place in downtown Bentonville right now, between the arts district, the market district, the square.” In addition to convention center space, the project would include a hotel and likely a parking deck, Bahr said. Compact layouts downtown mean the parking needs to be vertical, and that’s about 10 times more expensive, escalating from $1,500 per space for a basic, flat parking lot, up to $15,000 per space for a multi-story parking garage. All in all, it takes work and time to prove the return on investment to potential financiers, Bahr said. Though not downtown, an available site for a large-scale development is along Walton Boulevard just south of the Wal-Mart Home Office. An Oklahoma-based investor, Square Deal Capital Inc. of Oklahoma City, paid $56.8 million last fall to acquire the nine-story Bentonville Plaza office building and 16 additional acres. Included in the deal is 8.68 acres south of Bentonville Plaza. The property once was home to the George Nunnally Chevrolet auto dealership, but is now largely a crumbling parking lot. It has been vacant for nearly six years since Nunnally moved to a new Bentonville location on Moberly Lane in July 2011. To date, Square Deal representatives have not commented on the land purchase, nor have they filed a site plan with the city. MEETINGS MARKET There are two existing convention centers along the Interstate 49 corridor in Northwest Arkansas — the sprawling, 23-acre John Q. Hammons Convention Center in Rogers, connected to the Embassy Suites hotel, and the 13.4-acre Northwest Arkansas Holiday Inn & Convention Center in Springdale. In Bentonville, there are two hotels between 11,000 square feet and 12,000 square feet of meeting space: the 21c Museum Hotel downtown and Four Points by Sheraton on Walton Boulevard. Bahr said the city is unable to host mid-sized conventions, and the proposed facility, in terms of size, would fall between the city’s current offerings and the John Q. Hammons Center, which boasts 125,000 square feet of meeting and convention space. Northwest Arkansas is not the only region looking to tap into the big meetings business. In Jonesboro, two proposed convention centers are being planned.  A 78,000-square-foot, $50 million convention center and 165-room Hyatt Place Hotel near Interstate 555 last year received the blessing of the city’s Advertising & Promotion Commission, which approved a $300,000 investment given in $75,000 installments. However, recent investor issues caused delays in the project, prompting the A&P to take back $71,000 from the first payment until the development is back on track. Chris Keller, CEO of the entity that’s planning the project, is confident a new investor will carry it forward, according to recent reporting from Talk Business & Politics journalist George Jared. A $35 million project is proposed to be built on the Arkansas State University campus. The plans include a 202-bed Embassy Suites hotel, a 40,000-square-foot Red Wolf Convention Center, and a Houlihan’s restaurant. The company behind the project is O’Reilly Hospitality Management of Springfield, Mo., according to recent reports. Both convention centers have targeted 2018 for opening. CONFERENCE ATTENDANCE HIGH Meeting centers in other parts of the state are showing increases or holding steady in revenue and attendance. The Fort Smith Convention and Visitors’ Bureau reported record revenue for the Fort Smith Convention Center in 2016, at $777,519. Looking at the center’s 17 highest producing events, $15 million in spending on meetings at the Fort Smith center generated an estimated $293,715 in sales taxes for the city, according to the visitors’ bureau. In Little Rock, the publicly funded Statehouse Convention Center booked 140,589 convention room nights for 183 events in 2016. Events were down from the previous year at 218, according to the Little Rock Convention & Visitors Bureau’s annual report. CEO Gretchen Hall said the entity so far in 2017 has held onto increased meetings volume caused by a large spike tied to the temporary closing of the Robinson Center venue between 2014 and 2016. The Statehouse Convention Center was built in 1982 and expanded in 1999, the same year the city built the Verizon Arena. Both projects were made possible by a one-cent county-wide sales tax. As far as gauging the need for and feasibility of a large-scale convention center, Hall said, “Every destination’s a little different.” She said Little Rock’s Statehouse Convention Center “has been very well utilized,” and the bureau is now aiming for funding of a large-scale, indoor sports facility recommended in a 2015 study. On a national level, meeting attendance and conference budgets were both up last year, and more than one-quarter of industry professionals expect an increase in meetings bookings for 2017, according to an annual meetings market survey published in March by Convene, the Professional Convention Management Association’s magazine. The key metrics of budget, attendance and exhibitions space are all increasing but at a slower rate than in 2015, according to the report. Of the 200 respondents from throughout North America, 91% expected their budgets to either increase or stay the same during 2017. One-quarter reported earnings of $1 million or more from events and exhibitions.

On Wednesday (May 31), McMillon kicked off the International Associates’ Meeting at Barnhill Arena in Fayetteville and encouraged the company’s 1,500 international employees who were flown to Northwest Arkansas for shareholders week to take home the company culture. “I happen think we’re the good guys and the good girls in this fight,” McMillon said. “Take some of this passion and energy back with you.” Before the meeting, the employees arrived at the arena divided into groups by country, and were singing and dancing, and during the meeting, they also sang and danced to the traditional music of their country after presentations by that country’s executive team. Representing the international division’s 6,300 stores in 28 countries, the employees saw pictures depicting the humble beginnings of the company’s founder Sam Walton, who was born in Kingfisher, Okla., in 1918, and the store he opened in Bentonville in 1950. McMillon explained Walton’s work ethic of servant leadership, saying he shouldn’t ask someone to do a job that he’s not willing to do himself. ‘THE MOST INTERESTING’ Walmart International CEO David Cheesewright echoed the sentiment, and spoke on the opportunity the company offers its employees, noting McMillon was handling boxes in a distribution center when he started with the company. Now, he’s running the biggest company in the world, Cheesewright said. “Where else could that happen?” He said the company’s international division is not the “biggest, but we’re the most interesting by a long, long way.” Unlike the U.S. division, it has 65 store formats, and is in the fourth consecutive year of improving quarterly sales. “I don’t think there’s any other segment that has done that,” he said, giving credit to the work of the store employees. In discussing the company’s impact, he mentioned a U.S. study on how a new Walmart saved each person in the town an average of $3,500. It was like giving each resident a 5% to 6% pay raise, he said. “That’s amazing. That kind of brings it to life for me.” He also discussed the division’s recycling efforts to create zero waste. More than 80% of “everything that comes into our buildings is recycled,” he said. “It was about 60% five years ago.” Employees from Seiyu, Wal-Mart’s brand in Japan, gathered Wednesday in Fayetteville as part of the retailer’s shareholder week. The company is leading the way, and because of its size, other companies are following, such as when it sells low energy light bulbs or high efficiency detergents. Cheesewright encouraged the employees to think about what makes this week special to them and to talk to other employees as they bump into them and ask them what they do. “You’ll find that everybody has a special story,” he said. “But you’ll also find a lot of consistency. You’ll find really competitive people. I don’t think you’ll find many people here who don’t like winning.” INTERNATIONAL MARKETS Also in the meeting, executives of foreign markets discussed business in their division, highlighting the special occasions, seasons and holidays heavily impacting sales. Walmart stores in China serve about 2.4 million customers daily during holidays. Over the past Chinese New Year, Walmart stores there sold 33 million dumplings, and Sam’s Clubs there sold 800 tons of cherries. Also in China, more than 500 million customers shop online, and they can order fresh groceries using their smartphone and have them delivered within an hour. In Chile, the start of its barbecue season is in September, and 27.55 million pounds of meat were sold in the month at its stores, which are celebrating their 60th anniversary. September is also an important month for Mexico, and in the month in 2016, 1.5 million bottles of tequila were sold. In Africa, during its barbecue season, more than 1.1 million pounds of charcoal and 4.5 million meat packs were sold. Easter is an important holiday in the United Kingdom, and $70 million in Easter eggs were sold this past holiday. In Japan, spring is an important season, and sales for a top selling sushi item, the Eho-maki roll, rose 11% for the season over the past year. Japan executives showed an image, depicting the number of rolls sold would stretch 180 miles, or from Oklahoma City to Bentonville. In Canada, the country is celebrating its 150th anniversary, and the company’s private clothing brand, Canadiana, is marking the occasion. COMPANY AWARDS The company also handed out Integrity in Action awards to employees who went above and beyond, such as an Argentina pharmacist who helped to expose a $10 million prescription fraud ring or a United Kingdom pharmacist who helped a customer discover she was a victim of natural gas poisoning. The store of the year was 3658 in Canada. Associates of the year were Jan Ross of store 3004 in Canada, Chunyuan Chen of China and Juan Silva of store 1046 in Argentina. Ross saved a baby’s life by bringing down its body temperature and performing CPR before paramedics arrived. The company named two employees, one from Brazil and the other from South Africa, as part of its Associate Talent Search, and they sang during the meeting.

But would its Lone Star state customers accustomed to driving the family's big SUV to Wal-Mart to stock up on groceries embrace an online option? Apparently, yes. Dallas-Fort Worth is now Wal-Mart's biggest online grocery market in the nation. Some North Texas Wal-Mart stores are filling 900 orders a week. The average for the region is around 500 to 600 orders a week, said Jason Fogerty, Wal-Mart's Dallas area market coach for e-commerce. Wal-Mart just added the service to its first store inside the Dallas city limits at 6185 Retail Road in the Timber Creek Crossing shopping center. "Our customers love it. We're giving them what they want: time with their family," Fogerty said. On the first day it was offered at the Timber Creek location last week, he said, all but one of the customers was new to Wal-Mart's online service. Some Dallas shoppers were going to Garland and Rowlett for curbside pickup, Fogerty said. Wal-Mart grocery curbside service begins in North Texas Wal-Mart was the first to bring online grocery shopping with curbside service to North Texas in October 2015, and now it has expanded curbside pickup to more than 50 stores in Dallas-Fort Worth. Suburban shoppers were the first to have the option of swinging by a store to have a Wal-Mart employee load their groceries into their vehicle that they ordered online. Nationwide, Wal-Mart has expanded it to 500 stores and is adding 600 stores this year. "We think the service is ideal for attracting customers we aren't serving now," said Dallas store manager Tara Barnes, including people from East Dallas neighborhoods, Lake Highlands and students from Southern Methodist University. "Since we're the only Dallas store that has it, we're hoping we'll attract a different customer. Maybe a Tom Thumb shopper who wants this convenience will come here instead," Barnes saud,  She expects the Dallas store to quickly crank up to 40 to 50 orders a day. Ten employees have been trained and assigned exclusively to the service, and another 30 have had enough training to pitch in. Wal-Mart divided a supercenter into eight areas, and the professional shoppers are dispatched with a specially designed cart to accommodate shopping multiple orders at once. Sergio Rivera, the Dallas store's e-commerce manager said the staff received three weeks of training that included filling all the orders one day at a store in Rowlett and Garland. "When the other stores let us run it, we gained a lot of experience." If a size or brand isn't available, employees will pick the larger size or a higher quality at no additional cost, Rivera said. "We also tell the customer about the substitution, and if they don't want it, we can remove it from the receipt." The service is free and orders placed by 10 a.m. can be picked up the same day. Wal-Mart and Amazon are both building their online grocery business. Amazon last month opened two grocery pickup stores in Seattle. In other cities, it's partnered with local supermarkets. Sprouts Farmers Market is Amazon's Dallas grocery source. Kroger started its ClickList curbside service last summer in North Texas. Tom Thumb started online shopping delivery service in Dallas this year. Shoppers have several other options also through Instacart and Google Express. Kroger names which DFW stores will take ClickList online grocery orders After shunning the service in the late 1990s and early 2000s, shoppers today are interested in online grocery shopping as better technology and mobile shopping make it easier. Tanner Kelly, 27, picked up his $180 order last Friday at the Timbercreek Crossing Wal-Mart. He had just moved into a new apartment in Lake Highlands from Rockwall and said he had been adding items on the Walmart.com app all week. "Instead of spending two hours in the store, I just kept adding to my list as I'd think of things," Kelly said. "And now that I'm done moving, I'm coming by for my groceries." Kelly said his mother uses the service so he was used to shopping this way.  Twitter: @MariaHalkias View Comments Tags Retail Share Facebook Twitter Email Print This Story Sponsored Stories Get the Most Important D-FW News in Your Inbox Sign up for our daily email newsletters Get Headlines, Business, SportsDay, and GuideLive.

(Photo courtesy of Village of Lincolnwood) Grace Wong, Susan Berger and Brian L. CoxContact ReporterChicago Tribune A teenage girl from Chicago who has been charged with killing an Uber driver randomly attacked the man with a knife and a machete that she had just stolen from Walmart, authorities say. Eliza Wasni, 16, kept her eyes mostly to the floor Wednesday afternoon as a Cook County judge ordered her held without bail in the killing of Grant Nelson of Wilmette — an act prosecutors called "heinous" and "not provoked in any manner." Prosecutors said Nelson, 34, had picked up Wasni early Tuesday a few blocks from a Walmart in Skokie and, minutes into the ride, near the corner of Touhy and Lincoln avenues in Lincolnwood, she began stabbing him. He managed to pull over his Hyundai and run to a nearby condominium building lobby, where he pushed buzzers and yelled, "Help me, help me. I'm going to die," Assistant State's Attorney Michelle Cunningham said. Wasni took off in Nelson's car but quickly struck a median and then ran off on foot, Cunningham said. She was found nearby wearing just a bra and leggings; a bloodstained Chicago Cubs shirt was found nearby, and a trail of blood led responding officers to the condominium lobby and then to the seriously injured Uber driver, Cunningham said. Alexandra Nelson, sister of victim Grant Nelson, speaks to reporters May 31, 2017, after a hearing at the Skokie courthouse. Assistant State’s Attorney Michelle Cunningham gave a detailed account of the machete and knife attack.

Assistant State’s Attorney Michelle Cunningham gave a detailed account of the machete and knife attack. (Chris Walker / Chicago Tribune)  See more videos Police were able to use the Uber app on his phone to see that "Eliza" was the name of his most recent customer, the prosecutor said. She called Nelson a "random victim." Nelson, who attended New Trier High School in Winnetka and the University of Colorado at Boulder, described his attacker to police but died later at a nearby hospital, officials said. Surveillance footage from Walmart showed Wasni walking around the store with a knife and machete and then leaving without paying for them, the prosecutor said. She said Wasni had taken two earlier Uber rides the evening before, including one to Des Plaines and another from Des Plaines to Walmart. She was apparently in violation of the ride-sharing company's terms and conditions, which say customers must be at least 18 years old. Wasni spoke during the bond court hearing only to confirm her name. Her lawyer, a public defender, said the teen attends Taft High School in Chicago and lives with a single mother. Wasni has been charged as an adult with first-degree murder. Judge Michael Hood ordered her to be held without bail and called the crime "extremely violent." An official with the Cook County sheriff's office said Wasni will be held in a juvenile facility. Outside the courtroom, Nelson's brother, Todd Nelson, called him "the most gentle, kind person. He never hurt anyone. He was good to animals, he was good to children."

Grant Nelson, shown in a family photo, was working for Uber when he was fatally stabbed while dropping off a passenger in Lincolnwood, according to police. (Todd Nelson photo) Grant Nelson, his brother said, loved opera and classical piano and was a "very good" piano player. He had also previously worked at Di Pescara restaurant in Northbrook, a manager there confirmed. "He was just trying to do the best he could in life," Todd Nelson said. His sister, Alexandra Nelson, added that the family hopes "justice will happen," calling the attack "horrifying and maddening." The siblings, as well as their parents, were in the courtroom during the hearing. Alexandra Nelson sat behind her father with her hand on his shoulder as a description of the alleged crime was read by the prosecutor. Family members sobbed at times during the proceedings, including when officials described Grant Nelson begging for help in the lobby before he was found on the ground outside in a pool of blood with multiple stab wounds on his right side. An Uber spokeswoman issued a statement Wednesday saying the company is "heartbroken by the loss of one of our partners, Grant Nelson. Our deepest sympathies and prayers are with his family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time." Regarding the company's 18-and-older age restriction for customers, the spokeswoman later explained that a rider's access to the service can be removed if the rider is found to be underage, and that there is a mechanism for drivers to report riders if they suspect them of being younger than 18. The spokeswoman said Uber has safety tips for drivers and riders, developed with the assistance of law enforcement agencies. She also said that drivers are encouraged to contact local authorities if they ever feel unsafe, and that the app has a two-way feedback system that is monitored around the clock by a team that investigates any problems that are reported.

Welcome to the second edition of Marketer's Brief, a quick read on marketing news, moves and trends. Have tips or suggestions for next week's edition? Send to eschultz@adage.com. Sheryl Crow will perform for Walmart associates in Fayetteville, Ark., tonight. No biggie since Walmart typically brings acts to entertain thousands of employees who come from around the world for its Shareholders Week. (Three Doors Down and Daughtry filled this slot last year.) But Crow stands apart for having had one of her albums banned by Walmart in 1996 over the song, "Love Is a Good Thing," which implied the retailer sells guns to children (contrary to law and store policy). No word on whether the song will be in the concert, but we're guessing not. Sheryl Crow's concert at Bloomington, Illinois Credit: Daniel/Dan Eidsmoe via flickr Another sign of bygones going by: The album is available on Walmart.com from a third-party seller. Said a Walmart spokeswoman: "When it comes to business decisions, every day is a winding road and we've enjoyed many opportunities to work with Sheryl Crow over the last 20 years. We look forward to her entertaining our associates because during our Shareholders' concerts all they want to do is have some fun." Michael Phelps dives all in for Huggies Even for the world's greatest swimmer, endorsement deals start drying up a year after the Olympics. But thanks to birth of his little swimmer, baby Boomer, Michael Phelps is adding Huggies Little Swimmers to a list that includes Intel, Under Armour and 800razors. Here, he and family turn up in a faux press conference to announce the deal from Ogilvy & Mather, Chicago. We're guessing faux, given the applause, but, hey, Donald Trump has engineered some applause at his announcements too. What would Mrs. Brady say? Conagra Brands is selling the Wesson oil brand to The J.M. Smucker Co. in a deal valued at about $285 million as the food marketer keeps tinkering with its portfolio to remodel itself into a house of brands. Conagra referred to Wesson, which it acquired in its 1990 purchase of Beatrice Co., as "an iconic edible oil." Conagra will keep making Wesson products and provide other services during a transition period for up to one year after the deal closes. The sale reminds us here at Marketer's Brief of Florence Henderson, who served as Wesson's pitchwoman from the mid-1970s through the mid-1990s. Donut vs. Doughnut Which spelling entices potential purchasers: donut or doughnut? Just in time for National Donut Day (June 2), Yes Lifecycle Marketing has the answer, at least when it comes to which works better in email subject lines. It's a close call. Emails sent with "donut" in the subject line in the week around last year's National Donut Day held an average open rate of 9.73%. Those with "doughnut" prevailed with an open rate of 10.82%. Fidget spinners: retail's rescuer or mom's curse? The toy du-jour, fidget spinners, could be spinning gold for retailers, Rumplestiltskin-style. On Tuesday, an analyst from Barclays increased her sales forecast for teen chain Five Below, citing spinners as a meaningful trend that is expected to positively impact the store's first-quarter sales. "Spinners may be a much larger phenomenon than the Rainbow Loom, Shopkins, or slime," wrote the analyst. But not everyone is loving the low-priced gadgets -- check out what JP Morgan Chase CMO Kristin Lemkau has to say ... Worst kid trend of 2017? Bottle flipping, fidget spinners or slime? I'm going with slime. — Kristin Lemkau (@KLemkau) May 30, 2017 Tweet of the Week We put together a covfefe of President Underwood's favorites in your city, just in time for the @HouseofCards premier. pic.twitter.com/irYJy0zMA2 — Postmates (@Postmates) May 31, 2017 Number You Need to Know 20% -- the year-to-date decline in golf equipment sales according to NPD Group, showing that Tiger Woods DUI is not the game's only problem. Oreos Cereal Credit: Post Consumer Brands Would You Buy This? Oreos for breakfast? It's true. Oreo O's, first launched in 1998, are coming back in June after a 10-year absence, thanks to Post Consumer Brands. Moves Brandon Solano was named chief marketing officer of Pei Wei after what the Pan-Asian style chain called an extensive national search. Solano was most recently CMO of Papa Murphy's, the take-and-bake pizza chain, and before that had roles at Wendy's and Domino's. Coldwell Banker Real Estate CMO Sean Blankenship is leaving the company, effective June 1. Coldwell stated that he has been transitioning his duties to Senior VP marketing David Marine.

(AAPL): You’re Right to Be Skeptical of AAPL Stock Bitcoin Is Cryptocurrency, But It’s Not Currency Nokia Oyj (ADR) (Nok) Stock Is a Case of Image vs. Reality View All Posts Whenever lazy analysts look at the discount store market, they compare Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) with Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT). As a result, investors have missed one of the decade’s biggest trends — discounting. It’s everywhere, as Dollar General Corp. (NYSE:DG) goes where Walmart fears to tread. Source: Shutterstock In neighborhoods that are too poor to support a Walmart, you’ll find a Dollar General. In towns that are too small to support a Walmart, you will find a Dollar General. Dollar General offers everything Walmart does, but less. A smaller store, with less selection, but geared to the people who depend upon it. The result is the same low-price monopoly in these markets Walmart enjoys in larger towns and along freeway intersections. Thanks to Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR), whose cookie-cutter Family Dollar stores are often sited close to Dollar General, there’s no talk of monopoly, either. But the effect is the same. The Dollar General Effect Is Growing Walmart is often accused of destroying small town America. In fact, it began a process of delivering everyone the same low prices, on the same middle-class goods, found in urban centers. This is something small towns wanted, something the old downtown could not give people. For those towns which thought their tiny size would make them immune to the Walmart Effect, there is Dollar General. In many places, they are the retail environment. What investors should know is that as they go, so goes small town America. Over the past 10 years, Dollar General stock is up 218%. Over five years, the gain is 52%. Since the start of the year, though, DG stock is down 2%. Dollar General is slowing, in part, because the impact of “innovations” Family Dollar brought to the market — alcohol and cigarettes — are in the shares. Family Dollar’s supply contracts with McLane Co., a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.B, NYSE:BRK.A), brought these products into Dollar General markets, and Dollar General followed where it was legal. This has now gone about as far as it can, so same-store sales growth is slowing. To keep its top line moving ahead, Dollar General is opening more stores. It won headlines by noting “10,000 new jobs,” but that’s 1,000 stores. A Dollar General means fewer than a dozen clerk jobs in your town. As it runs out of its traditional customers, Dollar General is also opening a new format, DGX, targeting car-less millennials in urban markets with sodas, coffee and ready-made sandwiches.

More than 3,000 of the 1.5 million Walmart U.S. employees donned in matching blue t-shirts filed into Bud Walton Arena early Wednesday (May 31) to kick off the retail giant’s annual shareholder week. What they heard first from top U.S. executives was “thank you.” Walmart U.S. COO Judith McKenna opened the meeting saying just that, “Thank you for the difference you have made.” There was plenty to celebrate, according to the Wal-Mart execs, from the 1.4% same-store sales reported in the retailer’s first quarter to the 63% jump in e-commerce sales during that same period and 7.3% decline in inventory levels. But some of the most applauded accomplishments included: • Reduced pickup wait time by 29% and increased customer satisfaction; • Closing at 6 P.M. on Christmas Eve; • More than 100,000 employees were Academy graduates; • Shipped 6% more cases last year; and • Raised over $60 million for the Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals “We are winning, and you are part of a company that’s taking it to the competition,” McKenna said. She said training is making a difference and the Walmart Academy’s are a “game changer.” This year she said nearly 250,000 employees will have gone through the academy training. The retailer will have 200 of the academies open by the end of this summer. McKenna also called on employees to be “advocates for anything is possible.” She said there will always be challenges but it’s crucial that employees understand three reasons why they should be advocates. “Wal-Mart is winning and you can make a bigger difference with Walmart than any other company and there is loads of opportunity for you to to grow at Wal-Mart.” Walmart U.S. CEO Greg Foran said the reason he spends the majority of his time out in stores is because he believes when and where you stand determines what you see. “I have to stand with you in the stores to see what your needs are. My parents were teachers and I suppose I do a lot of teaching, more so I am learning for each of you,” he said. “We face enormous challenges … convenience and saving time is important but I also believe price is just as important and that’s not going to change anytime soon. Our 4,676 stores footprint is unrivaled and our e-commerce business is growing each day. Converging these two is a big task but it puts us in a strong position,” Foran said. The one thing that Foran said could tip the scale in Wal-Mart’s favor is “you” he told them. “You are the spark at the core of the Wal-Mart experience. If we get it wrong and someone has a bad experience that’s a downer, but if we get it right it gives us an enormous advantage,” he added. “You are the human authenticity than makes the difference.” In typical Wal-Mart fashion there was entertainment at the event. Former NFL player and actor Terry Crews was the special guest host at the event. He hosted a game of “Walmart Associates Gameday” between management and employees. He treated everyone to his rendition of “Play that Funky Music.” Rising pop star Julia Michaels also performed two songs for the crowd as the musical guest. Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer, took the stage wearing flashlight high top sneakers, one of the new items sold in Walmart this year. He believes the retailer will sell enough of the shoes to light 40 Christmas trees for Rockefeller Center. He also promoted a new tent from Ozark Trails that is equipped with LED lights. He also touted a new M&Ms candy flavor — caramel chocolate which were parachuted down from the ceiling for everyone to try. The party gift in every seat was blow up floats shaped like cupcakes, sodas, or popsicles. Each of the products are new at Walmart. The shareholder meeting is set for Friday morning at Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville.

FILE - In this Wednesday, Sept. 18, 2013, file photo, two Wal-Mart employees walk past a sign in the lobby at the Walmart.com office in San Bruno, Calif. Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Jet.com is accelerating its progress in e-commerce as it works to narrow the gap between itself and online leader Amazon. Wal-Mart is betting its online future on essentials like produce and groceries and has adjusted its shipping strategy. But Amazon keeps innovating too. (Jeff Chiu / AP) Anne D'InnocenzioAssociated Press Privacy Policy Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers gave it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world's largest retailer is betting on essentials like fresh produce, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon's Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart's U.S. online operations, says he's confident about the company's momentum and there's plenty of room for it to thrive. "I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results," Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. "It's about moving fast. It's about innovating. And it's a very big market." He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore's led Wal-Mart's acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he's still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Despite its acquisitions, Wal-Mart said a majority of the increase was through Walmart.com and was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn't putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. "If anything, the gap was widening," Spitz said. "Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question." Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon's path toward Wal-Mart's 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we got a customer base —those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store." Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup helped bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is helping, since people realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon's stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook and furniture pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it's testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensor track items as shoppers go and there's no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there's no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. "We've had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it's never changed our approach," Amazon says. "We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about — low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery." Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet's "smart cart" technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it's helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart's website over the next few years. "We want to sell them everything," Lore said. "The assortment is growing fast," he said. "But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress."

At right is Mercedes Emanuel of Cool, a member of the local Elks Lodge who is taking over the worthwhile effort with help from fellow lodge member Judy Jenkins, not pictured. Hilliard and McKinney, both of whom are wives of Elks, gave credit also to Julianna Turner for her work in helping to start Santa's Open House, a seasonal event that provides a holiday shopping spree for foster kids along with breakfast and festivities at the Elks Lodge in Shingle Springs. Democrat photo by Shelly Thorene FacebookTwitter FacebookTwitter It was 10 years ago that a trio of local women had an idea, a plan to make certain that foster children in El Dorado County would have a better chance at a merry Christmas. Although at first they were told it wasn’t feasible (too costly and too many complicated logistics involved), Pat Hilliard, Fran McKinney and Julianna Turner wouldn’t be dissuaded. And today, a decade later, the three women who against all odds started Santa’s Open House that allows foster kids to shop their hearts out at Walmart in Placerville each holiday season, are stepping aside. Hilliard, McKinney and Turner have done their duty in creating and sustaining a program that has helped so many young people going through difficult times, not only with gifts at Christmas but letting them know that their community always cares about their welfare.   Elfin Elks Both Hilliard’s and McKinney’s husbands are members of Elks Lodge No. 1712 in Shingle Springs and its members who include Turner have been absolutely elfin in helping to present Santa’s Open House for the past 10 years. The Elks opened up the lodge for the initial Santa’s Open Houses where shopping was conducted among donated items and presents including those purchased by Hilliard, McKinney and Turner themselves. Once Walmart became involved some five years ago, the shopping part of the special day occurs there, with two aisles of merchandise reserved and ready, just for the kids’ shopping pleasure. Foster children are given a gift card supported by donations from the public and benevolent organizations including Elks; last year each young shopper received a card worth $125. Walmart carves out a special time slot for the kids and their foster families and Santa Claus is there and waiting, complete with photo opportunities, along with store staff assigned to help the kids go crazy over aisles stuffed with toys, clothing and seasonal sundries. Although the shopping spree now is at Walmart, the doors at the Elks Lodge in Shingle Springs still swing wide that morning. The Elks open up the big, spacious building on Quest Court, readying the bacon, eggs, pancakes and more to welcome the happy families and continue the holiday merriment. After all, shopping’s hard work.   Capable successor It’s with mixed feelings that Hilliard and McKinney hand over Santa’s keys to the open house, but they both agreed it’s time to take it easy. Turner wasn’t present at the lodge as the women recounted their efforts, but Hilliard said no doubt she would share their sentiments. Their decision was made a little bit easier, though, knowing that a capable hand will be taking over, ensuring that foster children are not forgotten. Hilliard and McKinney smiled as they introduced a woman who appears enthusiastic and ready to go, with Elks member Mercedes Emanuel now tasked with keeping Santa’s Open House going. It’s not as easy as one might think. “It won’t be easy following in their footsteps,” said Emanuel recently as the women gathered at the Elks Lodge to talk about the remarkable success of Santa’s Open House. “I’ve already learned it’s a daily effort.” Emanuel, who will be helped by fellow Elk Judy Jenkins in maintaining the holiday event, lives in Cool — and when the phone rings she and husband Frank know that it could be yet another call to come pick up “stuff.”   Rummaging around Mercedes explained that to raise money for such endeavors, the Elks hold big rummage sales twice a year and it is her duty, with help from her husband, to pick up any “leftovers” from area yard sales. And there are lots of yard sales, in all the far reaches of the county, meaning long miles and plenty of boxes in storage at the couple’s home. The Elks Lodge not only is the venue for the merry Christmas breakfast bash, but the lodge helps defray some of the event’s expenses and its members love helping the children shop on the special day. It wasn’t always that way, Hilliard and McKinney reflected, and the women’s eyes caught one other as they talked about how it all started.   Did it anyway It seems Hilliard had gone to Sedona, Ariz., one holiday season and saw that community putting on a program for foster kids. She liked the idea and told her friend McKinney about it. McKinney quickly jumped on board and they took their fledgling thoughts to their husbands’ lodge — but the head Elk at the time said no, the ladies recalled, lips pursed. “He said it was not a good idea,” recalled Hilliard, and now she and McKinney were smiling slightly as they caught eyes. “We did it anyway.” The gals did all the shopping themselves for that initial Santa’s Open House, with the kids coming out to the lodge where they and their foster families enjoyed not only breakfast but crafts tables and other entertainment.   A success The idea caught on, obviously, and today some 100 foster children are participating in the Walmart spree followed by breakfast at the Elks’. (That’s roughly one-third of all the foster children in the county, estimated to number 300.) The children are given gift cards to shop at Walmart and volunteers from the Elks Lodge help the kids pick out their presents. It’s a moving and memorable experience, according to Elks PR maven Barbara Dockter. Dockter said one of the most memorable events of the year in which the Elks, and she personally, participate is Santa’s Open House.   Having heart “It’s one of the most tearful, that’s for sure,” smiled Dockter, on hand to introduce the ladies who created the special day. “Like the time a little 8-year-old girl was asked what she wanted for Christmas — and she said, ‘A heart.’ It turned out that she had had eight surgeries already and was on a waiting list for a new heart.” Dockter said the foster child managed to impact several hearts that day and the Elks were happy to have her and the other kids, along with their families, back to the lodge to keep the holiday spirit alive. Another, older foster kid had an interesting request when it was his turn to speak to Santa. He wanted to be able to pay the family phone bill. Several of the kids at the shopping event have requests every year for Santa that might surprise folks, according to all the ladies. “A lot of them get gifts for others, either their siblings or other family members,” said Dockter as the other ladies nodded knowingly. A bright spot from the past, all agreed, was the time the 8-year-old boy who had just been able to purchase a Walmart bicycle couldn’t wait to try out his new wheels. “He rode his new bike all around Walmart all morning,” said Mercedes. “He had a new bike, helmet and tennis shoes.” Good to go — right on back to the Elks Lodge where Santa had already beaten them there, flying overhead, apparently, from Walmart. Mrs. Claus was at the lodge, too, helping the Elks elves cook up a fantastic breakfast for all. It was noted that occasionally foster kids who are siblings are not only removed from their troubled family environment but too often are separated from each other because they are assigned to different foster homes. Months may have gone by before they have been able to see one other, with the reunion at Walmart a poignant one for all. Looking back on what they have accomplished, giving so much of themselves in an effort that has flourished for 10 years, Fran McKinney said she is slightly amazed.   An impressive decade “I am so impressed that it has been 10 years,” said the woman whose colleagues call her the Energizer Bunny. “I love that the foster children are able to have something because of what we have done. When you see those children’s happy faces you know it has been worth the effort. “I’ll miss it.” Pat Hilliard, the woman whose idea was sparked in Sedona, smiled at the memories and then her demeanor became wistful. She noted that health issues prevent her from going any farther in leading what has proven to be a wonderful holiday program.   Community effort In addition to Walmart, several other groups and organizations, including the Cameron Park Newcomers and the Gold Nugget Quilters, support the effort. Donations keep the project going and the amount of money each child may be given varies; last year each foster received gift cards worth $125. Mercedes Emanuel listened as the women recounted their success, then she turned an eye toward the future. Although she must wash and hang all the clothing donated by every yard sale on the planet, she said she has no problem taking on the tremendous organizational challenge of Santa’s Open House. And she has a quite compelling reason for that positive attitude. “My husband and I have a special-needs son,” Mercedes explained. “He was adopted when he was 1 week old. “I completely understand how the community can impact a family. When you have a community pitching in, showing that you stand with us …” her voice trailed as her words sank in. Mercedes said her son Andrew today is 20 years old and thriving. Those wishing to donate to Santa’s Open House may contact Mercedes Emanuel at (916) 712-8842.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world's largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon's Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart's U.S. online operations, says he's confident about the company's momentum and that there's plenty of room for it to thrive. "I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results," Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. "It's about moving fast. It's about innovating. And it's a very big market." He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore led Wal-Mart's acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he's still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal-Mart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn't putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. "If anything, the gap was widening," Spitz said. "Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question." Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon's path toward Wal-Mart's 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store." Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon's stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it's testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there's no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there's no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. "We've had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it's never changed our approach," Amazon says. "We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about — low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery." Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet's "smart cart" technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it's helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart's website over the next few years. "We want to sell them everything," Lore said. "The assortment is growing fast," he said. "But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress." © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Wal-Mart Works To Close Gap Between Itself and Amazon By Anne DInnocenzio PUBLISHED: MAY 31 2017 Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers gave it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world's largest retailer is betting on essentials like fresh produce, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon's Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart's U.S. online operations, says he's confident about the company's momentum and there's plenty of room for it to thrive. "I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results," Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. "It's about moving fast. It's about innovating. And it's a very big market." He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore's led Wal-Mart's acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he's still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Despite its acquisitions, Wal-Mart said a majority of the increase was through Walmart.com and was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of consulting firm ChannelAdvisors, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn't putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. "If anything, the gap was widening," Spitz said. "Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question." Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon's path toward Wal-Mart's 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we got a customer base -- those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store." Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup helped bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is helping, since people realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon's stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook and furniture pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it's testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensor track items as shoppers go and there's no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there's no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. "We've had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it's never changed our approach," Amazon says. "We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about -- low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery." Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet's "smart cart" technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it's helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart's website over the next few years. "We want to sell them everything," Lore said. "The assortment is growing fast," he said. "But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress." © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

By ANNE D'INNOCENZIOAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com is accelerating its progress in e-commerce as it works to narrow the gap with online leader Amazon. But Amazon keeps innovating, too, such as with its experimental Amazon Go convenience stores, currently open only to its employees in Seattle. Associated Press/Jeff Chiu, File HOBOKEN, N.J. — Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Wal-Mart to escape the Amazon in the room. Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world’s largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon’s Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart’s U.S. online operations, says he’s confident about the company’s momentum and that there’s plenty of room for it to thrive. “I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results,” Lore said at Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. “It’s about moving fast. It’s about innovating. And it’s a very big market.” He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore led Wal-Mart’s acquisitions of specialty online retailers such as ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he’s still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal-Mart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn’t putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. “If anything, the gap was widening,” Spitz said. “Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question.” Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. “We don’t think specifically about Prime at all,” Lore said. “We think we (have) a customer base – those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store.” Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart because they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. Amazon’s stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But Amazon keeps innovating. It’s testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there’s no need to check out. Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick them up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there’s no order minimum. Share Read or Post Comments Send questions/comments to the editors. Want the news vital to Maine?

Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world’s largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon’s Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Wal-Mart’s U.S. online operations, says he’s confident about the company’s momentum and that there’s plenty of room for it to thrive. “I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results,” Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey. “It’s about moving fast. It’s about innovating. And it’s a very big market.” He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore led Wal-Mart’s acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he’s still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Wal-Mart wants to grow faster. As Wal-Mart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Wal-Mart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some shoppers it has become ingrained that they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Wal-Mart wasn’t putting a sufficient emphasis on keeping up. “If anything, the gap was widening,” Spitz said. “Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question.” Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Wal-Mart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon’s relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon’s path toward Wal-Mart’s 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is “reasonable.” If Lore is worried, he doesn’t acknowledge it. “We don’t think specifically about Prime at all,” he said. “We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store.” Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Wal-Mart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is helping bring shoppers in. Wal-Mart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon’s stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it’s testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there’s no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall. Moreover, Amazon also launched two grocery pickup kiosks in Seattle that allow Prime customers to buy fresh items online and pick it up in as little as 15 minutes instead of having them delivered. The service is free, and there’s no order minimum. Shipping remains intensely competitive. Amazon Prime members in more than 5,000 cities and towns can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. Through Prime Now, members in more than 30 cities can get some items in an hour or two. “We’ve had competition every day of our existence at Amazon and it’s never changed our approach,” Amazon says. “We obsess over customers and the things we believe customers will always care about — low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery.” Wal-Mart has revamped its shipping program and now offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore says Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. In April, Wal-Mart launched a service called Easy Reorder where the items shoppers buy with their credit card at a store will pop up on their online account for replenishment. As more integration happens behind the scenes of Walmart.com and Jet.com, Lore says that over time, Jet’s “smart cart” technology will be integrated into the Wal-Mart site. Jet was built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping. It adjusts prices and encourages shoppers to buy certain items for more savings. Wal-Mart says it’s helping people to shop smarter by encouraging them to build an order of $35 and offering extra discounts for store pickups of online orders. And Lore says the plan is to get to several hundred million products on Wal-Mart’s website over the next few years. “We want to sell them everything,” Lore said. “The assortment is growing fast,” he said. “But we know in certain categories, we need to make more progress.” ——— Follow Anne D’Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio     Tags: amazon, online, prime, shoppers, percent, shipping, Other stories from today: Banks pull stocks away from records as seven-day streak ends Uber fires autonomous car researcher involved in lawsuit Wal-Mart works to close gap between itself and Amazon     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   What do you think of legislation passed by the state Senate and heading to the Assembly that would create single-payer health care system in California?

I too have an ATM only card, but not from KeyBank. I am curious as to why T.R. of North Olmsted would have presented his ATM-only card at Walmart for a purchase, knowing that it is was "ATM-only"? Was it a mistake? If not, what did T.R. expect to happen? Adding to my curiosity is the fact that it happened twice.   I would never even consider trying to use my "ATM Only" card anywhere but at an ATM machine.   C.H., Cleveland Heights   A: Yes, it was apparently a mistake by T.R., the first and second times over the past year. It didn't strike me as an unreasonable mistake; I know I've pulled the wrong card out of my wallet before. A lot of my plastic tends to be gray or blue. I could understand, for example, that someone reaching for her Macy's card might instead pull out her Target card, because they're both bright red.   I believe T.R. thought that if he accidentally pulled out a card that needed a PIN to work, then it wouldn't work without his PIN. If the transaction had exceeded $25, then it would not have gone through. It's like when I'm at the gas pump and slide my credit card and then accidentally hit debit instead of credit. The transaction won't proceed without a PIN, which I don't have. I have to back out of the transaction and start over.   I'm going to try out one of my ATM/PIN-only cards at a handful of stores in the next few weeks to see if I can use it without the PIN. If you try yours for a small transaction under $25, let me know whether you're successful or not.   Q: What can I do about the imposter IRS numbers that call my cell phone. They leave a voice message saying that they are from the IRS and that there is a pending lawsuit against me.  I obviously do not contact them back. Just on a whim, on a Saturday, I pressed "call back" and someone answered "IRS," I of course hung up.   I have kept the numbers in my phone log. I feel bad that there are some people that fall prey to this scam.  Is there a way to report these numbers?   B.G., Twinsburg   A: First, please don't call them back again. Just don't. It only alerts the scam artists that they may have a live one. Calling back won't decrease the number of calls you get from people trying to defraud you. It will only increase them, because these low-lifes run in the same circles and share information.   Assuming you know or believe you don't owe any taxes, here's what the IRS says you should do:   1. Do not give out any information. Hang up immediately. Don't confirm your name. Don't tell them you know it's a scam. Don't tell them you believe the Cavs are going to win a second NBA title. Don't say anything. Just hang up.   2. Contact the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) by phone or online. Call TIGTA at 800-366-4484. Or you can report the call and the offending phone number by going to https://www.treasury.gov/tigta/contact_report_scam.shtml   3. Report the attempted scam to the Federal Trade Commission. Go to https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/#%26panel1-1 Make note that your query concerns an "IRS telephone scam." If you're not sure whether you owe taxes, or think you might, call the real IRS at 800-829-1040. IRS workers can help you figure out your situation and discuss how you will pay anything you might owe.     View Comments About Us About Cleveland.com About Advance Ohio Advertise with us Audience FAQ Contact Us Career Opportunities Community FAQ Subscribe The Plain Dealer Sun News eNewsletters Subscriber Service Media Insider Rewards View My Profile Report a Delivery Issue Place a Vacation Hold Make a Payment Cleveland.com Sections News Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Politics Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Rentals Classifieds Shopping Deals and Coupons Local Businesses Deals in Your Area Your Regional News Pages Beachwood Brunswick Lakewood Parma & Parma Heights Strongsville More Communities Mobile Mobile Apps More on Cleveland.com Videos Photos Interact with us Weather Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sitemap & search Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Instagram | Pinterest Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2017 Advance Ohio All rights reserved (About Us).

By Allan Ellinger on May 31, 2017 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Gigi Hadid As the fashion and retail landscape continues to evolve at warp speed, “old guard” vendors and newer digitally native e-commerce companies are rapidly converging at an M&A intersection of mutual need. While online players offer the right combination of technology, data-driven consumer insights and social engagement as well as aesthetics, established, traditionally rooted firms bring operational excellence, product development and sourcing capabilities, in addition to sorely needed working capital. Veteran brands and labels would be wise to find a next-gen partner to intelligently enter the digital fray as it is often cheaper to buy it than to build it. It appears that patience in the venture capital and private equity communities for next-generation fashion and retail-tech companies is waning, given burn rates that are too high and success rates that are too low. As capital is beginning to dry up for still unprofitable e-commerce start-ups, opportunities for strategics will open up at prices worth negotiating. The core competencies of design, manufacturing and sourcing, logistics and importing remain intrinsic to the fashion industry and where — via the right strategic relationship — one can provide digital retailers with much-needed business acumen, a strong balance sheet and leverageable infrastructure. Allan Ellinger  Look at the evolving strategies at Wal-Mart, Tommy Hilfiger and PVH. These “old guard” retailers and brands are jumping into this new industry paradigm, risking capital and brand equity for the opportunity to remain viable with new consumers tomorrow. At Wal-Mart, the $3.3 billion Jet.com acquisition brought digital entrepreneur Marc Lore to the retailer, and he is quickly putting his fingerprint on the organization with new acquisitions and hires that position Wal-Mart to better compete digitally with Amazon et al. Lore has been given the necessary autonomy needed to drive a new business model supported by Wal-Mart’s world class logistics and infrastructure. Kudos to Wal-Mart for stepping out of its comfort zone and trying and testing new retail approaches. An intensive focus on social media and a new consumer is at play at PVH’s Tommy Hilfiger. Shifting its operating model to see-now-buy-now, creating the fashion event Tommyland at Venice Beach, leveraging Gigi Hadid’s celebrity power and youth appeal, and employing a digitally focused global media campaign all have amplified the voice and reach of the Tommy Hilfiger brand and altered its business model, better equipping the company to compete as a nimbler, just-in-time, fashion brand. PVH has been active on the acquisition front as well. In March 2017, this 137-year-old apparel company purchased True & Co. a five-year-old born on the web direct-to-consumer e-commerce bra brand, adding to its Calvin Klein, Warner’s and Olga intimates businesses. PVH will now have in-house data analytics that drive True & Co.’s success and can be leveraged across PVH’s brands while providing category expertise, global brand management and supply chain know-how that will support True & Co.’s next leg of growth. Success in today’s fashion industry is increasingly tenuous amid the growing number of store closures and bankruptcies in tandem with the seemingly daily arrival of yet another “fashion tech digital disruptor” and the continuing onslaught of Amazon. This year, many traditional apparel brands and labels will see sales volume decline in tandem with fewer points of distribution and competition from the newest flavor of the day. Even established brands with strong consumer loyalty are navigating a choppy landscape as consumer demands are changing faster than their ability to keep pace. The rate of change is unprecedented and it is working its way through the apparel ecosystem, from design, textile production to assembly and manufacturing, to logistics and distribution and finally to point of sale as digitization impacts the entire supply chain. These challenges and more will increase for the next few years as creative destruction continues. Over the long haul, the digital shift should generate efficiencies that yield enhanced profitability. Opportunities co-exist with these challenges. But, this requires a new framework, out-of-the-box thinking, and a willingness to test and try new business models. The need for a new vision replete with new goals, new brand and marketing strategies and as importantly, new level talent is a must. Internal, radical organizational and cultural change is extremely difficult, it often takes too long and can upset the corporate structure. An alternative route is to find a strategic partner that has the digital know-how and the social media savvy that your business lacks, while offering the depth of industry experience digital disruptors need in order to achieve, profitable growth. The right combinations can supercharge both partners and result in synergies benefiting both parties. This isn’t about next season, or next year. This is about long-term survival. The biggest risk today is to do nothing. Simply put, inactivity or indecision is not a strategy. Allan Ellinger is cofounder and senior managing director of MMG Advisors.

(Mike Segar/Reuters) Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery. (Mike Segar/Reuters) Amazon shares break through $1,000 mark for first time Add to ... SPENCER SOPER SEATTLE — Bloomberg News Published Tuesday, May 30, 2017 10:05AM EDT Last updated Tuesday, May 30, 2017 5:42PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Amazon.com Inc.’s shares topped $1,000 (U.S.) for the first time, marking a new milestone for a company wooing investors by dominating online commerce and cloud computing, two industries expected to keep growing as shopping habits change and businesses rethink how they deploy technology. Amazon shares touched $1,001.20 in intraday trading Tuesday, up about 40 per cent from a year ago and more than double the 15 per cent gain of the S&P 500 index in the same period, before closing at $996.70. Investors are thinking about how much further Amazon can grow as it tries to replicate its U.S. success abroad. The shares will likely push even higher since Amazon is growing so quickly in massive global industries that show no signs of slowing, said John Blackledge, analyst at Cowen and Co. LLC, who recently upped his Amazon price target to $1,125 a share. “There’s a long runway there,” he said. “The markets Amazon is playing in with global retail and cloud computing are just massive. Things continue to go well and investors are looking for more upside.” The Seattle company’s $477-billion market value is double that of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. even though the world’s biggest retailer will have sales three times larger than Amazon’s this year. Investors put more value in Amazon’s Web traffic and delivery network than they do in Wal-Mart’s vast store presence because online spending will grow more than four times faster than overall retail spending this year as shoppers continue to shift from stores to websites, according to EMarketer Inc. The world’s largest online retailer is dominating e-commerce with its $99-a-year Amazon Prime subscription, which includes delivery discounts, music and video streaming and photo storage that keep shoppers engaged with the website. Seattle-based Amazon had 80 million Prime subscribers in the U.S. as of March 31, an increase of 38 per cent from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Prime memberships help lock in loyalty, which is critical as competitors such as Wal-Mart enhance their e-commerce offerings to slow Amazon’s momentum. Amazon has been tackling retail one category at a time, disrupting bookstores and electronics stores first, and more recently pushing into apparel and groceries. Its rise has coincided with the decline of prominent retail chains such as Macy’s Inc. and Sears Holdings Corp., which have shuttered stores and laid off workers in response to declining sales. cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, which maintains a global network of data centres and rents out storage space and computing functions to clients in a variety of industries, including Netflix Inc. and Airbnb Inc. as well as Capital One Financial Corp. and the U.S. federal government. Yelp runs many of its functions on AWS. This year, companies around the world will funnel $246.8-billion to Amazon and other cloud services providers, according to Gartner Inc., up 18 per cent from 2016. Amazon’s rise has made its founding CEO Jeff Bezos the world’s second-wealthiest person, behind only Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index. His ascendancy has won praise from fellow self-made billionaires Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and judge on the television show Shark Tank. “Amazon is worth far more than $1,000 a share,” said Mr. Cuban, an Amazon investor. “Consumers always want things at lower prices delivered faster. Amazon uses data better than anyone to achieve those goals for everything it sells.

Even after an online spending spree, it may be hard for Walmart to escape the Amazon in the room. Walmart's acquisition of Jet.com and brands that appeal to younger shoppers have given it an e-commerce boost as it works to close the gap between itself and the online leader. The world's largest retailer is betting on essentials like cereal and diapers, and has adjusted its shipping strategy to better compete with Amazon's Prime program. But Amazon keeps innovating too, implementing new technology and trying to make shopping more convenient. Marc Lore, a co-founder of Jet.com who is now head of Walmart's U.S. online operations, says he's confident about the company's momentum and that there's plenty of room for it to thrive. "I can tell you we are happy with the moves we are making, and we are happy with the results," Lore said at the Jet headquarters in Hoboken, N.J. "It's about moving fast. It's about innovating. And it's a very big market." He noted that e-commerce sales industrywide are still growing 15 percent per year. Lore led Walmart's acquisitions of specialty online retailers like ModCloth, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy.com, and said he's still looking at companies that have expertise in categories where Walmart wants to grow faster. As Walmart prepares to show off some of its innovations this week before its shareholder meeting, there are signs that things are starting to click. Sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent in the first quarter, up from 29 percent growth in the previous quarter and marking its fourth straight quarter of increases. Walmart said most of the increase was not through acquisitions but was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. Walmart.com now offers 50 million products including those from third-party sellers, up from 10 million a year ago. In comparison, Amazon has hundreds of millions of products. David Spitz, CEO of e-commerce technology company ChannelAdvisor, says for some it has become ingrained they start and finish their shopping at Amazon, and the Prime program reinforces that. He said Walmart wasn't putting an emphasis on keeping up. "If anything, the gap was widening," Spitz said. "Jet.com was intended to be a jolt. Wal-Mart is clearly being more aggressive. There is a sense of urgency, but whether that is enough is the multibillion-dollar question." Amazon accounted for 33 percent of U.S. online sales last year, according to the research firm Euromonitor. Walmart moved into second place ahead of eBay, with 7.8 percent. Greg Melich, an analyst at research firm Evercore, estimates that Amazon customers spend an average of $800 annually on the site, and members of its $99-a-year Prime program spend on average 2.7 times more than others. If Amazon's relationship with Prime members continues to grow, Melich said recently, then Amazon's path toward Walmart's 9 percent of the total U.S. retail market from its current 3 percent is "reasonable." If Lore is worried, he doesn't acknowledge it. "We don't think specifically about Prime at all," he said. "We think we (have) got a customer base — those customers who want to be able to save money and they want to be able to shop in different ways, whether it be direct-to-home, grocery pickup or going to the physical store." Its 4,700 stores are a strength for Walmart, as they buck the larger retail trend in seeing increases in shopper numbers and sales. The discount for store pickup is bringing shoppers in. Walmart says even the expansion of stores with curbside pickup for groceries is also helping, since people often realize they forgot an item or two and run into the store. And as rivals like Target struggle to get their grocery departments right, Wal-Mart is placing a priority on essentials like peanut butter, paper towels and fresh produce that shoppers buy often. Amazon's stores are mainly showcases for gadgets, or are textbook- and furniture-pickup locations aimed at college students. But it keeps innovating, and it's testing an Amazon Go convenience store, where sensors track items as shoppers go and there's no need to check out. Amazon just opened its first bookstore in Manhattan and seventh overall.

Amazon, the internet goliath that revolutionized the way much of the world buys books, toilet paper and TVs, hit a new milestone Tuesday: Its stock surpassed the $1,000 mark for the first time. That price put Amazon's market value at about $478 billion, double that of the world's biggest traditional retailer, Walmart, and more than 15 times the size of Target. A $1,000 investment on Amazon's first day of trading in 1997 would be worth more than $500,000 today. Not only has Amazon changed the retail landscape since it became a public company 20 years ago, it's now part of a small cadre of high-flying stocks belonging to companies that have defied Wall Street and shunned stock splits. Those splits make the stock more affordable and generate brokerage fees. But companies like Amazon have chosen to reward its long-term investors. The last time Amazon has split its stock was nearly 18 years ago, according to financial research firm FactSet. Another company with a similar philosophy is Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google. Amazon just beat Alphabet to the $1,000 level, with its Class A shares just $2 short of $1,000 on Tuesday. Only four other U.S.-listed companies have shares trading above $1,000: online travel booking company Priceline Group Inc., homebuilder NVR Inc., pork producer and ocean transportation company Seaboard Corp. and the apostle of long-term investing, Warren Buffett, with his holding company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. But stock prices only tell a part of the story. The value of a company is determined by its stock price and the number of shares on the market. Amazon.com is well over four times the size of Priceline, NVR and Seaboard combined. It is 17 percent bigger than Berkshire Hathaway, a multinational conglomerate with ownership stakes in some of America's most well-known consumer brands like Coca-Cola, insurance companies and U.S. infrastructure. Since launching a website to sell mostly books in 1995, Amazon has transfigured retail, sent revenue numbers to stratospheric heights and is among the biggest reasons longtime powerhouses like Macy's, Borders bookstores and even RadioShack have suffered. Those companies are closing locations and Amazon is filling the void, sometimes literally. Last week in a location once occupied by Borders, the bookstore chain that went out of business in 2011, Amazon opened its first bookstore in New York City.

Amazon hit an intraday high of US$1,001.20 in New York before ending the day little changed at US$996.70. The stock is up almost 40 per cent from a year ago and more than double the 15 per cent gain of the S&P 500 Index in the same period. Investors are thinking about how much further Amazon can grow as it tries to replicate its US success abroad. The shares will likely push even higher since Amazon is growing so quickly in massive global industries that show no signs of slowing, as shopping habits change and businesses rethink how they deploy technology, said Mr John Blackledge, analyst at Cowen and Co, who recently upped his Amazon price target to US$1,125 a share. "There's a long runway there," he said. "The markets Amazon is playing in with global retail and cloud computing are just massive. Things continue to go well and investors are looking for more upside." Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up The Seattle company's US$478 billion (S$660 billion) market value is double that of Walmart Stores even though the world's biggest retailer will have sales three times larger than Amazon's this year. Investors put more value in Amazon's Web traffic and delivery network than they do in Walmart's vast store presence because online spending will grow more than four times faster than overall retail spending this year as shoppers continue to shift from stores to websites, according to EMarketer. The world's largest online retailer is dominating e-commerce with its US$99-a-year Amazon Prime subscription, which includes delivery discounts, music and video streaming and photo storage that keep shoppers engaged with the website. Amazon had 80 million Prime subscribers in the US as of March 31, an increase of 38 per cent from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Prime memberships help lock in loyalty, which is critical as competitors such as Walmart enhance their e-commerce offerings to slow Amazon's momentum. Amazon has been tackling retail one category at a time, disrupting bookstores and electronics stores first and more recently pushing into apparel and groceries. Its rise has coincided with the decline of prominent retail chains such as Macy's and Sears Holdings, which have shuttered stores and laid off workers in response to declining sales. Shopping malls have resorted to hosting concerts and carnivals in empty parking lots to keep customers coming. Another Amazon advantage is its profitable and fast-growing cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, which maintains a global network of data centres and rents out storage space and computing functions to clients in a variety of industries, including Netflix and Airbnb, as well as Capital One Financial Corp and the federal government. Amazon's rise has made its founding chief executive officer Jeff Bezos the world's second wealthiest person, behind only Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. "Amazon is worth far more than US$1,000 a share," said Mr Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and an Amazon investor. "Consumers always want things at lower prices delivered faster. Amazon uses data better than anyone to achieve those goals for everything it sells. They have a chance to be the most dominant company in the world."

The European Union's top climate change official says Trump's decision to leave the Paris accord made it "a sad day for the global community." ___ Despite Trump, cleaner energy growth expected to carry on WASHINGTON (AP) — The push to use cleaner forms of energy is unlikely to slow down, even after President Donald Trump says he'll abandon U.S. pledges to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming. Around the world, coal-fired power plants are being shuttered as governments and private companies invest billions in wind turbines and solar farms. ___ US job market looks solid 8 years after recession ended WASHINGTON (AP) — Exactly eight years after the Great Recession ended, the U.S. job market has settled into a sweet spot of steadily solid growth. On Friday, when the government releases the jobs report for May, the pattern is likely to extend itself. ___ Investors pick Tesla's promise over GM's steady profits DETROIT (AP) — Tesla and General Motors have a budding rivalry that could help determine whether Detroit or Silicon Valley sets the course for the future of the auto industry. Right now Wall Street is favouring the upstart led by flamboyant Elon Musk to the established icon headed by the more restrained Mary Barra. ___ US auto sales fall for fifth straight month in May DETROIT (AP) — U.S. auto sales fell for the fifth straight month in May, bolstering expectations for the first annual sales decline since 2009. Some industry analysts lowered predictions for the year as General Motors, Fiat Chrysler, Hyundai and Toyota reported May decreases compared with a year ago. ___ Fund investing is cheaper than ever, and it's because of you NEW YORK (AP) — Investors paid lower expenses last year than ever before for their mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, and all the credit goes to investors themselves. Investors are plowing their money into the cheapest funds, which puts pressure on the rest of the industry to cut their own expenses or risk losing even more dollars. ___ Walmart testing store employee delivery of US online orders BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) — Walmart says it's testing a delivery service using its own store associates, who will deliver packages ordered online while driving home from their regular work shifts. The "associate delivery" program would use Walmart's 4,700 U.S. stores and roughly 1.2 million employees to speed delivery and cut costs. It's the retailer's latest effort to compete with online giant Amazon. ___ Trump's cellphone use worries security experts WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump, who blasted Hillary Clinton for using a personal email server, might be a walking magnet for eavesdropping and malware if he's using an unsecured cellphone to chat with foreign leaders. Trump has been handing out his cellphone number to counterparts around the world, urging them to call him directly to avoid the red tape of diplomatic communications. In today's world of cyber espionage, cellphone security experts say such a policy is not only unorthodox, but dangerous. ___ AP Interview: France warns of risk of war in cyberspace PARIS (AP) — A French cybersecurity official warns there could be a "permanent war" between states and criminal or extremist groups because of hacking attacks. The head of the French government's cybersecurity agency, Guillaume Poupard, tells the Associated Press that a "nightmare scenario" would be "chaos" in which "everyone will attack each other, without really knowing who did what." Last month, the head of the U.S. National Security Agency told senators that cyber war is "real and here to stay." ___ US stocks back at record highs after better jobs data NEW YORK (AP) — A broad push higher for stocks sent indexes to records on Thursday following yet more signs that the job market continues to improve. ___ Uber posts $708 million loss and says finance head left HONG KONG (AP) — Uber posted a $708 million loss in the most recent quarter and said its head of finance is leaving, the latest executive to depart. It's been a rough year for the San Francisco company. It lost its head of communications, president and other senior executives in recent months as it faces allegations of sexism and sexual harassment in the workplace. ___ The Standard & Poor's 500 index ended at 2,430.06, up 18.26 points, or 0.8 per cent.

Casey Ferrand Reporter NEW ORLEANS — Working women in New Orleans are asking for equal pay for equal work, but Louisiana lawmakers have killed several bills aimed at closing the state's gender pay gap during the current legislative session. Advertisement Women in Louisiana are paid 68 cents for every dollar a man is paid, and the disparity is worse for African-American and Latin women. According to the National Partnership for Women and Families, the median annual pay for a woman in Louisiana who holds a full-time, year-round job is $31,586. For men, it's $48,382, a wage gap of about $16,000. Women who gathered to protest and spread the word about their cause on Tuesday said lower wages mean less money to save for the future or to spend on basic goods and services. Walmart, the nation's largest private employer, raised its starting wage early this year from $9 per hour to $10 per hour for new employees. "The position I'm in, the starting wage is $10.80. So until these past raises in March, I was only making 20 cents more after eight years than a brand-new associate walking in the door," said Betsey Marler, who has worked at Walmart for eight years. She and other women are asking Walmart to be transparent and reveal the average wages for women vs. men. "When Walmart raised their starting wage, so did Target, Marshalls and other places. We feel if Walmart will be more transparent and disclose this information, then the other major companies in the nation will do so also," Marler said. Blake Jackson, a Walmart spokesman, provided a statement: "We believe that associates with the same qualifications, making the same effort to achieve the same result, should receive the same rate of pay for performing the same work. We've invested $2.7 billion in training, education and higher wages to create paths of opportunity, and we're proud that 57 percent of the hourly associates who received promotions during the past year were women." Walmart provided additional information about the company: As reported in Walmart's 2017 GRR (global responsibility report), women comprise 55 percent of the company's total U.S. associate population, as well as 57 percent of the hourly-associates associates who were promoted during the last year. Walmart also reported in its 2017 GPR that people of color represented about 43 percent of its total U.S. associate population and about 45 percent of the hourly associates in the U.S. who were promoted last year. People of color also represented about 53 percent of all newly hired associates in the U.S. The group said it is relying on Louisiana lawmakers to create more legislation to help even the playing field for women, but several bills introduced this session have been blocked. "We voted for them to have our back, and they're pretty much failing us because this is something we want and need," Melinda Yonta said. Legislators this session have failed to pass three bills, including Senate Bill 2, authored by Sen. J.P. Morrell, that would have extended protections under the Louisiana Pay Act to men and women and clarified how and when workers can sue their employers. Morell said the bill would have provided workers with the tools to address inequities. He plans to file a version of the bill again next year. Earlier this month, lawmakers shot down two other bills that would have narrowed the wage gap. House Bill 112 required companies that have public government contracts to comply with existing equal pay laws. House Bill 222 would have prohibited private employers from retaliating against employees who discuss their wages. "It takes us as women and our community people to come out and support us and fight for this so we can win equal pay for equal work," Yonta said.

Woman shot in chest while waiting in line at Pizza Luce Charley Walters: The way he’s hitting, Joe Mauer might have a .300 season for Twins Wally McCarthy, car-selling wizard of the Twin Cities, dies at 94 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers go out with a bang on what could be their last tour Body found in Lake Minnetonka ID’d as Blaine man SAINTED & TAINTED In April, I decided to take my grocery cart down to Walmart in West St. Paul to pick up some cases of pop. I had my cart completely full of pop and was going to the bus stop on South Robert to go home. I was in the parking lot between Jimmy John’s and Taco Bell going up the hill.  A dark blue car kept coming toward me and I tried to back up but I couldn’t — I wasn’t fast enough to avoid the car because the cart was full. The car hit my cart and broke off one of the wheels. The driver got out and asked me if I was OK. I said I was but my cart wasn’t. She offered to take me home and pay me for the cart. I mentioned calling the police. She asked me not to call the police. In fact, she got very angry about me wanting to call them. I finally called West St. Paul Police. After about five minutes, two police officers showed up. They questioned me and then the driver of the car. Then they said they would give me a ride home with my pop and broken cart. On the way home, I asked the officers if the driver had insurance. They said no. “That is illegal,” I said. They said, “That is why we gave her a ticket.” About an hour after the officers dropped me off at my home, someone came to my door. It was the two police officers. When I opened the door, they said, “We have something for you, a new cart.” That was totally unexpected and I want to say how happy I am with the West St. Paul Police Department.  I want to express my appreciation to these officers. Ron Woelfel, West St. Paul   TAINTED In response to the May 14 Tainted letter (“With springtime comes the opening of windows. And the smell of second-hand smoke”): You are absolutely right about the dubious “privilege of sucking in second-hand smoke.” As to renters getting action in response to their complaints about smells of cigarettes, it is not necessarily so. Some renters I have talked with have said that when they have complained of cigarette smells in neighboring units, they were told that since the tenant in question had signed the “non-smoking rental lease,” of course, the tenant could not have been smoking. The same applies to marijuana smoking in rentals. The smell seeps into other apartments. Not everyone appreciates the stench (personal opinion). Inhaling weed should be a choice; unfortunately, apartment dwellers cannot make that choice. If the landlord doesn’t believe the complaining tenants, and if he or she seldom visits the properties, there is no proof of lease or health violations. Whether the smoking is outside or in an adjacent apartment, the renter has no more voice or action than the homeowner. The renter, though, may likely suffer retaliation for having made complaints to appropriate city departments. S. Holben, St. Paul   SAINTED Greg at the Eva Street postal facility in St. Paul didn’t let working the Saturday of a holiday weekend rain on his professionalism and good spirits. He was friendly and knowledgeable and went way beyond the expected for one of Life Wireless’s customers, who called in trying to locate a missing package. The number she gave us took us to Greg, who did absolutely everything he could to get her package for her as soon as possible, even visiting another office that was closed at the time. Our customer couldn’t get it that day, so Greg provided a specific time when she could pick it up after the holiday weekend. Greg’s positive, sunny disposition and friendly and efficient assistance made our customer’s day. He impressed us here at Life Wireless in Atlanta, Ga., and we wanted you to know it! The Eva Street facility has a winner in Greg. Leslie Roesler, Atlanta, Ga. The writer is customer service supervisor at Life Wireless.   SAINTED At about 5 p.m. on the Saturday before Mother’s Day, my sister and mom and I pulled up to the parking lot of the new Ichiddo Ramen near the corner of University and Grotto, determined to get a bowl of the savory noodles. We noticed a middle-age man, who we guessed to be severely inebriated, staggering from pole to pole on University. With every step forward, he took two steps back, and risked smashing his head on the sidewalk with each unsteady lurch forward. We decided he was at great risk of injuring himself and called 911 for assistance. Hats off to the professionalism of the 911 center and the officer who responded quickly in his squad car. I’m not one to blindly support police actions in every situation, but this officer handled himself extremely well. Jim Sanoden, St. Paul   SAINTED We would like to saint the Little Angels Preschool located at Guardian Angels Church in Oakdale, and the school’s staff, especially Miss Melissa, Miss Anne and the director, Nance Lyons. Our grandson Jasper attended the 4-year-olds’ class. Jasper had not been exposed to formal education but was ready to learn. The awesome experience that was Little Angles Preschool will serve him well as he heads to kindergarten this fall. Thank you for making his first school exposure such a positive, affordable learning experience.  It is true, it takes a village, and we are very grateful to have found this “village” for Jasper. Paul and Linda Chimzar, Woodbury   SAINTED My husband and I want to thank the hundreds of volunteers involved in the clean-up after the tornado that hit the Chetek, Wis., area and surrounding communities. The Red Cross, Team Rubicon, the Salvation Army, Barron County Services, churches, schools and so many more … the list goes on and on. Seeing, feeling and joining the strong sense of community is amazing, and we hope that all of this helps in the healing, mending and rebuilding process.  Thank you, all, for everything you’ve done and continue to do during this difficult time.

Employers added just 138,000 jobs in May, though that was enough to help cut the unemployment rate to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent. ___ Quitting Paris likely to have muted effect in key industries DALLAS (AP) — Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement may have only limited impact on key sectors in the economy. Some executives criticized the move. Analysts say market conditions will be a bigger factor in determining US energy production after Paris. ___ Pittsburgh to Trump: You don't speak for us on climate PITTSBURGH (AP) — In announcing plans to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord, President Donald Trump declared that he was "elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris." But the Steel City is hardly in Trump's corner on this one. Pittsburgh's mayor is reaffirming his commitment to curbing global warming and pushing ahead with green energy projects. ___ AP Explains: Why China is stepping up against climate change BEIJING (AP) — By backing off the U.S. commitment to address climate change, President Donald Trump leaves an opening for a chief economic rival, China, to expand its increasing dominance in the renewable energy industry.

Administration officials say the Trump administration is weeks away from announcing a new Cuba policy that would prohibit business with the Cuban military while maintaining the full diplomatic relations restored by Obama. ___ Google's Chrome browser to block some ads starting next year NEW YORK (AP) — Websites that run annoying ads such as pop-ups may find all ads blocked by Google's Chrome browser starting next year. The digital-ad giant's announcement comes as hundreds of millions of internet users have already installed ad blockers on their desktop computers and phones to combat ads that track them and make browsing sites difficult. ___ Retirees at GE plant in Canada see hope for health claims PETERBOROUGH, Ontario (AP) — Retired workers at a General Electric factory in Canada have long blamed cancers on decades spent in proximity to toxins inside the huge GE plant northeast of Toronto. Many had their health claims denied. But a newly published analysis of workplace safety at the Peterborough plant has prompted Ontario's labor minister to publicly back the retirees. ___ US trade deficit rises to highest level since January WASHINGTON (AP) —The U.S. trade deficit rose in April to the highest level since January as American exports rose and imports fell. The politically sensitive trade gap with China also rose sharply. A widening trade deficit is a drag on economic growth. Donald Trump made the trade gap a centerpiece of his presidential campaign. His administration has vowed to reduce the deficit, blaming it on abusive practices by America's trading partners. ___ The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 9.01 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,439.07.

BET SMH: Walmart's Insurance Company Is Clapping Back at Tracy Morgan Over Car Crash Settlement Share facebook twitter whatsapp tumblr pinterest email BET AWARDS New Shows BET EXPERIENCE SMH: Walmart's Insurance Company Is Clapping Back at Tracy Morgan Over Car Crash Settlement The superstore insurer is demanding the comedian turn over his medical records. Published 3 days ago The battle is not yet over between Tracy Morgan and Walmart as the superstore's insurance company is reportedly demanding that the comedian be grilled under oath regarding his alleged $90 million settlement stemming from the car crash that almost took his life back in 2014. According to the Daily Mail, though Walmart reached a deal with the former 30 Rock star a year after the incident, the company's insurer blasted the hasty settlement and stated that the superstore paid out the large amount without deposing neither Morgan nor others involved in the lawsuit. The site reports that lawyers for the insurance company, Ohio Casualty, are requesting that deposition dates be set up for Morgan and his friend Ardley Fuqua, who was a passenger in the car at the time of the accident. Through this process, Ohio Casualty is trying to force Morgan and Fuqua to submit settlement documents, medical records and other information related to the comedian's source of income. In addition to these, they are also requesting that all medical records from the accident, in general, Morgan's federal and state tax returns from 2009-2014, financial records regarding his earnings for the five years leading up to the accident and documents highlighting his future earning potential be handed over. That's not all. The company is also demanding that a list of medications he was prescribed after the crash, records of physical or mental examinations and documentation relating to his most recent appearances on Saturday Night Live and The Emmys be submitted. To back up their calls for a deposition, Ohio Casualty says this process is necessary and relevant as Morgan and Fuqua have received 92 percent of the hefty settlement paid out to the comedian's original lawsuit against the retail giant.

The limited curriculum is being produced by Strivr, a company previously known for helping NFL players train through VR. New Walmart employees will put on an Oculus Rift headset and enter different real-world scenarios, during which they’ll be asked to make simple choices based on what they see. Eventually, Strivr and Walmart hope to expand the program to all stores, not just the academies. Training simulators have been part of VR since the very beginning, but they’re more frequently associated with industrial labor or military training than with service work. The goal here, says Strivr CEO Derek Belch, is to put employees in scenarios that would be inconvenient to physically re-create — like dealing with spills, or preparing for a Black Friday shopping spree. “We literally know exactly where someone’s looking.” “We’re using computer vision to map scenes, so we literally know exactly where someone's looking,” says Belch. “If they don't look at [the right place] and press the button indicating that they have seen the stimuli that we're looking for, we know.” Wearers might look around an environment and find the spill, for example, then answer a multiple-choice question about what effect it could have on the store. One of the biggest problems for Strivr and Walmart is that high-end VR headsets like the Oculus Rift are expensive and space-consuming. That’s why, for now, only one person will go through the training at a time, while other people watch on a flat screen. Everybody will eventually get to spend time in VR, but only over the course of their two-week training period, with each session lasting between 5 and 20 minutes. “In a perfect world, everybody has a VR headset,” says Belch. “VR is not there yet. Even the mobile devices, there's a lot of challenges in getting that much hardware out into people's hands at scale.” So for now, VR is a small, supplemental part of Walmart training. But Belch thinks that we’ll see it expand rapidly. “This is something that we have talked openly with [Walmart] about, that very well could be at every Walmart store in a couple years,” he says. “You could imagine this area where there's a room in the back and there are three mobile headsets hanging on the wall, and employees have to go through continuing education every month, going through VR modules.” That’s right: if you work for Walmart, maybe soon you can enjoy Black Friday every month.

Employers added just 138,000 jobs in May, though that was enough to help cut the unemployment rate to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent. ——— Quitting Paris likely to have muted effect in key industries DALLAS (AP) — Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement may have only limited impact on key sectors in the economy. Some executives criticized the move. Analysts say market conditions will be a bigger factor in determining US energy production after Paris. ——— Pittsburgh to Trump: You don't speak for us on climate PITTSBURGH (AP) — In announcing plans to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord, President Donald Trump declared that he was "elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris." But the Steel City is hardly in Trump's corner on this one. Pittsburgh's mayor is reaffirming his commitment to curbing global warming and pushing ahead with green energy projects. ——— AP Explains: Why China is stepping up against climate change BEIJING (AP) — By backing off the U.S. commitment to address climate change, President Donald Trump leaves an opening for a chief economic rival, China, to expand its increasing dominance in the renewable energy industry. Here's a look at some of the trends and challenges that could shape China's — and the world's —energy future. ——— Stocks set records again; bond yields sink after jobs report NEW YORK (AP) — Bond yields sank Friday to their lowest level of the year, and the dollar's value fell against rivals after the nation's job growth slowed last month. But stock indexes chugged again to record heights, led by technology companies and dividend payers. ——— Walmart touts investment in people, technology as advantages FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) —Walmart CEO Doug McMillon touted the company's investments in people and technology at its shareholder meeting. He also said the company may have reached an employment peak and urged employees not to be afraid of automation. ——— Trump faces tough task unwinding Obama Cuba policy HAVANA (AP) —President Trump faces a complex scenario as Cuban-American legislators and lobbyists pressure him to fulfil his campaign promise to undo Obama's detente with the Cuba. Administration officials say the Trump administration is weeks away from announcing a new Cuba policy that would prohibit business with the Cuban military while maintaining the full diplomatic relations restored by Obama. ——— Google's Chrome browser to block some ads starting next year NEW YORK (AP) — Websites that run annoying ads such as pop-ups may find all ads blocked by Google's Chrome browser starting next year. The digital-ad giant's announcement comes as hundreds of millions of internet users have already installed ad blockers on their desktop computers and phones to combat ads that track them and make browsing sites difficult. ——— Retirees at GE plant in Canada see hope for health claims PETERBOROUGH, Ontario (AP) — Retired workers at a General Electric factory in Canada have long blamed cancers on decades spent in proximity to toxins inside the huge GE plant northeast of Toronto. Many had their health claims denied. But a newly published analysis of workplace safety at the Peterborough plant has prompted Ontario's labor minister to publicly back the retirees. ——— US trade deficit rises to highest level since January WASHINGTON (AP) —The U.S. trade deficit rose in April to the highest level since January as American exports rose and imports fell. The politically sensitive trade gap with China also rose sharply. A widening trade deficit is a drag on economic growth. Donald Trump made the trade gap a centerpiece of his presidential campaign. His administration has vowed to reduce the deficit, blaming it on abusive practices by America's trading partners. ——— The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 9.01 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,439.07. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 62.11, or 0.3 percent, to 21,206.29. The Nasdaq composite added 58.97, or 0.9 percent, to 6,305.80.

Abdus Abdullah Muhammad is shown on surveillance video footage. (Courtesy photo)  Charged is Abdus Abdullah Muhammad, 31, no permanent address. Township police said Muhammad entered the Wal-Mart, 3926 Nazareth Pike, and stole the televisions on April 18, May 24 and this past Sunday. During each theft, Muhammad loaded a shopping cart and walked out of the store without paying, police said. He stole an LG television valued at $498 on April 18; a Samsung television valued at $418 on May 24 and two Samsung televisions, totaling $1,176, this past Sunday, court records indicate. Investigators familiar with Muhammad said they reviewed store surveillance footage and tied him to the crime. Police also posted the surveillance photos from the alleged April theft on social media. Muhammad in a phone interview with police allegedly admitted to stealing the televisions, saying he needed to fuel a drug addiction. 31 parked cars had tires slashed in Bangor, cops say Muhammad later came to the police station and surrendered. Muhammad was arraigned Wednesday before District Judge Richard Yetter III, who set bail at $15,000. In lieu of bail he was taken to Northampton County Prison, where he remained Thursday.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Sheriff's officials ID men killed, wounded in Walmart shooting Wednesday Thursday Jun 1, 2017 at 2:34 PM Jun 1, 2017 at 5:31 PM Paola Baker Staff Writer @DP_PaolaBaker HESPERIA — Authorities released more details on the fatal officer-involved shooting in the Walmart Supercenter parking lot Wednesday morning, including the identities of the suspects involved. James Gleason, 24, of Phelan, was shot and killed by two officers assigned to the San Bernardino County Auto Theft Task Force (SANCATT) in the parking lot of the Walmart, 13401 Main Street, just after 8 a.m. Wednesday. Alexander Robert Herd, 31, of Phelan, was struck and wounded by the officers’ gunfire during the shooting. Gleason, Herd and a third Phelan man, identified as Austin Banuelos, 22, were reportedly attempting to steal a vehicle from the parking lot when the officers first approached them. The shooting occurred after an officer was nearly struck by the suspects’ vehicle, San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department spokeswoman Cindy Bachman said. The officers were conducting a separate stolen vehicle investigation in the parking lot of the Walmart early Wednesday morning when they first noticed the group. Bachman said the team used their unmarked vehicles to block in the suspects and prevent them from driving away. “The suspect driver accelerated, nearly striking one of the officers, and an officer-involved shooting occurred,” Bachman said. The vehicle, a dark green Honda, continued accelerating until it crashed into one of the unmarked vehicles. Gleason and Herd were struck and wounded during the shooting, according to Bachman, while Banuelos escaped injury. Gleason was taken to Desert Valley Hospital but was subsequently pronounced dead, authorities said. Herd was taken to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center where he was treated before getting arrested on suspicion of burglary Wednesday afternoon, authorities said.  Banuelos was detained and taken to the Hesperia Sheriff's Station for an interview, according to Bachman, where he was later arrested on suspicion of receiving stolen property. The vehicle the group was driving was reported stolen early Wednesday morning from a home in Victorville, Bachman said. Both Herd and Banuelos remain behind bars at the High Desert Detention Center. Herd remains in custody in lieu of $25,000 bail, booking records show, while a $50,000 bail was issued for Banuelos. Both men are expected to appear in court at 12:30 p.m. Friday. Court records show Herd is a felon who's been charged with several crimes, including several vehicle theft charges and convictions for burglary and grand theft. He was sentenced to 136 days in county jail in April 2016 after pleading no contest to a charge of vehicle theft, court records show. This investigation in ongoing and anyone with information regarding this investigation is urged to contact Specialized Investigation Division Detective Chuck Phillips at 909-387-3589.

(AP) — In its latest effort to compete with online giant Amazon, Walmart is testing a delivery service using its own store employees, who will deliver packages ordered online while driving home from their regular work shifts.   The "associate delivery" program would use Walmart's 4,700 U.S. stores and roughly 1.2 million employees to speed delivery and cut costs, the company said Thursday. The announcement came just a day before the company's annual meeting.   The world's largest retailer says workers can choose to participate and would be paid. The service is being tested at two stores in New Jersey and one in Arkansas.   Walmart has stores within 10 miles of 90 percent of the U.S. population, the company says.   "Now imagine all the routes our associates drive to and from work and the houses they pass along the way," Marc Lore, CEO of Walmart's U.S. online operations, wrote on the company website.   Ravi Jariwala, a Walmart spokesman, said all those employees driving home represent a "very dense web" of potential delivery locations for the company.   Employees who want to participate will be able to use an app to specify how many packages they are willing to deliver, Jariwala said, as well as the weight and size limits on the packages. Jariwala would not provide details about how workers would be paid, but said the company would comply with all federal and state minimum wage and overtime laws.   "This is completely an opt-in program," he said Thursday. "This is not something they are required to do."   So far, employees "love having the option to earn more cash while doing something that's already part of their daily routine," Lore wrote.   Some critics of Walmart's labor practices questioned how voluntary such a program will be.   "When so many workers are paid so little that they need government assistance to make ends meet, it becomes a necessity, not a choice, to do what they can to earn more," said Randy Parraz, director of Making Change at Walmart, a group funded by the United Food and Commercial Workers.   The move could result in significant cost savings, though the company didn't provide estimates of how much. Still, the final delivery step to a customer's home — what the industry refers to as the "last mile" — "makes up the lion's share of fulfillment costs," Jariwala said.   The move is the latest step in Walmart's campaign to counter Amazon's online dominance. Shoppers on Walmart.com can already choose to pick up items at a nearby store for a lower price. Walmart has also revamped its shipping program and offers free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase of $35.   In its tests so far, Walmart says "many" packages are arriving at customers' homes just a day after an order has been placed.   Participating employees will have to undergo background checks and a check on their driving records, Jariwala said.   Faster shipping has become a key area of competition as online retail continues to grow at a double-digit pace, while traditional brick-and-mortar stores struggle with falling sales.   Members of Amazon's $99-a-year Prime service in thousands of areas can receive orders the same day or the next, depending on the item and location. And in about 30 cities, Prime Now members can get some items in an hour or two.   Walmart has previously tested delivery services using Uber drivers. Jariwala said that test is still going on.   But Lore noted that the employee delivery service would save a step compared with third-party services that require a driver to travel to a store to pick up a good, then deliver it, then return home. Walmart workers would simply travel from the store they already work at to make the delivery.

The program is being tested with general merchandise in two stores in New Jersey and one in Arkansas. The test is about a month old, and Wal-Mart won't say whether it's planning to roll it out. Employees can make extra money by delivering the packages, but Walmart.com spokesman Ravi Jariwala didn't share how employees are being compensated, other than to say it's in addition to their regular shift pay. So far, he said, "hundreds of deliveries are showing up the next day."  Wal-Mart sees it as another way to leverage its 4,700 stores across the U.S., Jariwala said. One of its stores is within 10 minutes of 90 percent of Americans.  How much do Dallas-Fort Worth shoppers like buying groceries online? Just ask Wal-Mart Jariwala said it's too early to talk about cost savings that may come with employee deliveries versus other ways it gets packages to customers' homes. Wal-Mart uses all the major delivery services such as FedEx and UPS and it has another delivery test now with Uber and Lyft. As e-commerce has grown, retailers have talked about the last mile to your house as being the most expensive part of the delivery. That's why pickup in stores is encouraged and offered for free by so many major chains including Wal-Mart. In the test, trucks that deliver to stores from distribution centers also carry online orders for both Walmart.com and Jet.com to the store near those customers. The program is voluntary and employees "are in control of the experience," Jariwala said. Employees must submit to background checks that include motor vehicle reports to become eligible. A common response from employees, Jarawali said, is "You mean I get paid for driving home?" An application shows the packages that are available for delivery on the way home. Only deliveries on the employee's path appear as options. The employee can decide what size and weight package and how many deliveries. Employees also chose what days they want to take on deliveries. Packages not claimed that day by an employee are shifted to a third-party carrier. A map showing dots where employees live and where deliveries were going for one recent day revealed extensive overlap. "It just makes sense," said Marc Lore, CEO of Wal-Mart's e-commerce division. "We already have trucks moving orders from fulfillment centers to stores for pickup. Those same trucks could be used to bring ship-to-home orders to a store close to their final destination." Lore called it a game-changer in Wal-Mart's ability to use its stores to move ahead in e-commerce. Wal-Mart's same-store sales have increased for 11 consecutive quarters. Last month, it reported a first-quarter sales increase of 1.4 percent, which beat estimates. The company's e-commerce sales increased 63 percent. While Wal-Mart has made e-commerce acquisitions, the retailer said most of the online business gains were from Walmart.com. Earlier this year, it went after Amazon's Prime member customers by lowering the minimum purchase to $25 for two-day free shipping. Wal-Mart's online strategy has taken a leap forward with its purchase of Jet.com, which Lore founded. Other recent e-commerce acquisitions include shoe retailer Shoebuy, women's apparel retailer ModCloth and outdoor gear retailer Moosejaw.

Fallon/Bloomberg News Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is testing a program that sends store employees to deliver online orders at the end of their shifts, a new push by the world’s biggest retailer to use its large physical footprint to match Amazon.com Inc.’s convenient options for web purchases. Workers can opt in to earn extra money by making deliveries using their own cars. They’re assigned packages based on where they live so the route aligns with their commute home, the company said June 1 in a blog post. Wal-Mart didn’t specify how the employees will be compensated. The test began at three locations in Arkansas and New Jersey. Wal-Mart ranks No. 3 on the Transport Topics Top 100 list of the largest private carriers in North America. Wal-Mart is tapping into its 4,700 U.S. stores and more than a million retail employees as it seeks to redefine itself in an age of e-commerce dominated by Amazon, which offers delivery of some products in as little as an hour in some cities. Online spending will increase by 16% this year — more than four times the pace of overall retail — to reach $462 billion, according to EMarketer Inc. About 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Wal-Mart, and the company is using those locations as shipping hubs to compete with Amazon on the last mile of delivery — the most expensive part of getting goods to customers. By using existing workers in their own cars, Wal-Mart could create a vast network with little upfront cost, similar to how Uber Technologies Inc. created a ride-hailing service without owning any cars. "Imagine all the routes our associates drive to and from work and the houses they pass along the way," said Marc Lore, who took over Wal-Mart’s e-commerce operation last year after the retailer purchased his startup, Jet.com, for $3.3 billion. "This test could be a game-changer." Many online orders in tests have been delivered overnight using store employees, Lore said, showing how the initiative could also be used to narrow delivery times. The lines between internet and brick-and-mortar commerce are blurring as retailers — including Amazon — try to accommodate a variety of shopping preferences. Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart offers free two-day delivery on millions of items to compete with Amazon’s standard delivery time. It also lets customers buy groceries online and pick them up at stores and offers discounts to online shoppers who pick up items at stores rather than having them delivered. Amazon, meanwhile, has stepped up its experimentation with physical locations. It’s slowly opening physical bookstores in big cities around the U.S., which double as showrooms for Amazon gadgets such as its Kindle readers and Echo voice-activated speakers. The company opened two drive-in grocery pickup kiosks in its hometown of Seattle earlier this month, its first attempt to match the click-and-collect options rolled out by Wal-Mart and other big-box competitors.

Amato-McCoy While the industry continues to explore how to leverage virtual reality, Walmart is embracing the technology in a big way.   The retail giant will be adding VR-based instruction at its 200 Walmart Academy training centers in the United States by the end of the year. The technology will be used to educate approximately 140,000 employees that go through the program each year, according to Walmart.   Each location will have an Oculus Rift headset and gaming PC that will showcase a collection of VR training content. The content is being created by STRIVR Labs, a start-up that already creates training videos for sports teams, including the Dallas Cowboys, San Francisco 49ers, and the U.S. Ski Team.   In fact, it was a Walmart executive’s love of football that sparked the idea. While watching the University of Arkansas football team practice, Brock McKeel, Walmart’s senior director of central operations, was inspired by how the athletes were interacting with the VR technology during practice, and using it to test their skills and reactions in real-life scenarios. It was this discovery — and discussions with one of the coaches – this pushed McKeel to pursue how to apply VR to training at Walmart.   Currently, the technology is available in 30 academies. Associates who have gone through VR training retain what they’ve learned in those situations better than those who haven’t, reported Beth Harris, Walmart spokeswoman.   “We used it to train our associates to handle situations from the everyday, like managing the fresh area, to the rare, like Black Friday,” she explained. “VR allows associates to experience a lifelike store environment to experiment, learn and handle difficult situations without the need to recreate disruptive incidents or disturb the customers’ shopping experience.” Login or Register to post a comment. ﻿ Newsletter Sign Up Get the latest news sent to your inbox   Popular Most Commented Philly tops list of 10 most affordable retail locations BJ's adds former Belk and Dick's Sporting Goods execs to its leadership team Gymboree names retail veteran as CEO The top five breakout trends in shopping centers are… Five in-store amenities helping to drive traffic and engagement Dollar Tree comes out on top Restaurant giant in $1.8 billion acquisition German grocery giant to make a big U.S. debut ahead of schedule Study: Retailers leave money on table due to lack of personalized service Whole Foods Market disappoints Solutions Spotlight The New Era of "Responsive Retail" As the Internet of Things continues to drive the next era of retail, companies need to be ready to embrace these technologies as a means of meeting its digital shoppers’ evolving demands.

Issues & Trends>Food Safety Walmart: Blockchain tech a boon for food safety Test provides rapid view of farm to store; big safety, waste implications Jon Springer | Jun 01, 2017 Wal-Mart Stores on Thursday revealed encouraging results of a test of blockchain technology to aid food traceability and safety, demonstrating it could cut the time involved in tracing the journey of food products from the farm to its shelves from nearly a week to less than three seconds. The test, in partnership with IBM, began last year in China, and could have wide-ranging benefits for Walmart and the larger food industry to tackle the cost of food waste, more quickly identify and contain foodborne illnesses and fraud and facilitate compliance with safety regulations, while meeting customer demand for transparency in the food system, Frank Yiannas, VP of food safety for Walmart, said Thursday in a presentation as part of the retailer’s annual Shareholders Week events in Bentonville, Ark. Related story: Walmart: Happy employees sparking sales momentum And though the program has benefits for Walmart that could result in lower prices, fresher in-store product and more efficient logistics, Yiannas said the company did not intend to use blockchain as a competitive advantage and instead encouraged participation from suppliers, other retailers and stakeholders along the food chain. IBM VP Brigid McDermot discusses blockchain technology at the Walmart presentation. Blockchain technology provides a permanent record of transactions that are grouped in digital “blocks” and cannot be altered, said Brigid McDermott, VP of IBM’s blockchain business development. Applied to food safety, it could serve as an alternative to traditional paper records and manual inspection systems that Yiannas said could leave supply chains vulnerable to inaccuracy or fraud. “While we are enamored and really excited about the blockchain technology that’s enabling us to do this, really there are business challenges we’re trying to solve.” “It’s been reported that a 1% reduction in foodborne disease in the U.S. would amount to about a $700 billion saving to the U.S. economy,” Yiannas said. “But it’s more than just cost, it’s people. The CDC [Centers for Disease Control] estimates that about 48 million Americans will experience foodborne illness in the U.S., and the global numbers are even larger.” About one-third of produced food goes to waste, he added, costing U.S. businesses $29 billion annually. Walmart tested the blockchain solution in China using pork, and in the U.S. using mangoes, digitally tracking them farm to store using a scan. Product information, such as details of the farm, batch numbers, factory and processing data, expiration dates and shipping details, is digitally connected to the items. In a demonstration of the technology, tracking information inputted to the software from a label on a package of sliced mangoes -- a process Yiannas said took nearly seven days using previous methods -- revealed their origins to two farms in Mexico and their stops along the way, in 2.2 seconds.

(File image (Thinkstock)) Print Email The Washington Post By The Washington Post The Times-Picayune Follow on Twitter on June 01, 2017 at 2:26 PM comments A 16-year-old girl was carrying a machete in one hand, a knife in the other, as she walked "nonchalantly" out of a Walmart store in the Chicago suburb of Lincolnwood without paying at about 3 a.m. Tuesday, prosecutors said. The girl, Eliza Wasni, called for an Uber ride - her third that night - and a driver pulled up in a silver Hyundai Sonata. Wasni climbed into the car. About two minutes later, as the car reached an intersection a few blocks away, she began stabbing and hacking at the driver from the back seat, prosecutors said at a news conference. The bleeding driver, 34-year-old Grant Nelson, managed to pull the car into a nearby condominium building driveway. He ran to the lobby entrance, banged on the door and screamed. "Help me," Nelson shouted, "Help me, I'm going to die." Meanwhile, Wasni allegedly tried to flee by taking the wheel of the car, but soon rammed into a median and took off on foot. After residents called 911, police arrived to find a bloodstained car, and a trail of blood leading from the parkway around the side of the building. There they found Nelson in the grass in a pool of his own blood, suffering from deep stab wounds and hacking wounds to his arms, side, head and chest. He was coherent enough to describe his assailant to police and what happened, but he would later die in a hospital. Police found Wasni after identifying her from the Uber app on the driver's phone, which he left in the car. She was crouching behind a building near where she'd abandoned the car, holding a machete in one hand and knife in the other. She wore only a bra and leggings - a Chicago Cubs shirt was found nearby, the Chicago Tribune reported. When she repeatedly refused to drop her weapons, police used a stun gun on her and took her into custody. They would later find surveillance video from Walmart capturing Wasni stealing the weapons while wearing a Cubs shirt. Authorities charged Wasni as an adult with first-degree murder, the Chicago Tribune reported. A judge called the attack "extremely violent" and ordered her to be held without bail. She will be held in a juvenile facility, the Tribune reported. She appeared in court Wednesday in a white jail jumpsuit, her blond hair disheveled and her eyes kept mostly to the floor. Prosecutors called the attack "heinous" and "not provoked in any manner." Wasni lives with a single mother and is a student at Taft High School in Chicago, her public defender said in court, according to the Chicago Tribune. She was in violation of the company's 18-and-older age restriction for riders. Access to the service can be removed if a rider is found to be underage. An Uber spokeswoman said in a statement to the Chicago Tribune the company is "heartbroken by the loss of one of our partners, Grant Nelson. Our deepest sympathies and prayers are with his family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time." The ride-hailing company - embattled from a number of recent internal struggles and controversies - has previously made headlines regarding allegations that its drivers assaulted passengers. And the shocking incident spurred the question: why would a teenage girl - seemingly unprovoked - brutally attack a complete stranger? Grant Nelson's sister, Alex Nelson, said in a news conference Wednesday the details of the attack were "horrifying and saddening," and that "obviously this is a time of heartbreak and tremendous loss for us." "Grant was an extraordinary figure in our lives," she said. "He was a gentle man. He was a good man." Grant Nelson, who lived with his parents in Wilmette, just north of Chicago, had a wide range of interests - from animals to classical opera to military history. "We don't have any answers," Alex Nelson said.

Instead of buying vans or hiring professional delivery workers, Walmart has started asking its sales associates, stock clerks and cashiers to use their own cars to deliver online purchases to nearby customers. The employees make the drop-offs on their way home after their shifts. “Associates love having the option to earn more cash while doing something that’s already part of their daily routine,” crowed Marc Lore, president and chief executive of Walmart’s US e-commerce business, in a blog post on Thursday. Lore said the employees would deliver packages only to customers whose homes they normally pass. Lore did not say how the employees would be compensated — or if gas or insurance would be paid for. Employee deliveries are now being tested at some stores in Arkansas and New Jersey. The delivery program is voluntary for store workers and allows them to sign up for a maximum of 10 deliveries a day. The move comes as the discounter — and scores of other retailers — look to keep up with online retailers, like Amazon, which promise quick delivery. Walmart is trying to make its 4,700-strong network of brick-and-mortar stores and 1 million employees into an asset. Ninety percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart. “This is another example of Walmart trying to cut corners,” said Nelson Lichtenstein, director of the Center for the Study of Work, Labor and Democracy at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “It’s bizarre that this gigantic company is doing something that a five-and-dime shop would have asked its employees to do decades ago.” Lore hailed the fact that the initiative will “cut shipping costs and get packages to their final destinations faster and more efficiently.” Indeed, Walmart will face few up-front costs — like buying a fleet of trucks — as employees already own their cars. In tapping its employees, Walmart cuts out the middleman — companies like Instacart that take a cut for their delivery services. Lore joined the company in August when Walmart bought his former company, Jet.com, for $3 billion. He has helped Walmart to more aggressively compete against Amazon and referred to the delivery test as a “game-changer.” Others questioned whether shoppers wouldn’t find it strange to have some “random Walmart employee coming to your house,” said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough. Investors didn’t seem to have such qualms. Walmart’s shares closed up 1.5 percent on Thursday, to $79.81. “Delivery is the buzzword on Wall Street right now,” Yarbrough said. “It gets everyone excited.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under amazon ,  amazon prime ,  delivery services ,  online shopping ,  walmart Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Ex-Morgan Stanley trader barred for hiding Venezuela bond ...

Published 3 days ago Police in Chicago arrested and charged a teenage girl for the fatal stabbing of an Uber driver on Tuesday. 16-year-old Eliza Wasni is being held without bail in a Cook County jail for the "heinous" killing of Grant Nelson, 34, reported the Chicago Tribune. According to prosecutors, Nelson — who drove a Hyundai — picked up Wasni near a Walmart and started driving to her destination. Just minutes into the ride, Wasni allegedly started hacking away at Nelson with a machete. Nelson pulled over the car and ran into the lobby of a nearby condominium building. "Help me, help me. I'm going to die," Nelson yelled, according Assistant State's Attorney Michelle Cunningham. Wasni then reportedly drove off in Nelson’s car until she hit a median and started running on foot. Later on, police found Wasni wearing only a bra and leggings. Nelson’s bloody trail led officers to find him in the lobby of the building. In addition to using the app to identify Wasni, police were given a description of the teen by Nelson, who died shortly after in a hospital. During their investigation, police viewed surveillance footage which reportedly showed Wasni walking around the Walmart where she was picked up with a knife and machete. Wasni did not pay for the items, prosecutors said. Wasni will be held in a juvenile facility until her trial. However, she has been charged as an adult with first-degree murder, according to an official with the Cook County sheriff's office. On Wednesday, an Uber spokeswoman issued a statement, saying, “[Uber is] heartbroken by the loss of one of our partners, Grant Nelson.

The program, now available in two New Jersey stores and one store in Northwest Arkansas, can cut shipping costs and get purchases to customers faster, according to Marc Lore, chief executive of Walmart WMT, -0.24%   U.S. e-commerce. “Many orders are being delivered the next day,” he wrote in a post on the company’s blog, published on Thursday. Associates can opt into the program if they choose, and use technology that Lore says the company built to set preferences such as how many packages they want to deliver, weight limits for the packages, and which days they’d like to deliver packages.

With shoppers moving their purchasing activity online, traditional retailers are looking for ways to leverage store locations for e-commerce growth and convenience. In April, Wal-Mart began offering discounts to some online purchases that customers pick up from stores. In January, Wal-Mart ended its ShippingPass subscription pilot and instead announced that it would offer free shipping on minimum purchases of $35, down from $50. Since then, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.08%   has lowered the free shipping threshold to $25 from $35 for non-Prime members, and Target Corp. TGT, -0.25%   raised its threshold to $35 from $25.

Wal-Mart shares closed Thursday up 1.5%, and are up 13.3% for the past three months. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.37%   is up 1.4% for the last three months.

I’m going to die,” driver Grant Nelson screamed Tuesday as he frantically pushed buzzers in a condominium lobby in Lincolnwood, Ill., Assistant State Attorney Michelle Cunningham said in court, the Chicago Tribune reported. SEE ALSO Teen charged with fatally stabbing her Uber driver 0:0 LINCOLNWOOD, Ill. — A 16-year-old girl was charged Wednesday as... Moments before, prosecutors said, Nelson, 34, picked up Eliza Wasni near a Walmart in Skokie, and just a few minutes into their ride, the teen allegedly began stabbing him with a knife and machete she stole from Walmart. He later died. Wasni, 16, fled in Nelson’s Hyundai Sonata but struck a median and bolted on foot, the prosecutor said. When cops found the girl, she was wearing only a bra and leggings. A bloodstained Chicago Cubs shirt was discovered nearby. Police told her to drop her weapons but “she didn’t acknowledge them,” according to the Chicago Sun-Times. She was then hit with a stun gun and arrested. Cops also found the bloody trail Nelson left while running to the lobby. Nelson told police a passenger had stabbed him before he died at a nearby hospital. Using the Uber app on Nelson’s phone, police determined that a passenger named “Eliza” had been his most recent customer. The teen was also caught on Walmart surveillance video walking around the store with the knife and machete and leaving without paying for them. In the hours before the attack, she’d taken two Uber rides — one to a train station in Des Plaines and another from Des Plaines to Walmart — in violation of the ride-sharing company’s policy that requires passengers to be 18 or older. Wasni, who is charged with first-degree murder, was held without bail after a court appearance Wednesday. The homicide is Lincolnwood’s first in 11 years, officials said.

On May 3 at around 4:36 p.m., the woman pictured in this article was seen placing multiple items into her cart, including power drills, toys, clothing and other household goods. She was wearing a blue hat and black tank top and had a toddler in her cart. She reportedly left the store at around 5:16 p.m. without attempting to pay for any of the items. Loss prevention attempted to stop her but did not pursue beyond the store. The suspect placed the stolen items into an unknown vehicle parked near the store's garden center. Investigators say the same woman, now wearing a UGA hat and red and white floral dress, reentered the Walmart just ten minutes later. She had the same toddler with her. The suspect reportedly filled her cart once again and left the store at around 5:50 p.m. Walmart loss prevention says she stole approximately $800 worth of merchandise. The same woman reportedly came back to the Grovetown Walmart on May 5 at around 6:03 p.m. and attempted to leave without paying for the approximately $300 worth of groceries and other items in her cart. She was stopped by an employee and stayed for a moment in customer service before leaving the store. If you have any information about this case or can identify this woman, please contact the Columbia County Sheriff's Office. Copyright 2017 WFXG. All rights reserved.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Abha Bhattarai By Abha Bhattarai June 1 Follow @abhabhattarai Walmart held its annual shareholders meeting, a day after the company said it's testing a program that allows store workers to deliver packages to customers. (Reuters) BENTONVILLE, Ark. — Walmart’s newest tactic in its fight against online giant Amazon: enlisting its employees to deliver online orders on their way home from work. The idea, Walmart executives said Thursday, is to cut costs on the so-called last-mile of deliveries, when packages are driven to customers’ homes, often the most expensive part of the fulfillment process. “It just makes sense: We already have trucks moving orders from fulfillment centers to stores for pickup,” Marc Lore, chief executive of Walmart’s e-commerce business and the founder of Jet.com, said in a blog post Thursday afternoon. “Those same trucks could be used to bring ship-to-home orders to a store close to their final destination, where a participating associate can sign up to deliver them to the customer’s house.” The company began testing the package-delivery program a month ago in three stores — two in New Jersey, one in northwest Arkansas — but did not offer details on when, or where, it would expand across the United States. Employees will be paid extra for the voluntary program, and offered overtime pay as necessary to make the deliveries, Walmart spokesman Ravi Jariwala said Thursday. “Walmart is uniquely qualified, uniquely positioned, to be able to offer this,” he said, adding that 90 percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store. “There is really strong overlap between where our associates are already heading after work and where those packages need to go.” Former Walmart CEO describes how to build a scalable business and maintain a culture of innovation (TWP) The company is billing the program as a way for employees to earn extra money, although there were few details on how they would be paid. Jariwala declined to clarify whether employees would be paid based on distance, time, number of deliveries or a combination of those things. [Walmart is preparing to take on Amazon. But first, parachuting M&M’s.] Labor experts say the arrangement, a mash-up of sorts between an Uber-style gig economy and traditional employment arrangements, raises a number of questions related to employees having to shoulder much of the risk, cost and liability associated with deliveries. “The practice seems ripe for abuse if the company does not compensate workers for the full cost of their journey, the expenses related to gas, car depreciation, and potential problems like accidents, tickets or parking expenses,” said Stephanie Luce, a labor professor at the City University of New York. “Like other ‘gig economy’ type jobs, there is a potential to benefit workers — but in reality, most of the benefits accrue to the employer, not the employee.” Earlier this year, Walmart — which last year reported $485.9 billion in revenue — said it would raise its hourly minimum wage to $10 for most workers, but activist groups say many employees are still struggling to make ends meet. “Instead of Walmart paying its workers what they deserve for their work, Walmart is merely offering to pay more — for more work,” said Randy Parraz, director of Making Change at Walmart, a campaign run by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. “To say this is a voluntary program is like throwing a life preserver to someone drowning in a lake,” he added. “When so many workers are paid so little that they need government assistance to make ends meet, it becomes a necessity, not a choice, to do what they can to earn more.” Some Walmart employees were also skeptical of the arrangement, particularly given the lack of specifics. “Without understanding if associates are going to be compensated for gas, additional insurance costs, wear and tear on our cars and the potential risks of delivering packages, this program could be creating problems for associates,” said Cynthia Murray, a Walmart employee in Laurel, Md., who leads the Organization United for Respect Walmart, a workers’ activist group. “While Walmart continues to point to its 1.5 million associates as its advantage over companies like Amazon, we also know that they are not doing enough to support us and our families.” This isn’t the first time Walmart has enlisted others to deliver its goods. Four years ago, executives told Reuters they were toying with the idea of having customers deliver packages to online shoppers in exchange for a discount. The company also partners with ride-sharing services like Uber, Lyft and Deliv to deliver groceries in Phoenix, Denver and Miami. “We think crowdsourcing is a mechanism of the future, and frankly, as you think about the move to driverless [vehicles], that could also make the cost of delivery lower,” Scott Price, chief administrative officer of Walmart International, said Thursday. “The inefficiency of delivery can destroy profitability.” Thursday’s announcement comes as Walmart doubles down on its online business, where sales grew 63 percent in the first quarter of this year. The company — long the country’s largest retailer — has taken aggressive steps in the past year, beginning with its $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com to compete with Amazon.com, which accounts for about 33 percent of the country’s online sales. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) Walmart has also been rapidly expanding its grocery pickup program, in which shoppers retrieve online orders in the parking lots of a nearby store. More recently, the company has begun offering discounts on certain digital purchases if customers opt to pick them up in-store. In that model, Walmart uses its own trucking fleet to deliver packages to stores, tapping into an existing transportation network. Amazon.com is also making similar efforts to speed up delivery. The Seattle-based company in recent months has leased a fleet of 40 cargo jets, and has developed an Amazon-branded trucking fleet. It also created Amazon Flex, an on-demand network of drivers, similar to Uber or Lyft. Walmart employees, Jariwala said, have delivered hundreds of packages during the past month, fulfilling orders placed on Jet.com, which Walmart acquired last year, as well as Walmart’s own website. Walmart employees can sign up for up to 10 deliveries per day using a company app, Jariwala said. They can also set size and weight limits on packages. If there are not enough employees to deliver packages, carriers like UPS and FedEx would fill in. “This is completely an opt-in program,” he said. “This is not something associates are required to do. They are, first and foremost, always going to finish their shift.” Sarah Halzack contributed to this report.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Is More Consolidation Coming to the Consumer and Retail Industry? Major acquisition talks make headlines as American Eagle pursues its apparel rival Abercrombie & Fitch, and Kraft-Heinz eyes a mega-deal with Colgate-Palmolive. Asit Sharma (TMFfinosus) Jun 1, 2017 at 12:10PM Reports are surfacing that Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) is in ongoing talks with multiple entities for an acquisition, and that Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) is looking to roll another major consumer goods company into its portfolio. In this episode of Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, Vincent Shen and senior Fool.com contributor Asit Sharma take a look at these potential deals -- find out who is looking to buy out the teen-focused apparel brand, and why the leadership behind Kraft Heinz is so eager to pursue another multi-billion dollar acquisition. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on May 30, 2017. Vincent Shen: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. I'm your host, Vincent Shen, and it's Tuesday, May 30th. I hope everyone enjoyed their holiday weekend. If you haven't heard yesterday's special "Behind the Curtain" episode of Industry Focus, check it out to learn more about the team and what it's like in the studio. For today's discussion of potential merger and acquisition activity in the consumer and retail world, I've recruited senior Fool.com contributor Asit Sharma to join the show. Hey, Asit, thanks for calling in. How was your weekend, man? Asit Sharma: It was wonderful, very relaxing, a long four days, the highlight of which, I beat my middle child 15 year old in one-on-one basketball. Chalk one up for Father Time. How about you? Shen: Very nice. I was talking to Austin before the show. We got rained out a few times. I was up in New York. Did you guys have to deal with that at all in North Carolina? Sharma: No. We got a little bit of cloud cover here and there. It was just a gorgeous weekend. So, we escaped some serious rain. It was very pretty. Shen: Alright. I'm glad you had a good weekend and were able to show your son that you still have what it takes in the court. Sharma: I still got it, thanks. Shen: Kicking off our discussion for today, we have recent reports that American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO) is considering a potential acquisition of its apparel rival, Abercrombie & Fitch. These are both apparel brands focused on teenage and young adult consumers, with stores largely located in malls all across the country. So, retail weakness and headwinds have been in the headlines quite often and discussed on the show. We have a series of bankruptcies from other mall-based chains hit the news recently, including Wet Seal, Aeropostale, American Apparel and BCBG. And with the Coach-Kate Spade deal announced a few weeks ago, we're also seeing some consolidation in the apparel space, as well. So, Asit, there are a lot of moving pieces and potential suitors right now who are pursuing this deal, and I would like to cover this one at a time. To start things off, can you give us a quick rundown of what has been going on in Abercrombie? The stock enjoyed a $7 billion market cap a decade ago, and has since declined to about a tenth of that size. Annual revenue peaked at $4.5 billion. That is down to $3.3 billion last year. What happened? Sharma: One of the things that you and I talked about in regards to retail companies is having a market that's strong enough to pull your product through. Retailers who are focused on the teen segment work with fickle fashion gods. Going back to the weekend briefly, I went with my family and saw the Pirates of the Caribbean. The gods of the sea are fearsome, there's curse after curse, and you have trouble, sitting in the theater, unraveling which curse is directed at whom and how do they break it? But they're nothing compared to the fashion gods, especially where teens are concerned. The fashion gods are brutal. This company has been in an industry in which it enjoyed a long surge of interest in mall-based traffic, and teens propelled that for years. As you and I discussed many times, online has shifted the retail landscape. Mall traffic has disappeared, and Abercrombie & Fitch, along with many of its retail brethren, is locked into long-term operating leases and purchase commitments for material and leases that are based in malls, which are quite expensive, not very lucrative if you're trying to break them. It's stuck in this fixed cost position with that smaller traffic base. On top of that, the company has had to try to move with the fashion trends, and it's been out-hustled by the fashion-forward fast fashion houses like Zara, which have a lower economic footprint, a lighter capital footprint, change their fashions much more quickly. So it's really a victim of a couple of these larger forces. Operationally, the company has done a decent job. It was always somewhat profitable. That profit margin has now declined to near flat. But it's in a fairly liquid position. And a little bit later, we'll get into the differences between liquidity and solvency, which is speaking to Abercrombie & Fitch's long-term future. Basically, we're looking at entrenched trends that this company is trying to battle against with not a bright outlook looking forward. Shen: Thanks, Asit, that's a really great rundown of what the company has been facing. I think, as you mentioned, it's really important to note that Abercrombie & Fitch is not alone in this. We've mentioned some of the other chains that have declared bankruptcy or closed their doors. These are headwinds that a lot of these mall-based stores are facing. Abercrombie, for four years running, the revenue has declined about 6% to 9% each year. I'd like to run down a list of different things that management has tried to do to face declining traffic to its stores, but also the changing trends. It has recently announced that it will be closing dozens of its stores, about 60 of its U.S. locations. In 2014, they tried to rebrand, going from the big logos on its clothes, seeing that now, places like Zara and H&M, these fast fashion houses, they give you less branding and logos on their clothes so that you can design your own style, that seems to be what's popular with their customers. So, rebranding itself a few years ago, changing the look of its fashion. They're trying to market to older shoppers, moving away a little bit from their core teenage base. And they've also recently ousted Mike Jeffries, who was the former CEO who kind of put Abercrombie & Fitch on the map, taking over the brand in the early 90s when it was part of The Limited conglomerate. They've also implemented other changes to its executive team and the board of directors. One thing I will note in terms of bright spots for the company, it's not all bad, in that they have their Hollister business, which is actually, at this point, a bigger part of revenue than the namesake Abercrombie & Fitch brand is. But that has at least managed to maintain flat same-store sales. So, you can see, even in this situation, flat is better than the double-digit same-stores sales declines that they've seen with the Abercrombie brand. They also recently announced a wholesale partnership with Asian e-commerce retailer Zalora, to sell its merchandise, which I thought was an interesting way for the company to expand its international reach.  Next up I want to establish a little bit of a timeline for what we know so far regarding the buyout process, and the negotiations that are going on between Abercrombie & Fitch and the potential buyers. On May 9th, the company confirmed that it has employed an investment bank to help navigate buyout talks with multiple interested parties. The following day, some initial reports indicated that at least two of the interested buyers for Abercrombie & Fitch were American Eagle and Express (NYSE:EXPR). In the meantime, Abercrombie shares initially jumped over 12% on the news, before gradually losing those gains until an update made headlines last week. Last week, May 24th, there was news from American Eagle, which not only was still interested in a deal, but it may be presenting a joint offer with Cerberus Capital, which is a private equity fund known for its interest in these distressed businesses. I think it would be fair to say Abercrombie is part of that category.  So, the named suitors we have so far potentially negotiating this deal include Express, American Eagle, and Cerberus, and there are likely other entities as well. Express -- just a breakdown of who some of these potential suitors are -- is actually a smaller business than Abercrombie. It has a market cap of just over $600 million, Abercrombie is about $850 million. The revenue in Express' most recent fiscal year was $2.2 billion. Abercrombie's was closer to about $3.3 billion. So, if the companies were to agree to a deal, it would be more so a merger of equals, with a combination of probably cash and stock-based consideration. But, if I were a gambling man, I would have to put my chips on American Eagle and Cerberus rather than this deal, just because I think they have the more substantial resources, and also the aesthetic and branding fit that's more complementary between the two brands. Asit, if you're an American Eagle shareholder and you see this news, how are you thinking about this acquisition and evaluating it? Sharma: I think you're pleased. If you're an American Eagle shareholder, then you, too, have seen the ravages of the retail industry in recent years, especially if you've held the stock for quite a while. But, looking at American Eagle's balance sheet, the company has around $225 million worth of cash. It's liquid. What does liquidity mean? Liquidity means that you have enough current assets on hand to cover your short-term obligations. It's also solvent, meaning that American Eagle doesn't have a lot of debt. However, because that profit margin has declined in recent years, I think last year's net profit margin was just over 5%, the company isn't really throwing off enough cash flow to cover its own operations, grow its business, and then take over an Abercrombie & Fitch. So, you must be pleased that this very deep-pocketed private equity firm, Cerberus Capital, is stepping in. Without that, it's going to be a tough deal for American Eagle.  Looking at the market capitalization, Vince, you mentioned that Abercrombie's market cap is down to about $850 million. That looks sort of doable if you only look at the market cap. But American Eagle needs this private investor because there's more to the price tag of Abercrombie than meets the eye. Abercrombie has about $2.2 billion worth of long-term commitments. These are those operating store leases that I spoke about, and also materials purchased obligations for their inventory. That's a pretty big balance that you have to add on to the market cap, because whoever buys this company is on the hook for those obligations. When you look at total value, enterprise value, it's over about $3 billion, somewhere between $3 billion to $4 billion, once you consider some type of premium for the shares. Hooking up with a very well-resourced private equity group will help American Eagle not just acquire the company, but have the resources to realize the synergies that you mentioned, the fact that the product lines are similar, much more complementary than an Express and an Abercrombie. So, I think you have to be feeling pretty good if you are an American Eagle shareholder. But still, this larger question looms -- once you can buy into .these two companies, the same problem still exists. They have to find a way to reinvent themselves as a merged-up entity. What are your thoughts, Vince, on how these two companies potentially can combine and make something better out of these two parts?  Shen: I've been thinking about some of the synergies, always a buzzword behind a deal like this, in terms of what these companies can realize. Definitely, the obvious benefits that jump to mind for any deal of this nature, where you have that larger scale, which gives the combined company stronger negotiating power, be it with its suppliers and its vendors. You have the opportunity to merge production facilities and corporate functions like finance and marketing, etc. to reduce costs. Also, this idea kind of reminds me of the Coach and Kate Spade's, operating in a similar space but ultimately diversifying the business with more than one established brand in the portfolio. Here, you would add Hollister and Abercrombie & Fitch to that portfolio for American Eagle. They also have their Todd Snyder and Tailgate stores, very small parts of their business but they're clearly trying to branch out and diversify the different storefronts that they have. It also seems to me like Abercrombie has been a bit more of a significant international presence that can be leveraged for American Eagle further abroad, not only with that Zalora deal that I mentioned earlier, but for a sales revenue breakdown, Abercrombie & Fitch international business was about 36% of total revenue, whereas American Eagle, what I could find, it's about 15% of their company operated stores are international locations, so most likely a smaller footprint. And for Cerberus to be looking at it, from their end, you get two well-known brands that, arguably, this is their business that they can help return to favor with consumers with, potentially, the right rebranding, cost cuts for profitability, and as you mentioned in terms of those deep pockets, Cerberus has about $50 billion or so in assets under management, giving it the pocketbook it needs to really pursue this deal.  But, all in all, in terms of final thoughts for this, considering the bleak outlook that we've mentioned for Abercrombie & Fitch in terms of some of its comparable sales and trends and the headwinds that it faces, I think that even at some of the current depressed trading levels, a lot of investors have to wonder whether the ultimate buyer is getting that good of a deal, whether it's Express or American Eagle or someone else. I think it's understandable that the market has been a little skeptical. American Eagle's stock has been pushed down with these deal rumors. I think a lot of people would also be skeptical to buy into a business that seems increasingly out of touch as you have some of those fast fashion houses stealing market share, and as malls continue to lose foot traffic. Do you take a more bullish view in terms of the overall benefits that these two companies have together? Or do you think you also have a similarly more skeptical view in terms of whether or not this will actually pan out well for both of the entities involved? Sharma: Vince, I have a slight sliver of optimism when I think about this deal. I'm skeptical about the industry. I'm skeptical about the market demand and these high fixed costs that both companies face, if we look at the deal being Abercrombie merging up with American Eagle backed by Cerberus. But, this private equity group is well-resourced, but contrary to what might appear on the surface, the company Cerberus is looking at a number of deals, and they have a great track record of extracting value for shareholders. They don't base the deal coming into it and helping out American Eagle on some projected numbers that the two companies can create together. They look at the deal according to their own internal rate of return, and they usually don't proceed with these types of deals until they think that, with this action plan, we'll work with management, we think we can hit our internal targets and get our value out in the deal. So, it's sort of a strong vote of confidence. That's why I have a slight bit of optimism. They're not going to pull their money into this merger and watch it sit. They will be a very active partner to make sure that value does get extracted, which will benefit current shareholders of both firms. I still think it's going to be an uphill climb, but I have a little bit of this optimistic feeling that value will be created. Shen: Thank you, Asit, for bringing this up, in terms of the internal rate of return that all these private equity funds and firms will have before they look to invest in any deal like this. It's important to note that and, the idea that the vote of confidence that it provides. My last point before we move on to our next potential M&A deal is with American Eagle, for their business overall, something to highlight is that while their comps haven't suffered quite as much as Abercrombie & Fitch, and they're also seeing maybe 1% or single-digit declines in their comps during certain periods, but a big point of growth for them is their Aerie offshoot brand. It will be interesting to watch, if this deal goes through, how they can combine some of their more stable and high-growth brands and business with the struggles that we've seen from the portfolio brands at Abercrombie & Fitch. But, making sure we have enough time to cover our next topic.  We know that Abercrombie is fielding acquisition offers. Our next company, Kraft Heinz, which is the $110 billion food and beverage company, actually appears to be shopping. Back in February, the company put up a massive $143 billion offer to combine with the Europe-based Unilever in what would have been one of the biggest deals in history. That would put major staples like Heinz Ketchup, Kraft Mac & Cheese, Jell-O, Breyers Ice Cream, Lipton tea, and Axe Body Spray all under the same roof. The $50 per share offer presented a 17% premium for Unilever, but the company soundly rejected the deal. And even if the two companies were able to agree on terms, the regulatory scrutiny would have been pretty intense due to their size and their overlapping geographic areas and businesses. But since February, after the Unilever deal fell through, Kraft Heinz have been planning its next move. Asit, before we talk about another deal that could be in the works, could you give us a little bit of background on who runs the show at Kraft Heinz, and why they seem so eager to close another acquisition? Sharma: Sure. Kraft Heinz is really aggressively managed and invested in by 3G Capital. This is a Brazilian investment firm which has its roots, decades ago, in three Brazilian partners, of which Jorge Lemann is probably the most visible and well-known. These investors started with small conglomerates back in Brazil. Listeners will be very familiar with Anheuser-Busch Inbev. The company Inbev was a Brazilian beer company, and through a series of mergers, it's become the largest beer brewer in the world. As our listeners know, the company acquired SABMiller at the end of last year, and now there's nothing left for Anheuser-Busch to do in terms of acquisition, except maybe look outside of the beer industry. This is a good example of how 3G Capital operates. They love to build firms up through mergers, and have a certain playbook that they implement. This playbook is usually isolating a company which is not very well-managed with just mediocre margins. They'll acquire that company and then cut costs dramatically. They did that by reducing headcount, reworking the supply chain, by implementing something called zero-based budgeting, which means that every year, instead of looking at last year's budget, you create it from scratch to see what your costs really are, and execute accordingly.  So, they increased the value of the company, but they're really not that concerned about growing revenues. To me, that's actually a harder thing to do in the business world. It's one thing to find a company that's doesn't operate quite as smoothly as it should and optimize it. But to actually increase sales is a harder task. So, what many investors have noted about 3G Capital is their tendency, after they optimize the cost side of a company, to go in and make another acquisition. It's been a very good vehicle for investment return. Another prominent one of their initiatives was the acquisition of the old Burger King brand, taking that from a private company back to a public company, merging that with Tim Hortons, and slowly trying to take over the quick-service side of the food industry. That, in a nutshell, is how 3G Capital operates. They and longtime partner and financier Warren Buffett love to do deals together. 3G provides the operational aspects and some of the capital, and Uncle Warren lends billions of dollars usually in preferred stock. And it's been a very successful formula. So, here we have Kraft Heinz, which was created by these partners. They are now trying to figure out, we've optimized Kraft Heinz. What else can we acquire? This is where their latest target, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), comes into the picture Shen: Rumors of another 3G-backed deal have been floating around since late last year, when the company began raising funding, about $10 billion worth for a consumer goods company, according to people who were close to the matter. You mentioned Colgate-Palmolive as the new potential candidate. The company, though, at least in relation to Kraft Heinz, has no food or beverage business that would mesh with Kraft, on top of its well-known toothpaste and personal care products, unless you count the dog and cat food business. So, why do you think Colgate-Palmolive is now in the crosshairs for 3G? Sharma: This is not just a great question for the podcast, Vince. This is a great philosophical question. Why on Earth would this company turn its attention to a totally different industry within consumer goods? I think the philosophical answer is that at some point, this particular business model that 3G employs, if you cannot improve revenue, you have to look somewhere, and I think they're out of options. There are only so many giant food conglomerates that are similar to Kraft Heinz that you can purchase. Mondelez International, which is, ironically, the old Kraft company, keeps coming up in conversation. That's a merger which may or may not occur in the future. There just aren't a lot of companies in the multi-billion market cap range that would make it worth their while. So, they have to look outside of their current wheelhouse. Colgate is an interesting option. You can't get deal synergies from complementary products, but you can diversify your revenue. So that's one optimistic way to look at this -- they're broadening out their product face and insulating themselves against possible future declines in their condiment and packaged foods business. Shen: OK, that makes sense to me. I figured the diversifying aspect of it would be a key part of why Colgate-Palmolive is attractive. Another part that comes through is, they were recently rejected in that huge deal offer to Unilever, whereas with Colgate-Palmolive, they have a management team that seems quite happy to consider a sale of its company. I have a note here from CEO Ian Cook, who's reported to have stated his interest in selling the company at about $100 a share. That's a more than 30% premium to current trading levels. Ultimately, with a lot of the bigger names like you mentioned in these sectors, these huge portfolio companies are often dealing with stagnant or declining revenue. 3G Capital actually isn't the only company that's looking at Colgate-Palmolive, since there are reports that the company is considering a big move like selling itself. Unilever and Johnson & Johnson have also been named as potential suitors. To close us out, any final takeaways from you, Asit, in terms of the way that 3G Capital operates, but also what the deal might look like with Kraft Heinz and Colgate-Palmolive? Obviously, details right now are scarce. A lot of this is actually just breaking this morning and in the past day. Any final thoughts or takeaways? Sharma: My final thoughts are, this company, Kraft Heinz, has extremely deep pockets, and they have financing on the side with Warren Buffett whenever they want it. So, they could pay the premium, and pay the $100 that Colgate-Palmolive wants. One not very fun aspect of the deal for Kraft Heinz is that they would like to find companies that have a much lower operating margin than they do and optimize that. Unilever would have been a great deal, because Unilever's operating margins are only around 14%, whereas Kraft Heinz's operating margin is about 23.5%. Looking at Colgate-Palmolive, their operating margin is already 25.5%, so there's not a lot of great work there to do in terms of the cost-cutting we talked about. However, final thought, and I've said this on the show many times, but I'm going to keep repeating it because it's a bit of a hard concept, when you are an acquiring company, you want to look for a target which has a lower enterprise value to EBITDA value to yours. That means the total value of the company divided by its earnings. If that multiple is lower than yours, there's some value creation that can happen afterwards. In this case, Kraft Heinz has a current EV to EBITDA value of just over 19. Colgate's EV to EBITDA is about 16.5. So, there's something in there for this very sharp management team at Kraft Heinz to work with. Like you said, they have the funds, we very well may see this deal go through, and this conglomerate only grow bigger in the near future. Shen: Thanks a lot, Asit. Both of these deals, for Abercrombie and Kraft Heinz, are developing. As we get more details, or if something gets locked down and finalized, we will happily revisit and provide some more input in terms of what the final valuation came out to, and things along those lines.

Abdul Razak Ali Artan also told his parents in the note, reassembled by investigators, that he "will intercede for you in the day of Judgment," according to the investigative case file of the attack obtained through an open records request. "My family stop being moderate muslims," says a transcription of the handwritten note made by investigators and found by Artan's bed in his family's apartment. "Oh! Ummah we are not moderate muslims, we are muslims," the note continues, using the word referring to the Muslim community. Artan also wrote: "In the end, I would like to say that I pledge my allegiance to 'dawla,'" an Arabic word that means state or country and a likely reference to the Islamic State group. "May Allah bless them." He concludes by saying he's leaving his property to his beloved "but yet 'moderate mother.'" Artan's family was mystified by that note, which caused them a great deal of anguish, said Bob Fitrakis, a Columbus attorney representing the family. To this day, the family has no idea why Artan took those actions, he said Thursday. "The family is mystified by what happened. They're absolutely clueless," Fitrakis said. The 18-year-old Artan was shot and killed by an Ohio State officer moments after driving into a crowd on Nov. 28 and then attacking people with a knife. The records show Artan asked to drop all his classes at Ohio State on Nov. 16, saying he had "No regrets whatsoever." In a series of Facebook rants previously reported, Artan nursed grievances against the US. "If you want us Muslims to stop carrying lone wolf attacks, then make peace" with the Islamic State group, he warned in those posts in which he also railed against U.S. intervention in Muslim lands. Artan posted those comments at 9:49 a.m. on Nov. 28, just three minutes before the attack began, according to an unclassified FBI report showing the time line of the attack that was released through the open records request. One of his brothers saw those comments and tried too late to contact him, thinking maybe it was a joke or his account had been hacked, Fitrakis said. That timeline and other FBI records also show that Artan went to Washington, D.C. a few days before the attack where he also made unidentified purchases at a Walmart. The family didn't realize he'd traveled there, has no idea why he went, and urges anyone with information about that trip to contact authorities, Fitrakis said. The day before the attack, Artan left his job at a nearby Home Depot, saying he was tired, a co-worker told investigators. This was unusual, "as he never left early from work," the co-worker said. Artan had told the co-worker several times that fall he was disgruntled with school and wanted to drop out, according to the records. The morning of the attack, Artan bought a set of knives, a tomato and a cucumber at 7:20 a.m. at a Walmart on the west side of Columbus. The "suspect was pleasant and very polite during the checkout process," the Walmart cashier later told investigators. Artan wanted to buy a chicken breast as well but didn't have enough money, the file said. At 7:50 a.m., Artan dropped his sister at a high school near their home on the city's west side. He paid a brother $40 he owed him around 9:30 a.m., when the brother last saw him, according to FBI records. After arriving on campus, Artan drove his brother's Honda Civic over a curb and into a crowd of people and crashed it into a planter. Artan then got out and started slashing at people with an eight-inch knife, records show. In a coincidence, a nearby building had been evacuated because of a reported gas leak. "I'm going to . . . kill you," Artan told one female student, using an expletive, the records show. OSU officer Alan Horujko, on the scene because of the gas leak, saw the crash, then chased Artan as he slashed at people, yelling at Artan to drop the weapon, according to Horujko's account of the attack. Artan eventually stopped and came toward the officer, according to the report. "The suspect was looking directly at me as he charged toward me, but I could see no expression or emotion in his eyes," Horujko said in his account. "I believed the suspect was going to attack me with the knife, and I was in fear for my life." Horujko shot and killed Artan moments later. His actions were cleared by a grand jury. Artan came to the U.S. in 2014 as the child of a refugee. He had been living in Pakistan from 2007 to 2014. Authorities believe Artan's attack was partly inspired by an American-born cleric killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen. Ohio State's student newspaper, The Lantern, ran an interview in August with an Artan in which he criticized the media's portrayal of Muslims and expressed concern about how he would be received on campus. ___ Andrew Welsh-Huggins can be reached on Twitter at https://twitter.com/awhcolumbus.

Lafayette police say a loss prevention officer approached Julie Wright, 35, and another woman about shoplifting last Friday at the Walmart on Commerce Drive. Police say the women fled the store, but they left a 2-year-old child in a stroller behind at the store. Officers started looking through the stroller to identify the child, and that’s when they found a bag of spice inside one of the pockets. Police also found a receipt with the child’s father’s name on it. Police say Wright was babysitting the child at the time, and the child is back home. A warrant was issued for Wright’s arrest on May 27, and she was taken into custody on May 30. She is currently in the Tippecanoe County Jail.

Donovan joined with Vermont power companies, businesses, and residents to launch a new campaign to protect Vermonters from being scammed by people pretending to be a utility. These scammers call residents and businesses demanding immediate payment for electricity with a credit card, pre-paid card or money order. Utilities report these scams are increasing and scammers are becoming more sophisticated and tech savvy in their scams. To raise awareness and protect Vermonters, the Attorney General’s office started the “Scam Buster” campaign, reminding people to stop, ask, and confirm before they make any payment to avoid being scammed. “Protecting Vermonters is the number one focus of our office,” said Vermont Attorney General T.J. Donovan. “Our team is working with local businesses and utilities to raise awareness. If any Vermonter is not sure about who is on the other end of the phone, they should not make a payment and call the AG office or their local utility.” Felicia Charland works at the Holiday Inn in Shelburne and received one of those scam calls. “The tone and tactics of the person on the other end didn’t sound like my local utility. They were pressuring me for immediate payment. I started asking questions and then hung up, called my local power company Green Mountain Power and the attorney general. I am so glad this campaign is raising awareness, helping prevent anyone from losing money to a scammer,” Charland said. Businesses including Walmart and CVS will put up posters and make sure employees are on alert for people who come in needing to buy a pre-paid card to pay a utility bill. “Walmart is happy to assist the Attorney General in creating awareness in order to protect Vermont consumers. We are working to train our associates to notice the warning signs of these scams,” said Jason Klipa, Director of Public Affairs, Walmart. The Vermont Attorney General was joined by representatives from Burlington Electric Department, Washington Electric Co-op, Vermont Electric Co-op and Green Mountain Power. “As we focus every day on delivering exceptional customer care to members of the Burlington community, the new Scam Buster campaign provides another important tool for our effort,” said Andi Higbee, Burlington Electric’s Director of Customer Care. “We must remain vigilant in staying two steps ahead of the misguided people who try to take advantage of our customers. We appreciate the collaboration with the AG’s office and our utility colleagues that led to creating this new program.” “We are pleased to join in this effort to protect hardworking Vermonters from phone scammers and swindlers. We will stand together to fight the bad actors that trick people, many of whom are our most vulnerable Members,” said Sue Bernier, VEC’s Manager of Member Services. “Please verify when money is demanded of you. Hang up and call your local utility to have them check your account before you release funds. Thank you, Attorney General Donovan, for helping to raise awareness about this important issue and for helping to ensure that cheaters don’t win.” “Anyone can fall prey to scams and unfortunately more of these incidents are occurring across Vermont”, said Patty Richards, Washington Electric Coop’s General Manager. Getting the word out and reminding Vermonters to be wary of calls asking for immediate payment are one step to stop thieves. “This is a terrible thing scammers are doing; they not only steal money but they leave the victim feeling violated and embarrassed”. If you receive a call asking for payment from your utility be sure it is really your power company. When in doubt take action, and hang up. You can always place a call directly to your electric utility and verify if you owe money. “This is an important awareness campaign that will protect the customers we serve, and Green Mountain Power is appreciative of the Attorney General leading this effort as we all work together to make sure these scammers don’t succeed,” said Mary Morris who leads the customer care team at Green Mountain Power. “These scammers are using technology, becoming more manipulative, even having numbers that look official as if the call is coming from the utility. This proactive effort will help tremendously, and raise awareness that customers should stop, ask and confirm before they feel pressured to make a payment.” The Attorney General advises Vermonters who may be targets of scamming activity to report it to the Consumer Assistance Program (CAP) at 1-800-649-2424, or go to the CAP website for more information: https://www.uvm.edu/consumer?Page=scams.html Recent Stories ‘Hollywood heroin’ hits Vermont Windsor wants a plan for local prison’s… Quiros battle rages over $2 million in… Opponents of assisted living project drop court… New owners plan upgrades at Magic Mountain… A small town remembers its big literary… Filed Under: Vermont Press Releases Tagged With: power utilities, TJ Donovan, Vermont attorney general VTDigger.org posts press releases as a way of providing readers with information directly from businesses, state agencies, political organizations and nonprofits.

The state police detective unit assigned to his office is investigating reports that in March the three suspects used fraudulent credit cards to steal thousands of dollars worth of merchandise from multiple Walmart locations. According to Gulluni's office, the three are suspected in cases in western and central Massachusetts, Connecticut and possibly Rhode Island. They are believed to have traveled together in a white Ford Expedition Extra Length SUV. The vehicle may have been a rental with plates from Rhode Island or from another state. Gulluni's office released several photos of the three suspects. The photos, taken from surveillance cameras, show two men and a woman. Each appears to be white or Hispanic. One of the men is thin and has short hair and a mustache. The other man is stocky and clean-shaven. Anyone who recognizes any of the suspects is asked to call the Massachusetts State Police Detective Unit at 413-505-5936. Those who wish to remain anonymous may text a tip via a cell phone by addressing a text message to "CRIMES," or "274637," and then beginning the body of the message with the word "SOLVE."  View Comments About Us About MassLive.com Advertise with us Contact Us Frequently Asked Questions Jobs at MassLive.com FAQ Community Rules Subscriptions The Republican Custom news, traffic & weather text alerts Receiving breaking news push alerts R Rewards E-edition Login Email Newsletters Subscriptions & Circulation Contact The Republican Searchable archive MassLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Travel Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Rentals Classifieds Shopping Good Deals Local Businesses Your Regional News Pages Springfield Worcester Boston All Towns Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on MassLive.com Videos Photos Interact with us Weather Post a job Post a free classified ad Sell Your Car Sell/Rent your home Sitemap & search Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2017 MassLive LLC.

Prosecutors accused the seven of obtaining stolen credit information from overseas hackers. They then encoded the stolen credit information onto plastic gift cards, which they took to Walmart stores in various states and bought genuine Walmart gift cards. The genuine gift cards were taken to Sam’s Club stores and used to buy more than $1 million in cigarettes. The conspirators sold off the cigarettes for cash to various black market vendors, according to prosecutors. A grand jury indicted 10 people thought to be involved in the scheme in November 2015. The seven sentenced Wednesday all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering and aggravated identity theft, according to U.S. Attorney John Stuart Bruce. They were sentenced by U.S. District Judge Terrence W. Boyle in Raleigh. The seven are: ▪ Tendai Munyaradzi Makoni, 34, of Durham, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison. ▪ Momar Talla Ndir, 32, of Raleigh; three years and six months. ▪ Dabed Del Jesus Sanchez, 22, of Raleigh, three years and six months. ▪ Joseph Daren Holcomb, 43, of Charlotte, two years and 10 months. ▪ Aaron Kent Davis, 23, of Raleigh, seven years. ▪ Mark Tony Evans, 28, New York, two years and six months. Another Raleigh man, Pa Ambrose Mendy, 31, was convicted in September 2016 and sentenced to two years and six months behind bars on charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering, aggravated identity theft, trafficking in counterfeit access devices and aiding and abetting, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.

Ella CeronJun 1, 2017 9:41AM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog PinterestBloomberg/Getty Images A 16-year-old named Eliza Wasni is in custody and charged with first-degree murder after authorities allege that she attacked her Uber driver early Tuesday morning in Lincolnwood, Illinois, the Chicago Tribune reports. The man has since died from wounds sustained in the attack. According to the Associated Press, Eliza used the ride-hailing app to catch a ride from a Walmart outside Chicago, her third ride of the night into early morning. (According to the Uber app's community guidelines, children must be supervised by a parent or guardian with them. In some cities, teens aged 13 to 17 can use the app with a special account that is linked to a parent's profile. But the Chicago Tribune reported that Uber did not immediately respond to their request for comment regarding how Uber enforces that rule.) Eliza was matched with driver Grant Nelson, who picked her up from the superstore. According to the Associated Press, a description of the attack read at the court hearing on Wednesday said that Eliza was seen walking "nonchalantly" through the store with what are believed to be the knives used to attack Nelson. CBS Chicago reported that surveillance video from Walmart showed she had apparently stolen those weapons. According to prosecutors at the hearing on Wednesday, the alleged attack began after 34-year-old Nelson began the route. Possibly two minutes into the drive, the report alleges that Eliza attacked him from where she sat in the back of the car. He escaped the car after sustaining multiple stab wounds and yelled for help. He later died at the hospital, but not before telling police what had happened to him. Police say they found Eliza nearby. She had reportedly taken the car and driven off and was hiding with a machete and a knife. Police used a taser on Eliza because the police report notes she did not comply when they first asked her to drop the weapons. Authorities also found a blood-covered shirt that matched the one Eliza was wearing on the Walmart footage. She has been charged with first-degree murder as an adult and is being held without bail. According to the Chicago Tribune, after being taken into custody Eliza "declined to make a statement." The Tribune also reports that Nelson's family has asked that those wishing to remember his life to donate to the Anti-Cruelty Society and the Cook County North Suburban chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. In a statement, Uber said, "We are heartbroken by the loss of one of our partners, Grant Nelson. Our deepest sympathies and prayers are with his family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time.” Related: Uber Almost Got Kicked Out of the App Store for This Seriously Shady Move follow us Facebook Twitter Pinterest Recommended for You Follow:FacebookTwitterInstagramPinterestWe Heart ItTumblrYouTubeGoogle Plustoggle social menu Condé Nast Condé Nast Websites Allure Ars Technica Backchannel Bon Appétit Brides Condé Nast Traveler Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ GQ Style Pitchfork Self Style Teen Vogue The New Yorker The Scene Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Site MapContact usNewsletter SignupSubscriptionsIn this issue CareersCondé Nast StoreReprints/PermissionsParsons x TeenVogue Accessibility Help Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy (Revised 1/2/2014).  Teen Vogue may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.  Your California Privacy Rights.

The girl, Eliza Wasni, called for an Uber ride — her third that night — and a driver pulled up in a silver Hyundai Sonata. Wasni climbed into the car. About two minutes later, as the car reached an intersection a few blocks away, she began stabbing and hacking at the driver from the back seat, prosecutors said at a news conference. The bleeding driver, 34-year-old Grant Nelson, managed to pull the car into a nearby condominium building driveway. He ran to the lobby entrance, banged on the door and screamed. “Help me,” Nelson shouted, “Help me, I’m going to die.”© Reuters Meanwhile, Wasni tried to flee by taking the wheel of the car, but soon rammed into a median and took off on foot, prosecutors said. After residents called 911, police arrived to find a bloodstained car, and a trail of blood leading from the parkway around the side of the building. There they found Nelson in the grass in a pool of his own blood, suffering from deep stab wounds and hacking wounds to his arms, side, head and chest. He was coherent enough to describe his assailant to police and what happened, but he would later die in a hospital. Police found Wasni after identifying her from the Uber app on the driver’s phone, which he left in the car. She was crouching behind a building near where she’d abandoned the car, holding a machete in one hand and knife in the other, prosecutors said. She wore only a bra and leggings — a Chicago Cubs shirt was found nearby, the Chicago Tribune reported. When she repeatedly refused to drop her weapons, police used a stun gun on her and took her into custody. They would later find surveillance video from Walmart that prosecutors say shows Wasni stealing the weapons while wearing a Cubs shirt. Authorities charged Wasni as an adult with first-degree murder, the Chicago Tribune reported. A judge called the attack “extremely violent” and ordered her to be held without bail. She will be held in a juvenile facility, the Tribune reported. She appeared in court Wednesday in a white jail jumpsuit, her blond hair disheveled and her eyes kept mostly to the floor. 16-year-old girl charged with murdering her Uber driver with machete https://t.co/SCpfwK6Hh5pic.twitter.com/X8pJLHhKgm — WSVN 7 News (@wsvn) May 31, 2017 Prosecutors called the attack “heinous” and “not provoked in any manner.” Wasni lives with a single mother and is a student at Taft High School in Chicago, her public defender said in court, according to the Chicago Tribune. She was in violation of the company’s 18-and-older age restriction for riders. Access to the service can be removed if a rider is found to be underage. An Uber spokeswoman said in a statement to the Chicago Tribune the company is “heartbroken by the loss of one of our partners, Grant Nelson. Our deepest sympathies and prayers are with his family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time.” The ride-hailing company — embattled from a number of recent internal struggles and controversies — has previously made headlines regarding allegations that its drivers assaulted passengers. But this case involved the opposite. And the shocking incident spurred the question: Why would a teenage girl — seemingly unprovoked — brutally attack a complete stranger? Grant Nelson’s sister, Alex Nelson, said in a news conference Wednesday the details of the attack were “horrifying and saddening,” and that “obviously this is a time of heartbreak and tremendous loss for us.” “Grant was an extraordinary figure in our lives,” she said. “He was a gentle man. He was a good man.” Grant Nelson, who lived with his parents in Wilmette, just north of Chicago, had a wide range of interests — from animals to classical opera to military history. “We don’t have any answers,” Alex Nelson said.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman At 50 Strong, America and Innovation Go Hand-in-Hand by Ashley Thompson, CEO – 50 Strong SOURCE: Walmart DESCRIPTION: There’s a game that my husband, Brendan, and I play every time we go to a trade show. We flip the products over to see where they were made, and usually we see the name of a country overseas, like China or Taiwan. When I ask the sales manager why, I usually get one standard response: “You can’t make this in the U.S.A.” This has always been interesting to me because I know that you can make a lot out of plastics in the U.S. – my family has been doing it every day for the past 35 years! Not only is it possible, it’s work that has provided for us since my father founded Precision Thermoplastic Components, Inc. in 1982. What started out as a fun little game pushed my husband and me to address what we saw as a real need for even more American-made products. In 2012 we started our company 50 Strong in Lima, Ohio, producing U.S.-made water bottles, bottle cages, and tire repair levers for Walmart’s bike accessories department. As the brand grew, we were constantly looking to innovate. I began to spend weeks in the housewares aisles of various stores, watching how people shopped and asking about their water bottle must-haves and pet peeves. Our designers took the responses and created a line of the top 10 bottles that folks were looking for. Innovation is at the heart of what we’re doing at 50 Strong, which means we’re dedicated to making smarter products with better manufacturing processes that we engineer ourselves. When we started the brand, we also started the 50 Strong Foundation, our nonprofit that receives 10% of all sales to fund education for manufacturing workers. It doesn’t matter if these people are going to work for us or some other company; any time we can add skilled workers to the industry is a true benefit for the future of American jobs. Our family is competitive, and we feel great pride being able to say that we’re making a better, smarter product with great quality at a competitive price. Partnering with Walmart is another big source of pride for us because we know that their commitment to U.S. manufacturing is as real as ours is. When a retailer is willing to develop a team to focus on finding more suppliers of U.S.-made products, that’s when you know they truly care. The name “50 Strong” stands for the 50 states, and came from our vision to make America stronger by making more of the products that we use here, in America. For every job that we’re able to fill with an American worker, we know there will be a ripple effect throughout that person’s community. Maybe they’re coaching youth baseball, maybe they’re volunteering at church, or maybe they’re just spending more time helping their kids with homework. The feeling of providing meaningful jobs is hard to put into words, but our mission is simple: When we start making more things in America, it’s a win for our workers, our families, and our communities.

In one hand, she gripped a machete and in the other, a knife. She was wearing a bra and leggings, a blood-splattered Chicago Cubs shirt was lying on the ground nearby. Thats how shocked officers describe the scene in which they found her. Wasni is now charged with first-degree murder in the slaying of Uber driver Grant Nelson, 34, in a Windy City suburb. According to cops, the teen refused to surrender to officers and had to be tasered. Chicagos latest outrage has shocked even hardened cops and residents who have grown immune to the teetering towns daily body count. The details were horrifying and saddening, the dead mans sister, Alexandra told reporters. The loss of intelligence and conversation and nuance and thoughtfulness that he brought into all of our lives is going to be felt  it will reverberate with us  for years. Detectives believe Wasni -- a high school student who lives with her single mother -- was looking for trouble and took at least three Uber rides in the hours before the murder. The teen had earlier nonchalantly walked into a Walmart store, then walked out with a stolen machete, prosecutors say. At 3 a.m. on Tuesday, Nelson -- who made money on the side driving for Uber -- picked up the teen in his silver Hyundai Sonata, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Within minutes, its believed Wasni savagely stabbing Nelson without provocation from the backseat, slashing his arm, side, head, chest and neck. Gravely injured, Nelson staggered into a condo lobby begging: "Help me! Help me! I'm going to die." Shocked residents called cops who found Nelson dying on the grass, a pool of blood building around him. His phone was open to the Uber app -- and his last call. Before he died, Nelson described his killer to cops. Prosecutors say Wasni tried to flee in Nelsons car but crashed less than a block away. And thats where cops found her. She appeared in court wearing in a white jail jumpsuit, her eyes turned down to the floor. Wasni has been charged as an adult. His devastated sister said of Nelson: He was a gentle man.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web The new Iron Age? The future of the mainframe in a digital-everything world By Derek Britton Feature  What advantages can mainframe bring to digital transformation? Shares Warren Buffet’s recent sell-off of IBM stock started another round of discussions about the credentials of ‘Big Blue’. The press cuttings about IBM’s fiscal performance combined with the musings of trade journalists mean that you could be forgiven for thinking this might end badly for the mainframe world. After all, 20 quarters of IBM missing revenue targets coupled with unprecedented choice in the server market is making life very hard for the most venerable of machines.    It’s not how big it is, it’s how you use it  What we do know is that 58% of large organisations, as of this year, still want to fully leverage their mainframe investment. We also know that the overwhelming majority of the world’s biggest banks, insurers and retailers run their business on mainframes, according to IBM.    Any review of a platform, especially one so business critical, needs to fundamentally consider why anyone would need it. And in today’s digital-everything world, one has to assess the changing requirements of IT in the contemporary commercial environment, and the mainframe’s ability to cope with these changes. A better question therefore would be, what’s driving change in the large-scale organisations that possess mainframe computing power today?    Digital transformation  The digital economy is here, and money is being spent – Finextra reported nearly two years ago that $16.6bn being pumped into digital transformation in American banking alone. Meanwhile, European Bank ING has adopted a close collaboration model with technology providers to support its digital transformation programme.  Digital transformation is driving customers to look for ways to maximise their mainframe investment. 67% of organizations in the same BMC survey above are looking to increase capacity on their mainframe to meet their business priorities.  That is to say, they are betting on the mainframe to support transformation.    In one of the keynote sessions at SHARE in March 2017, industry commentator Peter Ruttan of IDC asserted that progressive organisations are integrating and modernising mainframe operations as part of their transformational process. So much so, that they aspire to having “a connected mainframe” that sits at the heart of a digital organisation, not apart from it.    Brands including Target, Walmart and Capital One have talked about their own internal transformation programmes. Mainframe technology remains central to how they conduct business. Indeed, Wal-Mart spoke at the mainframe SHARE event in 2016 about its transformation programme.    Flexible foundations  IDC’s Ruttan further commented, “workload should run where it should to best support the business”. In a business-first mantra, technology serves the strategy, not sets it. Workload management offers that flexibility. IBM themselves stated that 93% of the top mainframe clients were also now running Linux.  IDC talked about half the clients they spoke to seeing a lower cost of ownership on the mainframe as a result of looking at workload changes. New workload choices around Cloud, Linux, Web, Mobile and Java integration, were all shaping how the mainframe was being seen as a source of new revenue, rather than a necessary cost to support it.    Reports suggest that there continues to be a significant uptick in the number of deployments on to Linux servers worldwide. In one article from late 2016, we were told that “nearly 50 percent of z Systems clients are using Linux”. Indeed, BMC reported that statistic as over 50%. We also know that Linux overtook other UNIX systems in terms of market share as far back as 2013, according to the Linux Foundation.    IBM cites a variety of clients running Linux on IBM z Systems across banking, manufacturing, government and telco sectors.  Elsewhere, software experts Astadia have helped a major European banking client who decided to move a huge workload on to the IBM z series mainframe. Consolidating older server environments as part of a major modernisation programme, the organisation moved a core trading system on to their preferred strategic platform.  Accelerated delivery  A flexible approach is one thing but the results need to be instantaneous. Understandably, DevOps and how it can be employed across the entire enterprise estate, has become a mainstream mainframe topic. Gartner has previously stated that by the end of 2016 DevOps would be at around 50% adoption globally. Forrester went as far as to publish a white paper entitled, rather bluntly, “Digital Transformation Needs Mainframe DevOps”.  Many in the industry, alongside traditional mainframe vendors, have taken great strides to dispel as a myth the idea of bi-modal IT. Compuware, CA, IBM and Micro Focus among others all talk of contemporary tool-chains that enable DevOps-style deliver for mainframe teams. The 2016 State of DevOps Report asserted, “[Developers using DevOps] spend 22 percent less time on unplanned work and rework, and are able to spend 29 percent more time on new work”. What is undeniable is the level of interest in DevOps as a holistic, enterprise-scale approach, including the mainframe environment.    Speaking at a DevOps conference in London, ING Bank global CIO Ron van Kemenade says investment in new skills and a transition to DevOps is critical to its “Think Forward” digital strategy. “We wanted to establish a culture and environment where building, testing and releasing software can happen rapidly, frequently and more reliably. When beginning this journey we started with what matters most: people,” putting the focus on engineering talent and creating multi-disciplinary teams, where software developers partner with operations and business staff, has led to more automated processes, a sharp reduction of handovers and a “collaborative performance culture”.  Speaking at the same event, Jonathan Smart, head of development services at Barclays, talked up an eighteen-month push by the bank to incorporate agile processes across the enterprise. The amount of “strategic spend” going into agile practices and processes rose from four percent to more than 50%, says Smart, and the company now has over 800 teams involved.  Meanwhile Antonio Bravo, BBVA’s Head of Strategy & Planning, explained the main goal of the bank’s recent adoption of agile practices is “to increase the speed and quality of execution” of their transformation programme.  New horizons: monitoring mainframe movement  Arcati, IBM, CA, BMC and others continue to survey and report on the market, with an overwhelming response of a committed community dedicated to a future of mainframe programming. A sample of recent surveys shows 90% or more in each case viewing the mainframe environment as strategic. Moreover, a closer look at the IBM revenues suggest that z systems revenue has largely held firm amid the recent disappointing corporate results. The examples above also serve well in demonstrating how large-scale organisations are looking to grasp the nettle of how the mainframe sits in the middle of their digital transformation initiatives.  It’s little wonder we are hearing whispers from sources close to IBM of a likely announcement of a new mainframe offering in the near future: Big iron’s new iron. The hundreds who attend the SHARE events twice-yearly will doubtless be out in force to see what new advances the mainframe can bring to the digital transformation table in the coming months. What looks certain is that the activities surrounding how the mainframe best supports the business will continue for years to come.  Derek Britton, director, strategy and enablement at Micro Focus Image Credit: Skeeze / Pixabay Topics Web software enterprise networks mainframe ibm warren buffet digital transformation idc devops GET YOUR FREE MAGAZINE NET: The Money Issue worth £5.99 Join over 7000 ITProPortal subscribers!

(Reuters) A 16-year-old girl was carrying a machete in one hand, a knife in the other, as she walked out of a Walmart store in the Chicago suburb of Lincolnwood without paying at about 3 a.m. Tuesday, prosecutors said at a court hearing. The girl, Eliza Wasni, called for an Uber ride — her third that night — and a driver pulled up in a silver Hyundai Sonata. Wasni climbed into the car. About two minutes later, as the car reached an intersection a few blocks away, she began stabbing and hacking at the driver from the back seat, prosecutors said at a news conference. Teen girl charged in killing of Uber driver randomly attacked man with knife, machete she'd just stolen: authorities https://t.co/aElJubW9zo pic.twitter.com/B7FVRWefG1 — Chicago Tribune (@chicagotribune) June 1, 2017 The bleeding driver, 34-year-old Grant Nelson, managed to pull the car into a nearby condominium building driveway. He ran to the lobby entrance, banged on the door and screamed. “Help me,” Nelson shouted, “Help me, I’m going to die.” Meanwhile, Wasni tried to flee by taking the wheel of the car, but soon rammed into a median and took off on foot, prosecutors said. After residents called 911, police arrived to find a bloodstained car, and a trail of blood leading from the parkway around the side of the building. There they found Nelson in the grass in a pool of his own blood, suffering from deep stab wounds and hacking wounds to his arms, side, head and chest. He was coherent enough to describe his assailant to police and what happened, but he would later die in a hospital. Police found Wasni after identifying her from the Uber app on the driver’s phone, which he left in the car. She was crouching behind a building near where she’d abandoned the car, holding a machete in one hand and knife in the other, prosecutors said. She wore only a bra and leggings — a Chicago Cubs shirt was found nearby, the Chicago Tribune reported. When she repeatedly refused to drop her weapons, police said they used a stun gun on her and took her into custody. They would later find surveillance video from Walmart that prosecutors say shows Wasni stealing the weapons while wearing a Cubs shirt. Authorities charged Wasni as an adult with first-degree murder, the Chicago Tribune reported. A judge called the attack “extremely violent” and ordered her to be held without bail. She will be held in a juvenile facility, the Tribune reported. She appeared in court Wednesday in a white jail jumpsuit, her blond hair disheveled and her eyes kept mostly to the floor. 16-year-old girl charged with murdering her Uber driver with machete https://t.co/SCpfwK6Hh5 pic.twitter.com/X8pJLHhKgm — WSVN 7 News (@wsvn) May 31, 2017 Prosecutors called the attack “heinous” and “not provoked in any manner.” Wasni lives with a single mother and is a student at Taft High School in Chicago, her public defender said in court, according to the Chicago Tribune. She was in violation of the company’s 18-and-older age restriction for riders. Access to the service can be removed if a rider is found to be underage. An Uber spokeswoman said in a statement to the Chicago Tribune the company is “heartbroken by the loss of one of our partners, Grant Nelson. Our deepest sympathies and prayers are with his family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time.” The ride-hailing company — embattled from a number of recent internal struggles and controversies — has previously made headlines regarding allegations that its drivers assaulted passengers. But this case involved the opposite. And the shocking incident spurred the question: Why would a teenage girl — seemingly unprovoked — brutally attack a complete stranger? [From #deleteUber to ‘Hell’: A short history of Uber’s recent struggles] Grant Nelson’s sister, Alex Nelson, said in a news conference Wednesday the details of the attack were “horrifying and saddening,” and that “obviously this is a time of heartbreak and tremendous loss for us.” “Grant was an extraordinary figure in our lives,” she said. “He was a gentle man. He was a good man.” Grant Nelson, who lived with his parents in Wilmette, just north of Chicago, had a wide range of interests — from animals to classical opera to military history. “We don’t have any answers,” Alex Nelson said.

Julia Michaels performs Wednesday during the Wal-Mart U.S. employees meeting. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has introduced virtual reality as a teaching tool for employees who are participating in the company's training program, tapping into the technology in efforts to better prepare its workforce for the sales floor. The retailer showed off the program during a tour of its Fayetteville training academy Wednesday, which was part of Wal-Mart's shareholders week in Northwest Arkansas. The program Wal-Mart is utilizing was produced by STRIVR, a company that specializes in virtual-reality programs designed specifically as tools for learning and development. Its customers range from professional sports teams to Fortune 500 companies, according to the STRIVR website. Tom Ward, vice president of central operations for Wal-Mart U.S., said virtual reality is being used by the academies to simulate scenarios like the holiday rush, accidents or spills. "There might be certain things that you don't want to re-create [in a store] every day like a spill hazard or accident," Ward said. "Maybe there's a scenario around service where we want to show somebody exactly how to do something or how not to do it. We don't want to disrupt the business in the store to constantly re-create that same scenario." Wal-Mart demonstrated the educational benefits by showing a busy holiday-shopping scenario that was filmed in one of the company's stores. A volunteer wore the virtual-reality headset and was immersed in a hectic scene, which featured crowded aisles lined with customers and employees who were trying to direct traffic. The scene was visible to others in the classroom on two television screens on each side of the room. [EMAIL UPDATES: Get free breaking news alerts, daily newsletters with top headlines delivered to your inbox] A Wal-Mart spokesman said the program has been tested in about 30 training academies and will be rolled out to each location. Wal-Mart has about 155 training academies but plans to push the number to 200 by the end of the year. "Imagine being a new assistant manager having never worked in a Wal-Mart before," Ward said before the demonstration. "How on earth do you prepare somebody for the holiday peak season, that rush of a busy store and all of the action going around you? With this we can really prepare these leaders." Incorporating virtual reality into a training program for managers and assistant managers is just one of many steps the retailer has taken to better train its 1.5 million U.S. workers. In addition to investing $2.7 billion into employee wages, the retailer has invested in workforce initiatives. Executives believe that the efforts have played a significant role in Wal-Mart's ability to continue to attract customers and drive sales in its 4,700 U.S. stores. Wal-Mart reported same-store sales increased 1.4 percent during the first quarter of its fiscal year, the 11th-straight quarter of improvement. Traffic also increased 1.5 percent, which was the 10th-straight quarterly gain, during a time in which other brick-and-mortar retailers were experiencing declining results because of the rise of online shopping. Other tools outlined by the company Wednesday included the introduction of updated hand-held devices, which employees use to view a number of in-house apps that help manage inventory, locate products and see a store's real-time performance scores based on Wal-Mart's clean, fast and friendly criteria. The company has introduced software aimed at improving scheduling for employees as well, allowing part-time workers to add shifts more easily than before. Chris Norton, a longtime employee and a department manager at the Fayetteville store, said the efforts Wal-Mart has put into recent initiatives aimed at its employees is an improvement from the past. "It got derailed a little bit," Norton said. "They kind of forgot us, but we're on the right path now." Judith McKenna, chief operating officer for Wal-Mart's domestic stores, applauded workers for their performance during the company's meeting for U.S. employees at Bud Walton Arena earlier Wednesday. The morning pep rally featured actor Terry Crews and a performance by Julia Michaels. During her address to the crowd, McKenna credited employees with playing an important role in being "part of a company that is taking it to the competition." McKenna also said she believed that Wal-Mart's training academies have become a "game changer." The first academies opened in Fort Smith, Fayetteville and Carrollton, Texas, in early 2016. Courses last between two and six weeks, depending on the focus. Wal-Mart said it will train 250,000 employees in its academies this year. "We are still learning," McKenna said later during a question-and-answer session with the media. "I think we're on the right track in terms of how long some of our programs are. As we get into this, we might decide assistant manager training is eight weeks or five weeks or whatever that looks like. We are listening every step of the way." McKenna and U.S. Chief Executive Officer Greg Foran acknowledged the increasing role automation and technology is playing in retail. The executives also believe that Wal-Mart has an advantage in the changing retail landscape because of its workers. "Wal-Mart employs a lot of people," Foran told employees during the U.S. meeting. "We also serve a lot of people. The connections we make, the relationships you will build, they generate the spark that is at the core of the Wal-Mart experience. "But it takes work. If we get it wrong and the service is bad, then it can be a real downer. The experience won't be good for anyone. If you get it right, it's an enormous advantage."

Established companies had a hard time understanding why this model is a thing of the past. What it all comes down to is: that customers have become market-savvy forward-thinkers. Startups are entering the game and are giving customers what they want. They are disrupting the industry and forcing incumbents to catch up or fall behind. WATConsult CEO Rajiv Dingra said, “It's very important to know what disruption is -- it's not an event, it is a process, and digital creates a lot of disruption -- in many ways, like pricing and promotion.” Talking about disruptive pricing, Project X founder Nicholas Russel said, "If we think about pricing contextually, disruptive pricing is jumping in the real world and starts acting like pricing online. The main concern is about cost price and value. Considering Apple as a brand, the cost of making is $211 and the price we get it from the market is around $550, which helps in reaching the margin to $399, i.e 60%. Comparing Amazon with Walmart, the former pays 1/3rd of what Walmart pays for its retail stores.” Amazon retail online EB/EBITA ratio is 26.41. Talking about what e-commerce (Amazon) can do which retail can’t, he said, “E-commerce can have discounted price as compared to retail stores. And, it may lower the price for the good conditioned used products.” "Bitcoin is going to be the biggest disrupting things in the future which is not controlled by anyone, it is the market altogether. In future, it is possible that you won’t see the price tag on products -- it will be available after you scan the barcode on the product," Russel said. Dingra added, “Amazon is not an e-commerce company -- it has now become an ecosystem company." Lava business head & CMO Sunil Raina said, “Disrupting only happens through technological advancements. The challenges faced by Lava to be one of the best and trusted brands in industry are rapid tech changes, short product life cycle, transparent product, demonstration-based selling, different marketing, one brand mutiple channels, multiple pricing and the ever-evolving customer. To acheive the goal, Lava and XOLO have busted many myths in the industry and the business model of Lava and XOLO are single-layer distribution followed by cash & carry. Keeping the quality in mind it stands on two pillars -- first, the consistent product quality, and second, consistent great service. “For us, quality is not a trade-off for price,” Raina said. Lava claimed to have the highest reach of 1,65,000 retailers with $2 billion annual global revenue. About competition, Rana added, “We are building our base for the last seven years, and after an year, we will be prepared to take on Vivo and Oppo.” SapientRazorfish VP Saurabh Das said, “Service is basically -- live up to your brand promise wherever and whenever customers come calling. A brand needs to accelerate innovation in the service experience to create greater value for customers -- stay differentiated & monetise.” tags ZeeMeltNicholas RusselWatConsultRajiv DingraProject XSunil RainaLava business Trending ZeeMelt: OTTs add to momentum of FB & Youtube video consumption Involve MIB in transponder allocation to DTH, says House panel Blockbuster shows come to an enthralling end on Star World Ex-Infosys executive Shashi Shekar Vempati appointed as Prasar Bharati CEO Sonam to showcase Kalyan's Ziah collection   Latest Reads mCube: Star, Zee, Filmfare, NDTV, WATConsult, AdLift & Patanjali win awards AdLift, a global digital marketing agency with offices in the US and India, has won two gold awards at Master of Modern Marketing Awards and Conference at New Delhi.

He didn't deserve this fate." GettyTribune Broadcasting - Anna Burkart By Associated Press Jun 1, 2017 A 16-year-old girl walked out of a suburban Chicago Walmart holding a machete and knife she'd stolen, climbed into an Uber car and began hacking at the driver, prosecutors said at a hearing on Wednesday. The driver died of his wounds Tuesday after giving police a description of the attacker that led to her arrest. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below A prosecutor read in court a description of the attack that said Eliza Wasni simply climbed into a car driven by 34-year-old Grant Nelson, and stabbed him and hacked him to death early Tuesday morning. The judge ordered the girl, who was charged as an adult with first-degree murder, held without bond. The 2-page description offers no reason for the attack, but portrays Wasni as a calm girl who "nonchalantly" could be seen walking through Walmart, the knives in hand, before she walked outside without paying. Prosecutors said that Nelson, a resident of Wilmette, picked the girl up shortly after 3 a.m. Tuesday in Lincolnwood. It was her third ride in an Uber vehicle in the early morning hours of Tuesday. Two minutes after he began driving, prosecutors said that Wasni began stabbing Nelson from the back seat. Nelson was able to pull over and ran into a nearby condominium building, where he screamed, "Help me, help me! I'm going to die!" until residents called 911. Wasni climbed into the front seat of Nelson's blood-splattered silver sedan and drove away, striking a median in the road. She jumped out of the vehicle and fled on foot. When Lincolnwood police arrived, they found the vehicle with blood on both the inside and the outside, with Nelson's phone open to the Uber app. The app said that Nelson's passenger was someone named Eliza. Officers followed the trial of blood and found Nelson lying in grass. He was bleeding profusely from several wounds, and was able to tell the officers what had happened. He died at a nearby hospital a few hours later. Using the description given by Nelson, police found her nearby crouching behind an air conditioner — a machete in one hand and a knife in the other. Police warned her that she would be shot with a Taser if she did not drop the weapons, and when she did not comply an officer used the Taser. Wasni dropped the knives and was taken into custody. Police said she did not make a statement. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below According to prosecutors, police recovered a shirt the girl could be seen wearing in the Walmart. The shirt had blood on it. Uber officials said the company was working with police to provide information relevant to the investigation. "We are heartbroken by the loss of one of our partners," Uber said in a statement. "Our deepest sympathies and prayers are with his family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time." Nelson's sister, Alex Nelson, told WMAQ-TV in Chicago that her brother was a good person. "He was not a vindictive person," Alex Nelson said. "He was not a cruel person. He didn't deserve this fate." It is the first homicide in Lincolnwood since 2006, police said.

Some associates said they were surprised to see so many opportunities offered to them during their trip. Stacey Martinez is an associate from Arizona. She said the one thing that stuck out to her was the kindness shown by everyone at the event. During a bus ride Wednesday afternoon, Martinez said she saw groups of people from various countries laughing and simply having some fun. “It’s just cool seeing people laughing with each other even though they don’t understand what each other are saying," Martinez said. "It’s just nice to see that when there is so much going on in the world and on this level it’s like we’re just human and everybody is just kind to one another and it’s just great.” Lucas Freitas is an associate from Mexico and said this is not the first time he has been to America. This is the first time though that he attended Walmart's shareholders event. He said he has been to similar events with other companies, but this one is very different. One of the big differences he said was the people and how open they are to others. He attributed this to the spirit of Northwest Arkansas. “How people are engaged," Freitas said. "How people are trying to get in touch with you, people from other countries, from other cultures. They are willing to understand what you do. They are willing to connect. That kind of stuff is very cool.” The events will last until Friday (June 2) and then the associates will return to their stores. Martinez said she was excited to take what she learned and share it with her coworkers.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS A 16-year-old girl walked out of a suburban Chicago Walmart holding a machete and knife she'd stolen, climbed into an Uber car and began hacking at the driver, prosecutors said at a hearing on Wednesday. The driver died of his wounds Tuesday after giving police a description of the attacker that led to her arrest. A prosecutor read in court a description of the attack that said Eliza Wasni simply climbed into a car driven by 34-year-old Grant Nelson, and stabbed him and hacked him to death early Tuesday morning. The judge ordered the girl, who was charged as an adult with first-degree murder, held without bond. The 2-page description offers no reason for the attack, but portrays Wasni as a calm girl who "nonchalantly" could be seen walking through Walmart, the knives in hand, before she walked outside without paying. Prosecutors said that Nelson, a resident of Wilmette, picked the girl up shortly after 3 a.m. Tuesday in Lincolnwood. It was her third ride in an Uber vehicle in the early morning hours of Tuesday. Two minutes after he began driving, prosecutors said that Wasni began stabbing Nelson from the back seat. Nelson was able to pull over and ran into a nearby condominium building, where he screamed, "Help me, help me! I'm going to die!" until residents called 911. Wasni climbed into the front seat of Nelson's blood-splattered silver sedan and drove away, striking a median in the road. She jumped out of the vehicle and fled on foot. When Lincolnwood police arrived, they found the vehiclewith blood on both the inside and the outside, with Nelson's phone open to the Uber app. The app said that Nelson's passenger was someone named Eliza. Officers followed the trial of blood and found Nelson lying in grass. He was bleeding profusely from several wounds, and was able to tell the officers what had happened. He died at a nearby hospital a few hours later. Using the description given by Nelson, police found her nearby crouching behind an air conditioner — a machete in one hand and a knife in the other. Police warned her that she would be shot with a Taser if she did not drop the weapons, and when she did not comply an officer used the Taser. Wasni dropped the knives and was taken into custody. Police said she did not make a statement. According to prosecutors, police recovered a shirt the girl could be seen wearing in the Walmart. The shirt had blood on it. Uber officials said the company was working with police to provide information relevant to the investigation. "We are heartbroken by the loss of one of our partners," Uber said in a statement. "Our deepest sympathies and prayers are with his family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time." Nelson's sister, Alex Nelson, told WMAQ-TV in Chicago that her brother was a good person. "He was not a vindictive person," Alex Nelson said. "He was not a cruel person. He didn't deserve this fate." It is the first homicide in Lincolnwood since 2006, police said.

Local food pantries fight to feed as many hungry families as they can throughout the summer, despite their limited supply. "More families are in need and food insecurity is greater because a lot of those family rely on free and reduced breakfast and lunch or the snack pack program," Life Source director Jimmie Conduff said. Partnerships like Razorback Food Recovery help keep the pantries open. Truck loads of unused hot food from the Walmart shareholders meeting were dropped off at the pantry and donated to families. "Usually later in the week if there's things from the different locations they'll donate. But, those things usually come on Friday and that typically helps us get through the summer," Conduff said. He said the pantry will feed 4,000 to 5,000 thousand people this summer.

The Benefits are Starting to Accrue! One analyst sees good things coming from Wal-Mart's digital efforts. By Ben Levisohn Updated May 31, 2017 2:40 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large If anyone doubted Wal-Mart Stores' (WMT) commitment to online--and making itself into a legitimate competitor to Amazon.com (AMZN)--those doubts should have faded when the big box retailer bought Jet.com last year. Wal-Mart has spent billions to expand its distribution centers, upgrade its technology, and offer more products to its customers. Illustration: Getty Images Now, says Baird's Peter Benedict and team, the benefits from Wal-Mart's online investment are "starting to accrue." They explain: While an ongoing process, these efforts have positioned WMT to compete more effectively in today's increasingly omni-channel retail world. Encouraging signs of traction include early success with online grocery pickup (in ~670 stores, ~1,100 by year end), the recent acceleration in walmart.com's online assortment (50M+ SKUs today vs. 8M in 2015), and the increasingly positive impact ecommerce is having on Walmart-U.S. comps (~80bps in 1Q17). With Walmart-U.S. ecommerce sales/GMV rising 63%/69% y/y in 1Q17, the top-line payoff is starting to accrue, although segment profitability remains under pressure for now. Benedict and team are looking ahead to Friday's annual shareholders meeting for more details on Wal-Marts plans. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores have advanced 0.2% to $78.30 at 2:24 p.m. today, while Amazon.com has declined 0.6% to $990.93.

Photo / Facebook A 16-year-old girl was charged today as an adult with first-degree murder and accused of stabbing her Uber driver to death in suburban Chicago. Eliza Wasni allegedly stole a knife and machete from a Walmart in Skokie, asked for a ride using the Uber app and within minutes started attacking her driver, the Daily Mail reports. The driver, Grant Nelson, managed to stop his car and run into a condominium building lobby where he sought help but later died of his wounds. Wasni allegedly drove off in Nelson's car, struck a median and then ran off. She was apprehended moments later after removing a bloody shirt. Lincolnwood police said they responded to a report of a man screaming for help at about 3.20am Tuesday when they found Nelson, 34, of Wilmette with multiple stab wounds. Nelson told them he was a driver for the ride-sharing service Uber and that his passenger stabbed him, police said. He was dropping off the girl when the attack occurred, police said. Officers located Wasni - who lives with her single mother - behind a building near the crime scene in possession of two weapons they believe she used in the stabbing, Lincolnwood police said. They said she declined to make a statement. Uber states that customers must be 18 years or older to use the service. It's unclear how that is enforced. It's also unclear what prompted the attack. Nelson died at a nearby hospital a few hours later. Chicago-area TV stations reported that Nelson's blood-splattered silver sedan remained in the intersection as police investigated his killing.

The car then exits the parking lot back out onto the main road where Nelson was attacked. Nelson was rushed to hospital where he later died. Photo / ABC7 Wasni was ordered held without bond at her first hearing Wednesday afternoon in Skokie court. Uber officials said the company was working with police to provide information relevant to the investigation. "We are heartbroken by the loss of one of our partners,' Uber said in a statement. 'Our deepest sympathies and prayers are with his family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time." Nelson lived with his parents and worked as a waiter, while driving for Uber and Lyft after his shifts. He had reportedly finished Memorial Day dinner with his family on Monday when he decided to go out and earn some extra cash by driving. Nelson's sister, Alex Nelson, told WMAQ-TV in Chicago that her brother was a good person. "He was not a vindictive person," Alex Nelson said. "He was not a cruel person. He didn't deserve this fate." Alex said that her brother was a pianist who loved classical music, films and the family dog Lilly. "You know, I think Grant was the kind of man who never knew his true life's calling," she told CBS Chicago. "Unfortunately, now he never will get to find that." "If he had been given the chance to live, he would have continued to fill the world with good thoughts, good music, and intelligent conversation. We will all miss that without him here," she added. Nelson is pictured on the far left with members of his family. Photo / Facebook Mike Foley, a friend who worked with Nelson in the restaurant industry, said he would sometimes speak about the dangers of ride-sharing. "I remember him mentioning that he once had to stop and get gas in a really sketchy neighbourhood. He might not have really thought anything of it," Foley told ABC 7. Colleen Milner, another former coworker, said that Nelson was the last person who would be in a deadly confrontation. "It's pretty heartbreaking to hear that. That guy is super nice. One of the nicest guys you'll know. Quiet, shy, but he wouldn't do anything to anybody," Milner said. A service has been planned for Friday at Chicago's Jewish Funerals in Skokie. The family has asked that donations be made to the National Alliance on Mental Illness's Cook County North Suburban chapter and the nNti-Cruelty Society. It is the first homicide in Lincolnwood since 2006, police said. - Daily Mail Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Discover more Loading Loading Herald Services Book your ad Driven Photos for sale True Commercial Death Notices Public Notices Our Regional News Stories The Northern Advocate Thrilling Lions match lights up city Fans on both sides of the match were unified in their enjoyment of the match.
