The retailer says it will reduce shipping time to two days on 2 million of its most popular items including essentials like diapers and pet food as well as hot toys and electronics. Wal-Mart's average shipping time has been three to five days. Starting Tuesday, it's also reducing the spending necessary for free shipping to $35 from $50. Wal-Mart's ShippingPass, launched as a pilot program in the summer of 2015, was aimed at challenging Amazon Prime and had allowed members to buy more than a million items for free shipping at Walmart.com. Last year, it trimmed its shipping time to two days from three, and cut the annual fee by a dollar to $49. Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart said it worked well, but the company concluded shoppers shouldn't have to pay a membership fee for free shipping. The strategy shift is one of the first big moves by Walmart.com's CEO Mark Lore, who joined the company when Wal-Mart bought online retailer Jet.com last year. And it's an illustration of how Wal-Mart is trying to figure out a way to compete with Amazon and its dominant Prime plan. But some analysts say the approach may not be sufficiently aggressive to compete with Amazon Prime. They believe Wal-Mart — which also has encouraged shoppers to collect their online orders from stores to avoid shipping costs — should get rid of any minimum required for free shipping. "They should eliminate the threshold altogether, said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics LLC. "I know it's a difficult pill to swallow. But if you look at how things are going, click-and-pick is never going to be as popular as click-and-ship." Amazon's membership program costs $99 a year, but includes services like streaming music and video that have created fierce loyalty. Analysts say Amazon Prime members buy more frequently and spend more money. Amazon doesn't disclose a Prime subscriber total, but it's estimated to be around 65 million. Wal-Mart wouldn't say how many ShippingPass subscribers it had, but all will receive a refund of their membership fee. Lore declined to comment on Amazon, but said lower prices, a wider assortment of eligible goods and faster shipping alone can build loyalty. Lore promised more moves ahead to spur Wal-Mart's online business. "Two-day, free shipping is table stakes," he said in a conference call Monday. "We've upped the ante. On a very fundamental level, we don't have to charge for membership. We can save customers both time and money." Lore said he believes the new approach will dramatically increase sales. Wal-Mart's online sales had been slowing over the past two years, but notably accelerated during last year's third quarter. Wal-Mart reports fourth-quarter results next month. Wal-Mart said purchases outside the 2 million most popular items will count toward free shipping, but won't get the faster delivery. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Answer Is Simple – Customers By Nihat Arkan — November 30, 2016 In a year of many major acquisitions, one of the most interesting has been that of Jet.com by Walmart. Jet emerged on the scene just two years ago and quickly earned a spot as a recognized ecommerce player. With a business model built on innovative dynamic pricing, Jet’s success largely came from the company’s low-cost initiatives. Enter Walmart. Although the retailer has also made a name for itself with low prices, that’s where the similarities between Walmart and Jet end. The companies may have played the same game, but each employed a strikingly different business model. Is integration possible? Or did Walmart acquire Jet for a different reason? It’s likely that Walmart was motivated to partner with Jet in order to gain access to a whole new set of consumers. There’s no denying that Walmart owns the brick-and-mortar space. Most people in the U.S. live within 15 minutes of a Walmart, and the average Walmart Supercenter retails 140,000 items. That said, Walmart has struggled to bridge the digital gap and constantly loses customers to major ecommerce players like Amazon. According to recent research, the average Walmart shopper is a 50-year old female living  in a household with an annual income of $53,125. This is great for in-store shopping, but it misses the mark in today's dropship model of commerce when it comes to engaging digital consumers, many of whom are turning to smartphones and computers to make smaller purchases more often. Walmart has been very transparent about its intention of attracting urban, millennial shoppers via Jet. In the race against Amazon (let’s be honest, everyone is racing Amazon these days), it makes more sense for big-box retailers like Walmart to acquire companies that have mature ecommerce capabilities rather than overcoming decades of highly entrenched brick-and-mortar operations and processes. Bringing on another company instead of reinventing its entire digital business model allows Walmart to gain market share online while still maintaining the upper hand for in-store sales. Full integration with Jet’s dynamic pricing model will place many new demands on Walmart’s unparalleled supply chain operations. This will add major complexities to its product information management systems, warehouses and shipping logistics systems -- namely, Walmart will need a stronger digital content strategy to handle omnichannel sales across a larger, more diverse consumer pool. Likewise, product information will need to be more robust and accurate in order to supplement the tactile touch points brands and retailers lose when going from selling in store to online. While a strategic ecommerce business model like this is likely a goal for Wal-Mart long term, its acquisition of Jet is a smart move in the interim. And, really, there’s little rush for Walmart to integrate with Jet. Today, Wal-Mart’s top priority should be leveraging Jet to reach new customers and establish strong relationship with them online. This leaves ample room for both retailers to pursue differentiated business models and reach a wider pool of consumers. For now at least, the biggest strength of Walmart’s acquisition of Jet may not be coming together, but rather staying separate.

How Did Javi React? TV 0 0 0 February 6, 2017 ‘Teen Mom’ Star Kailyn Lowry Caught With Another Man! How Did Javi React? Perry Carpenter Kailyn Lowry’s drama with Javi Marroquin heated up on the latest episode of Teen Mom 2. Things got super awkward when Marroquin unexpectedly walked in on Lowry leaving her house with another man! Lowry refused to comment on camera, but he has since opened up about the incident. In an interview with Radar Online, a source close to Lowry explained how she tried to avoid the situation altogether. Unfortunately, Marroquin arrived early to pick up the kids and threw Lowry’s plans out the window. “Kail was home trying to leave to go to Walmart,” an insider shared. “They had an agreement that at 5:00 he was to come pick up his stuff by himself and drop Lincoln off. It was 4:00 when she was trying to leave. That was within minutes of Kail telling Javi she was leaving for Walmart.” Lowry also violated the agreement by bringing Peach and Darius with him to the house. The estranged couple had previously agreed that only Marroquin was allowed in the home. Although Lowry was with another man, the source claims that nothing romantic was happening. “The guy in the episode has been Kail’s friend for years, Javi acted like he walked in on something romantic between those two, but he didn’t,” the source explained. “They’ve been friends for a few years and tried to see their potential romantically. They are still together.” At the time of the incident, Lowry refused to comment. According to the Stir, Lowry didn’t discuss the matter because she was tired of talking about their split on the show. love my boys so much ❤️❤️ A photo posted by Kailyn Lowry (@kaillowry) on Feb 5, 2017 at 10:43am PST “There’s so much that was left out. But throwing him under the bus doesn’t solve anything,” the insider added. “I’m going to bite the bullet on this one. The truth will eventually reveal itself.” Of course, none of that stopped Marroquin from airing his grievances on Teen Mom 2. Although the cameras didn’t capture the fight, Marroquin revealed what happened behind closed doors. “I texted her and said can I drop Lincoln off and she was like, ‘I’m at Walmart right now come in an hour,'” he stated. “We pull up earlier since Kail’s car was there and we see another car. I knock on the door, Lincoln goes in and I said, ‘Let me get my stuff’ and she won’t let me in. I’m like I’m not leaving my son with another dude here, not happening.” Marroquin continued, “How disrespectful are you? You’re going to disrespect me and chill with some dude? I came home, I didn’t even go to my own house, I came to a hotel. I don’t know what’s going on in her head.” @evamarcille is killing it tonight. She makes me look better ???????? everyone check out @firstaveeyewear A photo posted by Javi Marroquin (@javim9) on Jan 12, 2017 at 7:01pm PST Sadly, the couple’s 7-year-old-son took the brunt of the fight. The Hollywood Gossip reports that Isaac expressed his frustrations with Lowry’s ex, Jo Rivera, after her fight with Marroquin. “Mom and Javi were fighting. I wasn’t okay,” Isaac told his father. “It’s not fair because do you know what my mom is doing? My mom is saying I can’t come with Javi to see his new house and he can bring Lincoln. It’s not fair.” Radar Online reports that Rivera assured Isaac that he would talk to Lowry about the situation. “I’m going to speak to your mom,” he said. “She’s a little upset. A lot of things are happening right now and it’s stressful and confusing. They might fight every now and then, but everything is going to work out and be okay.” While Lowry deals with all the drama with Marroquin, In Touch Weekly reports that she is currently gearing up for a special interview with Teen Mom 2 producers, titled “100 Things.” Lowry is expected to open up about her split with Marroquin, but it isn’t clear how much she is prepared to reveal. New episodes of Teen Mom 2 air Monday nights on MTV.

Police arrested Sebastian Erazo, 49, and Raul Rivera, 57, on Friday at 4 p.m. after an investigation. According to a police report filed in Framingham District Court, Walmart’s asset protection manager called police on Jan. 24 to report the thefts. Both men worked as cashiers in the store. The two men would take turns ringing each other in, but instead of ringing the items in, they would void the item and they’d leave without paying. Items stolen by the two men included tablets, Playstation game systems, controllers and a sofa cushion, police wrote in the report. Between Nov. 25 and Jan. 13, the pair stole nearly $1,400 worth of items, police wrote. “It is possible they had started prior to Nov. 25,” police wrote. Walmart security is still reviewing video and receipts to see if the two men had been conducting the scam prior to Nov. 25, police wrote. Police charged both Erazo, of 48B Beaver Park Road, and Rivera, of 10 Greenview St., with larceny of more than $250 by a single scheme and conspiracy to commit a crime. At the two men’s Framingham District Court arraignments on Monday, Judge Jennifer Stark released them without bail. They are both due back in court next month for pretrial conferences.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 February 2017 by Military News Wal-Mart Tried to Take on Amazon Prime and Failed Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) doesn’t think it makes sense to charge its online customers for two-day shipping anymore. The retailer is shutting down its year-and-a-half old ShippingPass program, a $50-per-year two-day shipping service similar to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime. “In today’s world of e-commerce, two-day free shipping is table stakes,” Marc Lore, head of Wal-Mart U.S. e-commerce wrote in an announcement. Wal-Mart is trying to spin the move as a positive, but it’s simply masking the fact that it tried to take on Amazon Prime and failed. Prime is one of the three pillars of Amazon, and its membership drives astounding loyalty. Wal-Mart was looking for a similar effect with ShippingPass. Instead, it’s moving down market, reducing the threshold for free shipping to $35 from $49, and promising to get some 2 million items to customers in just a couple days. Wal-Mart can’t compete Both Amazon and Wal-Mart boast huge marketplaces that bring together thousands of merchants on their online platforms. But where Wal-Mart falls short is that it’s heavily reliant on its third-party merchants to fulfill online orders themselves. In fact, just 2 million items qualify for two-day shipping. By comparison, Amazon’s marketplace has over 50 million Prime-eligible items. That’s thanks to its Fulfilled by Amazon service where merchants send inventory to Amazon’s warehouses, and Amazon handles shipping individual items to customers. In other words, Wal-Mart’s two-day shipping service was half-baked compared to Amazon’s. Customers who signed up for the free trial were likely disappointed at the lack of product selection, and didn’t pay up for the service. Wal-Mart won’t tear customers away from Prime By offering free two-day shipping to everyone, Wal-Mart isn’t trying to get Prime members to ditch Amazon (at least it shouldn’t be). Instead, its strategy seems to be to prevent customers from ever signing up for it in the first place. Prime members are extremely loyal and have an extremely low churn rate , so that’s about the best Wal-Mart can hope for. It’s a bit late to the game, however, considering Amazon has already signed up around half of the households in the U.S. In the last year alone, Amazon added “tens of millions” of new members. If Wal-Mart stands any chance of competing with Amazon, it needs to leverage its physical stores . That’s exactly what its new shipping program does. Items qualifying for two-day shipping are usually available in local stores already, meaning Wal-Mart only needs to ship it the last mile to a shoppers home. While free two-day shipping for everyone may win Wal-Mart a few one-off purchases, it won’t cut into the loyal and growing Amazon Prime customer base. The best it can hope for is to establish its online portals as top of mind for online shoppers. That’s one of the biggest hurdles for Wal-Mart or any online retailer to overcome. Amazon currently dominates mindshare. Fifty-five percent of online product searches start on its website, according to a survey from BloomReach last Fall. If Wal-Mart’s new shipping policy can help it grab some of those product searches, it ought to be considered a win even if its attempt to take on Amazon Prime failed. 10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart Stores When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Kylar Barnes, 18, and Yolanda Jensen, 31, both of Idaho Falls, were taken into custody and booked into the Madison County Jail on several charges. Barnes, Jensen and another woman were inside Walmart around 9 p.m. when they filled up two shopping carts, Rexburg Police Capt. Randy Lewis says. Barnes was leaving the store when Walmart security approached him. “He had around $350 of stuff in his cart, and Yolanda was right behind him with another shopping cart full of stuff,” Lewis tells EastIdahoNews.com. “When she saw security approach Kylar, she took off with her friend and left the cart sitting there.” Detectives learned Barnes had a magnetic device that deactivated store security tags, according to Lewis. Officers tracked down Jensen at her home and learned she had previously been removed from Walmart. Lewis says they also discovered stolen alcohol and other items. Jensen also had a warrant for her arrest out of Bonneville County. Police say Barnes and Jensen visited Albertsons twice during that same day and stole a variety of items, including alcohol. Barnes was arrested on two felony burglary charges, a felony criminal conspiracy charge and a misdemeanor possession of burglarious instrument charge. Jensen was arrested on a felony burglary charge, a felony criminal conspiracy charge and several misdemeanor charges. Barnes and Jensen were scheduled for their first court appearance Monday.

"Following" : "Follow"}} February 06, 2017 10:14am   Comments Share: This article was originally published by DriveWealth. This week, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) e-commerce chief Marc Lore announced, “it no longer makes sense for Wal-Mart to charge for two-day shipping” and that America’s largest retailer will soon be ending its “ShippingPass” delivery subscription plan in favor of a new plan. Okay, sure. No big deal, right? Until we realize that Wal-Mart’s ShippingPass plan was just announced last June. In essence, whatever “made sense” 7 months ago (when ShippingPass was announced) doesn’t make sense now. Seems like a pretty quick change now, doesn’t it? Can you guess why Wal-Mart would go back on its initiative so quickly? If not, don’t worry – we’ll explain. If we had titled this article “Wal-Mart vs. Amazon: The Battle Continues,” you may have had a much better idea. The real culprit here is not that Wal-Mart’s shipping plan “doesn’t make sense” for Wal-Mart anymore, but that Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) shipping plan – Amazon Prime, you may have heard of it – is working way better. What do we know from this, then? If it “doesn’t make sense” for Amazon these days, it may not make sense for Wal-Mart either – competition is fierce. Why? Let’s dig deeper. You may have heard by now – or at least gathered this from the beginning of this article – that there’s a long-standing battle for the future of global retail sales, with both Wal-Mart and Amazon at the head of it. And, if you think about it, while both companies have extremely different business models, they are indeed working towards the same goal. Wal-Mart, which made its great rise to the head of the American retail industry after its opening in 1962, has been most successful and is best known for its giant, all-inclusive retail stores. On the other hand, Amazon, which began in 1994, is of a different age – the age of digital retail. In other words, Amazon is known best for selling a huge variety of products – including retail items, groceries, eBooks, video streaming subscriptions and basically anything you could ever need – online. While both of these retailers are known for their low prices and amazing product variety, the avenue used to obtain their products is largely what sets the two corporations apart. But, that avenue isn’t the most important factor here – the market is. Wal-Mart and Amazon have grown over time, they have begun providing virtually the same products at very comparable prices and are therefore starting to compete in the same markets. As these two retail giants gradually merge into the same market, so begins the race to become the one all-encompassing retail chain of the future. In this race, we’re starting to see a lot of copycatting going on lately. And it’s starting to confuse us all. So, when Wal-Mart announced this week that it would be terminating its ShippingPass program for something that drastically undercuts Amazon’s shipping plan, we were a little confused, maybe, but not surprised. ShippingPass was a service that, for the past 7 months, had been Wal-Mart’s retaliation to the already-very-popular Amazon Prime. For a monthly subscription fee – similar to that of Amazon’s $99/year subscription plan – Wal-Mart had offered its users free two-day shipping among other benefits. But, as Wal-Mart realized it couldn’t stack up to Amazon Prime’s existing popularity or delivery speed, Wal-Mart has given up on the subscription model. Instead, the retailer will now simply be providing free two-day shipping on 2 million items. Free! If that isn’t the biggest challenge to Amazon’s $99/year subscription plan (whose most significant benefit for many users is fast shipping), let us know what is. We’ll wait. In other words, the battle for the shared market continues. Could this be a sign that Wal-Mart is really fueling up to take on Amazon Prime – and, thus, Amazon’s most significant market share – this time? Or a sign that Wal-Mart is simply realizing the power of Amazon and taking a loss on its subscription-based income, just to create even slight competition in Amazon’s online market? We’re not quite sure, but investors’ reactions to the announcement signified the latter, as Wal-Mart stock sunk later into the week. However, it will definitely be interesting to see how this battle plays out and how investors continue to react. As investors yourselves, you might consider looking into Wal-Mart’s new online shipping plan as well as reading its reviews. Keeping current with major business developments could definitely provide insight into the future of the company, and into Amazon’s future, too.

The unidentified man was attempting to load the stolen items into a vehicle with three other suspects around 8 a.m. Saturday, sheriff's office spokesman Capt. Angelo Nieves said. A Walmart employee attempted to stop them and then a customer "assisted" the employee, Nieves said. During the "commotion," the customer shot one suspect multiple times. "What we have at this point is that the individual felt threatened -- one of the suspects reached for something [and he] thought that it was a weapon or firearm," Nieves told the Orlando Sentinel. "The individual who was assisting the [employee] was armed and used that weapon to fire on the suspect." The suspects fled in a red vehicle, which was found to have been stolen in a Jan. 14 carjacking. The car then smashed into two parked cars in the Walmart parking lot, and suspects ran from the scene. By the time deputies arrived, the three suspects were gone. The injured suspect ran into a gas station. Orange County Fire Rescue medics then took the man to Orlando Regional Medical Center for treatment but he died. The customer who shot the suspect was not named and the sheriff's office will decide whether charges are warranted. According to FBI statistics in 2015, 268 of 9,616 criminal gun homicides were deemed justifiable by private citizens. FBI defines a justifiable homicide as "the killing of a felon, during the commission of a felony, by a private citizen." Another 60 cases of justifiable homicides involved weapons other than guns, including knives.

The deadly incident reportedly took place in the parking lot of the Pine Hills Walmart, and the armed bystander was a Walmart shopper who told investigators that he was in fear for his life when the shooting occurred. Wal-Mart customer fatally shoots suspected diaper thief – https://t.co/6eg9B0442M #winknews pic.twitter.com/6IIv1F4Cm7 — WINK News (@winknews) February 5, 2017 As Fox News reports, responding officers didn’t get the call that a shoplifting incident had allegedly taken place at the Walmart location until the alleged diaper thief had already been shot. According to WREG 3, witnesses to the so-called “diaper heist” claim that four individuals walked out of the Florida Walmart with “shopping cart-fulls” of baby diapers and “other items” that hadn’t been paid for. They then attempted to load the stolen items into a red vehicle. A Walmart employee reportedly followed the four people, including the alleged diaper thief who ultimately lost his life in the incident, to their getaway car. The Walmart employee is said to have confronted the group about the stolen property; it was then that the armed bystander came to the employee’s aid. An altercation between the alleged diaper thieves, the Walmart employee, and the armed bystander reportedly ensued as the Walmart employee and bystander confronted each other. At some point, according to the bystander, he feared for his life. He claimed that one of the alleged shoplifters reached for something that the armed bystander thought could have been a weapon. So, according to witnesses, the alleged Walmart diaper thief was shot in the parking lot. “What we have at this point is that the individual felt threatened — one of the suspects reached for something [and he] thought that it was a weapon or firearm. The individual who was assisting the [employee] was armed and used that weapon to fire on the suspect.” After the shooting, the four suspects managed to get into their vehicle and attempted to flee the scene, reports the Orlando Sentinel. Orange County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Angelo Nieves told the media that the suspected diaper thieves didn’t make it far. Rather, they wrecked their getaway vehicle into two other parked cars in the Walmart parking lot and fled on foot. Shooter should be arrested. I suspect he was reaching for a receipt.

It had reportedly been carjacked last month. Three of the suspects in the Walmart theft incident reportedly got away and remain unidentified; the fourth suspect, who was shot in the incident, made it only as far as a gas station across the road. There, the alleged Walmart diaper thief reportedly sought help for his injuries, which witnesses claim that he knew were going to be fatal. “He was saying he was going to die and stuff and I sat down there and held his hand and said you’re going to be okay.” Emergency services were called from the Citgo gas station, and the alleged Walmart diaper thief was transported to a local hospital. He reportedly died at Orlando Regional Medical Center as a result of the wounds he sustained in the shooting.

Local law enforcement officers have confirmed that the dead teen was one of four shoplifters who stolen diapers from the Walmart location. According to witnesses to the alleged diaper theft gone wrong and subsequent shooting, the armed bystander fired five shots during the incident. Police confirm that the armed bystander admitted his role in the death of the Walmart diaper thief who was shot and confirm that the shooters is fully cooperating with investigators at this time; it is unclear whether the shooter may face criminal charges.

Published February 01, 2017 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print  (Reuters) Walmart has been selling its own line of "craft" beers since 2016. Since the six-and 12-can variety packs debuted, the discount retailer has been scaling the alcoholic offering and the beers are now available in 3,000 stores across 45 states. But should brews like Walmart’s “Cat’s Away IPA,” “After Party Pale Ale” and “Pack of Trouble” really be considered “craft?” According to the Brewers Association, an American craft brewer is defined as a “small, independent and traditional.” 5 THINGS YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT MILLER LITE How small is "small?" The Association says to be considered craft, a brewer must have an annual production of six million barrels of beer or less. To be “independent,” fewer than 25 percent of the brewery should be owned or controlled by “an alcoholic beverage industry member that is not itself a craft brewer.” And “traditional” means that the brewer’s product is mostly derived from “traditional or innovative brewing ingredients and their fermentation.” So, does Walmart, which opereates over 11,000 stores around the globe, qualify? According to a new Washington Post analysis, it’s debatable. The chain collaborates with a company called “Trouble Brewing” to brew its signature beers. But, according to the Post, "Trouble Brewing" doesn't really exist. Instead, the applicant listed on the filings with the Treasury Department’s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) is “Winery Exchange, Inc.” That company has since turned into WX Brands. WX Brands “develops exclusive brands of wine, beer and spirits for retailers around the world,” according to its website. But under the “brewery address” section of the TTB filings, Genesee Brewing’s business office in Rochester, N.Y. is listed instead. Genesee is owned by another company that brews Costa Rican lager amid other industrial brands-- i.e. they produce well over the prescribed amount that would be considered "small." FOR THE LATEST FOOD  FEATURES FOLLOW FOX LIFESTYLE ON FACEBOOK  Though the name "Walmart" doesn't appear anywhere on its beer cans, Walmart insists they aren’t trying to trick customers. “We were intentional about designing a package that conveyed a look and feel you’d expect of craft beer,” Teresa Budd, a senior buyer for Walmart’s adult beverage team, told The Post. Whether or not it passes your definition of craft, Walmart's beer has a leg up on its competition when it comes to price.  The beer retails for $7.96 for a six-pack and $13.86 for the variety pack with 12 beers.

The unidentified man was attempting to load the stolen items into a vehicle with three other suspects around 8 a.m. Saturday, sheriff's office spokesman Capt. Angelo Nieves said. A Walmart employee attempted to stop them and then a customer "assisted" the employee, Nieves said. During the "commotion," the customer shot one suspect multiple times. "What we have at this point is that the individual felt threatened -- one of the suspects reached for something [and he] thought that it was a weapon or firearm," Nieves told the Orlando Sentinel. "The individual who was assisting the [employee] was armed and used that weapon to fire on the suspect." The suspects fled in a red vehicle, which was found to have been stolen in a Jan. 14 carjacking. The car then smashed into two parked cars in the Walmart parking lot, and suspects ran from the scene. By the time deputies arrived, the three suspects were gone. The injured suspect ran into a gas station. Orange County Fire Rescue medics then took the man to Orlando Regional Medical Center for treatment but he died. The customer who shot the suspect was not named and the sheriff's office will decide whether charges are warranted. According to FBI statistics in 2015, 268 of 9,616 criminal gun homicides were deemed justifiable by private citizens. FBI defines a justifiable homicide as "the killing of a felon, during the commission of a felony, by a private citizen." Another 60 cases of justifiable homicides involved weapons other than guns, including knives.

News Customer shoots, kills diaper-theft suspect at Pine Hills Wal-Mart Customer of Pine Hills Wal-Mart shot suspected shoplifter A customer of a Pine Hills Wal-Mart shot a man suspected of stealing diapers and other items from the store Saturday morning, according to the Orange County A customer of a Pine Hills Wal-Mart shot a man suspected of stealing diapers and other items from the store Saturday morning, according to the Orange County Caitlin DoornbosContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy A customer of a Pine Hills Wal-Mart shot and killed a 19-year-old man suspected of stealing diapers and other items from the store Saturday morning, according to the Orange County Sheriff’s Office. Sheriff’s Office spokesman Capt. Angelo Nieves said man left the store at 5559 Clarcona Ocoee Road with three other theft suspects and was attempting to load stolen items into a vehicle just after 8 a.m. when a Wal-Mart employee attempted to stop them. That’s when another Wal-Mart customer came out in front of the store and “assisted” the employee, Nieves said. A “commotion” ensued, and the customer — fearing for his life — shot one of the suspects multiple times. One of the suspects reached for something, [and the shooter] thought that it was a weapon. — Orange County Sheriff's Office Capt. Angelo Nieves       “What we have at this point is that the individual felt threatened — one of the suspects reached for something [and he] thought that it was a weapon or firearm,” Nieves said. “The individual who was assisting the [employee] was armed and used that weapon to fire on the suspect.” The suspects got into their red vehicle, which would later be discovered to have been stolen in a January carjacking, and tried to flee the scene. The car then smashed into two parked cars in the Wal-Mart parking lot, so the suspects bailed out and ran from the scene on foot. Deputies were called to the store at about 8:12 a.m. for a report of a “911 emergency,” according to the Sheriff’s Office’s online list of calls for service. By the time they arrived, the suspects were out of sight. The Citgo on Clarcona Ocoee Road where the shot suspect was caught.

(Caitlin Doornbos/Orlando Sentinel) The man who was shot ran to a Citgo gas station across the street from the Wal-Mart, where an ambulance was called. Orange County Fire Rescue medics then took the man to Orlando Regional Medical Center for treatment as a trauma patient. Nieves said the man later died at the hospital. A deputy was checking with surrounding stores including a Speedway gas station next to the Wal-Mart for surveillance footage that may have shown which direction the suspects fled.

(Caitlin Doornbos/Orlando Sentinel) Diapers and other evidence remained scattered across the parking lot as detectives worked the crime scene, Nieves said. Few cars remained in the lot as deputies foraged the area. Yellow crime scene tape stretched around the Wal-Mart and a Citgo gas station across the street as of about noon Saturday, banning potential customers from entering businesses' parking lots. Clarcona Ocoee Road remained open to traffic. Orange County Sheriff's deputies investigate near the scene of the shooting.

Deputies will determine whether charges are warranted for the shooter. No identification was released on any of the individuals involved.  Nieves said there were no other victims. cdoornbos@orlandosentinel.com or 407-650-6931 Caption Officer disciplined after mistaking doughnut glaze for meth Cpl.

Reward offered for information on 3rd suspect in Walmart theft that led to fatal shooting Updated: Feb 6, 2017 - 6:26 PM Twtter A $5,000 reward is being offered for information on the third person involved in a diaper theft that led to a fatal shooting of another suspect at an Orange County Walmart store.  Deputies said a Walmart customer opened fire on Saturday morning on shoplifters who were stealing diapers from the store in the 5500 block of Clarcona Ocoee Road.  Related Headlines State attorney to decide if man who shot Walmart theft suspect will face charges WATCH: Scene from the Walmart shooting Investigators said 19-year-old Arthur Adams was hit multiple times and died at the hospital. The gunman told investigators he fired because he thought one of the shoplifters was reaching for a weapon. The alleged shooter was identified as a 50-year-old black male, and deputies said it will be up to the state attorney’s office as to whether he will face charges. The man was not a member of law enforcement. Deputies have not said if he was legally able to carry a weapon.   .@OrangeCoSheriffs says @Walmart shooter is 50yo black male. They know, but won't release if he was legally able to carry his weapon @wftv pic.twitter.com/vKTWgNFpEz — Cierra Putman WFTV (@CPutman_WFTV) February 6, 2017   Deputies said he was stepping in to help a Walmart employee who was confronting the suspects outside the store.  A second victim, only identified as a juvenile female, was hit in the leg, deputies said. The Orange County Sheriff's Office learned about the girl hours after the shooting when she went to the hospital for treatment. She is considered a witness in the case, deputies said. A third person believed to have participated in the attempted shoplifting is still on the loose, deputies said. It's the second shooting in a Pine Hills Walmart parking lot in under a month. We talk with concerned customers on @WFTV at noon. pic.twitter.com/PN0QKXchQ6 — Lauren Seabrook (@LSeabrookWFTV) February 4, 2017 Witness Renee Kirmani told Channel 9 she saw the three individuals pushing carts filled with diapers and other baby items to a car in the parking lot as a Walmart employee chased after them. "I see them surrounding the car (and) the boys throwing stuff in," she said. "(The employee) was like, 'Don't get in the car.'" Kirmani said she was too busy taking cover to see the shooting take place. "That I didn't see," she said. "I heard shots and then we just ducked down, because we didn't know where the shots were going." Orange County Sheriff's Office spokesman Capt. Angelo Nieves said the suspects got into the maroon Nissan Rogue and fled the scene. The Nissan was reported stolen during a carjacking on Jan. 13, deputies said.  Deputies said the driver of the Nissan hit two vehicles in the parking lot, causing one of the cars to spin, and everyone in the vehicle fled.  The suspect who was shot was found at a nearby Citgo gas station and was taken to the hospital where he died, authorities said. Deputies said the investigation is ongoing and the witness who opened fire is cooperating with the investigation. Workers at the Citgo told Channel 9 the injured suspect walked in and fell to the floor. They said they could tell he was shot multiple times in the leg and stomach. Deputies said Adams is a known gang member and had been arrested 15 times. He was convicted of four felonies.  His friend, Naynay Porter, said Adams was a good person and should not have died that way. “No mother should have to bury their kid,” she said. “He’s done some things in his past he (isn’t) proud of, but he didn’t have to die how he died.”  Deputies are interviewing witnesses and going through surveillance video to see if the suspects were armed. Channel 9 contacted Walmart to learn about the company’s loss prevention policy, but the company declined to comment. Statement from Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings: "The Orange County Sheriff's Office detectives have been working with Walmart representatives and interviewing witnesses to determine the facts in the weekend shooting at the Wal-Mart store. The investigation is ongoing and we ask the community not to rush to judgement.  The case will be presented to the State Attorney for review and appropriate charges will be determined for all involved. The use of deadly force will be evaluated based on law and the right to protect one's self or others from great bodily harm or death."  © 2017 Cox Media Group.

Ordinary merchandise of the past, often seen as inferior or beset by health and safety concerns, no longer rule the roost. Consumers are moving into more esoteric shopping, with online shopping and imported goods at the forefront. Snack foods, personal care products and cosmetics are among the fastest growing purchasing segments, according to Kantar Worldpanel. Directly imported merchandise comprises 30 percent of purchases at Walmart’s membership-only Sam’s Club, with growth in areas such as imported fruit, premium dried foods and liquor. Walmart, which launched its Lunar New Year sales in early January, saw brisk sales of traditional Chinese delicatessen foods, premium wines and chocolates. Marybeth Hays, chief merchandising, marketing and supply chain officer at Walmart China, said the company sources products from 28 countries and has been stepping up collaboration with local suppliers. “Taking my two-year old son to the supermarket would have been such a tedious task during the busy Spring Festival period, so online shopping was a blessing,” Shanghai resident Miriam Yuan said of her pre-holiday purchases. She ordered traditional Chinese foods for elderly relatives in her hometown of Beijing and had the gifts sent there by courier. Consumers born after the 1980s made up 77 percent of online shoppers who placed orders on Alibaba’s Taobao in the run-up to the Lunar New Year. Some 200 select local specialties foods on Taobao attracted buyers in 365 Chinese cities during the holiday shopping period. Alibaba’s Tmall said its imported goods unit, Tmall Global, doubled the number of categories of goods on its platform to more than 3,700 in 2016. The majority of new Tmall Global shoppers last year came from lower-tier cities, with almost a third from third- and fourth-tier cities in China. That compared with about 24 percent in the existing customer base. “For consumers, buying items directly from their countries of origin assures them that they are getting genuine items, often associated with a particular heritage and craftsmanship,” said Daphne Kasriel-Alexander, consumer trends consultant at market research firm Euronomitor International. This new trend of wanting to see where products originate prompted Taobao to initiate live-streaming broadcasts in late December, allowing shoppers to get a close-up look at the farms producing food for sale. Senior researcher Mo Daiqing at China E-commerce Research Center said digital shopping added a new dimension to the traditional Lunar New Year holiday. “Various promotions through online channels especially local specialty products, also provided a retrospective on traditions that might otherwise have seemed distant to the modern digital generation,” she noted. Foreign consumer companies have also been quick to market their products under a premium mantle. French company L’Oreal last year upgraded dozens of boutique shops in China to offer beauty advisors and storefronts featuring skin and hair care products. L’Oreal Group China Chief Executive Officer Stephane Rinderknech told a media briefing last month that the company will continue to expand its product portfolio according to consumer demand. Last year, the company introduced the Roger & Gallet perfume brand and personal care brand Ultra Doux. Currently, 23 L’Oreal brands are available in the China market. “We believe there’s huge growth potential in the beauty business in China, thanks to the nation’s massive middle class and the rising affluence of more than 200 cities,” Rinderknech said. L’Oreal China e-commerce sales jumped 10-fold in the past five years, and China became the second largest global market for the company in 2015. Korean brands are also favorites of young Asian consumers. Beauty brand Too Cool for School invested US$6 million for a 60 percent stake in a joint venture with Shanghai Too Cool Cosmetics. The venture will market South Korean cosmetics in China. “Brands will have to offer consumers more than just convenience,” said Delon Wang, trends manager for the Asia-Pacific at Mintel. “They will also have to emphasize their ethnic and cultural authenticity.” Consumers are no longer just interested in hunting for bargains online. They also want easier payment systems and faster delivery. They want to try new things from around the world, and they want assurances that paying more means higher quality. At JD.com, sales of items costing a minimum 50,000 yuan (US$7,249) tripled last year, while luxury items attracted more buyers from lower-tier cities than from big metropolises like Shanghai and Beijing. Ahead of Spring Festival, JD.com reported that wine, dried fruits and nuts, and fresh food were the top selling products. Home appliances such as cleaning machines and air purifiers were also among the big sellers. Fresh food sales climbed fourfold, while imported fresh food surged 14-fold, especially among consumers aged 26 to 35.

It’s one of the first big moves by Walmart.com’s CEO Mark Lore, whose company Jet.com Wal-Mart bought last year, as it hopes to answer Amazon’s powerful Prime membership success. Wal-Mart says it will reduce shipping time to two days on 2 million of its most popular essentials like diapers, pet food and cleaning supplies. Its average shipping time has been three to five days. Starting Tuesday morning, it’s also reducing the spending necessary for free shipping to $35 from $50. That’s still lagging Amazon.com, which offers two-day delivery on millions of products for Prime members who pay $99 annually and get several other perks.

MEXICO CITY — Mexico could slap “mirror” tariffs against U.S. fabric and apparel imports if U.S. President Trump imposes a 20 percent or other duty on Mexican imports, something textile executives say would severely harm cross-border manufacturers and retailers alike. “It would be a good idea if the government did something to compensate against this [the Trump tariff],” said Sixto Mercado, vice president of top trade lobby Canaive’s branch in Jalisco State, home to Guadajara. “We have many apparel exporters here who would be affected.” His comments come as Mexico is set to begin negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement by May to meet Trump’s calls for a rewrite. That said, economy minister Ildefonso Guajardo said in mid-January that if Trump imposes a tariff or a border adjustment tax, Mexico would pursue “mirror actions.” The statement is an indication of the growing tensions between the two neighboring countries, longtime allies, as Trump pursues his plan to build a wall along the border and claims that Mexico will pay for it. The 20 percent tariff or other duty proposal forms part of the plan to fund the wall. A Facebook post showing an empty Walmart store in Mexico.  Courtesy The U.S. ships roughly $6.5 billion worth of apparel and textiles to Mexico — $4 billion is fabric and $1.2 billion apparel parts, according to Canaive. Conversely, Mexico sends back $4.5 billion worth of clothing and textiles — $3.5 billion of apparel and $1 billion of textiles. A possible trade war has strained diplomatic relations and unleashed a nationalist uproar in Mexico with populist groups calling for consumers to boycott American companies including Wal-Mart, Starbucks and McDonalds. Social media is abuzz with tweets-for-tats urging citizens buy Mexican goods with hashtags such as #AdiosWalmart, allegedly hitting sales at the U.S. discounter’s largest international division.  One tweet showed a Wal-Mart hypermarket in Tepeyac, Guadalajara as empty during peak sale hours on payday. The tweet claimed the store is the retailer’s largest selling in Latin America. A Wal-Mart spokesman said the firm is “monitoring the situation” but had no further comment. If the proposed 20 percent tariff is levied (among other options) to pay for Trump’s border wall and Mexico hits back, “we could grow below zero,” Mercado said, adding that exports could plunge 10 percent, despite a record-low peso. In 2016, the textiles and apparel sector grew 5 percent as strong local apparel sales offset a 4.3 percent drop in U.S. sales. As Mexico flirts with a possible recession, Mixto said local sales could this year grow 7 percent compared to 10 percent in 2016. Amid strong anti-American sentiment, he said local-brand turnover could eclipse U.S. brands for the first time in recent memory. “We have never seen such strong nationalism in Mexico,” Mercado said. “Everyone is being urged to buy Mexican products. This will hit American brand sales.” Many consumers could shun Wal-Mart in lieu of Mexican archrival Coppel or choose to buy at department-store chain Liverpool’s lower-end unit Fabricas de Francia. Mexican fashion designers, long in the shadows, could win consumer hearts. This is bad news for the likes of the Axo or El Palacio de Hierro network, which have grown by bringing aspirational U.S. brands such as ck Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Abercrombie & Fitch south of the border.  An executive at Axo said the 20-brand franchisor has not seen “any sales declines” from the patriotic upsurge and is operating “business-as-usual.” It’s clear Axo and rival Sordo Madaleno, a top architecture firm making a leap into foreign fashion licensing (it just opened Mexico’s first AllSaints outlet) will suffer as consumers tighten their belts and seek “Made in Mexico.” To meet the challenges, Mexican apparel producers are seeking new markets in Central America and Europe with which Mexico has a largely vague free-trade agreement. “Costa Rica, Panama and Central America could be good markets to compete on price and quality but not Argentina and Brazil, because they have very strong industries and brands,” Mercado said. In Europe, Mexican fashion jean labels Oggi and Siete Leguas could make successful forays because they have high-quality products using innovative fabrics and new washing technologies, according to Mercado. “These companies sell premium jeans to Levi’s, Wrangler and True Religion so they could also start selling in Europe.” That will require even more innovation, training and other investment the industry has been slow to pursue. “We need to make more fashion and design and to diversify our exports because we are too dependent on the U.S.,” said Alfonso Zepeda, the man behind Expo Denim, a denim trade fair set to open in Guadjalajara in late May, adding that European expansion should be a priority. “Europe represents a huge opportunity with our low peso,” he said. “There are niches we could exploit. Here in Jalisco we make great coats, cotton knits, denim pants and suits. We could sell these to smaller, H&M-like stores.” Manuel de la O, sales director at sewing machine maker Casa Diaz, echoed views that U.S. consumers would pay for any Trump tariff and that American brands will have a hard time replacing Mexican suppliers, at least right away. “They could send their orders to Vietnam or China and save the 20 percent but then the fleet costs would be 5 percent and the investment and costs associated with the geographical shift could bring that to 13 percent,” said de la O. “If you add to that a 3 to 4 percent [possible] mirror tariff from Mexico, would you sacrifice quality for such a small margin gain?” You're missing something!

(WOFL FOX 35) - Orange County deputies say a man accused of shoplifting from a Walmart has died after being shot by a customer who stepped in to help. Deputies say the 19-year-old suspect died at the hospital after being found a Citgo gas station with gunshot wounds. The shooting happened outside the Walmart Neighborhood Market on Clarcona Ocoee Road. Deputies say the the 19-year-old suspect and three other people were stealing baby items from the store. Deputies say after the suspects ran out of the store with the merchandise, employees followed and a confrontation happened by a car in the parking lot. Investigators say the car the four people were in was reported stolen after a carjacking on January 14. Deputies say a customer came to help the employees, but when the customer felt threatened, investigators say the shopper fired a gun that belonged to him and shot the 19-year-old suspect. Investigators say the suspects then drove off and crashed into two cars in the parking lot before bailing out and running off. The man that was shot ended up at a gas station across the street and later died. Right now, deputies are looking for the other three suspects.

Angelo Nieves, of the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, said an incident started near the vehicle and a witness in the parking lot stepped in to help the employee. “They were fleeing from the store when they were confronted by store personnel,” Nieves said. “Some type of commotion occurred at the vehicle as it was being loaded with the stolen merchandise.”  The witness told deputies it appeared that one of the suspects went to grab something, and the witness, who has not been identified, felt threatened. The witness was armed and opened fire, hitting one of the suspects multiple times, deputies said. He later died. “The individual felt threatened. One of the suspects reached for something, (the witness) thought it was a weapon or a firearm,” Nieves said.  Deputies said the customer believed the suspects were armed and was assisting a Walmart employee who confronted the suspects.— Julie Salomone (@JSalomoneWFTV) February 4, 2017 Nieves said the four suspects got into the maroon Nissan Rogue and fled the scene. The Nissan was reported stolen during a carjacking on Jan. 13, deputies said.  Deputies said the driver hit two vehicles in the parking lot, causing one of the cars to spin. The suspect who was shot by the witness got out of the car at some point and went to a Citgo gas station. The three other suspects are still being sought. Deputies said the investigation is ongoing and the witness who opened fire is cooperating with the investigation. Deputies have not said if the witness will face any charges.

 5 things smart people never pay full price for Morgan Quinn, GOBankingRates Oct. 14, 2016, 3:50 PM 113,242 facebook linkedin twitter email print Joshua Lott/Getty Images Rich people don't accumulate wealth by spending their money carelessly. Some wealthy people are self-made and used to thrifty living, while others just prefer to spend less and save more. Either way, there are certain things successful people simply don't pay full price for. Here are some of the top things that rich people and celebrities avoid spending their money on. 1. Cars According to Brian Davis, real estate investor with Spark Rental, successful people never pay full price for cars. "The rich know that everything in life is negotiable," said Davis. "Every service, every commodity, even many physical products. And the trick to negotiation is finding other things the selling party wants, besides money." He went on to explain that car salespeople and dealerships are striving to meet quotas as well as price points. "A savvy buyer might show up on the last day of the month and say ‘I'm buying a car today. I might buy an Infiniti or I might buy an Acura, but I'm not willing to pay anywhere near full price. What is the absolute lowest price you can offer me on these three models?'" said Davis. Related: The Least – And Most – Expensive States to Own a Car It's not just successful people who don't have to pay full price for cars — the rest of us can cash in on this strategy, too. If you're in the market for a new car, Davis recommended collecting internet quotes on the models you are interested in, researching the wholesale prices and being willing to walk away if the salesperson won't give you the deal you desire. 2. Retail goods Wealthy people might enjoy perusing the aisles of popular luxury retailers, but the truth is that they rarely spend money there. Millionaire Corner, a wealth management news site, surveyed 1,200 investors to ask which retailers they actually shopped from. Among the respondents with a net worth of $5 million or more, Home Depot, Lowe's and Target were the most popular retail stores. Nearly half the respondents said they like to shop at Costco, while a third shop at Walmart. Bargain retail chains aren't just popular among successful people — celebrities love these stores, too. Gwen Stefani, Heidi Klum and Kylie Jenner are all Target fans. Jessica Alba, Zac Efron and Shia LaBeouf hit up the local Home Depot, and Britney Spears, Rihanna and Justin Bieber have been spotted at Walmart. Finally, even Jimmy Kimmel bought his wedding band at Costco. Stars — they‘re just like us! In addition to shopping at discount stores, the wealthy love clipping coupons. Despite having a net worth that Forbes pegs at $31 million, Carmelo Anthony uses coupons to cut his grocery bill. "I go to the supermarket, make sure I get the newspaper and tear the coupons out; save a dollar or two," Anthony told CBS Denver. Self-admitted cheapskate, and actress, Kristen Bell also loves to use coupons when shopping. "I almost exclusively shop with coupons," she told talk show host Conan O'Brien. The actress, who jokes about nicking her neighbor's 20 percent off Bed Bath & Beyond coupons, said, "If you go and buy a duvet or air conditioner or whatever, you could be saving upwards of $80." These days, you don't need to grab a flyer at the grocery store or snag your neighbor's mailers — you can easily score incredible coupons online. Discounts on everything from clothing and electronics to diapers and makeup are available at the click of your finger. Some of our favorite online coupon sites include Coupons.com, RetailMeNot.com, SlickDeals.net, DealNews.com and CouponSherpa.com. 3. Travel The richer you are, the less you pay for certain luxuries — including travel. According to a survey by Fidelity, 55 percent of credit card holders have rewards credit cards. While cash back was the most popular reward, free travel also ranked high on the list. Successful people use their spending power to score everything from free flights to first-class upgrades and access to premier boarding rooms. And when you have a lot of money, you can easily put more on a credit card — and pay it off — to rack up as many points as possible. However, there are ways you can score a luxury travel experience at a discount, even if you aren't wealthy. For example, there are many travel rewards credit cards out there for regular consumers and, with a little strategizing, you can score free airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars or first-class upgrades. There's even a service called JetSuite that offers next-day deals on private jet flights. Right now, the company is booking seats starting at just $129. 4. Real estate While the average person pays about a 6 percent commission fee to a real estate agent, successful people tend to pay much less — especially when selling their homes. "Successful people never pay a 6 percent commission," said Sissy Lappin, author of "Simple and Sold" and founder of ListingDoor. "They always negotiate when they are selling a home." This strategy is particularly beneficial if you’re selling a home that’s worth millions. For example, a $2 million home could net a real estate agent a $120,000 paycheck if he or she takes the standard 6 percent fee. Negotiating the rate down by half saves the owner $60,000, and the agent still walks away with a fat paycheck. Even if you aren’t in the market for a multimillion-dollar home, you can still negotiate your way to a better price. According to Zillow, shoppers in a buyers' market can score great deals by "asking for the moon." Start by making an initial offer that’s at least 10% under the price you're actually willing to pay and ask for any furniture and appliances you desire. You should also ask the seller to pay all the closing costs and set a closing date that works best for you. Best-case scenario, the seller accepts. Worst-case scenario (as long as you haven’t offended him or her), the seller counters. 5. Higher education Many private colleges slash prices for families that are rich enough to afford full tuition. Known as merit aid, this discount is used to lure academic all-stars to the school or make sure the institution enrolls enough wealthy students to meet financial targets. Among the dozens of elite private schools that provide financial aid unrelated to athletics or need, George Washington University offers funds to 20% of freshman; Tulane University to 37%; and Washington University in St. Louis to 14%, according to the Washington Post. And in the 2013-14 school year, Duke University provided scholarships worth an average of $56,000 a year to 67 freshman with no financial need. Merit aid might not be available to all students, but there are still ways to get a four-year degree for free. Forbes reports that there are about a dozen schools in the U.S. classified as "tuition-free" institutions. For example, Barclay College is a four-year Bible school that provides a full tuition scholarship to every student who enrolls at its Haviland, Kan., location. Prestigious conservatory Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia covers the tuition of each admitted student, and America's service academies — the Coast Guard, Air Force and Military and Naval academies — don't charge tuition, but they do usually require a service commitment of five years after graduation.

Instead of having suppliers at the retailer’s year beginning meetings held as in the past, Wal-Mart is holding a two-day Supplier Growth Forum Feb. 15-16 at the John Q Hammons Convention Center in Rogers. Suppliers have plenty of questions given the recent announcement in the retailer’s replenishment division and ongoing changes being made at Walmart.com under the leadership of new CEO Mark Lore. Suppliers are likely to hear from McMillon, Walmart U.S. CEO Greg Foran and Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna either in the opening or closing segments. The opening session is slated for two hours, then suppliers will hear from executives regarding private brands and the categories of hardlines (non-personal items like sporting equipment and electronics) entertainment and seasonal. The next session will deal with operational excellence for direct store delivery (DSD) suppliers. These suppliers bypass the distribution center. Items that are commonly DSD include bread, soft drinks like Coca Cola as well as chips and other snacks from suppliers like Kraft and Frito-Lay. The last session on Wednesday Feb. 15 will review in-store events. This has been a push by McMillon in the past few years trying to get suppliers to sponsor events and bring more excitement through retailtainment into the stores. Last year Walmart U.S. Chief Marketing Officer Tony Rogers announced “Walmart’s New Every Friday” program where customers can sample new products which are highlighted around the stores. Rogers said the company put together a retailtainment committee comprised of merchants and merchandisers to ensure stores around the country are seen as destinations for friends and families. Rogers made the announcement in June 2016 and to date the response from suppliers has been a somewhat lackluster (at least locally) based on a number of stores in Northwest Arkansas routinely visited on Fridays. Insiders expected Wal-Mart to make another push for suppliers to take part as Rogers said the retailer has learned there be a 300% lift in sales when a new product is demonstrated in stores for customers. Day two of the conference will include a session on digital acceleration, not a surprise given Wal-Mart’s efforts expand its e-commerce capabilities in its U.S. business. The retailer also is in the midst of restructuring the e-commerce division amid a recent layoff off 200 workers and a new management team assembled by Lore. Eric Howerton, CEO of WhyteSpyder, expects the retailer will again urge suppliers to get onboard with the mandate for unique product content for all items sold on Walmart.com. He said there has been hesitancy among some consumer packaged good vendors to provide Walmart.com product content that is not also provided to competitors like Amazon. “Walmart.com wants the content to be uniquely theirs, highly searchable with photos and videos where applicable,” Howerton said. “Too many suppliers are merely compliant with the bare minimum content and missing opportunities to grow in-store sales which is high on McMillon’s radar.” Suppliers will also hear about direct import possibilities. This topic is timely given the talk of an adjusted border tax for imports by the President Donald Trump’s administration. Wal-Mart is among a retail consortium to protest this tax. McMillon was also among the CEO’s asked to meet with Trump on Friday (Feb. 3) in the nation’s capitol. Wal-Mart will hold a two-hour closing session with suppliers to wrap up the two-day summit. More information on hardlines will be discussed in this session as well as expectations for suppliers as the retailer begins a new fiscal year.

(AP) — Investigators say a customer who fatally shot a man suspected of stealing diapers from a Wal-Mart store in Florida also injured a second person. Orange County Sheriff's Capt. Angelo Nieves tells local news outlets that three men left the store in Orlando with stolen items Saturday and were loading the merchandise into a vehicle when a store employee approached them. An armed customer heard the commotion and came to the employee's aid. Nieves says the customer thought 19-year-old Arthur Adams was going for a gun and fired his weapon. Initially deputies thought the customer only shot Adams but later learned a juvenile girl sitting in the vehicle was hit in the leg. She fled the scene and went to a hospital hours later. A third suspect is still being sought. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

The first arrest stemmed from a report of a man who allegedly stole merchandise and fled from the store. As Herkimer police were en route to the scene, they were contacted by State DEC officers who told them a man was running westbound on Route 5. A vehicle was stopped which was occupied by 38-year-old George Eissler of Mohawk and operated by a female. During the course of the investigation, it was learned that Eissler was in possession of items alleged to have been stolen. He was arrested and charged with Petit Larceny and will appear in village court at a later date. The second arrest came as a result of a report of a male pushing a cart of stolen merchandise through the locked doors, removing them from the track. Officers arrived and located a male matching the description, running while pushing the cart of merchandise toward a vehicle. He was directed by police to stop, but he continued to attempt to flee. He was apprehended by police, and the manager of the store was able to identify him as the man who allegedly stole the merchandise. 26-year-old Michael Curcio was arrested, transported to the Police Station and charged with Petit Larceny and Obstruction. He was processed and held for arraignment. He has been remanded to Herkimer County Correctional Facility.

But costs for employers increased just 2.5 percent across all prescription drugs, Express Scripts said in its new Drug Trend Report, released Monday. The St. Louis-based PBM, which negotiates drug prices on behalf of insurers and employers, hailed the difference in figures as evidence that it saves the system money. "In a year where the issue of high drug prices was No. 1 on the list of payer and policymaker concerns, the data show that our solutions protected our clients and patients," Dr. Glen Stettin, chief innovation officer at Express Scripts, said in a statement. But drug companies, growing increasingly public in their battle with PBMs, may use the same figures to fuel their arguments that the middlemen help push list prices up. Drug manufacturers say it's the rebates, or discounts, wrangled by PBMs that drive list prices higher; PBMs take a percentage of the rebates, the rest of which they pass on to clients. So the bigger the rebate, the more PBMs take home. It's a debate that gained steam last summer, when Mylan CEO Heather Bresch pointed her finger at PBMs and other members of the health-care system as a reason for the skyrocketing price of her company's EpiPen epinephrine auto-injector. Since then, other drug companies have joined the chorus, and industry group PhRMA released a study last month saying brand drug companies keep only 47 percent of total U.S. prescription drug spending. Drug industry analysts seized on the figures Monday. "Two. Point. Five. Percent," Evercore ISI's Mark Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients. "I understand that the pharma/biotech industry is an easy political target. But the facts aren't really so offensive." It's a narrative Express Scripts, and other PBMs, reject. "Rebates do not raise drug prices, drugmakers do," Express Scripts' Stettin said in the statement Monday. Mike Mergen | Bloomberg | Getty Images A pharmacy technician fills a prescription inside a Wal-Mart store in Trevose, Pennsylvania. Indeed, Ross Muken, who covers pharmacy benefits managers for Evercore ISI, took the opposite side from his colleague in a note Monday. "We view this year's iteration of the drug trend report to be a base of defense against the recent uptick in Pharma lobby noise," Muken wrote. Still, he conceded, "The reality is that while many of the main causes of inflation are certainly the responsibility of the pharma industry, the supply chain has none the less benefited in many instances." The average list price for a brand drug last year was $307.86, more than triple what it was in 2008, Express Scripts said in its report. It compared that with price inflation for common household items during that same period, of 14 percent. The debate over drug prices is nothing new, but it snowballed leading into the 2016 U.S. presidential election. President Donald Trump, in his first news conference, said the pharmaceutical industry was "getting away with murder" in its pricing practices. In a meeting last week with several pharma CEOs, Trump praised the industry for its contributions to human health, while still saying prices need to come down. Some drug companies have made commitments to limit price increases, Allergan most publicly with a "social contract" promising to limit increases to less than 10 percent annually. Drugmakers made a similar pledge in 1993 under scrutiny from President Bill Clinton, vowing to keep increases on average in line with inflation. The consumer price index rose 2.1 percent for the 12 months ended in December, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Sixto Mercado, vice president of top trade lobby Canaive’s branch in Jalisco State, home to Guadajara said that it would be a good idea if the government did something to compensate against this [the Trump tariff]. As they have many apparel exporters here who would be affected. However, Mexico is set to begin negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement by May to meet Trump’s calls for a rewrite. The economy minister Ildefonso Guajardo said that in mid-January if Trump imposes a tariff or a border adjustment tax, Mexico would pursue “mirror actions.” The statement is an indication of the growing tensions between the two neighboring countries, longtime allies, as Trump pursues his plan to build a wall along the border and claims that Mexico will pay for it. The 20 percent tariff or other duty proposal forms part of the plan to fund the wall. The U.S. ships roughly $6.5 billion worth of apparel and textiles to Mexico — $4 billion is fabric and $1.2 billion apparel parts, according to Canaive. Conversely, Mexico sends back $4.5 billion worth of clothing and textiles — $3.5 billion of apparel and $1 billion of textiles. A possible trade war has strained diplomatic relations and unleashed a nationalist uproar in Mexico with populist groups calling for consumers to boycott American companies including Wal-Mart, Starbucks and McDonalds. Social media is abuzz with tweets-for-tats urging citizens buy Mexican goods with hashtags such as #AdiosWalmart, allegedly hitting sales at the U.S. discounter’s largest international division. A Wal-Mart spokesman said that the firm is “monitoring the situation” but had no further comment. If the proposed 20 percent tariff is levied (among other options) to pay for Trump’s border wall and Mexico hits back, they could grow below zero, Mercado said, adding that exports could plunge 10 percent, despite a record-low peso. In 2016, the textiles and apparel sector grew 5 percent as strong local apparel sales offset a 4.3 percent drop in U.S. sales. As Mexico flirts with a possible recession, Mixto said that local sales could this year grow 7 percent compared to 10 percent in 2016. Amid strong anti-American sentiment, local-brand turnover could eclipse U.S. brands for the first time in recent memory. Everyone is being urged to buy Mexican products. This will hit American brand sales. Many consumers could shun Wal-Mart in lieu of Mexican archrival Coppel or choose to buy at department-store chain Liverpool’s lower-end unit Fabricas de Francia. Mexican fashion designers, long in the shadows, could win consumer hearts. This is bad news for the likes of the Axo or El Palacio de Hierro network, which have grown by bringing aspirational U.S. brands such as ck Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Abercrombie & Fitch south of the border. An executive at Axo said that the 20-brand franchisor has not seen “any sales declines” from the patriotic upsurge and is operating “business-as-usual.” It’s clear Axo and rival Sordo Madaleno, a top architecture firm making a leap into foreign fashion licensing (it just opened Mexico’s first AllSaints outlet) will suffer as consumers tighten their belts and seek “Made in Mexico.” In Europe, Mexican fashion jean labels Oggi and Siete Leguas could make successful forays because they have high-quality products using innovative fabrics and new washing technologies, according to Mercado. These companies sell premium jeans to Levi’s, Wrangler and True Religion so they could also start selling in Europe. That will require even more innovation, training and other investment the industry has been slow to pursue. They need to make more fashion and design and to diversify their exports because they are too dependent on the U.S., said Alfonso Zepeda, the man behind Expo Denim, a denim trade fair set to open in Guadjalajara in late May, adding that European expansion should be a priority. Here in Jalisco they make great coats, cotton knits, denim pants and suits. They could sell these to smaller, H&M-like stores. Europe represents a huge opportunity with their low peso and there are niches they could exploit Mexican apparel producers to meet the challenges are seeking new markets in Central America and Europe with which Mexico has a largely vague free-trade agreement. Costa Rica, Panama and Central America could be good markets to compete on price and quality. 0 YarnsandFibers News Bureau Cotton prices move higher on short supply of quality cotton Turkish duty on US cotton to hit competiveness of its own textile exports View All...

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

During his campaign, Trump said the United States pays too much of the cost for the alliance, and he would make some NATO members contribute more money, defending those who have "fulfilled their obligations to us." Catherine Garcia   Trump says he'll go to NATO summit in May February 6, 2017 Only in America Edit 'Leftist Fight Club' teaches Florida college students how to fight Trump supporters February 10, 2017   iStock A group of students at the University of Central Florida hosted a "Leftist Fight Club" event to train liberal students to defend themselves against Trump supporters and "other Alt-Right Neo-Nazis," Fox News reports. An amateur boxer was on hand to demonstrate hand-to-hand combat techniques, and the clinic was billed as open to "everyone except Republicans." Event planners specifically encouraged women to attend the event, saying the president "is a sexual predator and rapist." The university said the group that sponsored the event, called the "Knights for Socialism," is not a registered student group and is not officially affiliated with the school.

Gayle McCormick, 73, a Democrat, had not previously fought about politics with her conservative husband, but she felt "betrayed" by his decision to vote for Trump, Reuters reports. "It totally undid me that he could vote for Trump," McCormick said. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 13 percent of Americans had ended relationships over the presidential election. Some 16 percent of the 6,426 respondents said they've stopped talking to a family member or friend over the results The Week Staff   This California woman is divorcing her husband of 22 years because he voted for Trump February 10, 2017 This just in Edit U.S. investigators reportedly confirm some details of Russia dossier February 10, 2017   Mario Tama/Getty Images U.S. investigators have been able to confirm some details of the 35-page dossier claiming Russia has compromising information on President Trump, CNN reported Friday. Up until this point, investigators had been unable to verify the claims asserted in the document, which was compiled by a retired British intelligence agent and revealed to the public Jan. 10. CNN said that while the dossier's more "salacious" claims remain unverified, investigators have corroborated details about some of the communications "between senior Russian officials and other Russian individuals." The dossier includes "a dozen" conversations between foreign nationals, and investigators have been able to confirm that "some of the conversations described in the dossier took place between the same individuals on the same days and from the same locations as detailed in the dossier" after intercepting communications during "routine intelligence gathering," CNN said. Some of the individuals involved in the intercepted communications were previously found to be "heavily involved" in leaking information from Democratic organizations that proved harmful to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. CNN did not reveal specifics, including whether these latest findings are at all connected to Trump, but the confirmations have given U.S. intelligence "greater confidence" in the dossier's credibility. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer responded to CNN's request for comment combatively: "We continue to be disgusted by CNN's fake news reporting," Spicer said, echoing Trump's previous dismissals of the reports as "phony stuff." Spokespeople for various intelligence agencies declined to comment.

The Volta V ($1,999) harks back to that minimalist 1970s aesthetic, when long-haired nerds had to build their own cases out of wood. Available in a fully assembled bamboo and walnut case, this "simple but elegant" desktop computer comes "packed with the latest technology," says Joshua Fruhlinger at The Wall Street Journal. That includes a high-end motherboard, graphics card, and solid-state hard drive. Like the DIY computers of yore, it has modular components that can be upgraded for years to come. Just lift the magnetized lid and swap parts as you please.

"To be honest, the idea of a 'trophy girl' has felt antiquated for some time now," Portnow said in a statement. "Who wrote that rule anyway? The ability to present a trophy has nothing to do with one's gender." Portnow explained the change wasn't intended to be "provocative or buck convention," The Associated Press noted, but to recognize that "music's universal power lies in its spirit of inclusion." The three trophy handlers for the 2017 Grammys are transgender model Martina Robledo, model and actor Derek Marrocco, and model and actress Hollin Haley. The Grammys will be hosted by James Corden and air Sunday, Feb. 12 on CBS at 8 p.m. ET. There will be performances by Chance the Rapper, who is nominated for seven Grammy awards, as well as Beyoncé, Adele, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga and Metallica, and Carrie Underwood and Keith Urban.

The gathering was intended to be a discussion about Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. Politico reported that as soon as reporters exited the room, Trump began telling the group of senators how both he and former Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) — who lost her re-election bid and is now serving as a Capitol Hill liaison for Trump on Gorsuch's nomination — were victims of a rigged election. Ayotte was in the room, as was White House Counsel Don McGahn. Trump obviously won the election, but he narrowly lost New Hampshire to Hillary Clinton. He told senators Thursday that was because of the "thousands" of people "brought in on buses" from Massachusetts to "illegally vote" in New Hampshire. The room reportedly responded with an "uncomfortable silence." Trump indicated that this voter fraud, of which there is no evidence, had also affected Ayotte, though he suggested her loss might have also had something to do with her decision to distance herself from him after he criticized the parents of a Muslim Gold Star soldier. "He told her, 'You'd have won if you'd been on my train," a participant told Politico. Then, as the cherry on top of that crumbling cake, Trump told Democrats he was glad "Pocahontas" — his chosen nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — was "becoming the face of 'your party,'" Politico reported. Trump has repeatedly claimed millions voted illegally in the presidential election, causing him to lose the popular vote to Clinton, but he has yet to produce any evidence to substantiate those claims. Becca Stanek   President Trump reportedly told the Senate a totally bananas lie about voter fraud February 10, 2017 big pupper is watching you Edit Your dog is constantly judging you February 10, 2017   It's not just your parents who want you to be nice to other people. New research by scientists at Kyoto University has found that dogs judge humans based on how they treat other people, New Scientist reports: … The researchers tested whether dogs preferred people who helped their owner. Each owner tried to open a container then presented it to one of two actors. This actor either helped or refused to do so, while the other actor was passive. Then the two actors offered the dog a reward and it chose between them. The dogs had no preference when the first actor had helped their owner, but were more likely to choose the passive actor if the first one had refused to help. [New Scientist] Dogs evolved closely alongside humans, which means they are particularly sensitive to how people act. The Kyoto study also tested monkeys, and found similar results, with the primates preferring people who acted kindly or generously. Even human morality might be evolutionary: "I think that in humans there may be this basic sensitivity towards antisocial behavior in others. Then through growing up, inculturation and teaching, it develops into a full-blown sense of morality,” said comparative psychologist James Anderson. Watch the dogs make judgments in the study below.

The teenager was allegedly loading the merchandise into a stolen vehicle with three to four other people Saturday morning when the customer saw an employee at the Pine Hills store confronting the suspects and attempted to help, the Orlando Sentinel reported. “While helping the employee, the customer felt threatened by one of the suspects, who the customer believed was arming himself,” Orange County Sheriff Capt. Angelo Nieves stated in a press release. WESH-TV A box of diapers rests in the parking lot of a Florida Walmart after an alleged shoplifting incident turned deadly. “The customer who had a firearm of his own fired to defend himself and the suspects all jumped into their red vehicle and attempted to flee,” he stated. WFTV reported that the teenager was shot multiple times. A witness speaking to WESH-TV said she heard as many as eight shots fired. The suspects took off in their vehicle before crashing it into two other cars in the parking lot. They then abandoned the vehicle and took off on foot. The 19-year-old who had been shot attempted to flee into a nearby gas station but collapsed once inside. He was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead. The suspects’ vehicle was later identified as having been stolen in a Jan. 14 carjacking, Nieves said. No arrests have been made in the case. Authorities said they are still considering whether charges will be pressed against the customer who fired the gun. “We have a situation where someone rendered aid, they provided assistance to someone else. Currently they’re being cooperative and they’re providing information and statements,” Nieves said of the customer at a press conference Saturday.

Today we ask Malcolm Scovil, Head of Business Development at Tophatter, to tell us more about the opportunity and how sellers can sign up. To be honest, when I heard it was an auction based marketplace I was a little sceptical – aren’t auctions a bit 1999 and buyers prefer fixed price immediate purchases today? However the thing Tophatter has going for it is mobile, once you’ve got the app installed and a constant fast moving stream of products instantly available to bid on it’s easy to get a little carried away and start spending. Of course my initial impressions don’t really matter, what counts is can you shift product at scale on Tophatter and will you make margins which are profitable? These are questions we put to Malcolm and he had some interesting answers to share: What is Tophatter? Tophatter.com is the world’s fastest, most entertaining marketplace for mobile shoppers. This week, we’re announcing our launch to the UK online seller community. Over 10 million shoppers around the world discover deals on jewelry, accessories, electronics, beauty, home and other impulse items. Tophatter started 5 years ago in Palo Alto, California. The founders wanted to make shopping more fun and game-like. They created a new buying format around 90 second auctions. Imagine an eBay auction, but just the last two minutes where all the action happens. Can you share some statistics about your business? Tophatter is 5 years old 80 employees Industry-leading 80% sell through rate Average selling price £10 – £40 (up to £100+ for branded items) 500,000 items sold each week 75,000 unique shoppers per day 10 million shoppers 90% of shoppers are women aged 18-65 Over 300,000 new shoppers each month Top seller generates $10 million + per year on Tophatter App available on iOS and Android in US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa. France, Germany, Spain launching soon. What makes Tophatter exciting for UK eBay and Amazon sellers? Tophatter is now a major mobile shopping platform alongside Amazon, eBay, Sears, Walmart and other leading marketplaces. If you’re a professional online seller, there are several reasons to sell on Tophatter. Guaranteed exposure for your products. Every item is featured on the front of the mobile app and website.

In an age when eBay and other platforms are moving away from auctions, Tophatter re-invented the auction to be faster and mobile optimised for the modern-day shopper. Seller-Focused. We call our sellers ‘Partners’. Our team aims to understand your business goals, help you get started, and sell 500-5,000 items per week. Get started fast. Tools to boost performance, insights to track best-selling products and an Account Manager you can actually speak with on the phone. Only pay when you sell.

They sell fashion jewelry on multiple ecommerce marketplaces. They came to Tophatter looking for a new channel to grow sales. In their first full month they sold 500 items. They then added 200 top performing products and scaled within three months to selling over 7,000 products per month. Within six months, they are on track to sell 20,000 items per month.   What makes Tophatter exciting for UK shoppers? Tophatter is a marketplace for shoppers that enjoy game-like, impulse buying. It’s very different to Amazon and eBay. The 90 second auction format means sellers experience the thrill of winning (or losing) in under two minutes. This adrenaline and instant gratification is unique to Tophatter. The most common word we see in shopper reviews is that Tophatter is ‘addictive’. Here is an example: “Addictive!! I found this site to be very efficient and hassle free. It has become a daily habit for me to visit this site at least 10 times a day. Love it!! – Opal M, January 2017 How does selling on Tophatter work? Similar to eBay, sellers list and ship their own items. Sellers simply add their inventory (manually, via CSV, API, ChannelAdvisor, etc) and start seeing sales within a few hours. There are no fees to list or start selling. You only pay when an item sells. How much volume can sellers expect to sell per week? Most new sellers start by adding a few products to test out the platform. Once you’ve added your first 50-100 SKUs sellers see volume growing significantly. New sellers sell 100-1,000 items each week within their first 1-2 months. Top Sellers grow to sell 5,000-10,000+ items per week. What products sell best on Tophatter? Top categories are Jewelry, Apparel, Electronics, Home, Accessories, and other impulse items. Women come to Tophatter to find deals and gifts for themselves and their friends and family. They also shop at Walmart/Asda, QVC, Home Shopping Network, and similar stores. Items in the impulse price range sell best: from £10 – £40. Top SKUs are bracelets, rings, handbags, drones, smart watches, footwear, and similar items. What is the profile of a typical seller on Tophatter? Tophatter sellers are experienced ecommerce sellers and sell on Amazon, eBay, Groupon, and similar marketplaces. Most of them are actively looking for new marketplaces and channels to grow their business. They understand the power of being on a marketplace early. Mid-sized and large sellers receive 500 to 10,000 orders from Tophatter each week. Top Sellers generate millions dollars per year on Tophatter. Increasingly, larger businesses and brands are selling on Tophatter to move impulse items or products for liquidation. How do your selling prices compare to other marketplaces? As a seller on Tophatter, the key metric is Average Selling Price (ASP). Some items sell for more than other marketplaces. Some items sell for less. To get the highest ASP, the key is to set starting prices low so several bidders compete to win your products. What are the mistakes to avoid as a new seller on Tophatter? Hundreds of new sellers joining Tophatter each month. There are 3 common pitfalls we see some new sellers make. 1. Setting starting prices too high Low starting prices drive more bidders. That means a higher average selling price for sellers. 2. Adding a small number of products We recommend that all new sellers add at least 100 products when they start selling. This gives our system enough data to determine what’s selling best so we can sell that item more. It’s easy to add them via CSV. 3. Not leveraging your Account Manager Account Managers help sellers ramp quickly, identify successful products, and give advice on how to scale their account. The Tophatter Seller Hub is also a helpful tool for new sellers. Why are RRPs on your site so high, often in $100s compared to selling prices in low $10s. Is this misleading buyers? As a young marketplace, we are constantly trying to patrol exploitations. RRPs are a bit tricky as they do not apply to everything, they can change, or differ by channel. We have adopted the policy to allow sellers to enter RRPs, but if this is abused it will very likely have a negative result for the seller. After the sale, we do the following to ensure a positive experience moving forward: Offer easy returns If the product is not what the customer was expecting they will receive a refund no questions asked. Throttle undesirable products Inflated RRPs will lead to lower product ratings and reduce the number of times items get scheduled in auctions. How does a consumer know the shipping cost up front (e.g. from a Chinese seller to a UK buyer)? Sellers set shipping prices for each region where they ship. Shoppers see the shipping cost to them (based on their location) marked on the item listing when they are bidding. Where are your sellers mainly based (USA/China/UK/Other)? Most of our sellers are in the in the US. Asia was our second major market that opened last year and is growing well. Now we’re launching to sellers in the UK and Europe as our third major market. The Tophatter app is live for shoppers in the US, UK, Australia, and the UK. It will soon be available in France, Germany, and Spain. As a seller, you only have to list items once and they appear for buyers in all countries where you choose to sell. What is the proposition for sellers (fees etc)? Sellers can simple sign up and get started. There are no ongoing monthly fees or listing fees. Sellers pay an average of £3.00 to £4.00 each time an item sells in an auction and a flat 10% each time an item sells in a Buy Now. This amount is deducted from the payouts sellers receive on the 1st and 16th day of the month. There is a payment processing fee of 2.9% + £0.25 on all transactions. What else would you like to tell Tamebay’s readers? Our approach to launching in Europe is to engage closely with the seller community. We’ll be attending the Spring Fair in February, Internet Retailing Expo in April, and Catalyst Connect in May and look forward to meeting UK and European sellers in person.

The Orange County Sheriff's Office said in a statement that the shooting occurred Saturday after suspects left the store with stolen items. Sheriff's Capt. A.L. Nieves says the men were loading the merchandise into a car when a worker and a customer who came to the employee's aid confronted them. Nieves says the customer was armed and fired at a suspect, who he thought was going for a weapon. Nieves did not identify anyone involved. The suspect later died at a hospital after deputies found him at a gas station. The shooting is under investigation, and the remaining robbery suspects remain at large.

Photo: Facebook.com/MissingZoeCampos Image 33 of 33 Missing for 3 years, family offers reward for Texas man 1 / 33 Back to Gallery A Texas man went to Wal-Mart three years ago. Someone spotted him driving away. Since then, John Terry hasn't been seen or heard from. Now, Terry's family and friends have raised $10,000 and Hill County investigators say they're taking a fresh look at what may have happened to him. Haley Carmona, a family friend who is leading a fundraising effort for the reward money, said Terry's two sons and family just want to bring him home. FEW SIGNS: Police found her car, but no other sign of missing Texas woman "We owe it to the family and to the boys and to John to find out exactly what happened," Carmona told KWTX-TV. Terry was last seen Oct. 17, 2014 driving away from the Wal-Mart in Hillsboro. Deputies found his abandoned pickup truck the next day on Hill County Road 2346 with the windows down and the keys still inside. In a puzzling twist, deputies also found blood and other evidence they've declined to discuss in Terry's home. CRUEL DISCOVERIES: 2 weeks, 2 bodies found by search crew, but not the woman they sought Terry, who is listed with Texas Equuisearch and in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons database, was last seen wearing a black shirt with red lettering, a gray ball and jeans. He has brown hair, a full beard, stands 5-foot-9 and weighs about 180 pounds. Investigators ask anyone with information about his whereabouts to call the Hill County Sheriff’s Office at (254) 582-5313. LAWRENCE, MASSACHUSETTS — Family and friends are mourning the loss of a Massachusetts teen who was horrifically beheaded by a classmate. The Boston Globe reports that Lee Manuel Viloria-Paulino disappeared on Nov. 18, leaving behind his phone and wallet. The teen’s family had filed a missing person’s report, but authorities considered him a runaway and largely ignored the case. Two weeks later, a woman walking her dog along the Merrimack River spotted his body near the riverbank. He had been decapitated and gruesomely mutilated. Both arms were hacked below the elbow, and his head was lying about 50 feet away. Police investigating the brutal slaying believe it was carried out by Viloria-Paulino’s classmate, 16-year-old Matthew Borges, but have not disclosed a motive for the murder. Borges was arrested on Saturday after authorities found evidence linking him to the killing. He is expected to be charged as an adult with first-degree murder.

Lock and Dam No. 4 can be seen in the background. As seen on Wednesday, Feb. 1, 2017. Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. Robin Bergstrom always had a vision of getting fitness-minded people safely around Harrison. The township commissioner is closing in on that goal. Bergstrom, in November, landed a $50,000 grant through the Redevelopment Authority of Allegheny County's Active Allegheny Program. She plans to use it to design upgrades to Harrison's section of the Three Rivers Heritage Trail to make it safer for commuters. Active Allegheny grants are designed to provide assistance to communities to help them develop plans and design transportation projects that increase opportunities for physical activity and provide bicycle and pedestrian connections to local destinations. Harrison is one of the first municipalities to receive a grant from the program, which is only a year old. Harrison's designated trail is passable but not really safe, Bergstrom said. She has concerns about traffic and people walking, biking and using wheelchairs along sections of roadway that don't have sidewalks. “There's so many people right now that walk to Wal-Mart plaza, but there's no sidewalks so they're walking on the street, or they're walking on the curb at some points and kind of doing a tight-rope act,” she said. “I'm a biker myself, so I always wanted it to be as safe as it could for other people to get around.” Planning forward Harrison's designated sections of the trail encompass sections of Broadview Boulevard, Freeport Road and River Avenue. Those areas will be the focus points of the project. Some of the proposed upgrades include handicapped-accessible traffic intersections, adding sidewalks where there aren't any and implementing trail designation signage. Also under discussion is whether one lane of Spring­hill Road, which connects Freeport Road in Natrona Heights to the township's Natrona section, can be transformed into a bike lane. “This has been something I've been thinking about for a while,” Bergstrom said. Bergstrom is sending out design proposals for the project, which will be done in these three phases: • Broadview Boulevard and continue through the Heights Plaza Shopping Center and Alsco Park. • Freeport Road to the Wal-Mart Plaza and Harrison Hills Park. • River Avenue through Natrona. River Avenue will need to be connected to the two sections via Springhill Road, which intersects with McWilliams Drive at Alsco Park. Bergstrom said the trail along River Avenue will be the most difficult to upgrade. On one side, there is the ATI Flat-Rolled Products steel mill and River Avenue. On the other, there are steep banks along the Allegheny River. There will be a need for construction in that area, Bergstrom said, but at this time she is “not sure what to do with it.” “It's a challenge,” she said. Along Freeport Road at the Wal-Mart plaza, Bergstrom has witnessed people using wheelchairs, pushing strollers, and walking and biking along one lane of the road because there aren't sidewalks. She has seen pedestrians and bicyclists moving similarly on Springhill Road. “Someone's going to get hit,” Bergstrom said. She plans to meet with residents and township officials to get their input on the designs. She hopes to complete a conceptual design by July, and a detailed design within six months after that. The township will be applying for subsequent grants for the detailed design and implementation of the upgrades. If those grants are approved, construction could start by as early as summer or fall 2018. “We're real excited,” Bergstrom said. “I think this is an opportunity for us to make the town look good and to provide some healthy options for people, too.” Safety, health, opportunity The goal of the Three Rivers Heritage Trail is to connect Downtown Pittsburgh to Harrison Hills Park, but some parts aren't completed. Upgrades to Harrison's part of the trail will help toward that goal. Upgrading Harrison's section of the trail could draw the attention of more serious bikers because the Allegheny County park offers passage to the Rachel Carson Trail, the Tredway Trail and Freeport-Butler Trail. Though the main goal of the upgrades is to make the township safer and healthier, Bergstrom said there could be some economic benefits. “We definitely think it would help the town ... especially down in the Natrona area, where you have the river­front,” Bergstrom said. “We have a kayak launch, we have a beautiful park down there, we have a dam there where there's fishing. “If people could bike up and they could fish, they could take their kids to the playground as a little stop-off and kind of have a nice little day.” Bob Mulshine is president of the Rachel Carson Trails Conservancy, which is dedicated to the development, protection and promotion of hiking, biking and walking trails throughout Western Pennsylvania. Mulshine said upgrades to Harrison's section of the Three Rivers Heritage Trail would be beneficial because people are more likely to bike if they have better access to trails. “Freeport Road was upgraded a while back, but it didn't really get a nice shoulder or sidewalks along the side of it, so the main entry to the park is on a road that has fairly fast traveling traffic,” Mulshine said. “Today's day and age, people are busy. If you can roll out of your garage (on your bicycle), you're an awful lot more likely to do that than if you have to get a bike rack put on your car ... drive with that someplace and then have to take it off.” Madasyn Czebiniak is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

As the economy worsens, the need to move product decreases, and more people are willing to sign on to drive despite the stresses of long distance hauls. Tim Dominick tdominick@thestate.com i By Jeff Wilkinson jwilkinson@thestate.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The signs are everywhere. You pull up to your favorite fast-food restaurant, and they have posted “Now hiring all levels.” Or the lines at the big box discount stores are longer. These are all signs that the economy, which reeled for years through the Great Recession, is not only on the mend, but is rolling. “Those long lines at Wal-Mart mean two things,” said Lewis Gossett, chief executive of the South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance, whose membership is beginning to feel the pinch of higher production demands coupled with a tightening job market. “More people are buying things, and the store can’t find enough help. “People have more options today,” he said. “And they are stepping up to the next level of work.” Here are five lesser-known indicators that the economy is moving in the right direction: Eating out Spending on food service from both South Carolina residents and out-of-state visitors rose to $3.9 billion in 2015 from $2.8 billion in 2009, at the end of the Great Recession, according to the state Department of Parks and Recreation. Bobby Williams, chief executive of the local restaurant chain Lizard’s Thicket, said his stores have seen a 10 percent increase in sales since 2010. And he expects that momentum to continue. “We’re a good barometer about what is going on,” he said “If our business is good, everybody’s business is good.” Williams is president of the Columbia Restaurant Association, a division of the S.C. Restaurant and Lodging Association. He noted the large number of new restaurants that have opened in Columbia in recent years, particularly in the Vista, and said it was an indication an improving economy. “The Vista is booming and everybody is happy,” he said. Lizard’s Thicket has 14 locations around the Columbia area and one in Florence. The biggest growth in the franchise, he said, is in the Blythewood store. Williams said the company is beginning an aggressive refurbishing program for its stores this year, “and maybe expansion in the future.” Travel Like restaurants, hotels are riding the improving economic wave. People have more disposable income, and they feel more secure that their jobs are safe. So they are willing to take a vacation. S.C. Parks and Recreation statistics show spending on hotels in the state skyrocketed to nearly $3 billion in 2015 from $1.9 billion in 2009. “I think we’re going to continue to improve in terms of occupancy and rate per room,” said Andrew Lucas, general manager of The Inn at USC/Wyndam Garden Columbia. “We felt the bottom back in 2008. Since then people have started traveling again.” Adding to the rise in the economy are the growing travel habits of millennials, he said. “They are looking for new experiences,” said Lucas, who also is president of the Columbia Lodging Association, also a chapter of the S.C. Restaurant and Lodging Association. “They are willing to spend money on those experiences and not so much on things, possessions. That’s going to help drive our occupancy.” But tapping into that millennial vein will take a new type of marketing in a new economy: social media. “We’re going to have to be on our game because you can’t hide a bad experience anymore,” Lucas said. “One bad review will kill you.” Truck drivers Oddly enough, truck drivers – or the lack thereof – is a huge indicator of which way the economy is moving. As the economy improves, more freight must be moved and more jobs become available. As the economy worsens, the need to move product decreases, and more people are willing to sign on to drive despite the stresses of long distance hauls. Rick Todd, chief executive of the South Carolina Trucking Association, said freight companies are always looking for drivers. “But when the economy ticks up, the situation is exacerbated,” he said. “When there are slowdowns, it takes the pressure off.” The American Trucking Associations posted the shortage at about 20,000 nationally in 2011. But the group estimates that number could grow to nearly 100,000 by the end of this year. “When there is more competition for jobs, there are more people willing to drive,” Todd said. “When the economy improves and you increase freight demand, you need more drivers.” He added that millennials are turning a cold shoulder to the industry: Only one half of 1 percent of drivers 18 to 21 years of age have a commercial drivers license. Drivers 52 and older carry 45 percent of the commercial licenses, and they are nearing retirement. “We’re staring down the barrel of a gun,” Todd said. Shortage of workers Another shortage that could have even more lasting ramifications in South Carolina are high-skill manufacturing jobs. A University of South Carolina study shows jobs requiring a college degree, including from two-year and four-year programs, will jump from 61.5 percent in 2013 to 66.7 percent in 2030. A national study by the Deloitte Manufacturing Institute shows that over the next decade, nearly 3.5 million manufacturing jobs will likely have to be filled, resulting in 2 million of those jobs going vacant. For Gossett, of the S.C. Manufacturing Alliance, keeping up with that curve is vital to the state’s economic future. “It’s a bad situation right now,” he said. “The entire country is dealing with a skill shortage and we think it’s going to intensify. If a state wants to remain competitive, they are going to need to be on top of the workforce issue.” South Carolina might be more at risk than other states, he said, because it has a small population and some big-hitting, rapidly expanding manufacturers like Boeing and BMW – with more, like Volvo and DaimlerChrysler, on the way. But Gossett said he is confident the state, through its strong technical school system and private initiatives, can rise to the challenge. “We’ve always met the need and and we will continue to meet the need,” he said. Home remodeling versus purchasing When the economy was in the dumps, not only was it harder to qualify for a loan to purchase a house, but many people chose simply to remodel their existing homes in the face of financial uncertainty. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in South Carolina in 2016, annual employment growth for new construction was approximately 9 percent, compared to just 6 percent for remodeling construction. By contrast, in 2014, remodeling construction employment growth was approximately 5 percent new compared to just 3 percent for construction employment growth. “As the economy has improved, more people have become employed and have more disposable income,” said USC economist Joseph Von Nessen. “In addition, those that were already employed are more confident that they will remain employed for the foreseeable future. “This has resulted in a shift in consumer buying patterns towards the purchase of new homes and away from the remodeling of existing homes,” he said. Leisure spending in South Carolina The amount of money spent on dining, hotels, transportation and recreation in South Carolina is growing steadily. It’s an indication that the economy is on the mend. 2009 – $9.9 billion 2010 – $10.8 billion 2011 – $11.8 billion 2012 – $12.6 billion 2013 – $13 billion 2014 – $13.5 billion 2015 – $14 billion SOURCE: S.C.

The measure is part of the House GOP's corporate tax plan and would tax imports and exempt exports. "It will force consumers to pay as much as 20 percent more for the products they need. Gasoline is estimated to go up as much as 35 cents a gallon," said "Americans for Affordable Products" advisor Brian Dodge in an interview with "Power Lunch." "Common household goods, apparel, things that people count on every day, pajamas, will cost more and really just so a certain, select group of corporations can avoid paying taxes forever. We think that's bad policy," he added. Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images The coalition is made up of retailers like Wal-Mart, Macy's and Nike. However, other corporations in the U.S. are cheering the move. Names like General Electric, Boeing and Pfizer are members of the "American Made Coalition," which supports the border adjustment tax. Brian Reardon, an advisor to "American Made Coalition," told "Power Lunch" the Republicans' tax reform bill will keep jobs and money in the United States and the border adjustment tax is the "glue" that keeps the whole thing together. "The point is to ensure that when Americans are investing in the United States and creating products here that they are not at a tax disadvantage," he said. "The whole point … is to cut taxes so that we have more investment, more jobs, higher wages and at the end of the day, the consumer is going to be benefited, not hurt." In fact, the consumer will not be paying more for goods, he argued, pointing out that almost every country the U.S. competes with has this type of tax. "What we found when countries move to a border adjusted tax is that currencies adjust, markets work and the consumers are protected," said Reardon. However, Dodge called the notion that this type of border adjustment tax is common around the globe "grossly misleading." Instead of being a component of a corporate tax package, it is actually a proponent of a value-added tax — and that is different, he said. "The argument that currencies will adjust will be cold comfort and probably not fly with Middle American consumers who are concerned about having to pay more for products," he said. — CNBC's Gino Siniscalchi contributed to this report. show chapters AutoNation CEO: Tariffs and border tax talk causes 'headache' for auto industry    Friday, 3 Feb 2017 | 7:19 AM ET | 02:15 Michelle FoxProducer Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change WMT --- To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

U.S. President Donald Trump signed two executive orders on Jan. 25 to have the Department of Homeland Security begin planning, designing and building a "physical barrier" along the U.S.-Mexico border, identify undocumented immigrants, and remove those who have criminal records. (Xinhua/David de la Paz) by Huang Heng, ChenChen Shen EL CENTRO, the United States, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- "Trump's border wall? ... Well, I think it's just kidding," Brenda Gonzalez joked around with his customers. Originally from Mexico, Gonzalez is now a front desk manager at a Holiday Inn Express hotel in El Centro, California, 350 kilometers southeast to Los Angeles. "Tell Trump to offer me a job when he starts to build the wall," A Caucasian co-worker said to Gonzalez, while getting ready to start his shift at the front desk. Just a few months ago, this young man moved from Eastern Los Angeles to the largest city in the Imperial Valley, only 6.8 kilometers north of Calexico, a smaller town divided by fence with Mexicali, a Mexican city. This three-story Holiday Inn Express is a standing-out building in El Centro, owned by an immigrant from Eastern India. Ten years ago before this hotel first opened to business, local residents in El Centro thought motels were good enough for this city since only truck drivers would sleep over at town. But now, with the development of border trading, El Centro is growing and getting international, with chain restaurants and supermarkets. In Calexico, many of the shop owners are Korean. U.S. President Donald Trump signed two executive orders on Jan. 25 to have the Department of Homeland Security begin planning, designing and building a "physical barrier" along the U.S.-Mexico border, identify undocumented immigrants, and remove those who have criminal records. The cost of the wall to block off the nearly 3200 km-long border has been estimated to be anything from 8 to 25 billion U.S. dollars. However, for local residents living in the border cities, the wall is a ridiculous idea. "They won't build that wall, even if they did, nothing will change. There used to have those thin fences along the border, now they've replaced them with stronger metal fences. But people still come across the border to buy things or work. I do not think a wall will stop them." Vincent, a salesman at El Centro Walmart who only gave his first name, told Xinhua. The "ugly iron fences" he talked about are about 6 meters high and located in Calexico. Vincent, immigrated from Mexico years ago, believed that income difference was one of the major reasons for illegal immigrants to enter U.S. from Mexico. "They only make 4 dollars a day over there, but here, they make a few times more than that. One day here equals to one week there. Even if they get caught and sent back, they can come back later with Border Crossing Card," Vincent said. Border Crossing Card (BCC) allows Mexican citizens to visit the border areas of the United States when entering by land or sea directly from Mexico for less than 72 hours. "The only thing that will stop the flow of migrants is improved conditions in migrants' countries of origin: Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and other areas," Ev Meade, director of the University of San Diego's Trans-Border Institute told local KPBS radio last December. However, the reality was much more complicated than researchers' words. Vincent and all of the other local residents told Xinhua that, most of the Mexicans working in El Centro, including legal and illegal immigrants, did not really want to live in the U.S., they just want to make money in the U.S. and spend them in Mexico. Most of them go back to Mexico every week or even everyday. It is the U.S. employers that do not want them to leave. Not many locals can do or want to do the work that Mexicans are doing. Vincent said he had a part-time job repairing air-conditioners, only a few people in the agriculture-based Imperial Valley know how to do it. Statistics showed that "illegal immigrants" contributed a lot to American economy. A cross section of California leaders in business, education, law enforcement and religion testified at Supreme Court of the United States last year that a quarter of illegal immigrants in the U.S. lived in California, which accounted for 7 percent of the California population, meanwhile, over 34 percent of agriculture laborers, 22 percent of manufacturing laborers and 21 percent of construction workers were illegal immigrants. "The undocumented workforce alone made over 130 billion GDP for California last year, which was more than the entire respective GDPs of 19 other states." they said in a court brief. "If you build a 20-foot wall, they (illegal immigrants) will build a 21-foot ladder and they will try to get in," said Shawn Moran, vice-president of the National Border Patrol Council last November during an interview. Nevertheless, he also stated that fence or wall was, at least, a warning that would eliminate incentives for migrations to enter the country illegally. David FitzGerald, co-director of University of California San Diego's Center for Comparative Immigration Studies, pointed out that a tall wall would also make crossing border more dangerous, which may increase the death number. U.S. started to build the existing barrier since the 1990s. It is now over 700 miles (1,180 Kilometers) and about one-third of the total length of the land border. Since then, about 7,000 to 10,000 people died trying to enter the United States illegally. Immigration experts and human right groups also raised the question that if there was a wall where illegal immigrants could not pass, would they try to enter the US from the sea? If the answer is yes, then tragedies happening in Mediterranean now could happen here. "Why waste the money?" Leo Poldo, the manager at a local Italian restaurant called Marino, believed that Trump's wall plan was a "hoax" or a "political game." Trump is committed to renegotiating North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and if partners refuse conditions that give American workers a good deal then the president would give notice of the United States' intent to withdraw from NAFTA. For residents and people doing business in Imperial Valley, this threat, which could lead to a tax wall, bothered them more than the border wall. The border wall is more like a symbolic gesture. However, local businessmen said that the "tax wall" could bring down the local economy, and as a result more people would try to climb over that border wall. According to the Imperial County Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy, Mexico is California's highest ranking trading partner. Over 30 percent of the trading products come through the two land ports in Calexico. The total value of the trading products in 2013 was worth at 13.1 billion dollar. Border cities, such as El Centro and Calexico, thrived on international trading in last decade. Indian, Korean, and Chinese businessmen came to invest because of international trading. Moreover, Laborers living on the other side of the border had no strong willing to immigrate to the United States as they found a comfortable post in global economic chain. The Imperial Valley-Mexicali Binational Alliance held a seminar on this issue at CETYS University in Mexicali last Thursday. They reached conclusions that they had to talk to the U.S. And Mexican governments, to prepare for the worst time and to believe there would always be a way.    1 2 3 4 5 6 >>      1 2 3 4 5 6 >>   Xinhua Weibo Facebook Twitter Reddit Diigo Delicious Digg Linkedin MySpace Sina Weibo Kaixin Renren Q-zone Tencent Weibo Sohu Weibo NetEase Weibo Copyright © 2000 - 2016 XINHUANET.com All Rights Reserved.   Feature: Residents along U.S.-Mexico border shrug off Trump's wall plan                Xinhua Weibo Facebook Twitter Reddit Diigo Delicious Digg Linkedin MySpace Sina Weibo Kaixin Renren Q-zone Tencent Weibo Sohu Weibo NetEase Weibo   Source: Xinhua | 2017-02-07 06:07:25 | Editor: huaxia A migrant stands on a tree that he uses to sleep while he waits to cross the border, in the downtown of Tijuana, Mexico, on Feb. 6, 2017. U.S. President Donald Trump signed two executive orders on Jan. 25 to have the Department of Homeland Security begin planning, designing and building a "physical barrier" along the U.S.-Mexico border, identify undocumented immigrants, and remove those who have criminal records. (Xinhua/David de la Paz) by Huang Heng, ChenChen Shen EL CENTRO, the United States, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- "Trump's border wall? ... Well, I think it's just kidding," Brenda Gonzalez joked around with his customers. Originally from Mexico, Gonzalez is now a front desk manager at a Holiday Inn Express hotel in El Centro, California, 350 kilometers southeast to Los Angeles. "Tell Trump to offer me a job when he starts to build the wall," A Caucasian co-worker said to Gonzalez, while getting ready to start his shift at the front desk. Just a few months ago, this young man moved from Eastern Los Angeles to the largest city in the Imperial Valley, only 6.8 kilometers north of Calexico, a smaller town divided by fence with Mexicali, a Mexican city. This three-story Holiday Inn Express is a standing-out building in El Centro, owned by an immigrant from Eastern India. Ten years ago before this hotel first opened to business, local residents in El Centro thought motels were good enough for this city since only truck drivers would sleep over at town. But now, with the development of border trading, El Centro is growing and getting international, with chain restaurants and supermarkets. In Calexico, many of the shop owners are Korean. U.S. President Donald Trump signed two executive orders on Jan. 25 to have the Department of Homeland Security begin planning, designing and building a "physical barrier" along the U.S.-Mexico border, identify undocumented immigrants, and remove those who have criminal records.

That’s exactly the problem the new director of the Nashua Soup Kitchen & Shelter is trying to tackle. Michael Reinke took over at the nonprofit last month. He’s hoping to find ways to get meals out to people in the area who can't get to the soup kitchen itself. He spoke with NHPR’s Morning Edition. Listen Listening... / 4:38 Broadcast version How do you think the city is doing as whole in addressing the issue of food insecurity? Comparatively speaking, we’ve been doing really well. One of the fantastic things about the Nashua Soup Kitchen & Shelter is we do have a food pantry that’s serving as many as 100 families on any given day, or 500 families a week. That’s huge. We’re really getting out there. And we have a great relationship with our local grocery stores, whether it’s Hannaford, Target, Trader Joe’s, Walmart, or Whole Foods, we have a truck that’s going around and getting the surplus food that they can’t sell, bringing it here, and we’re able to give it away to families that are food insecure. So we have a good supply chain, we have a good process, we’re getting people food. Our problem is really a logistic problem. How do we get food into communities where people don’t have access to reliable transportation? Maybe they have some mobility issues. If you look at the different neighborhoods in Nashua, whether that’s French Hill, Crown Hill, or the Tree Streets, you’ll find convenience stores just about every other block. But if you go into that convenience store, they’re looking for things that have long shelf life. So they’re selling chips, they’re selling candy, they’re selling beer, cigarettes, and lottery tickets. If you want a yogurt, you’re going to have to look far and wide to get that yogurt. You’ve talked about wanting to bring the organization’s services out to people around the community instead of having to get to the soup kitchen. What kinds of changes do you have in mind? I’m thinking about how we develop partnerships; maybe it’s with that convenience store, maybe it’s with a church in the area, maybe it’s with some place that’s always open, maybe a fire station. If we were to partner with our supply chain to bring fresh produce to this area maybe to do pre-packaged meals and put it in one of those slide-top refrigerator freezers that you got ice cream out of when you were a kid, and locate that in the fire station, in the church, in the convenience store. A family could then come along who can’t make it all the way to Shaw’s or Hannaford or Market Basket, but right here in my neighborhood, there’s a place where I can make sure I get fresh fruits and vegetables, where I can purchase a prepared meal that’s healthy, low in sodium, low in sugar, and tastes good for myself and my family. That’s how we can increase access to good, healthy food and make sure the health problems that are related to not having enough to eat, we can bring those costs down, and make sure kids are healthy when they go to school. Just about everybody believes that kids should have enough food to eat. And if we call come together, I believe there are resources in our community to be able to solve this problem. How do you strike a balance with the shop owner, who needs to make a profit, in order to do this and offer you the space? And how do you offer the logistics on your end when it comes to more time and staff? It’s going to have to be a partnership. We can’t just do it on our own. We’re going to need to develop partnerships with people like Meals on Wheels, or like E86, which is an organization that’s trying to make sure kids have food to get through the weekend. So we need partnerships with organizations like those with the food pantries around town. It’s going to be hard for any one organization, it’s going to be hard for the Nashua Soup Kitchen & Shelter to be able to solve the big, hairy, audacious problem by ourselves. But I believe if we partner with these organizations, partner with the mayor; I mean, just about everybody believes that kids should have enough food to eat. And if we call come together, I believe there are resources in our community to be able to solve this problem. Do you have a model that you’ve seen elsewhere in the country that you’d want to replicate here? There’s an organization down in North Carolina called Food Runners that actually has a mobile truck, like a food truck, that will go out to different neighborhoods and will say any kind in the neighborhood can come out and get a meal tonight and maybe even take a meal home for tomorrow night. So maybe we want to take that model and bring a food truck to French Hill, Crown Hill, the Tree Streets, and other areas where we know there are kids who don’t have enough to eat…and kids know they can go there and make sure they’re going to have a meal for that evening.  Tags:  Poverty TweetShareGoogle+Email View the discussion thread.

The 25-year-old is caught on surveillance wearing same sweatshirt and aviator hat each time. After being caught on surveillance on six different days shoplifting from Walmart, police finally caught Malcolm Tate on Sunday afternoon.  Each of the six days Tate was in the store, he apparently had on the same sweatshirt and unique aviator hat as pictured above (taken from surveillance video). The 25-year-old La Crosse man had walked out of the south side La Crosse store with nearly $2,700 worth of items six different days (Jan. 16, Jan. 20, Jan. 25, Jan. 26, Jan. 31 and Feb. 5).  When security noticed him around 1 p.m. Sunday, they told police "numerous employees in the store (were) following Malcolm at this point," the report said. The big ticket item was a home theater system valued at $148. On more than one occasion, he walked out with multiple bottles of Ciroc liquor valued at $31.97.   The most he left the store with at any one time was $775.26 on Jan. 26. Oddly enough, he was caught Sunday with just $67.46 worth of items - the least amount of any of the six days he shoplifted. Tate is in jail now for retail theft with his bond set at $800.

In what it calls a “thought exercise,” researcher Baum & Associates LLC estimates most automakers would need to raise vehicle prices by thousands of dollars -- more than $17,000 per vehicle in Jaguar Land Rover’s case, which imports all its vehicles -- to recoup higher costs incurred by a proposed border-adjusted tax. Ford, with significant domestic manufacturing, would need to mull the smallest price hike among major automakers, at about $282 per vehicle, followed by General Motors Co. at $995, according to the report. The estimates aim to show the relative impact of the tax plan on each automaker, according to Alan Baum, the founder of West Bloomfield, Michigan-based Baum & Associates. Carmakers are unlikely to raise prices by more than a few thousand dollars per car and would also likely have to foot some of the higher tax burden. “The plan results in a net cost for automakers,” Baum said. “Each company will then make its own decisions on pricing in order to best compete and maximize its profits.” Volvo and VW vehicle prices would have to rise by about $7,600 and $6,800 on average, according to estimates by Baum & Associates, which advises suppliers. President Donald Trump is said to be warming to the border-adjusted tax after initially viewing it as too complicated. Popular Now Supply Chain & Logistics: Top 5 Warehouse Challenges and How to Overcome Them Small Firms Are Better Partners than Holding Companies EPI Report Claims US-China Trade Deficit Cost 3.4 Million Jobs The proposal to begin levying companies’ imports and domestic sales and make exports tax-exempt would completely overhaul the U.S. tax code. General Electric Co. and Boeing Co. are among U.S. manufacturers getting behind the idea, while Toyota Motor Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are among the corporate giants warning it will result in costlier products ranging from food and clothing to gasoline and auto parts. The Baum & Associates report accounts for imports of both finished vehicles and parts for domestic cars that are made overseas. The one automaker that may be able to keep prices steady would be Model S sedan maker Tesla. The proposed border tax may induce automakers to boost U.S. parts procurement and production from existing vehicle assembly plants, according to the report. Overseas automakers including Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.’s Subaru, Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Mazda Motor Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. may also consider expanding existing U.S. operations or building new capacity. Pure Importers “Pure importers” such as Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo parent company Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd., Mazda and Mitsubishi are most “in the crosshairs” of a border-tax regime due to their total reliance on imports for their U.S. sales, the report said. If the tax is put in place and the companies want to remain competitive, Jaguar Land Rover and Volvo "will need to ramp up U.S. parts sourcing and/or build plants here," the report said. "The border tax approach will otherwise consume all of their profits from selling vehicles here." Volvo is already moving in that direction, with plans to assemble S60 sedans at a new factory in South Carolina starting in late 2018. GM, Fiat Chrysler, Honda, Ford and Tesla each source more than 60% of their U.S. vehicle sales domestically, according to the report, with Ford at 82% and Tesla exclusively assembling vehicles in California. Hurting Neighbors If auto sales slow, the tax would create an incentive for automakers to keep U.S. plants running at the expense of those in Canada and Mexico. That could encourage Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to accelerate the conversion of factories in Michigan to build pickups there instead of Mexico, said Dan Luria, an economist at the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center in Ann Arbor and the lead author of the Baum & Associates report. Nissan Motor Co. might export more from Mexico to Latin American markets and less to the U.S. Volkswagen AG could build another U.S. assembly plant. Mazda and Mitsubishi, which rely entirely on imports to the U.S. market, may have to quit the U.S. market or pay other manufacturers to assemble their cars, Luria said. In its current form, the proposed border tax could lead to the production of up to 1 million additional vehicles in the U.S. and 50,000 more jobs at car and part assembly plants, Luria said. In a separate report out last week, Colin Langan, an analyst at UBS Securities LLC, said the proposed border tax could raise average prices in the U.S. by about 8%, or $2,500 per vehicle. That’s enough to reduce annual sales by about 2 million vehicles, he said. Langan said he expects a draft bill to be released in late February or early March. He pegged the chances of a border tax being enacted at less than 50%. The tax has a good chance of making its way through the House of Representatives but is “very unlikely” to pass in the Senate, Langan said.

By Ryan Beene and John Lippert, Bloomberg News As Washington mulls a tax on imports, an auto industry study suggests the policy would deliver the sharpest blow to Tata Motors Ltd.’s Jaguar Land Rover while giving a leg up to Tesla Inc. and Ford Motor Co. In what it calls a “thought exercise,” researcher Baum & Associates LLC estimates most automakers would need to raise vehicle prices by thousands of dollars — more than $17,000 per vehicle in Jaguar Land Rover’s case, which imports all its vehicles — to recoup higher costs incurred by a proposed border-adjusted tax. Ford, with significant domestic manufacturing, would need to mull the smallest price hike among major automakers, at about $282 per vehicle, followed by General Motors Co. at $995, according to the report. The estimates aim to show the relative impact of the tax plan on each automaker, according to Alan Baum, the founder of West Bloomfield, Mich.-based Baum & Associates. Carmakers are unlikely to raise prices by more than a few thousand dollars per car and would also likely have to foot some of the higher tax burden. “The plan results in a net cost for automakers,” Baum said by phone. “Each company will then make its own decisions on pricing in order to best compete and maximize its profits.” Volvo and VW vehicle prices would have to rise by about $7,600 and $6,800 on average, according to estimates by Baum & Associates, which advises suppliers. President Donald Trump is said to be warming to the border-adjusted tax after initially viewing it as too complicated. The proposal to begin levying companies’ imports and domestic sales and make exports tax-exempt would completely overhaul the U.S. tax code. General Electric Co. and Boeing Co. are among U.S. manufacturers getting behind the idea, while Toyota Motor Corp. and Walmart Stores Inc. are among the corporate giants warning it will result in costlier products ranging from food and clothing to gasoline and auto parts. The Baum & Associates report accounts for imports of both finished vehicles and parts for domestic cars that are made overseas. The one automaker that may be able to keep prices steady would be Model S sedan maker Tesla. The proposed border tax may induce automakers to boost U.S. parts procurement and production from existing vehicle assembly plants, according to the report. Overseas automakers including Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.’s Subaru, Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Mazda Motor Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. may also consider expanding existing U.S. operations or building new capacity. “Pure importers” such as Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo parent company Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd., Mazda and Mitsubishi are most “in the crosshairs” of a border-tax regime due to their total reliance on imports for their U.S. sales, the report said. If the tax is put in place and the companies want to remain competitive, Jaguar Land Rover and Volvo “will need to ramp up U.S. parts sourcing and/or build plants here,” the report said. “The border tax approach will otherwise consume all of their profits from selling vehicles here.” Volvo is already moving in that direction, with plans to assemble S60 sedans at a new factory in South Carolina starting in late 2018. GM, Fiat Chrysler, Honda, Ford and Tesla each source more than 60 percent of their U.S. vehicle sales domestically, according to the report, with Ford at 82 percent and Tesla exclusively assembling vehicles in California. If auto sales slow, the tax would create an incentive for automakers to keep U.S. plants running at the expense of those in Canada and Mexico. That could encourage Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to accelerate the conversion of factories in Michigan to build pickups there instead of Mexico, said Dan Luria, an economist at the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center in Ann Arbor and the lead author of the Baum & Associates report. Nissan Motor Co. might export more from Mexico to Latin American markets and less to the U.S. Volkswagen AG could build another U.S. assembly plant. Mazda and Mitsubishi, which rely entirely on imports to the U.S. market, may have to quit the U.S. market or pay other manufacturers to assemble their cars, Luria said. In its current form, the proposed border tax could lead to the production of up to 1 million additional vehicles in the U.S. and 50,000 more jobs at car and part assembly plants, Luria said. In a separate report Wednesday, Colin Langan, an analyst at UBS Securities LLC, said the proposed border tax could raise average prices in the U.S. by about 8 percent, or $2,500 per vehicle. That’s enough to reduce annual sales by about 2 million vehicles, he said. Langan said he expects a draft bill to be released in late February or early March. He pegged the chances of a border tax being enacted at less than 50 percent. The tax has a good chance of making its way through the House of Representatives but is “very unlikely” to pass in the Senate, Langan said.

How are current, outdated models holding retailers and e-commerce brands back ? How can we fully embrace the omnichannel retail environment? Here are some challenges that businesses face in the current climate — along with some potential solutions. Outdated distribution models Many businesses are operating on an outdated distribution model. Traditional distribution models aren’t always the best way to go for ecommerce businesses; they need a flexible model with seamless technological integration. Integration is important – it helps manage inventories accurately, ensuring high operational efficiency. The big ecommerce giants are waging a war for logistical supremacy. Amazon has recently invested in freight shipping – a move which shows Amazon’s ongoing fulfilment ambitions, whereas and WalMart has just scrapped its Prime rival program, opting for free shipping for a large proportion of its customers instead. Big companies with competitive distribution channels are able to compete for customers with increasingly attractive delivery programs. Global markets vs. domestic markets China is where everyone is looking right now. Recently, Alibaba CEO Jack Ma had talks with Trump about expanding into America; Chinese Alibaba is effectively a giant marketplace, with little involvement in distribution and fulfilment. This hands-off model leads to problems with branding and customer experience — something more traditional retailers often perfect. Ecommerce vendors entering the US markets from countries like China and India will put pressure on national brands who struggle to meet consumer demand cost-effectively. Rather than compete on price, brands will have to learn how compete on customer experience and brand consideration. Lack of process efficiency Sales are trumped by the new omnichannel hero — efficiency. Efficiency is all about seamless operations and a commitment to data analysis. Adding value to customers is all about refining retail processes. It’s important to focus on efficiency over volume — scalable business over results right here and now. Inefficiencies lead to stagnation and frustration. In B2B, merchants often struggle let go of legacy systems like paper purchase orders; we need to embrace automation in order to hold onto valued customers.  Not investing in the future now Ecommerce is an exciting place full of emerging technology. Brands who want to stand the test of time need to be prepared for the technologies impacting customer experience, marketing, operations etc. Huge improvements in machine learning mean that live chat functions are now replacing the traditional call centers. Robots are entering distribution, and VR is making waves in the fashion industry. Amazon is even looking into the possibility of flying warehouses — the challenges of retail are being tackled by increasingly innovative solutions. The technology of today is tomorrow’s tool – companies need to invest in new ways of doing things in readiness for the paradigm shift. Mobile commerce had been on the radar for a number of years, but some companies were still surprised by mobile, leading to a colossal loss of revenue and market share. Ethical consumer choices In the hectic world of automation and mass production, consumers are going back to more local, authentic brands who offer them a more genuine experience. So how can brands speak to consumers on these terms, whilst also managing a business on a huge scale? The key is to make sure that process automation doesn’t also lead to brand autopilot. Mission statements, values, corporate social responsibility, and working with ethical suppliers are going to become increasingly important in the ideological battle for the consumer. PR in a digital world Open forums like social media are a hotbed for misunderstandings and PR nightmares. Brands need to be careful about the messages that they put out there as consumers will react badly to something they see as being in bad taste. (Recent #DeleteUber fiasco case in point.) To avoid PR disasters, brands need to get out of the lab more and test things out on real people. User research and studies will help align brand messaging with what people want. (And staying clear of politics is probably a good idea). Going digital is expensive Not going digital is perhaps even more expensive. Upgrading the backend and frontend of a store is a huge endeavor, but it’s an investment into your company’s future as a brand. Digital isn’t just about selling online — it’s about having more data, selling smarter, and operating a multichannel retail hub. Omnichannel and multichannel selling is becoming the norm; it’s how businesses stay competitive. (The much-publicized Shopify store/Amazon integration shows how platforms are encouraging the multichannel seller trend).

Get the latest news from The Morning Call on the Amazon Echo ALERT Breaking News Legendary retailer Albert Boscov dies at 87 News Breaking News Bullet buyer pleads guilty in "random" Easton-Allentown killing spree NORTHAMPTON COUNTY/CONTRIBUTED Robert Jourdain Robert Jourdain (NORTHAMPTON COUNTY/CONTRIBUTED) Laurie Mason SchroederContact ReporterOf The Morning Call Bullet buyer pleads guilty in "random" Easton-Allentown killing spree An Easton man pleaded guilty Monday in Lehigh County Court to buying the bullets that his "psychopathic" friend used to murder three people during a one-night, random killing spree in 2015 in Allentown and Easton. As part of a plea deal, Robert A. Jourdain, 22, will serve at least 12 and up to 40 years for conspiracy to commit third-degree murder. Judge James T. Anthony will decide the maximum prison term when Jourdain is sentenced March 27. Jourdain did not testify during the plea hearing, but asked the judge numerous legal questions. First Assistant District Attorney Steven Luksa said the victims' families agreed with the plea deal. "There is a recognition that Mr. Jourdain is taking responsibility for his actions," Luksa said. The killings took place in the pre-dawn hours of July 5, 2015. Jourdain was riding in a car with Kareem Mitchell, 24, of Newark, N.J., and Todd West, 24, of Elizabeth, N.J. Jourdain admitted that he bought a box of bullets at the Walmart in Lower Nazareth Township for West, who paid for and requested the ammunition. Friends remember Kory Ketrow, Easton homicide victim Kory Ketrow lived with the Bader family for three years prior to his death on sunday. The family and friends talk about him fondly. Kory Ketrow lived with the Bader family for three years prior to his death on sunday. The family and friends talk about him fondly. See more videos Just after 3 a.m., West fatally shot Kory Ketrow, 22, of Easton, who was walking just steps away from his Lehigh Street home. West, who pleaded guilty in October to three counts of first-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison, told detectives that he killed Ketrow because the victim looked "tired." Moments later, West shot at a car at Third and Spring Garden streets in Easton, narrowly missing a man and woman inside. Police say the trio then drove on Route 22 to Allentown, where West shot Trevor Gray, 22, and Francine Ramos, 32, who were in a car at Sixth and Greenleaf streets. Ramos, the driver, was found dead in the vehicle. Gray, who tried to scramble over the hood to escape the bullets, died in the street. Police investigating Easton man's shooting death Matt Coughlin Authorities released no new details Monday about the investigation into the shooting death of an Easton man early Sunday in the West Ward. Easton police said Kory Ketrow, 22, was shot several times about 3:15 a.m. near his home on the 1100 block of Lehigh Street. Ketrow was rushed to a hospital,... Authorities released no new details Monday about the investigation into the shooting death of an Easton man early Sunday in the West Ward. Easton police said Kory Ketrow, 22, was shot several times about 3:15 a.m. near his home on the 1100 block of Lehigh Street. Ketrow was rushed to a hospital,... (Matt Coughlin) Evidence at that scene led police to the car the trio was using, which police say belonged to Mitchell's mother. Mitchell, who is accused of driving West to the killing scenes, is scheduled to stand trial later this year. West and Jourdain were arrested the next day, after allegedly robbing several people at knife point in Allentown. Mitchell turned himself in a few days later. Jourdain's attorney, Christopher M. Shipman, said his client did not know West was planning to kill, but acknowledges that he provided the ammunition that West used to take three lives. "He gave him the bullets, despite the fact that Todd West was mentally unstable and could best be described as psychopathic," Shipman said. Jourdain has been held in the Lehigh County Jail without bail since his arrest and will remain there while awaiting sentencing. lmason@mcall.com Twitter @LehighCourts 610-820-6506 Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, The Morning Call Homicide DA to seek death penalty against Todd West, alleged gunman in Allentown, Easton killings Breaking Popular Obits Biz Cycle Sports Video/Photos Classifieds Go Guide App 30°

Country pop singer Kelsea Ballerini, nominated this year for a Best New Artist Grammy, and country singer-songwriter, Brett Young, will also perform. The “You Look Good” world tour, presented by NABISCO, is comprised of 65 shows in six countries, according to a press release from the AMP. The group decided to tour together after taking last year to pursue solo projects, according to the AMP. “We knew after the time off that we wanted to get back out on the road in a big way,” group member Charles Kelley said in the press release. “We couldn’t be more ready to get back out there with the fans and hopefully make a few new ones too.” Lady Antebellum’s “You Look Good” single is in a way a departure musically from its previous songs, the group says. “We’ve always loved experimenting with different instruments and sounds in the studio, but we’ve never used horns before,” group member Dave Haywood said in the press release. “The energy they brought to this song is really fun and was validation for all three of us that it had to be our first single back.” The single is part of Lady Antebellum’s “Heart Break” album, which will be released on June 9. “We knew right away that we had to name this album after a track that is a play on the word ‘heartbreak,’” group member Hillary Scott said the press release. ”It’s all about those personal growths everyone goes through, and it was liberating to get back in the studio with Charles and Dave to intertwine those feelings into the recording process. … I feel like we’ve reemerged stronger than ever and I can’t wait to share more music.” Tickets for Lady Antebellum, Kelsea Ballerini and Brett Young will go on sale Feb. 10 at 10 a.m. Ticket prices range from $36 to $69.50 plus fees. On Aug. 5, doors will open at 6 p.m. and music will start at 7:30 pm. Tickets can be purchased in person at the Walton Arts Center box office in Fayetteville, by calling 479-443-5600 or by visiting www.amptickets.com. The Walmart AMP box office in Rogers is closed, according to the release. The performance is part of the AMP’s 2017 Cox Concert Series, which debuts April 22 with Blink-182. Train is set to play May 22, and Third Eye Blind is scheduled for July 12. Steve Miller Band with Peter Frampton will play July 18, and Tedeschi Trucks Band with the Wood Brothers and Hot Tuna will play July 25.   Comments comments Previous post DOT report highlights state of transportation industry Next post Walton Foundation donates $750K toward economic development in Delta Newsletter Sign up to get latest from TB&P in your inbox!

By Daniele Alcinii February 6, 2017 London-based sales house Dogwoof has acquired the UK distribution and international sales rights to Dan Sickles and Antonio Santini’s Sundance-winning doc Dina. Produced by Moxie Pictures and El Peligro, Dina captures the cadences and candid conversations of a relationship that re-examines the notion of love. The 101-minute doc charts the unconventional love story of Philadelphia-based Dina, an eccentric 49-year-old suburban woman, and her fiancée Scott, an early-morning Walmart greeter, as they move in together ahead of their impending wedding. The film was most recently awarded with the U.S. Documentary Grand Jury Prize at this year’s Sundance Film Festival. Dogwoof plans to introduce the film to foreign buyers at this year’s Berlinale and will also release the film later this year in the UK. The deal was negotiated by Dogwoof’s head of distribution Oli Harbottle with Submarine’s David Koh and Josh Braun on behalf of the filmmakers. Exec producers on the film include Impact Partners’ Dan Cogan and Jenny Raskin; Moxie’s Danny Levinson and Robert Fernandez; and Killer Pictures’ Stephanie Choate and Christine Vachon. Earlier this month, U.S. distributor The Orchard acquired the North American distribution rights to the film. “In Dina, Dan and Antonio have created a stunningly cinematic film, which lovingly charts the evolution of the innocent and candid romance of its central characters,” said Harbottle in a statement. “With the look and feel of a classic U.S. indie movie, it is a worthy winner of the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance and is destined to become a favorite with audiences everywhere.” TAGS:Antonio Santini, Dan Sickles, Dina, Dogwoof Top Stories Documentary Series explores Manson murders through grandson’s eyes By Meagan Kashty February 10, 2017 Documentary A+E, Snapchat team up on original content By Selina Chignall February 10, 2017 Documentary Emmerson, Hungate step down from Warner Bros.

Police accused Travis Bailey Littles, 34, and Antonio Anthony Watts, 28, of having five or more counterfeit items and with conspiracy to get property by false pretenses. Littles was also charged with trying to get Visa gift cards from a Dollar General by using phony $20s. Police said he had 55 of them when arrested. Watts was charged with successfully getting clothing, cheese and other items from Walmart and with having 31 phony $20s when the two were arrested in the 300 block of Brooks Street shortly before noon. Littles’ address was listed in an arrest order as 675 Classon Ave. in Brooklyn, but he told booking officers at the Wake County Detention Center that he lives at 418 Jones Dairy Road, just outside Wake Forest. Tax records show that house is owned by a woman who lives in Brooklyn. Watson lives at 80 E. 93rd St. in Brooklyn. A magistrate set bail at $150,000 for each man.

It was created to provide people with affordable transit between Madoc Township, Marmora and Lake, Madoc Village, Tweed, Stirling/Rawdon and Belleville. In July of 2014, the Network purchased a new 17-seat bus with a lift and seating for two handicapped passengers. One bus does the Marmora Stirling route the other does the Tweed, Thomasburg route to Belleville and back twice a day. The stops in Belleville include Loyalist College, the hospital and Walmart.

The wheels on the bus go round and round, all through the town! Written by Verna Hills, 1939 Madoc — Students from the JK and SK class at Madoc Public School, sang the popular children’s folksong “The Wheels on the Bus” to help celebrate the announced purchase of a new $84,000 17-seat bus for the Central Hastings Public Transit system. The ribbon cutting ceremony was held Feb. 2 at the offices of the Central Hastings Support Network (CHSN) which provides the service. Tony Long, chair of the Central Hastings Transit Partners group, and vice chair of the CHSN board, who led the official ceremony commented, “This is a very much needed service.” Sally Gale, executive director of the Network was there with board members and drivers. “It’s taken a full year of budgeting and working with the financials to allow this to happen,” she commented. Last fall Gale talked about meeting with MPP Jeff Leal in Peterborough, (minister responsible for small business and minister of agriculture, food and rural affairs) to ask for funding. “One of our best kept secrets is our transit,” she said, hoping then that their plans to acquire a new larger bus would become a reality. “With a 21 per cent increase in ridership over the past two years, it was essential to make the move to replace the eight-passenger van with more than 450,000 km on the clock,” she said. Ridership figures show that 5,000 passengers now use the service annually. Marmora and Lake Deputy Mayor Linda Bracken, also on hand for the ribbon cutting, said, “I know all the municipalities thank each and every one of you for all the hard work you do on your board.” It is that coming together of five municipalities that has made the transit system possible. “Without the agreement of all five municipalities; Stirling Rawdon, Marmora and Lake, Tweed, Madoc Township and Centre Hastings, we would not be able to apply for the gas tax,” explained Gale. “Marmora and Lake have kindly and generously agreed to be the sponsor for the transit so they apply on our behalf for that tax.” The annual budget to operate the transit system is $150,000 and that covers insurance, maintenance, gas and drivers. “Our liability insurance has virtually doubled because we’re taking on more passengers now,” noted Gale. “I am very excited to see our donors and funders stepping up to the plate to help us meet the needs of the people of Central Hastings as far as transportation is concerned,” she concluded. | (0) Comment Join The Conversation Sign Up Login Latest Local News News Marmora SnoFest dog sledding races cancelled Snapshot News QW man faces murder 'counseling' charge Snapshot News Under capacity schools pose financial problem for board, audience at public meeting hears Snapshot News More arrests in Roll Up Rim cup caper Snapshot The Hot List: Top 10 cottage rental locations in Ontario Sponsored content Most Read SEE MORE Opening 'Love Letters' Friday night in Actinolite Central Hastings OPP warns of financial scam, computer virus Belleville's a growing city, Canadian census and U-Haul report show Marmora SnoFest dog sledding races cancelled Quinte West launches active transportation plan, requests community’s input In Your Neighbourhood Today Get paid for completing energy-saving retrofits in your home You may have home renovations low on your list of spending priorities, partly due to prohibitive...

(AP) — Investigators say a customer who fatally shot a man suspected of stealing diapers from a Wal-Mart store in Florida also injured a second person. Orange County Sheriff’s Capt. Angelo Nieves tells local news outlets that three men left the store in Orlando with stolen items Saturday and were loading the merchandise into a vehicle when a store employee approached them. An armed customer heard the commotion and came to the employee’s aid. Hiring freeze: Some answers, some questions Nieves says the customer thought 19-year-old Arthur Adams was going for a gun and fired his weapon. Initially deputies thought the customer only shot Adams but later learned a juvenile girl sitting in the vehicle was hit in the leg. She fled the scene and went to a hospital hours later. A third suspect is still being sought.

Read the full chapter on upholding good governance here. The Trump policy towards Africa will not be clear for several months at least, if we are to judge by the time it has taken past administrations to put their teams in place and articulate their objectives. While it is apparent that the president-elect has had very little contact with the continent, the same was true for Presidents Clinton and Bush. Similarly, President Obama—who later emerged as a champion of African-U.S. private sector investment—did not develop a strategy for the continent until the end of his first term. So, what might lay ahead for Africa? One of the most interesting initiatives to appear in the transition is the formation of Trump’s President’s Strategic and Policy Forum. The purpose of this group is to provide the president with private sector expertise on creating jobs and accelerating economic growth. Author Witney Schneidman Nonresident Fellow - Global Economy and Development, Africa Growth Initiative Twitter WitneySchneid The group is made up of 16 CEOs and, notably, many lead companies that are active in Africa. They include: Blackstone, General Motors, Wal-Mart, Boeing, IBM, Ernst & Young, and GE. The forum’s first meeting is planned for February at the White House. Clearly, the focus of the forum will be on the private sector’s role in rebuilding America’s infrastructure, which Trump announced as a priority on election night. This goal has great relevance and potential for Africa. For instance, one proposal would be to create an economic subcommittee of the forum to look at infrastructure opportunities for American companies in Africa that would utilize American-made components. Enhancing the U.S. role in addressing Africa’s infrastructure deficit with American machinery and other products would increase U.S. exports to the region. In 2015, the export of U.S. goods to Africa was valued at $18 billion, which supports an estimated 121,000 jobs in the U.S., according to the Commerce Department. A strategy that incentivizes American companies in such a way that it increases U.S. exports and jobs to reduce Africa’s infrastructure deficit would contribute to a legacy in Africa for President-elect Trump on par with his predecessors, if not more so. To facilitate its work, an African subcommittee of the forum could coordinate its work with the President’s Advisory Committee on Doing Business in Africa (PAC-DBIA), which reports to the president through the secretary of commerce. Over the course of three meetings, the PAC-DBIA has made a number of recommendations related to enhancing the role of the United States in developing Africa’s infrastructure. These recommendations include creating a U.S.-Africa Infrastructure Center and prioritizing U.S. companies and products in building out Africa’s transportation, energy, and health infrastructure. The last three presidents have left positive legacies related to Africa. This includes President Clinton’s signing into law of the African Growth and Opportunity Act; President Bush’s support for the President’s Emergency Program for AIDS Relief and the Millennium Challenge Corporation; and Power Africa, the Young African Leaders Initiative, and the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit of the Obama administration. A strategy that incentivizes American companies in such a way that it increases U.S. exports and jobs to reduce Africa’s infrastructure deficit would contribute to a legacy in Africa for President-elect Trump on par with his predecessors, if not more so. To make this happen, African leaders should engage the Trump administration actively and with an open mind. They should also endeavor to point out ways in which a substantial infrastructure program could benefit Americans as much it would those on the African continent.

View FAQ or Contact Us close [x] Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Share LinkedIn Email (Photograph by Liam Mogan, Food Styling by Andrew Bullis) The complex where we lived until recently had only a single chute for waste. Several times a week, I would step into a pair of chewed up sneakers and make the 20-metre stroll to toss our garbage. As a family, we were diligent recyclers—cutting down boxes and bundling newspapers, which we still read—but we paid little attention to our kitchen waste. Bags filled with wrappers and plastic but also egg shells, old peppers and leftovers, were routinely pushed past the trap door and quickly forgotten. When we moved to a new home earlier this year, our waste became harder to ignore. It now sits right outside our back door, laid bare to see. Thinking about it makes my stomach churn. Not so much the moist slop of decaying food scraps, but the value and volume of the food we carelessly throw away. During one particularly bad stretch, my family threw out most of a carton of blueberries, a half rack of ribs, rice, baked potatoes and an unopened Costco-sized tray of chicken that had developed a pungent odor in our fridge when life interrupted our meal plans. That didn’t account for leftover scraps from our plates or the untouched dinner snubbed by an occasionally picky toddler who demanded cereal instead of roast chicken. I tallied it up: We tossed an estimated $40 worth of food in a week or so. Reading the wilting leaves in our green bin, I saw an opportunity to reduce our waste and lower our grocery bill. I’m the resident shopper and chef in the family, so it’s mostly down to me. During weekly runs to the grocery store, I rarely bother with a list. We mostly pick up the same items each week: chicken, a couple tins of diced tomatoes, broccoli, asparagus, green beans. Our basket is consistent to the point where I can often guess the total before it gets rung through—typically $115 a week. That adds up to about $6,000 a year, for our family of four. Apart from the sameness of our meals, this isn’t something we viewed a problem, until we tracked our waste and realized it was. In retrospect there have been too many occasions when the depths of our fridge decayed into a wasteland of half-used onions, liquefied cucumbers, petrified lemons and colourful penicillin colonies hiding half-eaten cheeses—all orphan ingredients from slapdash meals dreamed up on the fly. We are not alone. At the University of Guelph, assistant professor Kate Parizeau was part of a research team that conducted an audit of residential food waste in the summer of 2014. They cracked open green bins to uncover the rotten truth about how much food is being tossed: The average family generated 4.5 kg of food waste every week. Of that, roughly 2.3 kg were avoidable, while another 0.5 kg were considered to be possibly avoidable. “We were picking up green bins that had been outside for between one and seven days and some of the food still looked pretty edible,” she says. What’s equally shocking is the cost. According to research by Ralph Martin, the Loblaw Chair in Sustainable Food Production at the University of Guelph, that 4.5 kg of food is equal to about $28 every week or $1,465 a year. Given the average Canadian family of four spends roughly $140 a week on food that means about 20% of our grocery bills end up in the bin. It’s as much as many families spend annually on gas. “People are buying too much and not portioning well,” says Parizeau. “It adds up.” Of course, inflation and the weakening loonie have also conspired to drive up supermarket bills, as have unusual price fluctuations, such as the one we saw earlier this year when the price of a single head of cauliflower jetted to $8 a head. By the end of 2016, food price increases are projected to outstrip the general inflation rate, which is alarming given how much of monthly spending is earmarked for food. The University of Guelph’s Food Institute expects the average household will spend $8,631 yearly on food, including $2,416 on restaurants. That’s up $345 from 2015, which was up $325 from 2014. That means the average family is spending $700 more on food than they were two years ago. Meats and vegetables are leading the way, up 4% and 9% respectively, and are projected to rise another 2.5% to 4.5% this year. So even if you avoid exorbitant cauliflowers (as I do), it won’t make you less immune to bill creep. The avg household will spend $8,631 on food in 2016, up $700 since 2014 Tweet This That is not welcome news. According to a recent poll by Vancouver-based Angus Reid Institute, 57% of Canadians say it’s becoming more of a challenge to put food on the table. Moreover, Canadians are cutting back in any way they can. Almost three out of four Canadians say they’ve switched to lower-priced house brands, while 61% have cut back on meat and 42% have cut back on fruits and vegetables. But do you really have to sacrifice nutrition or the foods you enjoy to save a buck? I consulted a number of chefs, nutritionists and food experts and, over the course of six weeks, I experimented with the best advice they had to offer. My goal: to cut my $6,000 annual grocery bill by $1,500 or 25%, by reducing waste and shopping smarter. I refused to make any nutritional sacrifices whatsoever, and insisted on continuing to plate meals my family loves eating (because I don’t know about you but I’m not about to adopt a new habit if I don’t enjoy it). I found that with a bit of planning, not only can my family eat great for less, we can eat even better. 1. Run your kitchen like a restaurant While the average family wastes food like no tomorrow, a 2010 Canadian study found that well-run restaurants waste no more than 5%. I wanted to know what they are doing that I am not and set out to find someone who could appreciate the need to keep costs in check but still cook a kickass meal. My search led me to Suzanne Barr, the driving force behind Saturday Dinette, a modern 35-seat restaurant in Toronto’s trendy South Riverdale neighbourhood. For Barr, watching costs comes second only to the care she puts into prepping brunch favourites like mushroom stout ragu on toast with lavender ricotta. “Being a true mom-and-pop restaurant, we do everything ourselves here and we watch every penny that goes in and out,” she says from behind the counter. When Barr noticed that many plates were returning with an untouched buckwheat pancake during her highly touted weekend brunch service, she quickly dropped the serving size from three to two. “It’s almost like food coming out of our mouths and money coming out of our pockets,” she says of the uneaten food that ends up in the dish pit. Adjusting portion sizes is something that works as well at home as it does at the restaurant. Author and registered dietician Cara Rosenbloom suggests that parents serve their kids smaller portions, offering seconds if they’re still hungry. After all, few people would pack up food that’s been picked over by a toddler, but with the right portioning, leftovers can be saved for another day. Here’s another reason way restaurants keep their waste to a minimum: They use everything. “That’s how we really keep costs down, we use every part of the vegetable,” says Amanda Cohen, the Ottawa-born chef behind Dirt Candy, hailed by the New York Times as one of the most influential vegetarian restaurants in the United States. “We find uses for them even if they are going bad; we will pickle them or dehydrate them.” Barr operates the same way. When she gets her order of fennel she mixes it into her slaw, uses the fronds for fennel butter and incorporates the rest into three different cooking stocks she makes. “It’s about getting the most out of every single thing here,” she says. And if the foods can’t be incorporated on the plate right away, you still have options that don’t require dusting off your grandparent’s canning equipment. “Take a loaf of bread and turn it into bread crumbs,” suggests Barr. “Challenge yourself to make something you’ve never made before.” 2. Shop more often for less stuff Adjusting portion sizes and getting creative can help you use up stray ingredients, but it only gets you so far. Overbuying is the elephant in the refrigerator. This is a particular problem in North America where many of us take pride in our ability to snap up perceived deals by buying in bulk. All those four-litre buckets of ketchup and pickles, intended to save money, more often end up creating more waste. A 2010 University of Arizona study looked at shoppers who stocked up on food at low-priced retailers like Walmart and Costco and found that they rarely consider the cost of what they end up discarding. In one case a participant who bought salad greens at Costco for “$3.50 or something” ended up discarding a large portion, but still felt it was a better deal than buying a more reasonably-sized container of greens for $2.50. “The modern American tendency to shop infrequently is at odds with basic human abilities to predict future food consumption needs,” was the author’s conclusion. It comes down to knowing what you are able to consume, says Sylvain Charlebois, professor of business and economics at the University of Guelph. “We are bad inventory managers at home,” he says. “We live fast-paced lives and at times the food we buy and what happens at home gets the best of us.” Buying perishables in bulk makes the least sense since they’re the first things that get tossed when we realize we’re too tired to cook one night. But the issue goes beyond stockpiling foods that go off. A 2000 report out of the University of Illinois, aptly titled “Cabinet Castaways,” warned of the risk of products bought for a specific recipe or occasion that never arose. It suggests that as much as 15% of our non-perishable goods are never used and eventually get tossed after gathering dust in our pantries. Likewise, North Americans have grown accustomed to filling their fridges with so much stuff we struggle to find room for milk. I’m guilty of this. My freezer is packed with bags of ice-encrusted meats, some of which have been with us since we left the condo. Without even seeing my freezer, this frustrates Chef Barr. “What’s in there? Things in your freezer shouldn’t be there more than a month. If it’s there after a month are you really ever going to eat it?” Her rule: Open your freezer as often as you open your fridge and make sure things are coming out as often as they’re going in. Otherwise, “yeah, that freezer is going to continue to grow and grow.” The simplest way to fight the compulsion to stockpile food: Shop more often and for less stuff. Dirt Candy’s Amanda Cohen is a proponent of this idea. Until recently, Cohen operated out of an 18-seat restaurant where keeping costs in check was a matter of survival. “We bought our vegetables every single day. We never had leftovers at the end of the night. We always started fresh,” she says. “It really meant we were using what we were buying and that stuck with us at the new place.” “It’s better to shop 2x a week than shop once & have a whole fridge of food go bad”Tweet This She says that if you can’t predict more than a few days in advance, then chances are you’re buying food you have no intention of eating. “It’s better to shop twice a week than to shop once and have a whole fridge of food go bad,” says Cohen. “It’s OK to run out.” This sounded like a logistical nightmare to me. On my first attempt, I went halfway: We did our weekly shopping trip but only bought what we needed to get us through the weekend, and then replenished throughout the week. If we got stuck, I knew we had some meat in the freezer we could chip out from under the ice. To my surprise, the bill rang up to a mere $40. The additional mid-week trip, for fresh vegetables, only added another $10 or so. In terms of food costs we saved $65 off our weekly bill—granted I managed to avoid meat purchases, but that would only add $30 or so for the week, which still put us 20% below our typical bill. If figured that if we did this once or more a month, we’d shave nearly $1,000 a year from our supermarket spending. 3. Don’t sweat the seasonal stuff By the same token don’t feel compelled to spend extra on organic carrots. Amanda Cohen’s whole business is built on turning common vegetables into high art and she doesn’t. She happily admits she’s seasonal agnostic and has never gone out of the way to buy top-of-the-line fruits and vegetables. She prefers to work with the same produce most of us have in our home kitchens. Cohen feels consumers get too caught up in the notion of buying locally and in-season. While Cohen says it’s great to support local farmers, the reality is most of our food comes from other parts of the globe. “Oranges are always out of season in Canada,” she offers by way of an example, adding that there’s nothing wrong with that.  In a widely read New York Times column, she noted how little most grocery stores stock in the way of local foods. “The fact is, we live in a post-seasonal world,” she wrote. “The vast majority of our fruits and vegetables comes to us on trucks and planes from faraway farms, and everything is always in season somewhere. Make your peace with it.” Still I instinctively thought certain foods would be cheapest during the months they’re grown in abundance. After all, it’s when they are freshest and most plentiful. But a detailed study of the Canadian consumer price index, which measures changes in the prices Canadians experience for a fixed basket of goods, revealed otherwise. Going back over 20 years of data, I noticed some interesting patterns emerge. Citrus is cheapest during the first three months of the year, while apples are most expensive during August and September, just when they’re coming into season in Ontario. According to Kelly Ciceran, general manager with Ontario Apple Growers, that’s because demand actually outstrips supply during those months. The cheapest apples arrive in stores in January. “That’s when there are lots of promotions, both from us and our competition,” says Ciceran. “We typically sell more bagged apples at this time which can be less expensive than loose apples.” Food myth: produce is cheaper when it’s in-season. Apples are most expensive Aug. to Sept.Tweet This Meanwhile, you can save by buying oddly shaped fruit and vegetables at any time. Loblaws latched onto this idea last year when it launched its Naturally Imperfect line of produce, selling undersized, discoloured or misshaped onions, apples, carrots and mushrooms for up to 30% less than their runway-ready counterparts. Nutritionally and taste-wise there is no difference. 4. Work the freezer aisle You’ve probably heard the old adage that you should shop the periphery of the store, where you find most of the fresh and perishable products, and skip the middle aisles. Nutritionist after nutritionist I spoke with urged me to take a turn down the freezer aisle, for my wallet and my health. “There are studies that show these products are just as fresh,” says Rosenbloom. In some ways, they’re even better. “Often the frozen ones have a higher nutrient content,” she explains. Think about how most produce gets to the store in the first place. It’s had a long journey and nutrients and vitamins like vitamin C break down over time. A bunch of fresh spinach could have spent a week or more in transit. Frozen produce is typically flash frozen within six to 12 hours of being picked when it’s at its peak freshness, she says. Following Rosenberg’s advice, I picked up a two-kg bag of frozen broccoli from Costco for $10. A bit of math suggested it contained about 20 servings. And while I wondered what Chef Barr would say, I felt slightly better when, a few days later, I noticed a single stock of limp broccoli, enough for two servings, selling for $2 at my local supermarket. In this case, frozen offered a significant savings—$10 in this scenario—over buying fresh. Using the freezer aisle as a hedge when fresh produce costs are high, or to have on hand during weeks when you don’t know if you’ll have time to cook, will cut my food waste and ultimately help lower my grocery bill. But beware that not every frozen food item is always a deal. Breaking out the calculator, I learned that strawberries are almost always a better deal fresh. It’s only after they top $4.99 per pound that it pays to buy frozen. I’m confident that I made a wise decision with my bag of broccoli—so long as I don’t forget it’s there. It shouldn’t be a problem: It takes up half the space in my freezer. 5. Ignore best before dates Here’s an all too common ritual: You reach into your fridge and grab a yogurt, only to notice it was “best before” yesterday. So you toss it out. At the University of Guelph, associate professor Mike von Massow argues that our fixation on these dates is misplaced. The dates printed on packages are really “sell-by” dates, when the food is at peak freshness, he explains. The food is still good, just not ideal for sale. It really comes down to a judgment call, he says, noting we’re often too quick to dispose of leftovers. “If it’s cooked properly,” he says, “you are starting with a clean slate.” If it smells fine, probably is fine.  I find there’s a bit of a “yuck” factor with this advice. I still have nightmares of a teenage encounter with a commercial-sized vat of OJ well past its expiration date. As such, I view expiration dates the same way I’d approach a bomb ticking down: I don’t want them to be around when they go off. For the paranoid like me, sites like Stilltasty.com can tell you everything from how long you can keep that open jar of salsa (one month) and how long you can freeze maple syrup (indefinitely) to how long that tub of yogurt should last past its sell-by date (seven to 10 days, apparently). The key is to manage your stock wisely. That means employing proper food storage and resisting the urge to crack open a fresh tub of sour cream just because the other one has already been open a few days. 6. Cut the red meat (It’s too pricey anyway) The freezer aisle isn’t the only one consumers should hit; don’t forget the candy aisle, says Rosenbloom. Not because she wants to see consumers load up on jujubes, but because that’s where many grocers typically stock pulses—beans, lentils and seeds—which can be used to help bulk up dishes so you can use less meat. Beef in particular is one of the grocery groups that has risen the most in recent years—with the price of a sirloin steak rising by more than 15% since 2014, according to Statistics Canada. About two cups of cooked red lentils is all I can handle. Following Rosenbloom’s advice, I added a handful to a batch of sloppy joes, as well as to a meatloaf, and still had plenty of the cooked lentils leftover. I was pleased to see it stretched our ground beef by adding at least two extra meals, even if the recipe had room for improvement. (My sloppy joes look more like chili.) Each of those meals would have cost $1.73 per person in meat alone, but bulking up with lentils dropped the protein cost to $1.03—a 40% savings. I don’t think I could keep all of our meal prices down this much, but if I did we would save $700 a year. Not a bad return for a $6 bag of lentils. Tofu is another food that can put a serious dent into your grocery bill, and a great substitute for recipes that call for boneless chicken breast. “For $2.99 you can feed a family of four,” says Rosenbloom. Up for the challenge I decided to take her advice a step further by combining it with another piece of advice Barr gave me when I visited her at the diner. Barr’s tip? Whether it’s meat or vegetable, utilize an ingredient in a number of ways to get the most out of it. For instance, she has beets on her menu three times. “People would never guess that it’s used in so many dishes.” At home that meant adding bean curd to our menu for two straight days. As someone who eats meat three times a day, a meal of tofu sounded about as enticing as a plate of boiled brussels sprouts to a teen. But following some advice I cubed up some extra-firm tofu and tossed it into some caramelized butter in a sizzling frying pan. It took only minutes to throw together a simple stir fry, but it was surprisingly good and filling. A similar meal using chicken would have cost upwards of $9 in meat costs alone; this cost less than $3, and there was more than enough left over for lunch. Tofu Thursdays is now a meal we look forward to, and we used the leftover protein for a brown fried rice experiment the next day which resulted in another successful side dish. Meats add a lot of weight to a grocery bill. Even if you don’t want to explore vegetarian options, there are other things you can do to lower this portion of your bill. Consider buying bone-in, skin-on chicken, suggests Zannat Reza, a registered dietician and founder of the food consultancy Thrive360. You can always de-bone it at home or cook it as is, she says. With boneless, you’re paying extra for convenience. For similar reasons Reza suggests skipping lean or extra lean beef and draining the fat. “Sometimes it can be half the price,” she says. “Obviously if you are making a recipe where you can’t drain off the excess grease then go for the lean, but with a stir fry it’s no problem.” And just as with chicken, medium ground beef packs a ton of flavour. Just as there are thousands of ways to prepare a plate of spaghetti, there are many ways to reduce your grocery bill and trim your waste. But my goal was to disrupt my own routine to find where I was wasting money. It was a challenge, but not nearly as difficult as I feared. Integrating the tips collected from Chef Barr and others into my daily routine wasn’t overly tiresome and well worth the effort. By my calculations, they have the potential to save me as much as $1,500 over the course of the year. It’s true that few households will ever be as smoothly and efficiently run as a restaurant. I for one have no plans to make homemade stock from my chicken bones and vegetable ends. Those will always end up in my green bin. But even if you only adopt a few of these tricks at home or at the grocery store, you’ll start to notice modest savings. As Barr explains, it’s all about how you utilize the products when you first pick them up. She stresses that you have to be realistic with yourself: “Am I really going to use this or should I just buy a little less?” Who knows, you might save enough to justify grilling up a few extra rib-eyes this summer.

As a family of four with two kids (now age 13 and 12) our total grocery spend in 2013 was just over $10,000. Way too much I thought. So I actively pursued the ideas in this article, and a few more, and got our 2015 grocery bill down below $8,000. That’s $2,000 less at a time when food prices were shooting up. Two more ideas I followed was 1) shop at the low-end chains and 2) buy the house brands or (even better) those plain yellow package items. Reply ↓ Murray F. on May 8, 2016 at 6:18 pm Lots of great tips in this article. We spend $235 a month for 2 adults and 1 toddler with a $25 a month Stockpile budget. Groceries have always been a challenge for our budget so we started The Grocery Game Challenge back in 2012 on the blog where I’ve blogged and dissected grocery shopping in Canada and continue to do so weekly. Since then many fans have joined in to help lower their grocery budget. It’s amazing what you can do when you document your expenses, plan your shops, price-match, use flyer sales, coupon apps, understand SCOP and much more. It’s nice to keep this category of our budget under control. Reply ↓ canadianbudgetbinder on May 14, 2016 at 6:13 am this is amazing,,,, thank you for sharing this article,,,,,I have been trying ways to save money on my grocery bills, and slowly I have been buying frozen more and found the same flavor and texture as buying fresh,,,,,if you’re cooking with the frozen veggies, the meal was just as good as cooking from fresh,,,I found. I now use frozen turnip, fruits for my smoothies and deserts,,,I use frozen mushrooms and broccoli and cauliflower in my stir-fries now,,,,too bad tomatoes and lettuces doesn’t come frozen lol,,,,, Reply ↓ Jackie Blair on May 16, 2016 at 2:14 pm I can’t believe this is actually advice. I was shocked to read that nothing, absolutely NOTHING here is news worthy. It’s just common sense!, and in most part not really helpful!! Our grocery bill and budget for a family of 4 with 2 growing boys is less than 375/mo ($4500/yr). By the tone of the article, the writer is from the east coast, take it from someone who’s lived in both parts of the country and assimilated the best of both. Invest in a real freezer; purchase a deep freeze of 12 or more cubic feet. More advice: don’t buy at Costco, and stay away from of high end grocery stores, those bananas are the same at Loeb’s or Safeway and probably came from the same distribution warehouse. For our family of 4, we have on average $800-$1100 worth of FIFO frozen food, stored and ready to be thawed for a meal, which with a little planning, goes a long way, Stock up on meat and other frozen whole foods, like fruits & veggies when they ARE in season or on sale. Another item that might have been good to mention (maybe he did but I didn’t read much past point #1) was build from the ground up. Don’t use expensive pre-mixed pasta sauces, make your own with unsweetened crushed tomatoes and your own spices, and throw in finely grated carrot to add sweetness and cut down on acidity, both your health and gut will thank you. Make your own hamburgers, a dash or Worcestershire sauce, an egg, seasoning salt, pepper and quick oats or bread crumbs makes something a lot tastier than what you’ll buy at the store. Couple this with home-made French fries, coated with olive oil, paprika, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder and you’ve got a hearty and wholesome meal. Oh and go ahead make your own stock, it’s easier and much healthier than the store bought varieties, and its MSG free. You want to see a real change in your grocery bill, take the time to plan your meals, prepare what you can ahead of time, and actually take the time to cook. My parting words are: “Never shop on an empty stomach!”. Reply ↓ Giovanni on May 17, 2016 at 1:12 am Giovanni, can you show us the breakdown of your grocery bill per week or month? The author is in Toronto, where space can be tight in homes (deep freezer might not be possible for folks in big cities), and yes, it is from an East Coast city perspective (I suppose), I try to shop at the cheap supermarket chains with my wife, and avoid the pricey chains. We also try to shop for fruits and veggies from local independent fruits and veggie stores (more often than not, the Chinese independent ones across Toronto can be cheaper than the cheap supermarkets). Our avg weekly groceries ranges between $30-$50. Reply ↓ Sonny on May 22, 2016 at 12:33 am Great article. I will definitely look up the sites/articles mentioned. Giovanni you should read past point 1 before wasting your time and commenting. I stopped reading your comment after you admitted you didn’t read the article. What the point for you to comment disagreeing with the article if you didn’t even read it? Reply ↓ Diana on June 17, 2016 at 8:02 pm hi I live in Pt. Claire and recently retired. There are 2 grocery chaines that price adjust the competition, Walmart and Maxi. Before I retired we would check to see which grocer had the best specials that we usually purchased and buy everything there. Now we check all the flyers and usually go to Walmart. We’re saving $150-200 per week, without making any other changes suggested in this very informative article. I’ve read extensively re finances in retirement,yet never the ease of reducing the grocery bill Thanks for an easy to read article Kenny Reply ↓ kenny on June 28, 2016 at 10:35 pm I meant $150-200 per month Kenny Reply ↓ kenny on August 31, 2016 at 6:03 pm good article except for the fact that it is important to support our local farmers and their markets. This is money well spent that goes around many times in our own communities. It also supports our hairdressers, our local governments and innumerable people and keeps us connected. And most importantly it is better for a healthier environment. Please do not make saving a buck the highest good because it isn’t. I am shocked that at this time of common concern for the impact of humans on the environment that one could be so callus as to discourage buying locally. Re: Cohen feels consumers get too caught up in the notion of buying locally and in-season. Reply ↓ Dee on January 16, 2017 at 2:32 pm Learning how to cook from scratch saves money, reduces salt and other additives and isn’t that difficult if you know how. Reinstate food preparation classes in school. Reply ↓ Marci M on February 5, 2017 at 3:27 pm Leave a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The trend is called "Dusting." Police were called to Walmart on South Rutherford Boulevard in recent days where they met with a 23 year old man who was somewhat confused. The North Spring Street resident was found to be in the tree line next to the store when officers arrived. When officers made contact with the man, he was surrounded by cans of aerosol dusters. A police report noted, "I made contact with a subject surrounded by cans of dust cleaner who appeared to be under the influence." Police say the first thing the man asked for were more cans of spray dust cleaner "So he could take the pain away." The man advised that he had been outside for over 24 hours and had been inhaling or huffing about 30 cans of air duster. The 23 year old was transported to St. Thomas Rutherford Hospital and later released. Upon his release from the emergency room, he was taken to the local jail and charged with theft and the unlawful use of an inhalant. The man was booked under a $4,500 bond. What Happens when you inhale? When you inhale it, it fills up your lungs and keeps the good air with oxygen out. It decreases the oxygen to your brain, to your heart. A 2005 USA Today article stated, "The high from the gas paralyzes the user for several minutes and gives a feeling of euphoria. Both dusting and huffing can result in damage to the brain, lungs, heart, kidneys and liver, and can cause death."

In what it calls a “thought exercise,” researcher Baum & Associates LLC estimates most automakers would need to raise vehicle prices by thousands of dollars -- more than $17,000 per vehicle in Jaguar Land Rover’s case, which imports all its vehicles -- to recoup higher costs incurred by a proposed border-adjusted tax. Ford, with significant domestic manufacturing, would need to mull the smallest price hike among major automakers, at about $282 per vehicle, followed by General Motors Co. at $995, according to the report. The estimates aim to show the relative impact of the tax plan on each automaker, according to Alan Baum, the founder of West Bloomfield, Michigan-based Baum & Associates. Carmakers are unlikely to raise prices by more than a few thousand dollars per car and would also likely have to foot some of the higher tax burden. “The plan results in a net cost for automakers,” Baum said by phone. “Each company will then make its own decisions on pricing in order to best compete and maximize its profits.” Volvo and VW vehicle prices would have to rise by about $7,600 and $6,800 on average, according to estimates by Baum & Associates, which advises suppliers. President Donald Trump is said to be warming to the border-adjusted tax after initially viewing it as too complicated. The proposal to begin levying companies’ imports and domestic sales and make exports tax-exempt would completely overhaul the U.S. tax code. General Electric Co. and Boeing Co. are among U.S. manufacturers getting behind the idea, while Toyota Motor Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are among the corporate giants warning it will result in costlier products ranging from food and clothing to gasoline and auto parts. Read more: Ford Seen Reaping Edge Over Toyota With a U.S. Border Tax The Baum & Associates report accounts for imports of both finished vehicles and parts for domestic cars that are made overseas. The one automaker that may be able to keep prices steady would be Model S sedan maker Tesla. The proposed border tax may induce automakers to boost U.S. parts procurement and production from existing vehicle assembly plants, according to the report. Overseas automakers including Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.’s Subaru, Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Mazda Motor Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. may also consider expanding existing U.S. operations or building new capacity. Pure Importers “Pure importers” such as Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo parent company Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd., Mazda and Mitsubishi are most “in the crosshairs” of a border-tax regime due to their total reliance on imports for their U.S. sales, the report said. If the tax is put in place and the companies want to remain competitive, Jaguar Land Rover and Volvo "will need to ramp up U.S. parts sourcing and/or build plants here," the report said. "The border tax approach will otherwise consume all of their profits from selling vehicles here." Volvo is already moving in that direction, with plans to assemble S60 sedans at a new factory in South Carolina starting in late 2018. GM, Fiat Chrysler, Honda, Ford and Tesla each source more than 60 percent of their U.S. vehicle sales domestically, according to the report, with Ford at 82 percent and Tesla exclusively assembling vehicles in California. Hurting Neighbors The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up If auto sales slow, the tax would create an incentive for automakers to keep U.S. plants running at the expense of those in Canada and Mexico. That could encourage Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to accelerate the conversion of factories in Michigan to build pickups there instead of Mexico, said Dan Luria, an economist at the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center in Ann Arbor and the lead author of the Baum & Associates report. Nissan Motor Co. might export more from Mexico to Latin American markets and less to the U.S. Volkswagen AG could build another U.S. assembly plant. Mazda and Mitsubishi, which rely entirely on imports to the U.S. market, may have to quit the U.S. market or pay other manufacturers to assemble their cars, Luria said. In its current form, the proposed border tax could lead to the production of up to 1 million additional vehicles in the U.S. and 50,000 more jobs at car and part assembly plants, Luria said. In a separate report Wednesday, Colin Langan, an analyst at UBS Securities LLC, said the proposed border tax could raise average prices in the U.S. by about 8 percent, or $2,500 per vehicle. That’s enough to reduce annual sales by about 2 million vehicles, he said. Langan said he expects a draft bill to be released in late February or early March. He pegged the chances of a border tax being enacted at less than 50 percent. The tax has a good chance of making its way through the House of Representatives but is “very unlikely” to pass in the Senate, Langan said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

toggle menu Be The Boss Kids Edition She's the Boss Entertainment Love & Relationships Hair Fashion Health MN Business Parenting WATCH MORE WATCH MORE Meet Jasmine Lawrence, The Woman Who Founded Eden BodyWorks When She Was Just A Teenager February 6, 2017  |   By Ann Brown 0 Comments The beauty business is a beast. It’s filled with competitors and very hard to break into — that is unless you have a niche. Jasmine Lawrence, 25, found her niche by offering natural hair products through her company EDEN BodyWorks, and she’s being doing so since she was a teenager. With the help of a $2,000 loan from her parents, the then-teenager launched her company, EDEN BodyWorks and made over $1 million selling her products online. Lawrence suffered from a hair relaxer disaster at age 11, and it was then she vowed to find a solution to better hair care for natural hair. She started making products in her own home. Eventually, she came up with a product line that not only is sold at such major retailers as Wal-Mart, Sally Beauty Supply, Walgreens and Krogers but she caught the attention of Oprah Winfrey and appeared on “The Oprah Winfrey Show” in 2006. And just this year she was inducted into Forbes’ 2017 Class of 30 Under 30, not for her beauty business but for her industry expertise via the world of gaming. You see in addition to running her own business, the Georgia Tech grad and aspiring roboticist is also a project manager at Microsoft on the Xbox One team. MadameNoire had an early morning phone call with the busy entrepreneur about her career path. Here’s what she shared with us. MadameNoire (MN): Why did you decide to go into business for yourself at such a young age? Jasmine Lawrence (JL): When I was young, about 11 years old, I lost a lot of my hair due to a relaxer and this made me not want to use chemicals in my hair. It was a horrible experience for me because I grew up with a bunch of sisters and I had always been into my looks, doing beauty pageants. I was caught up in all of that. So I started to do research, mixing herbs and spices and natural ingredients that I could use on myself, my sisters, and my cousins. We couldn’t afford all the things that said they were natural, so I was trying to make them for myself. It wasn’t until I was 13 that it turned into a business. Instead of going to adventure camp, I went to business camp and got to spend two great weeks in NYC at NYU. We went through this business problem and I learned so much. We got to come up with an idea as we were given $50 to $100 to turn this idea into a business. This was so exciting for me. They took us to the wholesale district to buy what we needed. I spent the whole weekend putting my idea together. My idea was “Sweat and Style.” I glued glitter and rhinestone to headbands. I wanted to look amazing while working out. I felt really empowered by this whole experience and when I got home I started to share the hair products I had made with other people. MN: You were ahead of the curve; now natural haircare products are all over the place. How do you compete with the big beauty companies who have now added products for natural Black hair care? JL: The world has changed over the last 13 years since I started the company. When I started there was a smaller natural hair community, but I have been lucky. Since I started sort of with this movement, I have been able to grow with the community. Unlike the bigger companies, I have developed a close relationship with this community and I am able to address their needs with the products they really want, rather than just throwing products out on the market. Also, we started with the belief that the company wasn’t just here to sell products, we’re here to educate and empower woman about their natural hair. I want to teach you that scalp maintenance is important, to teach people on this natural journey, and show that we are on this journey together. We have also been able to partner with many organizations that empower women on various levels and this has allowed us to give back to the community in non-traditional ways. MN: You were interviewed by Oprah. How did that happen? JL: One of the producers on “The Oprah Winfrey Show” somehow got her hands on our product and had me on for a segment called “World’s Smartest Kids.” I was representing America since I was kind of living the American Dream. I was in high school at the time, in 2006. It was like the biggest thing for me ever! And in 2014 I did a follow-up interview on Oprah’s “Where Are They Now.” MN: You aren’t only running your own successful business, you are in grad school, and are now working at Microsoft. How do you juggle it all? JL: I have to admit my interests have diverged from beauty. Ever since  I was in middle school I wanted to build things, so I started studying construction in high school. But at the same time when I was in high school, this was an amazing growth period for Eden BodyWorks, and this was exactly when I was applying to engineering school. I went to Georgia Tech and spent three years working on robots. I love my work now at Microsoft, and I have a such a close connection to Eden BodyWorks. MN: Would you ever leave Eden BodyWorks behind? JL: It would be hard to give up, it has been so much of my life and the lives of our customers. It has shaped my life and it has been pretty cool to have my own business. Though it is a challenge to juggle both Microsoft and Eden BodyWorks, each allows me to develop different skills that have worked well together. But sometimes it is difficult to choose which has priority. For example, when I decided to go back to school, I didn’t know if I should get an MBA or follow a course of study that would help me at Microsoft. Luckily, I found “Human Centered Design & Engineering” (designing solutions to global challenges by tailoring technology to human needs and interests) at the University of Washington. I can this use for both. It has been amazing!

Comment & Opinion 6 Feb 2017 Here, Andrew Metcalfe, chief technology officer at Ve Interactive, discusses whether SMEs with big brand ambitions can survive without an online marketplace. COMMENT Two thirds of UK SME online retailers plan to increase trade through Etsy, Amazon, eBay, and other online marketplace sites to increase online sales Owen Gough The online marketplace has revolutionised how we shop online. They give people a single destination from which they have access to a myriad of brands and products – the concept is as old as time, of course, but instead of Harrods, Westfield and Walmart we’re talking about Amazon, Etsy, and eBay. The benefits of this all-in-one convenience are obvious for the customer but what of the retailers – especially those less established brands in the earlier stages of development? I certainly appreciate that for retailers in the midst of growth, marketplaces do have an appetising appeal. The online marketplace has the reach to attract new prospects and the logistical heft to handle transactions, leaving the vendor to supply the goods and manage distribution. This has certainly caught the eye of many online retailers with a slew of new research showing that many are rethinking their eCommerce strategies in response to the growing presence of an online marketplace. And with 39 per cent of the eCommerce market expected to be dominated by online marketplaces by 2020, this change of tact certainly looks a prudent move. Much like the TripAdvisor or Expedia dynamic in travel, the immediate opportunities to acquire, engage and convert customers online that these marketplaces can offer would be almost impossible for an aspirational brand to replicate. However, this access comes with a catch. Beware the online marketplace ceiling While there is the immediate (and fully reasonable) financial cost to these things, there is a bigger consequence to consider in the long run. A boost in immediate sales figures are always welcome, but building a brand that people recognise and will seek out time and time again, together with control on your margins is the key to longevity. Building a brand is dependent, especially in the early stages, on creating a memorable connection, something which is jeopardised by an over-reliance of online marketplaces. In terms of evoking sensations, cognitions and behavioural responses from customers towards your brand, online marketplaces dilute the experience, which is a reality that smaller retailers with big brand ambitions should be wary of. One other thing to be careful of is how valuable you really are to the marketplace. If Amazon’s Basics range can recreate your product once they see it is successful, where will you be then? The marketplace has full visibility into what is working on the market and has strength as a result. How to create a brand experience that makes a lasting impression To generate greater loyalty and brand recall from customers, it’s essential that retailers focus on driving direct sales as well as those gained through online marketplaces. This is achieved by first creating a premium brand experience i.e. attracting new and maintaining existing shoppers through highly-relevant marketing. The basis of which is built on knowing how your customer currently behaves and wants to behave on your site. Yet, from what I’ve seen, marketplaces offer little for those SME retailers looking to build a total brand experience, as they lack opportunities for these businesses to capture things like first-party data and act accordingly on it. First-party data is what you, as a business, collect from your own visitors and customers and is undoubtedly the most valuable because of its quality and the fact it comes at no extra cost. The data, which might include things like customers’ purchase or browsing history, provides key insights into the behaviours, interests, and actions demonstrated across a website. Leveraging this data deepens your understanding of existing customers, enabling you to serve them with personalised user experiences, content, recommendations, and services based on interests, locations and intent. In other words, it gives you the ability to create a unique experience for your e-commerce services, across websites, mobile, and social media channels. How can an ambitious retailer build a long-term relationship with a customer if they do not understand the journey they’ve taken, or indeed the touch-points where customers would like brands to engage them? If you know whether your customer likes a promo code each purchase, or is more interested in getting the expensive product to their door as easily as possible you can offer a honed experience for them. An online marketplace might help drive sales in the short term, but won’t help you get the data you need. Data in action A good example of what happens when a business collects and activates their data effectively is our client, Liberty of London. The luxury goods store wanted to reduce cart abandonment and bring more people back to the site. How did they do this? Through harnessing first-party data from their website, that fuelled an intelligent and personalised remarketing strategy. This led to a total revenue uplift of 352 per cent. Balance is key I certainly acknowledge that the impact online marketplaces have had on aspirational retailers is palpable. Greater efforts and pledges from the bigger players in eCommerce to up-skill and improve the digital literacy of the UK’s SMEs are also readily welcomed. The key here is balance. While there are certainly many upsides to the emergence of increasingly influential online marketplaces, for retailers with an eye on long-term success, they must have the confidence to retain a data-driven approach to direct sales.

Nathan Bomey , USA TODAY Part 1 Welcome to the Automation Revolution Share This Story 1,231 Tweet Share Share Pin Email Comment BALTIMORE — The patter of automated machinery fills the air inside wire-basket manufacturer Marlin Steel’s bustling factory in a rugged industrial section of this city. Maxi Cifarelli, 25, of Baltimore, peers through safety goggles at a flat screen, her left knee bent and heel resting on her chair. Two years after earning a fine arts degree from Towson University with a specialty in interdisciplinary object design, she now spends her work days working with a personality-free machine with a name to match: a computer numerical control, or CNC, router. With automation poised to sweep through the economy, some fear that it will kill more jobs than it creates. But Cifarelli’s experience is the opposite. She befriended automation, instead of fighting it, and she has a job because of it. “I haven’t named it,” she said, peering over at the robotic machinery. “I should name it.” Cifarelli is one of 33 employees at Marlin Steel, which has undergone a transformation. Employees used to make wire baskets by hand. Now automation has taken over. High-tech machines do most of the work — and the plant needs workers willing to adapt their skill sets to survive in a rapidly changing economy. Automation has allowed Marlin Steel to thrive, but across the country, workers feel threatened. Donald Trump catapulted into the White House by giving voice to those fears and promising to save American factories and jobs by rewriting trade deals, taxing imports and removing regulations.

(Photo: Jasper Colt, USA TODAY) Futurists have warned for years that automation will take your job. Now it's happening, albeit in pockets, at manufacturers, warehouses and even some labor-intensive white-collar professions. As the political debate rages over how to inject fresh energy into the American economy with Trump taking office, automation presents perhaps the greatest threat to the American economy. But it may also reflect its greatest opportunity if workers take the Cifarelli route and embrace robotics, artificial intelligence and automation. Either way, it’s poised to accelerate — and if not here, then in foreign countries that will reap the benefits while the American economy suffers a competitive disadvantage. About 49% of worker activities can be turned over to some sort of machine or robot, increasingly helped along by artificial-intelligence software, according to consultancy McKinsey. About 58% of CEOs plan to cut jobs over the next five years because of robotics, while 16% say they plan to hire more people because of robotics, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers survey. As artificial intelligence programs proliferate, automation won't be confined to the factory floor. Positions that involve a substantial amount of predictable work, such as data processing, could succumb to automated software and artificial intelligence. McKinsey counted more than 70 entire professions in which at least 90% of activities can be automated, ranging from mail clerks to ophthalmic lab technicians, tire-repairers, butchers, food preparers and bakers. But many Americans don’t think they need to adapt, with 80% saying their job definitely or probably will exist in its current form in 50 years, according to the Pew Research Center. “We often think about automation as applying to front-line, low-wage, low-skill activities and jobs — and what we’ve discovered is there are some activities that are high-wage, high-skill that are actually very susceptible to automation,” said Michael Chui, a McKinsey Global Institute partner in San Francisco who studies the issue. “Almost every job in the economy has a significant percentage of activities that can be automated." The professional service robot industry expects to sell a third more units from 2016 through 2019 — 333,200 in all — than it sold in the past 17 years, says the International Federation of Robotics. They could be used in place of professionals, whether it's medicine, agriculture, hospitality or even the supermarket down the street. Consider: —Restaurant workers. In fast-food, San Francisco-based Momentum Machines already makes a hamburger-flipping robot. Several chains are gradually introducing self-ordering stations. —Shelf stockers. In stores, San Francisco-based Bossa Nova Robotics has developed a robot that is checking shelf inventory in a test at Lowe’s, the home-improvement chain. —Journalists. Automated Insights has created a software suite called WordSmith that writes thousands of automated stories every month, including Minor League Baseball game accounts and earnings reports for the Associated Press, basketball game recaps for Yahoo! Sports and financial content for dozens of other clients. —Bookkeepers. Accountants — perceived as a steady 9-to-5 job with an average salary of $67,190 in 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics — are poised for a total makeover. About one in five people in the finance and insurance sector primarily perform data processing — and about 85% of that work can be automated, McKinsey estimates. Predictability “The basic gist of it is the more certainty your job entails the more likely is to be automated out,” said Mary (Missy) Cummings, a Duke University professor and director of the Humans and Autonomy Lab. In other words, the more predictable your daily routine is, the more likely your job is to go away. It’s already happening. Walmart announced plans in September to cut 7,000 bookkeeping and store accounting positions as it automates cash management and centralizes the process at its headquarters. In accounting, nimble firms will transition their focus to advising clients based on insights gleaned from automated data. Audits may go from an annual process to a continuous action. Software will increasingly handle the “high-volume, routine, non-judgmental” activities in real time, said Bill Brennan, audit transformation leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers. PwC is now hiring employees for its auditing business with backgrounds in science, technology and engineering. “We need those individuals to help us as we get into data analysis, analytics, data security, cloud computing. The future employee is going to have a combination of those skills,” Brennan said. Cifarelli knows. At Marlin Steel, her college-level education pays off in production work. Pecking periodically at a computer mouse, she delivers detailed instructions, programming the machine to carve small canyons in wood to hold wire that is later welded together with automated equipment to make precision wire baskets, accurate to within 2/1000ths of an inch. She's bonded with her CNC, which she has come to think of as a robot companion. “I need the robot to ensure consistency,” Cifarelli said. “Over the past year, I’ve become really accustomed to the sounds and the movements of it. I can really predict what’s gonna happen. We’re kind of a team.” For Marlin Steel, the problem was straightforward: Automate or die. In the early 2000s, factory workers at the 48-year-old company were forming the big metal baskets typically seen in bagel shops by hand-bending wire at a rate of 300 bends per hour in a grueling manual process. “They all had huge right arms,” Marlin Steel CEO and owner Drew Greenblatt said. CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Marlin Steel in Baltimore, Maryland, was able to stay in business by automating its processes to stay competitive when many other manufacturing jobs went overseas. Video by Jasper Colt, USA TODAY When emerging overseas competitors swooped in and undercut the company on labor costs, producing baskets for less than $6 each to Marlin’s $12, sales cratered. “Our entire business model blew up and we were hemorrhaging,” Greenblatt said. “China was exporting baskets into Manhattan for cheaper than I could buy the steel.” To fight back, the company purchased robotic wire-forming machines and other automated equipment to manufacture precision wire baskets and other metal products for customers that required a higher-quality product, such as Boeing, General Motors, Harley-Davidson and Disney. Because of automation, Marlin Steel nearly doubled its workforce over the last decade to 33 employees and boosted pay from minimum wage when Greenblatt acquired the company to at least $15 per hour today, with some employees making more than $30. “It’s only viable because my employees are like on steroids,” Greenblatt said. “All of a sudden they’re super productive and it’s because we’ve given them the tools — it’s robotics and automation. Thank God for robots. If it wasn’t for robots, these guys would be unemployed.” Foreign competition Marlin Steel may have been ahead of its time. Industrial robots have hit an inflection point — powered by cost reductions and technological improvements in visioning, sensing and gripping — and are poised to accelerate. Although they only perform 10% of tasks in manufacturing today, they will perform 25% by 2025, according to a study by Boston Consulting Group. A computerized puncher stamps pieces out of sheet metal at Marlin Steel in Baltimore, which has embraced automation to remain competitive against foreign manufacturers. (Photo: Jasper Colt, USA TODAY) In one tangible sign of increased automation, those technological improvements have ushered in the dawn of the “collaborative robot,” unleashing automation from protective cages and placing the machinery right next to humans, with sensors protecting the worker and ensuring efficiency. Barclays analysts estimate that global sales of so-called “cobots” will balloon from 4,100 units and $120 million in 2015 to 701,000 and $12 billion in 2025. And it's happening globally. China, for example, is not wasting any time. Amid all the political consternation over alleged currency manipulation and global trade advantages, China is expected to double its installation of industrial robots from 75,000 in 2015 to 150,000 in 2018, nearly four times the rate of North America, according to the International Federation of Robotics. Trump has repeatedly pledged to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., even suggesting that Apple’s iPhone could be made here and exhorting Apple CEO Tim Cook to do so. But that might not be possible without massive automation to make it cost-effective to manufacture in the U.S. Apple’s iPhone manufacturer, Foxconn, in fact, has already begun automating certain work that was previously done by hand. A Chinese government official told a Hong Kong newspaper in May that Foxconn had replaced 60,000 workers with robots at one factory there. And the company is receiving incentives north of Shanghai in the eastern-central Jiangsu Province to accelerate investments in robotics to replace human labor, according to Chinese state media organization Xinhua. As automation advances, globalization will enter a new chapter in which low-cost labor becomes increasingly irrelevant. Unlike humans, robots don’t get paid an hourly wage. So it’s not much more expensive to operate a machine in a developed economy than it is in the developing world. That could be good news for America because it may slow the outflow of investment to other countries. “The fastest growing robotics user in the world is China because they understand that they want a lot of this manufacturing based on low-cost labor, but that’s not the whole game,” said Jeff Burnstein, president of the Association for Advancing Automation. “The game now more than ever is quality, speed and flexibility — and low-cost labor alone is not gonna do it.” The downsides Automation is a double-edged sword, though. Take the example of family-owned Ramsey, Minn.-based injection molder Dynamic Group. The company recently boosted its production by 400% after installing robotic arms made by Universal Robots. Automation bolstered the company’s capability to produce lower-volume, highly complex products that would otherwise not be profitable because the company could not afford to hire workers to craft and manufacture devices with limited commercial appeal. “It’s really hard to be able to be competitive nation- and worldwide coming from this market and having to do that type of labor,” said Joe McGillivray, CEO of Dynamic Group, whose father co-founded the company in 1977. “We’re able to do more work, which will allow us to make more money and pay you better.” Still, the downsides of automation are impossible to ignore. As advanced manufacturing companies adopt more automation, many workers won’t be needed. Nathan Myers operates a two-dimensional bending machine that bends steel wire of various thicknesses into a specific radius for Marlin Steel in Baltimore. (Photo: Jasper Colt, USA TODAY) McGillivray said that by installing robots, Dynamic Group expects to reduce its reliance on temporary workers. In the past, the company had occasionally hired up to 20 temp workers to aid its permanent staff of 106 workers. “We would instead be using robots as our flex labor instead of people as our flex labor,” he said. Artificial intelligence If automation evokes imagery of robots replacing humans, then its close relative, artificial intelligence, conjures fears of computers taking dominion over humans. But those fears, while perhaps not unfounded in the distant future, fail to reflect AI’s emerging role as an assistant to people in the workplace. At Boston-based start-up Lola, two executives who were almost single-handedly responsible for replacing travel agents with computers — that is, one of automation’s most obvious examples of displacement — are reviving the travel agent through artificial intelligence. The 50-person company has developed an AI-based system — which basically just means a bunch of software algorithms — to aid human travel agents in making recommendations to travelers, booking accommodations and addressing itinerary hiccups. “We think most travelers would rather talk to a human because the human will understand them 100% of the time, so we use the bots to back them up,” said Lola CEO Paul English, who co-founded travel listings site Kayak.com and served as the company’s chief technology officer. “If we’re successful we’ll have thousands of travel agents, perhaps tens of thousands of travel agents working exclusively for Lola.” The AI, which English affectionately refers to as a bot, can crawl through a user’s email inbox, for example, to identify travel preferences and scheduling quirks. Those insights are translated into intelligence that the travel agents use to improve their customer's experience. For Lola Chairman Barney Harford, former CEO of travel booking site Orbitz and former executive at Expedia, it’s a sharp turn from his previous life ushering in the age of do-it-yourself travel. “We are bringing humans back into the picture,” Harford said. Part 2 How to make your job automation-proof For Canyon Gamble, robots aren’t the enemy — they’re a ticket to prosperity. The 19-year-old last year chose a decidedly high-tech career path, completing a special automation certification program at the tech center known in Marion, Ohio, simply as RAMTEC. It's already paying off. “I’ve had two or three job offers just in the past month,” he said, noting chances to work on computer-aided design (CAD) and 3D CAD. “I don’t need a college degree just because of how the field works. If you can prove you can do it, you most likely can get the job." At a time when automation is poised to eliminate entire professions across America, students like Gamble and some industry professionals are trying to outrun the revolution. For workers to survive with good jobs that are increasingly automated, it's worth considering the old adage: If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em. Or in this case, gain skills in programming, maintaining or fixing industrial robots or automated software. One strategy is to embrace a profession with little predictable work. Canyon Gamble of Marion, Ohio, reviews a three-dimensional gripper he developed for a Universal Robot arm through training at the Tri-Rivers Career Center’s Robotics & Advanced Manufacturing Technology Education Collaborative in his hometown. (Photo: KimAronson.com) A study by consultancy McKinsey found more than 70 professions in which no more than 10% of activities are susceptible to automation based on currently accessible technology. Those automation-proof jobs include posts such as special education teacher, transit police, tree trimmer, purchasing agent, multimedia artist and animator, psychiatrist, occupational health specialist, mathematician, music director, economist, astronomer and clergy. Adapting may be the only way to avoid tumbling into unemployment as automation sweeps workers out of entire fields. The good news: Automation technology jobs are lucrative. Careers in advanced manufacturing automation range in salary from $40,000 to $60,000 for high-school grads with certification from a center like RAMTEC and from $50,000 to $70,000 for associate degree grads from junior colleges with similar training, said Paul Aiello, director of certified education training for Japanese robotics maker Fanuc. By contrast, the national median compensation for Americans with only an associate's degree is $41,496, while the median compensation for someone with only a high school diploma is $35,256, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Not all of this critical training comes in classrooms. Some workers manage to figure it out on their own. Joshua Wallace, 33, a robotics technician at Marlin Steel in Baltimore, taught himself how to improve some of the company’s robotics systems by watching videos on YouTube. “If I run into a problem it’s amazing — just jump online. I jump on a forum,” says Wallace, an Army veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq. “Surprisingly there’s a couple things I just learned that would have really helped out months ago and a three-minute video shows me how to break it down and do it. I’m like, 'Oh my, it’s so simple.'” Another way to keep the automation revolution from swallowing your job is to devise a role that turns the tables on tech. Mari Vance did. Vance, 25, of Las Vegas, recently had her hours cut almost in half, from full-time to part-time, working as a parking booth attendant when the hotel-casino where she worked installed an automated ticketing booth. Needing more work, she left her job and struck out on her own. She decided to design a role-playing game for computers, raising more than $15,000 through crowd fundraising site Kickstarter to create a visual novel video game called Dragon Date, using self-taught skills. “I have a theory that 20 years from now we’re all going to be technicians and all the service jobs are going to be automated,” she said. "In the long term, I feel like creative jobs and stuff like that are the jobs that are most immune to automation." She's got a point. The pace of advanced robotics installation is expected to go from 2% to 3% annual growth today to 10% growth within a decade, according to Boston Consulting Group. Educators need to adjust the pace at which they revise their own programs. CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share RAMTEC is an Ohio technical center that offers high school students training in the field of robotics and advanced manufacturing technologies. That’s what happened at RAMTEC, which stands for Robotic Advanced Manufacturing Technical Education Collaborative. Chuck Speelman, superintendent of the Tri-Rivers Career Center, said the organization realized several years ago after a series of candid conversations with local manufacturers that its robotics program was not teaching marketable skills or using up-to-date equipment. “They pretty much told us that what we were doing was a waste of time,” he said. “We had to change the paradigm.” In partnership with robotics companies, local manufacturers and educators, Tri-Rivers Career Center designed a system that is now being replicated throughout the state. High school students enrolled for free at RAMTEC continue earning their traditional diplomas while also collecting skills that local businesses such as global automaker Honda, which has plants in Ohio, and robotics refurbishing firm Robot Works are demanding. Companies are pitching in. For example, Fanuc donated software training programs and sold cutting-edge robotics systems to RAMTEC at a steep discount. The company already trains about 8,000 to 9,000 people annually through its own network of paid courses, but is running at 99% capacity. “We can’t keep up,” Aiello said. “The only way to put a dent in the demand is to partner with education.” Follow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.

TARTA’s new Route 6 will operate in both directions around a dog-shaped loop touching Franklin Park Mall, the Central Avenue Meijer and Wal-Mart stores, the King Road Branch library, and ProMedica Flower Hospital, along with a spur serving Lourdes University and downtown Sylvania. It is planned to replace Route 2C, which also serves the mall, Lourdes, and downtown Sylvania but runs via Secor and Alexis roads on outbound trips and travels out Sylvania’s Erie Street to Centennial Terrace. Centennial Terrace will continue to be served by the Route 39/​39M express routes that run during the morning and afternoon rush hours, but bus riders wishing to go to or from that area midday or in the early evening will have to connect to one of the Sylvania Call-a-Ride buses once Route 6 replaces Route 2C. That change, the cancellation of two lightly used commuter express routes, and other service changes proposed to take effect March 19 are to be discussed during two hearings Feb. 15 at TARTA’s Toledo administrative offices and a third the next day at the Sylvania Branch Library. The Feb. 15 hearings will begin at 12:30 p.m. and 6 p.m. at 1127 W. Central Ave., Toledo. The Feb. 16 hearing will begin at 6 p.m. in the library at 6749 Monroe St., Sylvania. James Gee, the transit authority’s general manager, told the TARTA board of trustees Thursday the creation of Route 6 was based on heavy demand for travel to and from the library, the Kingston Residence nursing home, and the Kroger and Timberstone Center shopping area on Sylvania Avenue west of King. “This will help relieve the burden on the Call-a-Rides” while establishing direct service from Franklin Park Mall instead of requiring passengers to make reservations for, and connect with, the Sylvania Call-a-Ride in downtown Sylvania or along Central Avenue, Mr. Gee said. The new route is proposed to run roughly hourly — more often during rush hours — just as the Route 2C now does. Demand for bus service to the library “positively reflects the impact the library has made in that corner of Lucas County in the short amount of time the library has been open,” said Benjamin Malczewski, a Toledo-Lucas County Public Library spokesman. Scheduled bus service should be popular with library patrons, Mr. Malczewski said. The library also is working with the city of Sylvania, Sylvania Township, and the Sylvania schools on a project to add sidewalks to Sylvania Avenue for better pedestrian access from Southview High School. The routes to be canceled are the Route 7 Sylvania Township Express, which operates once each way, morning and afternoon, between the Central Avenue Meijer and downtown Toledo, and the Route 42 Miracle Mile Express, which runs once inbound in the morning and outbound in the afternoon. Mr. Gee said Sylvania Township commuters can be accommodated on the Route 20M Central Avenue bus, while Miracle Mile commuters can ride increased service on the Route 17 or Route 26 buses, all of which serve that park-and-ride lot. The Miracle Mile Express lost substantial ridership once the Ohio Department of Transportation closed the Berdan Avenue entrance to southbound I-75 last year as part of ongoing freeway reconstruction, the transit manager said. “The express route really became a non-express route,” he said, adding that the service could be reinstated once a rebuilt I-75 entrance at Willys Parkway opens. Cheaper gasoline prices also have hurt TARTA’s commuter routes in general, Mr. Gee said. “If [the price of] gas gets to the point it was a few years ago, we would certainly look at putting these services back on,” he said.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 February 2017 by Military News Trump Economic Council Excludes Small Business Leaders, ASBL Reports PETALUMA, Calif., Feb. 6, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ — Today Donald Trump introduced the members of his economic council with a conspicuous absence of anyone from the small business community. Having stated that he would be the „greatest jobs president God ever created,” and create 25 million new jobs, it’s curious the individuals on his business council are primarily from Fortune 500 firms and large corporations. Jack Welch, former chairman and CEO of General Electric, a corporation famous for its aggressive job outsourcing, is on the council as well as 16 other members from corporations such as Walmart, PepsiCo, General Motors, IBM, Boeing, Walt Disney Co. and Tesla Inc. „We’re bringing back jobs” Trump told the press before their first meeting. According to government data 98% of all U.S firms have less than 100 employees and they create 97% of all net new jobs. There are 28 million small businesses in America that are responsible for half of the GDP, half the private sector work force and 90% of U.S exporters. In 2006, a Kauffman foundation study found that 100% of the new jobs since 1988 have come from new businesses which are overwhelmingly small businesses. „If the purpose of the economic council is to try to increase corporate profits by shipping jobs overseas that’s definitely the right group to talk to,” said American Small Business League President Lloyd Chapman. „President Trump has promised to be the greatest Jobs producing president God ever created. Someone needs to show him the U.S Census bureau data that shows small businesses create 97% of all the net new jobs. I haven’t seen one economic policy put forth by the Trump administration that is specifically intended to benefit small businesses, and I don’t expect we will. I’m very disappointed that his economic committee should be 98% percent small business leaders and it’s just the opposite. It’s populated with people from fortune 500 firms and they don’t create jobs small businesses do.”   SOURCE American Small Business League CategoriesUncategorized TagsAdvocacy Group Opinion, Business, Federal Executive Branch & Agency, force, general, private, Small Business Services Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Introducing Echo App Developers: A New Company Ready To Bring Amazon Echo Ideas to Life in 2017 Next PostNext eBusiness Software Leader, Solidify Inc., Releases Latest Configure-Price-Quote (CPQ) Version for B2B Manufacturers Search our contacts Search for: Search Recent Posts Operation Food Search to Hold Fourth Purses for Pantries Fundraiser Operation Food Search to Hold Fourth Purses for Pantries Fundraiser Keller Williams Realty Memphis Announces Kiana Lee Keller Williams Realty Memphis Announces Kiana Lee Attendee List Released Ahead of RNA Therapeutics Industry Summit Featuring MHRA, Silence Therapeutics and GSK Business Contacts aBusiness contacts Proudly powered by WordPress

Nathan Bomey , USA TODAY Part 1 Welcome to the Automation Revolution Share This Story 1,231 Tweet Share Share Pin Email Comment BALTIMORE — The patter of automated machinery fills the air inside wire-basket manufacturer Marlin Steel’s bustling factory in a rugged industrial section of this city. Maxi Cifarelli, 25, of Baltimore, peers through safety goggles at a flat screen, her left knee bent and heel resting on her chair. Two years after earning a fine arts degree from Towson University with a specialty in interdisciplinary object design, she now spends her work days working with a personality-free machine with a name to match: a computer numerical control, or CNC, router. With automation poised to sweep through the economy, some fear that it will kill more jobs than it creates. But Cifarelli’s experience is the opposite. She befriended automation, instead of fighting it, and she has a job because of it. “I haven’t named it,” she said, peering over at the robotic machinery. “I should name it.” Cifarelli is one of 33 employees at Marlin Steel, which has undergone a transformation. Employees used to make wire baskets by hand. Now automation has taken over. High-tech machines do most of the work — and the plant needs workers willing to adapt their skill sets to survive in a rapidly changing economy. Automation has allowed Marlin Steel to thrive, but across the country, workers feel threatened. Donald Trump catapulted into the White House by giving voice to those fears and promising to save American factories and jobs by rewriting trade deals, taxing imports and removing regulations. A robotic arm removes a section of wire from a computerized two-dimensional bending machine before carrying it to an automated welder at Marlin Steel in Baltimore, which has embraced automation to remain competitive with foreign manufacturers. (Photo: Jasper Colt, USA TODAY) Futurists have warned for years that automation will take your job. Now it's happening, albeit in pockets, at manufacturers, warehouses and even some labor-intensive white-collar professions. As the political debate rages over how to inject fresh energy into the American economy with Trump taking office, automation presents perhaps the greatest threat to the American economy. But it may also reflect its greatest opportunity if workers take the Cifarelli route and embrace robotics, artificial intelligence and automation. Either way, it’s poised to accelerate — and if not here, then in foreign countries that will reap the benefits while the American economy suffers a competitive disadvantage. About 49% of worker activities can be turned over to some sort of machine or robot, increasingly helped along by artificial-intelligence software, according to consultancy McKinsey. About 58% of CEOs plan to cut jobs over the next five years because of robotics, while 16% say they plan to hire more people because of robotics, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers survey. As artificial intelligence programs proliferate, automation won't be confined to the factory floor. Positions that involve a substantial amount of predictable work, such as data processing, could succumb to automated software and artificial intelligence. McKinsey counted more than 70 entire professions in which at least 90% of activities can be automated, ranging from mail clerks to ophthalmic lab technicians, tire-repairers, butchers, food preparers and bakers. But many Americans don’t think they need to adapt, with 80% saying their job definitely or probably will exist in its current form in 50 years, according to the Pew Research Center. “We often think about automation as applying to front-line, low-wage, low-skill activities and jobs — and what we’ve discovered is there are some activities that are high-wage, high-skill that are actually very susceptible to automation,” said Michael Chui, a McKinsey Global Institute partner in San Francisco who studies the issue. “Almost every job in the economy has a significant percentage of activities that can be automated." The professional service robot industry expects to sell a third more units from 2016 through 2019 — 333,200 in all — than it sold in the past 17 years, says the International Federation of Robotics. They could be used in place of professionals, whether it's medicine, agriculture, hospitality or even the supermarket down the street. Consider: —Restaurant workers. In fast-food, San Francisco-based Momentum Machines already makes a hamburger-flipping robot. Several chains are gradually introducing self-ordering stations. —Shelf stockers. In stores, San Francisco-based Bossa Nova Robotics has developed a robot that is checking shelf inventory in a test at Lowe’s, the home-improvement chain. —Journalists. Automated Insights has created a software suite called WordSmith that writes thousands of automated stories every month, including Minor League Baseball game accounts and earnings reports for the Associated Press, basketball game recaps for Yahoo! Sports and financial content for dozens of other clients. —Bookkeepers. Accountants — perceived as a steady 9-to-5 job with an average salary of $67,190 in 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics — are poised for a total makeover. About one in five people in the finance and insurance sector primarily perform data processing — and about 85% of that work can be automated, McKinsey estimates. Predictability “The basic gist of it is the more certainty your job entails the more likely is to be automated out,” said Mary (Missy) Cummings, a Duke University professor and director of the Humans and Autonomy Lab. In other words, the more predictable your daily routine is, the more likely your job is to go away. It’s already happening. Walmart announced plans in September to cut 7,000 bookkeeping and store accounting positions as it automates cash management and centralizes the process at its headquarters. In accounting, nimble firms will transition their focus to advising clients based on insights gleaned from automated data. Audits may go from an annual process to a continuous action. Software will increasingly handle the “high-volume, routine, non-judgmental” activities in real time, said Bill Brennan, audit transformation leader for PricewaterhouseCoopers. PwC is now hiring employees for its auditing business with backgrounds in science, technology and engineering. “We need those individuals to help us as we get into data analysis, analytics, data security, cloud computing. The future employee is going to have a combination of those skills,” Brennan said. Cifarelli knows. At Marlin Steel, her college-level education pays off in production work. Pecking periodically at a computer mouse, she delivers detailed instructions, programming the machine to carve small canyons in wood to hold wire that is later welded together with automated equipment to make precision wire baskets, accurate to within 2/1000ths of an inch. She's bonded with her CNC, which she has come to think of as a robot companion. “I need the robot to ensure consistency,” Cifarelli said. “Over the past year, I’ve become really accustomed to the sounds and the movements of it. I can really predict what’s gonna happen. We’re kind of a team.” For Marlin Steel, the problem was straightforward: Automate or die. In the early 2000s, factory workers at the 48-year-old company were forming the big metal baskets typically seen in bagel shops by hand-bending wire at a rate of 300 bends per hour in a grueling manual process. “They all had huge right arms,” Marlin Steel CEO and owner Drew Greenblatt said. CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Marlin Steel in Baltimore, Maryland, was able to stay in business by automating its processes to stay competitive when many other manufacturing jobs went overseas. Video by Jasper Colt, USA TODAY When emerging overseas competitors swooped in and undercut the company on labor costs, producing baskets for less than $6 each to Marlin’s $12, sales cratered. “Our entire business model blew up and we were hemorrhaging,” Greenblatt said. “China was exporting baskets into Manhattan for cheaper than I could buy the steel.” To fight back, the company purchased robotic wire-forming machines and other automated equipment to manufacture precision wire baskets and other metal products for customers that required a higher-quality product, such as Boeing, General Motors, Harley-Davidson and Disney. Because of automation, Marlin Steel nearly doubled its workforce over the last decade to 33 employees and boosted pay from minimum wage when Greenblatt acquired the company to at least $15 per hour today, with some employees making more than $30. “It’s only viable because my employees are like on steroids,” Greenblatt said. “All of a sudden they’re super productive and it’s because we’ve given them the tools — it’s robotics and automation. Thank God for robots. If it wasn’t for robots, these guys would be unemployed.” Foreign competition Marlin Steel may have been ahead of its time. Industrial robots have hit an inflection point — powered by cost reductions and technological improvements in visioning, sensing and gripping — and are poised to accelerate. Although they only perform 10% of tasks in manufacturing today, they will perform 25% by 2025, according to a study by Boston Consulting Group. A computerized puncher stamps pieces out of sheet metal at Marlin Steel in Baltimore, which has embraced automation to remain competitive against foreign manufacturers. (Photo: Jasper Colt, USA TODAY) In one tangible sign of increased automation, those technological improvements have ushered in the dawn of the “collaborative robot,” unleashing automation from protective cages and placing the machinery right next to humans, with sensors protecting the worker and ensuring efficiency. Barclays analysts estimate that global sales of so-called “cobots” will balloon from 4,100 units and $120 million in 2015 to 701,000 and $12 billion in 2025. And it's happening globally. China, for example, is not wasting any time. Amid all the political consternation over alleged currency manipulation and global trade advantages, China is expected to double its installation of industrial robots from 75,000 in 2015 to 150,000 in 2018, nearly four times the rate of North America, according to the International Federation of Robotics. Trump has repeatedly pledged to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., even suggesting that Apple’s iPhone could be made here and exhorting Apple CEO Tim Cook to do so. But that might not be possible without massive automation to make it cost-effective to manufacture in the U.S. Apple’s iPhone manufacturer, Foxconn, in fact, has already begun automating certain work that was previously done by hand. A Chinese government official told a Hong Kong newspaper in May that Foxconn had replaced 60,000 workers with robots at one factory there. And the company is receiving incentives north of Shanghai in the eastern-central Jiangsu Province to accelerate investments in robotics to replace human labor, according to Chinese state media organization Xinhua. As automation advances, globalization will enter a new chapter in which low-cost labor becomes increasingly irrelevant. Unlike humans, robots don’t get paid an hourly wage. So it’s not much more expensive to operate a machine in a developed economy than it is in the developing world. That could be good news for America because it may slow the outflow of investment to other countries. “The fastest growing robotics user in the world is China because they understand that they want a lot of this manufacturing based on low-cost labor, but that’s not the whole game,” said Jeff Burnstein, president of the Association for Advancing Automation. “The game now more than ever is quality, speed and flexibility — and low-cost labor alone is not gonna do it.” The downsides Automation is a double-edged sword, though. Take the example of family-owned Ramsey, Minn.-based injection molder Dynamic Group. The company recently boosted its production by 400% after installing robotic arms made by Universal Robots. Automation bolstered the company’s capability to produce lower-volume, highly complex products that would otherwise not be profitable because the company could not afford to hire workers to craft and manufacture devices with limited commercial appeal. “It’s really hard to be able to be competitive nation- and worldwide coming from this market and having to do that type of labor,” said Joe McGillivray, CEO of Dynamic Group, whose father co-founded the company in 1977. “We’re able to do more work, which will allow us to make more money and pay you better.” Still, the downsides of automation are impossible to ignore. As advanced manufacturing companies adopt more automation, many workers won’t be needed. Nathan Myers operates a two-dimensional bending machine that bends steel wire of various thicknesses into a specific radius for Marlin Steel in Baltimore. (Photo: Jasper Colt, USA TODAY) McGillivray said that by installing robots, Dynamic Group expects to reduce its reliance on temporary workers. In the past, the company had occasionally hired up to 20 temp workers to aid its permanent staff of 106 workers. “We would instead be using robots as our flex labor instead of people as our flex labor,” he said. Artificial intelligence If automation evokes imagery of robots replacing humans, then its close relative, artificial intelligence, conjures fears of computers taking dominion over humans. But those fears, while perhaps not unfounded in the distant future, fail to reflect AI’s emerging role as an assistant to people in the workplace. At Boston-based start-up Lola, two executives who were almost single-handedly responsible for replacing travel agents with computers — that is, one of automation’s most obvious examples of displacement — are reviving the travel agent through artificial intelligence. The 50-person company has developed an AI-based system — which basically just means a bunch of software algorithms — to aid human travel agents in making recommendations to travelers, booking accommodations and addressing itinerary hiccups. “We think most travelers would rather talk to a human because the human will understand them 100% of the time, so we use the bots to back them up,” said Lola CEO Paul English, who co-founded travel listings site Kayak.com and served as the company’s chief technology officer. “If we’re successful we’ll have thousands of travel agents, perhaps tens of thousands of travel agents working exclusively for Lola.” The AI, which English affectionately refers to as a bot, can crawl through a user’s email inbox, for example, to identify travel preferences and scheduling quirks. Those insights are translated into intelligence that the travel agents use to improve their customer's experience. For Lola Chairman Barney Harford, former CEO of travel booking site Orbitz and former executive at Expedia, it’s a sharp turn from his previous life ushering in the age of do-it-yourself travel. “We are bringing humans back into the picture,” Harford said. Part 2 How to make your job automation-proof For Canyon Gamble, robots aren’t the enemy — they’re a ticket to prosperity. The 19-year-old last year chose a decidedly high-tech career path, completing a special automation certification program at the tech center known in Marion, Ohio, simply as RAMTEC. It's already paying off. “I’ve had two or three job offers just in the past month,” he said, noting chances to work on computer-aided design (CAD) and 3D CAD. “I don’t need a college degree just because of how the field works. If you can prove you can do it, you most likely can get the job." At a time when automation is poised to eliminate entire professions across America, students like Gamble and some industry professionals are trying to outrun the revolution. For workers to survive with good jobs that are increasingly automated, it's worth considering the old adage: If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em. Or in this case, gain skills in programming, maintaining or fixing industrial robots or automated software. One strategy is to embrace a profession with little predictable work. Canyon Gamble of Marion, Ohio, reviews a three-dimensional gripper he developed for a Universal Robot arm through training at the Tri-Rivers Career Center’s Robotics & Advanced Manufacturing Technology Education Collaborative in his hometown. (Photo: KimAronson.com) A study by consultancy McKinsey found more than 70 professions in which no more than 10% of activities are susceptible to automation based on currently accessible technology. Those automation-proof jobs include posts such as special education teacher, transit police, tree trimmer, purchasing agent, multimedia artist and animator, psychiatrist, occupational health specialist, mathematician, music director, economist, astronomer and clergy. Adapting may be the only way to avoid tumbling into unemployment as automation sweeps workers out of entire fields. The good news: Automation technology jobs are lucrative. Careers in advanced manufacturing automation range in salary from $40,000 to $60,000 for high-school grads with certification from a center like RAMTEC and from $50,000 to $70,000 for associate degree grads from junior colleges with similar training, said Paul Aiello, director of certified education training for Japanese robotics maker Fanuc. By contrast, the national median compensation for Americans with only an associate's degree is $41,496, while the median compensation for someone with only a high school diploma is $35,256, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Not all of this critical training comes in classrooms. Some workers manage to figure it out on their own. Joshua Wallace, 33, a robotics technician at Marlin Steel in Baltimore, taught himself how to improve some of the company’s robotics systems by watching videos on YouTube. “If I run into a problem it’s amazing — just jump online. I jump on a forum,” says Wallace, an Army veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq. “Surprisingly there’s a couple things I just learned that would have really helped out months ago and a three-minute video shows me how to break it down and do it. I’m like, 'Oh my, it’s so simple.'” Another way to keep the automation revolution from swallowing your job is to devise a role that turns the tables on tech. Mari Vance did. Vance, 25, of Las Vegas, recently had her hours cut almost in half, from full-time to part-time, working as a parking booth attendant when the hotel-casino where she worked installed an automated ticketing booth. Needing more work, she left her job and struck out on her own. She decided to design a role-playing game for computers, raising more than $15,000 through crowd fundraising site Kickstarter to create a visual novel video game called Dragon Date, using self-taught skills. “I have a theory that 20 years from now we’re all going to be technicians and all the service jobs are going to be automated,” she said. "In the long term, I feel like creative jobs and stuff like that are the jobs that are most immune to automation." She's got a point. The pace of advanced robotics installation is expected to go from 2% to 3% annual growth today to 10% growth within a decade, according to Boston Consulting Group. Educators need to adjust the pace at which they revise their own programs. CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share RAMTEC is an Ohio technical center that offers high school students training in the field of robotics and advanced manufacturing technologies. That’s what happened at RAMTEC, which stands for Robotic Advanced Manufacturing Technical Education Collaborative. Chuck Speelman, superintendent of the Tri-Rivers Career Center, said the organization realized several years ago after a series of candid conversations with local manufacturers that its robotics program was not teaching marketable skills or using up-to-date equipment. “They pretty much told us that what we were doing was a waste of time,” he said. “We had to change the paradigm.” In partnership with robotics companies, local manufacturers and educators, Tri-Rivers Career Center designed a system that is now being replicated throughout the state. High school students enrolled for free at RAMTEC continue earning their traditional diplomas while also collecting skills that local businesses such as global automaker Honda, which has plants in Ohio, and robotics refurbishing firm Robot Works are demanding. Companies are pitching in. For example, Fanuc donated software training programs and sold cutting-edge robotics systems to RAMTEC at a steep discount. The company already trains about 8,000 to 9,000 people annually through its own network of paid courses, but is running at 99% capacity. “We can’t keep up,” Aiello said. “The only way to put a dent in the demand is to partner with education.” Follow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.

While Miranda Lambert’s confession about her alleged problem with alcohol sounded like a joke, fans are concerned that there may be a little truth behind the joke. The same day before embarking on her “Highway Vagabond” tour, which kicked off on January 24, Lambert reportedly confessed while performing at an intimate show at Joe’s Bar in Chicago that she “started drinking a little extra.” Miranda Lambert also revealed what inspired her track “Ugly Lights” from her 2016’s studio album The Weight of These Wings. “Anyways, I found myself in Midtown in Nashville three nights in a row at like last call and with the lights coming on, and I’m still sitting there.” I laughed I cried, thank you for makin me feel everything in the world 2nite???? @mirandalambert #highwayvagabondtour pic.twitter.com/LLPdKe30UY — Danielle Barberi (@dani_b208) February 5, 2017 And Miranda Lambert, who is currently dating musician Anderson East, thought it would be a good idea to write a song about it, which is how “Ugly Lights” was born. Lambert and Shelton went public with their split in July 2015 after nearly four years of marriage. In fact, Miranda Lambert has even previously revealed that her headline-making divorce from Shelton inspired her latest LP. In her interview with Billboard, Lambert confessed that no matter how old she is, every song she has ever written was “a reflection of where I am right then in my life.” Miranda Lambert decided to “journal” her life, both her good and bad days, through her music. The country singer also revealed that has always been “pretty straightforward” in her music. “With my songwriting, it’s taking a journey with what’s been going on in my everyday life — good, bad, ugly and everything in between.” Wow, what a show! @mirandalambert you are amazing, and you ROCK! #girlpower #catpower #catcountry pic.twitter.com/zJDAvmJYis — Jake The Cat (@JakeTheCat981) February 3, 2017 Miranda Lambert, whose “Highway Vagabond” tour’s American leg is going to conclude in August before she heads to Europe, added that putting in her art “something really honest” has always been “the right thing to do.” Miranda Lambert’s net worth may be currently standing at $40 million, but when she needs to pick up products for her everyday life, she goes to Walmart, according to Rare Country. The 33-year-old singer admitted that she recently went on a Walmart run and confessed that she loves discounts! Well, who doesn’t? In her recent radio interview, Miranda Lambert revealed she’s regularly shopping at the discount retailer. “I go there all the time. I go to Target every weekend. Last weekend I went to the Walmart in Dickson because I have a farm out in the country.” But Miranda Lambert apparently doesn’t love everything about Walmart as she once stumbled across her own CD Crazy Ex-Girlfriend in the bargain bin there. And finding her 2007 album there “upset” her, the country singer confessed. Miranda Lambert added that she was with her boyfriend East, who tried to comfort the country singer by saying, “Hey, at least you are on sale.” Even though she is an internationally famous country singer, Lambert has always been humble and honest about her everyday life. Well I didn’t find any @mirandalambert in the Walmart Bargain Bin, but I did find plenty of BS! pic.twitter.com/MwFdMMs0ZO — No_BS_Here (@sweetxt) February 5, 2017 Take her revelation/joke about the drinking problem, for example. While most celebrities would try to hide it in the deepest corners of their dark secrets, Lambert didn’t shy away from talking about it.

Vegan. Think. Eat. Thrive.™ News Food Planet Travel Buzz Lamb Slaughterhouse Investigation Exposes Cruelty By Anna Starostinetskaya | February 6, 2017 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Animal-rights group Compassion Over Killing captures the first lamb slaughterhouse footage at Walmart and Kroger supplier, and it's as cruel as expected. Last week, animal-rights organization Compassion Over Killing released the first ever undercover footage captured at a lamb slaughterhouse in the United States. The hidden-camera footage was captured at California-based Superior Farms, the largest producer of lamb in the country, and supplier to mega-chains Walmart and Kroger. The video captured workers ineffectively slashing lambs’ throats and cutting off their tails while they were still conscious, amongst other egregious abuses that former USDA chief veterinary meat inspector Lester Castro Friedlander classified as violations of the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act. COK also documented workers failing to send meat through metal detectors (as mandated by company policy) and altering “best by” dates on packaged products—actions that raise health concerns for human consumption. “As we captured on camera inside Superior Farms,” COK’s executive director Erica Meier says, “consumers can now see what these gentle lambs are forced to endure in their final days.” In addition to meat, Superior Farms sells lambskin to the fashion industry, as well as animal parts—such as lungs, tails, trachea, and ears—to be used for producing dog treats. Meier advises that, “The best way we can help lambs and all animals is to leave them off our plates.” COK’s footage comes on the heels of last week’s release of a similar video documenting cruelty against pigs, captured by animal-rights group Mercy for Animals at Hormel supplier (and largest pork producer in the country) The Maschhoffs in Oklahoma.

Nothing much ordinarily, but that might change if a U.S. border adjustment tax becomes a reality. It all depends on how Asian suppliers deal with the proposed levy. The impact on them would be uneven, and not just because they have different levels of exposure to the American market. Some, like Li & Fung Ltd., might even benefit by helping global retailers navigate a confusing barrage of tariff structures, Gadfly's Shelly Banjo has argued. Tax Tremors Asian clothing and shoe suppliers have been hurt by U.S. border-adjustment tax rhetoric Source: Bloomberg *Market capitalization weighted average of 11 stocks tracked by Credit Suisse. But investors aren't too sanguine, as this share price chart of some of the largest Asian vendors tracked by Credit Suisse shows. Shareholders' fears are well founded. Should President Donald Trump adopt a 20 percent destination-based corporate tax, also known as a border adjustment tax, U.S. merchandise importers won't be able to claim a deduction on expenses incurred overseas (including labor costs). It would have the same effect as an additional levy on top of the existing average U.S. tariff of 11.5 percent on textiles and 17 percent on footwear imports. Trump's proposed border tax 20% The pain would likely be shared three ways. Shoppers at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. would have to pay more; the retailers would have to accept a thinner profit margin; and their suppliers in Asia would be forced to accept lower prices. It's hard to predict the outcome of that complex bargaining process. But if it leads to a 5 percent drop in the price received in Asia, then the $1.9 billion profit of 11 Hong Kong and Taiwan-listed vendors on $36 billion of combined revenue could drop by a fifth. Stella International Holdings Ltd., Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Ltd., Li & Fung and Makalot Industrial Co. could be the "most sensitive," according to Credit Suisse.  If Border Tax Comes A 5% cut in ex-factory prices for Asian suppliers could cause their earnings to tumble Source: Credit Suisse That isn't all. Should U.S. import volumes also slide, the impact could be even fiercer. Conversely, if the dollar rises in response to the tax, some of the pain for Asian exporters could ease. A weaker home currency, however, would mean a higher cost of living in Asia. That might be doubly worrisome if practically every country in the region -- from China, India, Indonesia, and Thailand to Pakistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Sri Lanka -- started losing jobs in labor-intensive production. Retaliation would be almost inevitable. U.S. banks' hopes to put their capital to work in Asia, especially if Trump's review of Dodd-Frank rules gives them additional leeway, could come a cropper if governments in the region block their expansion. The likelihood of tit-for-tat measures shouldn't be dismissed. Trade skirmishes are casting a shadow even over regional trade, such as between China and South Korea, as Asia witnesses a resurgence of nationalism in economic policy-making. Sample the recent blacklisting of JPMorgan Chase & Co. by the Indonesian government over an unfavorable research report.  If nothing else, this is just one of the many ways a U.S. border adjustment tax could cause the globalization cookie to crumble. Wall Street should put its lobbying might to work to dissuade the Trump administration from raising the cost of accessing U.S. consumers for Asian firms. Otherwise, global banks, too, might have to pay a price for those more expensive shoes and handbags. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

Asda will loan you the cash to buy a new car, before selling you annual insurance and breakdown cover. Then it’ll provide fuel, oils, parts, accessories, safety kit, mobile phones for gloveboxes plus countless other automotive products. But direct or indirect retailing of price-slashed cars for the masses it doesn’t do – yet.  True, the supermarket chain bravely tried several decades ago, but its then revolutionary Asdadrive project crashed and burned, largely because it was way ahead of its time. Since then, that Interweb thing has taken over and massively altered the world, where consumers are happy to order goods unseen from reputable outlets’ websites.  • How and where to buy a new car Back in the mid-eighties, the Asdadrive experiment suffered inventory and space problems as its cars stole valuable customer car parking bays that were required to display the mass-produced vehicles it was trying to sell. But now Internet-based shopping is the norm for many folk, non-franchised retailers of cars don’t need to have stock or great knowledge of the models they’re peddling to bargain-seekers, who usually know what they want and what they should pay. So the late 2010s and early 2020s are just right for Asdacars, or something similar. With vehicle manufacturers, their franchised dealers, plus Web-based specialist firms on one side and loyal, bargain-obsessed customers on the other, Asdacars could and should act as the go-between, the enabler, the facilitator. Give it time and I think it’ll happen.  • "Hyundai has been transforming how people buy cars" - Steve Fowler So why Asda and why not Sainsbury’s, Tesco or Morrison’s? Because Asda’s owned by Walmart. And this US-based retail giant has announced it’s saddling up with dealer groups and others as it moves into the car- selling business from 1 April. Customers will buy online via Walmart while at home or work or use in-store, self-op kiosks to place orders – with some of Walmart’s 2.1 million workers on hand to assist. But while they’ll be able to click in-store, they’ll usually collect from dealerships.  It’s inconceivable this truly global chain will not broaden its car retailing operation to other countries, Britain included. A further twist is a leading car company CEO has just told me, off the record, that “I’m in discussions with a couple of parties on this, and will keep you posted”. Almost certainly, ‘Asdacars’ is one. The identity of the other is top secret. But I suspect not for much longer.   Would you consider buying a car online?

Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images Share Share Tweet Share Comment Email Print advertisement President Donald Trump convened with the heads of some of America's largest corporations on Friday at the White House for a meeting intended to make good on the administration's pledge to reduce regulation, promote women in the workplace, and cut taxes. Meeting with biggest business leaders this morning. Good jobs are coming back to U.S., health care and tax bills are being crafted NOW!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2017 Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric, told CNBC it had been a "fabulous meeting" and said the president "engaged forcefully" on every topic. Steve Schwarzman, CEO of private equity firm Blackstone and chairman of the council that arranged Friday's meeting, said the session had been "spirited intellectually" and that the members had had a "balanced discussion" about "taxes, trade, infrastructure, women's issues, education, and how to bring home jobs in terms of training people in technology." Other attendees at Friday's business huddle included members of Trump's economic advisory council, such as JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon, Walt Disney's Bob Iger, Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon, and Mary Barra of General Motors. The meeting also included First Daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, senior adviser to the president; as well as Vice President Mike Pence and White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon. One notable absentee was Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who resigned from his spot on the president's council Thursday amid fierce backlash from customers furious at Kalanick's seeming connection to Trump's controversial immigration ban that limits travel to America from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Kalanick said Thursday that his participation on Trump's council was not meant to be construed as any endorsement of Trump's policies. However, billionaire inventor and environmentalist Elon Musk, also heavily criticized for his position on the board due to seemingly contradictory stances with Trump, has not shied away from his role. In contrast to Kalanick, Musk tweeted a message on Thursday explaining that he was remaining on the board in order to "serve the greater good." Regarding the meeting at the White House: pic.twitter.com/8b1XH4oW6h— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 3, 2017 Corporate America is struggling to please an increasing divide: Customers and investors who oppose Trump's hard-line policies, and those who applaud his strong-arm techniques. And many business leaders on the president's council are stuck between a rock and a hard place as they seek to advise — or at least appease — the president while remaining firm on their own values and satisfying those of their client base. Related: Many CEOs 'Scared Out of Their Minds', Won't Speak Out Against Trump Trump has already called out several major companies via Twitter, including General Motors, L.L. Bean, and Ford. In December, he tweeted, "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" Following his tweet, Boeing stocks slid by more than 1 percent in premarket trade.

Osvaldo D. Felix is accused of stealing a security system from Wal-Mart twice in five days, according to an Ephrata police news release. Police initially responded to the Walmart on Main Street in Ephrata for a car illegally parked in a handicapped space. Officers saw Felix enter the car with unpaid merchandise, including a $300 security system. Felix was charged with retail theft and taken to Lancaster County Prison on a separate warrant. He was later released on Jan. 25, police said. Surveillance footage caught Felix stealing the same security system at around 9:50 a.m. Jan. 26 at Wal-Mart. Additional retail theft charges have been filed for the second incident, police said.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) By John Wagner and Max Ehrenfreund By John Wagner and Max Ehrenfreund February 5 Follow @WPJohnWagner Follow @MaxEhrenfreund It could in theory be a perfect solution for President Trump — a “border adjustment tax” that helps him deliver corporate tax relief or a big infrastructure package, while potentially bolstering U.S. manufacturers and allowing him to claim that his marquee campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border has been paid for. But it might never happen. Trump first panned the idea as “too complicated.” Then his press secretary floated it late last month as a way to make Mexico pay for the wall. Soon after, the White House started to back away, claiming that the policy shift being pushed by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) is only one of many options under discussion. The early tensions over the tax plan and the mixed signals being sent by the White House provide a glimpse into what could become a major intraparty rift as Congress considers how to pay for the border wall and enact new tax cuts. House Republicans are counting on a windfall from a border adjustment tax to fund broader tax relief, but Senate Republicans remain cool to the idea, with some even mocking its potential consequences. “Simply put, any policy proposal which drives up costs of Corona, tequila, or margaritas is a big-time bad idea,” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said in a tweet. “Mucho Sad.” The White House’s position is, at best, inconsistent. “This is a source of very heated debate, even within the conservative community,” said Stephen Moore of the Heritage Foundation, a proponent of the border adjustment tax who advised Trump during his campaign. “It’s not going anywhere if you can’t at least rally Republicans around it.” Moore lamented that he did not spend more time pushing the idea on Trump when he had his ear. “I never had a chance to sit down and explain it to him. If I had, I think I could have told him it would accomplish a lot of what you want to do.” Democrats are poised for the fight, promising to argue that the tax would raise the cost of imported merchandise at Walmart and other retailers, hitting the very working-class voters who helped carry Trump to victory. Republicans also are facing a political dilemma of their own making. After years of deriding any tax increase as a burden on the economy, they find themselves trying to sell a more nuanced view, arguing that the border adjustment tax will be good for the taxpayers overall, even if it hits some businesses and consumers more than others. Under the House Republican plan, corporations would no longer have to include sales from exports when calculating their income for tax purposes. Meanwhile, profits on exports would be free of taxation. In the short term, the plan would generate a lot of money for the federal government. Since the United States imports more than it exports, the new taxes on imports would more than make up for the big break on exports. The plan would yield about $1.2 trillion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. That could allow Trump to move forward with a plan to cut corporate taxes to 15 percent from the current level of 35 percent. The proposal could bolster the manufacturing sector, including in Rust Belt states such as Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio that propelled Trump to the White House. Boosters of the House GOP plan say that the new system would be a boon for U.S. producers who compete with goods and services from overseas — although there is disagreement among economists about whether the system would accomplish that goal. And, as the White House suggested, a small fraction of the revenue raised from the tax could fund the $12 billion to $15 billion estimated cost of Trump’s wall — though whether that meets the definition of Mexico “paying for” the wall is another matter. Longtime Washington observers say it’s possible that the fate of the House GOP tax plan could become intertwined with that of Trump’s promise for a massive infrastructure package — an idea about which Republican leaders are lukewarm. Both initiatives are likely to be taken up in earnest in the spring. Trump has said he would like to see more than $1 trillion invested in the nation’s aging roads, bridges, airports and other critical infrastructure, though that initiative is expected to rely heavily on private-sector spending. If Trump comes on board, he faces a major sales job in the Republican-controlled Senate, said Jim Manley, a former senior aide to former Senate minority leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.). “The question is whether he could move them by the sheer force of his personality or an onslaught of tweets,” said Manley, now a Washington lobbyist. The border adjustment tax being pushed by House Republicans differs from the “border tax” that Trump mused about on the stump and on Twitter. Trump has been vague about his intentions, but the tax could be focused more punitively on particular companies and raise only a fraction of the revenue envisioned under the House GOP plan. Proponents of the broader House plan say that the current international tax system unfairly penalizes American companies. “We lose both here and abroad,” Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, recently told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “This means today Chinese steel is cheaper here in the U.S. than American steel. Mexican beef and autos are cheaper than American beef and autos. Foreign oil is cheaper than American oil.” Many economists, however, doubt that the GOP plan would have any real benefits for U.S. firms competing with foreign companies. They argue the price of the dollar in global currency markets would climb in response to the tax, canceling out any advantages for U.S. producers. A strong dollar makes U.S. exports relatively more expensive, and imports relatively cheaper. Trump’s only public comments about the border adjustment tax have cast cold water on the idea. In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, he called the idea “too complicated.” But that was before the kerfuffle late last month, when White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters that a 20 percent tax on goods coming in from Mexico would cover the cost of building the border wall. His comment was widely interpreted as an endorsement of the broader House GOP plan — but Spicer and other White House aides said later in the day that it was meant as just one possible way for paying for the wall. Adding to the confusion, Peter Navarro, the head of Trump’s National Trade Council, went on CNBC the following day and said, “There’s no question that we need a border adjustable tax of some kind.” But, he added, “It’s one that has to be flexible.” Navarro suggested that Japan and Germany be treated differently, for example, which is not what the House GOP plan envisions. Navarro was also asked what other leading advisers to Trump think about the idea. “They should speak in their own words,” he said, adding that he was sharing only his views. A request by The Washington Post to interview Navarro was referred by the White House to Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council. Cohn’s office said he was unavailable. In a CNBC interview Friday, Cohn said a border adjustment tax is “one of the options that is on the table” and suggested that revenue from the tax could help the administration achieve its other goals. Trump advisers began tax talks in early January in a meeting with Ryan and his team. Even aides to Ryan acknowledge there is a major education effort ahead to get lawmakers and others to understand the border adjustment tax proposal. But the lack of consensus among economists over the benefits and drawbacks of the idea has made rallying support behind it challenging. The Republican plan “has turned out to be like a Rorschach test,” said Edward Kleinbard, a legal scholar at the University of Southern California. “People can see in it anything they choose.” politics Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

At each step, jihadist handlers kept in constant touch with their recruits through encrypted messaging applications, right up to the men's arrest in June. (Atul Loke/The New York Times)(ATUL LOKE) By The New York Times HYDERABAD, India -- When the Islamic State identified a promising young recruit willing to carry out an attack in one of India's major tech hubs, the group made sure to arrange everything down to the bullets he needed to kill victims. For 17 months, terrorist operatives guided the recruit, a young engineer named Mohammed Ibrahim Yazdani, through every step of what they planned to be the Islamic State's first strike on Indian soil. They vetted each new member of the cell as Yazdani recruited helpers. They taught him how to pledge allegiance to the terrorist group and securely send the statement. And from Syria, investigators believe, the group's virtual plotters organized for the delivery of weapons as well as the precursor chemicals used to make explosives, directing the Indian men to hidden pickup spots. Until just moments before the arrest of the Indian cell, here in June, the Islamic State's cyberplanners kept in near-constant touch with the men, according to the interrogation records of three of the eight suspects obtained by The New York Times. As officials around the world have faced a confusing barrage of attacks dedicated to the Islamic State, cases like Yazdani's offer troubling examples of what counterterrorism experts are calling enabled or remote-controlled attacks: violence conceived and guided by operatives in areas controlled by ISIS whose only connection to the would-be attacker is the internet. In the most basic enabled attacks, ISIS handlers acted as confidants and coaches, coaxing recruits to embrace violence. In the Hyderabad plot, among the most involved found so far, the terrorist group reached deep into a country with strict gun laws in order to arrange for pistols and ammunition to be left in a bag swinging from the branches of a tree. For the most part, the operatives who are conceiving and guiding such attacks are doing so from behind a wall of anonymity. When the Hyderabad plotters were arrested last summer, they could not so much as confirm the nationalities of their ISIS interlocutors, let alone describe what they looked like. Because the recruits are instructed to use encrypted messaging applications, the guiding role played by the terrorist group often remains obscured. As a result, remotely guided plots in Europe, Asia and the United States in recent years, including the attack on a community center in Garland, Texas, were initially labeled the work of "lone wolves," with no operational ties to ISIS, and only later was direct communication with the group discovered. While the trail of many of these plots led back to planners living in Syria, the very nature of the group's method of remote plotting means there is little dependence on its maintaining a haven there or in Iraq. And visa restrictions and airport security mean little to attackers who strike where they live and no longer have to travel abroad for training. Close examination of both successful and unsuccessful plots carried out in the Islamic State's name over the past three years indicates that such enabled attacks are making up a growing share of the operations of the group. "They are virtual coaches who are providing guidance and encouragement throughout the process -- from radicalization to recruitment into a specific plot," said Nathaniel Barr, a terrorism analyst at Valens Global, who along with Daveed Gartenstein-Ross of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington wrote one of the first articles discussing the virtual plotters. "If you look at the communications between the attackers and the virtual plotters, you will see that there is a direct line of communication to the point where they are egging them on minutes, even seconds, before the individual carries out an attack." Detailing this kind of plot direction has become a critical focus of counterterrorism officials in the United States and Europe, as they try to track terror planners who pose a lasting threat and to unravel the criminal networks that the group uses as middlemen to facilitate attacks. Yazdani's case presents one of the most detailed accounts of how ISIS is exporting terrorism virtually. This style of attack has allowed the terrorist group's reach to stretch into countries as disparate as France and Malaysia, Germany and Indonesia, Bangladesh and Australia. And plots have been discovered in multiple locations in the United States, including in Columbus, Ohio, the suburbs of Washington and upstate New York. "I fear this is the future of ISIS," said Bridget Moreng, an analyst whose research on the virtual plotters was recently published in Foreign Affairs. A diverse portfolio Until roughly a year ago, ISIS recruiters aggressively pushed the message that going to Syria was a spiritual obligation. They described the physical journey as a "hijrah," the Arabic word used to refer to the Prophet Muhammad's journey to escape persecution in Mecca, imbuing the act with religious meaning. The recruiters hid within an ocean of 2.3 billion live social media accounts, flooding the internet with romanticized videos of life inside the caliphate, as well as brutal execution videos, using them as clickbait to lure potential recruits. One of the Islamic State's most influential recruiters and virtual plotters was known by the nom de guerre Abu Issa al-Amriki, and his Twitter profile instructed newcomers to contact him via the encrypted messaging app Telegram. Among those who sought him out, asking for instructions on how to reach Syria, was Yazdani, who had convinced himself that it was his religious duty to move his family to the caliphate. By 2015, al-Amriki was one of close to a dozen cyberplanners based in Syria or Iraq who were recruiting volunteers abroad, according to a tally based on investigation records from North America, Europe and Asia. Initially, they made little effort to hide, posting grandiose threats against the West on public social media feeds. They were sometimes discounted as mere cheerleaders for the terrorist group. But by late spring 2015, they were considered enough of a threat that both U.S. and British intelligence began tracking their movements, methodically targeting them with airstrikes and killing several since then. Among them was al-Amrik, who was killed along with his wife on April 22 when a bomb flattened their apartment in Al Bab, Syria. The Pentagon press secretary, Peter Cook, identified him as a Sudanese citizen also known as Abu Sa'ad al-Sudani, and described him as one of ISIS' "external attack planners" who "actively sought to harm Western interests." The Defense Department's account showed, moreover, that the handler had been involved in far more than just the Hyderabad case, planning attacks on three continents. At the same time that he was recruiting Yazdani, al-Amriki was grooming attackers in Canada and Britain, as well as at least three other young men in suburbs across the United States, according to court records. They included a former member of the Army National Guard living in Virginia; a warehouse worker from Columbus, Ohio; and Emanuel L. Lutchman, a 25-year-old in Rochester, New York. Looking for ways to get to Syria, Lutchman reached out to al-Amriki on Dec. 25, 2015, asking what it was like to live inside territory controlled by the group. "Dream come true," al-Amriki responded, before telling the young man that the Syrian border had been closed, according to the criminal complaint. Instead, the handler suggested Lutchman carry out an attack right at home on New Year's Eve -- less than a week after their first exchange. Plan an "operation" and kill "1000000s of kuffar," al-Amriki instructed him, using a derogatory Arabic word meaning infidel. Over the course of several chats via the Telegram service, they planned how Lutchman would attack a bar serving craft beer to celebrate the holiday, prosecutors say. The two men discussed recruiting three other "brothers" to take part. They stayed in contact as Lutchman went to Wal-Mart, where he spent $40 on two ski masks, two knives, a machete, zip-ties, duct tape and latex gloves. He planned to abduct one of the bar's customers and videotape himself killing the victim, prosecutors say. And they exchanged a flurry of messages, as the 25-year-old began to voice doubts and the handler assumed the role of therapist, patiently listening and reassuring him. Lutchman was arrested at his home the day before his planned attack on Merchants Grill in Rochester, outed by the accomplice he had recruited, who turned out to be an FBI informant. At the time of his arrest, Lutchman had been communicating with the handler for a total of five days. It appears he never heard his handler's voice, or saw so much as photograph of him, according to the court filings. By late 2015, travel to Syria had become treacherous. Intelligence services on both sides of the Atlantic were getting better at identifying aspiring jihadis, arresting dozens as they prepared to board flights for Istanbul in hopes of crossing into Syria. At first, ISIS operatives instructed recruits to throw off law enforcement by taking more indirect routes. They also began urging followers to head to other ISIS colonies, including in Libya. That was what law enforcement officials said a young man from Columbus, Ohio, Aaron T. Daniels, was trying to do in November, when he was arrested while trying to board a United Airlines flight to Houston, from where he would travel to Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, before continuing toward Libya. No longer describing the journey to Syria as a spiritual necessity, ISIS announced last year that those who could not reach the caliphate should attack at home. "If the tyrants have closed in your faces the door of hijrah, then open in their face the door of jihad," the group's spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, said in a message released in May. Local assets At the time al-Amriki was killed in April, he had been exchanging messages with Yazdani in India for more than a year, patiently offering encouragement as his recruit tried and failed to get a visa first to Greece, and then to Turkey in an effort to reach Syria. One of eight children, Yazdani, 30, grew up in a cramped apartment in the slum of Aman Nagar B, in a narrow alley that smells of sewage in Hyderabad's Old City. He beat the odds, earning an engineering degree and landing a job as a quality inspector in Saudi Arabia for nearly four years, before returning to India. While abroad, he began watching ISIS online propaganda, and soon he became consumed by a desire to leave it all for the caliphate. "Since then, I was inclined to join Islamic State and work for the cause of religion," Yazdani told investigators from India's National Investigation Agency, according to his interrogation record, which was obtained by The Times and was first reported by NDTV, a New Delhi-based television company. He logged into Twitter and searched the hashtags #ISIS and #Khilafa, the terrorist group's preferred spelling of caliphate. In a few keystrokes, he made contact with al-Amriki. "I created a Telegram ID," Yazdani told investigators, "and sought his guidance to reach Syria." After months of frustrating and failed attempts to help Yazdani get a visa, al-Amriki's directions changed course: "He asked me to work for IS by staying in India itself." It was a period in which ISIS was refining the way it exports terror, increasingly relying on cyberplanners with local knowledge. Just before his death, al-Amriki handed off Yazdani to a different handler, known only by his Telegram screen name, "WindsofVictory." His identity has not yet been confirmed by Indian officials, though they believe he is Indian because he spoke fluent Hindi. The new handler guided the eight-member cell as it took shape, exchanging messages with Yazdani as the engineer recruited his family members and friends. They named themselves "Jund-ul-Khilafa-Fi-Bilad-Hind," the Army of the Caliphate in India, according to the interrogation records, which misspelled part of the Arabic name. At the end of May, Yazdani received a message telling him to go to the Nanded Airport, about 200 miles away. He and an accomplice, Habeeb Mohammed, 31, drove all night. After they reached the airport the next morning, the handler told them to head to the Railway Division Office. Near that office, he said, they would see a plastic bag hanging from a tree, according to the transcripts of the men's interrogations. "It was informed by the handler that opposite to DRM office, there are two trees and on one of the trees there would be a white color polyethylene sheet (used for wrapping fragile articles)," Mohammed told investigators. "We spotted the place, and I, first on the pretext of urinating, went to check for the consignment." When they opened the bag, they found two pistols and 20 bullets, according to their account to law enforcement. It was one of at least four drops the handler set up for them. Because the pistols were rusted, they say the handler instructed them to travel to the railway station in the city of Ajmer, about 600 miles to the north. This time they were told to bring 65,000 rupees -- around $1,000 -- and leave it near the railway track sealed in a plastic bag, which would be picked up and used as payment for weapons. Because the communication always had to go through the handler, the members of the Hyderabad cell never directly interacted with the arms seller. When they were arrested, they could not provide any clues as to who had left the contraband, Indian investigators said. The Hindi-speaking handler guiding the men in Hyderabad also insisted on using a kaleidoscope of encrypted messaging applications, with Yazdani instructed to hop between apps so that even if one message history was discovered and cracked, it would reveal only a portion of their handiwork. As soon as Yazdani indicated he was willing to undertake an attack, the handler instructed him to download ChatSecure, a messaging app to be used when they spoke by phone. When he used his laptop, he was told to contact the handler via Pidgin, another encrypted tool. He was told to create an account with Tutanota, a secure email service. And the handler taught Yazdani how to use the Tails operating system, which is contained on a USB stick and allows a user to boot up a computer from the external device and use it without leaving a trace on the hard drive. Once that system was in place, the handler told Yazdani to prepare a handwritten oath of allegiance, known as a "bayah," to ISIS' leader. Members of the cell signed it using their noms de guerre, and Yazdani was told to scan it to his laptop, using Tails to obscure the operation. Next, he was told to upload it to gulf-up.com, which allows users to upload files and produces a URL that can be shared with a third party. The link to the URL was to be sent via the secure email. By methodically working through URLs archived on the website, The Times was able to find the image of the one-page handwritten document containing the Indian men's pledge of allegiance to ISIS. The file was uploaded around the time Yazdani told investigators he had done so, and the document matched his description of the wording he had disclosed to the authorities. Until they were alerted to its existence, Indian investigators were not aware that the document was still archived on the website, they said. The men's families have denied that they played any role in a terrorist plot, and accuse the authorities of planting evidence against them. One Indian investigator, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters, said officials were able to crack the full extent of the case only because Yazdani and his accomplices confessed during interrogation, divulging the passwords to their accounts after their arrests last summer. Global reach Though the Hyderabad case is among the most detailed in showing how Syria-based handlers directly facilitated terrorist attacks abroad, it is neither the first, nor the only one. Investigation documents from Europe show that a growing share of attacks bear signs of contact with the ISIS stronghold, even though the attacker was initially described as acting alone. The first time officials in Europe described an attack as having been "telecommande," or remote-controlled, was in spring 2015 after a young information technology student named Sid Ahmed Ghlam tried to open fire on a church in the Paris suburb of Villejuif. Instead, he shot himself in the leg. When the police searched his car, they found his Lenovo laptop containing a series of messages showing how he, too, had been guided by a pair of handlers who provided both the weapons and the getaway car, according to hundreds of pages of police and intelligence records obtained by The Times. "OK, brother, now pay attention," one of the messages begins, instructing the then-23-year-old to head to the suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois, where he would find the automatic weapons in a bag left in a locked car parked near a sandwich shop. "Search among the cars that are parked there near the big road and look for a Renault Megane," the message said. "Look at the front right tire -- you'll find the keys placed on top." The handler then instructed him to store the weapons in another car in a parking garage 10 miles away, a precaution in case his apartment was searched. Later, French investigators said they had found that Ghlam's handlers were French citizens who had traveled to Syria to join ISIS. They, in turn, tapped their criminal network back in France to arrange the logistics of Ghlam's plot. Seamus Hughes, deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the handlers were essentially "quarterbacking" the attack: "They're from there, so they can essentially tell someone, 'OK, go 10 yards and go this way." Wiretaps, interrogation records and transcripts of chats recovered on suspects' phones and laptops show that this level of guidance has occurred all over the world. In Germany, a man who set off a bomb outside a concert and a teenager who assaulted train passengers with an ax were both chatting with handlers until minutes before their attacks. The teenager's handler urged him to use a car instead of an ax -- "The damage would be much greater," the handler advised -- but the young man said he did not have a driving permit. "I want to enter paradise tonight," he said, according to a transcript obtained by a German newspaper. In northern France, a pair of attackers who had been guided by an Islamic State cybercoach slit the throat of an 85-year-old priest. The pair had not known each other, and according to the investigative file, the handler introduced them, organizing for them to meet days before the attack. Intelligence records obtained by The Times reveal that the same handler in Syria also guided a group of young women who tried to blow up a car in front of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris. And investigations into attacks in Malaysia, Indonesia and Bangladesh reveal that the recruits were directly communicating with Islamic State handlers who molded the plots as they took shape and helped arrange logistics, in some cases wiring money. In several investigations, a pattern has emerged: The attacker initially tries to reach Syria, but is either blocked by the authorities in the home country or else turned back from the border. Under the instructions of a handler in Syria or Iraq, the person then begins planning an attack at home. Law enforcement officials describe that sequence of events in one of the most recent foiled attacks in France, where a group of people are accused of plotting to hit the popular Christmas market in Strasbourg, having been given the GPS coordinates of a location to pick up weapons. At least one of the five men arrested had been turned back from Turkey, French prosecutors said. Weak Links While a reliance on local amateurs has allowed ISIS to announce that it can stage terrorism around the world, it has also led to many failed attacks. Instead of opening fire on a church, Ghlam shot himself in the leg. Instead of laying waste to a music festival this past summer, the ISIS recruit in Germany detonated his bomb prematurely, killing only himself. The same thing happened the day before the end of Ramadan on July 2 inside a police compound in Indonesia, where another remotely guided attacker hit the switch on his crudely assembled suicide vest. "He didn't even knock over the flowerpot on the ledge next to where he blew himself up," said Sidney Jones, director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict. Indonesian officials say the suicide bomber had been incited to attack by Bahrun Naim, a 33-year-old Indonesian man who is one of the Islamic State's most prolific cyberplanners, operating from the group's capital in Raqqa, Syria. Initially, Naim wired money to families in Indonesia to pay for travel to Syria, officials said. Later, the bank transfers he sent were to be used to buy the chemicals needed to build explosives, according to the interrogation records of his recruits. In just over a year, the young men with whom he was in touch attempted at least six attacks, targeting a police post, a Buddhist temple and a church, as well as foreigners visiting the country. In November, a college dropout who the police said had at least been initially in contact with Naim was arrested as he prepared to attack the Myanmar Embassy. In his home, the police recovered a quantity of explosives that could have resulted in a blast twice as powerful as the 2002 Bali bombing, which killed 202 people, the police spokesman told local news media. Yet nearly all of the plots attributed to Naim have failed. And it was human error that finally led to the arrest of al-Amriki's followers in Hyderabad. The plot began to unravel in June after the men were instructed to collect a 10-kilogram bag of ammonium nitrate left beside a canal next to mile marker No. 9 on the Vijayawada Highway. They returned to Mohammed's home to begin preparing a bomb, but could not figure out how to replicate the steps in the instructional YouTube video sent to them by the handler. "We could not succeed in making powder, as it became jellylike paste," Yazdani lamented, according to the transcript of his interrogation. They tried using a tea strainer. They tried heating it longer. They began talking on their cellphones about their efforts to "cook the rice." By then, the police were wiretapping their calls and suspected that all the food talk was a crude attempt at misdirection. Early on June 29, the police banged on the door of Mohammed's home. In his bedroom, they found the half-cooked explosive in his refrigerator.

Kalanick wrote to his employees that he'd spoken with Trump on Thursday to "let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that." His departure came on the eve of the first meeting of the group at the White House, planned for Friday. Disney CEO Bob Iger won't attend either; instead he will be at a company board meeting in California, according to a person close to Iger who requested anonymity to discuss the CEO's schedule. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment. Led by Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive of the private equity group Blackstone, the council has about 15 members, including the leaders of Wal-Mart, Tesla, the Cleveland Clinic and Pepsi. The council is "designed to provide direct input to the president from many of the best and brightest in the business world in a frank, non-bureaucratic, and nonpartisan manner," according to a Blackstone press release in December announcing its formation. Yet public outcry about Trump - specifically his executive order suspending the country's refugee program and halting other aspects of immigration - has put some business leaders in an uncomfortable spot. Uber, a ride-sharing company popular in urban, largely Democratic areas, has been buffeted all week by boycott campaigns that began when people perceived it as trying to break a taxi strike to and from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport that was in response to the executive order. Kalanick condemned the executive order and has contributed to relief groups, but calls for a boycott had continued. One woman urging boycotts for all companies tied to Trump said only total resignation from the Trump business forum would satisfy her. "This is not a 'seat at the table' moment. This is a flip-the-table moment," said Shannon Coulter, one of the organizers of the anti-Trump social media campaign "Grab Your Wallet." Other forum members said they'd keep their commitment. Toby Cosgrove, CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, is planning to attend. "He has an opportunity to talk directly to the president, and that is a good opportunity," said spokeswoman Eileen Sheil. Sheil said the clinic employs doctors and caretakers from many countries, and was directly affected by the travel ban. She said a Sudanese citizen who is a first-year resident at the Cleveland Clinic is stuck in Sudan and unable to return to work. General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra remains a member of the advisory group and plans to attend the Friday meeting, spokesman Patrick Morrissey said. Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk said in a statement that he'd attend. He said he and others on the council "will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy."

(Photo Illustration by Johannes Hart/New York Daily News) BY Ross Barkan SPECIAL TO THE DAILY NEWS Sunday, February 5, 2017, 5:00 AM An infinitesimal number of people in human history know what it's like to possess many millions or billions of dollars. Money to keep your descendants rich long after you're dead. Money to follow whatever impulse coursing through your brain. Money beyond all reason. Money that tends to surround you with people who praise you at every turn and nod when you speak. Donald Trump, by most accounts, is the wealthiest person to ever occupy the White House, though details of his income and wealth won't be known until he releases his tax returns, which will probably be never. His cabinet-in-waiting and inner circle is undoubtedly the richest ever assembled. Betsy DeVos, Wilbur Ross and Linda McMahon are all billionaires. Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, is worth hundreds of millions. Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, occupies a similar stratum, and the architect of Trump's apocalyptic nationalism, Steve Bannon, is an alt-right mogul who has earned a fortune from Seinfeld royalties, despite never working on the show. Being extraordinarily rich, either through inheritance or hard work or some combination of the two, may or may not be an indicator of aptitude. But one thing is certain: With great wealth comes great confidence. If you've acquired a fortune in the private sector, and the swagger to match, the public sector must seem wholly tamable, crammed with bureaucrats who've never had a "real job" or had to claw for a paycheck in a world without discernable safety nets. "I alone can fix it," Trump declared at the Republican National Convention, a show of hubris that comes with believing you've amassed enough money to do just about anything — including running the United States of America. It wasn't the first or last time Trump saw a straight line between business-world success and a string of certain victories in public service. "I'm the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far," Trump boasted in 2015, shortly before he kicked off his campaign. "Nobody's ever been more successful than me." The fatal flaw in Trump's psychology is endemic to many wealthy people who attempt new ventures. Prior spectacular success (Trump's business triumphs are debatable, but he at least has enough money to campaign in a private jet) clouds doubt, and a messianic assumption takes hold: Whatever I do, it must be right. For New Yorkers, this mindset was often evident in a man who would go on to become Trump's harsher critics, Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg, the self-made billionaire and former three-term mayor, was transformative, rightly recognized for leading the nation in banning indoor smoking, repurposing post-industrial waste for parkland and guiding the city out of its post-9/11 doldrums. His national campaigns for gun control and against obesity were commendable. And unlike Trump, Bloomberg usually surrounded himself with a cadre of qualified individuals willing to disagree with him when the time came. Even still, the man's Pharaonic net worth fueled a singular arrogance that was ultimately his undoing. Though he never declared, like Trump, that "I alone" can fix the city, his actions spoke to that sentiment. In 2003, as rising real estate prices began to drive the city's middle class and poor to the fringes, he said that New York was a "luxury product," not the "lowest-priced product" like Walmart. If working stiffs couldn't live here, too bad. 36 photos view gallery Donald Trump in the White House After the 2008 economic collapse, he engineered an overturning of the popular term limits law, granting himself a third term. He reasoned that New York needed his financial expertise one more time, rejecting the notion that any other leader, Democratic or Republican, was fit to lead the city. Bloomberg's third term, borne out of this arrogance, marred what could have been a far more uplifting legacy. His choice of Cathie Black, a Kushner-like neophyte when it came to education, as the city schools chancellor was so disastrous that the former Hearst executive resigned after only 95 days. When a blizzard rocked the city in 2010, Bloomberg blithely encouraged residents to take in a Broadway show and rode out the storm Bermuda, his weekend getaway. More miseries piled up later, from the CityTime corruption scandal to Hurricane Sandy, a storm the city failed to adequately respond to, leaving residents homeless for years. Most unfortunately, perhaps, Bloomberg allowed his unflagging belief in himself to cloud his ability to respond to complaints about his police department. Since he, as a powerful white man, never knew what it was like to have a police officer stop and search him repeatedly, he disregarded the pain of black and brown New Yorkers, and indulged in Trumpian hyperbole when activists and Democrats called for the NYPD to curtail the ballooning number of stop-and-frisks, telling reporters in 2013 he "wouldn't want to be responsible for a lot of people dying." There was never much soul-searching from Bloomberg. Even today, he would never lament the unintended consequences of his economic policies, like the rampant gentrification driving ever increasing numbers of poor and working-class people out of the city. For Bloomberg and Trump, apologies are all but nonexistent. How could a relative pauper possibly pass judgment on a man with enough money to purchase a small nation-state? Perhaps it comes down to this: The ultra-wealthy, especially those who owe a great deal of their wealth to family and circumstance, forget how much they owe to happenstance. They misconstrue lucky breaks with native skill. The happenstance and circumstance, the narrative-ruining realities of genetics and timing, are conveniently forgotten. Trump has credited his own brainpower-a "winning gene" in at least one interview-with his success. As the late Wayne Barrett meticulously documented, Trump owes many of his accomplishments in the real estate world to his father, one of New York's most powerful developers. Fred Trump's substantial wealth and political connections paved the way for Trump in Manhattan, allowing him both an entry point into a rarefied world and a cushion for his monumental failures. His father had to sign his bank documents. So far, Trump's White House is not only America's wealthiest, but perhaps its most incompetent. Yes, it's early, and all administrations are prone to rookie mistakes. But Trump has surrounded himself with so few humble, practiced hands than he's dramatically increased the odds of making major mistakes. He is far rasher and more impulsive than Bloomberg ever was, so hideously cocksure that he can hardly trust anyone but himself.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Have any doubt that Trump doesn't know what he doesn't know? Recall his regular boasts that he knew more about ISIS than the generals do, and had good reason to trust sources other than the U.S. intelligence community. The shoddy execution of the immigration ban demonstrated the consequences of such an attitude in horrifying real-time. Trump's executive order barring citizens and refugees from seven Muslim-majority nations, beyond its immorality, was implemented in isolation, undertaken as only a tone-deaf mogul with excessive confidence in his own abilities would. The State Department, the Defense Department and the Justice Department did not help him craft it. Trump's secretary of homeland security, John Kelly, only saw the details shortly before the order was finalized. The result? American citizens and green card holders, in addition to refugees who thought they'd already secured a place in our nation, were halted at airports. Chaos ensued. Officials on the ground scrambled to catch up. Federals judges issued stays. Around the same time he was signing the immigration executive order, Trump was elevating Bannon to a post on the National Security Council while limiting the roles of his Joint Chiefs of Staff and director of National Intelligence. Bannon has no foreign policy experience. But he is rich and Trump likes what he says. In Trump's Alice in Wonderland White House, a deficiency of expertise is an asset, and pretenders truly can inherit the throne. The pretenders may well have cost the life of an American Navy SEAL. Over dinner, less than a week into taking office, Trump hastily approved a military raid in Yemen to gather intelligence on an Al Qaeda collaborator. The raid was risky and the Obama administration had postponed the operation. But with Bannon and Kushner's blessing — the two men of course attended the dinner with military advisers — the soldiers were sent into combat. There is risk inherent in any such operation, and we'll never know exactly what to attribute to poor planning. But we do know that Trump's team made a series of bad judgments. Al Qaeda fighters knew they were coming, dooming the raid. In addition to the American commando, several civilians died, including the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born Al Qaeda leader who was killed in a drone strike in 2011. A $75 million aircraft was also destroyed. Past Presidents understood that advisers with high-level experience in government were mandatory. Even Presidents who experienced meteoric rises, like Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, knew they needed to surround themselves with experts and seasoned hands. They knew from their careers as elected officials, attorneys and, in Obama's case, activism, that magic wands and obscene self-regard are not enough to move Washington. Bannon and Kushner, with egos to match their bank accounts, are little more than enablers in this shambolic new order, overmatched for the tasks ahead of them. Kushner was a largely ineffective steward of a mid-sized, weekly newspaper, and a real estate developer who never would have had a career without his father, a self-made millionaire like Fred Trump. After overseeing a presidential campaign that was largely improvised by Trump himself and the beneficiary of extraordinary luck, including a historically unpopular Democratic nominee, Kushner has been elevated to heights once unimaginable. Money can't buy foresight or experience. This is something the historically unpopular Trump White House will learn soon enough. Barkan is a writer in New York.

World MEXICO & THE AMERICAS In Mexico, Trump triggers a surge in patriotism, anti-American sentiment MEXICO-US-BORDER-FUEL-PROTEST Yuri Cortez / AFP/Getty Images People gather Jan. 31 at El Zocalo square in Mexico City during a protest against a gasoline price increase and U.S. President Donald Trump's plan of building a wall on the border.

(Yuri Cortez / AFP/Getty Images) Laura Tillman Recently, Alma Siller Contreras traveled to the U.S. Consulate in the northern Mexican city of Hermosillo with a mission: to hand over her tourist visa, along with a handwritten message about U.S. President Trump. “This is my way of protesting against him and supporting my beloved country and its people,” Contreras wrote. She had long used her tourist visa to shop and visit family north of the border, but began contemplating giving it up when she and her husband watched Trump announce his candidacy with what she considered an odious attack on the character of the Mexican people.  “I said, ‘He has a hatred in his soul; this isn’t normal. He’s not prepared to be a leader of a country. This is dangerous,’” Contreras recalled. “I said, ‘If he wins, I’m going to return my visa.’ My husband said, ‘I don’t think he’ll win, he’s crazy.’ I never thought it would happen.” On Jan. 30, she made good on her pledge. Through actions big and small, a wave of nationalism is rising in Mexico. It’s not joyous or self-congratulatory. These expressions of patriotism appear defensive, uneasy and even mournful in tone, as Mexicans wait to see whether Trump’s threats will turn to action. In the meantime, many here are asking themselves what they can do to support their fellow citizens. The answers take many forms. South of the border, Mexicans are puzzled by Trump's relentless and pointless antagonism Robin Abcarian The police academy graduation ceremony in Tecate, Mexico, was a solemn affair.   As hundreds of family members looked on, 106 newly minted police officers and state marshals stood at attention, marched in formation on the flat, sun-baked parade grounds, and accepted diplomas from law enforcement... The police academy graduation ceremony in Tecate, Mexico, was a solemn affair.   As hundreds of family members looked on, 106 newly minted police officers and state marshals stood at attention, marched in formation on the flat, sun-baked parade grounds, and accepted diplomas from law enforcement... (Robin Abcarian) For Luis Alberto Trasviña, a history teacher in Baja California, action meant bringing his family to the Mexican capital on vacation instead of going to the U.S. — a way to support the national economy and avoid anti-Mexican sentiment. For chef Eduardo Garcia, owner of several restaurants in Mexico City, it meant offering free classes on using Mexican-produced ingredients. The first class instructed 50 students in how to choose and use Mexican avocados. For a group of families from a Protestant church with Mexican and expat members in Mexico City, it meant organizing to protest anti-immigrant policies. “We want to do something, and people feel helpless,” said Doug Keillor, a member of the group and founder of a nonprofit that advocates for juveniles in Mexico’s criminal justice system. Though Keillor’s wife was pushed and told to go back to the U.S. while she was shopping at a Wal-Mart in December, Keillor viewed the incident as an aberration. Most Mexicans, he said, are savvy about U.S. politics. Keillor, who notes he and his wife are adopting a 2-year-old Mexican boy, added, “If we eventually move back to the U.S., we come from a very homogeneous part of Minnesota, a very red, politically, part of Minnesota — are we going to be very excited to bring our Mexican son to live there?”  A movement to buy Mexican products is also being pushed in friendly conversation and by government officials. President Enrique Peña Nieto relaunched the label "Hecho en Mexico," or Made in Mexico, last week on Twitter, saying the label should signify quality and trustworthiness. On social media, profile pictures have switched to Mexican flags. Hashtags such as #AdiosAStarbucks encourage consumers to boycott U.S. brands. But some Mexicans find it all a bit silly. Luis Padilla, a 20-year-old university student in Mexico City, has no plans to change his spending habits, or his brand of coffee.   “I like their coffee, and simply not buying a cup of their coffee is not going to hurt the president over there,” he said. Pragmatically, he would continue to buy the brands of clothes he preferred, whether from the U.S. or Japan or Mexico, and he expected that the trend to boycott U.S. products would pass among his peers as well. “It’s not bad to experiment with the traditions of other countries. It’s always good to learn,” he said. But it appears some Mexicans are steering away from U.S. products. The Alsea company, which owns the Starbucks brand in Mexico, has tried to communicate to consumers that its coffee is from Chiapas, that it employs more than 7,000 people in the country, and that it’s completely Mexican-owned. At a Starbucks in Mexico City’s Condesa neighborhood, baristas seemed frazzled by the overnight shift in public opinion.  “I don’t think it’s well thought-out,” barista Luis Maguey said of the trend. “It was shocking to see —  it made me sad. We work to support our families.” Kevin Ganser, a 29-year-old entrepreneur, said the election of Trump had prompted him to go all-in on a new startup that aims to link expats with housing in Mexico City. When Americans look up Mexico City, he wants them to be greeted with a “warm and friendly face.”  Some politicians have suggested that if Trump’s policies inflict damage on Mexico, the country could rebound if Mexicans keep their heads down and work harder. That rhetoric frustrates Alfredo Perez, a 48-year-old engineer, who says it pre-supposes that Mexicans aren’t doing the the best they can for themselves and their families. The work week in Mexico is already six days long. “How are we going to work more?” he asked. As for Contreras, whose letter went viral after her cousin posted it on Facebook (Contreras herself doesn’t have a profile), she has no regrets about what she considers a personal choice to stand up for her country.  “Mexicans are good people. There are always exceptions anywhere, but in general, the humble people of Mexico have very good hearts. I am Mexican, and [Trump] can’t generalize all Mexicans are this way or that, that all people from a country are the way that he imagines in his distorted brain,” she said. “This is a place of faith, and of hope.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss An appeals court has ruled: Trump's travel ban will remain blocked.

(Evan Vucci, AP) Multimedia   ·   User Galleries   ·   News in Pictures Send us your pictures  ·  Send us your stories What To Read Next {{item.title}} Related Links Donald Trump praises wrong Ivanka Ivanka Trump doesn't want to fall with dad Donald Melania Trump is set to be a long-distance first lady Washington - She may have no official White House title. But Ivanka Trump already is proving that she is an unofficial power player. This week, the first daughter joined President Donald Trump at a policy meeting with business executives and accompanied him on a trip to Delaware's Dover Air Force Base on Wednesday to honour the returning remains of a US Navy SEAL killed in a raid in Yemen. She also hosted CEOs at her home to talk policy and used her influence behind the scenes at the White House. These efforts have only underscored questions about the role Ivanka Trump, 35, expects to play after resigning executive positions with the Trump Organisation and her own lifestyle brand to move to Washington. For now, though, it's her husband who is officially working in the administration. "My father will be president, and hopefully, I can be there to support him and to support those causes I've cared about my whole professional career," Trump told ABC's 20/20 last month. Whatever Ivanka Trump does, it will likely be unprecedented. There are no models for a member of the first family with a prominent policy role on the outside - or a first daughter with this much influence on the inside. Ivanka Trump has sought to halt speculation that she will serve as a fill-in first lady, which has only been heightened by Melania Trump's decision to continue living in New York City, where son Barron goes to school. Ivanka Trump told 20/20 that "there is one first lady". But joining the president on the sombere trip to Dover was the kind of duty that would typically fall to the president's spouse. "That's a typical scene you usually see played out with the president and the first lady, not the first daughter," said Katherine Jellison, who chairs the history department at Ohio University. Back in Washington, Ivanka Trump has continued her efforts to gather information about workplace policies for women. She hosted a dinner at her home in the tony Kalorama neighbourhood for many of the business leaders attending a White House meeting, including the top executives at Wal-Mart, General Motors and Johnson & Johnson, according to people with knowledge of the event. They requested anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss a private dinner. Trump also weighed in this week on a policy matter behind the scenes. Along with Kushner, she discouraged a possible executive order that would have impacted LGBTQ workplace rights and supported a White House statement that went out pledging to leave intact a 2014 executive order that protects workers for federal contractors from anti-LGBTQ discrimination, according to a person with knowledge of Ivanka Trump's role in the discussion, which was first reported by Politico. Bumps Ivanka also hit a few bumps this week - and learned about the bigger spotlight for the first family. She drew criticism on social media last weekend when she posted a picture of herself and husband Jared Kushner in formalwear a day after her father announced an executive order barring refugees from certain countries. A source close to Ivanka said she feels badly about what happened and regrets the post. Her self-named lifestyle brand also took a hit when Nordstrom announced it will stop selling Ivanka Trump clothing and accessories, creating some questions about the future of the brand elsewhere. The Seattle-based department store chain said the decision was based on the sales performance. Rosemary K Young, senior director of marketing at Ivanka Trump, said in a statement that the brand "continues to expand across categories and distribution with increased customer support, leading us to experience significant year-over-year revenue growth in 2016". A brand spokesperson said Nordstrom did order both shoes and clothing for spring and moved forward with the purchase of clothing. Last month, Trump said she will take a "formal leave of absence" from her executive positions at the Trump Organisation and her lifestyle brand - which offers shoes, clothes and messages of female empowerment. Her company will be run by the current president and a board of trustees. Complicated The process of unwinding those roles is complicated. The Trump Organisation has not filed paperwork yet to remove Ivanka Trump from its liquor license for a company tied to the Trump Soho hotel in Manhattan, according to New York State Liquor Authority spokesperson William Crowley. He said companies must update their licenses within 10 business days of any management changes, and that requires agency review and approval first, and that process has not even begun because the agency has not received a request yet. Alan Garten, chief legal officer for the Trump Organisation, said on Friday that all paperwork had been filed to separate Ivanka Trump from the businesses. He noted that it was a lengthy process, which took several weeks. He did not immediately answer questions about that specific liquor license.

EVERETT — A 36-year-old woman would stay in vacation rentals and rummage through belongings owners left behind. With tidbits of personal information, she allegedly opened bank and credit card accounts in the owners’ names. More than $50,000 was reportedly stolen. The Everett woman was arrested in early January on suspicion of 54 felonies following a lengthy investigation by the Everett Police Department’s financial crimes unit. She has since been charged in Everett District Court with identity theft and forgery. Prosecutors are reviewing additional cases involving the woman. In August, an identity-theft victim told police someone had opened a BECU credit card in her name, in addition to other credit card accounts. She had lost $30,000 by that point, according to a probable cause affidavit. The woman made 51 transactions on a credit card registered to the victim over a span of 16 days, police allege in court papers. Records show the woman spent nearly $800 on purses at a Coach outlet store and about $1,160 at a Walmart in Marysville. The transactions do not include the cash that was reportedly withdrawn or transferred into fraudulent accounts. The woman allegedly opened multiple accounts online with BECU under the victim’s name. She claimed she worked for Boeing and earned more than $17,000 a month, according to a probable cause affidavit. Two other people had their personal information stolen, such as their Social Security numbers and birthdates, according to the affidavit. The woman also allegedly obtained someone’s phone number, physical characteristics, driver’s license number, previous addresses, names of relatives and their ages, police said. A financial crimes detective distributed photos around the police department of the woman making a transaction at a BECU location. In December, an Everett police officer was in the McDonald’s parking lot along Colby Avenue when he saw someone in a passing car who matched the woman in the photos. That car was registered in the name of another identity-theft victim, according to the affidavit. The woman sitting in the passenger seat also was wearing the same bracelets and rings as the woman in the photos. At the time of the arrest, the woman was carrying 13 memory cards and two cellphones. The case demonstrates that people need to exercise caution when inviting others to rent their homes, Everett police Sgt. Matt Mekelburg said. “We are continuing to investigate this suspect and expect to find additional information that leads to more victims,” he said in a press release. “It’s unfortunate that victims had their personal information stolen and used for criminal activity. While we understand the concept, we want people to recognize the risks of renting out their homes, and leaving personal information behind.” Caitlin Tompkins: 425-339-3192; ctompkins @heraldnet.com.

Groene’s Education Committee has some controversial issues to deal with, including whether to allow charter schools and whether to allow vouchers to be used to pay for private education. RYAN SODERLIN/THE WORLD-HERALD State Sen. Mike Groene is one of several conservative lawmakers swept into leadership positions this year over Democrats and more moderate Republicans. LINCOLN — State Sen. Mike Groene has led a petition drive to cut school budgets, thinks schools waste too much money on administrators and frills, and believes that parents, not teachers or special interests, should control education. He’s blunt, combative and often harsh, and now he’s sitting in a powerful spot: as chairman of the legislative committee that oversees public education in the state. The head of the Legislature’s Education Committee is a post usually reserved for a former teacher or school administrator, or someone who has served on a local school board, someone viewed as a reliable vote for education. By contrast, Groene, a 61-year-old salesman of agricultural equipment from North Platte, got his start as a critic of spending by his local school district. In 2006 he led a statewide petition drive to limit government spending that was opposed by the state’s teachers union, the Nebraska State Education Association, among others. And now he’s taking heat for a fiery email exchange with a public schools defender two years ago in which he described teachers as “lazy” and “second rate.” Groene is unapologetic, saying the comments were taken out of context. “I’m not a cheerleader. I’m a businessman who wants to improve public education,” Groene said. “Schools can do better.” He is one of several conservative lawmakers swept into leadership positions this year over Democrats and more moderate Republicans. His defenders say there’s nothing wrong with having a fiscal conservative in the top spot of a committee that decides issues related to schools and teachers. “I don’t think it’s a bad idea to have someone approach education from a little bit different perspective, especially when we have a budget shortfall. He focuses on the taxpayers,” said Crete Sen. Laura Ebke, the Legislature’s only Libertarian and a friend of Groene. But critics say that he’s anti-public education and they are angry over a series of emails he exchanged in 2015 with a retired actuary from Hastings. In the emails, Groene wrote that teachers keep their jobs only because of tenure, which protects teachers from being fired without just cause. “Ever since the cowardly draft dodgers of the sixties hid behind education deferments and infested our public education system, our public schools have weakened,” Groene wrote. Citizens need to reclaim education, he added, and if teachers don’t like it, “Walmart is hiring.” At least one Democratic blogger said the comments show that Groene should not even be on the Education Committee, much less run it. Jane Kleeb, the head of the Nebraska Democratic Party, called on Gov. Pete Ricketts to ask Groene to resign. She termed the email comments “disgusting.” “Reading Groene’s emails to voters makes you wonder if he says this in public, how can he be a fair legislator when dealing with school budgets and other critical issues facing our state?” Kleeb said. Ricketts, in comments Friday, said he had not seen the email, but that no matter how people feel about education, “we want to respect our educators” and that conversations should be based on “respect and dignity.” Reaction from Groene’s legislative colleagues runs the gamut, from “stupid” and “disappointing” to this is what sometimes happens when you get into a heated debate via email or over the Internet. “Unfortunately, it’s sometimes not what you say but how you say it,” said Lincoln Sen. Patty Pansing-Brooks, a member of the Education Committee. She added that teachers deserve support and respect. Norfolk Sen. Jim Scheer, the speaker of the Legislature, said he had “a conversation” with Groene after copies of the emails were sent to senators and school superintendents in mid-January. “I think Sen. Groene regrets some of the comments in the terms he made them,” Scheer said. He added that the senator shouldn’t be criticized just because he has different views on the future of education in the state. For his part, Groene said he has nothing to apologize about. The comments were taken out of context, he said, and were meant to condemn only bad teachers. He said that his debating style is to “try to get under the skin of my opponent,” which he did, and that sometimes he pushes that too far. “Basically, if I did anything wrong, I was blunt,” he said. “And that’s what I’m known for.” Later, the senator added, “I say what we all say around the kitchen table. I’m not politically correct. I don’t need to be.” The email exchange came as no surprise to people in North Platte, where Groene has earned a reputation for aggressively opposing school spending proposals and other projects that use tax dollars. He co-founded the Western Nebraska Taxpayers Association, which advocates for cuts in spending and lower taxes. The group went to court to fight the use of tax dollars to build a local tourist attraction, the Golden Spike Tower. Groene and his group also opposed the use of tax increment financing for economic development projects, including a new Menards store, by the city. Such tax breaks benefit one entity while requiring others to foot the tax bills, he said. TIF is more about “urban renewal” than economic growth, Groene maintains. “I believe in tax breaks for everybody or tax breaks for nobody,” he said. A conversation between Groene and Ricketts led to the founding in 2006 of the conservative Platte Institute for Economic Research. Ricketts was the board president; Groene was one of the board members. The senator cut his conservative teeth digging into the budget of the North Platte school district. He objected to spending he considered wasteful or extravagant. One project he fought was buying artificial turf for the high school football field. Groene, who described himself as a “working-class Republican,” said spending needs to be focused on the classroom, not on a “plastic football field” or another layer of administrators. “Some of these things get made because of community vanity,” he said, and not for sound reasons. After unsuccessful campaigns for the Lincoln County Board and the local community college board, Groene decided to run for the Legislature in 2014. He filed just a couple of weeks before the deadline out of frustration after attending a state legislative hearing. He promised his wife he wouldn’t spend more than $2,500 of their money on a campaign. Despite being outspent by a 5-to-1 ratio, he said he won the election by knocking on more doors, talking to more voters. “I went to every neighborhood,” Groene said. But some detractors in North Platte said he was elected to “get him out of town” — a line that Groene himself used during a recent legislative hearing. Critics say he opposes too many community initiatives, uses profanities too often, and tries too hard to provoke people. Former North Platte state senator Tom Hansen, whose wife was a teacher, described Groene as a hard worker who “gets a little intense.” Pansing-Brooks, a current legislative colleague, said she’s nicknamed Groene “Sunshine,” as a reminder to him to lighten up. Groene said he appreciated the nickname, but he enjoys a good, lively debate because it hones one’s debating skills. At his favorite cabin retreat along the South Loup River hangs a sign he had made that reads: “Politics & Religion is the only table talk at this cabin.” But Bert Peterson, a retired actuary from Hastings, said he was shocked at the responses Groene sent to him about a newspaper op-ed piece he’d emailed concerning the correlation between poverty and low educational achievement. The email exchange was in July 2015, but Peterson said when he realized that Groene had been elected chairman of the Education Committee, he shared the emails with every state senator and every school superintendent in the state, as well as others in education. Peterson said they needed to be aware of the senator’s “absolute ignorance of education, and his hateful attitude toward educators.” Groene said that Peterson was a “self-appointed” expert on education and proof of the “arrogance” of those in education toward opposing views. “They believe the educational system is theirs, that it does not belong to the people, and the people are ignorant,” the senator said. Groene said he’s been put “on the hit list” by liberals since the resignation of another outspoken conservative in the State Legislature, former Papillion Sen. Bill Kintner. Not only was Groene’s private email exchange released, Groene said, but a Facebook page that used to detail Kintner’s sometimes inflammatory quotes is now dedicated to Groene. “But I haven’t done anything,” said Groene, who doesn’t use Twitter or Facebook. Observers say there’s always a learning curve for a new committee chair in the Legislature, and Groene appears to be working to become a better listener, including to other points of view. As the leader of the eight-member Education Committee, he’ll have to work to form consensus in a group that appears to be evenly split between moderates and conservatives. The committee has some controversial issues to deal with, including whether to allow charter schools and whether to allow vouchers to be used to pay for private education. Groene said he’s open to those ideas, under certain conditions, but that his big priority is to reduce property taxes by using the state aid to schools process. He said he has changed since the email exchange two years ago. Last year he was in the minority as he led filibusters to derail proposals to provide tax credits for wind farms and require vaccination against meningitis. “I’ve now got a position of power. I can get things done without being an agitator,” the senator said. Officials with the NSEA did not return phone calls seeking comment about Groene, but the organization is supporting one of his bills — one that allows teachers to use physical force if a student becomes unruly or violent. One veteran lobbyist, John Bonaiuto of the Nebraska Association of School Boards, said that while times have changed, Groene is very accessible, as well as very frank. “He’s definitely a conservative, with his own point of view,” Bonaiuto said. “What I have to do is work hard, when we are at odds, that maybe he isn’t seeing the whole picture.” paul.hammel@owh.com, 402-473-9584 +4  Mike Groene RYAN SODERLIN/THE WORLD-HERALD More information 'This is not business as usual': Senators debate budget bill as roughly $900 million shortfall looms The majority of the proposal goes along with recommendations by Gov.

President Donald Trump, accompanied by his daughter Ivanka, waves as they walk to board Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House in Was Source: Associated Press She hosted CEOs at her home to talk policy and used her influence behind the scenes at the White House. These efforts have focused attention on the role Ivanka Trump, 35, expects to play after resigning executive positions with the Trump Organisation and her own lifestyle brand, and moving to Washington. For now, though, it's her husband, Jared Kushner, who is officially working in the administration. "My father will be president, and hopefully, I can be there to support him and to support those causes I've cared about my whole professional career," Ivanka Trump told ABC's "20/20" last month. There are no models for a member of the first family with a prominent policy role on the outside — or for a first daughter with this much influence on the inside. Ivanka Trump has tried to end speculation that she will serve as a fill-in first lady, which has only been heightened by stepmother Melania Trump's decision to continue living in New York City, where son Barron goes to school. Ivanka Trump told "20/20" that "there is one first lady." But joining the president on the Dover trip was the kind of duty that usually would fall to the president's spouse. In Washington, Ivanka Trump has continued her efforts to gather information about workplace policies for women. She hosted a dinner at her home for many of the business leaders attending a White House meeting, including the top executives at Wal-Mart, General Motors and Johnson & Johnson, according to people with knowledge of the event.  Ivanka Trump also weighed, behind the scene, on a policy matter. Along with Kushner, she discouraged a possible executive order that would have affected LGBTQ workplace rights and she supported a White House statement pledging to leave intact a 2014 executive order that protects workers for federal contractors from anti-LGBTQ discrimination, according to a person with knowledge of Ivanka Trump's role in the discussion. Her involvement was first reported by Politico. She drew criticism on social media last weekend when she posted a picture of her and Kushner in formalwear a day after her father announced an executive order barring refugees from certain countries. Nordstrom announced it will stop selling Ivanka Trump clothing and accessories, creating some questions about the future of the brand elsewhere. The Seattle-based department store chain said the decision was based on the sales performance. Last month, Trump said she will take a "formal leave of absence" from her executive positions at the Trump Organization and her company, which will be run by the current president and a board of trustees. no more content back to top loading error refresh LATEST POPULAR FEATURED news 00:15 1 LIVE: Brisbane Global Tens - NZ teams show class after early struggles 04:19 2 As it happened: Farewell Spit whale rescuers sent home after a second day of heart-wrenching efforts 00:16 3 Watch: Cory Jane scores last minute intercept try to complete Hurricanes comeback win 00:15 4 Watch: Liam Messam catches Rebels napping to score first ever Brisbane Tens try 5 Firefighters battle huge blaze in Waikato's Pureora Forest Park 03:04 Video: 'Get it off our whenua' – TeTii marae member in standoff with media over cameras Marae representatives asked police to move TVNZ cameras off a public road. 01:53 'Let's have a shot' - mayors in NZ's poorest regions want power and funds to tackle poverty The idea involves creating special zones in the Far North, Rotorua Lakes and the Gisborne district. 01:52 Northland's big dry: Government offering financial help to drought-stricken farmers One farmer has been forced to sell 60 cows and reckons he'll lose $200k this season. 03:12 'We think iwi are best placed to look after children removed into the state's hands' Maori leaders want new rules in CYF legislation .

Vaugh Corrections center Thursday in Smyrna, Delaware. (Suchat Pederson/The Wilmington News-Journal) Union blames staffing shortage for prison guard’s death Sat Feb 4th, 2017 7:14pm News You must sign in or register to continue reading content. Associated Press SMYRNA, Del. — The killing of a guard during an inmate uprising at Delaware’s largest prison was entirely preventable, according to a correctional officers’ union leader who blamed state officials for ignoring chronic staffing shortages that put prison workers at greater risk. Sgt. Steven Floyd, 47, was found dead early Thursday after a nearly 20-hour hostage standoff at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center near Smyrna. On Friday, he was posthumously awarded a promotion to lieutenant and the Medal of Valor, the department’s highest honor. Floyd was one of four staff members, including a female counselor, taken hostage Wednesday after inmates in a unit holding about 120 inmates ambushed him and forced him into a closet. Inmates released two hostages before a tactical team used a backhoe to breach the building and rescue the woman. “If there had been a correct amount of staffing for a maximum-security building, the inmates would not have been able to overpower the officers, take control of the building and murder Sergeant Floyd,” said Geoff Klopp, president of the Correctional Officers Association of Delaware. “Bottom line is, you cannot run daily operations of that building with three corrections officers safely,” he said. The problem is not unique to Delaware, observers say. For years, many states have struggled to attract and retain correctional officers, largely because they are woefully underpaid, said David Fathi, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Prison Project. “The correction officers are really the backbone of every prison … if you don’t have enough officers, really every aspect of prison operations breaks down,” he said. In some states, prisons are competing for workers with Wal-Mart and McDonald’s, Fathi said. In Nebraska, the state prison has trouble keeping correctional officers because its county jails will pay them much more, he said. Klopp who has worked for the Delaware Department of Correction for 29 years, says he makes about $49,000 annually. A rookie cop in the central Delaware town of Milford starts at $48,000, he said. Authorities have said there are about 90 correctional officer vacancies within Delaware’s prison system on any given day. That’s almost double the 55 correctional officer vacancies reported in fiscal 2010, but less than half of the 260 vacancies in fiscal 2006, according to a Department of Correction annual report. A department spokeswoman said Commissioner Perry Phelps would not comment on staffing until the investigation into this week’s uprising is finished. But the department acknowledged in its most recent annual report that “workforce availability and eminent risk are intimately linked,” and that current staffing levels reflect budgetary restrictions, not adherence to National Institute of Corrections recommended standards. When correctional officer jobs remain vacant, prisons are short staffed for extended periods, the report notes. It adds, “Covering security posts with officers who are unfamiliar with the tasks or post location elevates security risk.” Klopp said one of the two guards taken hostage along with Floyd this week was a rookie, and the other was working overtime and not normally assigned to the building where the uprising occurred. Officers frequently are forced to work overtime to make up for staff shortages. Klopp said overtime pay amounted to about $22 million over the past year. Correctional officers often don’t find out until the end of their shifts that they are being “frozen” to work an additional shift. “They are still forcing people to work overtime to make the facilities run at minimum staffing. They tell you you can’t go home,” Klopp said. “Not having enough staff, not having enough senior staff, and the amount of overtime that we work leads to fatigue and complacency, because we have to work so much to make the facility run,” he added. According to a 2015 annual report, the DOC had 1,710 filled correctional officer positions in fiscal 2015, up from 1,664 the prior year but well short of the 1,796 approved positions. More than a decade ago, a state task force said staff and management were complacent about security at the Smyrna prison. The panel was established in 2004 after a female counselor was held hostage and raped. The inmate who held her was shot to death. Klopp said that, to his knowledge, none of the recommendations made by the task force in 2005 has been implemented. Klopp and state Sen. Bruce Ennis of Smyrna, chairman of the Senate Corrections and Public Safety Committee, said turnover among prison guards averages about a dozen a month. “They can’t train them fast enough,” Ennis said. “When you lose 13 guards a month, it’s kind of hard to keep up.” Most Read Police: Attack by woman near Arlington was fueled by meth ARLINGTON — An Arlington woman is under investigation for assault and unlawful… Feb 10th, 2017 by Scott North Olivia Newton-John show to promote new album in Everett Olivia Newton-John — the movie star (“Grease”) and singer (“I Honestly Love… Feb 10th, 2017 by Gale Fiege Monroe man allegedly schemed to have wife, daughter murdered MONROE — A Monroe man is accused of trying to hire a… Feb 9th, 2017 by Rikki King Fugitive watch Herald staff EVERETT — The state Department of Corrections’ Everett office has… Feb 10th, 2017 by Herald Staff Julie Muhlstein Everett dog owners hope for the best at Westminster show Meet Zoom.

Photo: The New York Times mail print View all comments Tweet By Rukmini Callimachi - - Published: 9:42 AM, February 5, 2017 HYDERABAD (India) — When the Islamic State identified a promising young recruit willing to carry out an attack in one of India’s major tech hubs, the group made sure to arrange everything down to the bullets he needed to kill victims. For 17 months, terrorist operatives guided the recruit, a young engineer named Mohammed Ibrahim Yazdani, through every step of what they planned to be the Islamic State’s first strike on Indian soil. They vetted each new member of the cell as Yazdani recruited helpers. They taught him how to pledge allegiance to the terrorist group and securely send the statement. And from Syria, investigators believe, the group’s virtual plotters organised for the delivery of weapons as well as the precursor chemicals used to make explosives, directing the Indian men to hidden pickup spots. Until just moments before the arrest of the Indian cell, here in June, the Islamic State’s cyberplanners kept in near-constant touch with the men, according to the interrogation records of three of the eight suspects obtained by The New York Times. As officials around the world have faced a confusing barrage of attacks dedicated to the Islamic State, cases like Yazdani’s offer troubling examples of what counterterrorism experts are calling enabled or remote-controlled attacks: violence conceived and guided by operatives in areas controlled by ISIS whose only connection to the would-be attacker is the internet. In the most basic enabled attacks, ISIS handlers acted as confidants and coaches, coaxing recruits to embrace violence. In the Hyderabad plot, among the most involved found so far, the terrorist group reached deep into a country with strict gun laws in order to arrange for pistols and ammunition to be left in a bag swinging from the branches of a tree. For the most part, the operatives who are conceiving and guiding such attacks are doing so from behind a wall of anonymity. When the Hyderabad plotters were arrested last summer, they could not so much as confirm the nationalities of their ISIS interlocutors, let alone describe what they looked like. Because the recruits are instructed to use encrypted messaging applications, the guiding role played by the terrorist group often remains obscured. As a result, remotely guided plots in Europe, Asia and the United States in recent years, including the attack on a community center in Garland, Texas, were initially labelled the work of “lone wolves”, with no operational ties to ISIS, and only later was direct communication with the group discovered. While the trail of many of these plots led back to planners living in Syria, the very nature of the group’s method of remote plotting means there is little dependence on its maintaining a haven there or in Iraq. And visa restrictions and airport security mean little to attackers who strike where they live and no longer have to travel abroad for training. Close examination of both successful and unsuccessful plots carried out in the Islamic State’s name over the past three years indicates that such enabled attacks are making up a growing share of the operations of the group. “They are virtual coaches who are providing guidance and encouragement throughout the process — from radicalisation to recruitment into a specific plot,” said Mr Nathaniel Barr, a terrorism analyst at Valens Global, who along with Mr Daveed Gartenstein-Ross of the Foundation for Defence of Democracies in Washington wrote one of the first articles discussing the virtual plotters. “If you look at the communications between the attackers and the virtual plotters, you will see that there is a direct line of communication to the point where they are egging them on minutes, even seconds, before the individual carries out an attack.” Detailing this kind of plot direction has become a critical focus of counterterrorism officials in the United States and Europe, as they try to track terror planners who pose a lasting threat and to unravel the criminal networks that the group uses as middlemen to facilitate attacks. Yazdani’s case presents one of the most detailed accounts of how ISIS is exporting terrorism virtually. This style of attack has allowed the terrorist group’s reach to stretch into countries as disparate as France and Malaysia, Germany and Indonesia, Bangladesh and Australia. And plots have been discovered in multiple locations in the United States, including in Columbus, Ohio, the suburbs of Washington and upstate New York. “I fear this is the future of ISIS,” said Ms Bridget Moreng, an analyst whose research on the virtual plotters was recently published in Foreign Affairs. A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO Until roughly a year ago, ISIS recruiters aggressively pushed the message that going to Syria was a spiritual obligation. They described the physical journey as a “hijrah”, the Arabic word used to refer to the Prophet Muhammad’s pilgrimage, imbuing the act with religious meaning. The recruiters hid within an ocean of 2.3 billion live social media accounts, flooding the internet with romanticised videos of life inside the caliphate, as well as brutal execution videos, using them as clickbait to lure potential recruits. One of the Islamic State’s most influential recruiters and virtual plotters was known by the nom de guerre Abu Issa al-Amriki, and his Twitter profile instructed newcomers to contact him via the encrypted messaging app Telegram. Among those who sought him out, asking for instructions on how to reach Syria, was Yazdani, who had convinced himself that it was his religious duty to move his family to the caliphate. By 2015, al-Amriki was one of close to a dozen cyberplanners based in Syria or Iraq who were recruiting volunteers abroad, according to a tally based on investigation records from North America, Europe and Asia. Initially, they made little effort to hide, posting grandiose threats against the West on public social media feeds. They were sometimes discounted as mere cheerleaders for the terrorist group. But by late spring 2015, they were considered enough of a threat that both US and British intelligence began tracking their movements, methodically targeting them with airstrikes and killing several since then. Among them was al-Amrik, who was killed along with his wife on April 22 when a bomb flattened their apartment in Al Bab, Syria. The Pentagon press secretary, Peter Cook, identified him as a Sudanese citizen also known as Abu Sa’ad al-Sudani, and described him as one of ISIS’ “external attack planners” who “actively sought to harm Western interests". The Defence Department’s account showed, moreover, that the handler had been involved in far more than just the Hyderabad case, planning attacks on three continents. At the same time that he was recruiting Yazdani, al-Amriki was grooming attackers in Canada and Britain, as well as at least three other young men in suburbs across the United States, according to court records. They included a former member of the Army National Guard living in Virginia; a warehouse worker from Columbus, Ohio; and Emanuel L. Lutchman, a 25-year-old in Rochester, New York. Looking for ways to get to Syria, Lutchman reached out to al-Amriki on Dec. 25, 2015, asking what it was like to live inside territory controlled by the group. “Dream come true,” al-Amriki responded, before telling the young man that the Syrian border had been closed, according to the criminal complaint. Instead, the handler suggested Lutchman carry out an attack right at home on New Year’s Eve — less than a week after their first exchange. Plan an “operation” and kill “1000000s of kuffar”, al-Amriki instructed him, using a derogatory Arabic word meaning infidel. Over the course of several chats via the Telegram service, they planned how Lutchman would attack a bar serving craft beer to celebrate the holiday, prosecutors say. The two men discussed recruiting three other “brothers” to take part. They stayed in contact as Lutchman went to Wal-Mart, where he spent $40 on two ski masks, two knives, a machete, zip-ties, duct tape and latex gloves. He planned to abduct one of the bar’s customers and videotape himself killing the victim, prosecutors say. And they exchanged a flurry of messages, as the 25-year-old began to voice doubts and the handler assumed the role of therapist, patiently listening and reassuring him. Lutchman was arrested at his home the day before his planned attack on Merchants Grill in Rochester, outed by the accomplice he had recruited, who turned out to be an FBI informant. At the time of his arrest, Lutchman had been communicating with the handler for a total of five days. It appears he never heard his handler’s voice, or saw so much as photograph of him, according to the court filings. By late 2015, travel to Syria had become treacherous. Intelligence services on both sides of the Atlantic were getting better at identifying aspiring jihadis, arresting dozens as they prepared to board flights for Istanbul in hopes of crossing into Syria. At first, ISIS operatives instructed recruits to throw off law enforcement by taking more indirect routes. They also began urging followers to head to other ISIS colonies, including in Libya. That was what law enforcement officials said a young man from Columbus, Ohio, Aaron T Daniels, was trying to do in November, when he was arrested while trying to board a United Airlines flight to Houston, from where he would travel to Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, before continuing toward Libya. No longer describing the journey to Syria as a spiritual necessity, ISIS announced last year that those who could not reach the caliphate should attack at home. “If the tyrants have closed in your faces the door of hijrah, then open in their face the door of jihad,” the group’s spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, said in a message released in May. At the time al-Amriki was killed in April, he had been exchanging messages with Yazdani in India for more than a year, patiently offering encouragement as his recruit tried and failed to get a visa first to Greece, and then to Turkey in an effort to reach Syria. One of eight children, Yazdani, 30, grew up in a cramped apartment in the slum of Aman Nagar B, in a narrow alley that smells of sewage in Hyderabad’s Old City. He beat the odds, earning an engineering degree and landing a job as a quality inspector in Saudi Arabia for nearly four years, before returning to India. While abroad, he began watching ISIS online propaganda, and soon he became consumed by a desire to leave it all for the caliphate. “Since then, I was inclined to join Islamic State and work for the cause of religion,” Yazdani told investigators from India’s National Investigation Agency, according to his interrogation record, which was obtained by The Times and was first reported by NDTV, a New Delhi-based television company. He logged into Twitter and searched the hashtags #ISIS and #Khilafa, the terrorist group’s preferred spelling of caliphate. In a few keystrokes, he made contact with al-Amriki. “I created a Telegram ID,” Yazdani told investigators, “and sought his guidance to reach Syria.” After months of frustrating and failed attempts to help Yazdani get a visa, al-Amriki’s directions changed course: “He asked me to work for IS by staying in India itself.” It was a period in which ISIS was refining the way it exports terror, increasingly relying on cyberplanners with local knowledge. Just before his death, al-Amriki handed off Yazdani to a different handler, known only by his Telegram screen name, “WindsofVictory”. His identity has not yet been confirmed by Indian officials, though they believe he is Indian because he spoke fluent Hindi. The new handler guided the eight-member cell as it took shape, exchanging messages with Yazdani as the engineer recruited his family members and friends. They named themselves “Jund-ul-Khilafa-Fi-Bilad-Hind”, the Army of the Caliphate in India, according to the interrogation records, which misspelled part of the Arabic name. At the end of May, Yazdani received a message telling him to go to the Nanded Airport, about 200 miles away. He and an accomplice, Habeeb Mohammed, 31, drove all night. After they reached the airport the next morning, the handler told them to head to the Railway Division Office. Near that office, he said, they would see a plastic bag hanging from a tree, according to the transcripts of the men’s interrogations. "It was informed by the handler that opposite to DRM office, there are two trees and on one of the trees there would be a white colour polyethylene sheet (used for wrapping fragile articles),” Mohammed told investigators. “We spotted the place, and I, first on the pretext of urinating, went to check for the consignment." When they opened the bag, they found two pistols and 20 bullets, according to their account to law enforcement. It was one of at least four drops the handler set up for them. Because the pistols were rusted, they say the handler instructed them to travel to the railway station in the city of Ajmer, about 600 miles to the north. This time they were told to bring 65,000 rupees — around S$1,363 — and leave it near the railway track sealed in a plastic bag, which would be picked up and used as payment for weapons. Because the communication always had to go through the handler, the members of the Hyderabad cell never directly interacted with the arms seller. When they were arrested, they could not provide any clues as to who had left the contraband, Indian investigators said. The Hindi-speaking handler guiding the men in Hyderabad also insisted on using a kaleidoscope of encrypted messaging applications, with Yazdani instructed to hop between apps so that even if one message history was discovered and cracked, it would reveal only a portion of their handiwork. As soon as Yazdani indicated he was willing to undertake an attack, the handler instructed him to download ChatSecure, a messaging app to be used when they spoke by phone. When he used his laptop, he was told to contact the handler via Pidgin, another encrypted tool. He was told to create an account with Tutanota, a secure email service. And the handler taught Yazdani how to use the Tails operating system, which is contained on a USB stick and allows a user to boot up a computer from the external device and use it without leaving a trace on the hard drive. Once that system was in place, the handler told Yazdani to prepare a handwritten oath of allegiance, known as a “bayah”, to ISIS’ leader. Members of the cell signed it using their noms de guerre, and Yazdani was told to scan it to his laptop, using Tails to obscure the operation. Next, he was told to upload it to gulf-up.com, which allows users to upload files and produces a URL that can be shared with a third party. The link to the URL was to be sent via the secure email. By methodically working through URLs archived on the website, The Times was able to find the image of the one-page handwritten document containing the Indian men’s pledge of allegiance to ISIS. The file was uploaded around the time Yazdani told investigators he had done so, and the document matched his description of the wording he had disclosed to the authorities. Until they were alerted to its existence, Indian investigators were not aware that the document was still archived on the website, they said. The men’s families have denied that they played any role in a terrorist plot, and accuse the authorities of planting evidence against them. One Indian investigator, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief reporters, said officials were able to crack the full extent of the case only because Yazdani and his accomplices confessed during interrogation, divulging the passwords to their accounts after their arrests last summer. GLOBAL REACH Though the Hyderabad case is among the most detailed in showing how Syria-based handlers directly facilitated terrorist attacks abroad, it is neither the first, nor the only one. Investigation documents from Europe show that a growing share of attacks bear signs of contact with the ISIS stronghold, even though the attacker was initially described as acting alone. The first time officials in Europe described an attack as having been “télécommandé”, or remote-controlled, was in spring 2015 after a young information technology student named Sid Ahmed Ghlam tried to open fire on a church in the Paris suburb of Villejuif. Instead, he shot himself in the leg. When the police searched his car, they found his Lenovo laptop containing a series of messages showing how he, too, had been guided by a pair of handlers who provided both the weapons and the getaway car, according to hundreds of pages of police and intelligence records obtained by The Times. “OK, brother, now pay attention,” one of the messages begins, instructing the then-23-year-old to head to the suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois, where he would find the automatic weapons in a bag left in a locked car parked near a sandwich shop. “Search among the cars that are parked there near the big road and look for a Renault Mégane,” the message said. “Look at the front right tire — you’ll find the keys placed on top.” The handler then instructed him to store the weapons in another car in a parking garage 10 miles away, a precaution in case his apartment was searched. Later, French investigators said they had found that Ghlam’s handlers were French citizens who had traveled to Syria to join ISIS. They, in turn, tapped their criminal network back in France to arrange the logistics of Ghlam’s plot. Mr Seamus Hughes, deputy director of the Programme on Extremism at George Washington University, said the handlers were essentially “quarterbacking” the attack: “They’re from there, so they can essentially tell someone, ‘OK, go 10 yards and go this way.’” Wiretaps, interrogation records and transcripts of chats recovered on suspects’ phones and laptops show that this level of guidance has occurred all over the world. In Germany, a man who set off a bomb outside a concert and a teenager who assaulted train passengers with an ax were both chatting with handlers until minutes before their attacks. The teenager’s handler urged him to use a car instead of an ax — “The damage would be much greater,” the handler advised — but the young man said he did not have a driving permit. “I want to enter paradise tonight,” he said, according to a transcript obtained by a German newspaper. In northern France, a pair of attackers who had been guided by an Islamic State cybercoach slit the throat of an 85-year-old priest. The pair had not known each other, and according to the investigative file, the handler introduced them, organising for them to meet days before the attack. Intelligence records obtained by The Times reveal that the same handler in Syria also guided a group of young women who tried to blow up a car in front of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris. And investigations into attacks in Malaysia, Indonesia and Bangladesh reveal that the recruits were directly communicating with Islamic State handlers who moulded the plots as they took shape and helped arrange logistics, in some cases wiring money. In several investigations, a pattern has emerged: The attacker initially tries to reach Syria, but is either blocked by the authorities in the home country or else turned back from the border. Under the instructions of a handler in Syria or Iraq, the person then begins planning an attack at home. Law enforcement officials describe that sequence of events in one of the most recent foiled attacks in France, where a group of people are accused of plotting to hit the popular Christmas market in Strasbourg, having been given the GPS coordinates of a location to pick up weapons. At least one of the five men arrested had been turned back from Turkey, French prosecutors said. WEAK LINKS While a reliance on local amateurs has allowed ISIS to announce that it can stage terrorism around the world, it has also led to many failed attacks. Instead of opening fire on a church, Ghlam shot himself in the leg. Instead of laying waste to a music festival this past summer, the ISIS recruit in Germany detonated his bomb prematurely, killing only himself. The same thing happened the day before the end of Ramadan on July 2 inside a police compound in Indonesia, where another remotely guided attacker hit the switch on his crudely assembled suicide vest. “He didn’t even knock over the flowerpot on the ledge next to where he blew himself up,” said Sidney Jones, director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict. Indonesian officials say the suicide bomber had been incited to attack by Bahrun Naim, a 33-year-old Indonesian man who is one of the Islamic State’s most prolific cyberplanners, operating from the group’s capital in Raqqa, Syria. Initially, Naim wired money to families in Indonesia to pay for travel to Syria, officials said. Later, the bank transfers he sent were to be used to buy the chemicals needed to build explosives, according to the interrogation records of his recruits. In just over a year, the young men with whom he was in touch attempted at least six attacks, targeting a police post, a Buddhist temple and a church, as well as foreigners visiting the country. In November, a college dropout who the police said had at least been initially in contact with Naim was arrested as he prepared to attack the Myanmar Embassy. In his home, the police recovered a quantity of explosives that could have resulted in a blast twice as powerful as the 2002 Bali bombing, which killed 202 people, the police spokesman told local news media. Yet nearly all of the plots attributed to Naim have failed. And it was human error that finally led to the arrest of al-Amriki’s followers in Hyderabad. The plot began to unravel in June after the men were instructed to collect a 10kg bag of ammonium nitrate left beside a canal next to mile marker No 9 on the Vijayawada Highway. They returned to Mohammed’s home to begin preparing a bomb, but could not figure out how to replicate the steps in the instructional YouTube video sent to them by the handler. “We could not succeed in making powder, as it became jellylike paste,” Yazdani lamented, according to the transcript of his interrogation. They tried using a tea strainer. They tried heating it longer. They began talking on their cellphones about their efforts to “cook the rice”. By then, the police were wiretapping their calls and suspected that all the food talk was a crude attempt at misdirection. Early on June 29, the police banged on the door of Mohammed’s home. In his bedroom, they found the half-cooked explosive in his refrigerator.

As officials around the world have faced a confusing barrage of attacks dedicated to the Islamic State, cases like Yazdani's offer troubling examples of what counterterrorism experts are calling enabled or remote-controlled attacks: violence conceived and guided by operatives in areas controlled by ISIS whose only connection to the would-be attacker is the internet. In the most basic enabled attacks, ISIS handlers acted as confidants and coaches, coaxing recruits to embrace violence. In the Hyderabad plot, among the most involved found so far, the terrorist group reached deep into a country with strict gun laws in order to arrange for pistols and ammunition to be left in a bag swinging from the branches of a tree. For the most part, the operatives who are conceiving and guiding such attacks are doing so from behind a wall of anonymity. When the Hyderabad plotters were arrested last summer, they could not so much as confirm the nationalities of their ISIS interlocutors, let alone describe what they looked like. Because the recruits are instructed to use encrypted messaging applications, the guiding role played by the terrorist group often remains obscured. As a result, remotely guided plots in Europe, Asia and the United States in recent years, including the attack on a community center in Garland, Texas, were initially labeled the work of "lone wolves," with no operational ties to ISIS, and only later was direct communication with the group discovered. While the trail of many of these plots led back to planners living in Syria, the very nature of the group's method of remote plotting means there is little dependence on its maintaining a haven there or in Iraq. And visa restrictions and airport security mean little to attackers who strike where they live and no longer have to travel abroad for training. Close examination of both successful and unsuccessful plots carried out in the Islamic State's name over the past three years indicates that such enabled attacks are making up a growing share of the operations of the group. "They are virtual coaches who are providing guidance and encouragement throughout the process - from radicalisation to recruitment into a specific plot," said Nathaniel Barr, a terrorism analyst at Valens Global, who along with Daveed Gartenstein-Ross of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington wrote one of the first articles discussing the virtual plotters. "If you look at the communications between the attackers and the virtual plotters, you will see that there is a direct line of communication to the point where they are egging them on minutes, even seconds, before the individual carries out an attack." Detailing this kind of plot direction has become a critical focus of counterterrorism officials in the United States and Europe, as they try to track terror planners who pose a lasting threat and to unravel the criminal networks that the group uses as middlemen to facilitate attacks. Yazdani's case presents one of the most detailed accounts of how ISIS is exporting terrorism virtually. This style of attack has allowed the terrorist group's reach to stretch into countries as disparate as France and Malaysia, Germany and Indonesia, Bangladesh and Australia. And plots have been discovered in multiple locations in the United States, including in Columbus, Ohio, the suburbs of Washington and upstate New York. "I fear this is the future of ISIS," said Bridget Moreng, an analyst whose research on the virtual plotters was recently published in Foreign Affairs. A Diverse Portfolio Until roughly a year ago, ISIS recruiters aggressively pushed the message that going to Syria was a spiritual obligation. They described the physical journey as a "hijrah," the Arabic word used to refer to the Prophet Muhammad's pilgrimage, imbuing the act with religious meaning. The recruiters hid within an ocean of 2.3 billion live social media accounts, flooding the internet with romanticised videos of life inside the caliphate, as well as brutal execution videos, using them as clickbait to lure potential recruits. One of the ISIS's most influential recruiters and virtual plotters was known by the nom de guerre Abu Issa al-Amriki, and his Twitter profile instructed newcomers to contact him via the encrypted messaging app Telegram. Among those who sought him out, asking for instructions on how to reach Syria, was Yazdani, who had convinced himself that it was his religious duty to move his family to the caliphate. By 2015, al-Amriki was one of close to a dozen cyberplanners based in Syria or Iraq who were recruiting volunteers abroad, according to a tally based on investigation records from North America, Europe and Asia. Initially, they made little effort to hide, posting grandiose threats against the West on public social media feeds. They were sometimes discounted as mere cheerleaders for the terrorist group. But by late spring 2015, they were considered enough of a threat that both U.S. and British intelligence began tracking their movements, methodically targeting them with airstrikes and killing several since then. Among them was al-Amrik, who was killed along with his wife on April 22 when a bomb flattened their apartment in Al Bab, Syria. The Pentagon press secretary, Peter Cook, identified him as a Sudanese citizen also known as Abu Sa'ad al-Sudani, and described him as one of ISIS' "external attack planners" who "actively sought to harm Western interests." The Defence Department's account showed, moreover, that the handler had been involved in far more than just the Hyderabad case, planning attacks on three continents. At the same time that he was recruiting Yazdani, al-Amriki was grooming attackers in Canada and Britain, as well as at least three other young men in suburbs across the United States, according to court records. They included a former member of the Army National Guard living in Virginia; a warehouse worker from Columbus, Ohio; and Emanuel L. Lutchman, a 25-year-old in Rochester, New York. Looking for ways to get to Syria, Lutchman reached out to al-Amriki on Dec. 25, 2015, asking what it was like to live inside territory controlled by the group. "Dream come true," al-Amriki responded, before telling the young man that the Syrian border had been closed, according to the criminal complaint. Instead, the handler suggested Lutchman carry out an attack right at home on New Year's Eve - less than a week after their first exchange. Plan an "operation" and kill "1000000s of kuffar," al-Amriki instructed him, using a derogatory Arabic word meaning infidel. Over the course of several chats via the Telegram service, they planned how Lutchman would attack a bar serving craft beer to celebrate the holiday, prosecutors say. The two men discussed recruiting three other "brothers" to take part. They stayed in contact as Lutchman went to Wal-Mart, where he spent $40 on two ski masks, two knives, a machete, zip-ties, duct tape and latex gloves. He planned to abduct one of the bar's customers and videotape himself killing the victim, prosecutors say. And they exchanged a flurry of messages, as the 25-year-old began to voice doubts and the handler assumed the role of therapist, patiently listening and reassuring him. Lutchman was arrested at his home the day before his planned attack on Merchants Grill in Rochester, outed by the accomplice he had recruited, who turned out to be an FBI informant. At the time of his arrest, Lutchman had been communicating with the handler for a total of five days. It appears he never heard his handler's voice, or saw so much as photograph of him, according to the court filings. By late 2015, travel to Syria had become treacherous. Intelligence services on both sides of the Atlantic were getting better at identifying aspiring jihadis, arresting dozens as they prepared to board flights for Istanbul in hopes of crossing into Syria. At first, ISIS operatives instructed recruits to throw off law enforcement by taking more indirect routes. They also began urging followers to head to other ISIS colonies, including in Libya. That was what law enforcement officials said a young man from Columbus, Ohio, Aaron T. Daniels, was trying to do in November, when he was arrested while trying to board a United Airlines flight to Houston, from where he would travel to Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, before continuing toward Libya. No longer describing the journey to Syria as a spiritual necessity, ISIS announced last year that those who could not reach the caliphate should attack at home. "If the tyrants have closed in your faces the door of hijrah, then open in their face the door of jihad," the group's spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, said in a message released in May. - Local Assets At the time al-Amriki was killed in April, he had been exchanging messages with Yazdani in India for more than a year, patiently offering encouragement as his recruit tried and failed to get a visa first to Greece, and then to Turkey in an effort to reach Syria. One of eight children, Yazdani, 30, grew up in a cramped apartment in the slum of Aman Nagar B, in a narrow alley that smells of sewage in Hyderabad's Old City. He beat the odds, earning an engineering degree and landing a job as a quality inspector in Saudi Arabia for nearly four years, before returning to India. While abroad, he began watching ISIS online propaganda, and soon he became consumed by a desire to leave it all for the caliphate. "Since then, I was inclined to join Islamic State and work for the cause of religion," Yazdani told investigators from India's National Investigation Agency, according to his interrogation record, which was obtained by The Times and was first reported by NDTV, a New Delhi-based television company. He logged into Twitter and searched the hashtags #ISIS and #Khilafa, the terrorist group's preferred spelling of caliphate. In a few keystrokes, he made contact with al-Amriki. "I created a Telegram ID," Yazdani told investigators, "and sought his guidance to reach Syria." After months of frustrating and failed attempts to help Yazdani get a visa, al-Amriki's directions changed course: "He asked me to work for ISIS by staying in India itself." It was a period in which ISIS was refining the way it exports terror, increasingly relying on cyberplanners with local knowledge. Just before his death, al-Amriki handed off Yazdani to a different handler, known only by his Telegram screen name, "WindsofVictory." His identity has not yet been confirmed by Indian officials, though they believe he is Indian because he spoke fluent Hindi. The new handler guided the eight-member cell as it took shape, exchanging messages with Yazdani as the engineer recruited his family members and friends. They named themselves "Jund-ul-Khilafa-Fi-Bilad-Hind," the Army of the Caliphate in India, according to the interrogation records, which misspelled part of the Arabic name. At the end of May, Yazdani received a message telling him to go to the Nanded Airport, about 200 miles away. He and an accomplice, Habeeb Mohammed, 31, drove all night. After they reached the airport the next morning, the handler told them to head to the Railway Division Office. Near that office, he said, they would see a plastic bag hanging from a tree, according to the transcripts of the men's interrogations. "It was informed by the handler that opposite to DRM office, there are two trees and on one of the trees there would be a white color polyethylene sheet (used for wrapping fragile articles)," Mohammed told investigators. "We spotted the place, and I, first on the pretext of urinating, went to check for the consignment." When they opened the bag, they found two pistols and 20 bullets, according to their account to law enforcement. It was one of at least four drops the handler set up for them. Because the pistols were rusted, they say the handler instructed them to travel to the railway station in the city of Ajmer, about 600 miles to the north. This time they were told to bring 65,000 rupees - around $1,000 - and leave it near the railway track sealed in a plastic bag, which would be picked up and used as payment for weapons. Because the communication always had to go through the handler, the members of the Hyderabad cell never directly interacted with the arms seller. When they were arrested, they could not provide any clues as to who had left the contraband, Indian investigators said. The Hindi-speaking handler guiding the men in Hyderabad also insisted on using a kaleidoscope of encrypted messaging applications, with Yazdani instructed to hop between apps so that even if one message history was discovered and cracked, it would reveal only a portion of their handiwork. As soon as Yazdani indicated he was willing to undertake an attack, the handler instructed him to download ChatSecure, a messaging app to be used when they spoke by phone. When he used his laptop, he was told to contact the handler via Pidgin, another encrypted tool. He was told to create an account with Tutanota, a secure email service. And the handler taught Yazdani how to use the Tails operating system, which is contained on a USB stick and allows a user to boot up a computer from the external device and use it without leaving a trace on the hard drive. Once that system was in place, the handler told Yazdani to prepare a handwritten oath of allegiance, known as a "bayah," to ISIS' leader. Members of the cell signed it using their noms de guerre, and Yazdani was told to scan it to his laptop, using Tails to obscure the operation. Next, he was told to upload it to gulf-up.com, which allows users to upload files and produces a URL that can be shared with a third party. The link to the URL was to be sent via the secure email. By methodically working through URLs archived on the website, The Times was able to find the image of the one-page handwritten document containing the Indian men's pledge of allegiance to ISIS. The file was uploaded around the time Yazdani told investigators he had done so, and the document matched his description of the wording he had disclosed to the authorities. Until they were alerted to its existence, Indian investigators were not aware that the document was still archived on the website, they said. The men's families have denied that they played any role in a terrorist plot, and accuse the authorities of planting evidence against them. One Indian investigator, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters, said officials were able to crack the full extent of the case only because Yazdani and his accomplices confessed during interrogation, divulging the passwords to their accounts after their arrests last summer. - Global Reach Though the Hyderabad case is among the most detailed in showing how Syria-based handlers directly facilitated terrorist attacks abroad, it is neither the first, nor the only one. Investigation documents from Europe show that a growing share of attacks bear signs of contact with the ISIS stronghold, even though the attacker was initially described as acting alone. The first time officials in Europe described an attack as having been "télécommandé," or remote-controlled, was in spring 2015 after a young information technology student named Sid Ahmed Ghlam tried to open fire on a church in the Paris suburb of Villejuif. Instead, he shot himself in the leg. When the police searched his car, they found his Lenovo laptop containing a series of messages showing how he, too, had been guided by a pair of handlers who provided both the weapons and the getaway car, according to hundreds of pages of police and intelligence records obtained by The Times. "OK, brother, now pay attention," one of the messages begins, instructing the then-23-year-old to head to the suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois, where he would find the automatic weapons in a bag left in a locked car parked near a sandwich shop. "Search among the cars that are parked there near the big road and look for a Renault Mégane," the message said. "Look at the front right tire - you'll find the keys placed on top." The handler then instructed him to store the weapons in another car in a parking garage 10 miles away, a precaution in case his apartment was searched. Later, French investigators said they had found that Ghlam's handlers were French citizens who had traveled to Syria to join ISIS. They, in turn, tapped their criminal network back in France to arrange the logistics of Ghlam's plot. Seamus Hughes, deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the handlers were essentially "quarterbacking" the attack: "They're from there, so they can essentially tell someone, 'OK, go 10 yards and go this way." Wiretaps, interrogation records and transcripts of chats recovered on suspects' phones and laptops show that this level of guidance has occurred all over the world. In Germany, a man who set off a bomb outside a concert and a teenager who assaulted train passengers with an ax were both chatting with handlers until minutes before their attacks. The teenager's handler urged him to use a car instead of an ax - "The damage would be much greater," the handler advised - but the young man said he did not have a driving permit. "I want to enter paradise tonight," he said, according to a transcript obtained by a German newspaper. In northern France, a pair of attackers who had been guided by an Islamic State cybercoach slit the throat of an 85-year-old priest. The pair had not known each other, and according to the investigative file, the handler introduced them, organizing for them to meet days before the attack. Intelligence records obtained by The Times reveal that the same handler in Syria also guided a group of young women who tried to blow up a car in front of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris. And investigations into attacks in Malaysia, Indonesia and Bangladesh reveal that the recruits were directly communicating with ISIS handlers who molded the plots as they took shape and helped arrange logistics, in some cases wiring money. In several investigations, a pattern has emerged: The attacker initially tries to reach Syria, but is either blocked by the authorities in the home country or else turned back from the border. Under the instructions of a handler in Syria or Iraq, the person then begins planning an attack at home. Law enforcement officials describe that sequence of events in one of the most recent foiled attacks in France, where a group of people are accused of plotting to hit the popular Christmas market in Strasbourg, having been given the GPS coordinates of a location to pick up weapons. At least one of the five men arrested had been turned back from Turkey, French prosecutors said. Weak Links While a reliance on local amateurs has allowed ISIS to announce that it can stage terrorism around the world, it has also led to many failed attacks. Instead of opening fire on a church, Ghlam shot himself in the leg. Instead of laying waste to a music festival this past summer, the ISIS recruit in Germany detonated his bomb prematurely, killing only himself. The same thing happened the day before the end of Ramadan on July 2 inside a police compound in Indonesia, where another remotely guided attacker hit the switch on his crudely assembled suicide vest. "He didn't even knock over the flowerpot on the ledge next to where he blew himself up," said Sidney Jones, director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict. Indonesian officials say the suicide bomber had been incited to attack by Bahrun Naim, a 33-year-old Indonesian man who is one of the Islamic State's most prolific cyberplanners, operating from the group's capital in Raqqa, Syria. Initially, Naim wired money to families in Indonesia to pay for travel to Syria, officials said. Later, the bank transfers he sent were to be used to buy the chemicals needed to build explosives, according to the interrogation records of his recruits. In just over a year, the young men with whom he was in touch attempted at least six attacks, targeting a police post, a Buddhist temple and a church, as well as foreigners visiting the country. In November, a college dropout who the police said had at least been initially in contact with Naim was arrested as he prepared to attack the Myanmar Embassy. In his home, the police recovered a quantity of explosives that could have resulted in a blast twice as powerful as the 2002 Bali bombing, which killed 202 people, the police spokesman told local news media. Yet nearly all of the plots attributed to Naim have failed. And it was human error that finally led to the arrest of al-Amriki's followers in Hyderabad. The plot began to unravel in June after the men were instructed to collect a 10-kilogram bag of ammonium nitrate left beside a canal next to mile marker No. 9 on the Vijayawada Highway. They returned to Mohammed's home to begin preparing a bomb, but could not figure out how to replicate the steps in the instructional YouTube video sent to them by the handler. "We could not succeed in making powder, as it became jellylike paste," Yazdani lamented, according to the transcript of his interrogation. They tried using a tea strainer. They tried heating it longer. They began talking on their cellphones about their efforts to "cook the rice." By then, the police were wiretapping their calls and suspected that all the food talk was a crude attempt at misdirection. Early on June 29, the police banged on the door of Mohammed's home. In his bedroom, they found the half-cooked explosive in his refrigerator.

ADVERTISEMENT Furthermore, while we don’t know yet whether Trump will follow through with this threat, his abandonment of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in his first few days in office is an indication that he is not shying away from his campaign pledges.   Trump is now entering uncharted waters. He has already demonstrated his ignorance of Asian affairs when he publicly accepted a phone call from Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, in December before announcing that he didn’t understand the “One China” policy, or why he should respect it. His abandonment of the TPP will simply accelerate China’s displacement of America as the world’s leading economic power. For the moment, China has decided to wait for the U.S. to make the first move. A trade war would be problematic for the region, not least for Southeast Asia, which would likely suffer negative fallout as a major trade partner to both the U.S. and to China. But it would not be a disaster for China, mainly because the U.S. needs China more than China needs the U.S.  Unfortunately for Trump, it’s no longer the 1980s. Twenty years ago, the situation might have been different. China was dramatically underdeveloped, and it wanted access to Western technology and manufacturing techniques. China has most of what it needs now, and what it doesn’t have it can easily obtain from vendors outside of the U.S. While the American market looked enticing a few decades ago, it is relatively mature, and, today, the newer emerging market countries have become much more enticing to Beijing. The fastest growing markets for the best items China produces, like laptops and cellphones, are in developing regions, such as India, Latin America, and Africa. In contrast, China itself is a market that the U.S. can hardly ignore. By the end of 2015, Chinese consumers had bought 131 million iPhones. The total sales to U.S. customers during the same period stood at only 110 million, and the iPhone makes up just a small portion of U.S. exports. Boeing, which employs 150,000 workers in the U.S., estimates that China will buy some 6,810 airplanes over the next 20 years, and that market alone will be worth more than $1 trillion. Were Trump to start a trade war, the most immediate effects would probably be felt by companies like Walmart, which imports billions of dollars of cheap goods that are bought mostly by the people who voted Trump into office. The prices on almost all of these items would quickly skyrocket beyond the reach of the lower economic brackets, not because of manufacturing costs, but because of the tariffs. The result would be an economic war of attrition that China is infinitely better positioned to win. China’s foreign currency reserves now stand at more than $3 trillion. In contrast, the U.S. has foreign exchange reserves that hover at roughly $120 billion. Trump’s tariffs would automatically trigger penalties against the U.S. in the World Trade Organization (WTO). It might even lead to the WTO’s collapse, which would lead to higher tariffs against U.S. exports. While it might take a while for that to happen, the turmoil would be catastrophic for American business and employment. China, on the other hand, would emerge relatively unscathed. In fact, the importance of the U.S.-China relationship is already being challenged by other players. Apple’s iPhone sales in China are running into competition from local Chinese manufacturers, and Samsung is more than happy to fill any void that the Chinese can’t deal with. Likewise, the Chinese would happily shift their trillion dollars in future aircraft purchases to Airbus, a European firm that is already building a plant in China, to finish assembly of large, twin-aisle jets. As for automobiles, most Chinese would just as soon drive a Mercedes, BMW, or Lexus as a Ford. Both China and leading economic experts hope that a trade war won’t happen. The American political system is relatively mature, complete with checks and balances, but with a president who often acts uniquely based on his own beliefs regarding complex issues, almost anything is possible.   Professor Winter Nie is the regional director of Southeast Asia and Oceania for the International IMD business school.   The views of contributors are their own and not the views of The Hill.

When work is visually displayed, it simplifies the workload and the progress for software development teams. These cards serve as a trigger for the next step. When it comes to software development, the visual board may display columns showing the work to do, in development, being tested, and complete. The number of status columns, as well as the contents, will vary greatly depending on the industry, project type, or nature of the deliverables. SEE: IT leader's guide to Agile development (Tech Pro Research ebook) The history of the Kanban framework It was first discovered back in the 1940s by an industrial engineer at Toyota named Taiichi Ohno who was looking for ways to improve efficiency in the manufacturing process.

This was done to reduce excess inventory and is known as just-in-time (JIT) inventory. Today this is used by many retail businesses and manufacturers including Walmart. Kanban's basic guiding principles The work to be done and the workflow is displayed visually. The remaining work in process should be limited. There should be a focus on the workflow. There should be a focus on continuous improvement. All deliverables should be 100% defect free. The benefits of Kanban Because it focuses on continuous improvement, it's likely that teams will continually yield high-quality results. Due to the focus on continuous improvement, productivity and efficiency are likely to increase while reducing unnecessary waste, whether that's time or resources. Teams are more likely to accomplish goals much easier due to the visual nature of Kanban boards or cards. The ultimate benefit of Kanban is passed on to the customer through a higher-quality product or service at a cost-effective price due to the decrease in waste. Who uses Kanban? Kanban is highly versatile in its application and is used within various industries, including the following and more: IT Software and video game development Lean manufacturing Media As-a-service providers Financial Real estate The future of Kanban This framework for continuous improvement with a simplified model makes it a favorite within many industries. Since it offers many benefits without a rigid process or formal team guidelines, Kanban may outlast many other frameworks. Kanban is a tried-and-true tested approach in the Agile PM world and shows that sometimes simple really is best. For more project management tips, subscribe to our Executive Briefing newsletter.

Rob LeFebvre, @roblef 02.06.17 in Food and Drink Comments 598 Shares Share Tweet Share Save You might see even more smart cooking gadgets at your favorite retail outlet soon thanks to industry giant Electrolux's purchase of popular sous vide maker Anova.The $250 million acquisition allows the smaller company to continue as a brand with Electrolux's resources and reach. Anova makes a connected, wand-like gadget that perches on the side of a pot. As you cook the food in a sealed bag in a water bath, the wand keeps the temperature stable as long as needed. Proponents of this recently-revived slow-cooking style claim that it makes perfectly-cooked food that tastes amazing, while critics downplay the results. The newfangled connected devices, like those made by Anova, let you range a little farther from your kitchen while the meal takes its sweet time to finish. You can already purchase an Anova sous vide system from places like Amazon, Best Buy and Target, but you might start seeing them at even more big chains like Walmart, Sears and Bed, Bath and Beyond. Don't be surprised to see prices drop below the $99 entry point and into impulse-buy territory. The power of a big appliance company goes beyond distribution channels and economies of scale, though. Electrolux promises to help Anova bring more kitchen gadgets to life, creating an entire kitchen full of smart, easy to use devices to fill your home with like Anova's smart oven coming later this year. If you haven't had a chance to slowly cook your food in a bag for hours on end, your time is coming. With the joy of sous vide capturing the attention of massive appliance manufacturers like Electrolux, even non-foodies might pick one up.

Det. Clark Thompson said Randy Jason Cox, 42, was arrested Sunday on two counts of first degree theft by deception. He is out on $100,000 bond. Police said their investigation began when a woman from Los Angeles County, Calif., called to report three purchases at a Gadsden jewelry store totaling more than $11,000. Police eventually traced the activity to Cox, Thompson said, discovering 16 debit and credit cards mailed to his house that he used over the last year. The scam involved Cox making purchases using the cards, then sending the purchases to Nigeria and keeping some funds for himself. Police said Cox made transactions totaling more than $165,000 over the course of a year. The purchases involved victims in several states, including New York and Chicago. On one occasion, Thompson said Cox purchased $3,700 worth of iTunes gift cards from Walmart. The scam also involved using equity lines of credit, "cloned" credit cards and fraudulent ATM cash withdrawals. Gadsden police say a man purchased $3,700 worth of iTunes cards using stolen credit information. William Thornton / wthornton@al.com  "We had a lot of data to go through," Thompson said. "He was averaging $12,000 to 18,000 on every card." In all, the case took about 200 man hours to close. Police recovered bad checks, stolen personal information, and credit card scanners which can be used with cell phones. This is the fourth scam investigators have worked with this kind of approach in a relatively short period of time, Thompson said. An outside party mails the credit cards and information to a buyer, who makes purchases and keeps some funds. The purchases are then mailed out of the country. The purchaser will then say they did not know the purchases were illegal, Thompson said. The person supplying the cards lives outside the country, the purchases are made in states away from the victims and prosecution can span several states. "If somebody mails you credit cards with no names, asking you to use them, it's a felony if you use them," he said. "Social media makes it easier for these things to happen."

Fiji Time: 9:38 PM on Saturday 11 February Home Politics Local Sport World Letters Editorial Nai Lalakai Business Features Classifieds Weather Gallery Archives / Front page / Business Vision, mission important Chris Elphick Tuesday, February 07, 2017 Businesses, especially very small, small and medium sized businesses are the lifeblood of the Pacific. They provide for our needs, employ our people, energise our communities, help us fulfil our potential and provide a future for our young people. Businesses have the power to transform our world one step at a time. Business leaders have a responsibility to use that power wisely, ethically and responsibly. During this short series of articles Chris Elphick looks at the transformational power of business. Today the focus is on vision and mission — how inspirational is yours? It has long been understood that businesses need a vision and mission but there is often lack of clarity about what it is and who it is for! A vision statement provides strategic direction and describes what the owners want the company to achieve in the future - what impact is it going to make in the world. A mission statement describes an organisation's purpose and answers the questions "What business are we in?" and "What is our business for?" A vision is something you want to become, to achieve, it is a seductive image of an ideal future — whereas a mission explains the purpose of the organisation — why it exists — it captures the organisation's soul. They should link closely together and some organisations will have just one statement that captures both. If you have a set of business values then they should also relate closely. Many organisations have statements of their vision, mission and values on the wall, often in a nicely designed plaque! I wonder why we do that and what is the real value of these statements. To be meaningful vision, mission and values need to be in daily use and be in the hearts and minds of our teams. A vision/ mission statement should be no more than one-sentence describing the clear and inspirational long-term desired change resulting from an organisation's work. The best visions are inspirational, clear, memorable, and concise. Here are a few examples from the not-for-profit world: * Oxfam: A just world without poverty; * Human Rights Campaign: Equality for everyone; * National Multiple Sclerosis Society: A World Free of MS; Alzheimer's Association: Our vision is a world without Alzheimer's; * Habitat for Humanity: A world where everyone has a decent place to live; Oceana seeks to make our oceans as rich, healthy and abundant as they once were. Here are a few more from some well know international companies: * Nike: "Bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world. If you have a body, you are an athlete." * Walmart: "We save people money so they can live better." * 3M "To Improve Every Life through Innovative Giving in Education, Community and the Environment." * Coca Cola: "To refresh the worldâ€¦To inspire moments of optimism and happinessâ€¦To create value and make a difference." * Microsoft: "To enable people and businesses throughout the world to realise their full potential." * Google: "To organise the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful." It is important not to get too worried about the difference between vision, mission and values! What is important is that to be an inspirational business we need to inspire people and of course we don't do that by our words but by our actions. Engage your staff in developing your vision and mission — make sure it is meaningful to them and that they believe it! Engage your customers, suppliers and other stakeholders — is it meaningful and believable to them? Keep it alive — discuss it at team meetings, use it to promote the business and to recruit staff, create vision related projects that are helpful to your staff and your local community. Develop a reputation as a value-led business that cares about its staff, its customers, its community and its environment — this is good business sense and it makes a real difference to the world in which you operate. Recent research shows that businesses with relevant and inspirational visions attract the best talent and bring in more customers! * Coming next — part three of our Going for Gold series — planning that works. * Chris Elphick is director of Learn.fast Pacific, supporting the development of a range of businesses and organisations in Vanuatu, Fiji, Solomons and other Pacific countries.

But on a 16-mile stretch of Interstate 85 in southwestern Georgia, renamed the Ray C. Anderson Memorial Highway, the asphalt isn’t just a reminder. It’s a living laboratory helping advance the ideas of an industrial and environmental pioneer. This out-of-the-way section of interstate, now known as The Ray, offers a vision of how highways could look and function in the future. Drivers crossing the border from Alabama will see photovoltaic arrays rising above a rest stop, part of a sustainable electric vehicle charging station. Solar paving material underfoot, developed by a French company called Colas, has turned a small section of the visitor’s center into a testing ground for solar roadway technology. In the next few years, the addition of solar panels, sustainable landscaping, and Internet of Things technology will make this a smart, sustainable—and most important to its backers, revenue-generating—road to a greener future. Rendering of what the proposed solar array would look like built into the Ray The Ray Highways have never been the sexiest infrastructure projects, but Allie Kelly, the executive director of The Ray, believes that preconception will shift dramatically over the next few years due to rapid technological shifts. With politicians in Washington discussing the administration’s ambitious infrastructure plans, now is the time to make investments in our transportation system. As far as Kelly is concerned, that vision should focus on achieving zero deaths, zero carbon, and zero waste. She hopes The Ray can serve as the laboratory where new ideas and revenue models are tried, tested, and proven possible. “We’re at a tipping point in transportation,” says Kelly. “In five to ten years, we won’t remember a time when we invested a dime in infrastructure spending for a road that only did one thing.” The new Wattway installation on the Ray, a solar generating paving surface that will help generate power along the roadway The Ray The Ray’s origins come from a simple observation that a memorial roadway should make its namesake proud. In the case of a highway named after the late Ray Anderson, that means both smart and sustainable. A pioneering green industrialist from Georgia, Anderson is most famous for the way he built Interface, a massive multinational carpeting manufacturer that has been an industry leader in cutting pollution and reducing the use of petroleum. The company is more than halfway towards its Mission Zero goal to reduce any negative environmental impact by 2020, and Ralph Nader, not exactly a friend of corporate America, has championed Anderson’s commitment to the environment. After a portion of I-85 was named for Anderson posthumously in 2014, his family members, who were in the process of figuring out the best way to utilize the endowment of the Ray C. Anderson Foundation, felt it wasn’t the best way to honor his legacy. “We put the name of one of the century’s greenest industrialists on a dirty highway,” says Harriet Anderson Langford, his daughter and president of The Ray, which is funded in large part by the Ray C. Anderson Foundation. “It made us ask ourselves, ‘how can we transform the transportation system?’” The family and foundation decided the best solution was creating a living legacy project. To start, a partnership between the Ray C. Anderson Foundation, Interface, the Georgia Conservancy, and Georgia Tech’s School of Architecture conducted a roadway study to determine the state of local highways, and what could be done to transform an industrial transportation corridor that runs between warehouses and plants for companies such as Walmart and Kia. The proposed electric charging lane on The Ray The Ray The telling results suggested highways have a long way to go to meet Anderson’s strict standards. The financial and environmental tolls of our road system can be staggering. Each year, $277 billion is lost in this country due to vehicle crashes, and roadways damage natural habitats on 15 percent of the country’s land. On just this 16-mile stretch of road, more than 5 million tons of CO2 is emitted every year. Initially, the vision for The Ray was to add a solar installation in the median, along with a wildflower garden, to remind drivers about the environmental costs of the transportation system. But the results of the study suggested a more dramatic plan was needed. Since then, The Ray, in concert with the Georgia Department of Transportation, has slowly rolled out a number of new initiatives to improve both safety and sustainability. In 2015, a new electric charging station powered in part by photovoltaic panels, a joint project with funding from Kia Motors, became the first in the state. This past year, the Ray added a strip of Wattway solar panels to an entrance ramp, and installed a WheelWright tire pressure sensor at a rest stop right next to the Alabama state line. The new British device helps drivers quickly test and maintain proper tire pressure, a leading cause of crashes. Over the next year, the foundation plans to add more new tests that will help build out a more holistic roadway. A one megawatt solar installation will be installed in a right-of-way as part of a joint effort with Georgia Power to turn the highway into a place for power generation, and a series of bioswales—landscaped drainage ditches that naturally filter pollution—will turn the areas adjacent to the highway into more clean, sustainable, and natural landscapes. “We’re pushing the idea that these kind of installations can become widespread energy generation system for state departments of transportation,” says Kelly. “Highways can eventually make money, and even serve as a power grid for the future.” Kelly doesn’t just see the Ray’s role as a testing ground for exciting new technologies. It’s a proving ground for smart investment, one of many that have sprung up across the country and around the world to rethink how highways can be more than just roads. The team behind the Solar Roadways system has a handful of pilots operating across the country, California is looking to test a kinetic highway power system that generates energy from vehicle movement, and many municipalities are trying out different variations on electric and smart road solutions. “We have to prove there are benefits here to the investor,” says Kelly. “Our role is to catalyze change, so to do that, you need to focus on everything. We don’t have to just talk about low or zero emissions, we can talk about revenue.

But Trump’s economic plan — which resonated most with voters and arguably won him the election — is fading as a priority amid the usual infighting in Washington. Trump’s agenda for his first 100 days includes new legislation to cut taxes, repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and fund a big infrastructure program, plus a reworking of the North American Free Trade Agreement. But all of those plans are hitting hurdles, in Congress and elsewhere, and it could take much longer to enact them than Trump has promised. Some may never go into effect. Trump has been in office for less than a month, and nobody expected him to pass complicated legislation in a matter of days. But after Trump won last November, stocks surged on the expectation of quick action, especially with regard to tax cuts. Now, as Congressional Republicans try to turn Trump’s campaign promises into actual laws, disagreement among GOP factions and obstruction by Democrats augur a much slower pace of action than markets may have anticipated. Some investors are now lowering their expectations for business-friendly new policies that will goose the economy, and exiting the so-called Trump trade. The promise of tax cuts, friendlier regulation and stimulus spending on infrastructure sent stocks soaring after the election, and if those measures don’t materialize in 2017, markets may give back the gains. Here’s the outlook for Trump’s four biggest economic initiatives: Tax cuts With Republicans controlling the White House and both chambers of Congress, the stars seem to have aligned in favor of tax reform that lowers rates, closes loopholes and makes the US economy more competitive. There’s one pitfall, however: If lost revenue from tax cuts isn’t offset by spending cuts, annual deficits will soar, something Republican budget hawks aren’t willing to allow. One prominent plan would offset lost revenue through new taxes on imports, but that has already triggered opposition from big US companies like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT), along with consumer groups that say ordinary Americans will bear the cost of import taxes. Trump said in a recent interview that tax cuts might pass Congress by the end of the year. But that may be optimistic. “The big story here is the glacial Senate, already bogged down in bitter infighting,” Greg Valliere, chief global strategist for Horizon Investments, wrote recently to clients. “The economic impact of tax reform may not hit until well into 2018.” Tax cuts might also be more modest than Trump would like, if Republicans can’t agree on how to make up for lost revenue. ACA repeal Congress has made this a legislative priority, but after six years of trying to kill the ACA, Republicans still haven’t unveiled a plan to replace it. And some key Republicans, such as Senators Orrin Hatch of Utah and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, now say “repairing” Obamacare, as the ACA is known, might be better than repealing it. Before taking office, Trump said he’d have a replacement plan ready as soon as his nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, was confirmed for the job. But now Trump says the “rudiments” of a replacement plan won’t be ready until the end of the year, with legislation unlikely before 2018. The fate of the ACA probably won’t impact financial markets broadly, but it will directly affect healthcare sectors such as the pharmaceutical industry, hospitals, insurers and medical device makers. There’s also the nagging question of how to provide health care coverage for the 20 million people covered under Obamacare, without costing the government more or forcing more of a financial burden onto patients. If you had to solve this riddle, you’d get bogged down, too. Infrastructure spending Trump wants to spend an astounding $1 trillion on new roads, bridges and the like, but his plan would rely primarily on private funding — which would only materialize for projects funded by tolls or other user fees. That’s a non-starter for most roads and bridges. And there’s very little appetite in Congress for spending billions of taxpayer dollars on new projects, which would drive the national debt even higher. A robust infrastructure plan would help economic growth, but this is another policy that’s easy to prescribe and devilishly hard to fulfill. NAFTA revocation This is one thing Trump could do relatively quickly, on his own — if he’s willing to risk the possible economic damage. But undoing NAFTA would throw the auto industry into turmoil, while possibly raising the price of cars, appliances, toys, produce and many other things millions of Americans buy every month. Trump says higher prices for imports would eventually create more US manufacturing jobs. But many economists disagree, and even if Trump is right, it would take years for new jobs to arrive. Meanwhile, Trump may be bluffing on his threat to withdraw from NAFTA, as a negotiating tactic. We ought to know within a couple of months, as top trade advisors such as Wilbur Ross, Trump’s nominee for Commerce Secretary, assume their posts and begin to show their hand. Trump is making better progress on a few more targeted initiatives, most notably his plan to ease restrictions on banks. That has already fueled a pop in financial-industry stocks such as Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS). And Trump has cleared the way for a couple of oil pipelines his predecessor, President Barack Obama, had squashed. When it comes to legislation, though, it turns out even united government can’t escape gridlock. For the overall economy, the Trump bump is still a theory.

Skip to content People Style News Fashion Beauty Shopping Giveaways Style Ivanka Trump Isn't the Only Celebrity Whose Fashion Line Has Been Dropped Due to Controversy By Emily Kirkpatrick•@kirkpate Updated February 6, 2017 at 4:07pm EST Share Tweet Email Pinterest Ida Mae Astute/ABC via Getty The future of Ivanka Trump‘s fashion empire may be in jeopardy, as her brand continues to vanish from retailer websites at the same time that Trump continues to work with the White House alongside her father’s administration. It was announced late last week that Nordstrom would no longer be carrying the brand in stores or online, and it appears that Neiman Marcus has also followed suit, removing more than a dozen accessories and jewelry from their website. Now, it seems as though Macy’s might be the next to distance themselves from the first family, as consumers participating in the #GrabYourWallet movement turn their focus on the remaining retailers carrying her brand; her line has disappeared from Belk’s website over the weekend as well, though all of the aforementioned companies, save for Nordstrom, have yet to release an official statement on the matter. And while it may seem like Ivanka’s being uniquely targeted by these boycotts, as it turns out she’s hardly the first celebrity entrepreneur to lose distribution due to massive public outcry. In fact, her father and now President of the United States, Donald J. Trump had a similar experience with Macy’s in 2015, when, as a candidate for president, Trump said “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best… They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” In a November interview with The Street, the company’s CEO Terry Lundgren said Macy’s has no regrets about their choice, concluding,”We made our decision about a year and a half ago, and stand by our decision.” Likewise, after Martha Stewart‘s trial and conviction on charges of insider trading, Viacom dropped her television show and she chose to resign from the board of directors at her namesake brand in the hopes that it could be sustained under new leadership. A few years later her home goods brand came under fire again, albeit this time for very different reasons, with Macy’s suing both her line’s parent company and J.C. Penney for what they believed to be a violation of their exclusive contract with Stewart, causing J.C. Penney to drop the products altogether rather than face an expensive lawsuit and court time. While most people now think of Kathie Lee Gifford as one half of the wine-sipping, fourth-hour Today show duo, in the midst of the ’90s she was also involved in a sweatshop scandal. In 1996, it was revealed that dresses from her $300 million clothing line sold at Walmart were being sewn by Honduran child laborers. Controversy reared again in 1999 when two former factory employees from the brand’s El Salvador factory said they were fired after speaking up for workers’ rights, describing 11-hour, six-day work weeks making a minimum wage of 60 cents an hour. Needless to say, the line of apparel was quickly disbanded and Gifford has pledged her life to the dismantling of sweatshops. Paula Deen‘s brand also took a serious hit after the celebrity chef admitted during a deposition to having used the N-word and companies quickly dropped her extensive line of products which range from holiday hams to cookbooks, including Sears, K-mart, J.C. Penney, and Walgreen’s. At the time, it was estimated that the fallout from the trial would cost Deen millions of dollars in revenue, but since then she seems to have bounced back slightly, even launching her own clothing line.

Business Retail Analyst: Costco among retailers most vulnerable to import-tax proposal Originally published February 6, 2017 at 11:57 am Updated February 6, 2017 at 7:25 pm A cart full of organic produce at Costco in Issaquah. (Bettina Hansen/The Seattle Times) An analyst says Costco is among the five companies that would be most affected under the border-adjustment tax proposed by leading House Republicans. Share story By Janet I. Tu Seattle Times business reporter Costco could be hurt big by an import-tax plan being proposed by the GOP, according to investment bank Jefferies. The border-adjustment tax, proposed by House Republicans, is meant to encourage companies to buy domestically, to manufacture in the U.S. and to export. Their plan would lower the corporate income-tax rate and exclude export profits from taxation. But companies would no longer be able to deduct the cost of imported goods when they are calculating the profits they are taxed on. President Trump initially called the plan “too complicated.”But then his administration seemed to support at least part of it, floating the idea of having Mexico pay for a border wall with a 20 percent tax on products imported from there.

Costco is among the top five companies covered by Jefferies whose earnings would be most dramatically impacted by the GOP tax plan, “due to their relatively high level of imports,” Daniel Binder, an analyst with Jefferies, wrote in a note to investors Monday. Costco is also particularly vulnerable because of its low margins, Binder said. Retailers including Dollar General and Bed Bath & Beyond could benefit from the proposal, Binder writes. Binder cautioned that his analysis doesn’t take into account currency fluctuations, inflation and other market factors such as price increases by retailers, so it’s not exactly what is likely to happen. But it’s a way “to try and better understand relative sensitivity among retailers to a tax such as this,” he wrote. Costco President and CEO Craig Jelinek briefly talked about the issue at last month’s annual meeting when asked by a shareholder what the company would tell its members to do if prices go up in reaction to higher import taxes. “We’ll just have to wait and see how it goes and if we want to educate our customers and if we want to lobby,” Jelinek said. “I don’t know that we have enough information on this to give sound direction at this time.” Last month, an RBC Capital Markets analyst estimated that six large U.S. retailers, including Costco, could take an earnings hit totaling $13 billion under the border-adjustment tax, according to The Wall Street Journal. Many large retailers, including Wal-Mart and Target, and trade groups have formed a coalition, Americans for Affordable Products, to fight the GOP proposal, saying it could lead to higher prices of as much as 20 percent on everyday items such as clothing, food and gas. Costco is not on the list of coalition members and has declined to comment on whether it will join. Several other companies, including Boeing, General Electric and Dow Chemical, have formed the American Made Coalition in support of the proposed tax plan. They say the plan would level the playing field for American-made goods and discourage companies from locating overseas for tax purposes.

Last month dozens of leading global brands endorsed a plan to ensure 70 percent of plastic packaging is reused and recycled globally, up from today’s recycling rate of 14 percent. They include Coca-Cola, Danone, Dow Chemical, L’Oreal, Marks & Spencer, Mars, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble and Unilever. The plan to achieve a 70 percent plastic packaging recycling rate is laid out in a new report, The New Plastics Economy: Catalysing action, by the World Economic Forum and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The report recommends companies “actively explore” replacing polystyrene (PS), expanded polystyrene (EPS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as packaging materials. This year, As You Sow filed a shareholder proposal with McDonald’s, which phased out foam beverage cups in the US but continues to use it in foreign markets. Dunkin’ Brands has committed to phase out foam cups, but has not yet done so, the nonprofit says. It also filed similar resolutions with Amazon and Target, and says it is in dialogue with Walmart, which uses polystyrene foam as packing material in its e-commerce operations. The proposals urge the companies to assess the environmental impacts of continued use and to develop a timeline for phase out. “We are aware of the campaign and are in the process of evaluating, but don’t have additional details to share at this time,” Target spokesperson Angie Thompson said in an email. The other three companies did not respond to requests for comment. More than 100 US cities or counties have already banned or restricted foam packaging and Ikea and Dell are among the companies to being phasing out foam packaging in their e-commerce operations. Ikea, however, has drawn sharp criticism from the plastics industry for phasing out foam and replacing it with fiber-based packaging. Ikea said it had replaced all EPS foam in its packaging “with recyclable and more sustainable alternatives.” In a joint statement the US-based EPS Industry Alliance and the Belgium-based European Manufacturers of EPS accused Ikea of greenwashing and said the retail giant “merely relied on the public perception that paper is uniformly a superior environmental choice.” Categories WasteTags Amazon, As You Sow, Dell, IKEA, McDonald's, Plastics, polystyrene, rwrr, shareholder resolutions, Sustainable Packaging & Paper, Target, Walmart Leave a Comment Cancel reply NEWSLETTER NEWSLETTER SIGNUP Join 100,000+ subscribers who gain a competitive advantage with our news and analysis.

Whole Foods WFM, -0.03%   shares have an average hold rating with a $29.67 price target, 0.4% lower than Friday’s close of $29.80. Here’s what to expect: Earnings: Analysts polled by FactSet forecast earnings per share of 39 cents, down from 46 cents last year. Estimize, a software platform that crowdsources estimates from buy-side analysts, hedge-fund managers and others, sees EPS of 41 cents. Revenue: FactSet analysts and Estimize see sales of $4.98 billion for the quarter, up from $4.83 billion for the same period last year. Whole Foods has missed the FactSet sales estimate for the last three quarters. Share price: Whole Foods shares are down 0.5% for the past year, and up 1.1% for the past three months. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.36%   is up 23.8% for the last 12 months. Other issues: J.P. Morgan presented three “bull cases” for Whole Foods in a food producers and retailers report published a couple of weeks ago. See also: Whole Foods to close 3 kitchens, outsource some ready-to-eat meals In the first, the company has cut more than $150 million in costs, introduced the low-cost 365 store, and took other steps in line with the nine-point plan the company laid out in Nov. 2015. In the second, the company will become more “tactical and effective” with its promotions and price investments. The company’s “Whole Paycheck” reputation is one that has stuck around despite its efforts. And in the third, a lower tax rate of 20% could lead to about 25% in earnings accretion. Still, analysts believe it’s too soon to say declare the company’s efforts a victory. “Though Whole Foods seems to be making progress on many of its announced initiatives, at this point it is a bit too early to tell if these actions will reverse sales trends and drive higher earnings growth,” analysts said. J.P. Morgan rates Whole Foods shares neutral with a $31 price target.

The surging demand for whiskey in the U.S. has led to a boom in craft distilleries opening up across the country. In addition to the 365 stores, Whole Foods opened a new store in Midtown Manhattan on Jan. 28 that features a variety of prepared foods and restaurant options, among other attributes. The store also highlights efficiency in a way they haven’t seen previously, Oppenheimer said, for instance, with kiosks that allow customers to order and pay for food at the same time. And the location, across the street from Bryant Park, is seen as “an attractive advertising vehicle” with “heavy pedestrian traffic throughout all parts of the day” and, perhaps contrary to the company’s efforts, higher price points than another Manhattan location at Columbus Circle, across from Central Park. “This store, along with the 365 location in Silver Lake, CA, are reminders of the chain’s ability to innovate against an increasingly crowded grocery backdrop,” analysts said in a note published last Monday. See also: Chipotle continues on rocky path as earnings slide In an earlier note from Jan. 18, Oppenheimer analysts forecast that same-store sales will likely stay in negative territory for now due to challenges like competitor and deflationary pressure, but they’re optimistic about the company further down the line. “Over time, we would expect company efforts to facilitate a return to positive comp growth that are currently being masked by heightened competitive and disinflationary pressures,” Oppenheimer wrote. Analysts rate Whole Foods share outperform with a $35 price target. Macquarie Research analysts are also bearish about the same-store sales outcome for this quarter, but they see reasons to be upbeat about the future. “While the near-term will remain difficult, we view Whole Foods as a differentiated, best-in-class operator wand will stabilize both comparable store sales and margins,” they wrote in a note published Friday. “We remain confident that the management team will ultimately reposition the company, as they have done in the past, and 365 could ultimately prove a concept to capture value-oriented, mainstream growth.” Macquarie rates Whole Foods shares outperform with a $38 price target.

Robert Jourdain, 22, of the first block of North Fourth Street, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit third-degree murder, for the crime spree committed July 5, 2015, in Easton and Allentown. Jourdain is set to be sentenced March 27. Under the deal, his minimum sentence is capped at 12 years, and he faces a maximum sentence of 40 years in state prison. First Assistant District Attorney Steve Luksa said he plans to seek the maximum of 40 years. Friends and family of the victims -- Kory Ketrow, Francine E. Ramos and Trevor D. Gray -- were in the courtroom audience for the hearing, which lasted longer than an hour, but did not make statements. They do plan to speak at Jourdain's sentencing hearing, Luksa said, and they agreed to the terms of his plea deal. "They're hoping by resolving this, it will continue to bring closure to them," Luksa said in court. The gunman, Todd West of Elizabeth, N.J., was charged with seven killings in all -- the three in the Lehigh Valley and four before that in New Jersey. West previously admitted to randomly gunning down Ketrow in Easton, and Ramos and Gray in Allentown. Outrage at murderer's words: 'I just wanted to kill them' In exchange for West's guilty plea to three counts of first-degree murder, prosecutors dropped the death penalty. West was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences without the chance of parole. Jourdain bought a 50-count box of .38-caliber bullets at about 2:30 a.m. July 5 at a Lower Nazareth Township Wal-Mart. There is no evidence Jourdain was threatened by West to purchase the ammunition West ultimately used, prosecutors said. Under the plea deal, Jourdain did not admit he knew West was going to kill someone that night and there is no evidence Jourdain knew about West's alleged prior shootings in New Jersey. A half-hour after the ammunition was purchased, Ketrow was shot by West. By 4 a.m., Allentown police would find Ramos and Gray gunned down at Sixth and Greenleaf streets. West has said he chose the victims at random. The alleged getaway driver, Kareem Mitchell, is still awaiting trial in his case in Lehigh County. A trial date is slated for April 26. Mitchell, of Newark, previously told investigators that the night of July 4, 2015, he was giving Jourdain a ride with his 2-year-old son to Easton, and West, whom he had never met before, came with them. Prosecutors said Jourdain and West knew each other. After dropping off the child, the trio went to Allentown so West could get a haircut, then went to an after-hours club, according to police. MORE: Easton man charged with two others in Allentown murders After purchasing the ammunition, the trio was driving in Easton, when West spotted Ketrow. West told investigators Ketrow looked tired as he was walking along Lehigh Street, and that he was going to "help" Ketrow. After killing Ketrow, West opened fire at a Palmer Township woman stopped at a traffic light at Third and Spring Garden streets in Easton. West hit Helene Barone's car as she sped away, but Barone and her passenger escaped uninjured. As for his Allentown victims, at his plea hearing West said he killed the pair because "I just wanted to kill them." Mitchell drove the Mercedes SUV the entire night, until it was disabled by a damaged wheel. Eventually, Mitchell parked the damaged SUV in Allentown, bought a bus ticket back to northern New Jersey and walked around Allentown with the other two before taking a bus back home. Police said West and Jourdain then robbed three men in separate incidents in Allentown, injuring two of the victims. The pair were arrested after an Allentown officer saw them near North Morris and West Washington streets wearing clothes similar to those of two armed robbery suspects, police said. Investigators found a bag with 18 .38-caliber casings and the box of the remaining ammunition.  The families of West's victims are suing Wal-Mart, claiming the employees in Lower Nazareth Township failed to confirm if Jourdain was at least 21 years old when he went to buy the bullets. Jourdain was 20 at the time. Walmart has argued in court that the .38-caiber ammunition can be used in rifles, and rifle ammunition can be sold to customers who are 18 or older.

According to Mint.com, the average woman will spend $15,000 on makeup in her lifetime. The U.S. has the largest cosmetics market in the world. Cleveland 19 News Splurge or save? It's what most women think about when purchasing beauty essentials. But even the beauty bloggers and experts will tell you, beauty doesn't have to mean extra banknotes. Celebrity makeup artist Francine Grassi said the beauty industry has evolved and there are options. "Nowadays there's an overabundance of everything from inexpensive to expensive and nobody ever knows what they should buy," said Grassi. The makeup maven has been beautifying faces for more than 20 years -- Cyndi Lauper, Weird Al Yankovich, Michael Bolton, former President Barack Obama, and Katie Couric, just to name a few. She uses products from the drugstore and the department store and she never skimps on facial products. "I think skincare is probably the most important thing to anybody because every artist wants to have a nice clean canvas and if you could get that canvas perfected, that's probably the best thing you could do," said Grassi. Here's one of her beauty secrets: You won't need as much makeup. Splurge on: Brushes Foundation Nail polish topcoats Eyeliner Save on: Mascara Brow powder Eyebrow pencils Bronzer Lip gloss Grassi said that's what she splurges and saves on, but every makeup wearer has their own preference. Many are looking for ways to cut costs, even some of the recognizable Cleveland 19 news faces. Cleveland 19 News Romona Robinson "I get asked a lot about my makeup and I mix and match cheap stuff with expensive brands but the color I'm asked about most often is Milani. It's two lipsticks and a lip liner. These cost about $7 or $8 versus the MAC lipsticks which are about $20 said main Anchor Romona Robinson. Tia Ewing Morning anchor Tia Ewing said when it comes to her face, she mixes it up. "This is my low-end foundation. I also have a high-end foundation that I use. It will cost me about $8.99 at Walmart and it's a Milani concealer and foundation in one and it gives you long-wear," said Ewing. Tiffani Tucker Tiffani Tucker has a few must-have products for removing makeup. "I like to use simple baby wipes, really easy, you just kind of wipe that make-up off your face, you can toss it out when you're done, it's a little easy to take off your makeup but you just don't stop there. Dial antibacterial body wash, face wash, that's what I use on my face, all over my body because you want to get that extra makeup and gook off of your face at the end of the night," said Tucker. Grassi said the best advice is to appreciate what's already there: that doesn't cost a thing. "I think beauty starts within so when you get yourself feeling a little bit better, that makes you look better and it's not about the products but how you feel about yourself," said Grassi.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Tue, Feb 07, 2017 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp US companies must navigate a minefield AFP, WASHINGTON Starbucks Corp has promised to hire 10,000 refugees. US President Donald Trump’s supporters have called for a boycott, while Uber Technologies Inc has allegedly taken advantage of Trump’s anti-immigration decree to drum up business, leading users to unsubscribe from the app en masse. Trump’s election has laid bare the deep divisions of American society, a discord that has forced many businesses to walk a fine line to avoid alienating consumers. “Companies that were working very hard to stay neutral no longer can,” brand expert Bruce Turkel said. “The biggest problem is anything they say can be misinterpreted.” Sportswear manufacturer New Balance, for instance, found itself embroiled in controversy after its chief executive officer Matt LeBretton voiced optimism following the election. “We feel things are going to move in the right direction,” he said in an interview, prompting outrage on Twitter, where users called for a massive boycott of the sneaker company, forcing the brand into damage control. “From the people who make our shoes to the people who wear them, we believe in acting with the utmost integrity and we welcome all walks of life,” the company said. Beverage giant PepsiCo Inc faced similar backlash from the opposite camp. Two days after the election, the company’s chief executive officer Indra Nooyi said her employees “were all in mourning.” “And the question that they’re asking, especially those who are not white: Are we safe?” she said. The retaliation came instantly: “It’s probably a good time to pass on the Pepsi products,” conservative site The Gateway Pundit wrote. Calls for boycotts often proliferate on Internet forums such as Reddit and 4Chan, as well as social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Others originate from more structured protests. The Grab Your Wallet site, launched in October last year, lists companies suspected of favoring Trump, either because their leaders contributed to the real-estate billionaire’s campaign or because they do business with the Trump family. The long “boycott” list includes the department store Macy’s Inc, retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc and beer brand Yuengling. “Brands have always been political, but now consumers can see more of this activity and are making decisions based on this information,” site cofounder Shannon Coulter said. However, the impact of boycott campaigns is difficult to evaluate, because calls to blacklist specific companies tend to get lost in the frenzy of social media. “Consumers have an incredibly short memory,” marketing expert Merry Carole Powers said. Still, some companies fear losing customers by staying silent. Nordstrom Inc, a chain of department stores, recently announced it would drop the Ivanka Trump clothing line belonging to the president’s eldest daughter. “There’s no margin in the middle,” said Turkel, who wrote the book All About Them, focused on company branding. “If you stay quiet, you get nothing out of it. You have to figure out who your audience is and what are their values.” Uber appears to be playing it by ear as it devises its strategy. The company first distanced itself from Trump’s executive order temporarily barring refugees and travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, but it then came under fire for allegedly taking advantage of a New York taxi driver protest against the ban, prompting a wave of unsubscriptions. As taxi drivers went on strike refusing to pick up passengers at John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York, Uber not only continued to operate, but also dropped its surge pricing. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 2258 times. Comments will be moderated.

“No warning can save people determined to grow suddenly rich” – Lord Overstone Home Articles Authors Search About Us HOME / Articles / Michael Pento / Carnage of the Middle Class Carnage of the Middle Class By: Michael Pento | Mon, Feb 6, 2017 Share Print Email In President Donald J. Trump's inaugural address he promised, "This American carnage stops right here and stops right now." And immediately liberals and the MSM took umbrage to his use of the word carnage, which means the slaughter of a large number of people, claiming it was just too dark a description for America. Maybe so. However, in a recent Bloomberg commentary, Justin Fox cites some sobering statistics that support Trump's statement. While the overall murder rate for the nation should end up increasing about 8% year-over-year, the surge within U.S. cities is absolutely staggering. Chicago suffered a 59% increase in homicides during 2016. Murders were up 56% in Memphis, 61% in San Antonio, 44% in Louisville, 36% in Phoenix and 31% in Las Vegas. There were also 44,193 suicides in the U.S. in 2015, with the percent increase in suicides rising the most for females aged 10–14, and for males aged 45–64. The suicide rate has risen 24% over the past 15 years and is the highest recorded rate in 28 years. But it isn't just violent crime that has exploded recently in the U.S.: an incredible 52,404 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2015. More than double the amount experienced in 2002. These morbid truths reveal the crux of this election. While Washington and the media elites were busy gloating about a falling unemployment rate, the overlooked carnage lay in plain sight. But it wasn't just the disturbing rise of unnatural deaths. If liberal elites ever bothered to land in flyover country they would have easily found another type of carnage…the evisceration of the middle-class. There are two reasons for this decline. The first is a result of the Federal Reserve's money printing that forced $3.8 trillion into the canyons of Wall Street, leaving just crumbs for the people on Main Street to feed upon. The Federal Reserve's money flowed mostly into stocks, bonds and real estate, creating asset bubbles and inflation for the rich to enjoy. While the middle class--who don't own nearly as many assets and spend much more of their disposable income on energy, food and shelter—became even poorer. The second is America's huge and persistent current account and trade deficits.  The current account deficit was $500 billion, and the trade deficit was $762 billion for 2015. The sad truth is that we haven't had a trade surplus since Nixon closed the gold window back in 1971. Unlike what most pundits like to argue, the money that is lost through our current account deficit and returns to us as a capital account surplus, is not merely an innocuous transaction. The so called capital account surplus is really just the transfer to foreign ownership of U.S. equities, real estate and bonds; driving them into unsustainable bubbles and making the rich even richer. But that's not the worst of it. That deficit is the result of high-paying manufacturing jobs leaving this country and turning the middle-class factory worker into a minimum wage Wall Mart greeter. In 1970, more than a quarter of U.S. employees worked in the manufacturing sector. By 2010, only one in 10 did. Therein lies the nucleus of the trade deficit and the demise of the middle class. But the middle class rout is not solely a result of companies moving plants overseas--often a company doesn't have to move locations to get cheap labor.  In October of 2015, Disney, the self-proclaimed happiest place on earth, didn't make 250 of their U.S. employees very happy when they replaced them with immigrants on temporary visas. This transaction was facilitated by an outsourcing firm based in India. And Disney is not the alone; similar "outsourcings" have happened across the country. Businesses have been misusing temporary worker permits, known as H-1B visas, to place immigrants willing to work for less money in technology jobs based in the United States. These visas are intended for foreigners with advanced science or computer skills to fill specific positions only when a similar skilled American worker cannot be found. But legal loopholes have allowed companies to circumvent the requirement to recruit American workers first and that guarantee capable American workers will not be displaced. American blue and white collar workers have good reason to fear that globalization will result in the slow extinction of the middle class; setting the United States on a dystopic course where a small group of wealthy elite reign over a large class of workers without benefits, pensions, job security or a living wage. This is the unrecognized pain that sat below the frequently-touted government data points on employment and GDP. And it is the carnage of the middle class that has abetted the dissolution of the American family, which in turn as led to the surge in homicides, suicides and drug overdoses in the United States. Washington and media elites have failed to listen to the forgotten man for decades. Normalizing interest rates and enforcing fair trade agreements are absolutely mandatory for a middle class renaissance to take place. Even though the transition will be incredibly painful, it appears there is finally someone in the White House who will begin to address these issues. The hope and prayer is that he will have the courage to see it through.     Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Gregg Greenberg Feb 6, 2017 11:25 AM EST President Donald Trump will eventually figure out that trade wars hurt everybody, so don't sell your retail or emerging markets stocks as a result of his tariff talk, says Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. If Trump were to carry through on his threatened 45% tariffs on imported goods from China, the price of a wide variety of products on the shelves of Walmart (WMT) would rise within days. Rising prices, in turn, lead to inflation and lower standards of living. That's why Wilbur Ross, the incoming Secretary of Commerce, has referred to tariffs as a negotiating tool -- a starting point rather than an ending point -- in trade negotiations, said Clemons.

Posted Feb 6, 2017 by Mark Suster (@msuster), Chang Xu (@_changxu) 0 SHARES Next Story Hardware Battlefield winner CubeSensors is reborn as Klevio Mark Suster Crunch Network Contributor Mark Suster is the managing partner at Upfront Ventures, the leading Los Angeles-based venture firm. How to join the network It was only a year ago that many in the Venture Capital industry were predicting that “winter was coming” and to be fair the author of this post was chief amongst them. Yet as we enter February 2017 the VC funding markets are booming, Snap, Inc has filed for its IPO, AppDynamics was just purchased for $3.7 billion by Cisco and the only winter that can be found is at the ski resorts following California’s epic snowy and rainy January. Ok, Suster. So WTF happened? Why no winter? Actually, winter did come and I have the data that shows it. But the reality is that “global warming” massively blunted the effects of winter and my prognosis for VC fundings of entrepreneurs in 2017–2018 is now very sunny indeed. Unless of course something Trump’s our good weather. WINTER For starters when we conducted our annual VC & LP survey in December of 2016 to prepare our annual Upfront State of the VC Industry report we found that twice as many VCs cut their investments in 2016 relative to 2015 with > 30% of VCs having cut investments. And it’s not just that VCs cut their investment pace but they also indicated overwhelmingly that valuations of investments had dropped with 76% of all VCs surveyed suggesting 2016 had lower valuations than 2015. So VCs made fewer investments at lower prices and generally on terms that were more favorable to investors relative to 2015. This past year was also the year that startup boards also got more disciplined about containing burn rates and pushing for companies to be run more pragmatically. With nearly 2/3rd of all VCs citing cost-cutting in 2016 as the norm — this is a clear indication that winter made an appearance. So if funding from VCs slowed, valuations dropped and burn rates were slashed, WTF happened to winter again? “GLOBAL” Warming The first thing that’s clear is that global investors from China, Singapore, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Japan and elsewhere stepped in to fill the gap that was initially created by the VC pull back. On stark graph should give you a sense of the picture. Chinese Foreign Direct Investment (FDI, excluding real estate) skyrocketed in 2016 as Chinese investors seek diversification out of their domestic markets. While this it total FDI as opposed to just venture, it should give you an indication of the international trend. And while the US had FANG (Facebook, Amazon/Apple, Netflix and Google) China has BAT (Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent). Baidu alone raised $3.2 billion in venture capital funds with one A-round fund and one late-stage fund. In case you’re keeping score at home — that’s approximately the size of 65 US seed-stage funds managed by one company. Alibaba invested $800 million in just one deal — Magic Leap and Temasik (Singapore sovereign wealth fund) invested $800 million in Verily. Those two investments represent the equivalent of another 32 US seed-stage funds just in two deals. WeWork raised $690 million from Chinese investors, NextVR $80 million and Meta AR $50 million. In fact there are now so many Chinese VC funds chasing returns and also with the mandate the bring US innovation back to China that it would require an entire presentation just to talk about them all. But it’s not just China and Singapore. Saudi’s PIF + UAE’s Mubadala teamed up with Japan’s SoftBank to launch a new $100 billion fund. With oil prices dropping it’s clear that the region also had to diversity assets and also bring innovation back to their doorsteps. Perhaps this is why the Kuwait Investment Authority put $165 million into Jawbone and Saudi’s PIF put $3.5 billion into Uber. GLOBAL seems here to stay unless something stupid Trump’s it. Global “WARMING” But “global” isn’t the only story, warning is at least half of the equation. One big factor that is helping to push the VC markets is that frankly many other asset classes don’t have the return profiles asset managers desire given the perpetually low interest rates and 77% of LPs & VCs we surveyed felt this was a significant contributor to the booming VC markets. And while VCs had pulled back in 2016 it wasn’t only foreign investors who filled in the gap. One major group that has ramped up its venture investments have been corporates. Of course there’s the usual suspects like Google, Intel, Salesforce.com and Qualcomm but the total number of corporate VCs has more than doubled in the past 4 years from 61 major programs to 131. So you have GM investing $500 million in Lyft, BMW starting a $530 million venture fund, Comcast/NBCU investing $200 million into BuzzFeed and even Sesame Street now has a venture capital fund! And while twice as many VCs dialed back investments in 2016 over 2015 it was the exact opposite for Corporate VCs (CVCs) who filled in the gap for the market. And more than 50% of CVCs said they plan to invest even more in 2017. Corporations in the past 18 months have not only ramped up venture capital investments but they’ve also picked up the pace of mega-deals to buy startup companies and often from companies not always associated with big tech purchases like Unilever buying DollarShaveClub for $1 billion (go LA!) or Walmart buying Jet for $3 billion. We all know that M&A begets more venture investing. While the M&A story has been widely reported perhaps far fewer people know that Limited Partners (LPs), the people who fund VC firms, have finally been able to restock their coffers in the past 4 years with significantly more money coming to them in distributions than capital calls to fund VC firm investments. This chart surprised me the most. When LPs get distributions back they reinvest it into new asset programs in a diversified manner but when VC investments are yielding higher returns than other asset classes even this percentage is getting bigger so VCs are not only able to more easily raise funds but they’re also getting a large slice of the pie. Therefore it should come as no surprise that the number of funds and the amount of dollars raised have both doubled. And while this author would find it hard to ever say anything positive about the current president of the United States there is perhaps one decision that he seems likely to take that would likely benefit the US technology sector — a tax holiday on the repatriation of foreign capital. Many tech companies have earned huge profits overseas and since there is a tax on bringing it back into the US they leave it abroad. We estimate that the top 5 US tech firms have more than $500 billion in cash sitting abroad and if this is brought back to the US it is likely to increase: R&D expenditure, M&A deals and Venture Capital financings. So if I had to sum up for you what I see coming in the next two year’s of VC financings and why it will likely be a great time to be an entrepreneur in the US in 2017–2018 it’s this: But while funding for VCs and funding for tech startups should remain robust, funding is not the same thing as returns. And if the industry becomes over-funded I suspect it will lead to bad behavior at startups, bad behavior at VCs and thus overall depressed returns relative to smaller funding cycles. But this is normal business known as an “economic cycle.” If you want to read the full report it is here on SlideShare. We will also be publishing the full VC Survey and LP Survey over the course of the next couple of weeks.

He maintained his own personal social media accounts, had a summer job, and was getting ready to move to New Jersey for college. Victor Ricci. (Courtesy TrendPie)   That all changed the summer after his senior year of high school, when he posted a six second "life hack" video to his Vine account. The video of Ricci using a water bottle to separate the white and yolk of an egg, went viral. His Vine account, @QuickLifeHacks, which he described as videos that showed small tips to make everyday tasks easier, grew everyday, eventually reaching more than 1.4 million followers and becoming one of the most followed accounts in the world. "It definitely wasn't something I was trying to do," Ricci said of his sudden Internet fame. "I'm not even an avid social media user. Now, I don't even have the Facebook app on my phone." But, there was a monetary incentive to being a social media influencer. Ricci, now 22 and a senior at Seton Hall University, said he was contacted by companies offering him between $3,000 and $5,000 to feature their products in his short videos. Though the offers came at an inconsistent pace, Ricci said they helped support him during his first few years of college. More importantly, Ricci said, the offers gave him an idea. He transitioned away from social media stardom, and in April 2015 launched TrendPie, an Internet marketing company that connects brands to his network of non-celebrity online influencers. Instead of sporadic, high-cost campaigns, Ricci said his company offers regular, lower cost placements on the accounts of multiple organic social media influencers. The result is more successful for his clients, and a more regular revenue stream for the influencers, he said. "I think of it kind of as the Wal-Mart approach" Ricci said. "We charge less, but we do it everyday." $8M gift is one of largest ever to Seton Hall Almost two years later, as Ricci is finishing up his degree at Seton Hall, the plan seems to be working. He has four employees who all work remotely to keep the business running. TrendPie's influencers have a collective reach of 250 million followers. Its client roster has included apps like Drunk Mode and Sworkit, and companies like Yahoo and Aol. TrendPie said it has earned almost $1 million in sales since launching. Ricci runs TrendPie while pursuing a marketing degree, and running on Seton Hall's cross country team, which he has been a part of since his freshman year. "It's amazing to watch Vic do what he does," said Tony Testa, who heads Seton Hall's athletic training department. "He'll come in for a treatment or something, and stop in the middle to take a conference call. Then, he comes back ready to work." After graduation, Ricci said he hopes to open a TrendPie office, expand the company, and keep learning as he goes. "When I started, I didn't know how to run a company," he said. "Everyone has an idea, but most people don't act on them because they are too busy with other things. Sometimes you just need to take that first step."

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 February 2017 by Military News Farm Dog Technology Platform Saves Growers and Advisors 45 Minutes per Day, and is Now Publicly Available TEL AVIV, ISRAEL, February 6, 2017 (Newswire.com) – ​​​Farm Dog, a precision agriculture company, announces the public launch of its platform that enables Integrated Pest Management (IPM) adoption and 45 minutes per day savings for growers and their trusted advisors. Growers spend up to 20% of operating expenses on pest and disease management, yet still experience 20% to 40% annual crop loss due to pest and disease.  And even with increased scrutiny on pesticides and their use, the pesticide market is expected to grow to $80 billion per year by 2020, driving growers to search for more effective tools to counter threats to their crops. Every grower should have the opportunity to increase yields while reducing pesticide usage, no matter the acreage, which is why our world-class solution is also financially in-reach for all growers. Liron Brish, CEO Farm Dog provides growers and their advisors an easy and affordable way to implement best practices in IPM.  As a result of using Farm Dog, the company’s first users also identified savings of up to 45 minutes per day.   The in-field application and web dashboard drive data collection and communication, while data analytics provides insights such as treatment efficacy.  Farm Dog is currently in use on fields supplying crops to companies such as Costco, Walmart, McDonald’s, and Subway, and is one of a few companies to have integrated with John Deere.  Complementing the underlying precision agriculture technology, for its public launch the company placed extra emphasis on an easy onboarding process and affordable pricing model.  “From its founding, Farm Dog’s guiding mission has been that no farm should be left behind,” said Liron Brish, CEO and co-founder.  “Our registration process is instantaneous, giving our users the ability to start days, and sometimes weeks, before they would be able to on other platforms.” In addition, Farm Dog is available for free to a majority of growers.  “Every grower should have the opportunity to increase yields while reducing pesticide usage, no matter the acreage, which is why our world-class solution is also financially in-reach for all growers.  We look forward to building long-term relationships with all of our users,” added Brish. Media contact: Liron Brish (CEO) Mobile: +972.58.762.3077, +1.512.762.3077 Email: liron@farmdog.ag About Farm Dog: Farm Dog is a precision agriculture solution for pest and disease management to help growers reduce pesticide use while minimizing crop loss. Leading growers and agronomists worldwide rely on Farm Dog in their day-to-day operations.  The team includes experts from McKinsey & Co., army satellite imagery and intelligence units, and leading technlogy companies with an Advisory Board composed of the former Deputy Chief of Staff of the US Department of Agriculture, a 40 year veteran of pest management, and the former Chief Marketing Officer of Netafim.  For more information, please visit www.farmdog.ag.

About 6,000 people from Tonatico live in Waukegan. Acosta wants to work in the U.S. with his uncle, but fears it will be impossible. Brett Gundlock — Boreal Collective/The Washington Post The town of Tonatico, Mexico, on January 18. About 6,000 people from Tonatico live in Waukegan. Brett Gundlock — Boreal Collective/The Washington Post A local band performs in the streets of Tonatico, Mexico, during the town's annual fiesta. Tonatico is located about two hours from Mexico City. Brett Gundlock — Boreal Collective/The Washington Post A man lights of a rocket during the annual fiesta in Tonatico, Mexico, on January 18, 2017. Brett Gundlock — Boreal Collective/The Washington Post   By Joshua Partlow and Kari Lydersen The Washington Post TONATICO, Mexico -- At this time of year, Mexican traditions are on colorful display in this little town lined with cobblestone streets. Every night for weeks, candlelit processions honoring the local patron saint set the colonial plaza aglow. Fireworks erupt over the church bell tower as mariachis serenade the faithful. It is the American-ness of Tonatico that reveals itself more gradually. You see it in the man crossing the plaza wearing a Chicago Blackhawks jersey. You hear it in the voice of the deported student still struggling with Spanish. The tablets the waiters use to take orders at Restaurante Rebeca were purchased at a Best Buy in Illinois; the refrigerated loading bays at the guava exporting factory comply with U.S. biohazard regulations. One of the elementary schools that was named after the Mexican revolutionary hero Emiliano Zapata recently became Escuela Primaria Henry Ford. For decades, the defining aspiration in this town tucked in the hills two hours southwest of Mexico City has been to leave for the United States, particularly for Waukegan. About 6,000 people from Tonatico live in Waukegan, about half as many people as remain in their hometown. President Donald Trump has pledged to build a border wall, deport millions of illegal immigrants and change the terms of trade with Mexico. The deeper relations between Mexico and the United States are the bonds of lives, the invisible exchange of culture between 30 million people of Mexican descent in America and their hometowns. The growing fear among Mexicans in Waukegan about Trump's policies is felt just as keenly 2,100 miles away. "When Donald Trump won, I was, like, is this serious?" said Saray Rea, a 20-year-old student whose family moved back to Tonatico from Waukegan last year. Her father got laid off when a new owner at his company did not want to employ "illegals," she said, and her mother could not pay for the mouth surgery she needed without medical insurance. These days, her friends in Illinois post ugly things about immigrants on Facebook. "The U.S. is my home country. I thought people were different," she said. "And when he won, it really broke my heart." Waukegan has a defunct marine motor industry, contaminated Superfund sites and a polluting coal plant on the shores of Lake Michigan. Mexican immigrants have been moving there for decades and they consider themselves a revitalizing force, people who open small businesses and work hard. Many of their relatives in Mexico live off the money they send home. Tonaticans run a quinceañera dress shop, a hardware store, a bakery, an auto shop, a travel agency and at least six restaurants with names such as Antojitos Tonatico, El Sol de Tonatico, and Ostioneria Briza Azul. While the Mexicans are aware of the anger some Americans have about lost jobs to immigrants, they say they contribute positively to the local economy. Two of the Acosta brothers run the Briza Azul: Mauricio is the chef; his younger brother Leo is the owner. Growing up in Tonatico, Leo used to notice the Mexicans back from Waukegan, with their nice tennis shoes, bicycles and cars. "As young people we'd look at them, and like everybody, I decided to come," he said. The business opened 11 years ago: seafood with a taste of Tonatico. Murals of octopus and lobster decorate the walls next to scenes of Tonatico and its famous thermal springs. They serve langostina "a la Doña Ana," after their mother's recipe, in a chile de arbol and peanut sauce. Their dishwasher, their waiters, their customers are all from Tonatico. All but one of the nine Acosta siblings live in the United States. The brothers now worry that Trump's threat of tariffs will make their ingredients -- avocados from Michoacán, shrimp from Yucatán, chilies from central Mexico -- more expensive. A crackdown on undocumented labor could reduce their workforce. A new sense of menace has invaded Mexican lives in Waukegan. At Leo's daughter's high school, "Whites Only" was recently scrawled on a bathroom stall door. Marychel Figueroa, a 19-year-old sophomore at Marquette University who was in Tonatico for Christmas break visiting her grandparents, mentioned that some students avoid sitting next to her because her family is Mexican, even though she was born and raised in the United States. During a documentary about immigrants in one of her criminology classes, a student turned around and told her: "This is why we need more walls," she recalled. At Target near campus, where Figueroa works, she has noticed that Latinos are buying fewer expensive items -- furniture, beds -- out of fear of the future. "People are actually starting to take the initiative of selling their things and moving out and going back to their homeland," she said. On inauguration morning, Marco Salcedo, the 47-year-old owner of Marco Salon in Waukegan, changed his Facebook profile to a black background. "My country is in mourning today," he wrote. Because of Trump's victory, Salcedo has considered moving back to Mexico, a country he barely knows anymore. He left Tonatico at age 16 to join his aunt, and became a U.S. citizen. "I'm not sure about the future now," he said. "People are afraid." "Did you bring your glasses?" Ricardo Acosta asked his small team gathered on the road next to the cornfield in Tonatico. "Your gloves?" His son -- a slender, shy young man also named Ricardo -- wrapped a red handkerchief around his face and pulled a blue cap down to his protective goggles. He started helping in the fields when he was 12. Now, at 19, he works six days a week for $9 a day. The job this morning was to feed dried corn stalks into a thresher and then bag the mulch, which would be used as fertilizer for tomatoes. The men trudged out to the acre-sized plot. They fired up the tractor and slid armfuls of stalks into the whining chipper. Within minutes, corn dust coated the younger Ricardo's goggles and every exposed part of his face. He coughed as he filled the sacks. The available work around Tonatico tends to be of this variety -- manual labor in the fields. Most of the crops produced here -- tomatoes, corn, cucumbers, onions, peppers, limes and guava -- are consumed domestically, but some companies are expanding into exports. One of them is a company called Frutos con Sabor a México ("Fruit with the Flavor of Mexico"). Its cinder-block warehouse -- with its high-tech produce-sorting machinery from the Netherlands, refrigerated loading bays and wire ventilation screens to keep out vermin -- has been designed with the U.S. market in mind. The company sells to Walmart and other supermarkets, said Cesar Samudio, a company manager. "Difficult times might be coming," Samudio said, referring to a possible trade war with the United States. For many youth of this town, the allure of the United States is as strong as ever. In December, 19-year-old Ricardo Acosta mailed his uncle, Alfredo Acosta, an application to work with him at a landscaping company in Waukegan. (The family is not related to the restaurateurs.) The company, which employs about 300 people, the majority Mexican, arranges for temporary work visas for some of its staff. Ricardo has not received an answer. Trump pledged to "buy American and hire American" during his inaugural address. His administration has warned that it would revise the temporary worker programs. "They say that Trump is not going to give any more visas. And the company where I work is nervous," said Alfredo Acosta, who has lived in the United States for 18 years and obtained his legal residency last year. One evening, Ricardo rode his motorcycle up the winding road to the hill with the towering cross that overlooks Tonatico. He liked to come alone at dusk and watch the darkness settle and the lights twinkle on across the town. He opened a can of beer and thought about his future in silence. Ricardo's father once lived in Waukegan, working in landscaping. After less than a year, he returned to Tonatico, following a woman. The father knew the fields were fickle. The pay was meager. But to him, the vertigo of undocumented life felt too unsettling. "As an illegal, it's very difficult. You are always thinking the migra will catch you," he said.

And in the aftermath of his Muslim travel ban, the hits keep on coming. The latest developments show just how deeply the Trump administration has wounded the national psyche. Last week two icons of American corporate culture, Disney and Amazon, took important steps to define themselves in opposition to President Trump’s transparently bigoted executive order. Many other American companies have taken up the role of change agents to oppose the Muslim ban and other Trump policies. But the Disney-Amazon duo is a particularly significant one-two punch in terms of corporate social responsibility because the two companies took two very different paths to arrive at the same place. Mickey Mouse pokes President Trump In what is becoming a predictable pattern, Trump set himself up for last week’s Disney debacle by insisting on scheduling highly-publicized, much-anticipated meetings with the top executives of leading U.S. companies. One such meeting happened last Friday, consisting of leading companies that signed onto Trump’s newly formed Strategy and Policy Forum group. Publicity surrounding the event made the absence of Disney CEO Bob Iger all the more conspicuous. Disney said Iger was absent due to a previously scheduled board meeting, and so far Iger has not officially pulled out of the group. Nevertheless, the decision to go to one meeting instead of the other has created the appearance of a deliberate A-list snub. After all, who skips a sit-down with the president of the United States for a routine board meeting? Regardless of the explanation, some industry observers are hailing the decision as step in the right direction for Disney. Corporate social responsibility collides with the Muslim ban The animation industry news organization Cartoon Brew was among the first to break the story of Iger’s absence. Cartoon Brew editor Amid Amidi had been sharply critical of Disney’s participation in the group, and he applauded the decision with this observation: “… There’s a key difference between Disney and the other corporations participating in Trump’s forum, and that’s that Disney is a cultural brand. It stands not just for products, but ideas, and over the last decade, the company has made a concerted effort to show that its ideas are socially progressive.” Amidi hammered home the point: “This forward-looking stance by Disney cannot be reconciled with an American president whose every word and action goes against the company’s core values.” The Muslim ban issue is a particularly fraught one for the Disney brand because visionary founder Walt Disney was plagued by rumors of anti-Semitism during his lifetime. Disney biographer Neal Gabler make the case that the available records don’t indicate Disney expressed bigotry as part of his personality. However, Gabler says the evidence is clear (cited here in the Independent) that “he willingly allied himself with people who were antisemitic, and that reputation stuck.” The enduring impact of affiliating with bigotry probably sent up red flags among company employees and observers even before Trump issued his executive order restricting travel from seven Muslim-majority countries. The so-called Muslim ban certainly opened the floodgates, with Variety reporting that Disney’s membership in the Strategy and Policy Forum was “kicking up a storm” of protest last week. In this context it’s also worth noting that Trump group member and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick initially mishandled his company’s response to the Muslim ban. The backlash from both employees and customers was swift and strong, but as of last Wednesday Kalanick was still planning to attend Friday’s meeting. However, following a reportedly “disastrous” phone call with Trump on Thursday, Kalanick declined to attend the Friday meeting and dropped out of the group altogether. Trump added to fuel to the fire last Saturday by sharply disparaging the federal judge who ruled against the Muslim ban on Friday night. The “so-called” jurist (Trump’s words) happens to be a Republican appointee who is widely regarded as a mainstream conservative. Last weekend Trump also touched off an entirely new firestorm. In a taped Fox News interview released on Saturday, Trump equated Russian President Vladimir Putin’s reputation for ordering political assassinations with practices of the U.S. government. Between the Muslim ban, the jab at a Republican-appointed judge and the explosive swipe at the Republican Party’s “American exceptionalism” attack line, more defections from the Strategy and Policy group are likely. According to the Trump transition website GreatAgain.gov, the remaining corporate members include General Motors, Walmart, Boeing, the Elon Musk companies SpaceX and Tesla, PepsiCo, IBM, and General Electric, among others. Amazon: A “stealth” hero vs. the Muslim ban Like Disney, Amazon has been feeling the heat over its continued affiliation with the Trump brand. However, it looks like Amazon can take at least partial credit for Friday night’s bombshell ruling, which effectively restored travel back to pre-ban regulations. Early last week, the company joined with Expedia in support of a lawsuit against the Muslim ban filed by the state of Washington. The federal judge hearing that case decided against the Trump administration and granted a temporary restraining order that applies nationwide. (That’s what prompted the now notorious “so-called judge” tweet from Trump on Saturday.) The Justice Department appealed the ruling over the weekend, but the appeal was tossed out and the Friday decision stands. The participation of Expedia and Amazon was critical to the favorable ruling, because lawyers for the Trump administration rested their case partly on whether or not the state of Washington had standing to sue. In support of the state’s case, Amazon identified at least 49 individual employees affected by Trump’s executive order. Cited in Forbes, Amazon filed a statement that included this declaration: “From the very beginning, Amazon has been committed to equal rights, tolerance, and diversity — and we always will be. As we’ve grown the company, we’ve worked hard to attract talented people from all over the world, and we believe this is one of the things that makes America great — a diverse workforce helps us build better products for customers.” The common thread in all this is something that TriplePundit contributor Reed Bundy described as the “birth of a new era of corporate social responsibility,” in which business leaders become change agents who challenge government to act in the best interests of all citizens. Bob Iger and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos are taking steps in that direction, along with hundreds of others. It could be only a matter of time before other high-profile corporate luminaries, such as Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla’s Elon Musk, get off the couch. So far Zuckerberg has issued a somewhat lukewarm response to the Muslim ban. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg has yet to comment, though last week during a public appearance she dropped some hints that indicate she will take a stronger position in the future. As of last week, Musk promised to “raise objections” to the Muslim ban in advance of Friday’s meeting. That may not be enough to satisfy Tesla fans, who are beginning to cancel their orders for Tesla cars to express dissatisfaction with Musk’s tepid response. Don’t hold your breath for Silicon Valley superstar investor Peter Thiel to act. Last week Thiel asserted, through a spokesperson, that the Muslim ban was not a religious test. Thiel is unlikely to back down from that position, considering his affiliations. Following the 2016 presidential campaign, the billionaire tech investor and Facebook board member has transitioned from prominent Trump for President supporter to key President Trump advisor.

By Erik Loomis February 6, 2017 Days after the inauguration, the leaders of several building trade unions met with President Donald Trump at the White House, outraging those on the left who want organized labor to lead the resistance to the president’s anti-worker policies. The building trades cited Trump’s call for infrastructure investment and their warm personal relationship with him as reasons to be optimistic about his presidency. As reported in The New York Times, Sean McGarvey, president of North America’s Building Trade Unions, stated, “We have a common bond with the president. We come from the same industry. He understands the value of driving development, moving people to the middle class.” Laborers International Union of North America (LIUNA) President Terry O’Sullivan talked of Trump’s “commitment to creating hundreds of thousands of working-class jobs.” The next day, Trump announced that he would reverse former President Barack Obama’s decision to reject the Keystone XL Pipeline and that he would restart construction on the Dakota Access Pipeline. He also said he would go through with his campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. The building trades were enthusiastic. O’Sullivan wrote victoriously, “President Trump has shown that it is not difficult to put country above politics and create an energy-independent America. He has shown that he respects laborers who build our great nation, and that they will be abandoned no more.” In the same breath, he lambasted Obama for caving to “environmental extremists.” The building trades’ support of anything that creates a job, no matter the cost to the nation or the environment, has given the union movement a bad name in progressive circles. The pipeline battles have galvanized the left to fight for indigenous rights and against climate change. From the outset, O’Sullivan has been contemptuous of the rest of the progressive movement. Moreover, he has bullied other unions to stay out of the question of pipeline construction—seemingly forgetting that all of us have to live in a world plagued by dirty energy. And if the building trades keep this up, they will damage themselves by alienating the allies they need to survive the Trump era. This kind of behavior is hardly new. The building trades have long aligned themselves with racist and exclusionary forces. The labor movement’s first major legislative victory in the United States was the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which originated with California workers angry about Chinese competition. The trades consistently supported immigration restriction well after the Immigration Act of 1965 reopened America’s borders to the world’s tired and poor. The Congress of Industrial Organizations, founded in 1935 by United Mine Workers of America President John L. Lewis to organize the millions of workers in the nation’s industrial sectors, was necessary because the trades not only refused to allow women, Asian-Americans, African-Americans, and unskilled workers into their unions, but also opposed any effort by other unions to organize them. The building trades have long aligned themselves with racist and exclusionary forces. In 1970, the New York building trades organized to beat up antiwar protesters. Richard Nixon rewarded Peter Brennan, who headed the New York building trades, by naming him secretary of the Labor Department. Combined with the AFL-CIO’s refusal to endorse George McGovern in 1972, a decision supported by many of the building trades, this ruined the reputation of organized labor among the left for a generation. The broader labor movement, of course, has a much nobler history. The pillars of American social democracy were built by Democratic administrations and labor, particularly the industrial unions that were formed from the millions of workers who had joined the movement by the end of World War II. United Auto Workers President Walter Reuther, for example, believed unions would be central players in all post-war economic planning and had staffers working full-time on issues such as nuclear safety. Reuther also was organized labor’s most prominent supporter of the civil rights movement: The UAW paid for much of the March on Washington, even as the AFL-CIO, led by its Cold War–obsessed President George Meany, refused to endorse it. The difference between the industrial and trade unions on social policy was made clear soon after the CIO organized the industrial workforce. In the Pacific Northwest, for instance, my own research demonstrates how in the late 1930s and 1940s, the CIO-affiliated International Woodworkers of America demanded government regulation of private timber harvests, the end of the ecologically destructive practice of clearcutting, and strict management of the forests to preserve them for future generations, an agenda similar to what environmentalists would demand several decades later. Their building trade rival in the Northwest, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, today one of the unions that met with Trump, responded by redbaiting the IWA and calling for employers to make all decisions on managing the forest. Industrial unions played a central role in creating the postwar liberal order. They promoted a vision of a broad middle class, lobbied Congress for the money to make the underlying programs work, and provided union votes to politicians who had their back. The building trades played little role in developing these democratic forces, even as their members benefited. Corporations regained their hold over the nation’s politics by decimating the industrial unions. They closed factories, busted unions, and moved jobs overseas. The United Auto Workers is a shell of its former self. The United Steelworkers has tried organizing in different fields, but its numbers have also fallen precipitously. The United Food and Commercial Workers, the descendant of the CIO-affiliated United Packinghouse Workers, has decent clout with some grocery chains, but has been unable to penetrate Walmart and the other retailers that have transformed the food industry. Most of the old industrial unions—the United Rubber Workers, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, and so many others—are gone, along with the jobs. The broad-based social policies these unions fought for are now in the process of being repealed by an emboldened Republican Party. Public sector unions such as SEIU and AFSCME have filled some of that political vacuum, fighting for health care, higher minimum wages, and other economic justice programs. But the public sector unions are incredibly diverse, ranging from professors to home health care workers. They lack the common working class culture that would be needed to replicate the mass movements of the New Deal era. As a result, the building trades once again hold an outsized amount of power within the labor movement. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka is the most politically progressive labor federation leader in American history, with the possible exception of Reuther, but he is beholden to his constituent unions when shaping policy. He cannot take a strong stand in support of protesters stopping the Dakota Access Pipeline without alienating powerful people like McGarvey and O’Sullivan. The trade unions seem incapable of realizing that the Trump administration is not their friend. In Rhode Island, where I live, there is currently a major political battle over the siting of a power plant that is to use fracked natural gas and diesel oil. The state’s environmental community has come out in force against this project, urging the state to adopt a clean energy future. LIUNA has not only vigorously supported the project, but its members have also stood outside meetings and openly jeered environmentalists. After the meeting with Trump, labor journalist Cole Stangler recalled a previous conversation in which he asked McGarvey if he was concerned about the environmental impact of fracking. McGarvey said no, and Stangler could hear laughter in the background at the question. But the trade unions seem incapable of realizing that the Trump administration is not their friend. In the meeting with Trump, they asked him to pledge not to repeal the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act. This law requires the federal government to pay contractors a “locally prevailing wage,” as determined by the Department of Labor. It serves to ensure that those workers building American infrastructure are paid a fair wage. Republicans dislike it and Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona has introduced a bill to overturn the law. Trump will almost certainly sign this bill. Trump has routinely refused to pay the contractors he has hired, and has never supported unions except when they can help him. Sadly, the building trades believe that supporting Trump’s projects will pay off for them. The repeal of Davis-Bacon will be sad. It will hurt workers and hurt unions. On the other hand, what have the building trades ever done for any other progressive group? With some exceptions, the trades have failed to understand the value of solidarity. In doing so, they are facing a situation in which they will have few allies in the fight to keep Davis-Bacon in place. Their short-sightedness is even greater considering the Muslim ban the Trump administration imposed last week. Any organization not fighting for our most vulnerable residents will not receive support from the left for its own goals. The building trades have a singular obsession with jobs at any cost. That is understandable given the lack of union work in this country. But it also ignores the other concerns of their members—the civil rights of their black and Latino members, the need of their female members to have access to birth control and health care, and the universal need for a livable planet. Environmentalists have failed to reach out to the building trades by not demanding that our green energy infrastructure be union-made. But if LIUNA members are going to taunt environmentalists, and if building trade leaders are going to support Trump’s decision to run roughshod over indigenous rights by building the Dakota Access Pipeline, they bring the hostility of the left down on themselves. Only a progressive labor movement that sees workers as part of a larger social movement for justice and equality can represent the interests of all working-class Americans, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or immigration status. The building trades have too often been the enemy of these goals. And by supporting Trump’s actions, they have done so again.

Meanwhile, what we, the People, are doing to resist injustice, oppression, discrimination, hate, bigotry, and authoritarianism is downright inspiring. Nonviolent action is reaching new heights of creativity in the United States, widening in frequency and participation. Here’s just a sample of how ordinary, extraordinary people have mobilized for justice in the past month. 4.5 Million People (3.3 Million In US) March for Women’s Rights on Inauguration Weekend The Women’s March and Sister Marches exploded across the US and around the world the day after the inauguration. March turnouts doubled or tripled expectations, and the number of solidarity or related marches far exceeded expectations. From senior citizens marching with walkers around nursing homes to 30 freezing souls in Antarctica to hundreds of thousands in the major US cities to ex-patriots overseas, people marched in support of women and against the demeaning rhetoric and discriminatory proposed policies of Pres. Donald Trump. In addition to organizers, civil resistance researchers Jeremy Pressman and Erica Chenoweth worked with a network of people to catalogue the sheer massiveness of these actions. Greenpeace Welcomes Trump to White House with RESIST Banner Drop Welcome to the White House, Mr. President. Soon after the inauguration, Greenpeace activists dropped a photo-bomb of a banner drop off a giant crane parked behind the White House. The one-word banner said it all: RESIST. Federal Workers Noncooperation and Resistance to Trump Administration Bureaucratic obstruction may be par for the course in Washington DC during a change of presidential administrations, but levels of noncooperation and resistance to the Trump Administration from federal workers are reaching new heights of political significance . . . and creativity. From collective resignations, letters of opposition, refusal to cooperate with assignments and orders, the federal workers (the ones who don’t change with every election) are taking subtle, but powerful action on behalf of civil and human rights, and protection of public programs. And, 180 federal employees signed up for a workshop where experts will offer advice on workers’ rights and how they can express civil disobedience. @AltNatParkSer Turns Park Rangers Into Unexpected Climate Heroes Speaking of federal workers, our favorite story of resistance comes from the unlikely heroes of the National Park Service. Yes, the park rangers. When a climate change gag order was sent out, the employee who ran the Badlands National Park Twitter account went rogue, disobeyed, and tweeted truth to power about climate change and the threat it poses. When the employee was shut out of the account and the tweets deleted, alternative Twitter handles popped up. @AltNatParkSer tweeted: You can take our official twitter, but you’ll never take our free time! In 36 hours, they had over one million followers and 50 other @AtlGov accounts had been opened. Sanctuary Cities Pick Up Steam, Defy Threats The Sanctuary City movement is spreading like wildfire, rallying local, county, and state opposition to immigration and deportation plans. Mayors, City Councils, Police Departments are all pledging to refuse to assist ICE in deporting immigrants. The Trump Administration has threatened to cut off federal funding to Sanctuary Cities, but many of them remain determined and resolute. The Mayor of Boston even offered his office and City Hall as a sanctuary. According to some reports, the State of California (the ninth largest economy in the world) has threatened to cut off funding to the federal government if the Trump Administration cuts off federal funding to the state over their many sanctuary cities. Oh, and About That Wall . . . Trump’s infamous Mexico Border Wall has set off a flurry of choice words from both the former and current Presidents of Mexico who are outraged about the arrogance of the wall proposal and the threat to make Mexico pay for it. For this and other reasons, Mexican citizens have organized boycotts against prominent US companies – Walmart, Starbucks, Coca-Cola, and others – rallying support under #AdiosProductosAmericanos. Meanwhile, the tribal nation of Tohono O’oodham vows that it will never build a wall across the 75 miles of its land that spans the US-Mexican border. By the way, if this border wall is built, it will end up costing every US household $120. Muslim Ban Catalyzes Massive Airport Demonstrations, 1000s of NYC Bodega Protest Strikes, Taxi Driver Strikes and #DeleteUber When President Trump closed entry to the US to seven Muslim-majority nations, he unleashed a storm of opposition from US citizens. When immigrants were detained at airports, massive airport demonstrations flooded airports nationwide. The airport taxi drivers went on strike . . . and when rumor went out that Uber would continue to provide airport service, citizens launched #DeleteUber and to encourage users to delete the Uber App from their phones. The ACLU waded into the fray and won some important victories for immigrant rights. Then thousands of bodegas closed early in New York City in protest over the Muslim Ban. Hundreds of DC officials have made public declarations of opposition to the ban. Overseas, Iraq and Iran took steps to ban US citizens from entering their countries. 818 Companies Drop Advertisement on Breitbart Did you hear about how Rush Limbaugh was edged off the air by a quiet, persistent nonviolent campaign to get advertisers to withdraw from stations that carried his show? Well, that nonviolent strategy strikes again . . . this time at the right-wing journal Breitbart. Eight hundred and eighteen companies have dropped their advertising with the site – which has as much news creditability as the Onion, according to a recent poll. The campaigners have succeeded in getting major companies to pull out, including key companies overseas as Breitbart plans an international expansion. Merriam-Webster Dictionary Objects to #AlternativeFacts You know you’re in trouble when even the dictionary takes umbrage. After Kellyanne Conway referred to falsehoods as “alternative facts”, Merriam-Webster Dictionary retorted on social media, “A fact is a fact, and calling falsehoods “alternative facts” doesn’t make something a fact.” Thanks, dictionary people! Now that that’s clarified . . . let’s talk about science and facts. Scientist March on Washington, #ScienceNotSilence Scientists and science-supporters are marching on Washington DC after a series of Trump Administration actions pushed them into a phase transition state. No longer confined to laboratories, they’re taking action on Earth Day with a March for Science in DC and everywhere. With the slogan #ScienceNotSilence, they’re protesting the threatened erasure of climate science databases at NASA, the attempt to take down the climate data pages on the EPA website, the muzzling of officials on the subject of climate change (such as the Park Rangers), and the general dismissal of scientific fact by politicians and power holders. Some scientists have even formed a group to run for public offices: 314 Action . . . named for the first three numbers in pi. That’s just some of the incredible nonviolent actions that have happened recently. Take heart. Resistance in 2017 is off to a powerful and provocative start . . . and the movements are growing daily.   Join the debate on Facebook Rivera Sun is the author of The Dandelion Insurrection and other books, and the cofounder of the Love-In-Action Network.

  You are here: Home > Business > Retail and Services Global online purchasing fever By Luo Lan 0 Comment(s)Print E-mail China Today, February 6, 2017 Adjust font size: The Black Friday sales promotion offers consumers a dazzling array of goods.  Consumers worldwide have embraced the latest cyber-purchasing passion – overseas online shopping. From daily necessities like meals, toothpaste, and slippers, to furniture, electrical appliances, garments, and luxury items, cyber shoppers now have a global scale of choice. China has been foremost in the furor of this latest shopping mode, not only as its most popular source, but also for its abundance of avid overseas online shoppers. Shopping on Chinese Websites Internet retailer Alibaba cleaned up once more during last year's November 11 online shopping bonanza, nicknamed the Double 11 Festival, partly thanks to its overseas patrons. The commodities available on Chinese websites indeed attract many shoppers from abroad. Since British multinational grocer and general merchandise retailer Tesco introduced the Laoganma brand of chili sauce, highly recommended by the New York Times, it has been a favorite both with Chinese overseas students and their local peers. American housewife Debbie reportedly spends one third of her spare time surfing Chinese websites for bargains and smart outfits that are much admired by her neighbors. In Russia, around 15 million citizens surf Chinese shopping websites. A survey of online consumption trends showed that China's Taobao is the most popular shopping website among netizens in Japan – keen purchasers of the Chinese Dabao cosmetic brand, whose products sell online for just one tenth of the price at Japanese retailers – the U.S., Russia, and the EU. In addition to their high product quality, the popularity of Chinese products is attributable also to network advances. Results of a survey among foreign consumers showed that, in 2012 only three percent of respondents could name even one Chinese brand, but by 2015 this figure had risen to 23 percent. Shopping on Chinese websites is now commonplace abroad. The PayPal and Ipsos Third Annual Global Report showed that China is the most popular overseas online shopping country. The report examined the consumption habits of more than 280 million online shoppers in 32 countries worldwide. It found that around 21 percent buy from Chinese websites, 17 percent from those in the U.S., and 13 percent from U.K. websites. Shoppers surveyed sought high quality, low-priced goods. Around 76 percent patronized overseas online shopping due to favorable prices, and 65 percent because they could thus obtain goods unavailable in their home countries. Another 46 percent appreciated the free deliveries, and 44 percent the more secure payment mode. Many shoppers make purchases on smartphones, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. The report showed that about 37 percent of overseas shopping in the region is carried out on mobile devices, especially smart phones, and that around 68 percent of consumers there have shopped by phone over the past 12 months. Mobile shopping in China has also significantly increased in recent years. In 2016 spending via smart phones accounted for 35 percent of the total volume of overseas online shopping. The figure in 2015 was 27 percent. Expanding Yearly As overseas consumers focus on Chinese websites, Chinese customers also use the Internet to browse commodities on the overseas market. Chinese people's daily-use articles often include products from around the world, such as Japanese pharmaceuticals, Australian healthcare products, Korean cosmetics, French fashion garments, and Sri Lankan tea, most of which are bought online. Recent online shopping festivals generated huge profits for many e-commerce platforms. During the first 10 minutes of November 11, 2016, the amount of rice ordered from www.JD.com increased 100-fold, and JD's global purchase orders registered a year-on-year growth of 170 percent. About 13,000 international brands were included in the Tmall online shopping festival, when it took just 9.5 hours for Tmall to surpass its 2015 Double 11 Festival sales volume. The amount of www.tepin.hk orders was also 5.5-fold that of 2015. Black Friday, another manic shopping festival, is when overseas e-commerce platforms such as Amazon.com and ymatou.com recommend thousands of products to consumers. JD.com's global purchasing has also launched services, such as panic and low price buying. Amazon China, meanwhile, offers Prime membership, while Alipay supports global payments covering more than 200 countries and regions. Owing to their ever broadening range of consumer tastes and purchase demands, Chinese consumers have become the main force behind overseas online shopping. The PayPal and Ipsos Second Annual Global Report underlines 2015 as a significant year in this respect, as it was then that around 35 percent of Chinese consumers opted for overseas online shopping, compared to 26 percent in 2014. The scope of Chinese overseas online shopping expands yearly, covering more than two million types of commodities from 100 countries and regions. The report showed that in 2015, around 22 percent of Chinese online buyers purchased from American websites, as compared with 14 percent in 2014. Purchases by Chinese consumers also showed 10 percent growth in Japan and South Korea, due to their high quality goods at favorable prices, and access to products not available in China. Insiders report that the frequency in 2016 of Chinese overseas online shopping was 18 times per buyer, as compared to the seven times of 2015. The average amount expended was over RMB 10,000 – the highest more than RMB 900,000. According to China E-business Research Center projections, the number of Chinese overseas online shoppers will hit 35.6 million in 2018, equal to a more than RMB one trillion market. Online and Offline Service Along with development of e-business, an Omni-channel sales model integrating online and offline service is now available – an innovation insiders believe will prove an irresistible trend. For the next two decades, e-business will undoubtedly combine with offline service and logistics. Many merchants are already taking the first steps in this direction. In contrast with earlier years, in 2016 Alibaba focused on both online and offline services, linking more than one million online stores and offering digitization to more than 100,000 physical stores. JD.com also cooperated with Walmart in the lead-up to last year's online shopping festival. During Black Friday in 2016, the Friendship&Apollo Group launched its Omni-channel mode offering online shoppers products from 50 countries and regions. The group has opened a dozen overseas shopping experience centers for local consumers. According to advisory body IDC, during the 2016 Double 11 Festival, the main achievement of Omni-channel distribution became clear; further meshing supply chains, logistics and users appreciably eases antagonism between store retail and e-business. This integration is happening nationwide. Hangzhou's Cross-border Trading Town includes national and themed pavilions from Oceania, Europe, Asia, and America. They offer thousands of popular items, from cosmetics, healthcare products, and food items to mother and baby products, household appliances, and garments. Consumers can try them out there and then, and buy these taxable commodities either directly from the store or online. Products are delivered from bonded warehouse, so covering the entire process from offline experience to online shopping. Experts believe that online-offline integration is the future of commercial development. It can also promote city and countryside integration by giving full play to each one's respective advantages, achieve better service, lower cost, higher efficiency, and so better satisfy consumer demands and gradually equalize the uneven development of China's e-commerce. In 2016, the government also introduced e-commerce to rural areas, communities and small to medium-sized cities in efforts to hasten integration of online and offline development.

Students Sam Parmentier, left, and Hunter Nalepka face each other in St. Joan of Arc Catholic School's annual academic challenge. St. Joan of Arc School  The author, who now resides in Columbus, published his memoir, Cuyahoga's Child: Growing Up in the Valley of the Crooked River, in 2015. In the 334 page book Knowles writes about the foundry that was located behind the city center along railroad tracks west of the state Route 91 bridge. Along with "dodging molten metal splashes," the young Knowles learned about the mill workers while playing on an industrial softball league. He said he did not appreciate the full context of the culture and landscape of northeastern Ohio until his middle age. In his book he describes his boyhood home that overlooked "the magnificent river valley" and the overgrown ruins of a lock on the Ohio-Erie Canal which contributed to the region's economic growth and where waters flowed that once marked the western boundary of the US. The book's foreword was written by Stephen Paschen, Kent State University professor emeritus, and several photos were provided by Ohio nature and landscape photographer, Ian Adams. The book is available at Loganberry's in Shaker Heights and Mac's Backs Books in Cleveland Heights. St. Joan Academic Challenge: Students at St. Joan of Arc Catholic School in Chagrin Falls squared off recently in an academic competition during Catholic Schools Week. Two teams were formed, a blue team and a gold team, with four students from each grade in kindergarten through eighth grade. The remaining student body cheered them on as contestants answered questions from all subjects, ranging from geography to religion and science.  In the end, the blue team prevailed with the most points. Earlier in the day, eighth-grader Sophia Gildone took top prize in the school's annual spelling bee. Runner-up was seventh-grader, Lilly Price. The students also took part in a community service day and student appreciation day. Catholic Schools Week is celebrated during the last week in January. No Bad Luck Here: Although opening an umbrella indoors has been thought to bring bad luck, the Lake/Geauga Education Assistance Foundation will display some 70 student-painted umbrellas starting Feb. 8 from the skylights of the Great Lakes Mall in Mentor. For the project, 130 students from eight high schools teamed up to design and paint their own interpretation of the theme "Our Community" onto plain, white umbrellas using waterproof markers. The student-designed umbrellas will be judged by volunteer community artists and each umbrella team will participate in a crowd-funding event. The first place team will win a $1,500 college scholarship, and the second place team will win a $1,000 college scholarship.  High school engineering students at the Lake Shore Compact, a technical education consortium of Euclid, Wickliffe and Mentor High schools designed and engineered the umbrella display holders. One engineering team will receive a $1,000 college scholarship from LEAF. The project will culminate with a live umbrella auction and "Singing in the Rain" fashion show 5:30 p.m. May 4 at the mall. The top five student teams, along with 20 local community artists, will walk the runway with their umbrellas.

Chardon Workers Give to Community: Employees from the Fairmount Santrol plant in Chardon worked with United Way Services of Geauga County and Walmart to assemble 1,200 care packages for local middle school and high school students in need. With the boss's permission, they shut down the plant and loaded their trucks with items not covered in SNAP programs, such as shampoo, deodorant and feminine products donated by Walmart and toothbrushes and toothpaste donated by Chardon Smile Center and Delta Dental. "After discussing the needs of local students with Joan Blackburn of Chardon Schools, we decided this project was the right one for our team," said Josh Holbrook of Fairmount Santrol. One in five Geauga County students receives free or reduced lunches, which means those families are struggling economically, according to UWS. The packages were delivered to Chardon and Newbury schools as well as Berkshire High School in Burton. In the past, Fairmount employees planted trees with the Geauga Park District, helped paint and refresh the Dog Warden's building, worked on projects at Santa's Hide-A-Way Hollow, and assisted the Department on Aging with spring/fall yard cleanups.     Good News Hunting: Post your events and stories here.

Text size share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint Jill Gaulding was a freshly transplanted Iowa law professor 10 years ago when she googled who in the Twin Cities might share her interest in tackling bias and litigating gender inequality. The search connected her with an attorney and law professor named Lisa Stratton, and together they created a St. Paul nonprofit law firm that has emerged as the force behind some of the most influential federal civil rights lawsuits Minnesota has seen in recent years. Working out of a cramped office a few blocks from the State Capitol, Gender Justice helped win a judgment against a Saudi prince who refused to use female limousine drivers in Rochester; lobbied successfully to strengthen Minnesota's nursing mothers' law, and helped bring the first federal case to test a nondiscrimination clause in the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Today the lawyers at Gender Justice find themselves contemplating a very different legal landscape, one in which the ACA might be repealed and the U.S. Supreme Court could gain a new, more conservative justice. As a result, they say, Gender Justice may have to rely more on Minnesota's state civil rights laws, or simply press on with what the attorneys call "impact litigation" — cases that may not always win in court but can affect public opinion. "Every time people see a trans person as a real person who deserves to be treated with dignity if they go seek health care, or if they are a kindergartner in public school, I think that makes it harder to have [a] retrenchment in federal rights," Gaulding said in a recent interview. The case of Jakob Rumble illustrates the crossroads they face. The transgender man from West St. Paul claims he was mistreated by an emergency room doctor in Edina, and with help from Gender Justice brought a claim under an ACA provision that bars discrimination on the basis of gender. In a 63-page ruling believed to be the first federal court analysis of the provision, U.S. District Judge Susan Richard Nelson wrote in March 2015 that Rumble's attorneys had built a plausible case. But last week, the judge put part of the lawsuit on hold, citing a nationwide injunction issued by a Texas judge halting enforcement of the provision, and a separate case awaiting Supreme Court review next month on whether a federal prohibition against discrimination "on the basis of sex" covers gender identity. However, Nelson refused to stay Rumble's claims under the Minnesota Human Rights Act, which offers broad protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation. The case is pending, with a hearing in St. Paul scheduled later this month. Unconscious bias? Gaulding, who studied cognitive science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before beginning her legal career, still draws on her science background to frame some of Gender Justice's work in "thinking about where bias really comes from … on a scientific level: how our brains store up notions of bias and how they act them out and what we can do about that." Stratton came from the University of Minnesota Law School, where she directed the Workers' Rights Clinic, and has continued to specialize in labor rights, winning cases for undocumented workers and women in male-dominated fields. The "implicit bias" strategy they have pursued is an approach at the center of landmark cases that have reached the nation's highest court — with varying degrees of success. Effective testimony from experts on implicit, or unconscious, bias can educate both judge and jury on how human thinking can color behavior and perceptions of inequality, said Eugene Borgida, a U psychology and law professor. "We're not trying to tell the jury how … to decide," Borgida said, "[instead] it is to say humans think about others in these ways." But, Borgida noted, the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia chilled such efforts in 2011, when he rejected testimony from a prominent sociology professor for failing to draw a direct line between the corporate culture at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and its employment decisions related to a potential class of more than 1.5 million plaintiffs. Last fall, Gender Justice sued on behalf of Kimberly Brinkman, one of just two female journeymen among the more than 400 members of the Sprinkler Fitters Local 417 union. Brinkman has struggled to find work throughout her 18-year career. Brinkman, who proudly counts big building projects like the Xcel Energy Center and Minneapolis' Guthrie Theater on her résumé, twice lost her home and had to rely on retirement savings to make ends meet before she decided to sue the union and a contractor, alleging sex discrimination and retaliation. "I didn't embrace the situation," she said. "The situation embraced me. I'm willing to do this for my sister behind me so she doesn't have to go through what I endured." Defense attorneys have asked that Brinkman's suit be dismissed because it was filed outside of a limitations period. The union's lawyer also argued that her suit didn't state a "plausible claim" that her union breached its duty by not filing a grievance on her behalf or that it could be held liable for employers' or co-workers' conduct on the job. The complaint, the attorney wrote in a court filing, "offers only threadbare legal conclusions." 'These are not safe cases' Gender Justice isn't the only nonprofit taking up cases involving gender and sexuality. Larger nonprofit groups like Lambda Legal and the American Civil Liberties Union have pursued major cases. On the other end of the ideological spectrum, the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom supports religious freedom suits such as the case brought by a St. Cloud couple challenging the constitutionality of a state law that says they can't deny wedding videography services to same-sex couples. But Gender Justice attorneys say its nonprofit status helps it take cases of single defendants that are not guaranteed to produce lucrative judgments, and it looks for cases that address all forms of gender equality. "I think we are trying to take cases that would not have been taken but for us," Stratton said. "These are not safe cases, we are not taking on well-trod definitions of the law. We're trying to push law to recognize reality, social science, science." Since the election of Donald Trump, Gender Justice has noticed a slight uptick in donations, though not as much as more established groups such as the ACLU and Planned Parenthood, said executive director Megan Peterson, who previously helped lead the National Network for Abortion Funds. Instead, Peterson said, she saw a series of repeat donations from typical benefactors and a noticeable increase in new donations: Peterson said 65 percent of donations to Gender Justice in 2016 and all of last month's gifts have come from new donors. "I think that shows some of the anxiety that people have, in feeling that donations are a way to channel some potential positive change into the world," Peterson said. " 'We need you now more than ever' is not just a fundraising slogan at this moment." The group's work has also drawn attention from private attorneys such as Katherine Barrett Wiik, of Robins Kaplan in Minneapolis, who volunteered to help represent Rumble in his suit. "Most clients don't bring a lawsuit if they're not ready to create change," Barrett Wiik said. "It's a very public decision motivated by the idea that 'I want people to understand that I'm here, and other people like me are here.' " Twitter: @smontemayor stephen.montemayor@startribune.com 612-673-1755 http://twitter.com/smontemayor More from Star Tribune Vikings release offensive linemen Fusco and Harris Wells Fargo dropping coin-counting machines from lobbies in Minn.

  You are here: Home > Opinion > Editor's Pick How China will come out ahead in a trade war By Winter Nie 0 Comment(s)Print E-mail Shanghai Daily, February 6, 2017 Adjust font size: The target [By Zhai Haijun / China.org.cn] During his election campaign, President Donald Trump threatened to impose 35 to 45 percent tariffs on Chinese imports to force China into renegotiating its trade balance with the US. The immediate result of that would be a fierce trade war that America would almost certainly lose. Trump is now entering uncharted waters. He has already demonstrated his ignorance of Asian affairs in a number of recent developments. For the moment, China has decided to wait for the US to make the first move. A trade war would be problematic for the region, not least for South East Asia, which would be most likely to suffer negative fallout as a major trade partner to both the US and to China. But it would not be a disaster for China, mainly because the US needs China more than vice versa. Unfortunately for Trump, it's not the 80s anymore. Twenty years ago, the situation might have been different. China was dramatically underdeveloped, and it wanted access to Western technology and manufacturing techniques. China has most of what it needs now, and what it doesn't have it can easily obtain from vendors outside the US. The fastest growing markets for the best items China produces, like laptop computers and cell phones, are in developing regions such as India, Latin America and Africa. In contrast, China itself is a market that the US can hardly ignore. By the end of 2015, Chinese consumers had bought 131 million iPhones. The total sales to US customers during the same period stood at only 110 million. And iPhones are only a small part of US exports. Boeing, which employs 150,000 workers in the US, estimates that China will buy some 6,810 airplanes over the next 20 years, and that market alone will be worth more than US$1 trillion. Were Trump to start a trade war, the most immediate effects would probably be felt by companies like Walmart, which import billions of dollars of cheap goods that are bought mostly by the people who voted Trump into office. The prices on almost all of these items would quickly skyrocket beyond the reach of the lower economic brackets — not because of manufacturing costs, but because of the tariffs. The result would be an economic war of attrition that China is infinitely better positioned to win. China's foreign currency reserves now stand at about US$3 trillion. In contrast, the US has foreign exchange reserves that hover at around US$120 billion. Trump's tariffs would automatically trigger penalties against the US in the World Trade Organization (WTO), and might even lead to the WTO's collapse, which would lead to higher tariffs against US exports. While it might take a while for that to happen, the turmoil would be catastrophic for American business and employment. China, on the other hand, would emerge relatively unscathed. In fact, the importance of the US-China relationship is already being challenged by other players. Apple's iPhone sales in China are running into competition from local Chinese manufacturers, and Samsung is more than happy to fill any void that the Chinese can't deal with. Likewise, the Chinese would happily shift their trillion dollars in future aircraft purchases to Airbus, a European firm that is already building a plant in China to finish assembly of large, twin-aisle jets. Both China and leading economic experts hope that a trade war won't happen. The American political system is relatively mature with checks and balances, but with a president who often acts uniquely based on his own beliefs regarding complex issues, almost anything is possible.
