Joe Tenebruso (TMFGuardian) Aug 21, 2016 at 2:47PM Image source: Wal-Mart Stores. Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) reported fiscal 2017 second-quarter results on Aug. 18. The retail giant saw its e-commerce sales growth rate accelerate, and the company boosted its profit outlook for the year ahead. Wal-Mart Stores results: The raw numbers Metric  Q2 2017 Q2 2016 Growth (YOY) Revenue $120.854 billion $120.229 billion 0.5% Net Income $3.773 billion $3.475 billion 8.6% Earnings Per Share $1.21 $1.08 12% Data source: Wal-Mart Stores' Q2 2017 earnings press release. YOY = year over year. What happened with Wal-Mart Stores this quarter? Total revenue rose less than 1% to $121 billion, and 2.8% on a constant currency basis. U.S. comparable-store sales edged up 1.6% -- making Q2 2017 Wal-Mart's eighth consecutive quarter of positive comps -- as traffic increased 1.2%. The performance of Wal-Mart's smaller-format Neighborhood Market stores was again a source of strength, with comps increasing 6.5%. These rising comps helped fuel a 3.1% year-over-year increase in Wal-Mart's U.S. sales to $76.2 billion. However, sales at Sam's Club fell, decreasing 1.3% to $14.5 billion. Wal-Mart's international sales also declined, falling 6.6% to $28.6 billion, as foreign currency fluctuations once again dampened results. Excluding the negative impact of these foreign exchange rate movements, Wal-Mart's international sales rose 2.2% to $31.3 billion. Importantly, global e-commerce sales increased 11.8% on a constant-currency basis, as Wal-Mart continues to invest heavily in this area, including its recent $3 billion deal for Jet.com. "We remain focused on building e-commerce capabilities globally and executing our omni-channel plan, as evidenced by our recent alliance with JD.com in China and agreement to acquire Jet.com in the U.S.," said CEO Doug McMillon in a press release. "Walmart is uniquely positioned to provide customers with a seamless shopping experience where we save them time and money." Yet this growth has come at a cost. Wal-Mart's e-commerce investments -- along with its decision to boost wages for many of its employees in order to improve morale and, by extension, customer service -- have taken a toll on profits. First-quarter operating income -- adjusted to exclude a one-time gain related to an asset sale -- fell 7.2% to $5.6 billion. Despite the lower profits, Wal-Mart's cash generation remains strong, with the retail giant producing nearly $15 billion in operating cash flow and more than $10 billion in free cash flow in the first half of fiscal 2017. That allowed Wal-Mart to return nearly $3.7 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases during the second quarter. Looking forward In the third quarter, Wal-Mart expects comparable-store sales growth of 1% to 1.5% for its U.S. locations, while Sam's Club comps are forecasted to be "slightly positive" when excluding the effects of fuel sales. The company also anticipates third-quarter earnings per share will be between $0.90 and $1.00. Additionally, Wal-Mart raised its fiscal 2017 full-year adjusted EPS forecast to $4.15 to $4.35, up from its prior guidance of $4.00 to $4.30. "I'm pleased with the momentum in the business," added McMillon. "We have a plan, and we are executing against it and customers are responding favorably."

Two decades after Simon began assembling a small empire of natural foodstuffs, Hain is enjoying a bountiful season. Sales are rising 20%-plus as it fills new distribution channels and builds on its well-known Celestial Seasonings tea offerings by acquiring trendier items like The Greek Gods yogurt, Sensible Portions veggie snacks, and BluePrint raw juices. Its trajectory and market position have endeared Hain to Wall Street analysts and famished growth-stock investors, who've awarded the stock (ticker: HAIN) a multiple of earnings and cash flow that's 50% higher than its peers. Having tripled in the past three years to $62.20, shares of the Melville, N.Y., company trade at 28 times earnings for the 12 months ended September 2012, and about 17 times free cash flow (after capital expenditures).

Its multiples, however, are lower than those of the natural-food fan's No. 1, Annie's (BNNY). But Hain could find it tough to sustain the growth rate that has propped up its pricey shares. If, for example, competition weighs upon hit products or Hain falls off its acquisition pace, the stock could lose its premium multiple and spill, by our estimate, roughly a third of its value. Too many servings of these health-food shares—however wholesome—can still raise your risk. Enlarge Image Close Stronger competition is definitely on the way in veggie snacks and Greek-style yogurt, categories from which Hain has been getting its organic growth—that's "organic" in the accounting sense of "not acquired." There's also some evidence of what investors might call style drift in Hain's purchases in the U.K. of a half-billion dollars' worth of sandwich and jam products that are not particularly natural. Accretive natural-food acquisitions aren't always available when you need them. Nor is it easy to keep score of the returns on Hain's acquisitions. Simon and his colleagues invite shareholders to heed a measure they call "adjusted net income," which excludes costs like merger fees, severance, product-line "rationalization," and other items that seem to be recurring expenses in a business dedicated to the roll-up acquisition of niche organic-food companies. Incentive compensation for management has been keyed off the adjusted-earnings number, instead of the standard earnings determined by generally recognized accounting principles. Those GAAP earnings were 40% lower than the "adjusted" number in the five fiscal years through June 2012. WHILE FREELY CONCEDING THE CHALLENGES, Simon contends that natural foods are only in their salad days. "We are in the early stages of health and wellness," he says. Teen vegetarians will grow into the next generation of parents who choose baby foods and kids' snacks. One measure of future opportunities: Although California voters only narrowly defeated a proposition to require labeling of genetically modified ingredients, it's possible that other states will embrace GMO-labeling. Hain is already prepared with labels bragging of its GMO-free products. "I've juiced for three days," says Simon, 54, recalling a juice-fast cleansing. "The biggest prevention and biggest cure is what you eat." After working at Slim-Fast Foods and Häagen-Dazs, Simon found the seed for his ambitions in 1993 when he took over a kosher-food business called Kineret. The next year, he bought Hain Pure Foods from Pet Inc. Many acquisitions followed: Terra Chips snacks in 1998, Earth's Best Organic baby food in 1999, and Celestial Seasonings herbal teas in 2000. Enlarge Image Close Under the name Hain Celestial Group, Simon's company did more than a dozen transactions over the ensuing decade—financed with modest levels of borrowing, rather than dilutive stock offerings. Simon and his chief financial officer, Ira Lamel, are proud that they avoided the balance-sheet heroics that brought grief to other acquisitive food companies, such as Diamond Foods (DMND). "Any investment banker that comes in to present a deal to us...his opening line is, 'You're way underleveraged.' " says Lamel. They've examined and declined billion-dollar deals. Hain's moderate growth rate since its creation started to perk up a couple of years ago. Revenue for the fiscal year ended June 2012 was $1.4 billion, almost 25% above the prior year's, with earnings of $79 million, or $1.73 a share, 40% above the previous year's earnings per share, despite a 33-cents-a-share loss from now discontinued operations. Including the just-acquired British jams, revenue for the June 2013 year could approach $1.8 billion, with Hain projecting net around $2.40 (counting the new U.K. spreads). These recent years' strong performance sent the stock on its post-2010 tear. A goodly portion of Hain's recent revenue growth has resulted from new sales channels. In a determined campaign to fill in the white spaces on its distribution map, the company dedicated sales teams to key accounts, including Costco Wholesale (COST), Wal-Mart (WMT), Target TGT 1.1557724412482342% Target Corp.

New outlets led to a nice jump in sales for Hain products like Terra Chips—made from the likes of taro, yucca, and sweet potato—and Garden of Eatin' tortilla chips. Simon aspires to expand Hain's distribution roster, from about a third of all food retailers (as measured by industry sales volume) to half. But after the initial stocking of these mass outlets, Hain will maintain its revenue momentum only if consumers like the stuff enough to drive same-store sales. Enlarge Image Close To be sure, Hain's recent sales strength hasn't all been from channel fill. Hain broadens distribution of its acquired products, but also comes up with new flavors and packaging. Overall sales of Sensible Portions products and The Greek Gods yogurt have more than doubled since Hain bought them two years ago. But looming ahead of these products is big competition. Private-label veggie straws have now appeared at Whole Foods and even Kmart. As Barron's reported last month, industry production of Greek-style yogurt will expand enormously in the next few years ("A High-Stakes Food Fight," Oct. 29). Yoplait vendor General Mills is becoming an aggressive late entrant with Greek-style products. Backed by influential politicians like Senator Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), New York State is helping to add yogurt-factory capacity at Chobani, Fage, and even PepsiCo, which is building a $206 million yogurt plant in a joint venture. And Danone is adding production. In their September-quarter conference call, Hain executives confirmed that yogurt rivals were engaging in "price dealing" or, more plainly, price-cutting. This will likely become more intense as additional production capacity comes online. Simon acknowledges that competition will increase in Hain's categories. "What keeps me up at night?" he asks. "To ensure that we keep ahead of the competition." Hain is feeling the heat in sales of its Soy Dream and West Soy beverages, says Simon. The rival product Silk has fared so well that Dean Foods did an initial public offering of 14% of its WhiteWave Foods unit in October, with plans to distribute its remaining stake to Dean shareholders. Other disappointments for Hain were sandwich and prepared-meal businesses acquired last year in the U.K. and since disposed of as discontinued operations. Fortunately, a single product's underperformance can't sink Hain: Simon notes that no one brand, or customer, represents more than 19% of its sales. Even so, given Hain's reliance on acquisitions for growth, an ill-starred deal makes it harder to keep up the pace. EARNINGS GROWTH IS HARD to pinpoint in an acquisitive company. A good yardstick, suggests CFO Lamel, might be free cash flow—a measure of cash flow from operations, less capital spending. That number has grown nicely in Hain's past five years, from just 11 cents a share in the June 2008 year, to $2.21 in the June 2012 year. But if investors care about all the capital invested in Hain's acquired businesses—including equity, debt, and things like deferred tax liabilities—even those free-cash-flow numbers don't add up to an impressive return on invested capital. Over the same five-year stretch, Hain's free cash flow ROIC averaged a modest 4%. That's better than a Treasury note's return, but well below that of a comparable–and cheaper – food stock like WhiteWave with its 6% ROIC. Simon and his team have done an admirable job of consolidating products whose ingredients are more healthful than conventional fare. If Hain can't maintain true organic profit growth, however, its shares could settle to a more conventional earnings multiple below 20. That would cut the price by about a third and annoy a tough financial-health-conscious customer named Icahn Associates, which owns about 16% of Hain's shares.

Target's online sales growth is slowing while Wal-Mart's has ticked up. Adam Levy (adamlevy) Aug 20, 2016 at 4:00PM Image source: Getty Images. Every year, consumers do more and more of their shopping online. Global online sales grew about 25% last year, according to eMarketer. But some big-box retailers are having trouble keeping up with the market's rapid growth. Target (NYSE:TGT) grew its online sales just 16% last quarter. That's a decline from 30% a year ago. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), among the largest online retailers in the world, grew online sales just 12% last quarter. That's actually an improvement from the previous two quarters when it reported single-digit online sales growth. Both companies are now trailing Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) sales growth, which has accelerated over the last two years. Source: Target, Wal-Mart, Amazon financial reports The steep declines in Target's online sales growth indicate that it's on the same path as Wal-Mart when it comes to digital sales. That's bad news for investors. Here's why. Comparable-sales growth depends on online sales During the fourth quarter last year, Target managed to increase its online sales 34%. Those sales contributed 1.3 percentage points to the company's comparable-store sales growth of 1.9%. With the deceleration in online sales growth to 16% last quarter, comparable store-sales fell 1.1%. Digital sales only contributed 0.5 percentage points to Target's comparable sales growth. Target expects comparable sales to stay negative during the third and fourth quarters. Continued deceleration in online sales will emphasize the decline in foot traffic and sales in Target's brick-and-mortar stores. CEO Brian Cornell told analysts during the second-quarter earnings call that the "number one challenge was traffic." Target must compete against other retailers like Wal-Mart to attract customers to their stores when they could simply go online. Wal-Mart is winning the battle here, having increased traffic to its stores seven straight quarters. Last quarter, traffic increased 1.2% at Wal-Mart's stores. Big investments ahead? Wal-Mart just spent $3.3 billion to acquire Jet.com, a relatively small e-commerce company that launched last year. On top of that, Wal-Mart plans to spend $900 million on its regular e-commerce operations this year and $1.1 billion next year. Those are steep increases from the $700 million the company spent on e-commerce in 2015. It may be too early to tell if Wal-Mart's investments are paying off. Online sales growth recovered last quarter, but growth was still slower than the second quarter of 2015. Target, meanwhile, has already committed to increasing its spend on technology and supply chain infrastructure to support its online sales. The company is investing $1.8 billion in improvements, up from $1 billion last year. Starting in 2017 it expects to invest $2 billion to $2.5 billion per year. Those are significant increases in investments, especially considering the lack of revenue growth at the retailer. But both Target and Amazon are going head-to-head with Amazon in online sales. Amazon continues to invest in growing its retail operations. Amazon spent $1.7 billion on capital expenditures last quarter alone, although a big part of that went to support its AWS cloud computing platform. Still, Amazon is investing in more fulfillment centers to support its growing Prime membership. It's also investing in improving the Prime benefits beyond two-day shipping. On top of all that, Amazon is working to develop new private-label products to undercut pricing at Wal-Mart and Target, which both stock their own private labels as well. Target's ability to capitalize on its investments in online sales will start to show over the next few quarters, but it might not be long before we see online sales growth dip into single digits, putting further pressure on comparable-store sales growth. If Target becomes desperate, we could see it move to make a big acquisition of smaller online retailers or develop strategic partnerships to bolster online sales. Adam Levy owns shares of Amazon.com.

Skip to content INFORMATION NIGERIA Nigeria's No.1 Information Portal Menu Home Trending Metro Entertainment Music Lifestyle Sports World Odd News Education Jobs Man Loses 300 Pounds By Walking To Store For Meals A man from Arizona, USA, who reportedly threw out all his food and committed himself to walking to a local Walmart store and back every time he wanted a meal has lost more than 300 pounds. Pasquale “Pat” Brocco, 31, began a to change his life three years ago when he was warned by his doctor that his weight of 605 pounds and his high blood pressure and high cholesterol put his life in serious danger. Brocco went home from that appointment and took a photo of himself in front of a mirror. “My stomach was down to my thighs. My chest was hanging down here. I was disgusted.” He said. He decided that every time he was hungry, he would walk the 1 mile to his closest Walmart, then back home to eat his meal. In less than two years, he said, he lost 200 pounds. “You walk to Walmart three times a day, and you end up walking 6 miles,” he said. “It’s amazing because I never walked 6 miles in my life, and I was doing it every day.” Brocco put foods like vegetables, meats, sweet potatoes, quinoa and steel-cut oatmeal into his diet and took out the foods he learned over time were hampering his efforts. “Once I figured out dairy was my downfall, I took it out of my diet, and instantly I started losing weight again,” he said. Brocco graduated from walks to Walmart to incline walks on a treadmill at a gym. He also began lifting weights and using gym equipment he previously could not. “I mean, at 600 pounds, I couldn’t even go to the gym. I didn’t fit on the machines,” he said. Now 330 pounds lighter, Brocco said his nickname is no longer Fat Pat. As Possible Pat, he hopes to be a role model for his 1-year-old son. “I’m setting an example for my son so he can be Possible Pat too,” Brocco said. Because he lost so much weight, he had to have about 30 pounds of excess skin removed.

Facebook/PossiblePat By Maggie Maloney Aug 20, 2016 Pasquale "Pat" Brocco, 31, was called "Fat Pat" his entire life. But now, he prefers the nickname "Possible Pat" because of his incredible weight loss journey and his unique fitness plan that helped him lose more than 300 pounds: walking to and from his local Walmart. Three years ago, a doctor warned Brocco that his weight, which was then 605 pounds, as well as his high blood pressure and high cholesterol were extremely dangerous, according to ABC News. Brocco snapped a photo of himself after his appointment, and realized what his body looked like. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below "My stomach was down to my thighs. My chest was hanging down here," Brocco told ABC News. "I was disgusted." To succeed the process must become a rhythm! Rhythm is something done repetitive, so the process must be repetitive!

"You walk to Walmart three times a day, and you end up walking six miles," Brocco said to ABC News. "It's amazing because I never walked six miles in my life, and I was doing it every day." Brocco changed his eating habits by loading up on healthy food — like vegetables, meat, steel-cut oatmeal, and quinoa — while cutting out junk food. He also modified his diet along the way as he discovered what foods were hurting his weight loss goals. "Once I figured out dairy was my downfall, I took it out of my diet, and instantly I started losing weight again," he told ABC News.

Today, Brocco is a full 325 pounds lighter and wants to become a body builder, he wrote on his GoFundMe page. Just this week, he underwent surgery to remove the roughly 30 pounds of excess skin, which he paid for through a GoFundMe and with a discount from his doctor. And now, "Possible Pat" is chronicling his healthy living, workouts, and meals through social media, making for some serious Instagram #fitspo. But his most important role at the moment? Being a role model for his 1-year-old son. "I'm setting an example for my son so he can be Possible Pat, too," Brocco said to ABC News.

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Aug 20, 2016 at 8:06AM Image source: Getty Images. Trying to time the market is a recipe for disaster. But there's nothing wrong with waiting for shares of a great company to be knocked down before pouncing. Some of the best investing opportunities occur because some short-term problem temporarily sours a stock in the minds of investors. Keeping a watch list of stocks that aren't quite cheap enough to buy is a critical tool for capturing those opportunities. We asked three of our top Foolish contributors to discuss a stock that they're watching. Here's what they had to say. Not quite cheap enough Tim Green: When shares of retail behemoth Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) sank last year after its plan to raise wages and invest in initiatives like employee training and e-commerce caused profits to drop, I considered pulling the trigger and buying the stock. While the rise of Amazon.com is a major threat to the company's business model, I think that the market was underestimating Wal-Mart's ability to adapt. Fast-forward to today and investor sentiment has completely shifted. Since hitting bottom in late 2015, the stock has soared nearly 30%. Wal-Mart's results have been better than expected, with comparable sales in its U.S. stores increasing for eight straight quarters. At a time when many retailers are struggling to get shoppers in the door, Wal-Mart's store traffic is rising, thanks in part to the company's initiatives aimed at improving the customer experience. WMT data by YCharts. Wal-Mart has been investing in a variety of e-commerce initiatives, like its online grocery ordering and pickup service. But the recent $3.3 billion acquisition of e-commerce start-up Jet is the company's boldest bet so far. Jet aims to undercut Amazon on price by offering discounts based on the quantity of items purchased. The company is almost certainly burning cash at a blistering pace, but the acquisition gives Wal-Mart an e-commerce brand that could grow very quickly in the coming years, as well as the services of Jet's founder. Wal-Mart expects to produce between $4.15 and $4.35 in adjusted EPS this year, putting the stock price at nearly 17 times the high of that range. That's not particularly cheap, but earnings will be depressed this year due to the company's investments. Still, I try to ensure an adequate margin of safety for all of my investments, and Wal-Mart has gotten just a bit too expensive. If the stock drops on short-term worries in the coming months, I'll be waiting. Watching and waiting Matt DiLallo: After running up 50% since the start of the year, energy infrastructure giant Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) is no longer the screaming bargain it once was. That said, there is certainly the case to be made that it is still on sale, given that shares are down more than 30% over the past year. However, I would rather wait until the next sale before bolstering my position any further. The reason Kinder Morgan's stock ran up so much this year is due to the significant progress it made on fixing its balance sheet problems. The company entered into several strategic transactions to sell or joint venture select assets. Those deals pushed its leverage ratio down to 5.3 times, which is below its year-end target for 5.5 times debt-to-EBITDA. That said, the company will not begin to return more cash to shareholders until its leverage is below 5.0 times debt to EBITDA. Given its current projections, that might not happen until 2018. Because most investors are not that patient, I think they might grow restless, especially if Kinder Morgan does not start hinting that a dividend increase will happen early next year. That is why I am hoping that there just might be another golden opportunity to buy Kinder Morgan's stock in the near future. I could be wrong, and I own enough Kinder Morgan stock to be happy if it keeps going higher, but I would jump at the chance to buy more if the stock suddenly dropped by double digits due to investor impatience.  A risk management expert with a bright future ahead Brian Feroldi: I'm already a happy shareholder of Verisk Analytics (NASDAQ:VRSK), but I'm eagerly waiting for shares to go on sale so I can continue to build upon my small position.   Verisk is a provider of tools and data analytics that help other businesses to measure and manage their risk profile. The company's primary customers are property and casualty insurers, but it is constantly adding new customers from other markets outside of the insurance sector that afford it plenty of long-term growth opportunities.    Though Verisk might sound like a boring business to own, it exhibits many traits that make for an excellent long-term investment. For one, more than 80% of the company's revenue is subscription-based, and since Verisk boasts stellar retention rates, its top line is highly predictable. In addition, as a data provider, it costs the company very little to service additional customers, which allows Verisk to grow its profits at a faster rate than its revenue.   VRSK Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Lastly, the company's data is proprietary and dates back to 1971, which gives it a huge leg up over competitors. And since its services are mission critical to its customers, Verisk can push along regular price increases without much fuss.    All in all, Verisk is an extremely high-quality company with an enduring moat that I think should be able to grow at an above-average rate for years to come. I'd love to add to my position today, but the company's shares are currently trading for about 27 times full-year earnings estimates, hinting that they are a little bit pricey right now. However, if this stock were to suddenly go on sale, you can bet that I'd happily step in and buy shares at a discount. Brian Feroldi owns shares of Amazon.com, Kinder Morgan, and Verisk Analytics. Brian Feroldi has the following options: short January 2018 $30 puts on Kinder Morgan, short January 2018 $35 puts on Kinder Morgan, long January 2017 $35 calls on Kinder Morgan, and short January 2017 $35 puts on Kinder Morgan. Matt DiLallo owns shares of Amazon.com, Kinder Morgan, and Verisk Analytics, and has the following options: short January 2018 $30 puts on Kinder Morgan, long January 2018 $30 calls on Kinder Morgan, long January 2017 $55 calls on Wal-Mart Stores, and short January 2017 $70 calls on Wal-Mart Stores.

It happened Sunday night at the Walmart on North Memorial Drive. In the video taken by Richelle Stewart, a Walmart employee is seen trying to grab the monkey that had apparently escaped from a camper. A woman runs toward the employee and Monkey, saying “Let him go, let him go, let him go! If he bites you, they will put him down.” The woman then walks across the parking lot toward a camper parked nearby. According to the Lancaster Eagle Gazette, someone called police and said that the monkey bit the employee, but he did not require medical attention.

BUSINESS BOOKS 10 Critical Questions You Must Answer if You Want to Write a Book Don't skip any of these questions if you want your book to be extremely successful. By David Van Rooy David Van Rooy is the author of "Trajectory: 7 Career Strategies to Take You From Where You Are to Where You Want to Be" (2014, AMACOM). He explores the concept of career trajectory and how you can take advantage of your skills and the possibilities around you to reach your goals. He is currently Senior Director, Global Leadership Development at Walmart. He previously held roles in International HR and was also responsible for the worlds largest performance management and employee engagement programs at Walmart, covering approximately 2.2 million employees globally. Before Walmart, David held leadership roles at Marriott International and Burger King Corporation. He has a Ph.D. in Industrial and Organizational Psychology and has published over 20 peer reviewed scientific business articles and book chapters. @dlvanrooy @dlvanrooy WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement After my book was released, I was surprised by how many people asked me for advice on how to write and publish a book. Like all authors I learned a lot along the way. Here are 10 critical questions you must answer and tradeoffs to consider if you decide to write a book. 1. Publisher or self-publish: The publishing world has changed dramatically in recent years and the Internet has made self-publishing considerably easier. If you self-publish you have full control of your book, but also bear all costs. A publisher is harder to secure and will have control over some decisions, but also absorbs many costs (e.g., printing, distribution, cover art) and also gains access to critical distribution channels, including identifying outlets to review your book ; 2. Agent or no agent: With an agent you give a portion of your royalties to them. Literary agents work on a commission basis and are incented to find you the best deal so that their payout increases when you sell books. Though you give up some of your royalties, an agent is often your best chance to get your book proposal reviewed by a major publishing house. 3. Publicist or no publicist: Publicists bring access that is hard for many people to get on their own. They identify media outlets such as television shows, newspapers, and podcasts to bring valuable exposure to you and your book. The best publicists can cost tens of thousands of dollars and you will have to consider if their services are worth it to you. 4. What is the book's "hook": Every book needs a quick and compelling hook that captures attention. This is always needed to draw in potential readers/buyers, but also literary agents, publishers, and publicists if you go that route. 5. Who is the target audience: Don't try to pretend your book is for everyone - all books have a more targeted market. If you decide to use a publisher they will want to know exactly whom you are targeting and how big the audience is. They will also want to know how your book is different from similar books that have been written and if it has relevance to sell outside your home country. The target audience will also help you decide who to ask to "blurb" or endorse your book. 6. Write or ghost write: You would be surprised how many books are written by someone other than the stated author. Ghost writers are sought after and can make anyone come across as a gifted writer. Authors may not have time to write a book or find that a professional writer is better able to capture the voice they want to convey. 7. What is my platform: This one must be alive well before you publish your book. You must consider the best way to bring visibility to your book and contemplate platform options such as your standing as a well-known expert, your social media presence, professional speeches, access to different constituencies, etc. 8. What are my goals: Consider the reason you are writing a book to help hone your focus, especially because the outcomes are not always connected. You might want to make a lot of money but not care about getting great reviews. You way just want to build your brand by getting your name out there. You may want to achieve critical acclaim for your book even if it doesn't make a lot of money (think Indie films). Not everyone can be a NYT best selling author, but you can be pleased with the outcome if you know your goals in advance. 9. What format will the book be: You have many options. It can be hard cover, paperback, eBook, audio, small, large, etc. If you self-publish consider the costs of developing multiple formats, particularly hard cover and paperback. 10. How much time will you commit: The reality is that a book once published is there forever. In addition to the time it takes to write (or work with a ghost writer) you will also need to spend time promoting the book. You must consider you ability and willingness to travel, speak, go to book signings, and otherwise invest your time to market and sell your book. No series of decisions is right for everyone and you must consider your particular situation and goals. One last tip: don't get too fixated on the title of your book - it often changes as the writing process progresses, especially when you have a publisher and and edi.

It's a divisive issue and one some Warrenton residents share with people in other communities across the country who oppose the big-box behemoth for a variety of reasons. In fact, even a quick glance at the internet brings up a host of websites that are dedicated to nothing other than keeping Walmart out of those communities. But despite opposition by the Clatsop Residents Against Walmart group and others who spoke against the mega-retailer at this past week's City Commission meeting, Warrenton commissioners made the right decision in renewing Walmart's site design permit for another year. The approval marked the third time the permit has been extended. The decision of whether Walmart could build in Warrenton was originally made in 2013 when the commission first granted the retailer's land-use permit. That 2013 decision later drew a federal lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that claimed the agency failed to protect wetlands in its review and approval of a wetland fill permit application by Peaksview LLC. Peaksview owns land that Walmart plans to build on at Ensign Lane and U.S. Highway 101 in the North Coast Retail Center. The suit stalled Walmart's plans until two weeks ago when a federal judge dismissed the case. The delay, however, forced Walmart to ask for the third extension of its permit. While in past votes commissioners had been unanimous in their approval, this time it wasn't a slam dunk. Commissioners voted 3-1 in favor with one commissioner absent from the meeting. The "no" vote is a bit puzzling and came from Commissioner Rick Newton, who said after the meeting that he opposed the extension because "I don't think it will make life better in Warrenton." Newton had previously voted "yes" last year on the extension issue. Despite the flip-flop, the extension approval this past week was right for several reasons. Whether Warrenton should have a Walmart or not was really decided when the city first began allowing big-box stores. That policy was reaffirmed with the original approval of Walmart's land use permit and then reinforced by the two additional extensions prior to last week's action. And, importantly, Walmart thus far has met each legal requirement to build and open in Warrenton, barring a successful appeal of the judge's dismissal of the lawsuit. Doing an about-face on the issue now, despite its divisiveness, is a form of discrimination and protectionism that government has no business in practicing. Governments make overall policy, and consumers, through freedom of choice, ultimately determine a business's success by making decisions with their feet on where they shop.

Nathan Frandino reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript It was just another day off for registered nurse Letty Rubalcava. Until she walked into the bathroom at this California Walmart. (SOUNDBITE) (English) LETTY RUBALCAVA, REGISTERED NURSE, SAYING: "There was two employees kind of standing outside of a stall. One of them had a cellphone an I could hear there was somebody inside the bathroom stall that sounded really agitated, kind of grunting." That's when the nurse of 10 years took charge of the familiar situation. (SOUNDBITE) (English) LETTY RUBALCAVA, REGISTERED NURSE, SAYING: "I said I'm a labor and delivery nurse and then that's when they opened the bathroom door for me and I assisted her to the floor, and then I asked for blankets. I kind of went into auto-pilot." With the help of an obstetrician tech who happened to be nearby, Rubalcava helped calm the mother until the paramedics arrived to help with the delivery. (SOUNDBITE) (English) LETTY RUBALCAVA, REGISTERED NURSE, SAYING: "Baby girl delivered easily and I kind of placed her skin to skin with mom. I love to be able to help moms everyday help them bring new life into this world." The baby was born prematurely but she and the mother are now doing well. (SOUNDBITE) (English) LETTY RUBALCAVA, REGISTERED NURSE, SAYING: "When I walked out of the Walmart bathroom there were some employees that clapped and somebody you know they were calling me an angel and that was very sweet you know but I just felt like I'm here at the right place at the right time." Rubalcava says she hopes to reconnect with the new mom and baby soon.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States How Analysts View Wal-Mart After Earnings By Paul Ausick August 21, 2016 10:35 am EST Print Email Tweet In the same week that Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) reported quarterly results, the retail giant also announced the $3 billion acquisition of e-commerce website Jet.com. By the time the acquisition was announced, it had been on investors’ radar for a few days and had weighed on the stock price. The earnings announcement pushed shares to a new 52-week high on Thursday, but by Friday’s close shares had retreated again. Wal-Mart posted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.21 on total revenues of $120.85 billion, which includes membership fees in Sam’s Club. Second-quarter results beat Thomson Reuters consensus estimates for EPS of $1.02 and $120.16 billion in revenue. Wal-Mart also raised its full-year EPS estimate from a prior range of $4.00 to $4.30 to a new range of $4.15 to $4.25. Analyst reactions were nearly uniformly positive, although most adjustments were to price targets only while ratings were left alone. One exception was S&P Global, which raised its rating from Buy to Strong Buy and lifted its price target from $82 to $88. The firm’s analysts noted: We see higher wages, inventory improvements and the expansion of online offerings and in-store pick-up services supporting continued favorable U.S. comparable store sales and e-commerce sales trends. We expect sales growth to fuel an acceleration in price cuts. Commenting on its Hold rating on Wal-Mart stock, the Argus analyst said: We are optimistic about the company’s new plan to invest more in its staff. Based on the stores we visit, the company has a significant opportunity – and need – to provide better in-store service, have the shelves better stocked, and have faster checkout times. The challenge for management will be to make sure that a better shopping experience translates into attractive returns on incremental investments. Analysts at Merrill Lynch were less sanguine. The firm rates the stock Neutral, but did lift the price target from $72 to $76: Near-term investments should limit the earnings benefits of positive US same-store sales and traffic, better merchandising execution globally, and a more integrated e-commerce business. Longer-term global sales and profit growth should return as WMT leverages its significant investments on people, technology and price. Other analysts’ actions included the following: Baird raised its price target from $75 to $80 and rates the stock Outperform. Deutsche Bank lifted its price target from $77 to $79 with a Hold rating. Jefferies rates the stock a Buy and raised its price target from $85 to $86. RBC raised its price target from $73 to $76 and rates the stock Underperform. Telsey Advisory rates the shares as Market Perform and raised its price target from $71 to $78. Wal-Mart stock closed at $72.81 on Friday, down 2% for the day. The 52-week range is $56.30 to $75.19, and the 12-month price target is $72.64. The latest ratings may not yet be included in the consensus price target.

Published Aug 21st, 2016 8:56 am roby@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Mike Malone, the outgoing CEO of the Northwest Arkansas Council, said that while regional workforce needs are pivotal to continuing the area’s momentum, he’s also certain that improving the Arkansas’ national image will be critical for future growth across the state. Malone, who appeared on this week’s edition of Talk Business & Politics, announced last week that he will be stepping down from the influential Northwest Arkansas Council after nearly 10 years at the helm. The powerful and influential business group has been a driving force in infrastructure development, regional amenities, and a coordinated vision for growing Northwest Arkansas. Malone will leave the group to work with Tom and Steuart Walton, grandsons of Wal-Mart founders Sam and Helen Walton, who have a variety of entrepreneurial and quality of life projects underway in the state. With Northwest Arkansas experiencing low unemployment, Malone contends that employers are not satisfied with the region’s strong position and are eager to capitalize on the momentum. “The unemployment rate is at 3.1%. That sounds good, but I’ve got employers saying, ‘Where are the next wave of workers coming from? We want to expand. Give us some workforce.'” said Malone. With Wal-Mart, Tyson Foods, J.B. Hunt and the University of Arkansas driving much of the economic engine of Northwest Arkansas, Malone said that diversification has been a big part of the conversation on how to continue the region’s growth, which has seen an average of 30 new residents on daily. “The economy has really been built on retail, food and logistics and then industries and services that have built up around that. That’s been a great run. Those will continue to be our growth sectors, but we think we can diversify around that,” he said. “So, IT and the startup community has certainly been a point of emphasis over the last five years… we think we’re already starting to see some diversification because of some of the startups that are starting to scale.” With recent investments and announcements from Northwest Health System, Washington Regional, Arkansas Children’s Hospital and Mercy Health, Malone sees another big regional challenge in the health care sector. “There’s a half a billion dollars worth of health care construction underway in the region right now. $500 million. There’s a massive investment in health care if we can find the workforce. That becomes the next challenge,” said Malone. While Northwest Arkansas has been a driver for the state’s overall economy, Malone said he and others recognize that the rest of the state is needed to help the region sustain growth, especially when it comes to outsiders’ perceptions of Arkansas. “These are 100 years, or maybe 200 years of folks elsewhere making fun of us or having these myths and misperceptions about Arkansas. We need – because we’re trying to attract talent and businesses – and the rest of the state needs – because we’re all trying to attract talent and business – an enhancement in our reputation. Some of that’s on us. We can do a better job of selling ourselves,” he said. Malone added: “I’m real encouraged by what this [Hutchinson] administration is doing with more money for marketing economic development, partnerships between economic development and parks and tourism marketing. I think we all own a piece of that. We’re all humble and shy and kind of play along with the jokes they make about Arkansas. It’s time to change that. Let’s stand up and show how dynamic and what a great place it is in which to live.” You can watch his full interview in the video below.

While Meijer still sees stores as large as the one that opened this month in Flat Rock (shown here) as central to its future, it is looking for new locations in cramped urban areas and considering what a smaller store might look like. Meijer Inc. is still betting big on the big box. Competitors such as Wal-Mart and Target are experimenting with smaller stores in an effort to draw millennials and fit stores into more compact urban footprints. But the pioneer of that type of superstore still sees stores the size of three or four football fields, like one that opened in Flat Rock earlier this month, as central to its future. That's not to say Meijer isn't hedging its bets. Company officials say it is looking for new locations in urban areas and taking another run at what a store about half the size of a typical Meijer might look like. One thing the company says isn't happening, though, is a rumored store in the district surrounding the new Little Caesars Arena in Detroit. The privately held, family-owned retailer, based in Walker — with revenue of $16.1 billion according to Forbes — was being courted to open a smaller store to fit into the Woodward Square area of The District Detroit, which immediately surrounds the forthcoming Little Caesars Arena in downtown Detroit, Crain's reported in January. However, Hank Meijer, CEO of the retailer, said at the Meijer store opening in Flat Rock: "We don't have any specific plans for (The District Detroit). We know that at some point it would be important for us to have a smaller format that could take advantage of other opportunities, but we're not there yet." Frank Guglielmi, senior director for communications for Meijer, added: "That's a rumor. We don't know where that started, but we were all scratching our heads as to where that rumor came from. We think it's because we're a major partner with the Detroit Red Wings. So a lot of people said, 'Oh, they must be putting a store there.'?" Still, Meijer is thinking about smaller stores. The retailer's first 102,000-square-foot mini-supercenter in Niles, Ill., a suburb of Chicago, closed in June after opening about six years ago. The retailer has opened four approximately 100,000-square-foot stores offering predominantly food, and has plans to open a similarly sized concept close to home in Grand Rapids in 2018 at the earliest. How Meijer's forthcoming Grand Rapids store could differ from the closed mini-supercenter in Niles is unclear. Meijer's mini-supercenters are about half the size of a typical store. "We have committed to opening a smaller format store in Grand Rapids, in an urban project that we hope we'll learn from," Meijer said. "We've still got a lot of work to do on that one. We hope that will begin to give us a model to put in other areas." Guglielmi said it's important to keep in mind that Meijer's "smaller" stores are still relatively large, and consumers won't see the retailer doing a 20,000- to 30,000-square-foot concept that would fit neatly into a big city's downtown. He said the reason Meijer's prices are lower for groceries compared with traditional supermarkets is because there are higher profit margins for general merchandise. Smaller stores make that difficult because the stores can't stock as much. "Never say never, but I think you'll see traditional Meijers around Detroit before you see smaller ones," Guglielmi added. That's because Meijer's two supercenters in Detroit — one at the Gateway Marketplace development at Eight Mile Road and Woodward Avenue and the other in northwest Detroit where Redford High School once stood at Grand River Avenue and McNichols Road — have been successful, especially the supercenter at the Gateway Marketplace, the first store Meijer opened in Detroit. Photo by Adrienne Roberts Hundreds of people gathered for the opening of the Meijer in Flat Rock recently. The stores have done so well, in fact, that the company is looking at other locations in the city, such as along Jefferson Avenue between I-375 and Grosse Pointe Park, Crain's has reported. Meijer had no updates on the reported plans. Guglielmi said that when looking for a location to build a new store, Meijer looks at a combination of population density, traffic patterns and distance from competitors. "We continue to be very excited about Detroit," Meijer said. "Our competitors are making big investments here, too, but we want to build share, and that's our goal." Despite recent efforts by retailers to move away from the big-box format, Ken Dalto, founder and owner of Farmington Hills-based business consulting firm Kenneth J. Dalto & Associates, said Meijer does well when it opens its typical large superstores in underserved areas. The three areas of growth for big-box retailers are in online sales, opening smaller stores and building stores in areas that lack a variety of retail and grocery options, he said. While Target Corp. has succeeded in capturing millennials' dollars online and opening smaller-footprint stores (the retailer has used names such as TargetExpress and CityTarget for these concepts), Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Meijer have done well opening in underserved areas, such as in northwest Detroit, or certain areas of northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula. He said Target has captured millennial dollars because it's seen as a one-stop shop for food, name-brand clothing, home improvement products, small appliances and pharmacy needs. "When people tell you they're going to Target, they have everything, (and shoppers are) going to get everything," Dalto said. He said that while Meijer has similar offerings, it's still viewed primarily as a place to buy groceries. Cindy Ciura, principal of CC Consulting in Bloomfield Hills, said another challenge for Meijer opening a smaller-footprint store is that shoppers choose to go to a Meijer because "the selection is amazing, there are such wide varieties, and they buy so deep." She said that when Meijer tries to fill more of a niche for shoppers with its grocery-focused mini-supercenters, it's a case of "stores trying to be something that they're not," and consumers don't latch on to the concept easily. She said niche retailers like the discount supermarket chain Aldi or Trader Joe's, Whole Foods or a smaller-footprint Target (because it's "nimble") would do well in downtown Detroit. "(Retailers are) tempted to want to do something (in downtown Detroit because) it's so under-groceried, and they want to capture that market," Ciura said.

Lester Brown, 39, from Manor in Texas, paid teacher Sabrina Drude's $97 bill at a Wal-Mart store near San Antonio, Texas, after he noticed her going through the checkout with lots of school supplies but no children. Drude, 23, explained that she was buying them for her students who come from an underprivileged area and often cannot afford supplies, at which point Brown offered to pay for them. Sabrina Drude, 23, a teacher from San Antonio, Texas, praised Lester Brown, 39, a former minister, after he paid for school supplies she was buying for underprivileged students Drude said she burst into tears after Brown approached her at the cash register in Wal-Mart to ask why she was buying so much stationery, then offered to pay for all of it The teacher thanked Brown for his kind gesture, but said she would not feel comfortable accepting his money. Drude ran her shopping through the till and was going to get her purse out as $97 flashed up on the display, but Brown got there first.

Share this article Share 16 shares 'He said "put your wallet away" and I just started crying,' Drude told CBS News. 'That's the sweetest thing I've ever heard.' When she asked him why he was being so kind, Brown responded: 'Because teachers don’t get the recognition that they deserve.' Brown, who is a former minister and is currently a crisis worker, told KENS5: 'It was the right thing to do. It’s what God said to do and it’s that simple. Brown said that he had been carrying a $100 bill around in his wallet waiting for an opportunity to give it to a worthy cause, 'and God said to respond' Drude said she chooses to buy equipment for her students because she doesn't want them to suffer the embarrassment of not being to afford it 'I remember I had this hundred-dollar bill with the intention of responding to something in need, and God said to respond. 'I challenge you, whatever it is you can afford, to volunteer at a school, help a family. You want people to live better, love thy neighbor.  'Love thy neighbor means do your part.' Drude said that while it is not a requirement for teachers to supply their pupils, she does so out of her own pocket so they don't have to deal with the embarrassment of their parents not being able to afford it. She added that she will be telling her students about Brown's kind act in the hope it inspires them: 'This is exactly the type of person I want to influence my kids to be.  'I want him to inspire my kids just like he inspired me; if any of my kids grew up to be half the man he is I’d be very proud.'

Matika previously were sentenced on Thursday. Dylan Lewis Rahmann, 24, of Saylorsburg, was sentenced to placement in the state’s Intermediate Punishment program in two cases on charges of false reports to law enforcement and contraband — controlled substance in a prison. The false ID count stems from a vehicle stop where he gave the wrong name. The drug count stems from an incident in April 2015 at the county prison where he was involved in bringing drugs into the prison. His placement in the state program is for two years. The program involves seven months in prison, a period of time in an intensive drug rehabilitation program and then time in a halfway house. If he fails to complete it he will be brought back and resentenced by Matika. Kathleen Ann Kattner, 45, of Palmerton, was placed on probation for two years on charges of simple assault and resisting arrest. The incident occurred Nov. 12, 2014, in the area of 901 Princeton Ave. in Palmerton. Police were dispatched to the area for a disturbance. On scene they found Kattner involved in the disturbance. When attempting to take her into custody, she kicked officer Shawn Leadbetter. Police also had to use substantial force to place her in the police cruiser. She admitted to a long-term alcohol and drug abuse problem and said most of her criminal record is due to it. She is facing sentencing in September on other criminal charges she previously pleaded to. Matika ordered her to get both drug and alcohol and mental health evaluations, zero tolerance for drug and alcohol use, and render 100 hours of community service. She is currently an inmate in the county prison on the other charges. Jason Paul Schmidt, 39, of West Hazleton, was sentenced to serve three to one day less 24 months in the county prison on charges of retail theft and theft. He was charged by Mahoning Township police for two incidents at Walmart on Aug. 26 and 30, 2015. He was also ordered to make total restitution of $1,691.98 to Walmart, get a mental health evaluation, and stay out of the Walmart store. He was given credit for four days spent in jail on the charges. He will begin the jail term at noon on Aug. 9 and serve it on consecutive two-day weekends. Ronald David Getz, 45, of Lehighton, was sentenced to serve 30 days to one year in prison on a charge of simple assault. He was charged by Lansford police for an incident at the borough’s midrise on Aug. 14, 2015. Getz admitted getting into an altercation with Dale Miles in the lobby area of the building. Getz said that Miles was “stalking” his then girlfriend. Miles, who was in court, denied that and said he never saw Getz before when he suddenly punched him in the face while entering an elevator at the midrise, knocking out one of his teeth. Matika said he was concerned about Getz’s prior record and felt a prison term was needed. Getz was also ordered to render 50 hours of community service when paroled, zero tolerance imposed on drug or alcohol use and have no contact with the victim. Due to pending health-related matters, Getz will not begin the jail term until 5 p.m. Sept. 30 and serve it on consecutive weekends. Samantha Nicole Gulla, 30, of Bel Alton, Maryland, and formerly of Lansford, was sentenced to serve a total one to 12 months in prison on charges of endangering the welfare of a child and DUI. She was stopped on July 5, 2015, along Bertsch Street by Lansford police. Police were originally dispatched for a domestic dispute and on scene spoke with Gulla, who had gone to a Bertsch Street residence with her 3-year-old son to see his father. She admitted driving to the residence with the child in the car while under the influence. She refused to submit to a blood test. She was also ordered to get a drug and alcohol evaluation, zero tolerance for drug and alcohol use, render a total of 100 hours of community service, pay a fine of $1,500, and have her license suspended for 18 months. She was given credit for 30 days spent in an inpatient rehab program and paroled. All defendants must also pay court costs of about $1,000 and a $50 per month supervision fee while on parole or probation.

REUTERS/Nacho Doce/FilesMore By Nandita Bose (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings on Thursday, saying it benefited from cleaner and more efficient U.S. stores, investments in technology that improved online shopping and higher employee wages that fostered better customer service. The world's largest retailer has been spending heavily to entice consumers back to its stores with better stocked shelves, and improving its e-commerce business by investing in new warehouses that can deliver online shipments faster. Last week, it announced the acquisition of online startup Jet.com for over $3 billion to better compete with Amazon.com Inc . Wal-Mart also increased entry level wages to $10 an hour earlier this year and said it will invest $2.7 billion in employee compensation and training over two years, a move it said contributed to improved service in its stores. These steps, analysts said, helped Wal-Mart to raise its fiscal-year forecast and buck a string of weak results from higher-end brick-and-mortar competitors like Target Corp , Macy's Inc and Kohls Corp . Target cut its fiscal-year profit outlook on Wednesday after quarterly sales fell more than expected. Wal-Mart U.S. Chief Executive Officer Greg Foran said on a conference call that the company's customers were still cautious with their spending but were visiting stores more often and buying more items. Store visits increased 1.2 percent, and the average size of an order rose 0.4 percent during the second quarter ended on July 31. "We are seeing a steady improvement in the U.S. business, and it is responding favourably to the changes we are making," he said. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company said sales were strong for grocery items and apparel but weak for electronics. "Walmart's strategic investments are generating traction, which is especially meaningful, given a large portion of its customer base remains challenged," said Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea. The retailer said it was difficult to quantify the effects of low gasoline prices and unseasonably warm weather, but those factors contributed to overall sales growth. Online sales growth accelerated sequentially for the first time in more than five quarters, rising 11.8 percent from 7 percent in the first quarter. Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said e-commerce growth was stronger in the United States than in major overseas markets, mainly because of its larger third-party seller business and the continued roll-out of online grocery pickup options. Wal-Mart has added 7 million items to its website this year, bringing the total to 15 million. This compares with 200 million on online rival Amazon.com Inc . The company raised its fiscal-year earnings outlook to between $4.15 and $4.35 a share, including an estimated hit of 5 cents from the Jet.com acquisition, from a previous range of $4 to $4.30. Second-quarter earnings per share of $1.07, excluding a gain from the sale of Wal-Mart's e-commerce business in China and other items, exceeded the analysts' average estimate by 5 cents. Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.6 percent, excluding fuel prices, to beat expectations in their eighth straight quarter of growth. International sales fell 6.6 percent to $28.6 billion but increased 2.2 percent on a currency-neutral basis. Total revenue rose 0.5 percent to $120.9 billion. Wal-Mart's shares rose as much as 2.8 percent earlier in the trading day. They were up 1.8 percent at $74.23 in afternoon trade.

By CNBC on Publish Date August 5, 2016. Photo by CNBC. Watch in Times Video » embed Hampton Creek, a prominent start-up that is trying to bring tech industry panache to the world of mayonnaise, ranch dressing and other food products, has come under scrutiny by regulators for its business practices. The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened a preliminary inquiry into Hampton Creek, according to a person briefed on the situation who asked not to be named because it had not been announced publicly. The S.E.C. inquiry is a response to a recent report from Bloomberg News that described an organized effort by Hampton Creek to buy large quantities of its Just Mayo product — a mayonnaise that uses a plant-based ingredient instead of eggs — by sending undercover contractors into stores. Kevin J. Callahan, a spokesman for the S.E.C., declined to comment. Bloomberg earlier reported the S.E.C. inquiry. Hampton Creek’s chief executive, Joshua Tetrick, said he had heard from the S.E.C. about the informal inquiry but declined to give further details. Bloomberg’s report said the product buyback effort, which took place in 2014, made Just Mayo seem more popular than it was, not long before Hampton Creek raised $90 million from venture capitalists and other private investors. The basic details of the program were confirmed by a former Hampton Creek employee, who asked for anonymity because of confidentiality restrictions with his onetime employer. Advertisement Continue reading the main story After the report, Mr. Tetrick wrote in a blog post that the mayonnaise shopping spree was part of a quality control program that had minimal impact on overall sales. The inquiry puts a cloud over Hampton Creek, which has described itself as the fastest-growing food company in the world. It has promised to tackle the food industry with the gusto of a technology start-up, using some of the same big data tools to do so. One of its goals is to identify healthy, plant-based ingredients that can substitute for common foods like eggs, with less of a negative impact on the environment. Hampton Creek, based in San Francisco, has been praised by the likes of Bill Gates; received financial backing from prominent Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors like Marc Benioff and Vinod Khosla; and succeeded in getting its products widely distributed at Walmart, Costco, Whole Foods and other retailers. The inquiry may be only the start of tougher questions facing Hampton Creek. The company is believed to be losing significant amounts of money. It is raising up to $220 million from investors, according to a Delaware filing provided by Equidate, which tracks private company shares. It’s not uncommon, of course, for start-ups to bleed red ink in their early days. But Hampton Creek, founded in 2011, faces some basic challenges with the manufacturing costs for its products. According to one former employee, in 2014 the company had negative gross margins of about 20 percent on Just Mayo, meaning that the raw cost to the company for every $1 it got in sales was about $1.20. Photo Just Mayo products use a plant-based ingredient instead of eggs. Joshua Tetrick, the company’s chief executive, said Just Mayo planned to break even by the end of next year. The issue arises from Hampton Creek’s use of premium ingredients in its products without charging shoppers the often eye-popping prices attached to such food products. The vegetable oil used in Just Mayo, for example, does not come from genetically modified organism sources, which adds significant cost, according to the former employee. Journalism that matters. More essential than ever. Subscribe to the Times But on Walmart.com on Friday, a 30-ounce jar of Just Mayo was selling for $3.66 — 32 cents less than a jar of Hellmann’s mayonnaise of the same size. In an interview on Friday, Mr. Tetrick said the company planned to break even by the end of next year. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “We are fortunate to be well capitalized,” he said, declining to disclose how much the company had in the bank. He added that some of Hampton Creek’s dressings, mayonnaise and food service cookie products were gross-margin-positive, meaning they generated more revenue than they cost to make. “We’re not trying to optimize at every turn, thinking, ‘What’s the margin?’” he said. “It’s about solving the bigger food problem. You know what we do about it? We attack it.” The company’s program to buy its own mayonnaise has raised eyebrows among retail analysts. Food makers typically do quality checks through every step of production until the product lands on grocery shelves. Kurt Jetta, chief executive of TABS Analytics, a research firm, said that while he had heard of companies buying their own products off retail shelves, in most of those cases, “it’s to jack up the sales numbers, not for quality assurance.” He also said paying retail prices to buy products for quality assurance made “zero financial sense.” When food companies want to move a product off a grocery shelf to replace it with a reformulated or newly packaged version or because it has passed its expiration date, they issue a credit to the store manager — and then only to cover the price the retailer paid, not the consumer price. Some food industry consultants, though, said it was not unheard-of for companies to buy their food products off shelves. Stericycle is a company that helps manufacturers with “audits” of their products for quality assurance purposes. “Manufacturers and retailers may need help with on-site resolution, including handling consumer complaints, product quality evaluation and much more, but they may not have the internal staff to handle those things quickly and efficiently,” said Kevin Pollack, vice president and general manager at Stericycle. Word of the program was mentioned briefly in a lawsuit against Hampton Creek filed this year on behalf of two former contractors for the company who were seeking unpaid wages. The contractors worked in stores in 2014 and 2015, representing Hampton Creek and handing out samples of Just Mayo to spread word of the product. But according to the lawsuit, Hampton Creek required the contractors to also “buy out shelves of Defendant’s products.” Stephanie Strom contributed reporting.

CDT August 19, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Pasquale Brocco’s 300-pound weight loss started with a decision to walk to the grocery store. Three years ago, Brocco realized at 605 pounds, his weight could kill him. He said in an Instagram post his eating habits were suicidal. Brocco told ABC News he made a choice to walk to Walmart every time he was hungry. “You walk to Walmart three times a day, and you end up walking 6 miles,” he told ABC News. “It’s amazing because I never walked 6 miles in my life, and I was doing it every day.” As he shed weight and felt comfortable enough to go to a gym, he added more exercise to his routine. Now, he's a gym rat with defined muscles known by friends and fans as Possible Pat. He's documented his weight loss journey on Instagram. Recently, he had surgery to remove "several feet" of excess skin, Fox 10 reports, and said he starting yet another chapter of his journey. Below are Brocco's pre- and post-weight-loss diets for a typical day: Before weight loss (about 11,200 calories per day): Box of cereal 1/2 gallon whole milk 1 package peanut butter cups 1 candy bar 12-inch meatball and cheese submarine sandwich 100 fast food chicken nuggets 1 fast food apple pie 1 fast food milkshake 2 liters soda 4 doughnuts   After weight loss (about 2,250 calories per day):   2 gallons water About 20 egg whites 1 cup oatmeal 24 ounces chicken breast Green beans 6 ounces ground lean bison 32 almonds 1/2 sweet potato   CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Off-duty deputy kills Raising Cane's robbery suspect Freeport PD looking for person of interest in baby's death Suspect dead after chase, shootout Parents look for son's road rage killer Accused cop killer got married during manhunt Wednesday morning forecast - 6:38 a.m. update Father killed by hit-and-run driver Woman in wheelchair shocked with Taser Officials: Driver was speeding before deadly Tenn. school bus crash Driver charged in deadly Tenn. school bus crash More Stories David Temple granted new trial in pregnant wife's murder Nov 23, 2016, 10:40 a.m. Police searching for mom's boyfriend after baby's death Nov 23, 2016, 4:46 a.m. Deputy kills Raising Cane's robbery suspect; 2… Nov 22, 2016, 11:41 p.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home Weather Health Detail Closings & Delays Location Search Radars Conditions Hurricane Central More...

(WMT) Pops on REAL Progress The world's biggest retailer may finally be out of the woods By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Aug 18, 2016, 8:55 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: 10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in 2017 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is Due for Even BIGGER Gains 5 Retail Stocks That May Not Be Around Next Christmas Recent Posts: Eli Lilly and Co (LLY) Drug Failure Doesn’t Answer the Bigger Question The Dow Jones Is Completely Defying Expectations Why Medtronic PLC (MDT), Dycom Industries, Inc. (DY) and Palo Alto Networks Inc (PANW) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks View All Posts Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) still has some tough challenges ahead. But Thursday’s early-morning surge in Walmart stock following a solid second-quarter earnings report says something telling and inspiring: Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr The market finally sees more reward than risk in owning a piece of WMT. Last quarter, the world’s largest retailer earned an operating profit of $1.07 per share on sales of $120.9 billion. Factoring in adverse currency exchange rates, revenue would have grown 2.8% to $123.6 billion. Analysts collectively expected WMT to earn $1.02 per share on sales of $120.34 billion, so that’s a beat on both ends. Walmart stock holders also had to be encouraged by the comparisons. Namely, Walmart earned $1.08 per share on $120.23 billion in sales. So Q2 marked the eighth straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. Same-store sales were expected to rise 1% — by analysts as well as the company — matching the first quarter’s comps growth rate. WMT pleasantly surprised on that measure too, however, logging same-store sales growth of 1.6%. All told, it marks a lot of progress on an effort that had yet to bear much fruit. Walmart’s Overhaul Effort Walmart stock began facing a brisk headwind in 2013 (fiscal 2014), forcing the company to make changes on multiple fronts. 7 Best Dividend Stocks You Haven’t Heard Of One of the retailer’s bigger sore spots has been its e-commerce division. It has been losing ground to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), partially because Amazon is good, and partially because Walmart didn’t allocate enough resources to its digital sales venue. That changed late last year. WMT announced it would spend an additional $2 billion on its e-commerce platform over the course of 2016 and 2017. More fulfillment centers and online grocery shopping were among the focal points. It didn’t help much initially. Walmart’s e-commerce growth rate continued every quarter since the first quarter of 2015, falling to only 7% for the first quarter. Last quarter, though, digital sales grew 11.3%. Gross merchandise volume was up 13% compared to Q2 of a year earlier. It was progress at a time investors needed to see it. The recent $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com could provide another much-needed jolt to Walmart’s e-commerce engine. The deal, however, has raised more questions than it has answered, most of them focusing on any integration and associated timelines. All the same, most observers are enthusiastic about the deal’s potential. Nomura analyst Jessica Schoen Mace commented, “We believe the broadline retailers have higher vulnerability to online competition, but view Walmart’s acquisition of Jet.com as a positive development in the company’s e-commerce strategy.” Walmart has also upped its payroll spending. After years of labor-related headaches (mostly a lack of pay), Walmart acquiesced. In April of last year, 500,000 employees saw their hourly pay ramp up to $9, then 1 million workers got a bump up to $10 per hour in February of this year. Though arguably necessary, owners of Walmart stock have seen those pay raises take a toll on the bottom line. Last year, CFO Brett Biggs warned investors the initiative could shave $1.5 billion off this year’s bottom line, and so far, the number doesn’t seem implausible. During the first quarter, selling and administrative expenses grew by $1.4 billion, or 6.3%, though revenue was only up 1%. For Q2, selling and administrative costs were up 4.6%, to $25.2 billion. Not Everything Is Hunky-Dory, Though Walmart has continued to struggle at finding a winning mix of formats and product focuses.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 45.13 or 0.24% to 18,552.57, while the S&P 500 Composite index inched down by 3.15 or 0.14% to 2,183.87, both falling short of a positive close in spite of a late rally. At session-lows, the Dow fell as much as 100 points. On the S&P 500, six of 10 sectors closed in the red as stocks in defensive Utilities and Telecommunications industries lagged. Stocks in the Technology, Industrials and Basic Materials sectors led, each gaining more than 0.10% on the session. The NASDAQ Composite index, meanwhile, fell 1.77 or 0.03% to 5,238.38, amid declines in media and telecom stocks. Despite the slight losses, the NASDAQ completed its first 8-week winning streak since 2010. Shares in Viacom B Inc (NASDAQ:VIAB) surged more than 1.5% to an intraday high of 44.16, amid reports of an impending settlement between chairman emeritus Sumner Redstone and CEO Philippe Dauman. As part of the settlement, Dauman could reportedly receive a severance package of as much $72 million, according to CNBC and other media reports. In addition, the two sides will end a protracted legal dispute and Dauman will reportedly be replaced by Tom Dooley as interim CEO through September. The top performer on the Dow was Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE), which jumped 1.69 or 2.95% to 58.90. It came after the multinational athletic apparel giant agreed to form a supply-chain partnership with private equity firm Apollo Global Management. As part of the deal, the partnership agreed to acquire Pennsylvania-based apparel company New Holland, which maintains factories in two Central American countries. The worst performer was Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), which fell 1.49 or 2.01% to 72.81, amid heavy profit taking. On Thursday, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) hit 1-year highs at 74.29 after achieving comparable store sales growth of 1.6% in the second quarter, representing its strongest quarterly gains in three years. The biggest gainer on the NASDAQ was Applied Materials Inc (NASDAQ:AMAT), which surged 1.49 or 2.01% to 72.81. Shares in the Santa Clara, California-based semiconductor chip maker extended gains from Thursday's after-hours session after the company topped quarterly earnings forecasts amid a fresh record-high in new orders on the period. The worst performer was DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH), which fell 1.13 or 2.19% to 50.40. The top performer on the S&P 500 was Deere & Company (NYSE:DE), which surged 10.38 or 13.849% to 87.32. John Deere shares popped in spite of soft earnings over its third quarter, due primarily to continued weakness in the global agricultural economy. Earlier this week, billionaire investors Warren Buffett and Bill Gates reduced their stakes in the farm equipment manufacturer ahead of the earnings release. Investors, however, focused more intently on the company's forward guidance, as Deere increased its full-year earnings outlook from $1.2 to $1.35 billion. The worst performer was DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc (NYSE:DVA), which fell 3.17 or 4.69% to 50.42. On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by a 1,759-1,191 margin. Investing.com offers an extensive set of professional tools for the financial markets.

But, this grocery chain that specializes in organic fare is also known as a pricey place to shop for food. And for parents trying to raise a family and grow their wealth at the same time, groceries can take a huge bite out of their budgets. If you’re looking to save money on food, you probably don't want to do all of your shopping at Whole Foods. However, the company has made recent moves to make shopping at the upscale grocer more affordable. For example, earlier this year, Whole Foods began opening 365 by Whole Foods Market stores, which were "designed around affordability and convenience," said co-founder John Mackey in a press release. "Through lower capital and operating costs, we are able to offer great values to our customers, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive." To help you figure out what to buy and skip at this grocer, GOBankingRates.com talked to consumer and money-saving experts. Click through to see their best and worst deals so you can save money on your next trip to Whole Foods. 10 Best Deals at Whole Foods You can find several items at Whole Foods that cost the same or less than at other grocery stores. Be sure, though, to check WholeFoods.com for coupons. You might also find Whole Foods coupons by searching coupon sites. Teri Gault, grocery-shopping expert and author of “Shop Smart. Save More,” recommended signing up for email notifications from discount gift card site Raise.com so you’ll know when discounted Whole Foods gift cards are available and can buy them to use in the store. Here are 10 products, in particular, that are typically good deals at Whole Foods. 1. Olive Oil Gina Briles, who has researched Whole Foods’ prices versus those at other grocers for Cheapism.com, said one of the best deals at Whole Foods is its 365 brand organic olive oil, which is priced lower than name brands and other supermarkets’ own organic brands. According to Briles, a 33.8-ounce bottle of non-organic 365 Everyday Value olive oil was about $4 less than the same size jar from Safeway Signature Select — one of the best generic brands for saving money. 2. Balsamic Vinegar The 365 Everyday Value organic balsamic vinegar is a great deal, said Gault. It costs about 25 percent less than Newman's Own organic balsamic vinegar sold in supermarkets, and it's richer and thicker, claimed Gault, who considers herself to be a balsamic aficionado.

Organic Milk A gallon of Whole Foods 365 Everyday Value organic milk cost 50 cents less than organic milk found at Safeway, found GOBankingRates. If you buy organic milk primarily to avoid the growth hormone given to cows, you can save even more by buying conventional milk that has an "rBST free" seal on the label, said Gault. 4. Non-Dairy Milk For those who can’t consume dairy or choose not to, Whole Foods has competitive pricing on its store-brand milk alternatives. According to research by Cheapism.com, 365 Everyday Value organic almond milk and soy milk is 60 cents to 70 cents less than some brands found at Safeway. When these and other non-dairy milks go on sale at Whole Foods, you can stock up and save as much as 50 percent per ounce as compared to the refrigerated 64-ounce varieties, said Gault. 5. Organic Chicken Broth A 32-ounce carton of 365 Everyday Value organic chicken broth at Whole Foods is priced 30 cents less than Safeway’s O Organics broth, according to Cheapism. GOBankingRates also found that it was 30 cents cheaper than the organic broth at Walmart. 6. Peanut Butter Whole Foods’ natural peanut butter is cheaper than similar peanut butter sold at grocery stores, said Kyle James, founder of coupon and deal site Rather-Be-Shopping.com. “If you buy a case, ask about a 15 percent quantity discount,” he said. Cheapism also found that a 16-ounce jar of Whole Foods’ almond butter costs $6.99, which is cheaper per ounce than Kroger’s Simple Truth 12-ounce jar of almond butter and the Maranatha brand at Walmart. 7. Vegetarian or Vegan Sausage If you love sausage but not meat, you can get a good deal on the vegetarian variety at Whole Foods. “In particular, check out the Tofurky vegan sausage links at Whole Foods, as they’re typically priced 30 percent to 40 percent cheaper than at your local grocery store,” said James. 8. Organic Coconut Oil If you like to use coconut oil for cooking or skin or hair care, you’ll probably get a good deal on the Whole Foods 365 brand. According to Cheapism.com, a 14-ounce jar is $1 less than Safeway’s O Organics coconut oil. And GOBankingRates found that the 365-brand jar was $1.50 less than Spectrum Coconut Oil at Safeway. Find Out: How to Stop Paying for Stuff 9. Organic Canned Beans “If you regularly stock up on canned organic black beans, you should only be buying them from Whole Foods,” said James. In particular, the 365 brand is a great deal, he added. 10. Organic Maple Syrup Whole Foods’ 365 Everyday Value organic maple syrup is about 40 cents less per ounce than Safeway’s O Organics syrup, according to Cheapism.com. And GOBankingRates found that the 365 brand price per ounce beat smaller bottles of syrup at Kroger and Walmart by more than 10 cents. 10 Deals to Skip at Whole Foods Although you can find many deals at Whole Foods, some items are priced much higher than similar products at other supermarkets. In 2015, Business Insider compared 31 items at Whole Foods and Kroger, and found the bill was $60 higher at Whole Foods. If you want to avoid overspending at Whole Foods, don't buy these 10 items in particular. 1. Beef Although Whole Foods does have sales on meat, its prices rarely go as low as supermarket sale prices, said Gault. And, Whole Foods’ “regular prices are most always higher than supermarkets’ regular prices on any meat, whether organic or not,” she added. 2. Organic Chicken Whole organic chickens usually cost around $4 per pound at Whole Foods, while the average price at supermarkets is $3.50 per pound, Gault said. 3. Cereal Instead of shopping at Whole Foods for cereal, you might want to check out other supermarkets and retailers for lower prices. "Name-brand cereals, crackers, cookies and other packaged items will frequently be less expensive at supermarkets or discount stores that carry the same brands (Walmart, Target)," said Stephanie Nelson of The Coupon Mom. 4. Gluten-Free Items Whole Foods carries a lot of gluten-free items, but they’re not as affordable as offerings at Sprouts or Target, said Gault. “Expect to pay 10 percent to 30 percent more for gluten-free at Whole Foods,” she said. For example, Whole Foods carries Nature's Path buckwheat gluten-free waffles, as does Target. At Target, they cost about $2.99, said Gault. But, they can cost more than $3 at Whole Foods, depending on where you shop. 5. Roasted Chicken Whole Foods’ deli offerings are beautiful — but marked up, said Gault. For example, whole non-organic roasted chickens are regularly priced at around $9 at Whole Foods. However, the regular price for roasted chickens at supermarkets averages $5 to $7, she said. 6. Fish Whole Foods states on its website that its seafood department sources from "responsibly managed fish farms and fisheries." Perhaps that explains, in part, the higher price of its fish. For example, the regular price of wild swordfish steak at Whole Foods is $13.99 per pound — $11.99 on sale, said Gault. However, the average regular price is $11.99 per pound at supermarkets, with sale prices averaging $6.97 per pound, she said. 7. Frozen Foods Many convenient frozen foods cost more at Whole Foods, said Gault. For example, Van's frozen waffles are regularly priced around $3.79 at Whole Foods, while the regular price at Target and Sprouts is $2.99, she said. 8. Produce The regular price of organic and conventional produce is generally higher at Whole Foods than supermarkets, said Gault. In fact, in-season organic produce is usually a featured sale item in supermarkets. For example, toward the end of the summer, when grapes are in season, supermarkets typically sell the non-organic variety for 77 cents to 99 cents per pound, she said. 9. Specialty Cheeses Don’t expect to find deals on artisan and imported cheeses at Whole Foods. You’ll likely find much better deals at warehouse clubs, such as Costco. There’s less variety at warehouse clubs — and you have to buy a larger quantity — but specialty cheese prices will typically beat prices at Whole Foods and other grocers, said Gault. “Expect to pay half as much for the same or comparable specialty cheese at club stores,” she said. 10. Eggs Whole Foods should not be your go-to place for eggs if you’re looking for a deal. Business Insider found eggs are almost $1 less per dozen at Trader Joe’s than at Whole Foods.

SCOUT Troy Wayrynen/USA TODAY Sports Mike Zimmer should have just been honest in his decision to sit Teddy Bridgewater John Holler 08/20/2016 Minnesota Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer got combative with the media when asked about sitting out a healthy Teddy Bridgewater Thursday night -- a move that caught many by surprise. A night later, a coaching mate of Zimmer's did the exact same thing, but a simple explanation stopped any conspiracy theorists in their tracks. Marvin Lewis lost his immediate football family in early 2014. Despite being under fire from the local media types in southern Ohio for not being able to win a playoff game after making the playoffs, the rest of the NFL was taking notice. Among them being Zygi Wilf and Daniel Snyder – two guys you’ll never see in the school supplies isle at Target or Walmart. They figured Marv’s Queen City malaise was his problem. They were eyeballing his underlings – defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer and offensive coordinator Jay Gruden, who would become the head coaches of the Minnesota Vikings and Washington Redskins, respectively. Despite losing both his coordinators in one fell swoop, Lewis made the playoffs in 2015, so it was all good. So did Zimmer. So did Gruden. All hail the coaching tree. On Thursday night, in what turned out to be one of the more controversial moves (by his design) of his coaching tenure, Zimmer made the decision to inform Teddy Bridgewater he didn’t need to showcase his talents in front of the 12th Man. Sorry, Seattle, you paid to see Shaun Hill leave the game with a lead. Deal with it. http://www.scout.com/nfl/vikings/story/1697623-vikings-defenders-get-aft... On Friday night, in a bold rejoinder, Gruden shockingly told small sample-size starting QB Kirk Cousins to have a seat and watch the proceedings in front of the 53,000-and-change paying customers at home. Well played, sir. Tip your king, Zim. This particular chess game is over. Both coaches made the identical decision, but Gruden showed how the move is done properly. Zimmer did it in such a way that it seemed almost like he was picking for a fight when asked for an explanation. It was inevitable that Zimmer was going to be asked why, to the shock of just about everyone outside Winter Park, Bridgewater wasn’t going to play. Is Teddy hurt? Not according to comments after the game. There he was on the sideline. He looks fine. So why isn’t he playing? It was a question everyone watching the Shaun Hill Era begin was asking. It wasn’t so much asking why? It was more a “wait…what?” situation. The local Vikings-centric TV broadcast hinted that explanations would be forthcoming. It wasn’t. Zimmer went full-on salty when his decision was questioned. It had all the makings of a general being asked by someone with the audacity to question a decision made beyond the comprehension of those who couldn’t possibly fathom the bigger picture of his battle plan. In the world Zimmer grew up in, if a head coach dressed down a reporter to the point of asking if the questioner if he or she was “alright” with his decision, that would have been that. The next time it happened, the coach's authority or reasoning likely wouldn't be questioned. In the world Zimmer lives in now, unless you take ownership of a decision preemptively, the instantaneous backlash fueled by social-media speculation is pronounced. Left to their own devices, media types (and millions of Vikings fans) began to question that, if Teddy was healthy, was his benching disciplinary in nature? When asked what seemed to be a relatively obvious question, Zimmer got very defensive – coming close to asking, “Do you want a piece of me?” from a fighting posture. The postgame Q & A became a battle that wasn’t necessary. Just 24 hours later, Gruden did the exact same thing – making Cousins an 11th-hour healthy scratch. Yet, when the D.C. media – known for attempting to unearth coverups and conspiracies – asked Gruden why Cousins was inexplicably scratched from the lineup, he was forthcoming. His claim was that the players fighting for depth chart positioning and roster spots deserved a longer look in game action. No conspiracy. No secret reason. He came straight out and said that, while it was his decision, there was a valid reason for it. There have been times Zimmer has been at odds with media in giving out information about his players and the reasons for the coaching decisions he has made along the way. But Thursday’s spectacle was one that easily could have been avoided (and understood) if Zimmer had simply said he wanted to give Shaun Hill a chance to show what he could do with the first-unit offense. Instead, he was combative and, by his reluctance to simply give an honest answer, put himself and the media at odds and caught Bridgewater in the middle. As it turns out, Bridgewater had a sore shoulder, according to ESPN, that wouldn't have been serious enough to hold him out of a regular season game. Even that simple explanation would have sufficed. Perhaps Gruden learned from Zimmer’s mistake and came out with a rational excuse why he would bench his starting quarterback when the expectation was that he was going to play. Even in the cloak and dagger world of the NFL, sometimes honesty remains the best policy.   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Newman doubtful; Diggs, others questionable Key matchup: Mid-rounders vs. first-rounders Zimmer praises Lions … for now Three-and-out: NFL Thanksgiving matchups Rhodes named NFC defensive player of week Viking Update Top Stories Key matchup: Mid-rounders vs. first-rounders The Minnesota Vikings have gotten a lot of production out of their mid-round defensive ends, but they will be facing a couple of first-round offensive tackles. by John Holler Viking Update10:36 AM Newman doubtful; Diggs, others questionableThe Minnesota Vikings aren’t likely to field their normal starting lineup on Thanksgiving with a short week of recovery. by Tim Yotter Viking Update10:23 AM Rhodes named NFC defensive player of weekXavier Rhodes’ first two-interception game of his career propelled him into the NFC defensive player of the week. by Tim Yotter Viking Update9:54 AM Hard-core stats: Vikings vs. Lions Where do the Minnesota Vikings have an advantage over the Detroit Lions?

This year, the event is even bigger. The Virginia Food Truck Battle and Beer Competition will feature food trucks from throughout the state and statewide craft beer vendors. All proceeds will benefit The MaDee Project, which helps families of children with pediatric cancer. "We are excited about this year's 'First Statewide Food Truck Battle,'" said Kim Metje, the event coordinator. "We are ready for large crowds this year. Last year, being our first year we were praying for 1,000 to come and 2,800 showed up. A good problem that we have made good notes on and adjusted for 2,800 and many more." The event will feature 24 food trucks from Fairfax, Winchester, Broadway, Harrisonburg, Staunton, Augusta County, Charlottesville, Roanoke, Lynchburg and Richmond, Metje said. There will also be six breweries that each have a beer entry for the competition. THE NEWS LEADER Food Truck Battle comes back for second year To accommodate the larger crowds expected, Metje said there will be multiple zones and sections for the food trucks. "The trucks are divided in to three zones with eight trucks in each zone," she said. "Each zone will represent trucks from different locations and styles of food. The zones are spread out to accommodate the crowds, but all within easy walk to each other. "We also will have plenty of parking," Metje added. Entrance into the museum will be one way off of Richmond Road and exit onto Frontier Drive, Metje said. Parking will be available at the old Dice's parking lot and the lower half of Walmart and Lowe's. "We will have trolleys to shuttle people back and forth if parking in those areas," Metje said. "(There will be) plenty of Port-a-Johns and hand washing stations too. We took good notes last year and are ready for another wonderful well planned out event that will help so many families battling pediatric cancer."  (Photo: Submitted) How it works There will be VIP tickets and general admission, just like last year. VIP tastings start at noon.  VIP ticket holders purchase their ticket in a zone and will get a tasting of the food entry from each of the eight trucks in their zone. Each VIP ticket holder will also get a 2 ounce tasting of the six beers entered. General admission ticket-holders enter at 2 p.m.   All food trucks will begin selling food items at 2 p.m.   All ticket-holders are able to check out the museum's exhibits. Event goes to 7 p.m. "We are not listing what trucks are in each zone, but they won’t be disappointed," Metje said. "We have excellent trucks coming and they are serious about the competition. So they are bringing their A-Game." Buy Photo  (Photo: Laura Peters/The News Leader) THE NEWS LEADER Pupuseria truck owner shows why tamales can’t be rushed There will be music from Kiz Carter, the V’s, The Sundried Opossums and Glass Betty and an expanded children’s area with a balloon show and magic show and games — all free. Area craft and merchant vendors and other food trucks will be in attendance to offer things like kettle corn, gourmet popsicles, funnel cakes and slushes, Metje said. Something new this year is the VIP’s vote on favorite food truck in their zone and the zone winners will then summit their tasting to a panel of three chefs, Metje said.  The chefs will then decide on the grand champion for the entire battle. The chefs are: Ian Boden – The Shack in Staunton. Isaac Coles – Jimmy Madison in Harrisonburg Chris Jacks – Wild Wolf Brewery in Nelson County "​The food truck battle draws a large and diverse audience, many of whom have never been to the Frontier Culture Museum," said Joe Herget, marketing director at the Frontier Culture Museum. "So this event creates a fantastic opportunity for us to attract a lot of first-time visitors, show them the museum, and encourage them to become regular visitors. All food truck battle tickets allow access to the entire museum, so people are free to explore the exhibits throughout the day." Buy Photo  (Photo: Laura Peters/The News Leader) The battle is set for Sept. 4, during Labor Day weekend. VIP tickets are $35 in advance and $40 at the door. General Admission is $10 in advance and $15 at the door. Tickets are available at VaFoodTruckBattle.com. Last year, first place went to Staunton's own Farm Fresh Fixins, with the runner-up going to Gaby's Delicias. With the amount of people who came last year, Metje said the money raised for The MaDee Project was able to go further. "We are expecting people from all over the state to attend this year," Metje said. "With a three-day weekend many are coming in on Saturday and Sunday to visit and attend the battle." Herget said the museum is ready for the crowds, but does advise visitors to come early — 11 a.m. for VIP ticket holders and 1:30 p.m. for general admission. "The museum staff has extensive experience hosting large events, and with about 175 working acres of land, the museum can handle large crowds — when we know they're coming," he said.

Published on Sunday, August 21, 2016 by Common Dreams Do Unions Belong in the Fight Against Corporate School Reform? by Steven Singer 0 Comments Unions "are essential to the health of public education," writes Steven Singer. (Photo: Gadfly on the Wall Blog) In the fight for public education, the forces of standardization and privatization are running scared. They’ve faced more pushback in the last few years – especially in the last few months – than in a decade. The Opt Out movement increases exponentially every year. Teach for America is having trouble getting recruits. Pearson’s stock is plummeting. The NAACP and Black Lives Matter have both come out strongly against increasing charter schools. They want you to believe that the corporate vultures preying on our public schools are really just misunderstood philanthropists.  So what’s a corporate education reformer to do? Answer: Change the narrative. They can’t control the facts, so instead they try to control the story being told about the facts. It’s a classic propaganda technique. As Malcolm X put it: “If you’re not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.” Their story goes like this – yes, there is a battle going on over public education. But the two sides fighting aren’t who you think they are. The fight for public schools isn’t between grassroots communities and well-funded AstroTurf organizations, they say. Despite the evidence of your eyes, the fight isn’t between charter school sycophants and standardized test companies, on the one hand, and parents, students and teachers on the other. No. It’s actually between people who really care about children and those nasty, yucky unions. It’s nonsense, of course. Pure spin.  They want you to believe that the corporate vultures preying on our public schools are really just misunderstood philanthropists. And those demanding a fair shake for their own children and communities are really just paid shills from a monolithic and uncaring bureaucracy. In essence, they want you to believe two things: 1) Despite profiting off the system and zero evidence supporting the efficacy of corporate school policies, they’re motivated purely by empathy. 2) Unions are evil by definition and they pervert everything they touch. Put simply, unions are not perfect, but they are not evil. In fact, they are essential to the health of public education. I’m not going to bother with the first claim here. There is an inherent bias from those who wish to change the laws so they can more easily profit off of schools without actually helping students learn and in fact exist at the expense of that learning. If you can’t see through the propaganda wing of the Walmart corporation, the Broad Foundation and Big Daddy Bill Gates, you probably won’t be very receptive to anything else I have to say. Instead I will focus on the second claim, because it is the more pernicious of the two. Put simply, unions are not perfect, but they are not evil. In fact, they are essential to the health of public education. Many progressives are upset with teachers unions because of the current Presidential election. Both the National Education Association (NEA) and theAmerican Federation of Teachers (AFT) endorsed Hillary Clinton in the primary election without what many would consider adequately polling rank and file members. For better or worse, the endorsements were top-down affairs reflecting the preference of union leaders. That’s not how unions are supposed to work. And it’s having consequences for the way both members and non-members view teachers unions. Critics infer from this that unions don’t represent membership. They are de factoarms of the waiting Clinton administration and the neoliberal agenda. There may be some truth to this, but it does not represent the whole picture. Not nearly.  Unions are like any other democratic organization. The larger the association, the further from the grassroots the decision making body. In the mammoth national unions, decisions are made by representatives most removed from our schools. They probably were teachers or support staff at some point in the past, but that may be ancient history. Now they are professional leaders and therefore at a remove from the grassroots. By contrast, in our local chapters, leaders are most often working classroom teachers. Decisions are made by those still meeting students’ needs on a day-to-day basis. As such, they retain an authenticity and expertise that may be more cloudy in the large bureaucracies. This isn’t to say the national unions are by definition unconcerned with the needs of teachers and students. I’m sure that most of the NEA and AFT leadership who decided to endorse Clinton did it because they honestly believe doing so will help public education. And – who knows – they may be right. But what they forgot in this case was the democratic process they were tasked with preserving. As such, they may have to pay a price for their hubris when their terms are up. In most cases, the leaders of national teachers unions are at too much of a remove to see what is best for our schools. And they usually know that. It is up to the rank and file to tell them what to do, and that’s what happens every year at representative assemblies through various caucuses made up of work-a-day members. And if leaders overstep their authority it is members’ duty to hold them accountable at election time.  So even though the national organizations are most likely to go astray, they often don’t. Usually even these giants are trying to improve the situation in our public schools. Opposition to privatization and standardization policies doesn’t come from the leadership of the NEA and AFT. It comes from the grassroots. However, it can’t be denied that the most intense and passionate activism happens a bit closer to where the rubber hits the road. It’s those local chapters that are there everyday and make the most difference. They are the heart and soul of unionism.  So when corporate education reformers sneeringly deprecate their opponents as mere unions, they’re glossing over an important distinction. Opposition to privatization and standardization policies doesn’t come from the leadership of the NEA and AFT. It comes from the grassroots. This is not a top down initiative. It is bottom up. This is how it’s always been. There is no political organization directing the fight to save public education. The Democrats certainly aren’t overly concerned with reigning in charter schools. It was grassroots Democrats – some of whom are also union members – who worked to rewrite the party platform to do so. The Clinton campaign is not directing anyone to opt out of standardized testing. However, voters are demanding that Clinton be receptive to their needs – and some of them are union members. There is no great union conspiracy to fight these policies. It’s called public opinion, and it’s changing. That’s what scares the standardizers and privatizers. They’ve had free run of the store for almost two decades and now the public is waking up. They’re desperately trying to paint this as a union movement when it’s not. Unions are involved, but they aren’t alone. And moreover, their involvement is not necessarily an impediment. The biggest lie to have resonated with the public is this notion that teachers unions are only concerned with shielding bad teachers from justice. This is demonstrably untrue. The needs of the community and the needs of teachers are the same. Both want excellent public schools. Both want the best for our students. Both want academic policies that will help students learn – not help corporations cash in. And both groups want good teachers in the classroom – not bad ones! The biggest lie to have resonated with the public is this notion that teachers unions are only concerned with shielding bad teachers from justice. This is demonstrably untrue. Unions fight to make sure teachers get due process, but they also fight to make sure bad teachers are shown the door. In fact, in districts with strong unions, MORE bad teachers are fired – not less, according to a new study by economics Prof. Eunice Han from the University of Utah. The study entitled The Myth of Unions’ Overprotection of Bad Teachers concludes that when unions are strong and successfully bargain for higher salaries, they have an incentive to help ensure ineffective teachers don’t receive tenure. In short, it costs too much to keep bad teachers on staff. It is in the interests of the collective bargaining unit to ensure those unfit to teach move along. Moreover, Han also concludes that strong unions actually help reduce the dropout rate. It just makes sense. When you treat people like the professionals they are, when you give them autonomy and respect, they’re free to concentrate more energy into their jobs than fighting to keep those jobs. But unions stand in direct opposition to the efforts of corporate vultures trying to swoop in and profit off of public education. Teachers provide a valuable service to students. If your goal is to reduce the cost of that service no matter how much that reduces its value to students, you need a weak labor force. You need the ability to reduce salary so you can claim the savings as profit.  THAT’S why corporate education reformers hate teachers and their unions. We make it nearly impossible to swipe school budgets into their own pockets. So do unions belong in the fight against corporate education reform? Answer: Heck yeah! In fact, they are essential to it.

By Dennis Seid Daily Journal TUPELO – Being in the shadow of drugstore giant Walgreens is a challenge Tupelo Drugs welcomes. The independent pharmacy opened in June on Garfield Drive in what was originally Super Sav-On-Drugs. “I think it’s just more personable being an independent and not part of a chain,” said Tupelo Drugs pharmacist Amy Cochran. “You’re not just a number. You get to actually know customers, you spend time with them, you know them by name and you’re not just pushing through things.” According to the National Community Pharmacists Association, the U.S. has some 22,000 independent pharmacies, representing an $81.4 billion market and employing 314,000 people. Walgreens, the nation’s largest drugstore chain, has some 8,200 stores alone, generating nearly $50 billion in sales. CVS has nearly 8,000 stores with just under $49 billion in sales. Competition is everywhere – big-box retailers like Wal-Mart also have pharmacies, as do discounters like Fred’s and supermarket chains like Kroger. Independents focus on their service and convenience to separate themselves from the pack. “It’s tough sometimes,” Cochran said. “The bigger chains can sell something and not make as much money, so they can sell other things like dog food, drinks, or something else in the store. “But we focus on healthcare and service …the other things take away from that.” Ironically, Walgreens operated from the Tupelo Drugs building before it opened its store next door in 2009. One of the owners of Tupelo Drugs is Scott Baker, whose father, J.K. Baker, owned Super Sav-On-Drugs. Everything has come full circle it seems. Cochran worked for the Bakers in their stores for 18 years, and is a familiar face with customers. Thomas Wells | Buy at photos.djournal.com upelo Drugs pharmacy technician Shelly Washington hands a prescription to a customer at the drive-through window. The pharmacy is located on Garfield Drive, across from the North Mississippi Medical Center. So, too, is Shelly Washington, a pharmacy technician who worked at the former Super Sav-On-Drugs location for 12 years. While the big chain pharmacies tout their $4 prescription drug lists and other supposed price advantages, independents are competitive with their pricing as well.” For example, Tupelo Drugs also has a $4 prescription list. Co-pays are the same as any other local competitors’ co-pays, and it also matches prices. Cochran began working with Super-Sav-On in 1988 after she graduated from the University of Mississippi, first in Tupelo, then in Okolona. Super Sav-On was later sold and she began working with a national retailer. “It’s a lot different working with an independent,” she said. “You get to know everyone and you become a big family. A lot of people are glad we’re here, because they don’t have to wait in line for 30 minutes or go home and come back for their medicine. Tupelo Drugs is conveniently located across from North Mississippi Medical Center, and its drive-through has been a popular option “We have a store in Winfield, Alabama, and we fill over 300 prescriptions a day, and no one waits more than five minutes,” said Heather Smith, the office manager for the company. That’s the goal Tupelo Drugs is aiming for as well. “We want to make those connections with everybody who comes here,” Cochran said. “We’ll take the time to call the doctor and get your refills, and if you can’t afford the prescription or don’t have the insurance, we’ll call to see if we can do something. We’re going to do everything we can to take care of you.” The pharmacy is open 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday. Click here to leave a comment!

Long Island, New York (PRWEB) August 21, 2016 The Holiday Inn Westbury – Long Island is actively seeking to provide an airline with crew accommodations on a long term basis that fly in and out of JFK Airport, and their goal is to have a working relationship with one or several by late 2016 or early 2017. The Holiday Inn Westbury – Long Island has been host to several airlines over the last decade, and at one time has accommodated as many as three different airlines during the same time period. Some may wonder why a Long Island hotel located in the middle of Nassau County would seek to host an airline, or perhaps why an airline typically flying in and out of John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) would seek a hotel in Nassau County, Long Island; however, it's more common than one may think. For the most part, it has a lot to do with location, as cockpit and cabin crew members of airlines have down time between flights, especially those flying International flights, and for the most part, the last thing they want is to stay right by an airport. Noise levels are typically one of the main concerns and factors, as the crew members need to get their rest, but other factors include being able to venture out and see and explore various points of interest, which is also just very relaxing and enjoyable to many crews. In the case of the Holiday Inn Westbury, it happens to be located next to three large shopping malls, and is within walking distance to some of the more popular and large chain stores such as Walmart and Target. It's also in walking distance to the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), which makes it extremely convenient for crew members to venture into Manhattan. The reason a hotel often seeks to host an airline crew is because it provides a hotel with long-term and secured revenue stream, and once a hotel becomes accustomed to the airline's schedule and arrival and departure patterns, it can set up its operations on a relatively predictable schedule. Other factors airlines often consider is whether or not a hotel is a full service property, or one of limited service. Typically airlines seek properties that can offer their crew members full amenities and services, which includes such services as a restaurant, business center, fitness room, swimming pool, outdoor areas such as courtyards, complimentary WiFi, laundry services, etc. The Holiday Inn Westbury's General Manager, Franklin Manchester stated, "There are many factors that both the hotel and the airline have to consider. About 50% of it revolves around income and expenses for all entities, but the other 50% has a lot to do with the accommodations, services and amenities a hotel property can offer, and what an airline's expectations are, which often includes an airline's executive officers, and specific members of their crew. I believe that any airline that is seeking accommodations away from an airport property should consider the Holiday Inn Westbury, as I know we have the amenities and services crews are seeking, and I honestly believe we are in the best location that one can be in, based upon my knowledge of the things they enjoy doing." Manchester added that both the Hotel and the various airlines go through what he referred to as a "Getting To Know You Process." Airlines don't just pick any hotel, and the Holiday Inn Westbury does not just accept any airline crew. He said, "There has to be a chemistry between the two," and he believes that has to do with what an airline's expectations are, and what the Hotel can deliver. He said, "Airlines want to be sure that their crew members will be well cared for, and the Hotel wants to ensure that the crew members will treat the Hotel as their home away from home." He noted that the experience the Hotel's team has in hosting crew accommodations for various airlines is something that all airlines should consider and recognize, because those that have not done so before may be faced with challenges that are difficult to overcome. The Holiday Inn Westbury has 152 rooms and suites, and is seeking to host a crew or crews of 30 – 35 rooms, which would leave approximately 120 rooms for the Hotel to offer other market segments such as their corporate, leisure and social travelers that they host on an individual and group basis. Their centralized location within Nassau County, and relatively short distance from New York's JFK Airport make them an ideal property for all guests visiting the area.

(Photo: Michael Lehmkuhle/The Advocate)Buy Photo Story Highlights City plans to extend Baker Boulevard to Evans Boulevard and put a roundabout on Sharon Valley Road. A tax increment financing district, or TIF, uses property taxes from the new Kroger for road work. 212 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORE NEWARK – The North 21st Street commercial corridor attracts plenty of traffic, but also invites motorists to find alternate routes to reach their favorite stores without battling all the congestion. The future will likely bring more stores and more traffic, but also another route. The city plans to connect Baker Boulevard to Evans Boulevard, built a decade ago to reach the new Legend Elementary and Liberty Middle schools from Sharon Valley Road. And to ease traffic flow on Sharon Valley Road, a roundabout will be built next year at the Evans Boulevard-Sharon Valley Road intersection. Traffic on North 21st will likely increase when the Kroger Marketplace opens in November at the former Meijer location. Also on 21st, Popeyes is building a restaurant next to Rally's and the former Valley Lanes site is being marketed for a shopping center. And, the current Kroger on Deo Drive should be able to attract a new tenant to Indian Valley Plaza, its owner said. “Newark is a growing city at the right rate," Mayor Jeff Hall said. "We need to improve intersections and traffic flow. It’s challenging, but you want it to grow a little bit. "Traffic is not a bad thing. People are shopping and spending money. If everybody was concerned, there wouldn’t be that amount of traffic.” No matter how busy North 21st Street becomes, there is only so much that can be done to alleviate congestion, officials said. “You can’t widen the road," City Engineer Brian Morehead said. "The right of way purchase would be extravagant. The cost would be way more than construction. We’re trying to coordinate all signals and trying to eliminate as many driveway approaches as we can. There's not a lot we can do. It’s congested, but it’s our commercial area.” Traffic on North 21st moved at about 45 miles an hour 20 years ago, Morehead said, but now travels at about the posted speed limit of 35 miles per hour. Residents in north and west Newark prefer traveling Sharon Valley Road to King Road to Goosepond Road to reach Wal-Mart on North 21st or Kroger on Deo Drive. Park Shai, who manages real estate for Kroger building owner James Van Winkle, said the Deo Drive location should be attractive to a new tenant, if and when the building is vacant. “Kroger hasn’t announced they’re leaving yet and they still have a current lease,” Shai said. Obviously, we’d market it to get a new tenant in there.” Baker Boulevard extension In a few years, an even more direct route will be available when Evans and Baker boulevards are connected. A tax increment financing district, or TIF, will be established to use property taxes from the Kroger development to help pay for infrastructure improvements in the area. It will take a few years, the mayor said, to accumulate enough TIF funds to make the road improvements. “We’re at the very early stages,” Hall said. “We think there’s a need. I think everybody agrees with that. It’s a concept we think is right.” Many years ago, city officials considered extending Baker Boulevard all the way to King Road, and into Newark Township. That’s not the current plan, Morehead said, although no design work has yet been done. “We’ll try to get the TIF in place and move forward with design after that,” Morehead said. “I don’t think it’s necessary to go all the way to King. That could come at a later time. It wouldn’t be cheap.” The cost of extending Baker to Evans would cost about $4 million, Morehead said. It would add another $2 million to reach King Road, he said. Keith Loughlin, executive director of Newark Area Soccer Association, said soccer fans will be elated when the Baker Boulevard extension is built and they can enter and exit without ever driving on North 21st. The 65-acre NASA complex is located at the end of Baker Boulevard and within sight of the schools on Sharon Valley Road. “The North 21st Street corridor is very busy and in some ways very dangerous," Loughlin said. "We’re told people choose not to come to NASA because of North 21st Street.” NASA has grown in popularity and in size. There is room for a dozen full-size fields, or up to 30 fields of various sizes to accommodate players of various ages, Loughlin said. Parking has been expanded for up to 400 cars. The facility averages about 500 to 800 people per night. The annual Buckeye Cup attracts several thousand visitors, and another major event will be added in 2017, when the Hopewell Cup launches in the first week of October. Although soccer fans want to avoid North 21st Street, Loughlin said, they do look forward to the Kroger Marketplace opening. “We were sorry to see Meijer leave and excited Kroger put in that investment," Loughlin said. Sharon Valley Road The Baker Boulevard extension may take traffic off North 21st, but it will add traffic to Sharon Valley Road, where numerous athletic and education facilities are located. In about a one-quarter mile stretch on Sharon Valley Road is access to Reese Ice Arena, the Newark Rotary Park, the baseball field and Newark campus of Ohio State University and Central Ohio Technical College, North Newark Little League, Evans Athletic Complex and the bike path. Legend Elementary School has 541 students and Liberty Middle School 487 students. The Newark campus enrollment in 2014 was 3,579 for COTC and 2,516 for OSU-N. The ice arena attracts 150,000 people each season, from August to May. A roundabout will be built next year at the Sharon Valley Road-Evans Boulevard intersection, and the entrances to the ice arena and Rotary Park will be moved to the east, further away from the schools. “We studied it for a traffic signal there and the real tough part is busy traffic is a half hour in the morning and a half hour in the afternoon, and the rest of the time, a functioning light is not specifically warranted," Morehead said. The roundabout will be larger than the ones being built in downtown Newark, but will be one lane. Crosswalks will be added. “It’s a learning process for a lot of folks,” Morehead said of the roundabouts. “It keeps traffic moving continuously and it lowers the speed in and out of roundabouts.” A pedestrian bridge will be added later this year over the diversion ditch, connecting the neighborhood and bike path with the schools. There are no sidewalks on Sharon Valley Road. Jordan McWayne, general manager of the Reese Ice Arena, supports the roundabout. “I think it will be nice,” McWayne said.

(DY) and Palo Alto Networks Inc (PANW) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks View All Posts Few would argue that Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) isn’t working hard to rekindle its once-impressive growth. But few would say that work is decidedly paying off. The retailer posted yet another disappointing set quarterly numbers on Wednesday morning, sending Target stock soundly lower in response. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) TGT earned an operating profit of $1.23 per share for the second quarter of the current fiscal year, up a penny year-over-year. That was enough to beat Wall Street projections for $1.12 per share of Target stock, as well as its own forecasts of $1-$1.20 per share. Revenues, however, were off about 8% to $16.17 billion, merely matching sales estimates. That came on same-store sales declines of 1.1%, which were a bit worse than the 0.9% expected. CEO Brian Cornell commented: “While we recognize there are opportunities in the business, and are addressing the challenges we are facing in a difficult retail environment, we are pleased that our team delivered second quarter profitability above our expectations. Looking ahead, we remain focused on our enterprise priorities as we continue to see the benefits of investing in Signature Categories, store experience, new flex-format stores and digital capabilities. Although we are planning for a challenging environment in the back half of the year, we believe we have the right strategy to restore traffic and sales growth over time.” In fairness, Target really is getting its house in order. But that’s little salve to anyone whose Target stock is slumping this morning. Target Stock and Its Headwinds Target generally beats earnings and revenue estimates. However, it has stumbled a few times in recent quarters as company has been struggling with an identity crisis since calendar 2013. The “cheap chic” angle lost its luster versus the “fast fashion” movement employed by its apparel rivals. At the same time, e-commerce giant Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has continued to chip away at hard lines like toys and electronics. Lowe’s Companies (LOW) Faceplants Into a Sell Rating Perhaps more than anything, Target never really shrugged off the 2013 hack that exposed 40 million customers’ debit card data. Revenue has been dwindling ever since, while income has been choppy at best. Anemic profits haven’t even been as strong as suggested on the surface. The float has been whittled down from 663 million shares in 2012 to 604 million as of the end of Q1. Target bought back another 19 million shares last quarter, pulling the total float down to 585 million shares of TGT stock. Still, Target is optimistic it can revive growth by adding product categories, beefing up its e-commerce effort and moving forward with a new kind of store. Target’s Turnaround Effort One of those initiatives was the expansion of its food business. While Target has long offered some groceries, in the latter half of 2015, it widened its selection to perishables such as meat and produce. The idea was to better compete with the likes of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and even dedicated grocery chains such as The Kroger Co (NYSE:KR). The effort drove growth initially, but the company has more work to do on the grocery front. This week, reports surfaced that many of perishables were expiring before they could be sold, implying a lack of grocery foot traffic and/or supply-management challenges. As for e-commerce, Target is still playing catchup after years of not investing enough in its online venue. Digital sales were up 16% during the second quarter, which is an impressive improvement. But online sales still aren’t considered strong enough relative to the opportunity TGT has; they only make up 4% of the company’s revenue. That pace slowed from Q1’s growth rate of 23%. To that end, however Target continues to make strides. TGT recently hired Amazon supply chain executive Preston Mosier to serve as vice president of fulfillment operations. It will need all the help it can get on the online front. Not only was it competing head-to-head with Amazon as well as Wal-Mart, but WMT recently acquired online shopping site Jet.com. That should bolster the brick-and-mortar retailer’s online presence and threat. Perhaps the boldest initiative the company is taking on to buoy the value of Target stock is the development of smaller stores. The 20,000(+/-)-square-foot locales are roughly a tenth of the size of the typical Target store, allowing them to be established in, and serve, neighborhoods rather than the shopping center crowd. Twenty are already up and running, and while Walmart is getting out of the small-store business, Target recently accelerated its small-footprint plans. It now endeavors to open 14 more of the small-footprint stores before the end of 2016. TGT: Looking Ahead The overall assessment of Target’s overhaul efforts have been positive of late. Buckingham Research Group analysts commented earlier this week “We have been impressed with new management’s decisive actions and evidence of improved merchandising and execution, although the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was a modest setback.” Analysts’ collective outlook affirms the sentiment. The pros were looking for an average profit of $5.13 per share, up 19% from the prior year’s second-quarter bottom line. Sales were only expected to fall 4.5% in 2016, though, from $73.8 billion to $70.5 billion. Wednesday’s Vital Data: AAPL, CHK and HAIN But Target reeled in its full-year outlook. It now anticipates same-store sales will be flat to 2% lower for all of 2016, and lowered its earnings guidance from a range of $5.20 to $5.40 per share of TGT to a range of between $5.20 and $5.40. Target stock fell 4% on the downward-revised guidance. Rival Walmart will announce its quarterly numbers on Thursday of this week. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Epler | eepler@pennlive.com on August 20, 2016 4:45 PM, updated August 20, 2016 5:00 PM comments In his 38 seasons coaching Babe Ruth Baseball, Scott Reigle had experienced this rush only once before. Connersville, Indiana was the site of the 2002 Babe Ruth World Series, and Reigle’s Mifflin County chapter emerged as the fifth-best youth baseball team in the United States. While topping that run seemed improbable, there was something about his latest group of handpicked all-stars that activated those same emotions. Turns out, Pennsylvania and Mid-Atlantic Regional titles weren’t enough for this group of 13-year-old ball players. “Once we started tournament play I knew we had a chance to finish high in the state tournament, but thinking about winning a World Series at that time wasn’t on our minds,” said Reigle on his 14-hour drive home from Ottumwa, Iowa, on Friday. Mifflin County didn’t just represent the Rust Belt with pride and sportsmanship, it claimed the county’s first Babe Ruth World Series title with a 5-3 victory over Pearl City (HI) on Thursday. “It was a long term goal but we knew we had to do some other work first. When it comes down to it, it was a total team effort,” Reigle said. “We came up with the key hits every time we needed one. It was the full line-up.” It’s estimated that 60,000 teams in several age groups of Babe Ruth Baseball are scattered over 11,000 leagues across the nation. Mifflin County spent 124 days attacking its portion with grit and, quite frankly, a flair for the dramatic. Mifflin County's 13-year-old Babe Ruth baseball team went from the fields of Pennsylvania to a World Series champion. (Photo courtesy of Bittersweet Studios/Julie Ufema)) Saturday’s parade through the crowded streets of Lewistown was yet another chance to celebrate Mifflin County’s brilliant stretch of baseball. And team effort continued to resonate. When Mifflin County, a select group from the local 10-team league, charged into the state tournament in Belleville, teammates sold ham sandwiches to cover the freight. A tag sale at the Walmart Supercenter in Lewistown, where Saturday’s 11-mile parade route began, helped cover the cost of Mifflin County’s trek to Queensbury, N.Y., for the Mid-Atlantic Regional. And when the long road trip to Iowa was scheduled, dozens of local businesses and corporate sponsors emerged to make sure players were taken care of. The generosity also allowed Andrew Bern to broadcast the games live on WKVA so all of Lewistown could follow the young heroes and their quest to win it all. “Andrew did a nice job,” said Lewistown Sentinel sports editor Jeff Fishbein, who sent correspondent Ray Wilde to cover the action. “A lot of people were asking ‘did you hear the game last night?’ A lot of people and players from the other teams back home were following.” And why not? The action on the diamond was sensational. After clearing the field in Queensbury with a one-run victory in the final, Brycen Hassinger’s RBI single in extra-innings produced Mifflin County’s 4-3 victory over Eau Claire (WI) in the series opener. “I think we kind of trusted each other early on,” said third baseman and pitcher Brian Yetter. “People don’t know this but we relied on each other. Even if we struck out or made an error we couldn’t get down on each other. We knew we could pick each other up. We had confidence in each other. That was the biggest thing.” Later came Ethan Eichhorn’s three-run blast to fuel MC’s triumph over Waterford (CT). A day later, Eichhorn fired a no-hitter over host Ottumwa and watched teammate Casey Conner bash three hits. Reigle’s crew even avenged an earlier loss to West Fargo (ND) 7-6 on the strength of Brian Yetter’s three hits and three RBIs. Even the details of the rematch were dramatic. With three teams -- Mifflin County, Waterford and West Fargo - tied at 3-1 following pool play, the tiebreaker was runs allowed, which handed Mifflin County the top spot. Since 1980, the Pacific Southwest Regional champion had claimed 13 World Series titles. But Hawaii’s Pearl City would not cash No. 14. Mifflin County would rally from a 3-1 deficit and write its own history. “I’m usually pretty calm but I think my coaches were more nervous on Thursday than anybody,” Reigle said. “We had a great crowd there. The people and the community really supported the World Series.” Yetter, Colby Bodtorf, and Conner (MVP) were touted as all-tournament selections, with but not a single interview passed without the credit shifting to teammates. That means Reigle had it right. Only a complete baseball team can bypass improbable. “We joked about it a lot but we never thought it would happen,” said Bodtorf, Mifflin County’s shortstop and pitcher. “It was just playing with my team and having fun. We’re all just a bunch of good ball players that had fun playing.” “I think what I’ll remember is all the times we came back. All the times where it was the fourth inning and we flipped the switch and got the job done,” Yetter added. “Also, the amount of friendships you get out of this. Months down the road that’s what I’ll remember the most.” Follow @threejacker View/Post Comments About Us PA Media Group Advertise with Us Contact Us Send Us a News Tip Frequently Asked Questions Career Opportunities FAQ Community Rules Subscriptions Manage your Patriot-News Subscription e-Newsletters PennLive Sections Home News Sports PSU Football High School Sports Entertainment Pa.

The Bridges Prep board approved the purchase Thursday night contingent on tests and studies confirming the suitability of the site for a charter school campus. Those studies, which will cost about $75,000, include traffic analysis, utilities access and wetlands. “We have worked many years to get to this point. We have 18 acres, and it’s ours once we do our due diligence,” said board chair Dee Matthews. The property is across from the Beaufort-Jasper Water and Sewer Authority water tank, near Goethe Hill Road and south of Cross Creek Shopping Center and Walmart. Bridges Prep’s board anticipates building a 90,000-square-foot facility to house all grades from kindergarten through 12th grade. Although the school only started offering ninth grade this year, by the time the school opens, those students will be juniors. “We fully expect to have our first graduating class graduate from the new facility,” head of school Nick Ithomitis said. “The purchase is contingent on a variety of things that must be done to ensure the site is suitable for a school. But in all honesty, this is a giant leap forward in our quest for a new school.” Bridges Prep was chartered by the state in mid-2012 and opened at near capacity in August 2013. Since then, enrollment has grown by 200-plus students to more than 580 this school year. An almost $10 million federal loan will pay for the land, construction and equipping the new school, though Bridges leaders said they will seek additional funds to expand the project to include all high school grades. For the next two school years, Bridges Prep will continue to operate at three campuses — the main school at 1100 Boundary St., a K-1 school at Celadon on Lady’s Island, and middle and high school grades at nearby Greene Street.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Vacant Wal-Mart property used for Bluecut fire volunteers Saturday Aug 20, 2016 at 8:47 AM Aug 21, 2016 at 9:26 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz VICTORVILLE — The property surrounding a vacant Wal-Mart in the High Desert sprang to life Saturday as emergency personnel used the abandoned building’s parking lot to help those affected by the Bluecut fire. The Southern Baptist Association’s Disaster Relief Team is utilizing the parking lot of the property located on Balsam Avenue and Bear Valley Road in Victorville to prepare hot meals from their mobile disaster relief kitchen. Agency liaison Dawn Dwyer with the State Mass Feeding program said her SBA team of nearly two dozen volunteers will prepare meals for evacuees sheltered at the San Bernardino County Fairgrounds. Dwyer said the SBA nonprofit program is currently assisting several agencies as they battle several fires throughout California. She added that her High Desert team will prepare and deliver hot meals during the evacuation period and beyond. “We’ll be here as long as the Red Cross needs us,” Dyer told the Daily Press Friday. “We have a complete kitchen with sanitation facilities ready to go. Some of our menu items include beef stew, pork ribs, chicken, vegetables and dessert.” The County of San Bernardino and ARC have partnered to activate the county's Mass Care and Shelter Plan by opening the Shelter Operations Compound at the fairgrounds on Thursday. About 80 evacuees sheltered at Sultana High School in Hesperia are being moved to the compound, which provides food, shelter, health care and animal care to residents displaced by the Bluecut fire. Shower and bathroom facilities will also be available for residents, with public information made available to provide evacuees up-to-date information about the Bluecut incident. County Assessor-Recorder-County Clerk Bob Dutton said the shelter includes a mobile office where residents affected by the fire can be served. He added that the office can help assess property loss, obtain recorded documents, speak with Department of Motor Vehicle Officials and insurance providers, and several county program representatives. Regional, civic and community leaders gathered at the fairgrounds on Friday to share how multiple agencies are handling the Bluecut fire, which had already destroyed 96 single-family homes, damaged three others and devoured 213 outbuildings. Red Cross Public Affairs Officer Georgia Duncan told the Daily Press Friday that the SBA group was not allowed to set up at the fairgrounds because there was not enough room. “The Southern Baptist Association team needs a hard concrete surface to set up their mobile kitchen and equipment,” Duncan said. “We’ve contracted with the Southern Baptist Association for years and we appreciate their efforts.” The Wal-Mart property was provided to the ARC for the SBA group by Coldwell Banker Commercial Victorville, said CBC President Jason Lamoreaux.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Latino Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox News Tech Expand/Collapse Search Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Business Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World On Air Tech Home Computers Google Video Games Military Tech War Games Slideshows Computers Tech Q&A: Finding military records, digitizing VHS tapes By Kim Komando Published August 19, 2016 The Kim Komando Show Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print Illustration picture. Easy way to request old military records Q: Kim help! My grandfather served in World War II. You mentioned a way to find old military records with a caller on your national radio show. What was that website called? A: Archives.gov lets you request a family member's service records and browse through photos taken during the war. It's a great place if you're researching family history or want to replace lost or damaged medals. Certain requests require a $25 to $70 flat copying fee. Click here for direct links to order replacement medals and service records. By the way, if you ever miss my show or want to hear certain parts again, get the podcast. Here’s a link on my site to a free trial. Buying and selling on Craigslist Q: My daughter just started college and needs furniture for her new apartment. Where can I find cheap furniture that's still in good shape? A: Craigslist is a great place to look. Be sure to use specific search terms to find the best deals. "Moving," "divorce" and "everything must go" are buzzwords that help locate truly motivated sellers. A jilted spouse, for example, may be willing to sell an ex's favorite chair for a dollar. Someone who's moving out of state may lower their price because they don't have room to take everything with them. I have a list of the 10 top-selling items on Craigslist. Click here to see if any of these money-makers are collecting dust in your closet. Modernizing old videotapes Q: I have a slew of VHS tapes from the kid’s younger years. How can I get them into this century? A: Videotapes have a shelf life of only 10 to 12 years. As time passes, they lose their magnetic signal. The sharpness, quality and color deteriorate. Worst of all, the tape grows brittle and breaks as it’s played. To preserve the content of your videotapes, digitizing them is a must. Here are your choices: Costco, Wal-Mart and Walgreens will all transfer the old video formats to DVD. A Japanese company called Funai, the last company manufacturing VHS players, makes a device that transfers VHS content to DVDs. It’s inexpensive enough for home use and is available from a limited number of retailers, including my store. Click here to learn more about it. Defeating annoying telemarketers Q: I keep getting calls from an insurance company trying to sell me a policy. They always call back even though I hang up on them. How can I stop them from calling? A: If you hang up without specifically stating you're not interested in what they're selling, most telemarketers will mark you down as "no answer" and keep calling. Make sure your phone number is listed in the Do Not Call Registry. If you're really fed up, block these calls altogether. Click here to see three apps that can block these calls or at least notify you that it's a telemarketer on the other line. Breezing through airport security Q: Hi Kim! I'm visiting family next month and the airline recommends I arrive at the airport two to three hours before my flight departs. Is there any way to speed things up? A: The TSA recently introduced PreCheck to reduce wait times at security checkpoints. Visit TSA.gov/precheck to get started. You'll need to set up an appointment to provide the TSA with documentation and fingerprints and to have a background check completed. It costs $85, and the process takes a few weeks while the Department of Homeland Security determines your threat assessment. But once you're cleared, your membership lasts five years and you'll be able to breeze through the security checkpoints at the airport. With the extra time you'll have on your hands, you might be tempted to browse the web while waiting for your flight. But before you log on, click here for tips on reducing your risk of being hacked when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks. Bonus: Updating your iPhone's operating system Q: I keep getting a prompt to update my iOS, but I'm planning on buying a new iPhone this fall. Should I even bother? A. Yes! The latest update to iOS 9.3.4 is really important, especially if you missed the update to iOS 9.3.3. That one fixed a vulnerability that was similar to Android Stagefright, which could allow a hacker to take control of your device by sending a corrupted text message. Version 9.3.4 makes the Pangu jailbreak tool useless and prevents other exploits that use the same software flaw to compromise your operating system. But updating your iOS is only the first step.

Posted: Saturday, August 20, 2016 1:30 am Sakaguchi cares for ‘his’ Explorers Dennis Fujimoto - The Garden Island The Garden Island Newspaper | 0 comments LIHUE — Kauai Police Department officer Troy Sakaguchi said the KPD Explorers go everywhere with him. He was able to get a break from sitting atop the Walmart rooftop Thursday to ensure the Explorers were safely picked up following their tour of manning fishnets to collect funds benefiting the Special Olympics, Kauai. The Explorers worked alongside Special Olympics athletes to collect funds toward its $25,000 goal to get the officers off the rooftop. “Special Olympics is such a good program,” said Joanne Strader, one of the chaperones for the group. “I love this program. Starting as a parent, I’ve been helping for 10 years, becoming a coach and a chaperone for more than 100 Special Olympic athletes on Kauai who range in age from 8 to older than 55 years old.” Strader said Special Olympics takes care of these athletes, sometimes for their entire life. The Cop on Top is one of the program’s signature fundraising efforts where police officers are hoisted atop a store such as the Walmart on Kauai, and help generate funds for the program from shoppers and other supporters. Sakaguchi and KPD Sgt. Jason Matsuoka were hoisted to the Walmart rooftop at 6 a.m. Thursday with a pledge to remain on the roof until 3 p.m. today, or until the $25,000 goal is met. © 2016 Thegardenisland.com.

The world of trademark law is murky indeed Trading blows … Clinton was allowed to trademark ‘Hillary for America’, but ‘Trump for America’ was disallowed. Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images John Sutherland Saturday 20 August 2016 04.00 EDT Last modified on Tuesday 20 September 2016 10.02 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Should’ve seen it coming: the trademarking of public language Read more Last week US swimmer Ryan Lochte found himself wanted for questioning by Rio police over a story about being mugged – one of the two bad things that supposedly happened to him at the 2016 Games (the other was losing to Michael Phelps; the defeat stands, the mugging, it turns out, was made up). One wonders whether Ryan’s ejaculation, on learning that he was wanted back in Brazil, was a bellowing “Jeah!” He trademarked his peculiar victory scream in August 2012, after winning gold in London Olympics. “It means, like, almost everything,” he explained, somewhat unhelpfully. When, in November 2016, she becomes (God willing) the most powerful woman in the world, Potus (untrademarked, apparently) Hillary will be quite within her rights to tell Donald: “You’re fired!” His attempt to trademark that phrase was turned down in 2004. When she began her campaign, Clinton’s camp were luckier in trademarking the phrase “Hillary for America”. “Trump for America” was nixed. Advantage Hillary. Let’s hope it stays that way. Sarah Palin, when she was riding high all those years ago, tried to trademark her own name but apparently botched the application. It would not, one deduces, be hopeful for the world had the fearless Alaskan made it to the highest rung (“did you say blue button? I thought you said red. Ah, well, it’s only Russia”). The government-run intellectual property offices in the US and UK are, on the whole, level-headed in their rulings. Walmart is well on the way to owning everything in the US. But its attempt to trademark the yellow smiley face in 2006 was denied. Emoticons seem immune. Smile on. It’s not clear, however, whether Facebook owns the twin components of “face” and “book”. The US Patent and Trademark Office allowed the company to register “face” in 2010; it does not appear to have successfully registered “book”, though it has asserted copyright on the word in its user agreement since 2012. In 2010 it launched a suit against teaching website Teachbook, which sent shivers through the book and face-product worlds. It’s murky. Best tread carefully. Business needs clear definitions of ownership. But, for chancers, trademarking can be a Las Vegas casino. A small punt can, if the TM gods smile on you, bring unimaginably huge rewards. The cost for a trademark, here and in the US, is around £200. The forms are very simple and (unless you’re Sarah Palin, ) easy to fill in. Unsurprisingly, every year people try their luck. They may well be inspired by the sports announcer Michael Buffer, who, when compering boxing bouts in the 1980s, came up with the resounding command “Let’s get ready to rumble”. Buffer has made more than $400m renting out those five words. Shakespeare should have been so lucky. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Buffer’s trademarked $400m catchphrase Rather more methodical is the self-described “intellectual property entrepreneur” Leo Stoller. Stoller was foresightful enough to trademark, in the early years of the 21st century, the word “stealth”. Internet search engines mean he can now locate any recent use of “his” word. He may well be looking at this article now (I think we’re safe, under the “fair use” rule, but I’m not sure). Every year Stoller fires off a barrage of fierce letters from his web company Rentamark.com, demanding payment for the use of “his” word. Some recipients pay up – sometimes thousands of dollars. Stoller also went to law against the aircraft manufacturer Northrop Grumman for cheekily using “his” word for their B2 “stealth” bomber. Stoller, who is clearly not lacking a sense of humour, has also, the New York Times reports, trademarked the word “chutzpah”. There was some fuss a few days ago about high-street optician Specsavers applying to have the contraction “should’ve” (as in their slogan, “Should’ve gone to Specsavers”) trademark protected. They’ve got past the first round, but I hope they’re unlucky. Taylor Swift is a ferocious trademarker of her song material. I can’t believe she hasn’t put a TM stamp on Should’ve Said No. If she hasn’t, I hope she does quick. I like her more than the optician. Revealed: How copyright law is being misused to remove material from the internet Read more The most recent crop of applications to clear the first hurdle, as listed by the UK Intellectual Property Office, are mainly bland and name-protective. There are some oddities, though. Bella Freud, the fashion designer, wants to trademark “1970”. It seems bonkers. But I suspect it will be valid only as an epithet applied to her line (and very handsome garments they are) of “1970 Wool Jumpers”, emblazoned with the date across their front. I was a bit fazed by BBC Worldwide Limited applying to trademark the word “swashbuckle”. But then someone told me it was the name of a popular pirate-themed comedy game show on children’s TV. All clear. But does that mean no one else can use the word – in historical narrative, for instance – without a Stoller-style letter? Zounds! On hearing the EU referendum result, US brewer Sam Adams opportunistically lodged with US trademark authorities an application for “Brexit”, to be pasted on their upcoming brand of “hard cider”. Speaking for myself and 16 million others, not being able to use the word “Brexit” is no great loss. Cheers. • Orwell’s Nose by John Sutherland is published by Reaktion at £15.

Sabrina Drude, who teaches at a school in San Antonio, Texas, explained to the man that many of her students were from low-income families who could not always afford basic school supplies. Card In a Facebook post, she explained: “So, I was just at Walmart, buying school supplies for my kids, when this man started asking me questions (like why are you buying 150 notebooks?). “I explained that I teach science and it wasn't worth the hassle of trying to get kids to bring their own notebooks, and that it takes away from time I could be teaching them. He then proceeded to pay for my entire cart of classroom supplies. “I started crying and hugged him and asked for a picture. His son was watching the whole thing too. There are some really good people in this world.” She posted the picture on Facebook and Reddit and found the good samaritan who paid the shopping bill. He turned out to be pastor Lester Brown, who explained on the Love What Matters Facebook page: “I responded because I could tell that this lady was willing to do whatever it takes for the success of the kids she is responsible to teach. “It's important that people who are in trusted to empower kids are loved and appreciated for their effort. “Some of the greatest lessons I have learned are central to my life and they came from outstanding teachers and coaches. “I pray that every teacher this year is safe to empower their kids with not only classroom lessons but, more importantly, love and God's love at that.” Mr Brown added that he had been keeping the $100 bill in his wallet, waiting for the right moment he could help someone in need. Back in June, a jogger attacked by angry swarm of a thousand bees thanked the stranger who rescued her. Here’s how a kidney donation helped save seven lives in one day.

The alleged victims — five men and two women — filed the complaint against the U.S.-registered companies, Rubicon Resources and Wales & Co. Universe, and Thai firms Phatthana Seafood Co. and S.S. Frozen Food Co. on June 15. In the complaint, the plaintiffs say they were tricked into working for the companies and were victims of “forced labor, involuntary servitude and peonage” between 2010 and 2012. U.S.-based Wal-Mart is named among the buyers of Phatthana’s shrimp exports, according to the complaint. U.S. District Judge John F. Walter ordered the attorneys to appear in court September 19 to present arguments and evidence. Attorneys for the plaintiffs will also present damage claims and explain their case for U.S. jurisdiction, which the defense claims is lacking. “If counsel fail to file the required joint report or fail to appear at the scheduling conference, and such failure is not otherwise satisfactorily explained to the court, the cause shall stand dismissed for failure to prosecute, if such a failure occurs on the part of the plaintiff,” the court order said. “Default judgment shall be entered if such failure occurs on the part of the defendant.” According to court documents, the defense team on August 3 said the court holds no jurisdiction because the alleged conduct occurred outside the United States. Plaintiffs’ representatives countered that the court holds jurisdiction under both the Torture Victim Protection Act and the Alien Tort Statute, both of which can allow foreigners to seek redress for human rights violations for conduct occurring outside the United States. A call to a defense attorney was not immediately returned. The defense previously won a one-month extension from the original July 15 deadline to submit arguments and evidence, saying their clients were based in rural areas of Thailand that lacked internet access. “Such a delay is like buying time to prepare something, [which] is not good [for us], because this case happened a long time ago,” Keo Ratha, one of the plaintiffs, told VOA’s Khmer service. Moeun Tola, executive director of the Center for Alliance of Labor and Human Rights, also said a quick conclusion of the case was desired. “I don’t support this delay, because the victims have been waiting since 2012 and it’s now 2016,” he said. “They have been waiting for four years.” Credit : Voice of America (VOA) | Photo Credit: AP Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Share on Skype (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Like this: Like Loading...

The retailer pulled the items from its stores, and on Friday it began notifying customers that it will give them a refund on the products, which were produced between August 2014 and July 2016 and sold for as much as $75. Customers seeking a refund can visit Target’s help page on its website. Target is Mumbai-based Welspun’s second-biggest customer, behind Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., according to Bloomberg data. The company makes towels, sheets, rugs and carpets for 18 of the top 30 global retailers. Its other major clients include Wal-Mart Stores Inc., J.C. Penney Co. and Macy’s Inc. It also manufactures the towels for the Wimbledon tennis championships and the Rugby World Cup. “We have informed Welspun that, due to this conduct, we are in the process of terminating our relationship with them,” said Molly Snyder, a Target spokeswoman. “We value the trust that our guests place in us. The Target team will continue to work closely with all vendors to help ensure that the products we offer to our guests meet or exceed their expectations.” Spokesmen for Welspun couldn’t be reached after regular business hours in India. Phasing Out Target said it is phasing out all of its products from Welspun, which it has used as a supplier for more than a decade, though the process will take time since some merchandise has already been shipped or paid for. The withdrawal only includes two lines of Egyptian cotton bedding, and not all of its Egyptian cotton sheets are affected. Egyptian cotton, which has a longer fiber that creates a softer thread than other cotton, often carries a higher price because shoppers consider it to be higher quality. Welspun India is part of Welspun Group, a conglomerate which also owns Welspun Corp. Ltd., a pipe manufacturer that also supplies major oil and gas companies. Welspun India’s sales in the year through March rose 13 percent to 59.8 billion rupees ($891.6 million), and net income climbed 30 percent to 7.03 billion rupees.

But sports footwear and apparel giant Nike Inc saw shares up 3 percent, making it one of the Dow’s biggest gainers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.2 percent at 18,552.57. The broader S&P 500 was down 0.1 percent at 2,183.87 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was essentially flat at 5,238.38. “The market continues to exhibit sideways price action but it is still an upside bias. The market just can’t just sell off with any bad news,” Michael James of Wedbush Securities told AFP. “None of the economic data was really market moving, nor were the Fed comments from the last meeting. They had no impact,” he added. Oil stocks were in negative territory on the Dow, with supermajor Exxon Mobil Corp down 1.3 percent and Chevron 1.2 percent. Wal-Mart shares gave up all of Thursday’s gain which came after the retailer posted better-than-expected earnings, despite absorbing costs from its recent acquisition of the online retailer Jet.com. On Friday the company closed down 2 percent at $72.81. Nike surged after announcing it had formed a supply-chain partnership with private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC. The deal could help the retailer surmount logistics problems.

Lenoir resident Carl Marcus Nivens, 32, a suspect in a vehicle break-in outside the store, was “actively shooting” at police Sgt. Brett Ingram, who returned fire, killing Nivens, Learner said. Learner, district attorney for Burke, Caldwell and Catawba counties, said he made his conclusions after reviewing multiple video accounts of the shooting. He reviewed video surveillance from Walmart, body camera video from officers and preliminary autopsy photos. He also reviewed preliminary toxicology screens that indicated the presence of amphetamines and methamphetamine in Nivens, Learner said. And he read the findings of the lead investigator from the State Bureau of Investigation, he said. Learner met Friday with Lenoir Police Chief Scott Brown, Master Patrol Officer Brandon Thomas and Ingram, confirming to the officers and the department that the shooting was justified. Nivens had pulled a .38 caliber revolver from his waist band and fired at least one shot at police, Brown said in an earlier statement. Nivens ran from officers as they tried to question him about a possible vehicle break-in, Brown said. The store is in the 900 block of Blowing Rock Boulevard. One officer chased Nivens while another was positioned at the entrance/exit near where Nivens was running from police, Brown said. As he neared the exit, Nivens pulled out a gun and fired it toward police, according to the chief’s statement. “The officer giving chase was physically struggling with Nivens during this time trying to stop him,” Brown said. “The officer staged at the entrance returned fire and struck Nivens. Nivens was pronounced dead at the scene.” Other than minor injuries from the struggle with Nivens, no officers were hurt and no other injuries were reported, Brown said. Officers involved in the incident were placed on administrative leave, which is standard practice in such shootings, and returned to duty on Friday.

By Annie Linskey Globe Staff  August 19, 2016 WASHINGTON — Big chunks of the Clinton family’s charitable network would be exempt from a self-imposed ban on foreign and corporate donations if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, loopholes that highlight the complexity of disentangling her from the former first family’s myriad potential conflicts of interest. The most prominent of the exceptions applies to the Boston-based Clinton Health Access Initiative, which in 2014 accounted for 66 percent of spending by the Clinton network of charities. The initiative’s board plans to meet “soon” to discuss whether to participate in the planned restrictions. Adhering to the policy announced by Bill Clinton on Thursday would starve the organization of much of its operating cash and could gut its work of combating the spread of HIV infections and malaria around the world. Advertisement At least two other Clinton-related charities also aren’t immediately affected by Thursday’s decision to limit donations. They include the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, an entity cofounded by the American Heart Association and the Clinton Foundation, and the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership, a joint venture between Bill Clinton and Canadian mining billionaire Frank Giustra. Get Breaking News in your inbox: Find out about important news stories as soon as they break Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here The alliance, a nonprofit that brought in $17.5 million in contributions including money from Nike and the Walmart Foundation, doesn’t have plans to change its fund-raising. View Story Clinton Foundation to ban foreign and corporate donations if Clinton prevails The Clinton Foundation will stop accepting money from corporations and foreign governments if Hillary Clinton is elected president. Judge orders Clinton to answer questions on e-mail use Giustra, in a statement to the Globe, said that his organization would “spin CGEP into an independent entity” to continue its work. “President Clinton and I believe it is important that we continue the work of alleviating poverty around the world,” said Giustra. Advertisement That statement illustrates both the high-minded goals of the Clinton charitable works and the potential for undue political influence if Hillary Clinton occupies the Oval Office. A piecemeal approach to addressing such potential conflicts is the response so far to this challenging juxtaposition of interests. The job of curbing contributions from particular sources is further complicated by the confusing and sprawling network of Clinton-branded charities, which have been collecting cash under an array of legal entities on behalf of the Clintons’ favored causes for roughly 15 years. It is an unprecedented situation in American politics, and a major political hurdle en route to another unprecedented possibility: the first former first lady — and the first lady — with a real shot at the presidency. Bill Clinton’s announcement Thursday also provided Republicans with a new attack line: If the Clinton Foundation could cause conflict of interest for a Hillary Clinton White House, why didn’t the same standard apply to the Hillary Clinton State Department? The Clintons said when President Obama tapped her for the post in 2009 that the foundation’s interests would be walled off from her work at the State Department. In practice, that border proved porous and problematic and prime fodder for political attacks. “You’re going to have every GOP candidate in America asking: ‘Do you believe that the Clinton Foundation should be shut down?’ ” said former House speaker Newt Gingrich. Gingrich said he had a two-hour briefing from the Republican National Committee on the various pieces of the Clinton charitable enterprise. “It is staggering,” Gingrich said. “This is a corrupt institution, run for corrupt purposes.” In financial terms, if not in visibility, the biggest piece of the Clinton charities is the Clinton Health Access Initiative, with offices on Dorchester Avenue. Bill Clinton, Chelsea Clinton, and longtime Clinton lawyer Bruce Lindsey sit on the board of directors for both CHAI and the Clinton Foundation. “CHAI is a separate legal entity from the Clinton Foundation with its own board,” said CHAI spokesman Regan Lachapelle in a statement. “The CHAI board will be meeting soon to determine its next steps.” Shutting off all access to foreign government grants would be potentially crippling to the charity, which relied on such funds for 60 percent of its revenue in 2015, according to the charity’s papers. Another 38 percent of funds came from private foundations, some of which are connected to large corporations, including the Ikea Foundation. Though the CHAI organization is by far the largest piece of the Clintons’ network, it maintains a much lower profile and has a history of failing to follow the rules set up by the related Clinton Foundation to avoid conflicts of interest while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. This charity works in 32 countries and saw a huge increase in foreign donations while she helmed the State Department. But CHAI never reported those increases to the State Department as was required by an agreement hammered out between the charity and the Obama administration. It also failed to report new foreign donations, another requirement. The Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership has been another flashpoint. It was founded to create “social enterprises that help people lift themselves out of poverty,” according to Clinton charity filings. The New York Times revealed that Giustra benefited when Clinton’s State Department signed off on a deal that helped Giustra’s uranium mining interests. Chelsea Clinton and Lindsey also serve on the board for the Alliance for a Healthier Generation. That group already bans funds from food or beverage companies but otherwise “welcomes everyone to the table,” said Megan Corey, a spokeswoman for the organization. “We will continue to follow our own separate fund-raising policies,” she said. The broader ban on corporate and foreign donations also would affect charities under the more narrow auspices of the Clinton Foundation, including the Clinton Presidential Center, which houses the Clinton Library in Little Rock, Ark. This creates a unique problem for the former president: The donation ban does extend to the sprawling library, according to Clinton Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian, and it would therefore be the only one of its kind starved of corporate donations. The Clintons have been making some preparations for the big shift that her possible presidency entails: In 2013, after Hillary Clinton stepped down as secretary of state, the Clinton Foundation embarked on a massive fund-raising endeavour aimed at creating a $250 million endowment. Donors to that cause included people who would now be barred from making contributions to the Clinton Foundation charities, including Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, who offered $1 million from his private charity. Irish billionaire Denis O’Brien also contributed. Annie Linskey can be reached at annie.linskey@globe.com. Follow her on Twitter @annielinskey. Loading comments...

REUTERS/Sue-Lin Wong 4/4 By Sue-Lin Wong | YULIN, China YULIN, China At the section of the Great Wall of China that runs through Yulin, tour guide Gao Jing says she tried to learn English in expectation of the increased number of overseas visitors the city planned to attract as part of its economic transformation. But the international tourists haven't come to Yulin, once a coal, oil and natural gas boom town in the northwestern province of Shaanxi, and in their absence she has forgotten her English. "Sure, there's lots of talk about developing our tourism industry but walking the talk is a different matter," said Gao, who's been a tour guide there for 10 years. "There's an immediate return on investment if you invest in energy. But you may need to wait 10, or even 100 years, if you want to see a return on investment in tourism." The experience of Yulin carries a lesson for other Chinese cities trying to re-tool their economies – establishing a vibrant services sector takes time, and in the meantime you cannot afford to abandon your industrial strengths. As its economy matures, China is trying to steer away from the export and investment-led model that fuelled its dizzy rise towards a more sustainable base built on domestic consumption. Yulin has been a poster child for that attempt to move up the value chain, singled out by the national media as an example of economic transformation worthy of study by other regions. Aside from gushing news articles about Yulin's success in diversifying its economy away from natural resources, the provincial government is notable for releasing a 27-step plan in 2013 about how this economic transformation should occur. But since then things have not gone precisely to plan. A slowing economy has dragged down industries such as tourism and renewable energy, handpicked by the provincial government as new drivers of Yulin's economy. "At the peak of the coal boom we were already thinking about how to transform our economy, move it up the value chain, but it hasn't been the success we'd hoped it would be," said Zhang Changqing, Yulin investment bureau's party secretary. GROWTH LESSONS The goal was for Yulin to shift into services, move away from an economy dominated by state-owned enterprises (SOE) towards one with private businesses at its core, and produce higher value coal, oil and natural gas. Services made up just over 30 percent of Yulin's economy in 2015, and the government has set an ambitious target of raising that to nearly 40 percent by 2020. With a population of 3.4 million, Yulin is a smaller city by Chinese standards, and its fluctuating fortunes highlight the challenges facing similar lower-tier centres. Yulin's published GDP growth rate plummeted to 4.3 percent in 2015, from a high of 23 percent in 2008, although, as at the national level, there are some who doubt that official figures reflect the true state of the real economy. "It's meaningless to look at the official statistics as an indicator of growth," a government official at the local bureau of commerce told Reuters, requesting anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the press. A retired official from a state owned enterprise (SOE) was also sceptical about GDP data. "I look at tax revenue instead, it's been dropping rapidly these past few years," he said. "The problem is there aren't enough people here for us to rely on the services industry to spur economic growth." In the first half of 2016, Yulin's total fiscal revenue dropped 21.2 percent from the previous year, according to official statistics, and investment in services plummeted 36.6 percent in 2015. CAN'T ALL HAVE A TERRACOTTA ARMY Exacerbating Yulin's difficulties, nearby cities that were similarly reliant on traditional industries, such as Ordos and Baotou in Inner Mongolia, are trying to attract comparable kinds of investment projects and develop industries such as tourism. "It's hard for us to develop a tourism industry. We don't have the same history as Xi'an," the retired SOE official said, referring to the ancient home of China's terracotta warriors. "You come to Yulin maybe once in your life and you're finished seeing the whole city in half a day." The government is also trying to boost consumption, both through e-commerce and bricks and mortar stores, but locals have been hesitant to spend in the downturn, with Walmart Stores Inc (WMT.N) pulling out of Yulin early last year, Zhang from the investment bureau told Reuters. Meanwhile real estate projects, a favourite growth stimulant for local governments in China, have dried up, meaning fewer jobs for migrant worker and less demand for raw materials. Sprinkled around the city are empty or half-completed apartment buildings, a far cry from the days locals planted their excess cash made from the resources boom in property. "Most of these projects are from years ago and many of them stopped mid-way, when the developers and construction companies ran out of money," said the official at the commerce bureau. Blessed with abundant sunshine and wind, the government is hoping to develop the region's renewables industry, but demand for energy and electricity has shrunk as the property sector has tanked. To be sure, Yulin hasn't abandoned the industries that fuelled its economic boom - indeed, some of its efforts to make its oil and coal companies more competitive are starting to pay off. The Yulin Coal Trade Center has shifted from logistics and quality control to providing clients with a full supply chain, from procurement to financing options, according to Luo Wenjie, from the company's operations department. Their clients are scattered around the country, and mostly find the company on popular online platforms such as WeChat. "Unlike smaller companies that may swap out Yulin's high-quality coal for lower-quality coal, we're big enough to provide clients with peace of mind that we won't do that," said Luo, adding that the company has 100,000 employees. "Our competitive advantage is that we aren't going to run off with our client's money."

She just received a retirement check from the people who manage the retirement for her old job, and now she doesn't know how to cash it. The check is around 1800 dollars and made out to my mom. My mom finally received a retirement check, which is basically just a check for 1800 dollars. She was operating under the assumption that she could just sign the check over to me and that I (her son) could deposit it into my bank account where we could use it to help pay some of her bills. She recalls doing this with other checks, but honestly that was a long time ago and the checks were much smaller. I called my bank and asked about this and they were extremely unhelpful. I was told that if I wanted to cash that check, I would have to bring my mom down to the local bank branch to sign paperwork stating that she understood that she was signing the money over to someone else. When I told them she was homebound and had difficulty leaving her house they basically got even more unhelpful, basically telling me to get her to the bank that originated the check. That is definitely not a possibility, because that isn't even a local bank. I got the distinct impression that either they didn't want to deal with this situation, or, even though they looked up my account info and could see I've been banking with them for 15 years, they were suspicious that I was trying to do something funny. I've basically ruled my bank out as an option, and the other places around that I've been suggested to try are the local Walmart, which will cash checks, and another local to my area store that is well known for check cashing, with a fee structure similar to Walmart. I've also got the usual assortment of check cashing joints but was treating them as a last resort. Does anyone have any recommendations for what I should do in this situation? Should I try again with my bank or can I do this elsewhere? Thanks in advance. posted by FireballForever to Work & Money (12 answers total) 1 user marked this as a favorite   Some banks allow you to open a checking account entirely online - I think that Chase is one of them, for instance. Try calling them and ask about how to open the account without going to a branch, then have her open the account online, then you can deposit the check into it (through their mobile app, if you use Chase), have her write out a check to you, and close the account. Annoying, and you might have to wait a week or so for the check to clear into her account, but it should work. posted by the agents of KAOS at 1:08 PM on August 21 [6 favorites] Seconding the suggestion from the agents of KAOS. Schwab does this as well and the limit for deposits via the mobile app is $10000. posted by asphericalcow at 1:12 PM on August 21 I did this earlier this year. On the top of the endorsement section in the back, I wrote "Pay to the Order of:" then added the full third party name on the second line, and signed the third line. It went through fine to the third party. Banks involved were PNC and Wells Fargo. I would call the originating bank and ask if they allow third-party endorsements of their checks. Or call your bank again and see if you get someone else on the phone, someone who has some empathy... Otherwise, I would do what the agents of KAOS suggested and open a free online account for her, deposit the check, and then send you the money for bills. Might be worthwhile for her to have an account in her name anyway, and there are online only accounts that don't have annual fees. posted by gemmy at 1:13 PM on August 21 [2 favorites] Yes, open a no fees account for her in her name-there is a good chance future situations will arise that can be handled more simply if she has one. posted by koahiatamadl at 1:24 PM on August 21 [3 favorites] I (very recently) used to be a teller, and the bank I worked for was fairly liberal with these kinds of things. With third-party checks over $1000 the general requirement was: "Pay to the order of _____", both parties' endorsements, and we either needed to have a very trusting relationship with the customer and/or needed to verify the original payees endorsement. Usually this can be handled with a clear photo or a photocopy of their ID card that has a genuine endorsement. These checks also needed to be approved by a supervisor or lead teller in order to get a second verification and make sure the account holder's account won't get charged-off if the check charges back. and to see if there's any suspicious history with the account holder's account. Simple as pie. Good luck. posted by omgkinky at 1:38 PM on August 21 [3 favorites] Another option is to open a new account with a local credit union. Have it opened as a joint account with you and her as co-owners. She is not receiving any disability payments or social security payments? The SSA requires that the recipient have a bank account for direct deposit, unless she elects to have the funds deposited to a debit card for her use. posted by yclipse at 2:32 PM on August 21 [3 favorites] She could open an online-only bank account. Ally (formerly GMAC) doesn't have physical branches at all. You don't need to talk to a human to open an account, even. You can deposit checks by mail and online. Online is super easy and the limit is $50,000/day, so you're well under. From there, she can do what she wants with the money. You can order checks from Ally online, which would let her write checks to whoever. posted by BungaDunga at 2:34 PM on August 21 [2 favorites] You don't mention whether your mom has an ATM card, or if her bank has an ATM. If the answer is 2 yeses there, you can deposit the check that way for her after she's endorsed it. If the bank has a smart-phone app you could use that to deposit the check. This would require some set-up steps, of course, on your phone (or hers, although this sounds unlikely) and maybe some set-up for her account. but it's really easy. This would be easier, I think, than creating a whole new account for her. posted by qurlyjoe at 5:15 PM on August 21 [3 favorites] A joint account with online access is probably a good idea, especially if you're helping her out with other expenses on an on-going basis. Was this check a one-time deal, or will it be a regular thing (monthly?) If it's ongoing, can you set up direct deposit (into, hopefully, an account that you share with your Mother)? You should also consider asking your mother to give you Power of Attorney. There are free forms, but you'll probably need to have it notarized, and you'd be better off working with an elder care lawyer in your jurisdiction (the Bar association in your state may be able to hook you up with pro/low bono resources, if cost is a concern). POA's are an easy route to financial abuse, so it's not a decision that your mother should take lightly, but if she is disabled and homebound it might be best for someone she trusts to be able to act in her stead. If you had POA from your mother, your bank would probably be quite a bit more receptive to you cashing her checks. posted by sparklemotion at 8:21 AM on August 22 Is your mother on disability or receiving state benefits? If so I would ABSOLUTELY NOT open an account in her name, as that would require her SSN and any income she receives could affect her benefits. I was a bank teller many moons ago. We saw third party endorsed checks all the time. Worst case scenario is there is a 3- 5- or 10-day hold on the funds depending on the bank, but otherwise it shouldn't be a problem. If this is going to be a regular disbursement (monthly) she will probably need a bank account as she will need to report taxes so if she gets benefits they are going to be affected anyway. If the disbursement is less regular perhaps you can work with the company to find a different way to pay out. posted by vignettist at 9:16 AM on August 22 [1 favorite] This check is a one time only thing. I called my local branch and they told me that I would have to bring her there (even after I told them she was homebound) to sign paperwork stating that she understood she was signing the check over. I called the corporate office above the branch and they said that they would do it. So it sounds to me like the branch is adding extra steps to cover themselves against fraud. I called the corporate office after talking to my local branch and they told me to just have her sign it on the back and I would also sign it and deposit it, the way I always understood that it was done. posted by FireballForever at 11:06 AM on August 22 [2 favorites] Traveling Notaries are a thing and they exist for precisely this situation. If the bank continues to give you a problem after you've followed their steps that you outlined in your update, tell them to give you the paper and you will have it notarized. I can't believe they didn't suggest it to you. posted by vignettist at 8:42 PM on August 22 [1 favorite] « Older My kippot are the best, believe me   |   Washing machine drain pump help!

Follow us on Home Oman Region World Opinion Sports Business Features Videos About us Archives Blogs PDO supports training of 300 Omani women August 21, 2016 Muscat -  The Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) is supporting the training of 300 Omani women job seekers. The company has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Fashion Apparels which will employ the school leavers on successful completion of a six-month course at its factory in the Salalah Free Zone, stated a press release. The garments firm has opened a new US$20mn production unit on the site and plans to export around 12mn goods a year. At its full capacity by 2018, it aims to employ 500 Omanis. Under the terms of the pact, PDO is committed to sponsor the women through the tailoring training programme, which will include teaching them sewing machine techniques, English communication and computer skills. The company aims to extend its job creation efforts beyond the oil and gas industry to other sectors of the economy. The agreement was signed by Suleiman al Mantheri, external affairs and communications manager, PDO and Harinder B S Lamba, executive director, Fashion Apparels at PDO’s Knowledge World centre in Qurm. Raoul Restucci, managing director, PDO said, “PDO is pleased to partner with Fashion Apparels on this vocational training programme which will provide hundreds of Omani women with jobs in the clothing industry. “PDO is dedicated to supporting the sultanate’s economy by expanding work opportunities for both Omani men and women so that they can create a sustainable future for themselves. “This means we will be supporting more vocational training for nationals beyond our natural boundaries in the oil and gas industry to aid economic development and diversification in other sectors.” They will work on items for leading brands such as Walmart, Macy’s and J C Penney. Hassan Khashoub, human resources manager, Fashion Apparels said, “We are committed to developing young Omanis who have the right attitude to work. As the required skills are not available in Salalah, we are designing our own training programme in collaboration with PDO. The programme will have a combination of technical and soft skills aimed at grooming youngsters to take up management position in the due course of time.” The tailoring course, which will include technical and on-the-job training, is being run by the Arabian Training Institute in Salalah. Mantheri said, “We are now also committed to diversifying our support outside our core business to help the development and employment of Omanis in other economic sectors. “Besides partnering with Fashion Apparels, PDO also recently signed an agreement with Oman Air to support the training of job seekers in a variety of cabin and ground staff positions, along with the upskilling of a further 100 existing Oman Air customer service staff. This approach underlines the central role that PDO plays to support His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said’s aim of greater Omanisation and extending professional capacity and capability of Omanis.” Similar content PDO supports training of 300 Omani women PDO partners with Salalah Port on social investment project Daleel Petroleum enters into three-year partnership with Outward Bound Oman Daleel, Injaz sign MoU for Sharikati programme ITA signs pacts to train for job seekers, entrepreneurs Contact us  Privacy policy Sitemap  RSS feeds  To subscribe Ⓒ​  2014   Apex Press and Publishing ,  PO Box 2616,  Ruwi 112, Muscat,  Sultanate of Oman   Telephone: +968-24799388, Fax : 24787573

Startup catches the wave H.E. Neter Kush Ben Alkebulan is co-founder and chief beverage officer of the Palm Beach County startup that makes Banana Wave bananamilk, which is sold in Whole Foods.

Banana Wave, from Fresh Start Beverage Co., is sold in Whole Foods Markets in Florida. kobe4l 1 of 4 i By Nancy Dahlberg ndahlberg@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Company name: Fresh Start Beverage Co. (Banana Wave) Headquarters: Palm Beach Gardens Concept: Fresh Start Beverage Co. is creating a new category in the milk-alternative industry. “We are the first company to actually make milk from a universally loved fruit — bananas. We call it Banana Wave,” said H.E. Neter Kush Ben Alkebulan, co-founder and chief beverage officer. Story: Entrepreneurial passion can take you to places you never thought you’d go. For these co-founders, getting their business off the ground meant living in a car for a while — and success still means donning a banana suit. Fresh Start Beverage Co.’s mission is to make humanity healthy, happy and strong one refrigerator at a time, said Neter, who founded the Palm Beach County startup along with his fiancée Trendolyn Hopkins and his mother Claudette Patron. Their first product is a nondairy beverage called Banana Wave banana milk. Neter says the delicious superfood originated in Africa’s Nile Valley around 3000 B.C., and has been his family’s specialty for generations. While attending Florida Memorial University and working three jobs in 2012, he and Hopkins went to the Nova Southeastern University library every night to learn everything they could about business plans and running a company. Saving money by living in a car for six months, they went all-in working on their business full time in 2014; their first break came that year, when they won the People’s Choice award in Florida Atlantic University’s business plan competition and a couple of others. The winnings, plus about $727,300 raised from family, friends and angel investors after the contests, allowed them to spend most of 2014 and 2015 testing out the product in farmers markets across South Florida, including ones run by Whole Foods, gathering feedback and making tweaks, testing price points and making sales. By January of this year they had the product made commercially and began selling it. In May, their big break came: Banana Wave is now in Whole Foods throughout the state. The couple have done demonstrations (Neter wears a banana suit) at stores throughout the summer. The banana milk is a first for Whole Foods, Neter said. “They sell a lot of products but they have never seen anything like Banana Wave.” He has had meetings with Wal-Mart and Kroger over the summer. Wal-Mart has already said yes, Neter said, and they are discussing 2017 launch plans. “I really want to get into Publix; Publix is on my radar.” Launched: March 19, 2013 Management team: Co-founders H.E. Neter Kush Ben Alkebulan, chief beverage officer; Trendolyn Hopkins, chief brand officer; Claudette Patron, chairman of the board. No. of employees: 9 Website: bananawave.com, www.facebook.com/drinkbananawave Financing: $727,300 raised from family, friends and angel investors. Recent milestones reached: Expanded distribution into the Northeast, through Market Basket, into the Southwest, through HEB, and into the West Coast, through Unified Grocers. Won the Category Pioneer Award in Beverage World Magazine in July. Currently working on a chocolate version of Banana Wave. Biggest startup challenge and why: “Our biggest startup challenge was obtaining distribution for Banana Wave. We created the new category so food & beverage distributors had no historical data to rely on to determine sales volume,” Neter said. Next steps: Obtain a national presence within Whole Foods Market. Give back to the community by sponsoring sporting events and local festivals. Provide impeccable service to distributors and retailers, while creating healthy beverage products that add value to consumers’ lives.

District Attorney David Learner reached his conclusion after reviewing videos captured by the store and police body cameras, multiple media organizations reported. Learner said preliminary toxicology tests also found amphetamines and methamphetamine in the bloodstream of 32-year-old Carl Marcus Nivens, who was killed. The Lenoir resident was a suspect in a vehicle break-in outside the store and was shooting at police Sgt. Brett Ingram, who returned fire and killed Nivens, Learner said. Ingram and another police officer who had been on the scene of Tuesday's shooting had been placed on administrative leave, which is standard practice. They returned to duty on Friday. "The officers' decisions to use deadly force were fully justified and undoubtedly avoided injury to the officers and innocent bystanders," Learner said in in a statement Friday. "Nivens was actively shooting at Sgt. Ingram who returned fire, killing the suspect." Both Nivens and Ingram were white. Two others who were with Nivens were arrested on outstanding warrants for unrelated charges. Officers responded to the Walmart after employees reported suspicious activity. Nivens tried to flee from the store as officers tried to question him about the possible vehicle break-in, Police Chief Scott Brown said last week. Nivens pulled a .38 caliber revolver from his waist band and fired at least one shot at police, Brown said. Other than minor injuries from struggling with Nivens, no officers were hurt and no other injuries were reported, Brown said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Apologizing for Bad Behaving Whites is the Norm. August 21, 2016 by Staff   Filed under News, Opinion, Sports, Weekly Columns Leave a Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 1 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) The issue is not the bad behavior, lies, or even white privilege that was nakedly on display in the case of the prevaricating white Olympic swimmers. The issue is, as always, the boundless storehouse of apologizing for bad behaving, and more times than not, law breaking young and no so young whites, and especially athletes and celebrities. It started with the networks, and much of the media, virtually giving nearly as much coverage to the made-up robbery as the coverage of the Olympic games, then doubling down by practically tarring Brazil as a rogue state chock full of corrupt and lawless cops and officials. Then the capper was giving the ringleader, Ryan Lochte, a platform before millions on the Today Show to say this to Matt Lauer: “I wouldn’t make up a story like this nor would the others — as a matter of fact we all feel it makes us look bad. We’re victims in this and we’re happy that we’re safe.” His “victims” claim was unchallenged. An International Olympic Committee spokesperson then chimed in: “I do not regret having apologized. No apologies from him or other athletes are needed. We have to understand that these kids came here to have fun. Let’s give these kids a break. Sometimes you make decisions that you later regret. They had fun, they made a mistake, life goes on.” This boys will be boys depiction also was unchallenged. It simply added to the other characterizations of them and their hijinks as immature, fun and games, or at worst simply irresponsible, with only the vaguest suggestion that their conduct tainted the U.S.’s swim efforts. The swimmers are hardly the first white athletes to benefit from the blatant racial double-standard. It goes like this. When black athletes are accused of or are guilty of wrongdoing, their punishment is swift and harsh. The public is merciless. They are pounded pitilessly by the media and they become the eternal poster boys for deviancy and criminality. When whites admit to or are accused of wrongdoing there is much handwringing, apologetics, and kid glove rationalizations to explain their behavior, and their names quickly disappear from the headlines. I can always count on the media to beat to death, revive, and beat to death again the in and out of sports world misdeeds of black athletes. And just as predictably, I can count on it to brush aside, apologize for, or make objects of sympathy the misdeeds of white pro athletes. Countless studies have been cited that names names, dates and places that compare and contrast how whites that commit crime, even mass murder, are routinely apologized for, sanitized, psychoanalyzed, or simply ignored. This in brutal comparison to how blacks, even black victims of white crimes, are depicted. The Huffington Post did a telling compare and contrast of the ritual apologetics for misbehavior or lawbreaking by whites and blacks citing several well-publicized recent cases. In an Alabama multiple murder case in 2010, the white suspect, a college professor, was described as “brilliant, but a social misfit.” In the shooting death of a Black in Montgomery, Alabama, the description was “the homicide victim had a history of narcotics abuse, tangles with the law.” A New York man, who was a star athlete, killed his parents in 2010, was depicted as mentally challenged “brilliant, athletic—but his demons were the deaths of his parents.”  Trayvon Martin, murdered by George Zimmerman, was repeatedly raked over the coals for alleged drug use, and his school suspensions. This in contrast to the 15-year-old Oregon school shooter who shot up his school in 2014, a headline read, “school shooting suspect fascinated with guns, but was a devoted Mormon, his friends say.” When mass murderer, Elliot Rodgers, went on his shooting rampage at U.C. Santa Barbara in 2014, there was much media soul searching trying to get inside his head. This was neatly summed up in a headline that read, “Suspect was soft-spoken, polite, a gentleman, says ex-principal.” There were no such personality probes, human interest peaks, or psychoanalyst coach analysis for John Crawford III who was gunned down at a Walmart in Richland, Ohio, after a report that he was carrying a toy gun in the store. The state attorney general defended the shooting by claiming that the gun was not really a toy. Yet when an Ohio teen killed three students in 2012 he was described in a headline story as “a fine person.” The template has been set in stone in just about every mass shooting by whites going back to Columbine in 1999. There is a desperate search to psychoanalyze the shooters, give a warm and fuzzy depiction about their backgrounds and up-bringing through interviews with their parents, teachers and friends, and then make it abundantly clear that they are aberrations. Blacks whether accused of crime or victims get no such pass. So there’s really no need to ask the perennial what if question, that is if it had been black members of the U.S. Olympic basketball team that lied shamelessly about the alleged robbery what the headlines and the furor would have looked and sounded like. The sordid history of who gets painted as victims when they misbehave and how gets savaged as villains when they do the same tells us the answer.

Bushman owns the business with her brother, Joseph Bushman, not pictured. URBANA — A Champaign woman has opened a boxing gym for women in Urbana. Jessie Bushman launched CU Women's Boxing at 1908 N. Linview Avenue, Unit 1E, to meet a growing demand in the area. Bushman, who has been boxing for six years and is a certified USA Boxing coach, decided to establish a place where other women can experience the same benefits she received, with the help of her brother and business partner, Joseph Bushman. "I know what it's like to feel defeated, to feel frustrated, weak and small ... to not know what the next steps are or how to take them," Bushman said. "I also know what it's like to feel strong, to finish a workout and feel exhausted and proud of the limits you just pushed ... to feel empowered because, even though you aren't the fastest or the strongest one, you are becoming the best version of you. That's what I want to do here at CU Women's Boxing." Bushman teaches basic boxing skills and helps women to tone up and increase their muscular strength and cardio endurance. She offers group classes during the week as well as private sessions for one-on-one training. And if a group of girlfriends want to get together for a boxing/cardio workout, Bushman can make that happen, too. Bushman's boxing workouts tend to stress the fitness aspects of the sport. "Boxing is great for energy, for getting out any aggressions and for improving self-esteem," Bushman said. Classes are offered at 6 a.m. Monday, Wednesday and Friday; 9 a.m. Tuesday and Thursday; 5:30 and 7 p.m. Monday and Wednesday and 7 and 9 a.m. Saturday. For more information call 217-819-0023 or go to cuwomensboxing.com. Rogards stays in family Rogards office supply and furniture store now has a sole owner, but she's a part of a family that has helped run the downtown Champaign business for decades. On Aug. 1, Tuscola native and Tolono resident Tonya Horn purchased the shares of former co-owners Chad and Catherine Hoffman and became the single owner for the 110-year-old company at 214 S. Walnut St. Horn says that Rogards has been part of her blood all of her life. Her father, Terry Poindexter, had worked for Rogards since the late 1970s and purchased it with some business partners in the 1990s before selling the business in 2011 to Horn and the Hoffmans. "The majority of our sales is business-to-business," Horn said. "Most people see the retail store out front, but we are much more than that. The store is only a fraction of our business." Rogards sells office supplies and furniture to other area businesses. And nearly half of Rogards' business comes by way of the internet. "About 40 percent of our sales were done online this year at rogards.com," she said. Horn said she wanted to purchase the outstanding shares to honor her father's involvement with the business. "I realized that Rogards is incredibly important to him and to my family," she said. "Also, I missed doing something that was a part of the community. I want to be connected to other businesses, and this is a really cool opportunity to do that." Horn said the best part of her job is meeting other business owners in the Champaign-Urbana community. Now that Horn is the sole owner, she said she plans to hire more staff (it currently has 16 employees). "We are going to keep our focus on making sure we give the customers the same great, flexible, local service they are accustomed to receiving," she said. "I'm proud of the way our entire team has worked together to position Rogards well now and into the future." In addition, Rogards is expanding its product line to offer janitorial products, safety solution products and items for break rooms. Rogards is open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. It is closed on Saturday and Sunday. Baking business starts up An Urbana woman has launched a home baking business. Brittany Brown started Brittany's Sweet Spot at 906 E. Harding Drive, #203, U, in June. Brown said she bakes cakes, cookies and a variety of different desserts. "I went to school at Le Cordon Bleu in Atlanta, Ga., to learn baking and pastry making, so I wanted to start up my own business," Brown said. "You can call and order a cake. I will deliver it, or you can pick it up at my house." Brown said she will have a booth at the Urbana Market in the Square in September. For more information or to order a cake, call Brown at 278-0279. New food truck A new food truck in Champaign serves a variety of Mexican food. Fernando Leonor of Urbana started up Fernando's Food Truck earlier this summer. Leonor said the truck serves burritos, quesadillas, nachos, tacos and more. "I am committed to offering authentic Mexican food," Leonor said. Many days the truck can be found for lunch between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. at Neil Street and University Avenue. Then Leonor moves his truck to Springfield Avenue near Locust Street, where he serves until 7 p.m. New owner for nail salon A nail salon at the Champaign Wal-Mart store has a new owner. Ngan Tram of Champaign took over as owner of Regal Nails, 2610 N. Prospect Ave., on Aug. 19. The business does manicures and pedicures. It is open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Saturday and 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday. Recycling shutting down Green Purpose LLC, a green ecocapitalist enterprise that "provides profitable, personalized and sustainable solutions for commercial businesses" at 808 Pioneer St., C., announced last week that its Green Purposes recycling division will be shutting down its operations and closing its processing facility. "This division of Green Purpose has been a great success until the collapse of the commodities market last year and must be done in order for us to move forward with the other successful components of our business model." said CEO Steven T. Rosenberg. "It has been an honor and a privilege to serve this community over the last seven years of my life and wouldn't take it back for anything." He noted that the division kept millions of pounds of material waste out of landfills. Rosenberg said the business will continue its consulting services, social media coaching and online multimedia platforms. "This is simply the end of a chapter and not the end of a story," Rosenberg said. "We will continue down the path of environmental passion and legacy by helping change the world for our future generations." Yogart shop closes A sign on the door at City Girl Yogurt at Five Points at 202 E. University Ave., U, says it is closed until further notice. Nobody answered the shop's telephone number last week. Beta testers needed University of Illinois Research Park startup Serionix is seeking beta testers for its newest product: an air filter that changes colors to alert a homeowner when it expires. The color-changing filters received positive feedback from the initial round of testing, where they were proven to be effective against pet, cooking and mildew odors. The filter's goal is to keep homes cleaner and healthier. Serionix is looking for more beta testers who are dealing with an odor issue in their home. Both portable air purifier units and furnace filters are available. There are only a limited number of spots left in the beta test. If interested, email kayenelson@serionix.com or call Kaye at 602-384-6122. Pharmacy for Fisher Dave Hinton of The Rantoul Press reports a new pharmacy will soon open in Fisher. Chad Mines, Fisher Area Business Association chairman, said electrical and drywall work are ongoing at the pharmacy building. "It looks good," said Mines, who is a contractor on the project. The TelePharm pharmacy involved local residents committing $50,000 to bring the business to town. TelePharm, which began in Iowa in 2012, uses a model where a pharmacy technician will always be in the store, but a registered pharmacist will share time among several locations and dispense medication through teleconferencing. TelePharm invested more than $150,000 to open the store. The local investors will be guaranteed 25 percent of the profits. Tourism aids county A study recently released by the Illinois Department of Commerce's Office of Tourism showed visitor spending has increased in Champaign County. Overall in Illinois, expenditures by travelers in the state topped $37 billion in 2015, a 2.6 percent increase from 2014. In addition, the industry created over 10,000 new jobs in 2015, a 3.5 percent increase from 2014. Locally, expenditures of travelers during their time in Champaign County topped $330 million in 2015. The study also showed that local tax revenue in Champaign County reached $5.6 million in 2015. "We continue to see the growth of travel and tourism in Champaign County, with a 2.3 percent increase in visitor spending resulting in a 3.3 percent increase in jobs and a 7.2 percent increase in payroll," said Jayne DeLuce, president and CEO of Visit Champaign County. "Our team continues to share our 'Outside of Ordinary' story to leisure, business, sports and international travelers, resulting in significant impact to our community, our businesses and our residents." Events cited as contributing to the increase included the Hot Rod Power Tour at Parkland College (with 3,700 participants), the MVP Illinois Lacrosse Tournament and the Half Century of Progress.

Under the new standards, heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans must become 2.5 percent more efficient each year between 2021 and 2027. Heavier vehicles, including tractor-trailers, delivery trucks and school buses, will have to produce 25 percent lower carbon emissions and fuel consumption compared to existing standards, over the same period. Vehicles included in the new standard are about 5 percent of all vehicles on U.S. roads, but they produce about 20 percent of all vehicular carbon emissions. Major companies that rely heavily on trucks, including Wal-Mart, Waste Management and FedEx, have endorsed the new standards. Although the technology to produce the reduced emissions will increase the cost of a new heavy vehicle by up to $14,000, the improved fuel efficiency resulting from the improvements will cover that cost within two years, according to government and industry estimates. Over the long term, the increased fuel efficiency will produce substantial savings for the companies and consumers who purchase the shipped goods. Fuel is, by far, the largest expense in trucking. “It’s good for business; it’s good for the environment; it’s good for our economy overall,” Brian Mormino of Cummins Inc., the world’s largest manufacturer of engines for heavy-duty vehicles, told The Washington Post. The new standard is an inspirational demonstration that the quests for cleaner air and profits need not be mutually exclusive.

South African travellers in Africa have become used to seeing familiar brands in shopping malls and high streets across the continent, but soon their compatriots from other African countries might experience a similar local-brand-weariness when shopping for goods, especially groceries, even while on trips away from home. Booming African brands and improving intra-African trade might be seen as a reason to rejoice for the Afrocentric shopper but others, who have grown tired of the ever-expanding influence of home-grown giants, might just roll their eyes and seek out a less formal option. If they headed to the markets and informal traders they would be joining around 90 percent of the continent’s population who still do their shopping there. Deloitte on Tuesday released its inaugural African Powers of Retailing 2015 report, which ranks South African retailers in the top 10 positions, but a closer look at the wider survey reveals more subtle trends. Deloitte plans to use the new annual report to track the progress of the top African listed retail performers on the continent. Of the top 25 African retailers, with a combined presence in 21 countries, 10 now come from countries outside South Africa, with three Zimbabwean retailers, two from Botswana and one each from Kenya, Morocco, Tunisia, Nigeria and Zambia. Botswana’s Choppies was the fastest growing retailer of the top 25 African retailers of 2015, recording 24.4 percent year-on-year growth for fiscal year 2013 over 2012. Shoprite was named the number one retailer in Africa, followed by Massmart Holdings and Pick n Pay, with Spar Group claiming fourth place and Woolworths coming in at number five. A total of 36 percent of the top 25 listed retailers are involved in food and beverage retailing, with 24 percent focused on clothing and accessories. Speaking at the launch of the report, Dylan Piatti, Deloitte’s chief of staff for consumer business in Africa, said: “The more mature South African retail market has performed strongly from a continental perspective, which is one of the reasons international retailers who are eager to establish a footprint on the African continent have tended to enter via South Africa. However, there is an emerging shift in the regional focus of entry, as well as key players looking beyond African borders for expansion opportunities in Asia and the UK.” The potential inherent in the African market is underscored by the fact that, according to the UN Economic Commission for Africa, approximately 90 percent of transactions in the African retail market still occur through informal channels. This peaks at 96-98 percent in key West African markets such as Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon. This compares to just 40 percent in South Africa, as the continent’s most mature retail market. The potential is astonishing when one considers another statistic from Deloitte: the top 25 listed retailers in Africa collectively earned retail revenue of $44.3-billion in the fiscal year 2013, contributing approximately 5.4 percent to the total African retail market size of $823.2-billion. A significant number of international retailers have entered the African market in recent years, notably Wal-Mart which purchased a controlling share in Massmart in 2011. Other retailers include Mango, Topshop, Zara, Cotton On, and luxury brands Prada and Hugo Boss – the latter being the only entrant outside South Africa. E-commerce is another area set for massive growth in Africa. An expected surge in mobile internet access means that the 20 percent of Africa’s population that is online is expected to rise sharply (closer to Asia’s 32 percent or even Europe’s 75 percent), which is expected to help e-commerce sales reach $75-billion by 2025. It is unlikely that Deloitte’s Piatti was referring only to the big South African brands when he added, “Africa has become a laboratory for experimentation in mobile and ecommerce, and presents a challenging opportunity.” – Africa Independent Related Posts ‘Fastjet transports 2m passengers’ HARARE - Low-cost pan-African airline, Fastjet, says it has transported over two million passengers across the African skies since launching in November 2012.

And it’s coming to Clearfield County next month, thanks to the owners of Starr Hill Vineyard and Winery in Curwensville. It’s similar to reality television, but it’s not scripted, said Kenn Starr. He and his father, Ken Starr, are co-owners of the winery and members of Team 88 that will wend their way from the start in Ellicottville, N.Y., to their vineyard and winery on Sept. 25 and through to the other stops. The public is invited to Starr Hill Winery for free, beginning about 2:30 p.m., where 40 teams plus undisclosed celebrities will arrive in spiffy vehicles, such as Maseratis and Ferraris. The Starrs will be in their less-sexy 2016 Chrysler Town & Country minivan, a delivery truck for the winery. “Star cars,” including the Delorean Time Machine from the movie, “Back to the Future,” also are scheduled to be there. A dinner that evening is by ticket only, $60 per person, available by calling the winery. The next day, the cars will line up in downtown Clearfield and await the green flag about 8 a.m. to depart for the next stop, Cumberland, Maryland. Besides fun for the participants, another purpose of Fireball Run is to shine light on off-the-beaten-path locales. Remote locales “I think this is exciting for our community to bring people downtown to see what is in our community,” said Loretta Wagner, manager of Clearfield Revitalization’s Main Street program. “Ours is a quaint little town with a river running down through the middle. We have events at the Riverwalk, shops, restaurants, an art gallery and a theater.” The other stops this year include Lebanon Valley in Pennsylvania, Duchess, Southern Saratoga and Putnam counties in New York, and Amesbury, Massachusetts. “Most of the folks in the run have been to LA, New York City, all the big places, but they’re seeing what America is all about: Hometowns, not the mega cities, make this country tick,” Kenn said. A total of 26 episodes of the show will be recorded and live streamed in the United States and later televised in foreign markets (See FireballRun.com for details). The road rally – it’s not a race – and show are in their 10th season, with 4 million viewers a year, Kenn said. “It’s not your major network like ABC or Fox,” he explained. “Today, your biggest market is streaming, thanks to the millennials. They can control what it’s all about because a network might say, ‘We don’t want to talk about missing kids.'” Finding missing children A major component of the race is to help locate missing children through the Child Rescue Network, Kenn said. He said his team originally was assigned a child missing from Pittsburgh, but the child was located in April. The team now is tasked with locating Corey Edkin, last seen at the age of 2 on Oct. 12, 1986, in New Columbia. “Missing kids were on milk cartons for years,” Kenn said. Edkin “was one of those kids. It’s a challenge for us, but the positive thing is that we’re in the best time with the best opportunity ever to find a missing 32-year-old because of social media. We’re trying to get closure on it, hopefully a positive outcome.” Since its beginning in 2007, 47 children have been recovered through the run. Developing a taste Ken, the father, started making wine with his father in the 1950s, and later gained an appreciation for the German style of wine making while stationed in Europe with the U.S. Air Force. He moved to Clearfield, his wife’s hometown, in 1971, and for years ran a successful financial planning firm. In 1994, he purchased property in Curwensville and planted 12 vines. By 1998, there were 3,000 vines, including Concord, Niagara, Traminette, Foch and Leon Millot and he built a winery. It went commercial in 2005. Today, four generations of the family are involved in the business, which now includes an outlet in the Altoona Wal-Mart store. Exotic cars Kenn, the son, stumbled on an “exotic car show” where the Love Bug, the “Back to the Future” Delorean, and others were on display in Florida about five years ago. He discovered the Fireball Run and was hooked by its missing children program. “I thought that was cool,” he said. “We do charity work, supporting different organizations.” Starr Hill has been an official sponsor since. When planning for this year’s road rally began, Kenn realized his winery was in the perfect location to be a destination and signed up. His team is the first to be a corporate sponsor, a destination and participants in the rally. Said his father: “Fireball Run educates viewers while inspiring travel (and is) a fabulous way to not only showcase what Starr Hill Vineyard and Winery has to offer but to also do our part to assist in finding America’s missing children.” The Starrs, he said, also plan to get bragging rights by “winning the race to recover our missing child.” Mirror Life Writer Cherie Hicks is at 949-7030.

SHARE You Said It, August 21, 2016 By Staff Saturday, August 20, 2016 Recently I was stopped by a total stranger on my daily walk. He asked me what I thought of the bumper sticker he had placed in the lower left corner of his vehicle’s rear window. It contained an anti-Hillary message. I tried to explain to this elderly gentleman that I happened to dislike both candidates. His response was to point at me and the slogan and say, “She’s a crook!” I tried with three other attempts to find some meaning — better yet some proof — in his message. His response each time: “She’s a crook!” He was still saying “She’s a crook!” as I walked sadly away. Welcome to political discourse in 2016. Marijuana compared to alcohol has many benefits, and I do not understand why voters here accept alcoholism that has destroyed families and lives. Wise up, Mesa County, allow pot shops and have a plan intact to use the money appropriately.   A current 45 mph speed limit sign encourages eastbound Redlands traffic to increase speed from 40 mph just before heading downhill to the problematic Redlands Parkway intersection. This makes no sense. Westbound traffic is slowed to 40 mph well before the same intersection. A roundabout will force all traffic to always have to slow to 20 mph or less and cost millions. Wouldn’t slowing traffic in all four directions to 40 mph or less through the existing arrangement be a lot simpler?   The Redlands roundabout will be like 28 Road and Orchard. It will go through three or four rebuilds before they get it right. Oh well, it’s only (our) money, right?   To the anonymous, generous people who gave three “little old ladies” a lovely evening at 626 on Rood on Aug. 2, we thank you!   Did you not see my blue car or understand the stop sign? After you hit me, you thought it best to keep going. No points, no increase in insurance rates. I do hope with your next hit-and-run that no one is hurt.   Maybe before the City Council and other officials put their name on the bronze plaque for their new buildings, they should wait a while until it actually turns a profit. We have a plethora of city projects that suck taxpayer monies down the drain but they have their names in bronze. If Two Rivers sells, maybe the plaque can be moved near the treasurer’s office in City Hall to remind them that it wasn’t their money to begin with.   Reading about the two women’s abuse of a 3-year-old toddler was sickening and disturbing. Why treat a precious child so brutally?   We love reading the Tickles & Bits at our favorite restaurant, Pufferbelly, on Sunday morning. Unfortunately people have been taking them home instead of leaving them for the next people to enjoy. Please be considerate of others and leave them.    I wanted to commend the staff at Walmart on North Avenue involved in the care of a gentleman who had a serious health event. I was impressed with the quick response, the number of employees who came to the call for help, but mostly for the dignity and respect they gave to him and his companion. I was deeply impressed with them all. If I ever have a loved one who is seriously ill while out in the community, I would hope for such compassionate, professional caring people to act on their behalf. Thank you all.   I would like to thank from the bottom of my heart all of the wonderful people who came out of vehicles and houses on Aug. 8 around 5 p.m. on G Road and 26 Road to assist me and my 8-year-old and 10-year-old grandchildren when we were in a horrible car crash. I remember a woman and man who stopped the car from rolling and an off-duty EMT who by an act of God happened to be behind me. There were countless others who ran to assist and I will be eternally grateful also! COMMENTS Commenting is not available in this channel entry.

ROSENBERG AP Business Writer NEW YORK When Terina McKinney displays her leather bags and belts at events attended primarily by black women, they are often interested in her designs, and in her experience as a black business owner. But she seldom makes sales. “They all ooh and ahh and ask a ton of questions, but don’t necessarily make purchases,” says McKinney, whose Jypsea Leathergoods products range from $20 to $325. Instead, her customers tend to be white or Asian women. While calls have been increasing for black consumers to support black-owned businesses with their buying power estimated at more than $1.2 trillion a year, social media campaigns with momentum like #buyblack are relatively new. And McKinney’s frustration is shared by some other black business owners who say they can find it hard to sell to black consumers. The factors can be logistical or practical, such as being located farther away or having higher prices than big chain stories, retail experts and civic leaders say. Scarcity can be a reason: It can be hard to find businesses owned by blacks. But other considerations might be emotional, like wanting a trendy design everyone is wearing, or the perception that national brands are better. “There’s a myth that’s been placed on our communities for many generations: White people’s ice is colder. White businesses are superior to black businesses,” says Ron Busby, president of the U.S. Black Chambers, a national business organization for black-owned companies. “We have to change that mentality. We have to be better, conscientious consumers.” McKinney, who lives in Camden, N.J., outside of Philadelphia, says her lower sales to black shoppers don’t seem to be a matter of money, since she finds that many will spend on well-known labels. Designer Joede Brown has seen similar responses to her crocheted clothing, which sells under the Black Pearl Creations brand from under $30 to up to $500 for the most intricate pieces. She finds black customers sometimes say her products are too expensive, although they’ll wear a big-name brand that costs the same or more. Brown, who lives in Manchester, N.H., recognizes that a preference for well-known brands isn’t limited to the black community, but also wonders if buying them is a statement: “You’ve beaten me down, but look, I can have this, too.” Consumers who do try to focus their spending on black-owned companies say finding them requires research, and it can take more time and effort to get there. But locating options is getting far easier, both through local and national social media campaigns and online lists from groups such as the U.S. Black Chambers. “This is the only way we as a people can generate wealth, by supporting our own,” says Rebecca Briscoe of Houston. Her grandfather’s photography company was black-owned and focused on black customers from the 1940s onward because white photographers would not do business with them. “If you don’t support their business, they don’t have a business,” says Briscoe. Campaigns like #buyblack and also #bankblack, which encourages people to use black-owned financial institutions, are having an impact. The #bankblack campaign got a boost last month from rapper and activist Killer Mike, who called on people to shift their money to these banks. OneUnited Bank has gone from 50 new accounts a day to as many as 1,000, says Teri Williams, president of the financial institution that has offices in Boston, Miami and Los Angeles and also operates online. “It’s opening the community’s eyes to the many ways they’re spending their dollars,” Williams says of the campaigns. Businesses that provide a service may have more success than those that sell merchandise, says Jerome Williams, a marketing professor at Rutgers University. “Since service businesses tend to involve more people interactions, the people relationships should prove to be more important, compared to situations where the focus is primarily on the product,” he says. Small and medium-sized retailers can find it hard to compete on price and selection with giants such as Wal-Mart that can negotiate lower prices with manufacturers through their scale. And finding black retailers and service providers across a range of industries isn’t always easy, Jerome Williams says. “As a black consumer, if I wanted to buy from a black-owned merchant, there aren’t enough to satisfy my needs,” he says. The nearly 2.6 million black-owned companies in the United States account for about 9 percent of the total number of businesses in a country where 13 percent of the population is black. The 2012 census of businesses found that black-owned operations made up about 6 percent of all U.S. retailers and about 7 percent of businesses that provide food or accommodation. Financial counselor Harrine Freeman has black-owned beauty supply and clothing stores, a dollar store, shoe repair and other service providers not too far from her Washington, D.C., home. She has searched online or asked friends and neighbors to find other businesses. But other black-owned stores might be an hour’s drive away. “I’m willing to drive that far, but that’s not to say I can go there every week,” Freeman says. Many stores in traditionally black neighborhoods may also have changed hands. In parts of Los Angeles, including the once-majority black South Central area, Hispanics have replaced many of the black residents, and many black-owned businesses have closed or moved, says Joe Hicks, vice president of Community Advocates Inc. in Los Angeles. Black-owned businesses offer black consumers distinct advantages – especially if shoppers have felt discriminated against at other places – and can provide services tailored to their needs, says Geraldine Henderson, a marketing professor at Loyola University in Chicago. She cited health care providers who understand medical concerns that may be more relevant to black patients. “You want to go to a provider with cultural competence,” Henderson says.

The family, which includes seven children, also gets food stamps. A seriously ill son makes it difficult for Alcala to work. SARAH HOFFMAN/THE WORLD-HERALD David Sunderman organizes tomatoes at his stand, Sunderman Produce, at the north Omaha farmers market last week. The stand accepts SNAP benefits — food stamps — as payment. SARAH HOFFMAN/THE WORLD-HERALD The percentage of Nebraskans on food stamps fell in 2014, just like it did in the rest of the country, but that percentage started to tick higher last year and into 2016 — bucking the downward trend seen in Iowa and throughout the rest of the U.S The recession is in the rearview mirror, and the state’s unemployment rate is among the lowest in the nation, but the number of Nebraskans who rely on government assistance for groceries has been on the rise — heading in the opposite direction of Iowa and the rest of the country. People who work with poor families say they don’t expect the number of Nebraskans on food stamps to fall anytime soon: Low wages are driving the need for benefits, those people say. And better outreach is helping more people access benefits than in the past. Still, some worry whether the benefits encourage an over-reliance on government help and create a disincentive to work. Food stamp use in Nebraska — like in Iowa and elsewhere — skyrocketed after 2008 in the wake of the Great Recession. As the economy cratered, rules enacted across the U.S. to expand access to benefits also pushed usage higher: From 2008 to 2013, the number of Nebraskans who received food stamps jumped nearly 50 percent — from 120,800 to 180,000. By 2013, Nebraskans were receiving a total of $265 million in food stamps, a program funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture through the Farm Bill. The percentage of Nebraskans on food stamps — officially called SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — fell in 2014 just like it did in the rest of the country, but that percentage started to tick higher last year and into 2016 — bucking the downward trend seen in Iowa and throughout the rest of the U.S. The number of Nebraska households using food stamps was down only 3 percent this April compared with three years ago, versus an 8.4 percent decline nationwide over the same time period, according to analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. While use is subsiding, the national program is still a huge cost: Last year more than 46 million Americans got a total of $70 billion in benefits; SNAP and other smaller nutrition programs make up 80 percent of the Farm Bill, the spending package that also includes crop insurance, land conservation programs and rural development. The need for food was on view last week at the Heartland Hope Mission at 20th and U Streets in Omaha, where people one evening filled all 64 chairs while they listened to a preacher and waited their turn to push a cart down an aisle stocked with corn, peanut butter, oatmeal, garden vegetables, milk and meat. Many of the pantry recipients also receive government-funded food stamps, but with the month half over, some said the money was gone or nearly so, and they needed more to eat. At the end of the food aisle was client and food stamp recipient Paul Philamalee, who worked as a volunteer, passing out unsold deli sandwiches, whole Tyson chickens and stacks of ConAgra frozen dinners to the line of seniors, men and women, teens and toddlers. Philamalee, a 36-year-old tow truck driver, said he started using food stamps when he was unemployed last fall after an on-the-job shoulder injury. He has continued to use them even though he is working again, driving a tow truck for an Omaha service station. He works 25 to 30 hours a week at $10 an hour, and said his $190 a month in food stamps is essential. “I need the extra help,” he said. Low wages are one reason Nebraskans are still using food stamps in near-record numbers, said recipients and their advocates. Median household wages in Nebraska, adjusted for inflation, were lower in 2014, at $52,686, than they were before the recession in 2008, at $54,642, according to David Drozd, research coordinator at the Center for Public Affairs Research at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Figures from 2015 aren’t available yet. Many people using food stamps are employed, a pantry official said; federal rules require “able-bodied” adults who have no dependents to be working, in school or in job training. But working — even at Nebraska’s new $9 minimum hourly wage — doesn’t necessarily pay the bills, especially if a person’s employer doesn’t schedule them for a full 40-hour week. The percentage of Nebraskans considered poor and near-poor was higher in 2014 than before the recession, though it fell a bit in 2014 compared with 2013. In 2014, 17 percent of Nebraskans — more than 310,000 people — were considered poor or nearly poor, with incomes under 125 percent of the poverty line. That compares with 14.6 percent in 2008. For a family of four in 2014, the poverty line was set at $23,850, with the 125 percent level at $29,813. (Food stamp eligibility starts right above that threshold, at 130 percent of the poverty line, or $31,536 for a family of four in Nebraska, according to the state’s current schedule of benefits. A family of four at that income could collect a maximum benefit of $649 a month.) Continued need from working people like Philamalee is a factor, but not the only reason for Nebraskans’ still-high reliance on food stamps. Among other factors: » Food pantries and other hunger-fighting groups have increased outreach to the poor, helping them sign up for benefits. The Food Bank for the Heartland, the Omaha organization that is the largest food bank in Nebraska and Iowa, began a food stamp outreach program six years ago with the goal of helping 400 people a year sign up for benefits, said Ericka Smrcka, director of network and client services. In its fiscal year ending this past June, the group helped more than 9,000 households sign up, she said. “We didn’t even understand the need,” she said. » Changes to the state’s AccessNebraska call centers mean faster sign-up for people applying for food stamps. Federal officials warned the state in January 2015 that food stamp applications were taking too long to process. Advocates say that discouraged people from applying. The problems have now been resolved, the State Department of Health and Human Services said this month. » Nebraska’s use of food stamps didn’t expand as fast as the rest of the country’s, so it doesn’t have as far to fall. Nebraska’s peak use in 2013 was 50 percent higher than the 2006 use; nationwide, peak use in 2013 was 79 percent higher than in 2006. In 2015 relatively few Nebraskans used food stamps: one in 11 people, compared with one in seven nationwide, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington think tank. Food stamp use is expected to fall this year nationwide because many states are ending recession-era exemptions to rules that require able-bodied adults without dependents to work. Nebraska waived the work requirement starting in June 2009 and was among the first states to remove the waiver, in October 2010, due to the state’s low unemployment rate. A spokesman for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, which administers the state’s food stamp program, said the agency doesn’t make forecasts about the number of people who may need food stamps in the future. The spokesman, Russ Reno, said there are no limits on the number of people the state can serve because the money comes directly to the state from the USDA. The federal government pays half the state’s costs to administer the program and has provided some money for outreach services. Several food stamp users told The World-Herald they would like to end their reliance on the benefit but don’t envision being able to do so. Maria Alcala, 39, has seven children, including one with a serious illness. She shopped for produce Wednesday at a north Omaha farmers market, using a different federal food benefit, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC, but also gets food stamps. “I really want to go out there and work, but it’s hard for me because I have to take care of him,” she said of her ill son. She receives $710 a month in food stamp benefits and makes it last by price-matching at Walmart and making her own soup, she said. “Sometimes at the end of the month, I try to make a meal with what I have,” she said, even if her pantry remnants don’t add up to an obvious recipe. “It really helps me to have this food,” she said. “I really appreciate what they do for us.” Sometimes recipients calculate that going to work doesn’t pay, said Chelsea Salifou, executive director of the Heartland Hope Mission. Smrcka, at the food bank, said efforts to raise income requirements, so people can advance beyond entry-level pay without losing benefits, have failed in Nebraska. The rules about who can receive food stamps are set by the federal government, including rules about gross and net income limits and the amount of assets a household can hold onto while receiving food stamps. States can make some changes to these standard limits; Reno, the Nebraska HHS spokesman, said lawmakers would need to pass legislation to change the income requirement in Nebraska. The Food Bank for the Heartland’s Smrcka said efforts to do so have been unsuccessful, such as a bill — LB 330 — proposed by Nebraska Appleseed in 2013 and 2014. The bill would have raised gross income limits to 150 percent of the poverty line, from 130 percent, allowing more families to qualify. Nebraska Appleseed, a group that advocates for the poor, said at the time that more than half of other states have raised gross income guidelines above the 130 percent level. The group said the change would help people move off public assistance by allowing them to increase their income without losing benefits before they can afford it. The bill did not advance out of the Health and Human Services Committee. Doug Kagen of Omaha, president of the Nebraska Taxpayers for Freedom, attributes that to the “complexion of the Legislature” with many moderate and conservative lawmakers. He said his group has not specifically studied the expansion of Nebraska’s food stamp program but generally opposes expanding current welfare programs. While some say raising income eligibility increases incentive to work, Kagen said, “We look at it from the opposite point of view; that is, if you keep raising the eligibility benefits for government assistance, that will give people a disincentive to go out and find a job.” The libertarian think tank the Cato Institute has objected to the growing numbers of people using food stamps, arguing in 2013 that there is little evidence the food stamp program has reduced hunger or improved nutrition among low-income Americans. The group says the program breeds greater dependence on the government. The typical Nebraska food stamp recipient uses the program for 38 months, or a little over three years, the Health and Human Services spokesman said. Rachel Terbovich, 34, a mother of three, said her food stamp benefit fell from $540 a month to $160 when she went to work six days a week as a waitress at a Bellevue pizza place last year after she and her husband separated. “I am doing what I can to support my family,” she said. Terbovich, who earns $2.13 an hour plus tips, for a minimum of $9 an hour, stopped at the Food Bank for the Heartland’s mobile pantry event Wednesday in Bellevue to pick up a cart of food for herself and her children, who now rent space in her mother’s basement. The pop-up event, at a community gymnasium, served a line of more than 100 people who brought their own laundry baskets, cardboard boxes and plastic tubs to pick up food. Terbovich said she has used food stamps since her oldest child was born 14 years ago. “Once you’re on the program, Nebraska makes it really hard to get off,” she said. She said that’s because as she earns income, her food stamp and other public benefits are cut, leaving her wondering whether she is truly better off working. Asked if she thought she would one day be able to earn enough to end her reliance on the program, she said, “I will, eventually. It’s a struggle right now.” Contact the writer: 402-444-1336, barbara.soderlin@owh.com Tags Food Stamp Wage Paul Philamalee Unemployment Rate Program Department Of Health And Human Services Government Rachel Terbovich Benefit Barbara Soderlin Barbara covers food and farming from the field to the supermarket, including ConAgra Foods, Omaha Steaks, Hy-Vee, the beef industry and agribusiness topics.

The upscale, traditional steakhouse with floor-to-ceiling glass overlooking the shopping center is the latest eatery operated by Paxos Restaurants, headed by entrepreneur George Paxos.  Ryan KnellerContact ReporterValley Shopping Scene Carnivores, rejoice! The Lehigh Valley's newest upscale traditional steakhouse, Top Cut, opened Aug. 9 atop Melt at the Promenade Shops at Saucon Valley. The 170-seat restaurant offers steaks that are 100 percent USDA prime and sourced from corn-fed cattle raised in the Midwest. Cuts are hand-selected by a specialty butcher in Chicago, assuring that every steak offers superior marbling and flavor. Owner George Paxos, who also operates the Promenade Shops' Melt and Torre restaurants along with Blue grillhouse in Bethlehem Township, hoped to open a steakhouse at the shopping center sooner, but the complex had an exclusivity agreement allowing former tenant Shula's Steak House to be its only steakhouse. "At Top Cut, you are three stories high, surrounded by windows, with a brand new bar and stunning decor," Paxos said. "We have created a distinct atmosphere that matches the exquisite food."

In addition to steaks, which range in price from $45 for a 10-ounce filet mignon to $89 for a 32-ounce porterhouse, menu highlights include starters ($12-$17.50) such as Asian wagyu boneless short ribs and oysters Rockefeller; raw bar selections ($17-$58) such as chilled half lobster and spicy tuna tartar; entrees ($25-$46.50) such as Colorado lamb chops and king salmon; and sides ($7.50-$10) such as truffle salt french fries and smoked bacon mac and cheese. "Our steaks are over-the-top delicious and our seafood is of equal quality," said Paxos, noting his favorite cut to be the 22-ounce dry-aged bone-in ribeye.

UPPER SAUCON TOWNSHIP — If you're hungry for something new in dining, a steakhouse opened for business Thursday. The owner of three Lehigh Valley restaurants has opened a fourth, called Top Cut, at the Promenade Shops at Saucon Valley, according to a news release. The upscale, traditional steakhouse... (The Morning Call Staff) Renovations, which began in January, include a new kitchen, backlit coffered ceiling, floor-to-ceiling windows, porcelain and walnut flooring, and hand-blown glass sculptures on the wall. The 20-seat rectangular bar, with an epoxied eucalyptus wood top, serves a variety of unique beers, wines and cocktails. Among the dozen classically inspired cocktails, using fresh daily ingredients, are the cucumber & basil gimlet, jaded mule and Manhattanish. "It's not always what you're serving, it's how you're serving it," beverage manager Grant Parker said. "Making an old-fashioned is easy, but not overstirring it is everything." In addition to the steaks, a big draw is the restaurant's wide selection of premium wines, which are displayed in temperature-controlled glass cases. More than 5,000 bottles include top brands such as Bond, Harlan Estate, Paul Hobbs, Shafer, Staglin Family and Screaming Eagle, whose cabernet sauvignon from 2009 is being sold for $5,500 a bottle. "We have a truly impressive selection of wine that I am incredibly proud of," Paxos said. "We've focused on reds and those from Napa Valley, but we also have French, Italian, Australian and so forth." Top Cut is open for dinner 4:30-10 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday and 4:30-11 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. The bar is open until at least 11:30 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday and 12:30 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays. Info: 610-841-7100 or topcutsteak.com. Paxos is a busy man these days as he is also planning a fifth restaurant. Unfortunately, it will be a bit of drive to get there. Firepoint, expected to open in November at 3739 West Chester Pike in Newtown Square, Delaware County, will feature an exhibition kitchen and a wood-fired grill that "enhances the food, adding natural and rich flavors to an eclectic menu of fine ingredients." The 7,500-square-foot restaurant will seat 250 guests inside and an additional 150 guests on an outdoor patio. There will be two bars, a wine room and two fireplaces. Info: paxosrestaurants.com. A couple weeks ago, I reported on Villa Vita Brick Oven Pizza opening at 739 Linden St. in Bethlehem. Anthony Tsamoutalidis, the former owner of El Greco's Brick Oven Pizza at 2115 Stefko Blvd. in Bethlehem, teamed up with his father, Vasilio Tsamoutalidis, to open the new eatery. Now, the original El Greco's owner, Christine Klados, is planning to open a second location of Drake's Pizza at the former El Greco's spot by the end of September. The first Drake's, named after Klados' husband and grandsons, opened in May at 1452 Pennsylvania Ave. in Allentown (the former Pizza Hut spot). "It's like coming home," said Klados, who operated El Greco's from 1981-2007. "We were there for so long and just love the neighborhood. I can remember when [Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson] used to be a regular." In addition to running El Greco's for more than 30 years, Klados has also run a host of other area eateries, including the former Drake's Pizza Shop at Fourth and Hayes streets in south Bethlehem; the former Christina's on Freemansburg Avenue in Bethlehem Township; and the former Da Vinci's Italian Ristorante on Bath Pike in Hanover Township, Northampton County. Her daughter, Sunny, runs the 6-year-old El Greco's II in the Allentown Commons on Hanover Avenue. The second location of Drake's, which will offer about 20 seats, will feature new kitchen equipment, along with aesthetic changes such as new interior and exterior wall paint. The BYOB Drake's offers the same pizza and other Italian staples from El Greco's, along with some additions. Menu highlights include hot sandwiches ($3.95-$7.95) such as California cheesesteaks and veal cutlet parmigiano; pasta dinners ($6.95-$10.95) such as baked manicotti and stuffed shells; and homemade desserts ($2.75 each) such as cannolis and chocolate pecan coconut cake. New York-style pizza is available by the slice ($1.75) or as a pie ($7.95 for 14-inch and $10.95 for 16-inch). Toppings are extra. Weekday specials include one large pizza with one topping for $8.99 on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday; buy two gyros, get one free on Thursday; and lasagna for $6.99 on Saturday. As is the case in Allentown, delivery, party trays and takeout will be available in Bethlehem. Info: 610-419-2042. As I reported on Thursday, in the wake of Yocco's closing its 82-year-old location on Allentown's Liberty Street in May, the iconic hot dog chain is planning to open its sixth eatery by Nov. 1 at the South Mall on Lehigh Street in Salisbury Township. The 56-seat restaurant will fill a hole in an underserved area of the company, said Gary Iacocca, third-generation Yocco's owner. "We already have stores on the west side of Emmaus and on Hamilton Street in Allentown, which is only a few miles away," Iacocca said. "So, I feel that the South Mall store is going to attract people from the Mountainville area, Center Valley area and the whole east side of Emmaus and Salisbury areas. Of course, we'll also have people coming off of [Interstate 78] to find us, as is the case in Fogelsville." The new restaurant will feature interior and exterior access. It will be at the main entrance to the mall in the former Dragon Ball Restaurant space. There will be prominent signage, outdoor seating on a front patio (set to open next spring) and around eight dedicated parking spots for 10-minute restaurant pickup. Unlike the former downtown location, the new restaurant will have a fryer and will feature the company's full menu, which includes cheesesteaks, fish sandwiches and sides such as french fries, onion rings and pierogies. Iacocca also is looking to introduce bacon-centric dishes, along with a new POS register system, which would allow for the use of credit cards and gift cards. Currently, all of the locations accept cash only. "I think [the new mall owners] have some good plans for the future," Iacocca said. "And quite honestly, I think we are someone they were attracted to because of our reputation and our following." According to the South Mall's online store directory, the only other food options at the mall are A1 Japanese Steak House, Dino's Pizza-Teria, Gertrude Hawk Chocolates, Pretzel Gourmet and Starbucks. The hot dog shop's hours will be similar to other locations, which generally open around 10 a.m. and close anywhere from 9 p.m. to midnight "depending on the time of the year and day of the week," Iacocca said.

In Lower Macungie Township, the newly remodeled Wal-Mart Supercenter at 1091 Mill Creek Road hosted a grand reopening celebration Friday with samples, special guests and check presentations to local nonprofits. The remodel provides a new fresh produce experience, along with new sporting goods, home and bakery items. Customers can expect an improved customer service center with money services and Wal-Mart pickup, along with a remodeled pharmacy with a full range of products, immunizations and services. The fun continues noon to 5 p.m. Sunday with family activities. Info: walmart.com. The retail spaces of Four City Center at Seventh and Linden streets in downtown Allentown are full of activity. Rite-Aid, scheduled to open this month, has most of its shelves stocked while a yet-to-be named barbecue restaurant from the owners of Bethlehem's The Bayou and Allentown's Grain is taking shape with new red paint. The latter is scheduled to open in September in the former Shula's space. The building's newest tenant, the Blow Dry Bar by ReVive! Salon, opened Wednesday at 27 N. Seventh St. (former American Hairlines spot). Owned by Amanda Lenz, the salon supplements the business' nearly 6-year-old full-service ReVive! Hair Salon in South Whitehall Township. According to manager Nahir Centeno, the business, featuring six stations, offers blow-drys, extended blow-drys, upstyles and makeup application. For men, scalp massages are offered. Blow-drys, which cost $35 and typically take 30-40 minutes, include shampoo and conditioning, a scalp massage, individualized blow-drys (for desired look) and a hot tool treatment. "The way I describe the business to people is it's like a manicure," Lenz said. "You get a professional, longer-lasting look and you don't have to deal with all the hassle. It's a luxury treatment." The Blow Dry Bar, offering complimentary beverages and private group sessions, is presenting free blow-dry coupons to walk-in customers in celebration of its opening. Info: 610-351-1301 or revivedrybar.com. I'll finish with some welcome news for those looking to cut loose during the Allentown Fair. Maingate Nightclub at 448 N. 17th St. will reopen for the fair, Aug. 30 through Sept. 5, according to a post on the business' Facebook page. There will be live bands, DJs and no covers every night. The nightclub, which temporarily and voluntarily closed in June in an effort to resolve noise violations with the Liquor Control Board, is planning a grand reopening in October. "We hope to come back bigger and better but reality is we will have to be quieter as we work to improve our sound system focusing on quality of sound over quantity of sound along with some other overall club improvements!" owner Dominic Germano wrote. "... My love and appreciation for our clientele, employees, and entertainers never became more apparent when Maingate temporary closed. It's essentially my heart and soul."

News Sports Entertainment Obituaries Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds E-Edition log in Retailers look to high tech to engage visitors Sunday Aug 21, 2016 at 12:01 AM In 2013, the retailer to middle America’s moms opened a technology center near San Jose, Calif., with a staff of a little more than 30. Today, some 200 people work there on e-commerce, mobile applications and farther-out experiments like holographic displays using water vapor, or a “digital hanger” that, when a blouse is removed, triggers a nearby screen showing suggested coordinating items. By Rick Romell Milwaukee Journal Sentinel MILWAUKEE — The store, that basic building block of commerce, is emerging as a high-tech laboratory. All sorts of things are bubbling up — from exotica such as holograms and virtual reality to more-prosaic but potentially more-useful technology — as legacy retailers seek to merge their physical outposts with the online world. The transformation has chains making major investments, and Kohl’s Corp., headquartered in suburban Milwaukee, is no exception. In 2013, the retailer to middle America’s moms opened a technology center near San Jose, Calif., with a staff of a little more than 30. Today, some 200 people work there on e-commerce, mobile applications and farther-out experiments like holographic displays using water vapor, or a “digital hanger” that, when a blouse is removed, triggers a nearby screen showing suggested coordinating items. This sort of testing has become widespread in retail, where department stores and even big-box discounters struggle with sluggish sales and warily watch the growth of online giant Amazon. Target is evaluating inventory-taking robots, operating a showcase store for home technology, and exploring new ideas in retail through an alliance with highly regarded startup accelerator Techstars. Home-improvement chain Lowe’s is using virtual-reality equipment to help shoppers envision the results of remodeling projects. Macy’s is testing an artificial intelligence tool from IBM Watson to answer shopper’s questions, and has fitted its department stores with signal-emitting “beacons” that sense the presence of nearby customers with smartphones and can ping them with messages or offers. The quest to blend brick-and-mortar with online shopping has spawned a rash of industry buzzwords. There’s the ubiquitous “omni-channel,” and lots of talk of making shopping “seamless” and “frictionless.” Some even figuratively crunch the physical store with digital commerce and declare that retail is going “phygital.” The payoff for the many initiatives, however, remains uncertain. Much of the experimentation amounts to hunting in the dark, said Doug Stephens, founder of Toronto-based consultancy Retail Prophet. “That’s precisely it,” Stephens said. “Companies are saying we need to go to trial with beacons, or we need to go to trial with artificial intelligence, or big data. They’re starting with the answer. What they haven’t determined is, what’s the question.” ——— Take beacons. They’ve been among the most-discussed retail technologies, both for their potential to give merchants detailed data on in-store traffic patterns, and their capacity to send relevant marketing messages to the phones of shoppers as they linger in, say, the cosmetics section or the sporting goods department. That sounds promising, but there’s debate on their efficacy, and differing views on implementation. Chicago public relations firm Walker Sands says its online survey of more than 1,400 U.S. consumers early this year found that most would opt in to being tracked by beacons while shopping, given proper incentives. But industry analyst Paula Rosenblum is among the skeptics. “There remains no evidence, and I want to say no evidence, that consumers are going to accept tracking in stores,” said Rosenblum, managing partner at Retail Systems Research and a former retail technology executive. Macy’s has beacons throughout its stores. Target, which launched a test last August in 50 locations, believes the technology “has a real future,” spokesman Eddie Baeb said. But Kohl’s seems to have cooled on beacons. Not quite two years ago, amid a 22-store test, Ratnakar Lavu, then executive vice president for digital technology, said Kohl’s would roll out beacons to the rest of the chain in 2015. That didn’t happen. Instead, Kohl’s pulled its beacons out of the test stores and is re-evaluating the devices, said Lavu, now chief technology officer. He thinks beacons have strong analytic potential, showing retailers how many people visit a store, how long they stay, what they look at, and what those specific people actually buy — the same sort of data routinely mined in online commerce. But he’s less optimistic about prospects for using the tracking technology to send people offers as they shop. “I think that will just be way too much noise,” Lavu said. ——— Kohl’s is preparing to deploy mobile payment in its stores, probably this fall. The option will let customers use their phone rather than a credit card to make purchases, with their loyalty points, “Kohl’s Cash” and discounts automatically incorporated into the transaction. “Make it easy with one click,” Lavu said. Wal-Mart introduced payment by phone earlier this year. But Target, for its part, seems to have less interest. “Frankly, credit cards and debit cards are a fine and really good tool,” Baeb said. Target is, however, keen on radio frequency identification. With RFID, suppliers attach small tags or markers to products — women’s slacks, for example — that can be read by an employee walking the aisles with a detector. Thousands of items can be counted in minutes, making short work of inventory-taking. And the technology allows employees to quickly locate items for customers who bought online but are picking up at a store — a service that now accounts for 15 percent of Target’s digital sales. The retailer isn’t using RFID on all products, but is expanding its presence throughout the chain. Kohl’s, which also has launched buy-online, pick-up-in-store, is testing RFID, too. It’s all part of the inevitable starts and stops in an era of rapidly moving technological change. Some of the experimentation seems to be spurred by fear of Amazon and its remarkable growth — sales rising from $48 billion in 2011 to $107 billion last year.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michelle Singletary Columnist August 20 Follow @SingletaryM One of the most insidious scams out there involves criminals impersonating IRS officials and threatening people with arrests or lawsuits for fictitious tax debt. Fighting this type of fraud is like playing Whac-A-Mole. Just as authorities hammer down one con scheme, a new one pops up. When the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) began tracking such scams in 2013, the office was getting 9,000 to 12,000 calls a week. Now that number is 25,000 to 30,000, according to Timothy Camus, TIGTA’s deputy inspector general for investigations. It used to be that the charlatans manually dialed for victims. Now they have advanced auto-dial technology that allows them to speed through hundreds of telephone numbers. And they manipulate caller ID to make it appear as if they are calling from the IRS. TIGTA has been studying how many calls the con artists have to make before they trick someone into sending money. At the beginning of the year, it took 400 calls before they got a victim, but now it takes only about 215 calls, Camus told me. The scammers can snare 115 to 125 victims a week. In a recent week, out of 120 people who reported paying scammers, 100 did so using iTunes gift cards. But the IRS won’t call you demanding payment, and the agency would never ask you to pay your tax debt using a gift card. “We got a dreadful call from scammers with all kinds of demands and threats,” a reader, Gloria, wrote after my recent column about getting one of these calls. “It was a scary half an hour that they held us on the phone until we realized it was a fraud.” Some concerned citizens try to take on the scammers in an effort to protect other potential victims. These people, fully aware they are targets of a fraud scheme, tie up the con artists on the telephone, hoping to engage them long enough to reduce — even by one — the number of additional people they can call. It’s a laudable mission but also dangerous. “Rather than hang up, I keep leading the caller on for as long as I can,” wrote a reader from Massachusetts. “My goal is just to waste their time and frustrate them. My record is about 20 minutes before they caught on. I figure the more I can cost them the better.” Richard, a certified public accountant from California, said he fights back because he’s tired of hearing from many of his elderly clients who are panicked when they get these calls. He decided to play along when he was dialed up by an IRS impersonator. “When I balked at going to Wal-Mart and getting a debit card to pay them, [the scammer] got a little nasty, so I decided to teach him a lesson,” he said. “I have a really high-quality referee whistle. I gave him the biggest blast of the whistle that I could muster up and then hung up. Hopefully I busted his eardrum.” Steve from California, sitting one day in his lounge chair with a cup of coffee, also toyed with a scammer. In his case, it was someone claiming to be from a major tech company offering to fix his computer. He quickly realized it was a ruse and told the man he was having trouble booting up his computer. That subterfuge endured for 20 minutes. He then wasted 10 minutes more pretending to look for a password. The total time before the scammer threw in the towel: 1 hour and 10 minutes. Some readers wondered what the harm is in messing with the scammers as retaliation. “I am well aware of these scams and will not respond,” one person wrote. “I am curious as to why I shouldn’t engage them. Is there a risk?” Yes, there is. The best way to frustrate them is to hang up immediately. I know many of you are shrewd enough to suspect a scam. But some folks, the longer they listen, may be persuaded to part with some money. Camus said there have been at least three reported cases in which scammers got mad and made prank calls to local law enforcement officials claiming there was an armed dispute happening at the person’s home. This strategy of payback has a name: “SWATting” because a SWAT team is sent to investigate the call. If the scammers get your personal information, they could also target you through identity theft, Camus said. “If they get angry, who knows what else they could do behind the scenes?” he said. “They are clearly criminals, and they have the time.” It is tempting to toy with these scoundrels. But don’t put yourself at risk. Please, just hang up. Write Singletary at The Washington Post, 1301 K St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071 or singletarym@washpost.com.

And this time the company’s wounds are somewhat self-inflicted. Hain Celestial Group, which for 23 years has been the virtuous packaged food company, selling fare that doesn’t contain trans-fats, GMOs, artificial colors or high-fructose corn syrup, saw its stock get hammered last week after it announced on Aug. 15 that it will delay its annual report because of accounting issues. The company — maker of Earth’s Best baby foods, Terra chips and Health Valley products, among many other brands — said it was looking into the timing of when certain sales were booked. The news, which also included Hain saying it didn’t expect to hit 2016 sales and profit targets, knocked its shares down 30 percent this week, to $38.90 at Friday’s close. The stumble helped shine a light on its recent performance — which shows that the company may be losing its long-held edge as rivals pick off shelf space. “Hain is in a dogfight now with larger, well capitalized food companies,” said Piper Jaffray analyst Sean Naughton, who downgraded Hain to underweight from neutral last week. “We think the risks from traditional competitors and internal financial control risk make the stock difficult to own,” Naughton wrote in a note. Those traditional rivals, like Campbell Soup Co., General Mills and Hormel, have been bingeing on smaller companies producing organic and natural products and expanding their turf in supermarket food aisles. Stores are turning away from Hain’s because of price. Campbell’s recently acquired Plum Organics, a baby food and products company whose prices are lower than Hain’s Earth’s Best and Ella’s Kitchen lines. General Mills is stealing other shelf space after buying Annie’s, a line of organic cereals, pastas, snacks and yogurts.

Stock star Hain Celestial falls on accounting probe Price and increased competition has seen Costco, Walmart and Target cut back on the number of Hain items they stock, from an average of 202 in 2014 to 191 this year, according to an analysis by Piper Jaffray’s Naughton. Excluding revenues from acquisitions, its sales gains have shrunk to the low single digits from the mid-to-high single digits over the past four quarters, according to an analysis by Piper Jaffray. For decades, Hain grew alongside its No. 1 distributor, Whole Foods. But as rival food makers jumped into the sector, its sales gains at Whole Foods slowed. “Natural and organic used to be Whole Foods’ and Hain’s exclusive domain,” said Morningstar analyst Zain Akbari. Despite the headwinds, Hain remains optimistic. “We see [competition] as a validation of our business model and expect to remain an industry leader by leveraging our decades of experience,” it said in a statement.

This sentence was announced by U.S. Attorney John Parker of the Northern District of Texas.  This investigation was led by the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).  Assistance was also provided by the following agencies:  Southlake (Texas) Police Department; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI); U.S. Customs and Border Protection; Texas Department of Public Safety; Tarrant County (Texas) Sheriff’s Office; Tarrant County District Attorney’s Office; Fort Worth Police Department; and Grapevine (Texas) Police Department. Jesus Gerardo Ledezma-Campano, 32, was sentenced by Senior U.S. District Judge Terry R. Means to 20 years in federal prison.  Ledezma-Campano pleaded guilty in March 2016 to one count of interstate stalking and testified for the government at trial. Two co-defendants in this case, his father, Jesus Gerardo Ledezma-Cepeda, aka “Chuy” and “Juan Ramos,” 60, and his cousin, Jose Luis Cepeda-Cortes, 60, also Mexican citizens, were each convicted at trial in May 2016 on one count of interstate stalking and one count of conspiracy to commit murder for hire.  Each offense carries a maximum statutory penalty of life in federal prison and a $250,000 fine.  Cepeda-Cortes was also convicted on one count of tampering with documents or proceedings, which carries a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine.  Both are scheduled to be sentenced by Judge Means Sept. 22. On May 22, 2013, at 6:47 p.m., Juan Jesus Guerrero Chapa was ambushed and shot multiple times with a 9mm pistol while seated in his Range Rover that was parked at Southlake Town Square.  A Toyota Sequoia pulled up behind the Range Rover, a gunman got out of that vehicle, walked up to the Range Rover, and fired several times through the window at Mr. Chapa, who died at the scene.  Nearby, Mr. Chapa’s wife was not harmed; Ledezma-Campano admitted seeing her screaming outside the vehicle. According to evidence presented at trial and documents filed in the case, from about March 1, 2011, until May 22, 2013, the three defendants traveled in interstate and foreign commerce from Mexico to Southlake, and elsewhere, with the intent to kill, injure, harass and intimidate Mr. Chapa, and as a result of that travel, Mr. Chapa was killed.  In addition, from about May 23, 2013, until Sept. 5, 2014, Cepeda-Cortes took steps to destroy evidence on his computer related to this investigation. The defendants were acting on orders from a man in Mexico, Rodolfo Villarreal Hernandez, known as “El Gato,” or “the Cat,” who wanted Mr. Chapa killed as revenge for his father’s murder.  Over the course of the conspiracy, Ledezma-Campano and Ledezma-Cortes received money from Ledezma-Cepeda to pay for their expenses.  Ledezma-Cepeda was paid by “El Gato.” Ledezma-Cepeda asked his son, Ledezma-Campano, to assist in the search.  Ledezma-Campano used his skill with electronic devices to assist in the search, and he created email accounts for Ledezma-Cepeda and “El Gato” to communicate with each other. The defendants exchanged information via email to locate Mr. Chapa — exchanging personal information about Mr. Chapa and his family as well as information regarding vehicles associated with them and photographs of the Chapa residence in Southlake. The defendants used various means to locate and track Mr. Chapa and members of his family.  Cepeda-Cortes purchased surveillance cameras that were placed in various locations in Mr. Chapa’s neighborhood.  In addition, while in the area, the defendants purchased and rented several vehicles that allowed them to frequently change vehicles and use non-descript rental vehicles to avoid detection by Mr. Chapa and his family.  They placed automobile tracking devices not only on their own vehicles, but on vehicles owned and operated by Mr. Chapa and his relatives, including the Range Rover Mr. Chapa was in when he was murdered. After the defendants located Mr. Chapa, “El Gato” sent two assassins from Mexico to Southlake to kill him.  Ledezma-Campano met the two, whom he identified as “Clorox” and “Captain,” and concluded they were sent to kill Mr. Chapa.  One of the men was, in fact, the gunman who killed the victim on May 22, 2013, and the other drove the Toyota Sequoia. On the day of the murder, Ledezma-Campano and Ledezma-Cepeda followed the victim around Southlake.  That afternoon, while the victim’s Range Rover was parked in a Walmart parking lot, Ledezma-Campano and Ledezma-Cepeda switched the tracking device on the Range Rover. At about 6 p.m. on May 22, 2013, Mr. Chapa and his wife drove to Southlake Town Square.  Ledezma-Campano and Ledezma-Cepeda, who had been parked near Chapa’s home, followed them.  Mr. Chapa parked in his regular parking spot near a yogurt store, and Ledezma-Campano and Ledezma-Cepeda parked directly across from them and used binoculars to watch them. As they waited, Ledezma-Cepeda was in regular contact, via Blackberry Messenger, with “El Gato.”  Ledezma-Campano saw “Clorox” and “Captain” drive by in a Toyota Sequoia.  Ledezma-Campano entered a coffee shop in the Town Square; while inside, he heard a commotion outside.  He returned to Ledezma-Cepeda who told him “they shot him.” Ledezma-Campano and Ledezma-Cepeda waited several minutes as law enforcement responded before leaving the scene.  “El Gato” told both of them to stop using the tracking device they carried in their vehicle.  The next morning, they returned the rental car and drove directly into Mexico, along the way destroying the phones they had used. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Joshua Burgess and Aisha Saleem are prosecuting this case.

Credit Ruddy Roye for The New York Times Affluent and Black, and Still Trapped by Segregation Why well-off black families end up living in poorer areas than white families with similar or even lower incomes. By JOHN ELIGON and ROBERT GEBELOFFAUG. 20, 2016 MILWAUKEE — Their daughter was sick and they needed family around to help care for her, so JoAnne and Maanaan Sabir took an unexpected detour. They had spent years blowing past mileposts: earning advanced degrees and six-figure incomes, buying a 2,500-square-foot Victorian with hardwood floors. Yet here they were, both 37, moving to a corner of town pocked by empty lots, cramming into an apartment above Ms. Sabir’s mother, in the very duplex that Ms. Sabir’s grandparents had bought six decades earlier. Their new dwelling was in a part of the Lindsay Heights neighborhood where more than one in three families lives in poverty; gunshots were too often a part of the nighttime soundtrack. They planned to leave once their daughter, Ameera, was healthy. But then, reminding them of why they feel at home in communities like this one, their new neighbors started frequently checking on Ameera: Is she doing O.K.? And on their son, Taj: When’s his next basketball game? Mr. Sabir’s car stalled in the middle of the street one night, and it was the young men too often stereotyped as suspicious who helped him push it home. So many welcoming black faces like their own, they thought. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story “It felt like that’s where we should be,” Ms. Sabir said.

Privacy Policy Now, two years later, Ameera, 14, is healthy. And the Sabirs have not left. They have, in fact, only strengthened their resolve to stay after a fatal police shooting last weekend led to fiery unrest that was also fueled by frustrations over race and segregation. Rooted where they are, the Sabirs point to a broad yet little explored fact of American segregation: Affluent black families, freed from the restrictions of low income, often end up living in poor and segregated communities anyway. Advertisement Continue reading the main story It is a national phenomenon challenging the popular assumption that segregation is more about class than about race, that when black families earn more money, some ideal of post-racial integration will inevitably be reached. In fact, a New York Times analysis of 2014 census figures shows that income alone cannot explain, nor would it likely end, the segregation that has defined American cities and suburbs for generations. The choices that black families make today are inevitably constrained by a legacy of racism that prevented their ancestors from buying quality housing and then passing down wealth that might have allowed today’s generation to move into more stable communities. And even when black households try to cross color boundaries, they are not always met with open arms: Studies have shown that white people prefer to live in communities where there are fewer black people, regardless of their income. The result: Nationally, black and white families of similar incomes still live in separate worlds. In many of America’s largest metropolitan areas, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, black families making $100,000 or more are more likely to live in poorer neighborhoods than even white households making less than $25,000. This is particularly true in areas with a long history of residential segregation, like metropolitan Milwaukee.

Source: socialexplorer.com In one neighborhood on Milwaukee’s predominantly black north side, that means the appearance of a new 4,000-square-foot home owned by a black energy executive and her husband, who host political fund-raisers with valet parking. Nearby, a financial adviser and his wife are stuck in the starter home they bought about 10 years ago, because it lost value and they couldn’t sell it. Up the street, there’s an engineer, living with her family, who said she stayed in the city for its amenities and to send the message, “We didn’t want to run away.” The Sabirs share that mix of civic-minded motivation, and limitations. They are successful small-business owners with college degrees, yet even their choices have been circumscribed. The Victorian home they bought a decade ago, which they are now renting out, is in a majority black neighborhood where poverty has increased, damaging their investment. Their current neighborhood, where the duplex is, has a median household income of just $34,000 a year, or around $20,000 less than what’s typical for the region. It’s one of many ways that living around people whom they best relate to means wrestling day and night with the cumulative effects of racism. Decades of Hostility The burning cars and buildings, the people throwing rocks and bottles at police officers in riot gear — it was all happening last Saturday as Maanaan and JoAnne Sabir were settling in for the night just a few miles down the road. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The 23-year-old man who had been shot by a black officer had ignored orders to drop a gun as he fled on foot after being pulled over in his car, the police said. As his wife flicked through accounts of the raucous uprising on social media, Mr. Sabir could not help but think that the public response was years in the making. It was Milwaukee’s — America’s — history and maintenance of racist policies, through housing discrimination, divestment of black communities, and policing, all coming to a head. “You’re asking us to do the impossible, which is to tolerate a systemic demoralization of our own livelihood,” Mr. Sabir said. Continue reading the main story Photo A 4-year-old in a North Side neighborhood of Milwaukee. His mother said she was trying to educate him about violence and what it meant to be street smart. Credit Ruddy Roye for The New York Times Black families in Milwaukee have been confronting hostility for decades. Zeddie Quitman Hyler directly challenged housing segregation in 1955 when he began laying the foundation for a house on an open patch of land in the white western suburb of Wauwatosa. A postal worker and World War II veteran from rural Mississippi, Mr. Hyler was the first black man to try to build there, and his efforts were not appreciated. He returned to his construction site one day to find the frame damaged. He fixed it, but when he came back again, it had burned. So he enlisted several friends to camp out with him at the construction site one evening, rifles in hand, ready to turn away intruders. The vandals never returned, and Mr. Hyler finished building his house, which he lived in for nearly half a century until his death in 2004. While Mr. Hyler was branching out, Ms. Sabir’s grandparents found themselves falling into the familiar cycle of segregation. Migrants from the South, they spent about 10 years trying to buy a house at a time when black families were overtly steered to particular blocks. Eventually, a family member who was a real estate agent worked her connections, and they landed the duplex on the corner of North 17th Street and North Avenue in the mid-1950s. The neighborhood was evolving from one that had been flush with synagogues and restaurants selling matzo ball soup. They were caught in the middle of white flight. The census tract where Ms. Sabir’s grandparents settled was entirely white in 1950 except for the two people that the census listed as black and the six listed as “other.” By 1960, however, 2,344 black people called the area home, accounting for 65 percent of its population. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Within a few years, Milwaukee’s economy would start tanking. Tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs in the city were eliminated. Property values fell, while housing policies made it nearly impossible for black families to obtain loans and move to the suburbs, where many jobs were being relocated. That same pattern of redlining, in which banks choke off lending to minorities and minority communities, has shaped New York, Chicago and other cities, but the impact in Milwaukee proved especially severe, in part because black migrants began arriving in droves just as the economic structure that was supposed to buoy them was disappearing. The shifts ensured that no enclave for affluent black people was ever developed here. Black residents and leaders tried to fight back. In 1962, Vel Phillips, the city’s first black alderwoman, proposed a fair housing ordinance. Her colleagues voted unanimously against it four times in the 1960s.

Mr. Barnett, who came to Milwaukee in 1952 and sold life insurance, said he has seen the community change a lot, but still felt safe there. Credit Ruddy Roye for The New York Times Activists took to the streets in the summer of 1967 for 200 consecutive days of fair housing protests, and were sometimes greeted with racial slurs, eggs and rocks as they crossed the Menomonee River, via the 16th Street Viaduct, into the white South Side. The Common Council eventually ratified a fair housing law in 1968, weeks after the federal government passed its landmark measure. The racial dividing lines were already drawn, however, and barriers to black upward mobility remained. Even the neighborhood where the baseball slugger Hank Aaron moved in the late 1950s could not avoid a downward spiral. While the black population in the Rufus King area grew from 0.4 percent in 1960 to 89 percent in 1980, its median home value dropped from 9 percent above the city’s median to 23 percent below it, according to “Milwaukee: City of Neighborhoods,” a book by John Gurda. Those historic dynamics of race and housing have not disappeared, either. As recently as 2006, a city government report found that affluent, nonwhite Milwaukeeans were 2.7 times likelier to be denied home loans than white people with similar incomes. Many black people here still view the suburbs as hostile toward them. Just six years ago, the New Berlin mayor’s initial support for an affordable housing project in the nearly 93 percent white suburb was met with threats, including a sign in his yard that read, “nigger lover.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story New Berlin blocked the housing development, and was sued by the federal government, which accused the city of racial bias. Few people around here are surprised, then, that only 11.1 percent of African-Americans in the region live in the suburbs, the lowest rate of black suburbanization among the 50 largest metropolitan areas in the country, according to a soon-to-be released study by Marc V. Levine, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Milwaukee itself, which is nearly two-thirds nonwhite, has never elected a black mayor. As for Wauwatosa, the suburb that Mr. Hyler changed a generation ago, it is still 90 percent white. Where to Feel at Home? The Sabirs are trying to help their children maneuver through this complicated racial landscape. Taj and Ameera go to a Catholic private school in Milwaukee where most of the students are white, but return to a Muslim household in a neighborhood where most people look like them. Both environments present difficulties. At school, the Sabir children have heard a teacher play down slavery, and classmates stereotype black neighborhoods as bad and drug infested. On their block, where the sidewalks are cracked and some empty lots have been turned into gardens, they occasionally see drugs and fights. They often find their worldviews out of sync with those around them. When Taj was visiting a white classmate in Wauwatosa in May, the friend wanted to go outside to play with Nerf guns. But Taj recalled the police killing another black boy with a toy gun — 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland — and said that he had to be cautious about what he did outside. The police did not always have his best interests at heart, Taj explained, prompting his friend’s mother to respond that the police were good. It’s at times like those when JoAnne and Maanaan Sabir are happy that their children can come home, see the nuance of the black struggle and work to change it — as when Ameera helped petition to prevent a liquor store from opening in the neighborhood. Or when the children volunteer at a food bank down the block. Photo Children awaiting the arrival of a Salvation Army food truck, which passes through with ham sandwiches, fruit and milk.

Credit Ruddy Roye for The New York Times Still, their parents can’t help but flirt with the possibilities of another life. That’s what they were doing one evening in late June as they cruised through the plush suburbs, partaking in a semiregular ritual of soaking in the Lake Michigan mansions and manicured lawns and wondering about life there. They rolled past children riding their bicycles alone at around 9 p.m., and Ms. Sabir marveled that they could do that. Advertisement Continue reading the main story She thought back to when Taj, 12, had confronted her a few days earlier. He had asked for permission to ride his eight-speed bike around the block. Ms. Sabir could not go out to supervise him, so she said no. “Are you finally going to admit that we live in a dangerous community?” he said. Ms. Sabir pondered the question. She is trained for these moments, with a bachelor’s degree in psychology and a master’s in administrative social work, but she struggled. “We have challenges like every other community has challenges,” she told him, adding, “You’re going to have to figure out the best way to negotiate those challenges.” A Sense of Otherness Photo X’antony Brookens, seated, with his wife, Latisha Spence-Brookens and their children, X’antony Jr., above right, and Zaria, at their home in Milwaukee’s North Side. Credit Ruddy Roye for The New York Times Managing sometimes means moving on. And in Milwaukee’s circle of affluent black professionals, that sometimes means decamping for majority white areas in the city or the suburbs. That’s where Latisha Spence-Brookens and X’antony Brookens Sr. found themselves five years ago after their North Milwaukee neighborhood rapidly deteriorated during the housing crash. They rolled into their new bungalow-style rental house in the village of Whitefish Bay, a suburb perched on Lake Michigan with a population so white (90 percent) that it has earned the moniker Whitefolks Bay. And then they looked around in amazement. People were walking. Everywhere. Some strolled past the two-story homes with red, white and blue bunting on the balconies. Others strolled along the main thoroughfare with a Starbucks, a sidewalk cafe, a store selling handblown glass, and a supermarket featuring live lobster, a full-service florist and Champagne caper vinaigrette. The Milwaukee neighborhood they had left behind, which was nearly 93 percent black, wasn’t much for this kind of leisure. After they bought a two-bedroom home in 2008 for $98,000, the effects of the housing market collapse spread through the area. Homes were abandoned. Crime took over. Their son, X’antony Jr., now 18, was walking home one afternoon, toting a plastic Walmart bag with a Barbie he had just bought for his little sister, Zaria, when a man approached him with a large rock in his hand. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “Give me all your money or I’m going to bash your head in with this rock,” the man told him. X’antony Jr. hesitated. “I didn’t know what to do,” he recalled. “This was my first time being robbed.” So he offered $5 to the robber, who took it and let X’antony Jr. keep the Barbie. For X’antony Sr., 48, the last straw came when a neighbor was held up at gunpoint as she came home with her two toddlers. It was too dangerous to stay, he thought. Their home value had plummeted by some 75 percent by then. They had no equity to buy up. So they walked away from the mortgage and rented a house in Whitefish Bay for $1,450 a month, nearly one and a half times what they had been paying for the home they owned. But finally, they thought, Zaria could ride her bicycle freely. X’antony Jr. could enroll in a high-performing school district.

Credit Ruddy Roye for The New York Times Over the years, the Brookenses genuinely enjoyed their time in Whitefish Bay. Ms. Spence-Brookens, 39, worked as a college administrator and Mr. Brookens as a job counselor for food stamp recipients, and they sometimes would make it a point to get home early from work so they could spend time in the community. But it was hard to shake that feeling of otherness — especially for X’antony Sr. About a week after the family moved there, a police officer pulled him over as he rolled up in his red 1994 Mercedes-Benz to the family’s modest clapboard. He was pulled over, the officer said, because of the plastic cover over his license plate. Back in his old neighborhood, Mr. Brookens said, people often stole license plates, so the cover was for security. Here it was illegal, the officer told him. He let Mr. Brookens off with a warning, but not before asking if he lived around there. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “Yeah, this is my house right here,” Mr. Brookens told him. The stops were a routine occurrence early on — about once a week for a month and a half, Mr. Brookens said. He called it getting registered. “They’re going to keep doing that until they become comfortable with who you are and why you’re here,” said Mr. Brookens, more resigned than angry. He had more disgust, however, when he took Zaria around the block on her bicycle and a mother rushed her white children inside as they approached. Mr. Brookens and his wife also worried about Zaria’s sense of self. She always wanted to straighten her hair. She once bawled when her hair got wet in the bathtub and became frizzy. Zaria’s school friends called her their black friend. Her musical tastes gravitated toward Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift. “I thought she was getting lost,” Mr. Brookens said. That was not necessarily in the front of the Brookenses’ minds when, two years ago, a friend asked them to rent her cream-colored brick home in Milwaukee. It was surrounded by quiet bungalows and curved streets. It was bigger than their Whitefish Bay rental, and the rent was $350 cheaper. They thought of how the savings would allow them to do more of the things they like, such as travel. Although the house was in a neighborhood with a poverty rate 12 times higher and a median home value about one-third of that in their suburban neighborhood, they saw it as a place they could call home. So they returned to Milwaukee, to a different black neighborhood, joining the cluster of families like their own on the city’s north side.

Zaria, who recently turned 9, relishes seeing more children at school who look like her, and has come to embrace her blackness, going so far as to get dreadlocks. X’antony Jr. has spent the summer working for an activist organization. The Brookenses now interact more frequently with their neighbors. They host cookouts regularly in their backyard, and they have decorated their shelves with plaques reminding them: “Hope is believing” and “Faith is endless.” Faith in the Neighborhood Hope and faith, and determination, drive the Sabirs, too. That’s what brought JoAnne Sabir’s ancestors up here from Tennessee and Arkansas. It’s why Mr. Sabir, a fourth-degree black belt in karate, is constantly pushing to help the young men he sees roaming the streets — “You got that résumé?” he asks — and it’s why the family is staking its business interests just a block from their apartment. They bet on the neighborhood by opening the Juice Kitchen in October. They both work there, often rising before 6 a.m., because they want to be a beacon of black success and help prevent drugs, alcohol and poverty from consuming the community. Last Tuesday morning, after a weekend of destructive protests, Ms. Sabir posted a message on the cafe’s Facebook page, encouraging a collective black uplift. “Strategically placed on North 17th Street,” she wrote. “Strategically available to love and nurture.” Continue reading the main story Photo Maanaan Sabir served juice at his Juice Kitchen in Milwaukee.

Past the BP gas station, melted into an ashy heap. “It’s horrible,” Taj said. Past the people barbecuing on a grassy knoll. “That’s the young man’s brother over there that was killed,” Ms. Sabir said. Past a boarded-up bank. “They broke in this bank and then set it on fire,” she said. “My initial thought,” Ms. Sabir told her children, “was that on this evening, all these young people were so powerful.” But imagine, she added, if they could channel that anger in a positive direction, “if we took that power and that energy and put it toward our greater good.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Everyone in the car fell silent. Focusing on the bigger picture can be difficult. The following evening, on Wednesday night, as Mr. Sabir reclined on his front stoop, he shook his head as car after car whizzed through red lights at the corner. He mentioned a man from the neighborhood who was left in a vegetative state when an S.U.V. plowed into his car a few weeks earlier. “It aches,” Mr. Sabir said. He rolled his eyes when a car pulled up to a house across the street at about 10:30 p.m. and started honking loudly. “Every night,” Mr. Sabir said. And he just looked away when a man strolling in front of his house ditched a knife behind a parked car, only to be confronted by two police officers, with Tasers drawn, who arrested him. “Mass incarceration,” Mr. Sabir said. But just as it seemed that the burdens of living here were converging, Mr. Sabir’s phone buzzed with a reminder of why it was all worth it. The alderman representing the area where most of the past week’s vandalism had occurred wrote that his battered neighborhood could really use a Juice Kitchen. “Help us,” the alderman wrote, “be the Phoenix that rises from the ashes.” Follow John Eligon @jeligon on Twitter.

Target said on Friday it discovered last month that some 750,000 sheets and pillowcases from Welspun had been mislabeled as Egyptian cotton. Target pulled the items, sold under the Fieldcrest label, from its stores and has offered customers refunds on the products, which were made between August 2014 and July 2016. A “Big Four” accounting firm will be brought in to examine supply systems and processes, Mumbai-based Welspun said Saturday in a statement released through the Bombay Stock Exchange. “This is an issue of highest priority to us and we will take all necessary steps to address it,” the Mumbai-based textile manufacturer said in its statement. Welspun executives, including managing director Rajesh Mandawewala, will hold a conference call on Monday at 8:30 a.m. Mumbai time (11 p.m. EDT Sunday) to discuss the situation, the company said in a separate statement. Target is Welspun’s second-largest customer, behind Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Welspun makes towels, sheets, rugs and carpets for 18 of the top 30 global retailers. Other major clients include Wal-Mart Stores Inc., J.C. Penney Co. and Macy’s Inc. It also manufactures the towels for the Wimbledon tennis championships and the Rugby World Cup. Phasing Out “We have informed Welspun that, due to this conduct, we are in the process of terminating our relationship with them,” Molly Snyder, a Target spokeswoman, said on Friday. “We value the trust that our guests place in us. The Target team will continue to work closely with all vendors to help ensure that the products we offer to our guests meet or exceed their expectations.” Target said it is phasing out all of its products from Welspun, which it has used as a supplier for more than a decade, though the process will take time since some merchandise has already been shipped or paid for. The withdrawal only includes two lines of Egyptian cotton bedding, and not all of its Egyptian cotton sheets are affected. Egyptian cotton, which has a longer fiber that creates a softer thread than other cotton, often carries a higher price because shoppers consider it to be higher quality.

Tom Eblen PHOTO PROVIDED 1 of 5 i By Tom Eblen teblen@herald-leader.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story When Comair flight 5191 crashed on takeoff from Blue Grass Airport 10 years ago this week, it left a gaping hole in Lexington’s heart. But the 49 people who perished that Sunday morning — Aug. 27, 2006 — also left legacies and lessons that continue to shape this community and beyond. Here are two of them: Passion for service Pat Smith, 58, was a computer engineer who helped start what is now Versa Tech Automation LLC. But he had two passions: his family and helping people less fortunate. After Smith and his wife, Jean, sold their company in 1999, they made service their second career and enlisted their son, daughter and friends whenever they could. Working with Christ the King Catholic Church and Habitat for Humanity, Smith led a disaster relief project in Sri Lanka, built a church, library and more in Ghana and replaced storm-damaged homes in India and Mississippi. He was a member of Habitat’s international board and was on his way to a build project when he died. “We were quick to jump in and participate in whatever crazy idea he had,” daughter Jennifer Combs said. “But, since then, it has been daunting without him there to lead us.” Maybe so, but you wouldn’t know it by their accomplishments. Soon after the crash, Habitat for Humanity’s Lexington organization created a Pat Smith Endowment Fund. It reached its $1 million goal two years ago and so far has helped build or renovate 10 houses in Lexington for low-income families. Both of the Smiths’ children organized an event to raise that money. Combs started the Shamrock Shuffle 3k race. Brian Smith created what is now the Liberty Mutual Invitational golf tournament. After managing those events for several years, they turned them over to Habitat. The family has stayed involved in that organization, participating in several builds. Combs’ husband, Steve, has been on the Lexington board for a decade. The family also has stayed involved in Pat Smith’s mission work in the West African country of Ghana. After hearing a group of nuns speak at their church nearly 20 years ago, Pat and Jean Smith went to Ghana for a month to do what they could. In one village where they worked, Combs said, “They noticed there was no Catholic church. It had been in such disrepair that they had to tear it down.” A rebuilding effort was underway, but the Smiths were told it could take 30 years because the village was so poor. So they returned to Lexington and raised $42,000 through Christ the King Church and School. The church was finished two years later. Before Pat Smith’s death, the family made 15 trips to Ghana, where they helped build a library, a bread oven and a wood-working co-op. Village elders in Asasan gave Pat Smith the title “sub-chief for development” and, after his death, a monument was built to his memory. The inscription reads: “A U.S. volunteer who lived and died for this community.” Since then, Combs, 45, and her brother, 43, have each made two trips to Ghana to help build schools. Last year, they brought their oldest children with them: Combs’ son, Wyatt, and Smith’s son, Jackson, both now freshmen at Lexington Catholic High School. Next year, they plan to return with Smith’s daughter, Cassidy, and Combs’ son Lincoln as well as the older boys. “We try to teach them what Dad taught us about giving back,” Combs said. “After last summer, that’s what Wyatt talks about. He wants to go travel and do service for others. It left such an impact on them.” Seize the day Leslie Morris was a prominent Lexington attorney beginning to ease into retirement. His children were grown and he and their step-mother, Kaye Craig Morris, were on their way to an Alaska vacation the morning Comair 5191 crashed. “You grow up really fast in a lot of ways,” said Wyn Morris, his son. “You’ve been an adult, but you’re a different sort of adult all of a sudden. And you just kind of think, all right, this ain’t gonna go on forever. You’ve just got to get out there and take some chances.” Morris was working as sales manager for the University Press of Kentucky, but his father’s death rekindled an old dream of opening his own bookstore. When his mother died eight months later of lung cancer, he realized it was now or never. “I liked that job, but some of my best years had been at Joseph-Beth in its heyday,” he said. “I just thought, OK, let’s roll the dice. Let’s give this a try.” As Morris, 53, and his sister, Marion Queen, settled their father’s estate, he and his wife, Vicki Sword, ended up with his Bell Court house, which needed renovation. Morris began spending his spare time there alone, tearing out walls and cabinets and making plans for what would become The Morris Book Shop. “There was this idea of let’s keep as insanely busy as possible to keep your mind off things,” Morris said. “But it gave me direction. It was a therapy of sorts.” First on Southland Drive and later on East High Street in Chevy Chase, The Morris Book Shop became a popular Lexington institution focused on Kentucky authors. But running a profitable bookstore in the age of Amazon and Walmart has been a challenge. Last month, Morris announced he would either sell or close the store. It seems unlikely the store will close. Morris said he is in talks with four different groups interested in buying it. So many people see its cultural value. “I don’t have any regrets that it wasn’t financially successful, because I think it was successful in every other way,” he said. Morris said he is reminded of his father every day. Max, 19, the older of his two sons, has grown up to be remarkably like him. Their mannerisms and humor are the same. Leslie Morris was a huge movie buff. Max is studying film at DePaul University in Chicago. “They would have adored each other now,” he said. Morris hasn’t decided what he will do after the bookstore sells. He and his family will travel more. He will ride his two motorcycles, go up in hot air balloons and soar down zip lines. “It’s not like I’ve become some sort of crazy daredevil,” Morris said. “But there is this tendency to try new stuff and see new things, especially with family.” Morris said he is no longer afraid to take chances, because he knows that life is fleeting. Comair 5191 taught him that. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:14 Tina Portwood on her grandson's injury Pause 3:04 Student's emotional appeal to school board over athletics 1:00 Serious wreck near Forbes Road 1:13 2016 Doggie paddle 0:55 Circus performers entertain patients at Kentucky Children’s Hospital 1:02 See Lexington police body camera in action in traffic stop 0:41 Heat relief 3:33 Coroner describes scene where woman's body was found 2:15 UK student plants garden at Arbor Youth Services 0:43 Police eat free at Drake's 0:49 WKU students ride across America for Alzheimer's 0:56 Lexington Firefighter Matt Logsdon laid to rest Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Ten years later: Remembering Comair Flight 5191 On the morning of Aug. 27, 2006, Comair Flight 5191 crashed on takeoff at Lexington's Blue Grass Airport.

Taylor Anthony Griego, 23, was originally put on probation in 2015 after pleading guilty to attempted sexual conduct with a minor, after he slept with a 14-year-old girl. He was told then that if he didn’t follow the terms of probation he could face time behind bars. Griego violated probation repeatedly, mostly by testing positive for opiates nine times, said Matthew Greve, with the Gila County Attorney’s Office. Judge Gary Scales sentenced Griego to 2.5 years in prison. Griego will also be required to register as a sex offender for life. The recent sentencing swirls around sexual contact Griego had with a teen in 2013, when he was 20. At the time, the teen’s mother reported to the Payson Police Department that her daughter had slept with Griego. The teen said she had consented and Griego had not forced himself on her, according to a pre-sentence report. When police questioned him, Griego admitted to sleeping with the teen and said they had talked about it on Facebook. Griego told police then he knew it was a mistake because she was underage. “Ignorant to the law, he recognizes now the victim could not consent to a sexual relationship,” a probation officer wrote in the 2015 pre-sentence report. Griego is married and has two children. “I feel deep remorse for wronging my wife like that,” Griego wrote the court in 2015 during the original sentencing. A judge sentenced Griego then to 120 months of standard probation and 180 days in county jail. Per his probation, Griego was barred from any contact with minors, including his own children. Probation told him if he did well on probation and in sex offender therapy, he could earn the right to see his children. Before Griego was even released from the county jail, he was already in trouble. He tested positive for heroin while in custody. In September 2015, he was released and started attending sex offender therapy. At a drug screening, he tested positive for opiates again. He said he had used a pain pill while at work and another pain pill at a later date. In December 2015, he tested positive for opiates again. Griego admitted to illegally using Oxycodone. In February 2016, he tested positive for heroin and continued to abuse it for weeks. He eventually went to drug treatment. While Griego failed to stay off drugs, he was also not doing well in his sex offender therapy. Probation wrote that he continued to blame the victim, act defensive and deny responsibility for his actions. Griego continued to test positive for heroin and admitted to using several times a week. He went to treatment again, but left the program without permission and used heroin. As a sanction for his continued use, he served 45 days in jail. When he was released, he told probation he would live in his vehicle in the Walmart parking lot. Probation later found that Griego was visiting with his wife and children on a regular basis. Griego was discharged from sex offender therapy for “ongoing deception and manipulative behavior.” “He manifested a clear pattern of deceptiveness and manipulative behavior in several ways while under probation supervision, such as his denial and manipulation of drug use,” probation wrote. At sentencing August 12, Griego apologized for disobeying probation. He said he had felt sorry for himself and used that as an excuse to use drugs. Judge Scales said he had read several letters from Griego’s supporters. He said he discredited some of them because they had blamed the victim in the case.

By DealNews August 20, 2016 Save for later Saved iPhones sit on display during a preview event at the new Apple Store Williamsburg in Brooklyn, New York. Andrew Kelly/Reuters/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of If you're thinking of buying a new iPhone right now, don't do it! You could save yourself a small fortune by delaying that purchase until September, when  Apple is set to unveil the next models of its world-conquering smartphones. The iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus will almost certainly be unveiled in early September. The rumor mill has been grinding for months already, suggesting the new  iPhones might be water-resistant, have Touch ID built into the screen, feature an updated home button, and  come without a headphone jack. There's little doubt they'll sport improved cameras and faster performance, but it's best to take the rest of the rumors with a healthy pinch of salt. You always pay a premium to get the latest tech. But whatever Apple unveils this fall, last year's iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are still going to be great smartphones, and we're expecting to see a healthy discount for both. Recommended: Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz. Saying that any new device gets cheaper the longer you wait to buy it may sound like stating the obvious, but we've also been digging into our research. We'll tell you when and how far the iPhone prices will fall, so you can get an idea of whether it's really worth waiting. Test your knowledge Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz. Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/22 After the Apple Announcement, It's Cheaper to Buy Last Year's iPhones When Apple unveils a new iPhone, it generally drops the prices of the earlier models by $100. It has a tier pricing system, so the latest phone is $649 to buy outright or $199 on a two-year contract, and you can buy last year's iPhone for a one-time payment of $549 or $99 on contract. The iPhone Plus models work exactly the same way, but start at $749 to buy outright and $299 on a two-year contract. When Apple unveils a new iPhone, it generally drops the prices of the earlier models by $100. If you want to buy a new iPhone 6s or 6s Plus, whether you buy on contract or pay the full price up front, it will be $100 cheaper as soon as the next iPhone is announced. T-Mobile has disrupted the standard two-year contract model by offering any iPhone model without any money down — by simply splitting the cost of the handset across 24 months. So, you'll pay a higher monthly fee, but it will cover service and the iPhone's price tag. The other carriers have followed suit, but be careful to calculate the full price you'll pay on any deal before you pull the trigger. Older iPhones Are Cheaper Still In the past, Apple has also dropped an extra $100 off the next model down, so when the iPhone 6s was announced, the iPhone 5s was made available for no upfront fee and monthly installments totaling $450. However, the release of the iPhone SE has muddied the waters a little here. It effectively replaced the iPhone 5s and is being offered for a one-time payment of $399, or for nothing up front with an installment plan. We don't expect to see any further price drops on the iPhone SE. The question is whether the iPhone 6 will drop to $449 and be made available for nothing up front with installments, which is a definite possibility. Retailers and Carriers Offer Deeper Discounts Retailers and carriers sometimes offer aggressive discounts to try and draw in customers, but iPhones tend to hold their value very well, so you have to watch out for them. Discounts of more than $10 or so are pretty rare in the first six months; however, we saw $90 knocked off the price of the 16GB iPhone 6s at Boost Mobile and $50 off the 64GB model from  eBay sellers in February, five months after release. Discounts of more than $10 or so are pretty rare in the first six months; however, we saw $90 knocked off the price of the 16GB iPhone 6s five months after release. It was a similar story with the iPhone 6, which dropped about $40 after seven months and then fell by as much as $150 in September 2015, when the iPhone 6s was unveiled. In February of this year — 17 months after release — the iPhone 6 dropped to $380 at Boost Mobile, and by May this year it was $399 at  Walmart. Plus-Sized Deals Are Harder to Find The iPhone 6 Plus was Apple's first larger smartphone, and it took a long while before we saw any discounting. It was eight months before we saw an eBay seller offering a $90 discount, but it dropped by over $200 after around 19 months. And by May this year, it was $499 at Walmart. We haven't seen any discounts of note for the iPhone 6s Plus yet. Some eBay vendors have dropped $50 and $150 off the price of the higher-capacity 64GB and 128GB models respectively, but that's it so far. (The 128GB 6s Plus still costs a whopping $800 even at $150 off.) These discounts might be slightly bested when the iPhone 7 debuts, but we probably won't see much deeper discounts than that for quite some time. Carriers Entice Consumers With Buy One, Get One Free Deals One eye-catching iPhone 6s deal that was available just three months after release was  AT&T's buy one, get one free offer. It wasn't advertised for the iPhone 6s, though that was eligible. You had to add a second line and commit to 30 months, but it was possible to claim bill credits for the full price back after three months. (This deal is no longer available at AT&T.)  Sprint is still offering a deal like this on the iPhone 6s or the iPhone 6s Plus, if you're willing to sign up for a second line with the carrier. Deals on the iPhone 7 If you're already an iPhone owner, then you'll find some attractive deals on the new iPhone if you're willing to trade in your old handset. It's also worth seeing what you can get in the secondhand market, because iPhones hold their value better than any other smartphone.

Saudi customs seize shoes stuffed with pills Jordanian composer produces award-winning album from his ‘bedroom studio’ Home Business Jordan-EU trade deal may benefit economy and refugee crisis [8/20/2016 5:31:21 AM] AMMONNEWS - The European Union (EU) recently finalized a trade deal with Jordan, granting the Hashemite Kingdom relaxed rules of origin for 52 product groups manufactured in special economic zones. These zones—which are subject to less government regulation and taxes compared to the rest of Jordan’s economy—will be able to export made-in-Jordan products that include over 70 percent of non-local production inputs to European markets tariff-free. In exchange for these relaxed rules, factories exporting products to the EU under the deal must derive 15 percent of the labor from Syrian refugees. This rate will increase to 25 percent in the deal’s third year. Once 200,000 Syrian refugees are employed, the deal’s relaxed rules will further extend to other product groups across Jordan. According to the Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs and Minister for Industry, Trade and Supply Jawad Anani, the deal aims to attract foreign capital, boost employment, and strengthen competitiveness in Jordan. This could occur particularly by turning Jordan’s 650,000 Syrian refugees from a resource burden to an economic asset. economy is currently struggling. The Kingdom’s debt-to-GDP ratio is 90 percent and unemployment is around 15 percent with youth unemployment nearly double that. The influx of Syrian refugees has further strained the economy, increasing youth unemployment by 30 percent and growing demand for basic commodities by 40 percent. This deal could accordingly prove equally beneficial to Jordan’s society and economy. Special economic zones have often drawn significant foreign investment and infrastructure development, and easier access to European markets make those investments especially attractive. This has already led to companies like Asda, a British Walmart subsidiary, and IKEA, a Swedish home-furnishing store, signaling their interest in this opportunity. Should this deal succeed in attracting capital, Jordan could further become a leading destination for Gulf states seeking to invest their oil wealth abroad. All this could compensate the Hashemite Kingdom for economic losses resulting from instability in Syria and Iraq. New manufacturing prospects in Jordan could also improve job growth. Jordanians would have access to greater employment opportunities, especially in managerial roles. Syrians could formalize their businesses from the informal economy and replace much of the foreign labor that sends most of their remittances abroad. With steady and secure wages, a larger permanent workforce would boost consumer spending in the Jordanian economy and drive wages upward. Syrian workers and their employers would also pay work permit fees and taxes, generating needed government revenue. Yet even the deal’s successful implementation will not be a magic bullet for Jordan’s economic woes, and there are risks. It is unclear whether the strong incentives for foreign investment will be sufficient to overcome the dangers of investing and operating nearly adjacent to the turbulence in Iraq and Syria. Like many Jordanian economic projects this one also relies on foreign investment and international aid, forcing the Kingdom to focus on short-term outcomes instead of long-term, sustainable economic reform. Sustainable reform must include trimming deficit-enabling redundancies in government, gradually waning unsustainable commodity subsidies, and improving ease-of-business for small-to-medium sized Jordanian enterprises—which make up 95 percent of Jordan’s private sector yet are largely exempt from the benefits that large and multinational enterprises receive from special economic zones. *Global Risk Insights Name: *   Email:   Comment: *   Home Files Rss News Letters Submit News Contact us Search Mobile App Ammon Youtube Facebook Twitter About us IPad Application Office Games Copy Right Ammonews.net Powered by SpeedMethods.com

Read More BENGALURU: Accel Partners, one of the country's most active venture capital firms, is preparing to tap investors for a new fund for India, joining peers who have all aggressively raised money in an environment where caution is the watchword. Accel India, which is based in Bengaluru, is expected to raise $400-500 million (Rs 2,700-3,300 crore) for its fifth fund, according to four people who are aware of the plans. It will formally begin the process by October although it has initiated talks with the Limited Partners who could invest in the fund, two of them said. "They have started to gather interest already and will start raising the fund in October," one of the sources said. The talks come barely 18 months after the Silicon Valley-headquartered firm raised its fourth India fund of $305 million. Typically, Accel raises a new fund every three to four years. While the perception is that startups are generally finding it difficult to raise money, the reality is that growth capital is more difficult to come by while earlystage investments are flourishing. Several marquee venture capital firms have raised money this year, aiming to no doubt participate in the rush for early-stage deals but more importantly to reserve capital for portfolio companies that require follow-on funding. Accel, which also aggressively invested last year across dozens of seed-stage companies, is reserving a significant part of the proposed fund for follow-on deals. "They will probably keep higher reserves now given how the market is," said one of the people quoted above. NO FINAL DECISION ON CORPUS The firm is likely to raise $400 million, but has not made a final decision on the corpus yet which could go higher. If Accel raises $500 million, it will take its existing assets under management to over $1billion. This would make it one of top three venture funds in terms of assets under management for India, coming after Sequoia Capital India (close to $3 billion) and Nexus Venture Partners ($1billion). "For the latest fund, Accel will look to raise a much larger corpus than what it did with the last fund — while most of it will be deployed for early-stage investments, they are also looking to line up some funds for big late-stage bets," said one of the people mentioned above, who is directly familiar with the talks. All sources requested anonymity as the discussions are confidential and they are not authorised to speak to media. Accel did not immediately respond to emails and text messages sent by ET on Thursday. QUICK PROCESS For India affiliates of VC firms such as Accel, which has also backed companies like Facebook and Jet.com (recently acquired by Walmart for $3 billion) in Silicon Valley, fund-raising is typically a quick process with high demand from investors which include university endowments, pension funds and family offices. In India, Accel is known for its $1-million investment in 2009 in Flipkart, a company now valued at $15 billion. The VC firm has made a partial exit from this investment, and several of its other early bets such as events ticketing platform BookMyShow, Bluestone and Software as a Service (SaaS) player Freshdesk have seen significant jump in valuations. Last year, Accel India also expanded its partnership by elevating Anand Daniel and Dinesh Katiyar. Other partners include Mahendran Balachandran, Shekhar Kirani, Prashanth Prakash and Subrata Mitra. The increased corpus signals Accel's aggressive intent on doubling down on early-stage venture investments, at a time funding has moderated after reaching a record high in 2015. The value of venture deals fell to $583 million in the second quarter of 2016 from a high of $2.3 billion in the same period last year, according to an industry report by consultancy KPMG International and deal tracker CB Insights.

The upstart bicycle manufacturer is hoping to spur a revival of a made-in-America industry in the city. Credit Photograph by Ty Wright / Bloomberg via Getty In 1896, the Detroit Wheelmen opened an ornate new clubhouse, complete with an auditorium and a bowling alley. The Detroit Free Press called it “the most modern club house of any cycling organization in the west.” Its forty-thousand-dollar cost (about $1.1 million today) was paid for by the club’s four hundred and fifty members, who included John and Horace Dodge, the co-owners of Evans & Dodge Bicycle Company, one of more than three hundred U.S. manufacturers during the bike boom of the eighteen-nineties. The same year the clubhouse opened, Detroit’s first gas-powered car puttered down Woodward Avenue, with the inventor Charles Brady King at the wheel. Pedalling behind, on two wheels, was King’s protégé, Henry Ford, a former bicycle mechanic who was working on his own automobile at the time. The image presaged the shift that was about to take place in Detroit and around the country. John and Horace Dodge soon sold their shares in the bike company and began to build engines; they founded Dodge Motors a few years later. Across the city, bicycle-repair shops were converted into gas stations. Within a decade, annual bike sales tumbled from 1.2 million to a hundred and sixty thousand. By 1928, when Ford completed construction of a huge new plant in the suburb of River Rouge, America was producing four million cars a year. The industry’s success in the ensuing few decades is well known; so, too, is the shift in manufacturing to Southern states and overseas factories, a change that hollowed out the factories and jobs in Detroit. When the Rouge plant closed, in 2004, Michigan’s auto-industry workforce had already shrunk by two-thirds, and Detroit had become synonymous with urban decay. Now, an upstart manufacturer, Detroit Bikes, is hoping to spur a made-in-America revival of sorts in the city, by leapfrogging back to Detroit’s roots as a cycling town. In 2012, Zak Pashak, a thirty-six-year-old businessman from Calgary, Alberta, paid around two hundred thousand dollars for a fifty-thousand-square-foot manufacturing facility for his new company—enough space, on its own, to double American bicycle production. Pashak, the son of a magazine publisher who won a large settlement in a divorce from an oilman, parlayed his family money into successful investments in night clubs, concert promotions, and Sled Island, western Canada’s answer to South by Southwest. It wasn’t until 2010, though, when he made a run for Calgary’s City Council, that he discovered cycling. “I got really interested in transportation policy, and I just wanted to go buy a bike so I could live the way I was speaking,” he said. After finishing second in his ward, he decided to take a trip to Detroit, a place of childhood fascination, to get over the disappointment. He’d been planning only an extended visit, but, inspired by the possibilities he saw in the city, he decided he wanted to invest there. At first, his idea was to open a bar, but he had retained his fervor for urban cycling, and he thought he saw an opportunity in Detroit. Ninety-nine per cent of the eighteen million bikes sold nationwide in 2014 were imported, according to the National Bicycle Dealers Association, and the number of bikes made with mostly U.S. parts is well below half a per cent. The promise is that Detroit’s vast industrial capacity, combined with a revitalized urban-cycling movement and rising manufacturing costs overseas, could resuscitate a dead domestic industry. To grow anew, Pashak believed, the U.S. bike industry needed to shift its focus from racing and technology and concentrate on converting people to become riders. “This is potentially hundreds of millions of bike riders, if all the urban areas switch the way people get around in them,” he said. If Pashak’s optimism about the hordes of would-be cycling enthusiasts seems a bit dreamy, it was nothing compared to the difficulty of creating a real American-made cycling industry. At least seven Detroit manufacturers have been trying to restore the city’s status as a bike capital, with limited success. Pashak launched Detroit Bikes with an investment of two and a half million dollars, hiring a staff of forty people at an average wage of fifteen dollars an hour. The plan was to produce two thousand bikes in year one. He solicited a design from a custom-frame builder he met online, sourced some local chromoly steel for the frames and forks, and arranged to import the other components. One of the early challenges was the inexperience of his initial hires. “We couldn’t go down the street to some other bike factory to see how they were doing things, or hire people with any experience,” Pashak said. Still, the company’s first bike, the A-Type, an upright model with a matte-black coat, rolled off the assembly line in the summer of 2013. Mike Duggan, who was in the midst of a successful mayoral campaign, was on hand to receive the very first bike. Then, as now, civic leaders were championing the bicycle’s potential. The number of bike commuters in Detroit has quadrupled since 2000, according to data analyzed by the League of American Bicyclists, and the city, which has thirty-four registered cycling groups, has painted a hundred and seventy miles’ worth of bike lanes in the past decade (albeit largely unprotected and poorly connected ones). Duggan’s administration is also halfway to completing the Inner Circle Greenway, a thirty-mile loop connecting Detroit and three suburbs. In April, the city’s new planning director, Maurice Cox, promised that “Detroit will be America’s best city for bicycling.” Cox told me that Detroit’s affordability, high car-insurance premiums, and depopulation constitute advantages where cycling is concerned. The city’s road network was built for a population more than double its current seven hundred thousand. “We have so much space in our roads that if we came in and laid down a network of protective bike lanes, the motorists wouldn’t even notice the day after,” Cox said. Detroit Bikes jumped on these efforts. Pashak has been working with St. Clair Shores on a proposed bike lane that would connect the suburb to Detroit through Grosse Pointe Shores, while employees participate in rides and bike clubs. The company’s master builder, whose name is, fittingly, Henry Ford II, has become a minor celebrity in Detroit, appearing in Microsoft and Apple commercials online leveraging the city’s bike renaissance. He’s one of the original participants in Slow Roll, a weekly summer gathering that has attracted as many as five thousand riders. The environment could not have been more welcoming, but Detroit Bikes struggled. The A-Type was priced at seven hundred dollars—more than most locals could afford—and was perceived as an artisanal product by most retailers. The company cut its daily output from thirty bicycles to ten and laid off half its staff. By the time it released its second model, the B-Type, in 2014, it was selling a modest thousand bikes per year. Other domestic bike companies were encountering similar problems. A few, like AutoBike and Zen Bicycle Fabrication, closed after only a few years, while others have had to focus on expensive, small-batch bikes, or to compromise on sourcing materials. The similarly named Detroit Bicycle Company sells a copper-plated fixie for more than four thousand dollars, while Shinola, which markets popular “Built in Detroit” vintage cruisers for three thousand dollars, sources frames from Wisconsin and other components from overseas. Detroit Bikes’ response to its own troubles was to implement a national sales strategy, open a flagship store downtown, and expand into custom builds for corporate brands. It also recently landed an important new client: Motivate, which operates bike-share services in a dozen cities. Motivate hired the company to assemble three thousand heavy upright cruisers for the expansion of New York City’s Citi Bike program. This summer, Detroit Bikes will also begin selling the C-Type, a lighter, single-speed bike without fenders or chain guards, for six hundred dollars—on par with similar models produced by Linus, a popular California company that fabricates its bikes in China. Detroit Bikes now projects that it will sell seven thousand new bikes this year, enough that it is employing fifty people. This modest success is a long way, of course, from a wholesale revival of the domestic industry. Pashak would like to manufacture more of his bikes’ components in Michigan, and has been in discussions about making cranksets (the ring to which pedals and chains attach) locally. But the problem of scale remains: no domestic manufacturer produces bikes at the volume required to make wholly made-in-America ones affordable. However, economic forces like rising Chinese wages apply to the bicycle industry, no less than to the car and appliance manufacturers that have begun to bring jobs back from overseas. In October, 2014, a new plant opened in Manning, South Carolina, with the aim of building mass-market bikes that sell for two hundred dollars or less. The Bicycle Corporation of America factory, which is operated by Kent International, was supported by the state government, and bolstered by a sales relationship with Walmart’s two-hundred-and-fifty-billion-dollar buy-American initiative. Though the facility will only assemble the bikes, using parts imported from Shanghai and Shenzhen, the company plans to begin fabricating frames in Manning next year. With as many as three hundred thousand bikes set to be produced there in 2016, and a 2017 target of half a million, the Manning plant could increase the number of American-made bikes tenfold almost overnight. Jay Townley, an industry analyst and former executive at Schwinn Bicycles, told me that Manning could well have spillover effects. “If the low-cost producer, Kent, selling to low-end retailer, Walmart, can come up with a viable way to make money while making bikes in America, you’re going to see more and more of the manufacturing done here,” he said. Townley estimated that sales of a million bikes a year would be required to create a market for a domestic-parts industry. Recently, Pashak went to Manning to visit Kent’s C.E.O., Arnold Kamler, to pitch him on sourcing additional components in Detroit, which Pashak hoped would resurrect the domestic-parts industry. “Why do you need Chinese companies to do that?” Pashak asked Kamler. “We have the people looking for jobs who can do this very well. Not only that, but we have the factory space.” Kamler told me that he hopes that a revival of domestic-part manufacturing will happen soon. “If we can bring the costs of production in South Carolina to the same levels or lower than China, we can up our volume to two million or three million,” he said. “If this is going to grow like I hope it does, we’re going to need a better supply chain.” He did say, though, that he wants that to happen in South Carolina, and responded to Pashak’s pitch by encouraging him to move his operation south, much as car companies did decades earlier. Pashak, for his part, told me that he’s eager to collaborate with Kent, but that he’s firmly set on Detroit. “My dream,” he said, “is to build a bigger factory that’s somewhat of a tourist attraction, too. It would be cool if when people came to town one of the things they thought of was bike manufacturing.” Omar Mouallem is writer based in Edmonton, Alberta.

An attorney for several current or former employees says at least four of those lawsuits involve potential civil rights violations because they allege matters including sexual harassment and discrimination. It has been two years or more since complaints began to surface from within the Richland County Recreation Commission, and it is still not clear when any will lead to criminal charges, civil penalties, or major changes in the agency's administration.   The Richland County Recreation Commission's mission statement: "...enriching lives and connecting communities." But, some who've worked there say, it is certain Commission and board members overseeing the agency who are being enriched -- with public money. Example, says former employee Darryl Davis, free tires, oil changes and brake work performed on the personal cars of board members at the commission's fleet maintenance shop. “That shop is open on Saturdays, you know, for different friends to bring their cars by and, you know, get served with oil changes and tires put on it, et cetera, whatever they need,” Davis said. Davis also says on several occasions, he used county equipment to wax the floors at one of the board member's church. He also says he witnessed cash payments from Executive Director James Brown the 3rd to the board's chairwoman. “We met over there behind the Kentucky Fried Chicken on Garners Ferry Road, in the back parking lot there, and then another transaction took place at the old Walmart on Garners Ferry Road by that AllSouth ATM machine,” Davis said. “Well you know he said you got to feed the hands that feed you.” Davis says he considered himself close to Brown until he was demoted and then fired earlier this year. The former parks groundskeeper and custodian's claims adding to a litany of accusations that have defied efforts by critics to crack down on what they see as blatant abuses by the commission's top officers. "You've got nepotism that's taking place. Clearly you've got many members of the Brown family that are working there. You've got relatives of some of the board members that were hired,” Senator Joel Lourie said. “We have a responsibility to deliver a clean and efficient parks system to the people of Richland County. We have a responsibility to make sure the employees who work for the Recreation Commission are not working, in what I believe right now, is a culture of fear and harassment. And how anyone can want to just sit back and not scream and be frustrated is beyond me.” With Director Brown on extended leave, Lourie has been exchanging emails with Commission HR Director David Stringer after most of the county legislative delegation demanded commission financial records.  In one of those messages, Stringer says he's been told not to talk to the media "...to avoid getting misquoted." Lourie is now calling for a summit that would include board chairwoman Marie Green, the delegation's chairman and the county council.   There is also a report from the online site Quorum, and reporter Ron Aiken, who says Gamecock football legend Marcus Lattimore is "angry" about the problems at the Rec Commission, and interested in taking over as Executive Director if the job is open.

News Sports Entertainment Obituaries Cars Jobs Homes MEMBER REWARDS Classifieds Life log in S.C. parents fight onset of 'childhood Alzheimer's' in daughter Friday Aug 19, 2016 at 10:48 PM Aug 19, 2016 at 10:48 PM Eliza O'Neill was diagnosed with Sanfilippo syndrome in 2013 when she was 3½. The cruelty of the rare disease is best captured in its nickname, "childhood Alzheimer's." By Katie MettlerWashington PostWP Bloomberg For two years, there was little the O'Neills could do but watch. They watched as the body of their daughter Eliza, then 4 years old, grew with each new day, and they watched as her mind slowly reversed. They watched her favorite things — like wrestling with her big brother — fade from interest. She stopped reciting the alphabet. She no longer whispered "I love you." The "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" tune she would sing aloud soon became just "star," then nothing at all. And at home, she would dash past her parents as if they weren't there, as if she saw right through them. Her personality, just budding, began to erase. This, they knew, was only the beginning. Doctors found Eliza's disease in 2013 when she was 3½. Sanfilippo syndrome is the proper medical term, but its cruelty is best captured in its nickname, "childhood Alzheimer's." Like Eliza's case, children with the rare disease are often misdiagnosed at first because in its earliest stages, Sanfilippo looks like autism. That's what doctors first labeled Eliza's condition three years ago, but the girl's behavior made her parents, Cara and Glenn O'Neill, feel something more was wrong. An MRI revealed Eliza's enlarged head. Bones in her neck appeared shorter and flatter than they should be. The toddler was not getting better. They visited a geneticist, who ordered a special urine test. Next came the terminal diagnosis. As a pediatrician, Cara had studied Sanfilippo in school. She knew it was devastating, knew what was to come in the years ahead. In the beginning, Eliza would stop talking and then stop walking. Eventually, she would no longer be able to feed herself. Her memory would vanish, and she would develop seizures and stop sleeping at night. There would be pain. She would suffer. And then Eliza would die in her teens. "At that point, the bottom falls out of your entire world," Cara told The Washington Post, "and you have to figure out where you're going to go from there." The O'Neills, who live in Columbia, turned to Google and within weeks found a researcher at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Ohio working on an experimental gene therapy to cure the disease. Proven successful in mice, the therapy involved injecting a virus — AAV9 — into the bloodstream. The virus would act as a vehicle, carrying inside it a gene Sanfilippo patients lack. Without that gene, sugar molecules build up in the body's cells and severely damage the brain. This treatment could reverse that process. The O'Neills had found some hope. But without more funding, the gene therapy would never make it to the clinical trial phase, and never help Eliza. The researcher had been working for 15 years, aided by funding from parents of other Sanfilippo kids. "They were the pioneers," Glenn said, and the pioneers needed a fresh financial push. With no guarantee that Eliza would be selected for the trial if it got approved, the O'Neills began furiously fundraising. They established the Cure Sanfilippo Foundation and organized 5K runs and parties, a dance-a-thon, silent auction and golf tournament. They sold bracelets and baked goods. But after nearly a year of asking for money, they had raised just $200,000, and Eliza was getting worse. They turned back to Google, and leaned on the power of video virality. Glenn asked strangers to help him create a clip that would tell their story, their cause and describe their plea. Photographer Benjamin Von Wong raised his hand. Within a year, they'd made about $2 million. It was enough to fund the clinical trial, and soon Eliza was selected to participate in a sort of pretrial study. For a year, doctors observed a group of 25 Sanfilippo children, analyzing the disease's progression so later they would be able to more accurately gauge treatment success. Even then, there was no guarantee Eliza would get the treatment, and her big brother, Beckham, started asking what was taking so long. "He keeps asking when we will get the medicine for her," Glenn told the Huffington Post in 2014. "He even asked at Christmas if Santa would bring it." And so in a fit of desperation, Cara and Glenn made a radical decision: they'd place their family of four in quarantine. Keeping themselves isolated from other humans would give Eliza's the body the best shot at qualifying for the trial. If she somehow contracted AAV9 — the virus vehicle for her missing gene — Eliza's body would develop an immunity, and the therapy would be useless. Cara quit her job and Glenn worked from home. They home-schooled Beckham, and Eliza's therapists came to the house wearing masks and gloves. They thought they'd be isolated for just 100 days. Instead, it lasted 726. For two years, Cara's mother dropped groceries by their home twice a week, wiping everything down before bringing it in the house. They held at-home dance parties and taught Eliza to hold her breath in their backyard Walmart pool. Beckham video-chatted with his classmates from school. Cara and Glenn kept fundraising. Their family hiked on unpopulated trails and explored open fields. They went to the beach, just ones without other people. The kids avoided public playgrounds. "We were the crazy isolated family," Glenn joked. "We never thought we'd been doing it that long... it's a crazy thing what we did." They were, as Glenn puts it, "like E.T." "Of course," he added, "it worked out very well." In the spring of 2016, the doctors finally called, and on May 10, Eliza, now 6, became the first child in the world to receive this gene therapy treatment. When she left the hospital after a few days of recovery, the O'Neills broke their 2-year quarantine. Then, Glenn and Cara said, they immediately started thinking about the other Sanfilippo parents. "These other parents should be feeling what we're feeling," Glenn said. "Every moment there is something working against you. Every moment they're fading away from you, every moment, before your eyes." For now, the O'Neills emphasize that their future is uncertain. The have no idea if the gene therapy is working. Medically, that will take time. But as parents, they already see a calmness in Eliza, a spark that had gone missing. They treasure her occasional hugs, and revel in each new word she speaks. On Thursday, as they turned to leave the house, they prompted her with a question: "Eliza, what do we say?" Her response, simple but strong: "Open door."

Workers off-loaded tanks that will eventually serve as a temporary water filtration system. But, it's been a harsh summer leading up to this. Normally, you would find John Niemeyer starting his day at the Downtown Rescue Mission where he serves as the Food Operations Director. But, that's not the case this summer as he's lent a hand to the Food Bank of North Alabama. "Emergency response is a very important step for the mission because we're trying to grow our community outreach so that we can move past our traditional image of a homeless shelter, soup kitchen, food pantry," Niemeyer explained. Niemeyer and the Downtown Rescue Mission are doing their part to help the food bank quench the need of those impacted by the water issue. "They mentioned there was a need to get water out to Morgan and Lawrence Counties," Niemeyer said. "They didn't have a partner to help transport it." Niemeyer is using pick-up truck to provide a "pick-me-up" for those Tennessee Valley neighbors to the west. "If you're talking about those that are most in need, typically they don't have the ability to drive, and they don't have transportation to travel distances, so it's very critical to take that assistance to them as much as possible," Niemeyer said. "We were doing probably at least four a week; each trip is about 1,260 lbs. of water." Many area partners assisted the food bank by donating water packs. This kept the help flowing to those communities since June. "Kroger, Publix and Whole Foods, as well as Walmart, they have all been extraordinarily generous at providing water supplies," Kathryn Strickland, Food Bank of North Alabama Executive Director. With all this giving, Niemeyer said there is lots of receiving too. "Through service to others it helps you, and it's a gift to you," Niemeyer said. Together, the rescue mission and the food back provided more than 300,000 lbs. of water to those in Morgan and Lawrence Counties. Both of these groups are non-profit agencies.

AUGUSTINE, Fla. - The St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office is getting more help fighting crime thanks to technology. “The Community Pro-Tektor” is a digital kiosk that displays information about fugitives, cold cases and even Amber Alerts. “It's a great information tool, we get a lot of tips off of that from unsolved crimes that we have,” said St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office Cmdr. Chuck Mulligan. Mulligan said it’s funded—not by taxpayer money—but instead by a grant from the Bureau of Justice Assistance. The nearly $29,000 grant allowed for the purchase of six machines, as well as training and graphics.

There’s also one at the courthouse and at each St. Johns County field office. The goal is to get as many eyes as possible on the information displayed. According to Mulligan, the kiosk allows them to simultaneously disperse information wirelessly to specific corners of the county. “Of course you can see here we've got some hit and runs, a possible child abduction suspect, so these things can be populated on the fly,” said Mulligan. The county is testing them out for the first year. If they prove to be useful, you may see more electronic kiosks around town. © 2016 Cox Media Group.

But there’s still no word on what will happen to the big spaces it left. Kmart has the left the buildings it announced would close back in April. But there’s still no word on what will happen to the big spaces it left. Representatives of TLM Realty of New York have met with Neptune Beach officials about the empty store on Atlantic Boulevard. Mayor Harriet Pruette said they didn’t have any specific plans yet, but she got the sense that they plan to tear the building down. “He and I had a nice discussion,” she said. “I told him that if he puts those tacky looking apartments like there are on Beach Boulevard, he’s going to have a community that won’t be happy. “I told him I’d like to see mixed-use.” Officials at TLM didn’t return our calls. The Kmart is on the east of end of the shopping center, but the west end is being redone with Lucky’s Market going in where the Proctor Ace Hardware was. Its opening doesn’t appear to be far off. Meanwhile in Mandarin, the owners of the former Kmart on San Jose Boulevard aren’t talking yet, either. Randall Whitfield of Ash Properties said plans are still be finalized, but he said he hopes to be able to announce in about 30 days. MANDARIN The Church of Eleven22 paid $3.4 million for the former Lutheran church at 4911 Losco Road in Mandarin. A spokeswoman said Access Church has been leasing it for four years but wants its own church in St. Johns County. So, starting in October, Access will hold Sunday evening services in Eleven22’s church out east Baymeadows Road. That’s the former Sneakers Sports Grille that Eleven22 paid $2.48 million for last year. Its original church is in the San Pablo Family Center, a shopping center at the corner of Beach Boulevard and San Pablo Road. Eleven22 will start renovations on the Losco church in October and expects to start services there in January. The 21,169-square-foot church is on 11 acres and was built in 2004. It has about 7,000 members and holds eight weekly services at the two locations. NORMANDY Aldi has paid $1,450,000 for the former Golden Corral building at 7043 Normandy Blvd. It had submitted plans in April to but a grocery store in, but the company is still not acknowledging any plans for the site. The building last sold for $4,560,200 in 2013, but that’s when Golden Corral still occupied it. The restaurant left there last year for a new and bigger building around the corner on Memorial Park Boulevard. The discount grocery chain, one of the world’s largest, has stores in St. Augustine, Middleburg and on Southside Boulevard. Another store has been announced in a new development next to St. Johns Town Center. NORTH JAX Work began this past week on a new apartment complex in the fast-growing area near River City Marketplace. Integra Land Co. of Lake Mary paid $3,278,000 for 17.75 acres on Owens Road at Max Leggett Parkway. There it’s developing a 300-unit, four-story gated apartment complex called Integra River Run. LandSouth Construction of Jacksonville is building it. The first units are expected to be done in 11 months with completion about 16 months away. ATLANTIC BEACH Fleet Landing in Atlantic Beach is continuing to grow. As Naval Continuing Care Retirement Foundation, it recently paid $2,450,000 for almost 30 vacant acres just east of its facility off Mayport Road. Over the last four years, it’s paid a total of $5.8 million for 41.6 acres in six transactions. That includes $2.58 million for the Atlantic Beach Commons shopping center two years ago. But a spokeswoman for the non-profit senior-living community said a master plan is still being developed for all the new property. The shopping center still has two tenants, but the plan is to tear it down once their leases are up. WESTSIDE The locally owned CarbuX Car Wash is adding its fifth location at 6929 103rd St. The metal building there now will be torn down with site work to begin this fall and opening next spring. Father and son owners Jimmy and Andrew Jaffa have car washes on San Jose Boulevard in Mandarin, Beach Boulevard at the Beaches, Dunn Avenue on the Northside and Southside Boulevard. ETC. KB Home has opened Vista Pointe off Kernan Boulevard, a gated community with plans for 51 single-family homes priced from the $240s. Level Office Jax will hold its grand opening on Sept. 8 in the Groover-Stewart Building at 25 N. Market St. The Chicago-based company paid $2 million for the building in January and will offer private and co-work offices, virtual office services and meeting spaces. Express Factory Outlet has opened in St. Augustine Premium Outlets. It’s the clothing chain’s ninth store in Florida. Best Media, a division of ADI Media in Texas, has opened an office in Jacksonville with Howard Wolpoff leading it.

Stacy M. Brown, NNPA News Wire Contributor Leave a comment 42 reads  In this June 9, 2015 file photo, construction continues on The Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington.  (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik/File) Sponsorships and donations have been pouring into the new Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC), which is set to open on Sept. 24 on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Most recently, the popular 1990s R&B group En Vogue donated their performance-worn dresses to the museum. “Our dresses from the ‘Never Gonna Get It/My Lovin’ video and the ‘Giving Him Something He Can Feel’ video will be debuting in the Smithsonian African American History museum on September 24,” group member Terry Ellis said. “So, we’re really super excited about that.” NBA Icon Michael Jordan also announced this month that he was providing a $5 million gift to the museum along with his game-worn 1996 NBA Finals jersey. The museum will reportedly place the famous jersey in a wing called “Michael Jordan Hall,” that will feature stories of 17 historic athletes. In a news release, Jordan noted athletes like Jesse Owens whose “talent, commitment and perseverance broke racial barriers and laid the groundwork for the successful careers of so many African-Americans in athletics and beyond.” Also, in a statement, museum director Lonnie G. Bunch III said Jordan’s contribution will enable museum “visitors to explore how sports were used to break barriers as a way to gain full participation in American society.” The National Museum of African American History and Culture officially opens to the public following the dedication ceremony on Saturday, September 24, 2016. The museum keeps its doors open for extended hours Sunday, September 25, from 10 am to 10pm. The National Museum of African American History and Culture is the only national museum devoted exclusively to the documentation of African-American life, history, and culture. It was established by an Act of Congress in 2003, following decades of efforts to promote and highlight the contributions of African-Americans, according to the museum’s website. To date, the museum has collected more than 36,000 artifacts. Nearly 100,000 individuals have become charter members of the museum and, when it opens, it will be the 19th and newest museum of the Smithsonian Institution. Museum officials noted the four pillars upon which the NMAAHC stands: It provides an opportunity for those who are interested in African-American culture to explore and revel in this history through interactive exhibitions; It helps all Americans see how their stories, their histories, and their cultures are shaped and informed by global influences; It explores what it means to be an American and share how American values like resiliency, optimism, and spirituality are reflected in African-American history and culture; and it serves as a place of collaboration that reaches beyond Washington, D.C., to engage new audiences and to collaborate with the myriad of museums and educational institutions that have explored and preserved this important history well before this museum was created. Earlier this year, The Hartford, a popular financial services company, announced its founding sponsorship of the museum. The company made a $1 million contribution over five years to support the design and construction of the building. “The Hartford has been a part of American history for more than 200 years, growing, thriving and changing along with our nation,” said Susan Johnson, head of diversity and inclusion at The Hartford. “We are proud to be a founding sponsor of the National Museum of African American History and Culture and celebrate the important contributions of African Americans to the American Dream.” On Feb. 22, 2012, the Smithsonian broke ground on the NMAAHC at a five-acre site on Constitution Avenue between 14th and 15th streets in Northwest Washington, D.C. The 400,000-square-foot building has five levels above ground and four below. It will have exhibition galleries, an education center, a theater, café and store as well as staff offices. Pinnacle donors – those who have contributed $20 million or more – include the Lilly Endowment Inc., Robert Frederick Smith, and the Oprah Winfrey Charitable Foundation. Capstone donors – those who have contributed at least $10 million – include the Atlantic Philanthropies, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, The Rhimes Family Foundation and David M. Rubenstein. Cornerstone donors – those who have contributed at least $5 million – include 3M, American Express, The Boeing Company, Ford Foundation, GE, Robert L. Johnson, Kaiser Permanente, The Rockefeller Foundation, Target, United Health Group, and Walmart. Keystone Donors – those who have contributed at least $2 million – include 21st Century Fox and News Corp, Bank of America, The Walt Disney Company, W.K. Kellogg Foundation, Kovler Foundation, Medtronic Foundation, The Moore Charitable Foundation/Louis Moore Bacon, Stavros Niarchos Foundation, Northrop Grumman, Prudential, Smithsonian Channel, Earl W. and Amanda Stafford, Patty Stonesifer and Michael Kinsley, Time Warner Foundation, Toyota, United Technologies Corporation, Walton Family Foundation, Anthony and Beatrice Welters and the Vincent Wilkinson Foundation. Verizon, Xerox, Wells Fargo, Google, Tyler Perry, New York Life, MetLife Foundation, Fed Ex, Ford Motor Company Fund, General Motors and a host of others have donated at least $1 million, making them “milestone donors.” “After more than a decade of hard work and dedication on the part of so many, we will open the doors of the museum and let visitors see that it is a place for all people,” Bunch said in an earlier statement. Bunch continued: “We have created exhibitions and programs designed to unite and capture the attention of millions of people worldwide. It will be a place for healing and reconciliation, a place where everyone can explore the story of America through the lens of the African American experience.” The National Museum of African American History and Culture officially opens to the public following the dedication ceremony on Saturday, September 24, 2016. The museum keeps its doors open for extended hours Sunday, September 25, from 10 am to 10pm. Also On Atlanta Daily World: comments – Add Yours DIGITAL EDITION!

"He must have been suspicious to them," said Canton Police Detective Terence Wade. "They caught him following a young girl, a nine year old girl, around a store." Dodds was on probation, but this violation could him back in jail, serving out the rest of his previous sentence, plus a minimum ten years extra for spying on a minor. The Canton Police Department was not able to release Walmart's surveillance video, but Detective Wade says that Dodds was caught on the surveillance video stalking the 9-year-old girl and following her into a bathroom, where an employee saw him peeping into the stall. He later propositioned the 9-year-old, asking if she would come to the men's bathroom with him. Copyright 2016 MSNewsNow. All rights reserved.

TOBIAS NICOLAI , POLOFOTO VIA AP By PETER LARSEN / STAFF WRITER Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF PJ Harvey Where: Shrine Expo Hall, Los Angeles When: Aug. 18 Also: 9:30 p.m. Friday at the Fonda Theatre, 6126 Hollywood Blvd., Los Angeles (Tickets $35 at axs.com) Set list Main set: Chain of Keys / The Ministry of Defence / The Community of Hope / The Orange Monkey / A Line in the Sand / Let England Shake / The Words That Maketh Murder / The Glorious Land / Medicinals / When Under Ether / Dollar, Dollar / The Wheel / The Ministry of Social Affairs / 50ft Queenie / Down by the Water / To Bring You My Love / River Anacostia Encore: Near the Memorials to Vietnam and Lincoln / Working for the Man With her new album, “The Hope Six Demolition Project,” the fiercely intense PJ Harvey continued turning over the soil in that place where the political meets personal, a fertile vein for her now and on its predecessor “Let England Shake.” She’s got things to talk about, issues she’s seen around the world, though often with their roots, or tentacles, firmly planted in the United States, and at the Shrine Expo Hall on Thursday Harvey explored them, playing all 11 tracks of the new record live for a sold-out and adoring audience. Harvey has always been a mesmerizing presence in the studio and especially live, and for 19 songs and 90 minutes on Thursday she captivated the crowd almost without pause with her voice, her music, her minimal yet dramatic stage choreography. The night began with a bit of that theatricality as Harvey, playing saxophone, and the nine men in her touring group marched on stage like a battlefield band playing a mournful dirge – more saxophones squawking, snares and bass drums keeping a sharp, slow beat – before slipping into “Chain of Keys,” the first of five new tunes that opened the show. Where “Let England Shake” turned Harvey’s burning vision on her homeland in all its flaws and faded glories, “The Hope Six Demolition Project” – the album the musical accompaniment to a broader work that includes photography, poetry and a documentary film – shifts much of her focus to the United States at home and abroad. Its songs can be opaque in their meanings, but the lyrics offer hints and whispers of the things that interest her: Poverty and war, the rights of women, children and native peoples, governments at once both overbearing and uncaring. Their titles – “The Ministry of Defence,” “Near the Memorials to Vietnam and Lincoln,” “A Line In The Sand” – offer even more clues to her intent and purpose. Live at the Shrine, though, everything felt stronger and clearer, as the sharp band, which included such longtime Harvey collaborators as John Parish and Mick Harvey, breathed power and passion to amplify that for which PJ Harvey long as been lauded. “The Ministry of Defence” opened with a hard beat that lifted on the choruses, when seven of the nine men in the band sang with Harvey. “The Community of Hope” arrived with a rousing, almost cheerful melody undercut by lyrics that described a downtrodden neighborhood in Washington D.C., the song coming to a close with nearly the whole band singing the bitterly ironic line, “They’re gonna put a Wal-Mart here.” Eventually the show opened up to older, more familiar songs. “Let England Shake” found Harvey singing in the haunting falsetto she used for much of that album, her long black sleeves flowing as she moved she seemed a prophet dressed in vestments. “The Words That Maketh Murder” from the same album fit seamlessly with the new material, its final refrain quoting Eddie Cochran’s “Summertime Blues,” the band again a chorus singing the refrain: “What if I take my troubles to the United Nations?” The stage lights and backdrops also seemed to reference Harvey’s current interests, the video screen mostly displaying an image reminiscent of the brutalist architecture popular in so many mid-century government buildings, the effect making it feel like Harvey and the band were playing in the courtyard of the ministry or this or that. Unlike past tours when Harvey played guitar, autoharp and a handful of other instruments here she focused on singing and saxophone, at times as on songs such as “The Wheel,” a song about the plight of children, stepping to the back of the stage to join the two other horn players, emphasizing her role as a member of the band more than the star in the spotlight up front. A run of songs near the end of the night nicely brought the show to a rousing and harder rocking finale. The new tune “The Ministry of Social Affairs” opened with a greasy blues riff which segued nicely into “50ft Queenie” a track from her 1993 sophomore release “Rid of Me.” The punk blues of “Queenie” got a huge response from the crowd as did “Down By The Water,” one of the most eerily seductive songs she’s ever done. Band introductions represented the only time she spoke to the audience all night. In addition to Parish and Mick Harvey, standouts in the band include Alain Johannes on guitars, Terry Edwards on saxophones and flute, and Jean Marc Butty on percussion, though all were excellent. The earlier and much-loved “To Bring You My Love” with Parish playing its echoing guitar riff offered another highlight and followed by the new “River Anacostia” with its references to the spiritual “Wade In The Water” brought the main set to a close. A two-song encore closed with a riveting performance of “Working For The Man,” Harvey dancing as she sang into an old-fashioned microphone, the band roaring full-out behind her, a dazzling finish to a show I only wished had last a few songs longer.

Shyquinn Dix, 21, of Abel Avenue is being held on $535,000 bond for failure to appear on a series of charges related to an allegedly forging checks to withdraw thousands of dollars from empty bank accounts. Photo: Stamford Police Stamford man held on $500K bond for failing to appear in court 1 / 1 Back to Gallery STAMFORD — A 21-year-old city man who repeatedly failed to appear in court on forgery and other charges was tracked down last week at his girlfriend’s Bridgeport home and held over the weekend on more than $500,000 bond. Shyquinn Dix, 21, of Abel Avenue, was arrested Friday and held on $535,000 bond and was scheduled to appear in state Superior Court in Stamford on Monday morning. “The story is it is unfortunate that he is delaying the criminal justice process by not going to court on these many, many cases and is still active in the venue of crime he has been active in,” Stamford police Capt. Richard Conklin said. Dix was charged with seven counts of first-degree failure to appear, two counts of second-degree failure to appear and a single count of conspiracy to commit third-degree larceny. Dix was arrested in May with another man for using a “card cracking” method to steal money by paying people to give them their debit cards and personal identification numbers, police said. Dix and his accomplice were arrested after depositing a phony check worth $2,000 into a People’s United Bank account and then spending the money the next day at a Walmart and Stop & Shop in Norwalk before the bank realized the check was fraudulent, according to police. Dix was charged with second-degree forgery, fourth-degree larceny and conspiracy to commit forgery and larceny. martin.cassidy@scni.com, twitter.com/martincassidyst Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW Climate Concepts Women's Hooded Jacket for $10 + pickup at...

What is behind the price increase and are there cheaper alternatives to this epinephrine injector?   ( Intropin | Wikimedia Commons ) Advertisement Individuals with severe allergies often rely on the lifesaving EpiPen when they suffer from potentially fatal allergic attacks. Unfortunately, the price of the device has skyrocketed over the past few years putting a strain on the budget of families who rely on it. What Is EpiPen? EpiPen is a device used to treat severe allergic reactions that make it difficult to breathe, a potentially deadly condition known as anaphylaxis. The device is used to deliver epinephrine, a drug that can counter the effects of allergic reactions. EpiPen uses a technology that makes it easy for users to inject themselves with the drug during an emergency. The Rising Cost Of EpiPen Although epinephrine does not cost much, the self-injectable pen is relatively expensive. A two pack EpiPen now costs about $600. The device, however, was not always this costly. The price was only about $100 in 2008, but this has since increased by more than 450 percent. Mylan pharmaceutical, the company behind the product, said that EpiPen's increasing prices "reflect important product features and the value the product provides." The company also said that it has made significant improvements to the device over the past years albeit Allergy & Asthma Network medical director Purvi Parikh said that neither the device nor the medicine it uses changed in recent years. Mylan's virtual monopoly, however, could be behind the price increase as the company has strategically ensured doctors and families with allergies become familiar with its product. Pediatric allergist Robert Wood from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine said that the EpiPen brand has become like Kleenex for doctors who write prescriptions. Are There Cheaper Alternatives? While EpiPen is the leading name when it comes to allergy treatment, there are other cheaper alternatives for those who struggle with the cost of the device. EpiPen is not the only epinephrine injector available on the market. Adrenaclick (epinephrine auto-injector) offers a cheaper option. At $142 when purchased using coupon from GoodRx at Walmart and Sam's Club, this device has the same drug used by EpiPen. Some allergy sufferers have also turned to the DIY syringe method. Experts, however, warned that this method of using manual syringes and personally buying vials of epinephrine to fill them, is more complicated and patients may end up getting too much of the anti-allergy drug. Those who want to use this though may seek to be trained by a doctor or pharmacist to learn how to inject the drug quickly and accurately during an emergency.

The project in Pontotoc County will be a mill and overlay of approximately 10 miles of State Route 15, from the Chickasaw County line to State Route 41. The project in Union County will consist of the mill and overlay of approximately three miles of Highway 178, from the New Albany city limits to State Route 15. “Rehabilitation of pavement is one of our main concerns in District One,” said MDOT District One Engineer Mark Holley. “These maintenance projects will extend the life of the roadway, while also increasing the safety of the traveling public in Pontotoc and Union counties.” Construction work on both projects are expected to last until early fall. While construction is taking place, there will be alternating lane closures on State Route 15 in Pontotoc County and State Route 178 in Union County. Flagmen will be present, and motorists are encouraged to obey all advance warning signs, slow down when approaching and traveling through the work zone and avoid distractions, such as texting. The Union County project will have a nighttime work component on the section of State Route 178 that runs through downtown New Albany. “The Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) has announced updates to several major infrastructure improvement projects in the Northern Transportation District,” said Commissioner Mike Tagert. “The projects are located throughout Itawamba, Monroe, Pontotoc and Union counties in the northeastern portion of the state and will greatly improve safety and mobility in the region.” The work on State Route 15 is by far the largest and most ambitious project in this area.   ROAD WORK Other major projects in MDOT’s District One include new Highway 25 in Monroe County. Currently, crews are working on a five mile section from just south of Becker to US 278 near Walmart. MDOT anticipates these two lanes will be complete in summer 2017. There are two other sections where plans have been completed north of U.S. 278; however, due to the current lack of available funding, there is no timeline for when construction on these additional sections will begin.

As he stood in front of his house a few hours later, the sight was stunning. Lined up as if they were neatly felled on a Christmas tree farm, the trees blocked part of Peshtigo Drive SW, off Ivanrest Avenue north of 44th Street in a corridor where hundreds of trees were uprooted or snapped in half. A row of fallen trees lines Peshtigo Drive SW on Saturday, Aug. 20. Matt Vande Bunte | mvandebu@mlive.com  "It's going to look a lot different," Kehr said. "You could hardly see. It was a torrential downpour. It was a very loud noise for a few minutes, continuous, too. "We have a pool in the back and it put most of my pool furniture in there." A tree out front of Kehr's house is leaning just a bit, while farther down the street another massive pine and a neighboring Maple lay horizontal, skirting the edge of a house. Some roofs are missing shingles, while other properties appear completely unaffected. "It's amazing that none of these have trees on houses," said Marcy Adams, strolling down the sidewalk Saturday night as a steady flow of gawkers toured the neighborhood. "It could have been so much worse. That line of trees could have taken out that whole house. "It's crazy. It must have just come right through like a little alley." Tornadoes tear through West Michigan: what you need to know A strong thunderstorm that spawned tornadoes in West Michigan on Saturday, Aug. 20, left nearly 25,000 without power, took down countless trees and caused damage to some houses, fences and vehicles. No serious injuries were reported in the immediate aftermath of the storm. The storm appears to have hit hardest locally near Byron Center Avenue SW and 36th Street, Ivanrest Avenue and 52nd Street SW. Kent County Sheriff's Department set up its mobile-command center at Byron Center Avenue and 36th while Grandville and Kentwood police helped out. Trees are down all over the area, and police have blocked off streets obstructed by the wreckage. The row of trees shielding 56th Street SW from the driving range at Maple Hill Golf Course has been thinned significantly, for example, No injuries have been reported, Mayor Jack Poll said. "There's just a lot of big trees down," he said. "It's amazing the number of trees down." Wyoming suffered a tornado two years ago near Ideal Park, which lost an estimated 98 percent of its trees. The toll appears to be less damaging from this storm, though Pinery Park sustained heavy losses. The city will keep its yard waste site on Burlingame Avenue, north of 28th Street, open 24 hours through the weekend for residents to bring tree branches. Residents also can put the debris between the sidewalk and the street and call the public works department for pickup next week, Poll said. Grand Rapids also will open its yard waste site to city residents on Sunday, when it is normally closed. The free drop-off site at 2001 Butterworth St. SW will operate 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. In a neighborhood off Byron Center Avenue, south of 44th Street, where a towering tree now lays uprooted at the corner of Ancient Drive and Valleyridge Avenue, tree cutters were handing out business cards and prospecting for business. "I'm not going to be out (of work) til late tomorrow," Jesse Pfeifer said, stopping by a home where a front yard tree lost several branches. "I'm looking at, like, six trees already. I know I'm going to be busy tomorrow." The Graves family wasn't home when the tree in their front yard got trimmed by the storm. Michael Graves came home first to a driveway littered with debris, while Jennifer Graves was sequestered in the Walmart store near I-196 in Grandville where lights flickered as tornado sirens blared. "I was trying to text him while I was in the store (to make sure everybody was okay)," she said. "(When I found out they were safe) I'm like, 'OK, I'm going to go shopping.' He's, like, 'OK, we're going to go to Oz.'" "The house is fine, thank God," Michael Graves said. "It's just a matter of cleanup, cutting it down into small pieces and getting it cleaned up."

It allowed Lego to manufacture sets based on the movies, with instructions showing builders how to turn 2,000 tiny plastic bricks into the Death Star. Fourteen years later the Walt Disney Company bought Lucasfilm for $4 billion, with the licensing deal still very much in place. Countless Lego products tied in with the franchise followed, and the Lego Group went on to manufacture sets based on other popular movie franchises, such as "Harry Potter" and "The Avengers." Licensing is part of an overall strategy that's made the Lego Group wildly successful. According to its 2015 annual report, Lego Group made $1.4 billion in net profit, more than double what it made just four years earlier. But while this is good news for Lego, it's created a tough situation for some consumers. Jay Directo | AFP | Getty Images The Lego Group still creates sets priced well within the modest reach of a child's allowance, but parents who have taken their kids to the toy store know perfectly well that there is no appetite for a 30-piece set that can be built in five minutes. Kids want one of the high-end sets with thousands of pieces, and those can retail for hundreds of dollars. If that were a one-time expense, parents might be willing to make an exception, but it rarely is. Often, the child will just want another set seconds after finishing the last one and putting it on the shelf to be forever ignored. If the parent relents and buys another such set in the same month, the expense can become equal to that of a car lease payment. Luckily, parents of Lego-obsessed youngsters can breathe a sigh of relief. Netbricks, a company based in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, offers the opportunity to rent Lego sets for a monthly fee. There are several tiers, such as the Master plan, which allows 60-day rentals of $400 worth of Lego sets for $49 a month. At the end of the 60-day period, the sets are shipped back free of charge and new sets are shipped to the subscriber. Company president Rick Weil founded it after experiencing the same thing that so many other parents do. In other words, he was hemorrhaging money on Legos for his kids and wondered if there was a way to slow the bleeding. "It seemed like a problem that a lot of people had," he said. "I figured if there's a big enough problem, then there's probably a market there. … Licensing adds a fair amount to the price of a set, and the expense of the product lent itself to the rental business." Netbricks started selling to the public in 2015 and at launch a Groupon promotion led to an initial enroll of 5,000 people, far outpacing expectations. He said that requests for the now-discontinued Death Star set accounted for fully 12 percent of his initial customer requests, with the $240 Tower Bridge set taking second place. "These are people who buy at a lower price point," he said. "Something like the Death Star is a once-a-year purchase for these families." (Pictured: The world-famous Tower Bridge features iconic towers, working drawbridge and a red double-decker bus. It also includes 4,295 pieces and costs $240.) Netbricks currently employs eight people, including Weil. Each employee has a dedicated job, right down to the person who does the all-important cleaning of the returned sets, using a medical-grade technique that's absolutely necessary for anyone who considers the term "used Legos." Weil said that parents are actually far less concerned about cooties than they are about penalty fees for lost pieces. Netbricks assesses no charge for those. "Part of our service is no charge for normal piece loss," Weil said, citing a range of 15 to 20 lost pieces for regular sets or 20 to 30 for larger ones. He added that the company's real concern is the malicious actor who "harvests" Lego sets with the intention of selling rare pieces to desperate builders who need that special brick to finish their creation. Weil would not disclose his company's financial information, but he said that it's profitable on a gross margin basis, and he expects it to be cash-flow positive in six months' time. He added that he's in no rush to see the company get ahead of itself by expanding too quickly. "We made a decision early on that although there's more demand out there that we can get, we didn't want to take on a huge volume of customers until operations are ready to scale," he said. "If you don't have customer service and structure where you can field all calls, that's not a great way to grow a business." Netbricks currently boasts 215 "fully active" members, which it defines as members who have rented and returned sets for more than one cycle. The current total is well below the 5,000 customers who signed up at launch, but Weil said that was to be expected because of the one-time impact of the Groupon promotion. The lower number of repeat customers is a more accurate reflection of Lego diehards. And Weil said that Netbricks has been successful in retaining repeat customers, so they must be doing something right. Netbricks is not allowed to buy Legos from Lego.com, because Lego is trying to discourage resellers. Netbricks buys its entire inventory from retailers (Walmart, Target, Toys-R-Us, etc.). "Lego is aware of what we're doing and we've had a handful of communications with them," Weil said. "It was nothing atypical of how a top five worldwide brand would work to protect their brand and trademark. Anytime anybody pops up and is using the word 'Lego' in a commercial sense, the Lego company sends out information and notification as to how they would like you to use their trademarks, and that's been the extent of our business to business communication with Lego." Lego Group could not provide a comment by press time. "We're focused on providing an experience for big-time Lego fans. We have a lot of respect for the Lego company and their retail model," Weil said. — By Daniel Bukszpan, special to CNBC.com SHOW COMMENTS Please add a username to view or add comments Public Username for Commenting JOIN THE DISCUSSION To learn more about how we use your information, please read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

 Amazon expands warehouses in the UK BI Intelligence Aug. 20, 2016, 1:30 AM 1,057 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also GrubHub adds new features to boost volume US e-commerce market maintains healthy growth Amazon opens Prime shipping to all merchants This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "E-Commerce Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Amazon is set to open its 13th fulfillment center in the UK at Tilbury, Essex (England), according to Internet Retailer. The new fulfillment center will utilize Amazon Robotics technology, which has been shown to decrease the amount of time it takes to process orders. In addition, the technology will reduce the amount of space needed to warehouse goods. The fulfillment center is scheduled to open in 2017 and will employ roughly 1,500 people, bringing the total number of Amazon UK employees to 15,500. The new fulfillment center will allow Amazon to expand its product selection through its Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) service. Third-party sellers on Amazon can elect to fulfill their orders through FBA, which means that Amazon will store their products in one of several Amazon fulfillment centers and will then pick, pack, ship, and provide customer service for the respective products once an order is placed. Through the implementation of Amazon Robotics, the new fulfillment center will be able to store 50% more items per square foot. Opening a new fulfillment center could pave the way for more third-party sellers to participate on its online marketplace. With its latest fulfillment center, Amazon has the potential to store additional products for not only existing third-party merchants, but also for new entrants. However, the recent rise of Amazon third-party sellers has led to a price war among sellers, forcing them to lower prices in order to maintain sales. Amazon’s third-party merchants may look to smaller online marketplaces, such as Etsy, to stay competitive. This could have negative repercussions, though, given the immense number of online shoppers who currently use Amazon. The parcel delivery industry — a segment of the shipping sector that deals with the transportation of packages to consumers — is booming thanks to e-commerce growth, and players outside the industry want a piece of the pie.  Evan Bakker, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on the future of shipping that looks at efforts by Amazon, Alibaba, and Walmart to handle more of their own shipping and concludes that big retailers are well positioned to disrupt the parcel industry. Here are some of the key points from the report:  Transportation and logistics could be the next billion dollar opportunity for e-commerce companies. The global shipping market, including ocean, air, and truck freight, is a $2.1 trillion market, according to World Bank, Boeing, and Golden Valley Co. There is much at stake for legacy shipping companies, which have seen a boom in parcel delivery as e-commerce spending has risen. Twenty different partners currently share the duties of shipping Amazon's 600 million packages a year, with FedEx, USPS, and UPS moving the most. Amazon, Alibaba, and Walmart have so far focused on building out their last-mile delivery and logistics services but are increasingly going after the middle- and first-mile of the shipping chain.  Amazon has already made major moves across each stage of the shipping journey. It launched same-day delivery service, which it handles through its own fleet of carriers, cutting out any third-party shippers. The company also recently began establishing shipping routes between China and North America. Walmart's interest in expanding its transportation and logistics operations is almost purely related to cost-savings. It's begun leasing shipping containers to transport manufactured goods from China and is making greater use of lockers and in-store pickup options to cut down on delivery costs. Alibaba has begun leasing containers on ships, similar to Amazon's Dragon Boat initiative. This means that Alibaba Logistics can now facilitate first-mile shipping for third-party merchants on its marketplace. In full, the report: Sizes the market for the shipping industry.

By Jason Strongin  /  Bloomberg Cows graze in a pasture at a dairy farm operated by Van Diemen’s Land Co in Woolnorth, Tasmania, Australia, on May 30. Photo: Bloomberg The hamburgers and cheese that come from US cattle may be favorite fare at many summer cookouts, but the methane the same cows produce is significantly less appetizing. That is especially the case for sustainable investors looking for a low-emission place to park their cash. “Enteric fermentation,” or livestock’s digestive process, accounts for 22 percent of all US methane emissions, and the manure they produce makes up 8 percent more, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). And although agriculture is a growing industry as the world looks to feed its swelling population, some investors are reluctant to support a sector with such a hefty methane footprint. “There are a lot of factors or buckets that go into agricultural emissions, but livestock tends to be one of the largest focuses,” said David Nicola, portfolio manager of the Gratitude Railroad Farmland Fund, which launched this week and is targeting US$40 million in capital commitments focused on regenerative agriculture. It is also an issue for Michael Landymore, a senior portfolio manager at Impax Asset Management responsible for the firm’s food and agriculture strategy. “We tend not to invest in companies that are solely focused on growing livestock,” he said in an interview on Wednesday. EMISSIONS ISSURES Methane, like carbon, is a greenhouse gas, but methane’s global warming impact per molecule is 25 times greater than carbon’s, according to the EPA. In June, scientists from the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research found that the agricultural sector must reduce non-carbon dioxide emissions by 1 gigatonne per year by 2030 if it is going to help meet the 2°C limit on increases in global temperature required by last year’s UN climate agreement in Paris. Almost 130 countries that arrived in the French capital last year to agree on emissions reductions included agriculture in climate change mitigation targets, according to the group. However, while many agree lower emissions are an important goal for the livestock industry, just how they get there is still up for debate. It does not help that there is not even a uniform way to measure cow-produced emissions. For meat producers, “monitoring greenhouse gas emissions from cattle is challenging as there are more than 700,000 cow-calf stocker ranches in the US” beef supply chain, Cargill Inc spokesman Michael Martin said in an e-mail. Isolating the impact of direct livestock emissions versus indirect emissions such as fertilizer, crop production and transport for animal feed is also a challenge, companies and investors say. “The issue for agriculture is identifying the actors and creating levers for change,” Cynthia Simon, senior manager of investor initiatives at CDP, a not-for-profit focused on corporate carbon and water measurement, said in an e-mail. Some big producers are banding together to try to tackle the issue. The US Roundtable for Sustainable Beef, which includes companies such as McDonald’s Corp, Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Tyson Foods Inc, JBS USA Holdings Inc and Cargill, last year launched with the aim of finding better ways to measure the environmental impact of cattle. Greenhouse gas emissions is one of its six “high priority” indicators for sustainability, but “it is a challenge to align the entire value chain,” to get emissions measurements, roundtable chair John Butler said in an interview. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1427 times.

Members collected donations and spent about $1,100 on pencils, erasers, folders, glue, rulers and various items, said Jerry Martin, first vice president for the Sons of the American Legion. He and others gathered from 8 to 10 a.m. Saturday at the Sauk Trail Post 246, 439 E. Prospect St., to distribute the items "Thank you all very much," a woman said as she left the post with a backpack. Organizers also took some supplies to the Jackson Interfaith Shelter for children who are staying there and did not have transportation to Prospect Street. The group secured donations from various businesses or organizations, including Melling Tool Co., the United Steelworkers, Wal-Mart and South Side Super Deli. Students in Jackson are preparing for the first day of school. Jackson Public Schools begins classes on Wednesday.

To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Amazon is set to open its 13th fulfillment center in the UK at Tilbury, Essex (England), according to Internet Retailer. The new fulfillment center will utilize Amazon Robotics technology, which has been shown to decrease the amount of time it takes to process orders. In addition, the technology will reduce the amount of space needed to warehouse goods. The fulfillment center is scheduled to open in 2017 and will employ roughly 1,500 people, bringing the total number of Amazon UK employees to 15,500. The new fulfillment center will allow Amazon to expand its product selection through its Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) service. Third-party sellers on Amazon can elect to fulfill their orders through FBA, which means that Amazon will store their products in one of several Amazon fulfillment centers and will then pick, pack, ship, and provide customer service for the respective products once an order is placed. Through the implementation of Amazon Robotics, the new fulfillment center will be able to store 50% more items per square foot. Opening a new fulfillment center could pave the way for more third-party sellers to participate on its online marketplace. With its latest fulfillment center, Amazon has the potential to store additional products for not only existing third-party merchants, but also for new entrants. However, the recent rise of Amazon third-party sellers has led to a price war among sellers, forcing them to lower prices in order to maintain sales. Amazon’s third-party merchants may look to smaller online marketplaces, such as Etsy, to stay competitive. This could have negative repercussions, though, given the immense number of online shoppers who currently use Amazon. The parcel delivery industry — a segment of the shipping sector that deals with the transportation of packages to consumers — is booming thanks to e-commerce growth, and players outside the industry want a piece of the pie.  Evan Bakker, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on the future of shipping that looks at efforts by Amazon, Alibaba, and Walmart to handle more of their own shipping and concludes that big retailers are well positioned to disrupt the parcel industry. Here are some of the key points from the report:  Transportation and logistics could be the next billion dollar opportunity for e-commerce companies. The global shipping market, including ocean, air, and truck freight, is a $2.1 trillion market, according to World Bank, Boeing, and Golden Valley Co. There is much at stake for legacy shipping companies, which have seen a boom in parcel delivery as e-commerce spending has risen. Twenty different partners currently share the duties of shipping Amazon's 600 million packages a year, with FedEx, USPS, and UPS moving the most. Amazon, Alibaba, and Walmart have so far focused on building out their last-mile delivery and logistics services but are increasingly going after the middle- and first-mile of the shipping chain.  Amazon has already made major moves across each stage of the shipping journey. It launched same-day delivery service, which it handles through its own fleet of carriers, cutting out any third-party shippers. The company also recently began establishing shipping routes between China and North America. Walmart's interest in expanding its transportation and logistics operations is almost purely related to cost-savings. It's begun leasing shipping containers to transport manufactured goods from China and is making greater use of lockers and in-store pickup options to cut down on delivery costs. Alibaba has begun leasing containers on ships, similar to Amazon's Dragon Boat initiative. This means that Alibaba Logistics can now facilitate first-mile shipping for third-party merchants on its marketplace. In full, the report: Sizes the market for the shipping industry.
