Skip to content Satellite Press Releases pr @ satprnews.com Wrangler®, George Strait Concert Live Stream Generates More Than 14 Million Impressions GREENSBORO, N.C.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Wrangler teamed up with country music icon George Strait to bring fans his first-ever live-streamed performance from Texas’ historic Gruene Hall when he returned to the storied stage Wednesday night for the first time in 34 years. Country music fans tuned in to WranglerNetwork.com from all around the world covering 42 countries and generating more than 14 million media impressions, surpassing the platform’s previous viewership records. The momentous show was in celebration of Strait’s impressive three-disc, 56-track collection, Strait Out of the Box: Part 2, available today, exclusively at Walmart and Walmart.com. In addition to the online crowd and the invitation-only audience inside the 138-year-old dance hall, scores of fans surrounded the hall’s open-air perimeter to catch a glimpse of the 28-song set. A lucky few – including fellow Universal Music Group Nashville recording artist Jon Pardi and Texas recording artists and friends of Wrangler Casey Donahew and Aaron Watson – watched from inside the intimate venue. Gruene Hall has not only served as a starting point for Strait’s career, but was also featured on the album covers for Strait’s 2009 Twang album along with his 1981 debut album, Strait Country. “This was an event we may never again see in the history of music,” said Craig Errington, vice president of marketing, Wrangler. “We’re honored to be able to bring such a monumental moment involving the King of Country Music to hundreds of thousands of fans through the Wrangler Network.” This event kicked off an innovative music content agreement between Wrangler and Universal Music Group Nashville (UMGN) promising viewers curated content available exclusively through Wrangler Network. Production is slated to include acoustic performances from top UMG Nashville artists and lifestyle vignettes featuring both legendary and rising talent. The Wrangler-George Strait relationship dates back to the 80s and has become one of the longest-running brand-artist partnerships in the history of country music. This week, Wrangler announced a seven-year extension to the pair’s licensing agreement for the signature Wrangler George Strait Cowboy Cut Collection, which will expand to include women’s styles in 2017.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Hayley Peterson (hpeterson@businessinsider.com) Nov 18th 2016 4:10PM Whole Foods is taking some cues from Walmart in its latest effort to shed its "whole paycheck" image. The grocery chain is now stamping its paper shopping bags with a familiar tagline: "great everyday low prices." The tagline is familiar because it's nearly identical to the famous "everyday low prices" slogan that has been at the center of Walmart's marketing strategy for the last 50 years. SEE MORE: Here's how much Donald Trump made on 'The Apprentice' The concept behind the strategy and tagline is this: Customers don't need to wait for coupons or sales to shop at Walmart, because Walmart always offers the lowest prices. Many retailers have attempted to copy that concept over the years, but few have been successful. Most retailers resort to the more commonly used promotional strategy known as "high-low" marketing that's marked by frequent sales and coupons. 12 PHOTOS 11 best things to buy at Whole Foods See Gallery 11 best things to buy at Whole Foods Freshly baked bread  Photo: Getty 365 Everyday Value Greek Yogurt Photo: Getty Speciality cheeses Photo: Getty Oats, grains and beans in the DIY bulk section Photo: Getty Frozen foods, i.e. pizza and turkey burgers  Photo: Getty Alternative milk products Photo credit: Getty Frozen berries Photo: Shutterstock Raisins and dry fruit in the DIY bulk section Photo: Getty Spices in the DIY bulk section  Photo: Getty 365 Everyday Value Olive Oil Photo: Getty Freshly baked goods from the bakery section  Photo: Shutterstock Up Next See Gallery Discover More Like This of SEE ALL BACK TO SLIDE SHOW CAPTION + HIDE CAPTION – It's unclear whether Whole Foods was intentionally copying Walmart's tagline on the shopping bags, or if it was simply an oversight. The company did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment on this story. Whole Foods first started referring to "everyday low prices" last year when it announced the rollout of its cheaper chain of stores, called 365 by Whole Foods Market. In a press release, the company said "the new stores will offer convenience and everyday low prices on natural and organic products." EXPLORE MORE: Retail expert reveals Black Friday shopping secrets Whole Foods launched the 365 chain, in part, to enable the company to reach more lower-income, urban markets where a traditional Whole Foods store is less likely to succeed. Now, in the face of declining same-store sales at its traditional stores, Whole Foods is shifting the "everyday low prices" strategy to its namesake chain, which has struggled with the perception that its food is overpriced, therefore earning the nickname "whole paycheck." The company has dropped prices to try and better compete with the growing number of retailers now offering natural and organic foods. But sales at stores open at least a year are still falling. Whole Foods' same-store sales dropped 2.6% in the most recent quarter.

Denise Collier-Bailey said she noticed two men sitting the vestibule on her way into the Walmart store in Short Pump, and once she was inside her daughter asked a surprising question: "Did you see that deer in the shopping cart?" The pair double-backed and captured photos of the deer, which they said was dripping blood on the floor. "It's just one of those crazy Walmart pictures," Collier-Bailey told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. "If I hadn't been there to witness it myself, I wouldn't have believed it." A Walmart spokesman confirmed the incident and said a store manager told the men to take their deer out of the building. He said the deer was never taken into any shopping areas of the store. Lee Walker of the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries said the men might have been trying to follow state law by having their deer checked in, but Walmart is not an approved checking station "It appears that they were trying to follow the law by checking in the harvested deer, but were not at an approved check station," Walker told WTVR-TV. "In most cases hunters do not bring harvested game actually into an approved checked station, but rather have someone from the store come out to verify the harvest and to record the needed information."

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Nov 18, 2016 at 12:40PM Warren Buffett's forever-style investing approach has made him one of the planet's wealthiest people and the poster child of long-term investing. His tremendous success over the past 50 years suggests that investors ought to pay attention to what stocks he's buying, but it also suggests that they might want to focus even more on what stocks he's selling. Fortunately, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) (NYSE:BRK-A) files a 13F report with the SEC that shows what he's been selling, and according to the most recent filing, Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU), Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT), and Deere & Co. (NYSE:DE) have all fallen out of favor with the Oracle of Omaha. Read on to learn more about these companies, why Warren Buffett might be selling shares, and whether or not you should follow his footsteps away from the stocks. Image source: Suncor Energy. Giving up on oil sands Warren Buffett sold 7.7 million shares of Suncor Energy in the second quarter and in the third quarter, he unloaded the rest of his remaining 22.3 million shares. His decision to sell shares in the large Canadian oil-sands player might have stemmed from increasing concern that global oil and gas prices would remain under pressure for the foreseeable future. Rising U.S. production has caused oil and gas prices to slump significantly in the past year, and that's taken a toll on companies like Suncor that make their money producing, refining, and marketing oil products. While the company earned over $4 billion a few years ago, its net loss totals $1.6 billion over the past 12 months: SU Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts. Warren Buffett's decision could also have been influenced by Suncor's spending plans. In June, Suncor diluted investors with a 82.2 million share offering that raised $2.9 billion in capital. Suncor plans on using the money for acquisitions. Ultimately, Suncor could swing back to a profit if oil and gas prices bounce back. Its M&A (mergers and acquisitions) plans could also pay off long-term. Nevertheless, uncertainty related to both of these factors appears to have convinced Buffett that it's better to wait and watch from the sidelines. Cooling off on competition Wal-Mart has been a Warren Buffett holding for years, but he's soured on the stock this past year in the face of rising competition from online retail giant Amazon.com. Berkshire Hathaway sold 4 million shares of Wal-Mart late last year, another 15 million shares in the second quarter, and an additional 27.3 million shares in the third quarter. The pace of Buffett's selling suggests to me that he plans to sell his remaining 12.9 million shares before the end of this year. If that's the case, then it marks a seismic shift in his opinion of the company, which has been steadily losing wallet share to online retailers. In a bid to keep those competitors at bay, Wal-Mart has taken a hard line with suppliers lately that may indicate a profit-unfriendly price war is afoot. Now that we're bumping up on the ever-important holiday shopping season, Warren Buffett's selling doesn't add confidence that Wal-Mart can fend off its online rival anytime soon, and that could be reason enough for you to head for the exit too. Image source: Deere & Co. Plowing up less profit Until recently, Warren Buffett had been increasing Berkshire Hathaway's exposure to Deere & Co. However, Warren Buffett used some of Deere's rally this past summer to pare back his stake in the farm-machinery Goliath. Warren Buffett sold 874,185 shares in Deere & Co. in the third quarter, reducing his stake by 3.98% to 21.1 million shares. Despite the selling, Berkshire Hathaway remains Deere's biggest institutional investor, but that could change if Warren Buffett's outlook on grain prices and farm income shifts, due to the election of Donald Trump as America's next president. Although Deere & Co. shares are up 22% this year, the company's profit has slumped substantially as farm income has declined to its lowest point since the Great Recession. Through the first nine months of the year, Deere & Co.'s $1.24 billion profit was considerably lower than the $1.59 billion profit it posted in the comparable period of 2015. Deere & Co.'s global equipment sales declined 14% year over year in Q3, suggesting that slowing machinery demand continues to drag on the bottom line. So far, Warren Buffett has looked beyond this year's slide in demand and profit, toward rising global food demand driven by an increasingly larger population. Now that Trump's secured the White House, Deere's potential to tap into that opportunity might change. The company could benefit from rising infrastructure spending, but a strong dollar and a trade war with China, Mexico, and Canada could offset much, if not all, of that benefit. Overall, it's anyone's guess how Warren Buffett will weigh these competing factors, so investors will want to keep close tabs on Berkshire Hathaway's 13F over the next couple quarters to see whether his selling accelerates.

LOUIS (KPLR) – The union representing local grocery store workers is taking aim on an easy target. UFCW Local 655 hopes to exploit Stan Kroenke’s ties to Walmart in an attempt to win over customers for Dierbergs, Schnucks, and Shop ‘n Save stores. “He is the Grinch that stole our football team,” said David Coog, President UFCW Local 655. The union is spending $500,000 on a television and radio ad campaign. One of those ads encourages shoppers support stores with union workers instead of Walmart. The ad calls Kroenke a “Walmart billionaire” and makes reference to the fact he moved the St. Louis Rams to Los Angeles. It’s no secret union supporters and Walmart have been at odds over the years. UFCW Local 655 recently settled a rocky contract negotiation with Schnucks. Kroenke married into the Walmart family and built his own fortune in part by developing strip malls. Many of the developments were anchored with a Walmart store. “We’ll be running one week of heavy television commercials backed up by radio spots and then going back and forth between TV and radio through the holiday season,” Cook said. Fox 2 News reached out to Stan Kroenke’s representatives for comment but we have not received a response. Walmart sent our station the below statement and mapped out some of its economic impact in Missouri. The retailer reports it employs 43,646 associates in Missouri and supports nearly 59,953 supplier jobs. Walmart reports its foundation has donated $42.7 million in cash and in-kind donations during the 2016 fiscal year, and paid $96.9 million in taxes in Missouri during the 2016 fiscal year. “More than 13,000 people in the St. Louis area are working at Walmart this holiday season, helping their neighbors save time and money as they shop. We’re proud of what they do every day to take care of their community, and we appreciate their continued focus on providing great service to customers during this busy time of year.” Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Web Cameras See LIVE images of locations around St. Louis.

His tremendous success over the past 50 years suggests that investors ought to pay attention to what stocks he’s buying, but it also suggests that they might want to focus even more on what stocks he’s selling. Fortunately, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) (NYSE: BRK-A) files a 13F report with the SEC that shows what he’s been selling, and according to the most recent filing, Suncor Energy (NYSE: SU), Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT), and Deere & Co. (NYSE: DE) have all fallen out of favor with the Oracle of Omaha. Continue Reading Below Read on to learn more about these companies, why Warren Buffett might be selling shares, and whether or not you should follow his footsteps away from the stocks. Image source: Suncor Energy. Giving up on oil sands More From Fool.com Warren Buffett sold 7.7 million shares of Suncor Energy in the second quarter and in the third quarter, he unloaded the rest of his remaining 22.3 million shares. His decision to sell shares in the large Canadian oil-sands player might have stemmed from increasing concern that global oil and gas prices would remain under pressure for the foreseeable future. Rising U.S. production has caused oil and gas prices to slump significantly in the past year, and that’s taken a toll on companies like Suncor that make their money producing, refining, and marketing oil products. While the company earned over $4 billion a few years ago, its net loss totals $1.6 billion over the past 12 months: Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT SU Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts. Warren Buffett’s decision could also have been influenced by Suncor’s spending plans. In June, Suncor diluted investors with a 82.2 million share offering that raised $2.9 billion in capital. Suncor plans on using the money for acquisitions. Ultimately, Suncor could swing back to a profit if oil and gas prices bounce back. Its M&A (mergers and acquisitions) plans could also pay off long-term. Nevertheless, uncertainty related to both of these factors appears to have convinced Buffett that it’s better to wait and watch from the sidelines. Cooling off on competition Wal-Mart has been a Warren Buffett holding for years, but he’s soured on the stock this past year in the face of rising competition from online retail giant Amazon.com. Berkshire Hathaway sold 4 million shares of Wal-Mart late last year, another 15 million shares in the second quarter, and an additional 27.3 million shares in the third quarter. The pace of Buffett’s selling suggests to me that he plans to sell his remaining 12.9 million shares before the end of this year. If that’s the case, then it marks a seismic shift in his opinion of the company, which has been steadily losing wallet share to online retailers. In a bid to keep those competitors at bay, Wal-Mart has taken a hard line with suppliers lately that may indicate a profit-unfriendly price war is afoot. Now that we’re bumping up on the ever-important holiday shopping season, Warren Buffett’s selling doesn’t add confidence that Wal-Mart can fend off its online rival anytime soon, and that could be reason enough for you to head for the exit too. Image source: Deere & Co. Plowing up less profit Until recently, Warren Buffett had been increasing Berkshire Hathaway’s exposure to Deere & Co. However, Warren Buffett used some of Deere’s rally this past summer to pare back his stake in the farm-machinery Goliath. Warren Buffett sold 874,185 shares in Deere & Co. in the third quarter, reducing his stake by 3.98% to 21.1 million shares. Despite the selling, Berkshire Hathaway remains Deere’s biggest institutional investor, but that could change if Warren Buffett’s outlook on grain prices and farm income shifts, due to the election of Donald Trump as America’s next president. Although Deere & Co. shares are up 22% this year, the company’s profit has slumped substantially as farm income has declined to its lowest point since the Great Recession. Through the first nine months of the year, Deere & Co.’s $1.24 billion profit was considerably lower than the $1.59 billion profit it posted in the comparable period of 2015. Deere & Co.’s global equipment sales declined 14% year over year in Q3, suggesting that slowing machinery demand continues to drag on the bottom line. So far, Warren Buffett has looked beyond this year’s slide in demand and profit, toward rising global food demand driven by an increasingly larger population. Now that Trump’s secured the White House, Deere’s potential to tap into that opportunity might change. The company could benefit from rising infrastructure spending, but a strong dollar and a trade war with China, Mexico, and Canada could offset much, if not all, of that benefit. Overall, it’s anyone’s guess how Warren Buffett will weigh these competing factors, so investors will want to keep close tabs on Berkshire Hathaway’s 13F over the next couple quarters to see whether his selling accelerates. Forget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart Stores Donald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up.

 Whole Foods is copying Walmart to try and get rid of its 'whole paycheck’ image Hayley Peterson Nov. 18, 2016, 12:21 PM 4,876 facebook linkedin twitter email print Business Insider Whole Foods is taking some cues from Walmart in its latest effort to shed its "whole paycheck" image. The grocery chain is now stamping its paper shopping bags with a familiar tagline: "great everyday low prices."  The tagline is familiar because it's nearly identical to the famous "everyday low prices" slogan that has been at the center of Walmart's marketing strategy for the last 50 years. The concept behind the strategy and tagline is this: Customers don't need to wait for coupons or sales to shop at Walmart, because Walmart always offers the lowest prices. Many retailers have attempted to copy that concept over the years, but few have been successful. Most retailers resort to the more commonly used promotional strategy known as "high-low" marketing that's marked by frequent sales and coupons. Every price sign in Walmart stores is tagged with the "everyday low price" tagline. Reuters It's unclear whether Whole Foods was intentionally copying Walmart's tagline on the shopping bags, or if it was simply an oversight.  The company did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment on this story. Whole Foods first started referring to "everyday low prices" last year when it announced the rollout of its cheaper chain of stores, called 365 by Whole Foods Market. In a press release, the company said "the new stores will offer convenience and everyday low prices on natural and organic products." Whole Foods launched the 365 chain, in part, to enable the company to reach more lower-income, urban markets where a traditional Whole Foods store is less likely to succeed. AP Now, in the face of declining same-store sales at its traditional stores, Whole Foods is shifting the "everyday low prices" strategy to its namesake chain, which has struggled with the perception that its food is overpriced, therefore earning the nickname "whole paycheck." The company has dropped prices to try and better compete with the growing number of retailers now offering natural and organic foods. But sales at stores open at least a year are still falling.  Whole Foods' same-store sales dropped 2.6% in the most recent quarter.

If successful, the trial could change how Wal-Mart Stores, which serves some 260 million customers a week, monitors food and takes action when something goes wrong. That could spur big leaps in food safety, cut costs and save lives. Like most merchants, the world’s largest retailer struggles to identify and remove food that’s been recalled. When a customer becomes ill, it can take days to identify the product, shipment and vendor. With the blockchain, Wal-Mart will be able to obtain crucial data from a single receipt, including suppliers, details on how and where food was grown and who inspected it. The database extends information from the pallet to the individual package. “It gives them an ability to have an accounting from origin to completion,” said Marshal Cohen, an analyst at researcher NPD Group Inc. “If there’s an issue with an outbreak of E. coli, this gives them an ability to immediately find where it came from. That’s the difference between days and minutes.” It’s also the difference between pulling a few tainted packages and yanking all the spinach from hundreds of stores, according to Frank Yiannas, vice president of food safety at Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart. Article Continued Below “With blockchain, you can do strategic removals, and let consumers and companies have confidence,” Yiannas said. “We believe that enhanced traceability is good for other aspects of the food systems. We hope you could capture other important attributes that would inform decisions around food flows, and even get more efficient at it.” More than 1,000 foodborne outbreaks investigated by state and local health departments are reported each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. The CDC estimates roughly 48 million people are afflicted annually, with 128,000 hospitalized and 3,000 dying. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. has suffered a year of falling sales as a result of several outbreaks. In October, Wal-Mart started tracking two products using blockchain: a packaged produce item in the U.S., and pork in China. While only two items were included, the test involved thousands of packages shipped to multiple stores. The blockchain is a distributed ledger where companies doing business with one another, such as growers, distributors and retailers, can record transactions securely. The database’s strength lies in its trustworthiness: the difficulty of reversing or changing what’s been recorded. The blockchain database can also hold much more data than what retailers get today, providing tools for more detailed analysis. That could help Wal-Mart deliver food to stores faster, reducing spoilage and waste. Cutting costs is critical for all retailers. Last year, retail sales rose only 2.1 per cent, the smallest gain since 2009, according to Retail Industry Leaders Association. Traditional offline retailers continue to be pressured by Amazon.com Inc. and its efficient supply chain. If the tests are successful, Wal-Mart will expand them to multiple food items in both countries, Yiannis said. “So far things are flowing smoothly and as expected,” he said. Wal-Mart has been at the forefront of adopting new technologies before. It began installing new chip-card readers at U.S. checkout counters 10 years before the deadline mandated by credit-card networks like Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. This summer, it took Walmart Pay nationwide, becoming one of the first large retailers to launch its own mobile-payment service. It’s also expanding its online grocery delivery service. The blockchain, a technology that only came onto the scene in 2009, is already being widely tested by companies in the financial, healthcare and natural-resource industries. Companies like International Business Machines Corp., the Nasdaq and BHP Billiton Ltd. have deployed or are planning to deploy it to run their businesses more efficiently. Wal-Mart is using blockchain technology co-developed by IBM. In October, the company opened the Walmart Food Safety Collaboration Center in Beijing. It also announced, with IBM and Tsinghua University, a collaboration using the blockchain to improve the way food is tracked, transported and sold to Chinese consumers. If Wal-Mart adopts the blockchain to track food worldwide, it could become of the largest deployments of the technology to date. “They are setting the new standards in terms of how technology can be implemented to solve a problem that’s been with us for ages,” said Paul Chang, global supply chain subject matter expert at IBM.

Keep reading to see which one is the better buy today. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Nov 18, 2016 at 9:35AM Two of the biggest mass merchandise retailers, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT), are often seen as competitors, even though they target different demographics. Target is best known for its "cheap chic" product line, which often includes tie-ups with designers. It focuses on categories like kids and wellness, and tends to target urban millennials. Wal-Mart, on the other hand, tends to draw lower-income consumers, and has most of its stores in suburban and rural parts of the country, especially across the South. More than half of its sales come from grocery. Both of these stocks have struggled in recent years as the bulk of the gains in retail have gone to companies like Amazon.com and Costco Wholesale. Wal-Mart and Target aren't standing still as the retail landscape changes -- both have made investments in e-commerce and adapted their physical store strategy. Let's take a closer look at how each company is doing to see which is the better buy today. Image Source: Wal-Mart.  A whole new Wal-Mart Wal-Mart has made several changes in the last two years to revamp the company and bring back sales growth. It raised its base wage to $9/hour last year and $10/hour this year, a move that will cost it $2.7 billion annually. The company expects profits to fall this year due in part to that investment, but it's helped drive same-store sales up for nine quarters in a row. In the third quarter of this year, comparable sales grew 1.2%. On the e-commerce front, it also made a splash with its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com earlier this year. Management hopes the deal will jump start online sales at Wal-Mart, thanks to Jet.com's "smart basket" technology, which lowers prices based on decisions customers make like foregoing returns or paying with a debit card. Jet Founder Marc Lore has also agreed to stay at the retailer for five years, and he's begun putting his own imprint on the company; several former e-commerce executives are leaving Wal-Mart, and he's brought in his exec from Jet.   In the third quarter, Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales jumped 21%, its best performance in over a year, and contributed 50 basis points to comparable sales growth. Looking ahead, the company is scaling back on new store openings to focus on e-commerce and improving its current fleet of stores. It's also found success with its grocery pickup program, which allows customers to order groceries on the internet and pick them up from a parking lot kiosk. Those investments are expected to return the company to profit growth by 2018. Image Source: Motley Fool.  Trying to hit the bullseye Target shares skyrocketed earlier this week after its earnings report came out, but the 7% jump was more the result of lowered expectations rather than strong results. Same-store sales fell for the second quarter in a row, but did better than expectations, dropping 0.2% against estimates of a 1.1% slide. There were other promising signs, including a 22% increase in adjusted earnings per share, and the company raised its full-year guidance, though that came after lowering it in the previous report. Online sales were up 26% in the quarter, but the company sees comparable sales roughly flat for the holiday quarter. While Target is executing in its Signature Categories, which include baby, home, and wellness, with 3% comparable sales growth, it's struggling elsewhere. Its entry into groceries has been plagued by low-volume sales, resulting in spoilage, and the company has been raising prices at a time when many of its competitors are lowering them. In fact, it promised to do a better job on implementing the second half of it "Expect More. Pay Less" slogan. The retailer has also seen several executives leave recently in what could be a sign of discord in the C-suite. Management plans to open hundreds of small-format stores in cities, and opened 10 such stores in the last quarter. Those could reach an untapped market, but competitors, namely Wal-Mart, have been unable to pull off such a transition.  CEO Brian Cornell expressed confidence in the strategy, but driving traffic to its current store fleet will continue to be the key determinant of the company's success. And the winner is... Both companies are fighting uphill battles as the retail landscape shifts, and the two stocks offer similar valuations and dividend yields. However, Wal-Mart seems to have a better strategy for long-term growth. Its acquisition of Jet.com and expansion of grocery pickup should help fuel e-commerce sales, and investments in stores should keep comparable sales increasing. Target may perform better in the near term as Wal-Mart is still forecasting flat earnings growth next year, but over the long term I'd expect Wal-Mart to be the better buy of the two.

Recent Posts: Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Can Save Itself With This Move Target Corporation (TGT) Stock Looks Even Better With Urban Strategy Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) Stock Light on Revenue, But Can Explain View All Posts While Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) are considered the “Coke and Pepsi” of modern discount retail, they’re not nearly as similar as most people think. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) For one thing, WMT generates much more volume per quarter, about $120 billion, than TGT generates in a year, about $70 billion. Target’s results are also choppier. It had a great Christmas last year, but a massive theft of customer data by hackers in 2013 hampered results for years and resulted in a turnover of the executive suite. The history is also different. Walmart started as a discount chain, while TGT is descended from the old Dayton’s department stores, which were eventually merged with Marshall Field’s and spun out in 2004. Target is generally more corporate than WMT, which is still run in the image of entrepreneurial founder Sam Walton. Target stock is riskier, but its smaller size means it can change strategies quickly. The company has changed its strategy lately, under new CEO Brian Cornell, and investors need to understand the changes before buying Target stock. TGT Is Becoming a City Mouse Early in 2016, the big story at TGT was that it was beating WMT in e-commerce. It integrated its online store with in-store pick-ups last Christmas, growing online sales by 30%, and was planning $2.5 billion of investments in technology by 2017. 7 Stocks to Buy From the Scrap Heap Analysts were initially skeptical of it’s move, and early results were poor, but last Christmas made analysts believers of Target stock and the company is now considered an e-commerce leader. Cornell’s latest move is even bigger. He’s going to make TGT the City Mouse to Walmart’s Country Mouse. Target plans to open hundreds of small-format stores, mostly in large cities, reshaping the company’s image and real estate footprint in the process. WMT CEO Doug McMillon had tried something similar starting in 2014, opening Neighborhood Markets and planning Walmart Express stores built around gas stations, but Walmart abandoned the plan this year, closing 269 outlets. The difference between the two plans lies in where the small stores are, and who they are aiming at. While the Walmart Neighborhood Markets were in suburbs, and represented in-fill between larger Walmart SuperCenters, the new TGT stores are in the center of cities, and in college towns, highlighted by a 45,000 square-foot unit in Tribeca, in lower Manhattan. While the Neighborhood Markets were also smaller, cookie-cutter versions of WMT’s larger outlets, heavy on the groceries and mostly self-service, the new Target stores are customized to their neighborhoods and the company is investing heavily in its supply chain to get the specific goods each location needs.

Brands Cut Food Waste Food Waste Reduction Goal Gets Industry Praise Walmart, Suppliers Launch Recycling Fund Global Food Companies ‘Should Upgrade Sustainable Supply Chain Strategies’ Related Topics Food & Beverage Retail & Restaurants Sustainable Strategy & Leadership Waste & Recycling Waste Management Major companies including General Mills, Kellogg, PepsiCo, Unilever and Walmart have pledged to halve food waste and loss in their operations by 2030. The EPA and US Department of Agriculture announced the first 15 US Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions yesterday: Ahold USA, Blue Apron, Bon Appétit Management Company, Campbell Soup Company, Conagra Brands, Delhaize America, General Mills, Kellogg Company, PepsiCo, Sodexo, Unilever, Walmart, Wegman’s Food Markets, Weis Markets and Yum! Brands. “Already, Kellogg has reduced waste sent to landfill by more than 60 percent since 2005, including food waste,” said Diane Holdorf, Kellogg’s chief sustainability officer, in a statement. “We remain committed to ensuring edible food waste is donated to feed people in need, when appropriate. We also will continue our partnerships to develop sustainable agriculture programs with smallholder farmers that help prevent post-harvest loss in major ingredients relevant to Kellogg.” Each 2030 Champion has agreed to establish a baseline marking where they are today and will measure and report on their progress toward the goal. Because there are many ways to define and measure food waste, the EPA directs businesses to the Food Loss and Waste Protocol for information on defining and transparently measuring food loss and waste. The EPA estimates that more food reaches landfills and incinerators than any other single material, making up about 21 percent of the US waste stream. Reducing food waste also impacts climate change as 20 percent of total US methane emissions come from landfills. Reducing food waste can be an economic boost to companies as well. A recent study that looked at business opportunities related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals found the biggest is in reducing food waste in the value chain, which could yield up to $405 billion annually in economic benefits. The 2030 Champions announcement follows the first-ever US food loss and waste reduction goal announced in September 2015. “Reducing food waste is good for business, it’s good for the environment and it’s good for our communities,” said EPA administrator Gina McCarthy. “We need leaders in every field and every sector to help us reach our food loss goal. That’s why we’re excited to work with the 2030 Champions and others across the food retail industry as we work together to ensure that we feed families instead of landfills.” Businesses Can Save Billions by Cutting Food Waste How Campbell’s, ConAgra Foods, Yum!

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next NASHVILLE, Tenn. - A man has been recovering after being stabbed near a South Nashville Walmart. The incident happened around 11:30 p.m. Thursday at the Walmart on Nolensville Pike. According to police, the victim was stabbed in the ribs. Walmart security officers were the ones who first reported the incident. At first, firefighter paramedics examined him, but they said he refused treatment. Officers added the man also refused to tell them what had happened to cause his injury. However, officers were at the Walmart not long after the initial call on an unrelated call, and the victim from the stabbing earlier walked up and requested medical treatment.   The fire department transported him to Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Police said they believe the victim has been homeless and was staying in the woods nearby. At last check, he had still not given any additional information about what took place.

PHOTO: Zak Suhar Every website developer hopes to provide the best possible customer experience. This is especially important for retail sites, where positive customer experiences can immediately result in sales. However, most retail websites fall short of the mark. Why is that? Let's take a closer look at some of the top retail websites, analyze their strengths and weaknesses, and share some of the lessons to be learned. Evaluating 5 Retail Websites A cursory analysis of the top five retailer websites in the US — Walmart, Kroger, Costco, Walgreens and Home Depot — revealed the following issues: Slow Page Speeds Page load times are critical for retailers. Consumers expect a certain level of performance from the pages they visit, and are likely to leave pages that do not appear in a certain timeframe. For e-commerce websites, slow pages translate directly into lost sales. Surprisingly, the top two retailers, Walmart and Kroger, performed the worst in our speed tests. Some of their pages took as long as 13 seconds to load. According to Kissmetrics, 47 percent of consumers expect a web page to load in two seconds or less, and a one second delay in page response can result in a 7 percent reduction in conversions. For large retailers like Walmart and Kroger, this can result in millions of dollars in lost sales. Websites are generally slow because of third-party services and their associated DNS lookups. The top retailers employ sophisticated marketing technologies to study and forecast consumer buying patterns. They do this by adding third-party services that capture and report this information. The problem is that there are many criteria that can be analyzed, and each will often add a separate DNS lookup. Sometimes, you can track too much. Third-party services are valuable tools to today’s retail marketers, but they can be overused. Be sure to regularly monitor your page load times. If they are longer than two seconds, reduce the number of third-party services, pre-fetch DNS requests or move tracking scripts to your CDN.  Lack of Security Security is a must on retail websites. Customers are required to enter sensitive information in every transaction, and it is critical that retailers protect this information every step of the process. Given that, it's surprising that Home Depot’s main website does not use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), a standard technology for establishing a secure link between a browser and a web server. It uses encryption technology to protect all communications. To be fair, Home Depot does use SSL once you are on the transaction pages, but even parts of those pages are not secure and will trigger Mixed Content warnings in some browsers. This will leave some users wondering if the experience is secure. Home Depot should use SSL throughout its website. Its web developers might argue that they took this approach to keep the website lean and fast. That is true, but the impact is very small. If the developers implemented SSL throughout the website, they could easily offset any hit on performance by scaling and optimizing some of the images on their site.   Google recognizes the risks. Google’s popular Chrome browser — which has 42 percent market share according to NetMarketShare — is going to start warning users about SSL compliance on websites. The browser will start shaming websites that don’t have SSL on them by displaying a red “X” next to their URL to warn users of the security risks. SSL utilization also impacts rankings within Google’s search results algorithm. Poor SEO SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the collection of strategies and techniques retailers use to get their products in front of potential customers via the popular search engines (e.g., Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc.). Many customers — even avid Amazon customers — usually start their online shopping at Google because it allows them to compare prices at multiple stores. If the pricing is about the same, Amazon may earn the sale. However, if another retailer offers exceptionally pricing, then they will probably buy it there. The top five retailers we analyzed all could stand improvement based on our SEO tests. They all tend to reuse the same descriptions, headings or keywords across multiple product pages, which makes it difficult to differentiate the product pages. It's very difficult to write unique product descriptions and headers for hundreds of thousands of products. Instead, large retailers may auto-generate their descriptions and headings where they haven’t curated the SEO tags. This is an area that could offer a distinct advantage for smaller retailers. Large retailers don’t have the manpower to effectively market every product, but specialty retailers could successfully own a brand or niche. For example, a specialty kitchen supplier will never sell as many faucets as Home Depot, but it might want to own the Google keywords for specific high-end brands to drive customers to its store. Website Analysis is Critical This review of the top retailer websites revealed some very common issues that can be easily diagnosed through proper website analysis. Website analysis is an important part of the website development and maintenance process. At the end of the day, the goal is to sell as many products online as possible. That cannot be achieved without first providing a fast, safe and secure web experience. This article is based on website analysis performed in mid-October 2016.  No destructive testing occurred.

Tonight Mostly clear. Low 26F. Winds light and variable. Updated: November 20, 2016 @ 11:15 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Photos Obits Classifieds AP Business Highlights By The Associated Press Updated Nov 17, 2016 ___ Yellen says she isn't going anywhere when Trump takes office WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen appears unruffled by incoming President Donald Trump's victory last week. Her remarks to Congress Thursday suggest that the central bank is on track to raise interest rates at its meeting in December, one month before Trumps takes office. She said she has no plans to step down before her four-year term ends on Feb. 3, 2018, reiterated the Fed's political independence and vigorously defended tougher bank regulations established in the wake of the financial crisis. An improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising interest rates, Yellen told Congress' Joint Economic Committee. ___ America's shift to SUVs is on display at L.A. Auto Show America's shift from cars to SUVs is starting to look permanent, and automakers are scrambling to meet the demand. Toyota, Ford, Subaru, Jeep and Volkswagen are all showing new SUVs at this week's Los Angeles Auto Show. Even traditional luxury car makers like Jaguar and Alfa Romeo are debuting SUVs. Americans bought more SUVs than four-door cars for the first time last year, and the momentum is growing. But unlike the previous SUV boom, which fell victim to rising gas prices, this one is likely to stay as automakers offer more small SUVs with better fuel economy. ___ Ex-Valeant, Philidor execs arrested for fraud, conspiracy Former executives of Valeant Pharmaceuticals and a related mail-order pharmacy were charged Thursday with running a fraud-and-kickback scheme that bilked Valeant out of millions of dollars. Their arrests are part of an ongoing investigation, according to Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who said other arrests are possible. Bharara's office said it has charged Gary Tanner, a former Valeant executive, and Andrew Davenport, who had been the chief executive of Philidor, a mail-order pharmacy that is now defunct, with two counts of wire fraud, along with money laundering and conspiracy. ___ Bank stocks surge again, leading broader market higher NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose Thursday as banks resumed their steep upward climb and retailers moved higher. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen emphasized that the Fed plans to raise interest rates, which will help banks make more money from lending. Stocks started the day with small gains and moved higher following Yellen's testimony to Congress. Banks once again marched higher as investors cheered the latest indication that interest rates will rise from their current ultra-low levels. Retailers also rose after strong earnings from Best Buy, while food and household goods makers struggled after weak results from Wal-Mart and J.M. Smucker. ___ Wal-Mart's profit falls but beats estimates; revenue misses NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. saw its third-quarter profit fall more than 8 percent, dragged down as it continues to plow money into e-commerce and improving its stores. While online sales improved, overall revenue fell short of expectations as the company said it was hurt in part by falling food prices. Profit at the world's largest retailer still beat Wall Street expectations, and it lifted the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast. Investors focused on the sales, though, sending shares in the retailer down. ___ Gap's third-quarter profit drops nearly 18 percent NEW YORK (AP) — Gap's third-quarter profit fell nearly 18 percent, undercut by costs related to store closures outside North America. Gap Inc. shares fell in after-market trading Thursday as the company said the slump in the number of people visiting its stores continues as it heads into the critical holiday shopping season. Gap is facing the same problems as other fashion retailers, with shoppers buying less clothing in general and also favoring off-price chains like T.J. Maxx. But Gap is also struggling with identity problems, mired in a slump as its fashions just don't stand out in an overcrowded landscape. ___ JPMorgan Chase to pay $264 million in Chinese bribery case NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. has agreed to pay $264.4 million in fines to federal authorities to settle criminal and civil charges that it hired friends and relatives of Chinese officials in order to gain access to banking deals in that country. JPMorgan's Asia affiliate allegedly created a quid pro quo program that would hire the children and friends of high-ranking Chinese officials, regardless of the person's qualifications, in order to gain favor and win banking deals. ___ Tesla, SolarCity get shareholder approval for merger Tesla Motors got approval from investors to combine with SolarCity Corp. in an effort to expand the market for solar power and give electric car owners new options for solar charging. Shareholders of both companies backed the merger by a wide margin Thursday. The deal, first proposed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk proposed in June, has had more of a mixed reaction on Wall Street. Analysts wondered why Tesla would want to take on SolarCity while busy with its own goals. There were also complaints of a conflict of interest for Musk, who is chairman of both companies. ___ Wells Fargo sees significant slowdown in account openings NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo disclosed signs on Thursday that its customers are significantly pulling back from doing business with the bank, a reverberation of the sales practices scandal that drew a huge fine in September. Because of the timing, its data for October is the first full-picture view of customer reaction and it is not pretty. New customer account openings fell 44 percent in October from a year earlier, while account closures rose 3 percent from the previous year. The bank saw a 50 percent drop in credit card applications. ___ Verizon's AOL cutting 500 jobs, will focus on mobile, video NEW YORK (AP) — AOL is cutting about 500 jobs, or 8 percent of its workforce, as it trims back following some deals and focuses on mobile, video and data. In a memo to employees, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong says the Verizon-owned company has added 1,500 employees over the past year because of acquisitions and partnerships, and it needs to consolidate to improve operations. Armstrong says AOL will add jobs in the areas that are driving growth. ___ Sorry Trump, NY Times says subscriptions rose since election NEW YORK (AP) — The New York Times pushed back against President-elect Donald Trump, saying Thursday that its paid subscriptions have jumped since the election, despite Trump's accusations. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that the Times "is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the 'Trump phenomena.'" The Times said Thursday that it added 41,000 paid subscriptions to its newspaper and digital news products in the week since Election Day. The increase is its largest one-week rise since 2011, when it launched its digital subscription model. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average added 35.68 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 18,903.82. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 10.18 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,187.12. The Nasdaq composite added 39.39 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,333.97. Benchmark U.S. crude slid 15 cents to $45.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slipped 14 cents to $46.49 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.34 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.45 a gallon. Natural gas fell 6 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.70 per 1,000 cubic feet. ___ The first item has been corrected to read that Yellen's term ends on Feb. 3, 2018, not January 2018.

By Jamie Young November 17, 2016   Black Friday is the one-day shopping extravaganza frugal shoppers look forward to all year. On the Friday after Thanksgiving, stores such as Walmart and Best Buy attract dedicated shoppers who are looking to score huge deals on holiday gifts before Christmas. And over the last decade, Black Friday shopping has brought out the worst in people. From violent outbursts to fights and stampedes that, in some cases, have caused injuries — or worse. Here are the worst Black Friday sales nightmares that will make you want to stay home this Thanksgiving weekend. It’s Raining Gift Cards In 2006, a mall in Torrance, Calif., came up with a promotion to give away gift certificates to customers on Black Friday, according to Business Daily News. Management, however, dramatically underestimated the turnout — but that wasn’t the only mistake the promotion’s organizers made. Instead of simply handing out the 500 gift cards, the staff dropped them from the ceiling on the frenzied mass of 2,000 frantic shoppers below. Not a good idea. The result? A stampede that left 10 people injured, including an elderly woman. Don’t Miss: Leaked Black Friday Ads for 2016 Black Friday Zombie Apocalypse When an Upland, Calif., Walmart decided to stay open all night in 2009, management probably thought they were going to reduce the chance of Black Friday chaos by eliminating long lines and a mad rush when the doors opened. But when rowdy customers began fighting inside and tearing into shrink-wrapped merchandise intended to be opened at 5 a.m. the next day, the retailer decided to call the cops, kick everyone out and clean up before the 5 a.m. sale, according to the Los Angeles Times. Irate customers outside then began banging on the glass — like zombies — and looking for ways inside. Some even sneaking in through the lawn and garden section. Ready for War at Walmart In 2010, police arrested a man at the Boynton Beach, Fla., Walmart after a Black Friday shopper alerted them that she thought the man had a gun, according to The Ledger. It turns out, the over-prepared bargain hunter did have a gun — a .40-caliber Glock handgun. He also had a 30-round magazine, a pepper grenade, two concealed knives and a whole bunch of prescription pills — but no prescription. Related: Are Banks Open on Black Friday? Toys for Tots Stabbing In 2010, a U.S. marine was stabbed on Black Friday when trying to apprehend a fleeing thief at a Best Buy, according to CBS News. The shoplifter was caught on camera putting a laptop under his jacket at the Augusta, Ga., store. When confronted by Best Buy employees, the man pulled a knife and ran out the door. That’s when four marines, who were collecting toys outside for Toys for Tots, tried to stop the man and one of the marines got stabbed in the back. Luckily, the shoplifter was arrested and the marine survived. Violence R Us In 2010, police arrested a 21-year-old shopper in Toys “R” Us in Madison, Wis., according to CNN. The woman reportedly attempted to cut in line. When confronted by angry shoppers who had patiently waited their turn, the woman threatened to get her gun and shoot them. Police didn’t find a gun, but took the threat seriously enough to arrest her for disorderly conduct. In an interview with CNN, the suspect lamented that she was worried the toy she originally cut the line to get would be gone by the time she was released from jail. “I just wanted to get my daughter the toy she wanted for Christmas,” she said. Game Over At a Walmart in Buckeye, Ariz., the night before Black Friday in 2011, a 54-year-old grandfather was carted off to jail. An off-duty officer who was helping out the retailer said the man shoved a video game under his shirt in an attempt to shoplift the item, according to Azcentral.com, so the officer apprehended him — forcibly. The man’s wife, however, insisted that the ill-fated shopper put the game in his waistband so that he could pick up and protect his grandson from a mob of unruly shoppers. But police said other shoppers saw him try to steal the game and that he attempted to flee when police challenged him. A video of the incident’s aftermath raised questions about the use of force by the police present. The “leg sweep” that took him down left the man bleeding and seemingly unconscious. ‘Competitive Shopping’ and Pepper Spray Here’s another Black Friday nightmare that happened at Walmart in 2011, but this time in Porter Ranch, Calif. This was the site of a new form of Black Friday rage politely referred to as “competitive shopping” by a fire captain who spoke with the Los Angeles Times. Twenty people, including children, suffered injuries when a woman unleashed pepper spray on the crowd. She used the weapon not to defend herself from an attacker, but to clear a path through the crowd toward door buster merchandise. This caused shoppers to trample fallen merchandise as workers scrambled to get out of the way. Parking Spot Shooting On Black Friday in 2012, two people believed to have been arguing over a parking space were shot and injured, according to Fox News. In the parking lot of a Walmart in Tallahassee, Fla., two people were found shot and taken to a nearby hospital — though the wounds were said to not be life-threatening. ‘Self-Defense’ and Sucker Punches During Black Friday sales in 2012, a man was reportedly punched in the face at a San Antonio Sears. His response was to pull out a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun in “self-defense,” according to MySanAntonio.com. Police took the man who pulled out the handgun into custody, but later said the man was within his rights when he displayed the weapon. The Sears manager even gave him a store voucher, shockingly. The Flat-Screen TV Wave Black Friday shoppers in 2014 literally threw themselves on top of flat-screen TVs at a Stafford, Texas, Walmart after waiting in line for a few hours, according to ABC 13 (KTRK-TV). “People were climbing over each other to get a TV,” said one witness. “It was crazy.” The shoppers didn’t listen to the police officers’ orders to stop either — but no arrests were made that day. Up Next: 50 Easy Ways to Save for Holiday Shopping So, before heading out to find the best Black Friday sales on Thanksgiving weekend, you might want to reconsider. If you really want to avoid the craziness, wait until Monday — and take advantage of some great Cyber Monday deals instead. Andrew Lisa contributed to the reporting for this article.

Her remarks to Congress Thursday suggest that the central bank is on track to raise interest rates at its meeting in December, one month before Trumps takes office. She said she has no plans to step down before her four-year term ends on Feb. 3, 2018, reiterated the Fed’s political independence and vigorously defended tougher bank regulations established in the wake of the financial crisis. An improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising interest rates, Yellen told Congress’ Joint Economic Committee. ___ America’s shift to SUVs is on display at L.A. Auto Show America’s shift from cars to SUVs is starting to look permanent, and automakers are scrambling to meet the demand. Toyota, Ford, Subaru, Jeep and Volkswagen are all showing new SUVs at this week’s Los Angeles Auto Show. Even traditional luxury car makers like Jaguar and Alfa Romeo are debuting SUVs. Americans bought more SUVs than four-door cars for the first time last year, and the momentum is growing. But unlike the previous SUV boom, which fell victim to rising gas prices, this one is likely to stay as automakers offer more small SUVs with better fuel economy. ___ Ex-Valeant, Philidor execs arrested for fraud, conspiracy Former executives of Valeant Pharmaceuticals and a related mail-order pharmacy were charged Thursday with running a fraud-and-kickback scheme that bilked Valeant out of millions of dollars. Their arrests are part of an ongoing investigation, according to Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who said other arrests are possible. Bharara’s office said it has charged Gary Tanner, a former Valeant executive, and Andrew Davenport, who had been the chief executive of Philidor, a mail-order pharmacy that is now defunct, with two counts of wire fraud, along with money laundering and conspiracy. ___ Bank stocks surge again, leading broader market higher NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose Thursday as banks resumed their steep upward climb and retailers moved higher. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen emphasized that the Fed plans to raise interest rates, which will help banks make more money from lending. Stocks started the day with small gains and moved higher following Yellen’s testimony to Congress. Banks once again marched higher as investors cheered the latest indication that interest rates will rise from their current ultra-low levels. Retailers also rose after strong earnings from Best Buy, while food and household goods makers struggled after weak results from Wal-Mart and J.M. Smucker. ___ Wal-Mart’s profit falls but beats estimates; revenue misses NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. saw its third-quarter profit fall more than 8 per cent, dragged down as it continues to plow money into e-commerce and improving its stores. While online sales improved, overall revenue fell short of expectations as the company said it was hurt in part by falling food prices. Profit at the world’s largest retailer still beat Wall Street expectations, and it lifted the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast. Investors focused on the sales, though, sending shares in the retailer down. ___ Gap’s third-quarter profit drops nearly 18 per cent NEW YORK (AP) — Gap’s third-quarter profit fell nearly 18 per cent, undercut by costs related to store closures outside North America. Gap Inc. shares fell in after-market trading Thursday as the company said the slump in the number of people visiting its stores continues as it heads into the critical holiday shopping season. Gap is facing the same problems as other fashion retailers, with shoppers buying less clothing in general and also favouring off-price chains like T.J. Maxx. But Gap is also struggling with identity problems, mired in a slump as its fashions just don’t stand out in an overcrowded landscape. ___ JPMorgan Chase to pay $264 million in Chinese bribery case NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. has agreed to pay $264.4 million in fines to federal authorities to settle criminal and civil charges that it hired friends and relatives of Chinese officials in order to gain access to banking deals in that country. JPMorgan’s Asia affiliate allegedly created a quid pro quo program that would hire the children and friends of high-ranking Chinese officials, regardless of the person’s qualifications, in order to gain favour and win banking deals. ___ Tesla, SolarCity get shareholder approval for merger Tesla Motors got approval from investors to combine with SolarCity Corp. in an effort to expand the market for solar power and give electric car owners new options for solar charging. Shareholders of both companies backed the merger by a wide margin Thursday. The deal, first proposed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk proposed in June, has had more of a mixed reaction on Wall Street. Analysts wondered why Tesla would want to take on SolarCity while busy with its own goals. There were also complaints of a conflict of interest for Musk, who is chairman of both companies. ___ Wells Fargo sees significant slowdown in account openings NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo disclosed signs on Thursday that its customers are significantly pulling back from doing business with the bank, a reverberation of the sales practices scandal that drew a huge fine in September. Because of the timing, its data for October is the first full-picture view of customer reaction and it is not pretty. New customer account openings fell 44 per cent in October from a year earlier, while account closures rose 3 per cent from the previous year. The bank saw a 50 per cent drop in credit card applications. ___ Verizon’s AOL cutting 500 jobs, will focus on mobile, video NEW YORK (AP) — AOL is cutting about 500 jobs, or 8 per cent of its workforce, as it trims back following some deals and focuses on mobile, video and data. In a memo to employees, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong says the Verizon-owned company has added 1,500 employees over the past year because of acquisitions and partnerships, and it needs to consolidate to improve operations. Armstrong says AOL will add jobs in the areas that are driving growth. ___ Sorry Trump, NY Times says subscriptions rose since election NEW YORK (AP) — The New York Times pushed back against President-elect Donald Trump, saying Thursday that its paid subscriptions have jumped since the election, despite Trump’s accusations. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that the Times “is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the ‘Trump phenomena.'” The Times said Thursday that it added 41,000 paid subscriptions to its newspaper and digital news products in the week since Election Day. The increase is its largest one-week rise since 2011, when it launched its digital subscription model. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average added 35.68 points, or 0.2 per cent, to close at 18,903.82. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 10.18 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 2,187.12. The Nasdaq composite added 39.39 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 5,333.97. Benchmark U.S. crude slid 15 cents to $45.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slipped 14 cents to $46.49 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.34 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.45 a gallon. Natural gas fell 6 cents, or 2.2 per cent, to $2.70 per 1,000 cubic feet. ___ The first item has been corrected to read that Yellen’s term ends on Feb. 3, 2018, not January 2018. shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Leave a comment Cancel reply Sign in to comment.

Her remarks to Congress Thursday suggest that the central bank is on track to raise interest rates at its meeting in December, one month before Trumps takes office. She said she has no plans to step down before her four-year term ends on Feb. 3, 2018, reiterated the Fed's political independence and vigorously defended tougher bank regulations established in the wake of the financial crisis. An improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising interest rates, Yellen told Congress' Joint Economic Committee. ___ America's shift to SUVs is on display at L.A. Auto Show America's shift from cars to SUVs is starting to look permanent, and automakers are scrambling to meet the demand. Toyota, Ford, Subaru, Jeep and Volkswagen are all showing new SUVs at this week's Los Angeles Auto Show. Even traditional luxury car makers like Jaguar and Alfa Romeo are debuting SUVs. Americans bought more SUVs than four-door cars for the first time last year, and the momentum is growing. But unlike the previous SUV boom, which fell victim to rising gas prices, this one is likely to stay as automakers offer more small SUVs with better fuel economy. ___ Ex-Valeant, Philidor execs arrested for fraud, conspiracy Former executives of Valeant Pharmaceuticals and a related mail-order pharmacy were charged Thursday with running a fraud-and-kickback scheme that bilked Valeant out of millions of dollars. Their arrests are part of an ongoing investigation, according to Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who said other arrests are possible. Bharara's office said it has charged Gary Tanner, a former Valeant executive, and Andrew Davenport, who had been the chief executive of Philidor, a mail-order pharmacy that is now defunct, with two counts of wire fraud, along with money laundering and conspiracy. ___ Bank stocks surge again, leading broader market higher NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose Thursday as banks resumed their steep upward climb and retailers moved higher. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen emphasized that the Fed plans to raise interest rates, which will help banks make more money from lending. Stocks started the day with small gains and moved higher following Yellen's testimony to Congress. Banks once again marched higher as investors cheered the latest indication that interest rates will rise from their current ultra-low levels. Retailers also rose after strong earnings from Best Buy, while food and household goods makers struggled after weak results from Wal-Mart and J.M. Smucker. ___ Wal-Mart's profit falls but beats estimates; revenue misses NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. saw its third-quarter profit fall more than 8 percent, dragged down as it continues to plow money into e-commerce and improving its stores. While online sales improved, overall revenue fell short of expectations as the company said it was hurt in part by falling food prices. Profit at the world's largest retailer still beat Wall Street expectations, and it lifted the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast. Investors focused on the sales, though, sending shares in the retailer down. ___ Gap's third-quarter profit drops nearly 18 percent NEW YORK (AP) — Gap's third-quarter profit fell nearly 18 percent, undercut by costs related to store closures outside North America. Gap Inc. shares fell in after-market trading Thursday as the company said the slump in the number of people visiting its stores continues as it heads into the critical holiday shopping season. Gap is facing the same problems as other fashion retailers, with shoppers buying less clothing in general and also favoring off-price chains like T.J. Maxx. But Gap is also struggling with identity problems, mired in a slump as its fashions just don't stand out in an overcrowded landscape. ___ JPMorgan Chase to pay $264 million in Chinese bribery case NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. has agreed to pay $264.4 million in fines to federal authorities to settle criminal and civil charges that it hired friends and relatives of Chinese officials in order to gain access to banking deals in that country. JPMorgan's Asia affiliate allegedly created a quid pro quo program that would hire the children and friends of high-ranking Chinese officials, regardless of the person's qualifications, in order to gain favor and win banking deals. ___ Tesla, SolarCity get shareholder approval for merger Tesla Motors got approval from investors to combine with SolarCity Corp. in an effort to expand the market for solar power and give electric car owners new options for solar charging. Shareholders of both companies backed the merger by a wide margin Thursday. The deal, first proposed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk proposed in June, has had more of a mixed reaction on Wall Street. Analysts wondered why Tesla would want to take on SolarCity while busy with its own goals. There were also complaints of a conflict of interest for Musk, who is chairman of both companies. ___ Wells Fargo sees significant slowdown in account openings NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo disclosed signs on Thursday that its customers are significantly pulling back from doing business with the bank, a reverberation of the sales practices scandal that drew a huge fine in September. Because of the timing, its data for October is the first full-picture view of customer reaction and it is not pretty. New customer account openings fell 44 percent in October from a year earlier, while account closures rose 3 percent from the previous year. The bank saw a 50 percent drop in credit card applications. ___ Verizon's AOL cutting 500 jobs, will focus on mobile, video NEW YORK (AP) — AOL is cutting about 500 jobs, or 8 percent of its workforce, as it trims back following some deals and focuses on mobile, video and data. In a memo to employees, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong says the Verizon-owned company has added 1,500 employees over the past year because of acquisitions and partnerships, and it needs to consolidate to improve operations. Armstrong says AOL will add jobs in the areas that are driving growth. ___ Sorry Trump, NY Times says subscriptions rose since election NEW YORK (AP) — The New York Times pushed back against President-elect Donald Trump, saying Thursday that its paid subscriptions have jumped since the election, despite Trump's accusations. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that the Times "is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the 'Trump phenomena.'" The Times said Thursday that it added 41,000 paid subscriptions to its newspaper and digital news products in the week since Election Day. The increase is its largest one-week rise since 2011, when it launched its digital subscription model. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average added 35.68 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 18,903.82. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 10.18 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,187.12. The Nasdaq composite added 39.39 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,333.97. Benchmark U.S. crude slid 15 cents to $45.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slipped 14 cents to $46.49 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.34 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.45 a gallon. Natural gas fell 6 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.70 per 1,000 cubic feet. ___ The first item has been corrected to read that Yellen's term ends on Feb. 3, 2018, not January 2018.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) - A labor union was kept barred from protesting or demonstrating at Wal-Mart’s stores and offices in Arkansas after the state’s highest court on Thursday scaled back a judge’s order prohibiting the group from entering the retail giant’s property for anything other than shopping. The Arkansas Supreme Court upheld a Benton County judge’s trespassing order against the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, but modified the injunction to cover only activities such as picketing, demonstrations and flash mobs against the Bentonville-based company. “We agree with the union that the circuit court’s injunction and declaration encompassing all non-shopping activity or conduct is simply too broad,” the court said in its ruling. The union and its affiliate group, the Organization United for Respect at Wal-Mart, had argued that the National Labor Relations Board, not the Benton County judge, should have jurisdiction over the matter. Justices disagreed and noted that appellate courts in several other states have rejected that argument. “We are pleased at the Arkansas Supreme Court’s decision to narrow the overbroad order,” Randy Parraz, campaign director for the union’s Making Change at Wal-Mart campaign, said in a statement. “Make no mistake, Making Change at Walmart will continue to fight for a better life for the millions of hard-working Walmart employees in every state across this country whose economic struggles have been long forgotten or ignored by Walmart and so many others.” Wal-Mart sued the union over the demonstrations, which it said has included flash mobs where demonstrators have banged on pots and pans and marched and chanted through its stores. Other activities have included rallies and picketing at its stores and offices, the company said. The retail giant has filed similar suits against the union in Florida and Texas in recent years. “We appreciate the court protecting property rights and upholding our right to seek enforcement of the trespass laws against unions in these situations,” Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg said in an email. “As the court’s opinion notes, other states have agreed with this approach.” The union had argued that the company’s trespassing complaint in Arkansas was nearly identical to one it had also filed with the national board. An attorney for Wal-Mart told the court last month that trespassing was a state issue and was properly before the state judge. In a separate opinion, Justice Josephine Linker Hart wrote that she agreed that the original trespassing order was too broad but believed justices should have sent the case back to the lower court rather than rewrite it themselves. “Further, picketing, patrolling, parading, demonstrations, hand-billing and solicitation are all protected activities under the right circumstances,” she wrote. “It behooves this court to return this case to the circuit court where an order that clearly does not run afoul of the National Labor Relations Act can be crafted with the assistance of the litigants.” Filed under: Court, Protest, Union Print Email Gmail Related Supreme Court Rejects Union Challenge to Casino Bankruptcy Arkansas State Student Union Evacuated After Man With Gun Drove Onto Campus State Loses High Court Appeal in Ports Case California Wal-Mart at Center of Labor Dispute to Reopen Wal-Mart Executives Visit Stores for Surprise Promotions Subscribe to the Hamodia print edition More in Business U.K. Treasury Chief: Brexit Uncertainty Could Drag on Economy Wall Street Slips, Led by Healthcare Decline U.S. Stocks Slip as Health Care and Technology Take Losses Volkswagen to Shed 30,000 Jobs, Cutting Costs After Scandal Asian Shares Mixed, Nikkei Up as Yellen Remarks Lift Dollar OP-ED On Seeking Counsel Hillary Clinton Wasn’t The Only Big Election Loser A Common Sense Regulation Where Do We Go From Here?

(CSCO), Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (REGN) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks CSCO, WMT and REGN stock used more than their fair share of red ink on Thursday By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Nov 17, 2016, 4:48 pm EST     Popular Posts: 10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in 2017 The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2016 Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is Just a One-Hit Wonder Recent Posts: Why Gap Inc (GPS), Hibbett Sports, Inc. (HIBB) and First Solar, Inc. (FSLR) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks 5 Retail Stocks That May Not Be Around Next Christmas Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF) Stock Is Beyond All Hope View All Posts It was a stop-and-go effort all session long, but by the time the closing bell rang, the strong housing start data managed to prod stocks meaningfully higher. The S&P 500‘s close of 2,187.12 was 0.47% better than Wednesday’s last trade, and left the index within reach of an all-time high. Thursday wasn’t a fun day for all investors though. Owners of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN), Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) are likely lamenting their results on Thursday. Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Try as he might to get investors focused on the bigger picture rather than last quarter’s results and the near-term revenue outlook, Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins couldn’t stave off the 4.8% hit CSCO shares suffered on Thursday. Last quarter — the company’s first fiscal quarter of the year — Cisco earned 61 cents per share on sales of $12.35 billion. Both numbers topped expectations for income of 59 cents per share and revenue of $12.33 billion. But, the top line fell 2.6% on a year-over-year basis, and the company warned CSCO shareholders that sales would likely fall between 2% and 4% for the quarter currently underway. Robbins explained the company’s transition to a service and software company was a more important consideration for CSCO owners, as that would provide more stable revenue. Investors aren’t entirely convinced the transition is going to be an easy one, however. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) Had Walmart managed to top revenue expectations and missed earnings, investors may have let it slide. With WMT topping revenue and missing sales estimates though, Walmart owners revolted. 7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Are Due for a Reckoning For its third fiscal quarter of 2017, WMT earned 98 cents per share on $118.2 billion. The pros were only calling for a bottom line of 96 cents per share of Walmart, but were also expecting revenue of $118.8 billion. Income isn’t a chief concern for shareholders right now, who understand that Walmart is investing in future growth. With the revenue miss though — in addition to its dialed-back Q3 guidance — investors may be feeling WMT isn’t getting much traction on its competitive efforts Still, e-commerce was a bright spot, and that’s a crucial part of the retailer’s revitalization plan. Digital sales were up nearly 21%. Observers cheered Walmart’s willingness and ability to take on rival Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), but not enough to sidestep the stock’s 3% setback on Thursday. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (REGN) Last but not least, bio pharma company Regeneron Pharmaceuticals watched its stock pull back to the tune of 3.7% today following last night’s news that it and Sanofi SA (ADR) (NYSE:SNY) did not stop a trial of cholesterol-fighting drug Praluent in one of its current studies. It sounds a bit counterintuitive for REGN without the right context, but there’s a rational to the response. There had been some previous chatter that the trial was going so well and demonstrating so much efficacy that the companies wouldn’t even need to complete it as initially described in the trial’s plans. Rather, it would simply take the data it had and present that to the Food and Drug Administration as a completed trial. That’s not going to happen now, however. Rather, REGN and SNY are going to see it through to the end. Investors broadly interpreted that decision as a sign that the drug’s efficacy may not be as wildly superior as once expected. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Election lessons learned RDrop in grocery prices hurts Wal-Mal profit margins Chain did see gain on online sales after buying Jet.com Video Photo Bloomberg A Wal-Mart tractor trailer truck departs the company’s distribution center in Washington, Utah. By Shannon Pettypiece, Bloomberg News Nov 17, 2016 at 3:17 pm | Print View Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s brick-and-mortar sales fell short of expectations last quarter, even as its acquisition of internet start-up Jet.com gave a much-needed jolt to e-commerce orders. Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.2 percent in the third quarter, the company said in a statement Thursday. That was just shy of the 1.3 percent predicted by analysts and marked a slowdown from the previous quarter. Total revenue also missed estimates, hurt in part by currency headwinds. The sluggish sales raised concerns for investors, despite Wal-Mart coming through on its pledge to energize its e-commerce business. Wal-Mart’s $3 billion purchase of Jet.com in September helped fuel a 21 percent gain in online sales last quarter, an acceleration from the 12 percent gain in the second quarter. But at its physical stores, a historic streak of food deflation put pressure on the chain. Grocery prices across the country have dropped on a year-over-year basis for 10 straight months, a streak of deflation not seen since 1960. That’s been good for consumers, but it’s brought headaches to Wal-Mart, the largest seller of groceries in the United States. Eggs and beef have grown especially cheap, making competition fiercer between supermarkets. The run of deflation has squeezed profit margins and sent shares of some low-cost chains tumbling. “We are not satisfied,” CEO Doug McMillon said in the statement. “We will continue to change and pick up speed to reach our longer-term aspirations.” Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said it is too early to tell how the incoming Donald Trump administration will affect its business. The president-elect’s pledge to renegotiate trade deals with Mexico and China could have a major impact on Wal-Mart, which imports many of its products from China and has a large business in Mexico. Since taking the helm in 2014, McMillon has boosted pay for U.S. workers, tried to improve Wal-Mart’s grocery quality and spent billions on its online operations — aiming to gain ground on Amazon.com Inc. He also is pushing to lower Wal-Mart’s prices, clean up stores and take better care of customers. Your next Nation & World articles Zuckerberg offers plan for Facebook to f ...

(AP) — A labor union was kept barred from protesting or demonstrating at Wal-Mart's stores and offices in Arkansas after the state's highest court on Thursday scaled back a judge's order prohibiting the group from entering the retail giant's property for anything other than shopping. The Arkansas Supreme Court upheld a Benton County judge's trespassing order against the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, but modified the injunction to cover only activities such as picketing, demonstrations and flash mobs against the Bentonville-based company. "We agree with the union that the circuit court's injunction and declaration encompassing all non-shopping activity or conduct is simply too broad," the court said in its ruling. Story continues below video × The union and its affiliate group, the Organization United for Respect at Wal-Mart, had argued that the National Labor Relations Board, not the Benton County judge, should have jurisdiction over the matter. Justices disagreed and noted that appellate courts in several other states have rejected that argument. "We are pleased at the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision to narrow the overbroad order," Randy Parraz, campaign director for the union's Making Change at Wal-Mart campaign, said in a statement. "Make no mistake, Making Change at Walmart will continue to fight for a better life for the millions of hard-working Walmart employees in every state across this country whose economic struggles have been long forgotten or ignored by Walmart and so many others." Wal-Mart sued the union over the demonstrations, which it said has included flash mobs where demonstrators have banged on pots and pans and marched and chanted through its stores. Other activities have included rallies and picketing at its stores and offices, the company said. The retail giant has filed similar suits against the union in Florida and Texas in recent years. "We appreciate the court protecting property rights and upholding our right to seek enforcement of the trespass laws against unions in these situations," Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg said in an email. "As the court's opinion notes, other states have agreed with this approach." The union had argued that the company's trespassing complaint in Arkansas was nearly identical to one it had also filed with the national board. An attorney for Wal-Mart told the court last month that trespassing was a state issue and was properly before the state judge. In a separate opinion, Justice Josephine Linker Hart wrote that she agreed that the original trespassing order was too broad but believed justices should have sent the case back to the lower court rather than rewrite it themselves. "Further, picketing, patrolling, parading, demonstrations, hand-billing and solicitation are all protected activities under the right circumstances," she wrote. "It behooves this court to return this case to the circuit court where an order that clearly does not run afoul of the National Labor Relations Act can be crafted with the assistance of the litigants." ___ Follow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ademillo Tags Business General News Labor Issues Social Issues Social Affairs Industry Regulation Government Business And Finance Government And Politics Government Regulations Protests And Demonstrations Legal Proceedings Law And Order Political And Civil Unrest Courts Judiciary Local Governments State Governments Locations Arkansas United States North America loading...

Asit Sharma (TMFfinosus) Nov 17, 2016 at 3:20PM Grocery-aisle pricing pressured Wal-Mart's fiscal third-quarter 2017 results. Image source: Getty Images. Macroeconomic trends are starting to get a few hooks into the performance of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT). The global retail and grocery behemoth reported a rather static top-line result in fiscal third-quarter 2017 earnings, released Thursday before the markets opened. After reviewing the report's key raw numbers, we'll examine why economic conditions constrained the company's fiscal third quarter. Wal-Mart results: The raw numbers Metric Q3 2017 Q3 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $118.2 billion $117.4 billion 0.7% Net income from continuing operations $3.03 billion $3.3 billion (8.1)% Diluted EPS $0.98 $1.03 8% Data source: Wal-Mart Stores 8-K filing. What happened with Wal-Mart this quarter? The very slight improvement in total revenue was a function of lighter-than-expected Wal-Mart U.S. sales growth of 2.5%, to $74.6 billion. Wal-Mart U.S. recorded a comparable-sales increase of just 1.7%, which management attributed to the impact of grocery deflation. The macroeconomic trend of deflation may persist in coming quarters. Excess farming supply of dairy, meat, and vegetables, combined with a strong U.S. dollar (which curbs U.S. food export demand), has resulted in lower basic food-commodities costs for grocery chains this year. Yet grocers tend to competitively lower their retail prices in these environments in an attempt to grab market share. Passing on price savings is splendid for customers, but the discounting crimps recorded sales, as Wal-Mart demonstrated this quarter. Wal-Mart's smaller-format Neighborhood Market stores, which are one-fifth the size of a typical supercenter, booked a healthy comparative sales increase of 5.2%. While Wal-Mart International's recorded revenue fell nearly 5%, to $28.4 billion, the international segment achieved growth of 2.4% after adjusting for currency effects. Wage increases, investments in technology, and currency translation pushed operating income down 10.4%. The company pointed out that after adjusting for a one-time lease accounting benefit last year, the comparable operating-income drop was closer to 8%. Wal-Mart's e-commerce business continued to post rapid growth, as online sales surged 20.6%. The company has recently directed substantial resources to pushing its non-brick-and-mortar revenue forward. For example, Wal-Mart closed its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com during the quarter, on Sept. 16. Sam's Club revenue increased just 1.1% to $14.2 billion. Again, management cited grocery deflation as a limiting factor on sales growth. What management had to say CEO Doug McMillon touched on a few significant business trends in the company's quarterly 8-K filing: We had a solid third quarter. Our e-commerce growth accelerated, operations in the U.S. continued to strengthen and international delivered another solid performance. We are pleased that we can see real progress stemming from our strategic choices and we appreciate the great work by our associates. Yet, we are not satisfied. We will continue to change and pick up speed to reach our longer term aspirations. We're positioned well for this important fourth quarter and wish everyone a happy, peaceful and prosperous holiday season. There are a few specific takeaways to unpack in this seemingly general statement. McMillon implicitly refers to the international segment's currency-adjusted growth. On a currency-neutral basis, global operations grew faster than those in the U.S. this quarter. He also obliquely applauds the wage increases the company has undertaken ("strategic choices"), and their positive effects on employees. Finally, McMillon signals that the company feels optimistic about its traditional targeted slate of shopping deals for the upcoming holiday period. And of course, a prosperous holiday season for consumers will translate into a prosperous fiscal fourth quarter for Wal-Mart. Moving forward Wal-Mart raised its full fiscal-year earnings guidance in Thursday's release. Management now expects 2017 earnings per share to fall between $4.34 and $4.49, versus a previous projection of between $4.29 and $4.49. Executives also boosted adjusted earnings per share slightly, from a previous band of between $4.15 and $4.35, to a new range of $4.20 to $4.35. As it looks to close out an eventful year, Wal-Mart is highlighting its progress on optimizing working capital. By lengthening accounts payable days (i.e., slowing vendor payments), controlling receivables collections, and cycling inventory faster, the company has improved operating and free cash flow considerably so far this year: Image source: Wal-Mart Stores investor presentation. The table above shows a substantial year-to-date increase of $4.6 billion in operating cash flow, or about 31% higher cash from operations versus the prior-year period. A slight decrease in capital expenditure has pushed year-to-date free cash flow to $5.4 billion. Wal-Mart has put its cash excess to work by more than tripling share repurchases this year, to $6.3 billion in the first nine months of 2016. This generation of handsome cash flow will likely remain one of management's talking points, as it attempts to spur sales momentum at the outset of a new fiscal year.

Wal-Mart results: The raw numbers Metric Q3 2017 Q3 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $118.2 billion $117.4 billion 0.7% Net income from continuing operations $3.03 billion $3.3 billion (8.1)% Diluted EPS $0.98 $1.03 8% Data source: Wal-Mart Stores 8-K filing. What happened with Wal-Mart this quarter? The very slight improvement in total revenue was a function of lighter-than-expected Wal-Mart U.S. sales growth of 2.5%, to $74.6 billion. Wal-Mart U.S. recorded a comparable-sales increase of just 1.7%, which management attributed to the impact of grocery deflation. The macroeconomic trend of deflation may persist in coming quarters. Excess farming supply of dairy, meat, and vegetables, combined with a strong U.S. dollar (which curbs U.S. food export demand), has resulted in lower basic food-commodities costs for grocery chains this year. Yet grocers tend to competitively lower their retail prices in these environments in an attempt to grab market share. Passing on price savings is splendid for customers, but the discounting crimps recorded sales, as Wal-Mart demonstrated this quarter. Wal-Mart's smaller-format Neighborhood Market stores, which are one-fifth the size of a typical supercenter, booked a healthy comparative sales increase of 5.2%. While Wal-Mart International's recorded revenue fell nearly 5%, to $28.4 billion, the international segment achieved growth of 2.4% after adjusting for currency effects. Wage increases, investments in technology, and currency translation pushed operating income down 10.4%. The company pointed out that after adjusting for a one-time lease accounting benefit last year, the comparable operating-income drop was closer to 8%. Wal-Mart's e-commerce business continued to post rapid growth, as online sales surged 20.6%. The company has recently directed substantial resources to pushing its non-brick-and-mortar revenue forward. For example, Wal-Mart closed its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com during the quarter, on Sept. 16. Sam's Club revenue increased just 1.1% to $14.2 billion. Again, management cited grocery deflation as a limiting factor on sales growth. What management had to say CEO Doug McMillon touched on a few significant business trends in the company's quarterly 8-K filing: We had a solid third quarter. Our e-commerce growth accelerated, operations in the U.S. continued to strengthen and international delivered another solid performance. We are pleased that we can see real progress stemming from our strategic choices and we appreciate the great work by our associates. Yet, we are not satisfied. We will continue to change and pick up speed to reach our longer term aspirations. We're positioned well for this important fourth quarter and wish everyone a happy, peaceful and prosperous holiday season. There are a few specific takeaways to unpack in this seemingly general statement. McMillon implicitly refers to the international segment's currency-adjusted growth. On a currency-neutral basis, global operations grew faster than those in the U.S. this quarter. He also obliquely applauds the wage increases the company has undertaken ("strategic choices"), and their positive effects on employees. Finally, McMillon signals that the company feels optimistic about its traditional targeted slate of shopping deals for the upcoming holiday period. And of course, a prosperous holiday season for consumers will translate into a prosperous fiscal fourth quarter for Wal-Mart. Moving forward Wal-Mart raised its full fiscal-year earnings guidance in Thursday's release. Management now expects 2017 earnings per share to fall between $4.34 and $4.49, versus a previous projection of between $4.29 and $4.49. Executives also boosted adjusted earnings per share slightly, from a previous band of between $4.15 and $4.35, to a new range of $4.20 to $4.35. As it looks to close out an eventful year, Wal-Mart is highlighting its progress on optimizing working capital. By lengthening accounts payable days (i.e., slowing vendor payments), controlling receivables collections, and cycling inventory faster, the company has improved operating and free cash flow considerably so far this year: Image source: Wal-Mart Stores investor presentation. The table above shows a substantial year-to-date increase of $4.6 billion in operating cash flow, or about 31% higher cash from operations versus the prior-year period. A slight decrease in capital expenditure has pushed year-to-date free cash flow to $5.4 billion. Wal-Mart has put its cash excess to work by more than tripling share repurchases this year, to $6.3 billion in the first nine months of 2016. This generation of handsome cash flow will likely remain one of management's talking points, as it attempts to spur sales momentum at the outset of a new fiscal year.

Asian shares mixed, Nikkei up as Yellen remarks lift dollar Marley Jay / The Associated Press November 17, 2016 09:37 AM HONG KONG - Japanese shares rose Friday on the yen's weakness while other Asian benchmarks wobbled after Fed chair Janet Yellen signalled that policymakers intend to raise interest rates soon. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.8 per cent to 18,011.79 as the yen hit a six-month low, helping shares of the country's big exporters. South Korea's Kospi shed 0.4 per cent to 1,972.64 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.3 per cent to 22,318.47. The Shanghai Composite slipped 0.1 per cent to 3,206.64 while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 crept up 0.2 per cent to 5,347.30. Benchmarks in Taiwan and Indonesia fell while Singapore's rose. RATE HORIZON: In remarks to Congress, Yellen suggested the U.S. central bank is on track to raise interest rates when policymakers hold their final meeting of the year in December. She said the improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising rates, in comments that increased certainty for investors. The Fed raised its key interest rate in December 2015 but it's still at ultralow levels that have fueled a multiyear global stock market boom. Economists forecast rates will go up by a quarter-point in December followed by two more hikes in 2017. MARKET INSIGHT: "The greatest uncertainties, namely the election and the Fed rate hike, were significantly reduced over the last two weeks, which gave the market a good reason to refocus on the fundamentals of economic and corporate earnings," said Margaret Yang, an analyst at CMC Markets. CURRENCIES: The greenback rallied on the prospect of U.S. higher interest rates. The dollar climbed to 110.60 yen — its highest since the end of May — from 110.17 yen in late trading Thursday. The euro fell to its lowest in nearly a year, sinking to $1.0597 from $1.0614. WALL STREET: The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.2 per cent to 18,903.82. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.5 per cent to 2,187.12. The Nasdaq composite added 0.7 per cent to 5,333.97. ENERGY: Oil extended its decline. Benchmark U.S. crude futures slid 54 cents to $44.88 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 15 cents to settle at $45.42 a barrel on Thursday. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slipped 43 cents to $46.69 a barrel in London. © Copyright Times Colonist Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

About 20,000 people, or a fifth of the workforce at the company’s 400-plus stores in China, have joined groups on WeChat to organise protests against the retailer. PHOTO: THE NEW YORK TIMES mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 4:00 AM, November 18, 2016 SHENZHEN — In a one-man war room in his apartment, a laid-off Walmart employee named Wang Shishu was tapping out a message on his phone to a group of workers and plotting his next move. During the past few months, Mr Wang, 56, has helped organise a national movement in China against Walmart. Labour strikes have hit stores in the south simultaneously. There have been boycotts in the north-east. And, in Shenzhen, where Walmart opened its first outlet in China two decades ago, employees have filed a lawsuit demanding back pay. “We want a snowball effect,” said Mr Wang in the booming baritone of a street preacher. “We want everybody to know what to do next.” As the Chinese economy has slowed, strikes and labour protests have broken out across the country, mostly scattered episodes targeting a single factory or business. The government has responded aggressively, detaining activists and increasing censorship to keep unrest from spreading. But activism against Walmart’s more than 400 stores in China in recent months has followed a different pattern: Workers in several cities agitating against the same company, bypassing official unions controlled by the Communist Party and using social media to coordinate their actions — while the authorities largely stand aside. Across China, Walmart employees have raised their fists at protests, chanting: “Workers, stand up!” They have appealed to local officials with patriotic fervour, invoking the struggles of Mao Zedong against foreign imperialists. They have posted screeds online against unkind bosses and “union puppets”. In doing so, the Chinese workforce of the world’s largest retail chain has put the ruling Communist Party in an uncomfortable position, publicly testing its Marxist commitment to defend the working class and pitting that against its fear of independent labour activism. Ever since the Solidarity trade union helped topple communist rule in Poland, Beijing has sought to prevent the emergence of a nationwide labour movement, suppressing efforts by workers to organise across industries or localities. But the authorities appear to be hesitating in the case of Walmart, whose workers have complained of low wages and a new scheduling system they say has left them poorer and exhausted. In recent months, as many as 20,000 people, about a fifth of the company’s work force in China, have joined messaging groups set up by Mr Wang and other activists on WeChat, a popular app. In these forums, they vent about company policies, share protest slogans and discuss plans to coordinate demonstrations for maximum effect. Mr Wang, a former customer service representative, who Walmart has fired twice, spends his days babysitting his granddaughter and trading messages with workers across the country, often as late as 2am. “What they’re doing is inhumane,” he said. “I want Walmart to return to the sympathetic company it used to be.” Mr Eli Friedman, a labour scholar at Cornell University, said the Walmart movement was “probably the most substantive example of sustained, cross-workplace, independent worker organising we’ve ever seen in China’s private sector”. The government appears to be keeping a distance because it is worried about provoking a backlash, or about acting on behalf of a prominent American company against Chinese workers at a time when nationalism in China is rising. But by doing little, or nothing, it risks encouraging disaffected workers elsewhere, especially at the growing number of national chain businesses with operations across China. Already, workers at Neutrogena stores and China Unicom, a state-owned telecom operator, have used similar tactics, while avoiding serious punishment. “We can only expect that online organising will continue to break down local barriers,” said Mr Keegan Elmer, a researcher for China Labour Bulletin, an advocacy group based in Hong Kong. Chinese law requires businesses to establish labour unions, but they are almost always controlled by management, and companies generally use the unions to contain worker activism. In the face of labour strife, some businesses have offered back pay, bonuses and other benefits to workers. But others, concerned that labour activism could force costly concessions, have resorted to tougher tactics, retaliating against those who help organise protests. At Walmart, some of the most vocal workers have been deprived of raises, reassigned, or in some cases fired, according to interviews with more than a dozen employees. Much of the discontent stems from a new scheduling system that Walmart put in place this summer. The company says the system is a way of giving workers more flexibility. Workers have argued that it has resulted in cuts to overtime pay and excessively long shifts, and some say they were coerced into signing new contracts agreeing to the system. Walmart denied that it had treated its employees unfairly or had pressured them to accept the new schedules. Ms Rebecca Lui, a spokeswoman, said the vast majority of its workforce supported the new system, and that employees were free to keep their old schedules. “Our associates are our most valuable asset,” she said in a statement. Ms Zhai Xiuhua, a former greeter at a Walmart store in Shenzhen, said she was fired in September after leading a fight against the new scheduling system. “I told them, ‘Even if you put a knife to my neck, I’ll never agree’,” she recalled at her home, where her uniform and identification badge — No 14470 — still hang on the wall. Ms Zhai, who is worried about medical bills, says she now hopes to find work in her hometown in the south-western province of Sichuan. Walmart, which has resisted unionisation at its thousands of stores across the world, was forced by the government in 2006 to establish branches of the Communist Party-controlled All-China Federation of Trade Unions for its roughly 100,000 Chinese employees, part of a broader push by the party to unionise foreign businesses. But union branches at many Walmart stores are under the thumb of store managers, and higher-level union officials appear torn about how to respond to complaints from workers such as Ms Zhai. Labour activists at Walmart have cited the ideals of President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party’s history of protecting workers, and experts said they appeared to be benefiting from a belief among some officials that the influence of foreign companies such as Walmart should be curtailed. “If the Chinese authorities try to suppress the workers on behalf of Walmart,” said Mr Wang Jiangsong, a Chinese labour scholar, “it will hurt the country’s image.” When Walmart opened its first store in China in 1996, workers rushed to snap up jobs that paid more than those at Chinese competitors. Now, some employees say, a Walmart job does not pay enough to comfortably support a family, with wages hovering around the minimum wage, or about US$300 (S$425) a month. While Walmart has led a high-profile campaign in the United States to raise pay, salaries in China have remained largely stagnant, said workers, barely keeping pace with inflation. Walmart has struggled to keep up with the fast-changing tastes of Chinese consumers and tried to re-energise its business by making investments in online retailers. But the continuing labour unrest poses a potential hurdle. Ms You Tianyu, 45, a customer service employee at a Walmart store in Shenzhen, caught the attention of her supervisors in August when she wrote a letter to the president of Walmart, Mr Doug McMillon, to complain about the company’s efforts to silence aggrieved workers. Ms You said her bosses now harassed her daily because she spoke out, and she has received a diagnosis of anxiety and depression. She spends most of her non-working hours rummaging through a mess of worker manifestoes, union laws and pay slips in her tiny apartment, hoping to find a new line of attack against Walmart. “I’m on the verge of collapsing,” she said. “I don’t know how much longer I’ll last.” THE NEW YORK TIMES mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most World READ COMMENTED ‘Zombie’ birds fall from sky in Moscow ‘You’re fat’ card prompts London police action ‘Wrong way down the highway’ driver arrested after US crash that killed six ‘Worse than loan sharks’, Pua says of 1MDB paying US$993m for US$3.5b bond guarantee ‘World’s longest flight’ lands in Auckland ‘Post-truth’ named Oxford Dictionaries word of the year Zimbabwean anti-government activists shot at, beaten, abducted Yemeni government says not interested in Kerry's truce announcement Yemen's Houthis say they want to end war, form unity government Yemen air strike kills 14 in attack on fuel trucks: medics, residents Wounded, hungry, determined to stay: life in the line of fire in Mosul World leaders must heed people’s economic fears: Obama Workers laying roads in southern India rescued from debt bondage With Trump win, China looks to seize Asia free trade leadership WHO declares end of Zika emergency but says virus remains a threat Inside Today World Syrian family, pupils among dozens killed in Aleppo attacks High turnout at French conservative primaries, organizer says In Mali, waning fortunes of Fulani herders play into Islamist hands Three bombs explode at supermarket in Yangon, no dead or injured Italy's Renzi gets backing in referendum from singers, athletes, chef Business Trump to be held to his word on Fed independence: Bullard Deutsche nominates chairman for second term, clears him of Libor blame: source Volkswagen CEO says sees case for building own battery factory: paper China pledges further opening as leaders scramble for free trade New Zealand's Key says China will fill trade void left by U.S. Sports Singapore wants to drop F1 race, says Ecclestone Hafiz pays tribute to S’pore team-mates after seeing red Why We Run: Banker braving extremes to challenge his limits Suzuki Cup: Backs to the wall, Lions defy odds to earn point Schooling stars as Team Singapore athletes enjoy day out at Istana Entertainment Monroe’s ‘Happy Birthday Mr. President’ gown sold for almost S$7m Bollywood actress Mallika Sherawat attacked in Paris Five reasons why you should watch Legend Of The Blue Sea Got a film idea to share with Eric Khoo or Kelvin Tong?

Sports Photos Faces in Places Arts Around The Area People In Society Spotlight on Wicomico Social Lounge Beefed Up Shopping Patrol Turned Down By County Nov 17,2016 by Charlene Sharpe SNOW HILL – Deputies from the Worcester County Sheriff’s Department will not be providing extra patrols at Walmart this holiday season following a recent decision by county leaders. On Tuesday the Worcester County Commissioners voted 5-2 against approving a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that would have allowed deputies to perform extra patrols at Walmart on Black Friday and Christmas. “I’ve been on the record as not in favor of any MOUs with anybody,” Commissioner Jim Bunting said. “I don’t think our sheriff’s department should be security.” Lieutenant Mark Bowen approached the commissioners seeking approval of the MOU, which outlined the time periods the extra patrols would occur, the rate Walmart would pay and the fact that the deputies would be on-duty and under the supervision of the sheriff during that time. Bowen said Walmart would be charged $75 per hour per deputy, as that was the rate that had been set by the county. Commissioner Joe Mitrecic questioned whether $75 an hour would cover the cost, considering deputies were paid overtime on holidays. “I want to make sure we’re not going to be double-paying and only charge time-and-a-half to Walmart,” he said. Stacey Norton, the county’s human resources director, explained that the deputies who did the work would be given alternate days off to make up for working on the holidays and therefore would be paid the regular overtime rate. Commissioner Chip Bertino asked who would be performing the patrols. Bowen explained the task would be given to whoever volunteered for it. “Everybody has a fair chance,” he said. “Nobody’s forced to do it. It’s all volunteer.” Bertino also wanted to know whether the sheriff’s department performed this type of work for other area businesses. Bowen said they were free to ask. “We’ve done Walmart in the past and they liked the service,” he said. Commissioner Ted Elder asked whether the $75 rate would cover the cost of overtime if a member of the command staff volunteered. “I don’t foresee anybody in the command staff signing up to work at Walmart,” Bowen said. Bunting pointed out that the sheriff’s department had road patrols out every day of the year. He asked whether they could simply circle the Walmart parking lot during their normal patrols. Bowen said Walmart officials specifically wanted to have a deputy there. “I think there are too many questions here,” Mitrecic said. Commissioners Diana Purnell and Bud Church were the only two to vote in support of the MOU. ← Previous Next → 0 shares0000 About The Author: Charlene Sharpe Charlene Sharpe has been with The Dispatch since 2014.

But in the battle between Walmart and Visa, nuances are few and far between. Visa is offering $10 to anyone in Manitoba who buys groceries using their Visa card. Walmart stopped accepting Visa as of Oct. 24 in the province. So the credit card company wants to hit the retail giant where it hurts most: food retailing. Walmart intends to become the No. 1 food retailer in Canada, as it is in the U.S. But the Canadian food distribution landscape is much different. Just three major companies feed most Canadians: Loblaws, Sobeys and Metro. So this may take a while. Walmart and Costco have made great strides in the marketplace in recent years. The companies have a combined market share of nearly 20 per cent. Walmart capitalized on Target’s abrupt retreat from Canada to strengthen, particularly in Quebec and British Columbia. Nurturing food shopping habits is at the core of Walmart’s insurgence. In fact, it’s successfully converting same-store sales into more food purchases. Walmart works because it uses analytics to support of its impressive logistical capacity, making margins much easier to control. That’s where Visa comes in. Earlier this year, Walmart vowed to stop accepting Visa at its more than 400 Canadian outlets because it believed Visa’s transaction fees were too high. At last report, however, Walmart has only implemented its Visa ban in Manitoba and Thunder Bay, Ont., and sales results in the wake of the ban have been discouraging. Nevertheless, Walmart apparently intends to continue to bully the credit card company. Visa, meanwhile, is casting itself as a protector of consumers and is encouraging them to support retailers who accept Visa. It doesn’t mention Walmart in its Manitoba campaign, but we all know what this is about. And Visa picked food, of all products, as its campaign focus. That’s telling. Visa, too, is a data-driven enterprise. And it needs the vast market information from card use at Walmart stores to get a comprehensive sense of the marketplace. Walmart’s boycott of Visa hurts the credit card company’s bottom line and denies it access to massive market data that’s critical to its ability to operate. Walmart has enough power to re-channel how consumers use credit to buy almost anything. But converting consumers to other credit sources will take time, so Walmart is going slow in pushing Visa out of its stores. Banks, which are heavily invested in the credit card business, stand to lose millions if these two companies part ways. That’s not a scenario Visa wants to think about. Worse, if Walmart wins and gets to pay lower transaction fees to credit card suppliers, Loblaws, Sobeys and Metro will likely ask for similar fee reductions. Other smaller retailers will follow suit. So it’s not surprising to see how Visa has responded to Walmart’s boycott, since the stakes are huge. Food industry battles aren’t new. But Visa bribing consumers so they make food purchases anywhere but at Walmart is likely a first in Canada. And certainly Walmart is not without fault. But the company has been successful because it understands the data game. The end result could be a change in how credit is used to buy food and how grocers support customers looking for more loyalty rewards. Walmart is making the normally obscure credit world very public. And Visa is making a political statement. Consumers who use credit cards to purchase food either want extra goodies beyond what retailers provide or, regrettably, lack other financial options. Visa is desperately trying to use both circumstances to its advantage. Certainly the battle lacks subtlety. That probably means the company with the most clout – Walmart – will be the winner.

He his accused of exposing himself and performing a lewd act in front of a woman in the parking lot (Courtesy: Troy Police Department). TROY, Ohio (WDTN) – A Harrison Township firefighter is charged with performing a lewd act on himself in the Troy Walmart parking lot. On Nov. 7, a woman was in the parking lot of Walmart when she saw a silver Chevy Impala, whose driver is later identified as Keith Bousquette, pull into a parking space near her — one space away, according to a Troy Police report. The woman saw Bousquette expose and perform a sex act on himself while parked next to the woman, who was sitting in her vehicle. The woman took a picture of Bousquette’s vehicle near her — not of the act — and sent it to her husband, who later came to the Walmart parking lot. When the woman’s husband arrived, that’s when Bousquette drove away and took the interstate, according to the report. Police were able to make contact with Bousquette who told them that he thought the woman in the vehicle was someone he knew and “exposed himself as a joke” but it “turned out that it was not” his friend, according to the police report. Bousquette is listed as a firefighter on the Harrison Township Fire Department’s website as a firefighter and paramedic who has been with the department since Jan. 22, 2008. He is expected to appear in court at 8 a.m. Nov. 22. Share this: Tweet Email Print More Share on Tumblr Like this: Like Loading...

Jim Cramer Rhonda Schaffler Nov 17, 2016 1:20 PM EST Walmart's ( WMT)  earnings report shouldn't surprise investors, said the TheStreet's Jim Cramer. The company's CEO has already explained that this year the focus is on investment, Cramer noted. Cramer said he is giving the retailer a pass on its latest earnings report. He thinks Walmart's recent acquisition of Jet.com will help it better compete against Amazon ( AMZN) . In its latest quarter, Walmart reported a drop in profits, and revenue gains were less than some on Wall Street expected.

DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today Walmart (WMT) Delivers 'Okay' Q3 Results, Raymond James' Bugatch Says Walmart (WMT) reported an earnings beat and revenue miss for the 2017 third quarter this morning. Natalie Walters Nov 17, 2016 1:12 PM EST NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Walmart  (WMT) were lower in early afternoon trading Thursday, after the discount superstore reported a revenue miss for the 2017 third quarter before today's opening bell.  Walmart's quarterly revenue rose by 0.7% year-over-year to $118.2 billion, but missed expectations of $118.8 billion. Earnings came in at 98 cents per share, topping estimates for 96 cents per share.  "I think the quarter was an okay quarter," Raymond James managing director Budd Bugatch said on BloombergTV's "Bloomberg Daybreak: Americas" today. The firm has a "buy" rating and $80 price target on the stock.  Walmart is clearly still trying to improve the customer experience in its stores and to accelerate its e-commerce business, he noted. "The results tell you that strategy is intact."  For the stock to make a U-turn and go up, Walmart would have needed to report better same-store sales, Bugatch noted. Walmart's same-store sales increased by 1.2% year-over-year, vs. estimates for a 1.3% increase. "That's the disappointment this morning." In order to know that Walmart is improving the customer experience in its stores, you have to look at the "numbers of the inventory," he said. "Inventory was actually down. Comp inventory in the U.S. was down, yet in-stock was up. And that's kind of what you look at." Walmart agreed to purchase e-commerce giant Jet.com in August for $3.3. billion, but it's "much too early" to say whether that deal is working or not, Bugatch commented.   Separately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its "risk-adjusted" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author.

 How Target, Walmart, and Amazon are facing the ultimate challenge on the biggest shopping days of the year Hayley Peterson Nov. 17, 2016, 1:09 PM 3,664 facebook linkedin twitter email print REUTERS/Jonathan Alcorn Retailers spend all year gearing up for this moment: the launch of the all-important holiday shopping season. The months of November and December are the most critical time of the year in retail, accounting for as much as 30% of annual sales for many retailers, according to the National Retail Federation. Shoppers are expected to spend $655.8 billion in the two-month period this year, an 3.6% increase over last year's spending, according to the NRF. Online sales are forecast to grow between 7% and 10% over last year to as much as $117 billion. That means a website glitch — even if it lasts only a couple minutes — or running out of stock on a popular item can cost companies millions of dollars in lost sales. For that reason, retailers work hard all year long to get the holidays right. For Walmart, Target, and Amazon, that has meant overhauling websites and shopping apps, speeding up shipping, and using predictive analytics to try and determine the right amount of product to stock up on for the busy holiday season. Target last year broke a record in online sales on Thanksgiving, so it has been focused over the last year on ensuring that its website works seamlessly during the high-traffic holiday period. Target The company says it has made "dramatic" changes to Target.com to speed up the checkout process and to make it function more fluidly across desktop computers, tablets, and smart phones. It also widened its toy selection by 15% over last year, since the holiday season accounts for 50% of Target's toy sales. "We’ve made back-end platform changes that are designed to enhance day-to-day functionality — from account management to checkout — and build more capacity and flexibility as we head into the holiday season," Target spokesman Eddie Baeb said. The company has also made significant changes to speed up shipping for online orders. Specifically, Target doubled the number of stores that are able to ship orders, bringing the total number of shipping-enabled stores to 1,000 out of Target's 1,800 locations nationwide. With this change, Target's stores are now expected to fulfill more than half of the retailer's holiday orders, executives said. Thanksgiving Day holiday shoppers line up with television sets on discount at the Target retail store in Chicago, Illinois, November 28, 2013. REUTERS/Jeff Haynes This not only cuts down on shipping times for customers, but it also reduces costs for Target because the packages don't have to travel as far. "With this increase, Target will be able to fulfill more orders, spread workload and improve average ship times during the holidays," Baeb said. Walmart meanwhile has been heavily focused on expanding the breadth of products it offers online. The company has more than doubled its online assortment to 20 million products since last year, and "millions of additional items are scheduled to be added in the coming months," the company said. To prevent customers from getting overwhelmed by all the new products, Walmart made improvements to its "recommendation engine," which so far has led to a 20% increase in customer engagement with  items the website recommends.  It has also built a new software called Electrode that helps its web pages load 33% faster, according to Walmart. AP But Walmart doesn't just want its website to be fast: it needs to prevent crashes, as well. The company says it expects about 10 times its normal traffic rates on Walmart.com from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday. So the retailer built software called OneOps that makes it possible to handle peak traffic on Walmart.com across several clouds — versus a single cloud — to avoid downtime on the site. To make sure it works properly, Walmart has been stress-testing the website in the last several weeks by hitting it with traffic that well exceeds expectations during the holidays. Walmart is also trying to cut down on shipping times this year after doubling  its number of online fulfillment centers — which are responsible for packing and shipping online orders — from five warehouses last year to 10 this year.  Customers can also choose to pick up online orders in stores. Last year, the company received up to five times as many same-day pickup orders during the holiday period compared to a normal week. So Walmart is staffing up its store teams responsible for helping customers with online pickup, and for the first time, adding dedicated "pickup" managers to every store. Amazon has also been adding to its staff to handle holiday demand. The retailer this year hired 120,000 temporary workers for the holidays, up 20% from the 100,000 workers it hired during the period last year. Amazon's holiday preparation this year has also been focused on improving its mobile app to make shopping and in-store price comparisons easier.  An Amazon warehouse. Sean Gallup/Getty Images For example, the company expanded the assortment of barcodes that shoppers can scan to compare prices in stores to those on Amazon. The app is also offering a tool again this year called "watch a deal" that alerts shoppers to specific holiday deals whenever they become available. According to the company, seven in 10 Amazon customers shopped using a mobile device last holiday season. As Target, Walmart, Amazon, and others prepare for the rush holiday orders, delivery companies are readying for an influx in packages. The United States Postal Service is expected to deliver 750 million packages this holiday season, or 5 million packages per day – a 12% increase from the 670 million delivered during the period last year. The United Parcel Service will ship another 700 million packages over the same period, which is a 16% increase from the previous year.

Ahold Delhaize, the Dutch-Belgian retailer that runs U.S. supermarket chains Stop & Shop, Giant, Hannaford and Food Lion, among others, earlier reported a 4.3 percent rise in third-quarter underlying operating income, to 513 million euros ($549 million) but missed analyst expectations due to its U.S. performance. CEO Dick Boer said in an interview that the stores most feeling the pinch were its Food Lion shops, of which there are 1,100 situated in Southern U.S. states. "During the second and third quarter, there was aggressive pricing from Wal-Mart, it's well known in the market, and of course we had to follow to keep our competitive position," he said. For several years, Food Lion has been cutting prices, emphasizing fresh produce and remodelling stores to make them easier for customers to navigate and find on-sale items. Boer noted that despite price deflation of nearly 1.5 percent in the areas where Food Lion, the core of Delhaize's U.S. business, competes, the chain had grown sales by 1.3 percent in the past recent quarter, which he said was evidence of its resilience. The division's growth on a like for like basis however was down from 1.6 percent in the same period a year ago, and operating margins fell to 3.5 percent from 3.8 percent. Boer said Ahold Delhaize is keenly aware of the ongoing U.S. expansion of German retailer Aldi, and plans by another German discount chain, Lidl, to open stores on the U.S. East Coast. "For sure, every competitor coming into a market is, for us, and for everyone I think, a signal to be more alert than before," he said. "Aldi is known in the markets, clearly we have seen them continue to grow in the markets where we operate." He cited the Philadelphia area as an example. "So that's what drives also I think the actions of Wal-Mart in the Southern states, to be sure that with the discounters coming in that Wal-Mart still keeps its price leadership," Boer said. "I think that's one of the promises they continue to want to make. This will have a continuing effect on our markets." Wal-Mart on Thursday reported third quarter earnings with worse than expected sales, also due to falling food prices. Boer said Ahold Delhaize is familiar with both German chains due to their growth in the Netherlands. Ahold Delhaize owns the dominant Dutch chain Albert Heijn, which has thrived despite a German onslaught. "As a European retailer in the U.S...we are sharing a lot of our information about the work Lidl and Aldi are doing (in the Dutch market) to help our American colleagues to be well prepared." Boer also said he expects commodity price deflation, which has impacted meat and dairy prices, to ease next year. He said it was too early to say whether the election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president would lead to higher inflation, as some investors are speculating. Ahold Delhaize shares were down 3.5 percent at 19.92 euros at 1600 GMT in Amsterdam.

During the post-earnings call with investors, CEO Doug McMillion mentioned the world’s largest retailer’s commitment to being the best and beating all comers. “Overall, we’re in it to win it,” McMillion noted toward the end of his remarks as he finished off listing Walmart’s myriad accomplishments in Q3. And, as has been Walmart’s pattern in 2016, there is a fair amount to crow about. For the third quarter in a row Walmart has beaten analysts’ predictions on revenue and marked same-store sales increases (a difficult magic trick in retail these days) — and in Q3 the company also had some more than solid growth in eCommerce lines and on the global scene. But investors were less than thrilled by all those green arrows — as they were accompanied by an uncomfortably red arrow in the profitability tally — and share prices have taken a hit, down around 2.9  percent in pre-market trading. So what’s the need to know in all that information? By The Numbers  Walmart managed to beat on earnings again in Q3, noting $0.98 a share, $0.02 more than the Wall Street consensus, according to Bloomberg. Sales, however, were a bit of a miss, though they increased. Walmart brought in sales of $118.18 billion, an 0.7 percent increase over the prior year period, but below the Thomson Reuters forecast of $118.7 billion. Comparable-store sales were up by 1.2 percent — which again was a slight miss of the 1.3 forecast for the quarter. Traffic was on the increase, up 0.7 percent, a fact McMillion credited Walmart’s staff with. The biggest numerical miss was in profit, which was down 8.2 percent. That big bite comes as Walmart is investing big in infrastructure, store modernization and eCommerce enhancements. Those improvements — although necessary to achieve Walmart’s vision of being the and most reliable retailer in the world, according to McMillion — have also cost the retailer billions of dollars. Most notably and recently that included the $3 billion acquisition of Jet.com. But that investment is already showing signs of bearing fruit — as Walmart’s eCommerce results in Q3 were striking — and greatly picked up on the pace of anemic eCommerce growth in the year’s prior two quarters. Digital sales popped up 20.6 percent (excluding currency swings). That figure, comprising an assist from Jet.com, was included in the quarter for six weeks. All in all, eCommerce sales added 0.5 percent to the U.S. same-store sales figure, “our largest contribution yet,” McMillon noted. “We’re executing well in our stores and making strategic investments in eCommerce to accelerate growth,” he added. In It To Win It  Though Walmart’s less-than-expected haul cause investors some heartburn, the figures hit about 24 hours after rival Target announced same-store sales with falling traffic (although with sincere hopes that the situation would be flipped during the upcoming holiday). Charlie O’Shea, lead retail analyst at Moody’s, thinks that Walmart could also have a killer Christmas if the company can leverage its store network to handle online orders, especially via its buy-online/pick-up-in-store capability, as well as increasing benefits from Jet.com. McMillon also noted that Walmart isn’t just growing eCommerce, it is building it out right, with a partner in Jet.com that fully understands and supports Walmart’s commitment to “basket economics.” “When customers build a bigger basket online, everybody actually wins — and the system functions better for everyone,” he said. Walmart very much wants to win. And against its physical world peers, it is well positioned — as earnings have tumbled out this week, brick-and-mortar players (particularly department and box stores) have been rolling out results that are not exactly stellar. If that is the race, Walmart is well ahead of the game. But Walmart’s real race is with the future — and a shopping base that is moving ever more online. The competition is there with Amazon, the retail upstart that stole Walmart’s market cap crown a year or two ago. Walmart wants that crown back — and is willing to sacrifice an awful lot of money and effort to get there. It should be a holiday season well worth watching.

Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen testified before Congress that signs of an improving U.S. economy has strengthened the case for a rate increase sooner rather than later. She also noted that the risk of spurring a recession climbs if the central bank continues to wait to make a move and then is forced to raise rates too quickly later. "This is a much stronger hint than ever given before," said Peggy Bowie, a senior equity trader at Manulife Asset Management. "Her guidance after that basically is, if they don't make a move, I think she hinted that they could end up behind the curve. The near-term risk could be unbalanced and they would have to move faster." Investors have anticipated for months that the Fed would raise rates at its next two-day meeting starting Dec. 13, after the dust settles on the U.S. election results earlier this month. It's expected that it will be a small increase of a quarter of a percentage point, from the current range of 0.25 per cent to 0.5 per cent. The central bank last made a move on rates a year ago in December. It had forecasted multiple rate hikes in 2016, but economic data showed weak growth, forcing it to pause its plans. On Wall Street, stock markets reacted favourably, with bank stocks seeing a sharp rise. Higher interest rates bode well for financial institutions who will earn more profits on loans. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 35.68 points at 18,903.82, while the S&P 500 advanced 10.18 points at 2,187.12. Almost all of the S&P 500's gains since the presidential election have gone to financial stocks. They lagged the market for much of this year, but they're now trading at their highest levels since May 2008, months before the financial crisis peaked. Investors hope banks will benefit from higher interest rates, faster economic growth and lighter regulation under U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. The Nasdaq composite jumped 39.39 points at 5,333.97. In Toronto, the S&P/TSX composite gained 92.87 points at 14,826.09, pushed higher as consumer discretionary and industrials stocks advanced. Bowie said the industrials sector is still enjoying the optimism from Trump's victory. One of Trump's biggest promises has been that he will put money towards new, massive infrastructure projects. In currencies, the Canadian dollar dipped 0.36 of a U.S. cent at 74.04 cents US, as oil tracked lower and the U.S. dollar strengthened. In commodities, the December crude oil contract declined 15 cents at US$45.42 per barrel, while the January contract, which traded at a higher volume, fell 12 cents at $45.98 per barrel. The December gold contract lost $7 at US$1,216.90 per ounce and the December copper contract gained two cents at US$2.49 per pound. The December contract for natural gas fell six cents at US$2.70 per mmBTU.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.8 percent to 18,011.79 as the yen hit a six-month low, helping shares of the country’s big exporters. South Korea’s Kospi shed 0.4 percent to 1,972.64 while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.3 percent to 22,318.47. The Shanghai Composite slipped 0.1 percent to 3,206.64 while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 crept up 0.2 percent to 5,347.30. Benchmarks in Taiwan and Indonesia fell while Singapore’s rose. RATE HORIZON: In remarks to Congress, Yellen suggested the U.S. central bank is on track to raise interest rates when policymakers hold their final meeting of the year in December. She said the improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising rates, in comments that increased certainty for investors. The Fed raised its key interest rate in December 2015 but it’s still at ultralow levels that have fueled a multiyear global stock market boom. Economists forecast rates will go up by a quarter-point in December followed by two more hikes in 2017. MARKET INSIGHT: “The greatest uncertainties, namely the election and the Fed rate hike, were significantly reduced over the last two weeks, which gave the market a good reason to refocus on the fundamentals of economic and corporate earnings,” said Margaret Yang, an analyst at CMC Markets. CURRENCIES: The greenback rallied on the prospect of U.S. higher interest rates. The dollar climbed to 110.60 yen — its highest since the end of May — from 110.17 yen in late trading Thursday. The euro fell to its lowest in nearly a year, sinking to $1.0597 from $1.0614. WALL STREET: The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.2 percent to 18,903.82. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 0.5 percent to 2,187.12. The Nasdaq composite added 0.7 percent to 5,333.97. ENERGY: Oil extended its decline. Benchmark U.S. crude futures slid 54 cents to $44.88 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 15 cents to settle at $45.42 a barrel on Thursday. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slipped 43 cents to $46.69 a barrel in London.

Life Buy/Sell U.S. Business AP Arkansas high court bars union from protesting at Wal-Mart By ANDREW DeMILLO Associated Press Nov 17, 2016 (…) LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — A labor union was kept barred from protesting or demonstrating at Wal-Mart's stores and offices in Arkansas after the state's highest court on Thursday scaled back a judge's order prohibiting the group from entering the retail giant's property for anything other than shopping. The Arkansas Supreme Court upheld a Benton County judge's trespassing order against the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, but modified the injunction to cover only activities such as picketing, demonstrations and flash mobs against the Bentonville-based company. "We agree with the union that the circuit court's injunction and declaration encompassing all non-shopping activity or conduct is simply too broad," the court said in its ruling. The union and its affiliate group, the Organization United for Respect at Wal-Mart, had argued that the National Labor Relations Board, not the Benton County judge, should have jurisdiction over the matter. Justices disagreed and noted that appellate courts in several other states have rejected that argument. "We are pleased at the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision to narrow the overbroad order," Randy Parraz, campaign director for the union's Making Change at Wal-Mart campaign, said in a statement. "Make no mistake, Making Change at Walmart will continue to fight for a better life for the millions of hard-working Walmart employees in every state across this country whose economic struggles have been long forgotten or ignored by Walmart and so many others." Wal-Mart sued the union over the demonstrations, which it said has included flash mobs where demonstrators have banged on pots and pans and marched and chanted through its stores. Other activities have included rallies and picketing at its stores and offices, the company said. The retail giant has filed similar suits against the union in Florida and Texas in recent years. "We appreciate the court protecting property rights and upholding our right to seek enforcement of the trespass laws against unions in these situations," Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg said in an email. "As the court's opinion notes, other states have agreed with this approach." The union had argued that the company's trespassing complaint in Arkansas was nearly identical to one it had also filed with the national board. An attorney for Wal-Mart told the court last month that trespassing was a state issue and was properly before the state judge.

"Further, picketing, patrolling, parading, demonstrations, hand-billing and solicitation are all protected activities under the right circumstances," she wrote. "It behooves this court to return this case to the circuit court where an order that clearly does not run afoul of the National Labor Relations Act can be crafted with the assistance of the litigants." ___ Follow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ademillo Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today 3 Big Gifts Walmart Just Delivered to Investors Before Black Friday Wall Street may have been lukewarm on Walmart's third-quarter results, but the retailer had several important wins. Brian Sozzi Nov 17, 2016 10:35 AM EST While Wall Street handed Walmart (WMT) a lump of coal on Thursday in response to third-quarter earnings, the world's largest retailer managed to score several big wins in front of the crucial holiday shopping season.  Walmart's stock fell about 3% in early trading Thursday as total sales rose 0.7% from the prior year to $118.2 billion, missing Wall Street forecasts for $118.8 billion. Sales were clipped by $2.1 billion due to the relative strength of the U.S. dollar since the summer months. Food price deflation didn't help the company, either.  Earnings came in at 98 cents a share, beating projections for 96 cents a share. Walmart lifted its full-year earnings outlook to $4.20 to $4.35 a share from previous guidance of $4.15 to $4.35 a share. Here are several key things Wall Street may have overlooked in Walmart's earnings report that suggest the holiday season may turn out pretty festive for the Bentonville, AR. based discounter.   Walmart has more momentum headed into holidays than its archnemesis.  Amid investments in lower merchandise prices and higher wages for store workers, Walmart's U.S. sales are on the comeback trail. Walmart U.S. notched a same-store sales increase of 1.2%, the division's ninth straight gain. Meanwhile, Target's (TGT) third-quarter same-store sales fell for the second consecutive quarter, dropping 0.2%.  The momentum this year for Walmart is a sign its initiatives to draw in spendthrift U.S. shoppers are working, and may pay big dividends during the holiday season.  Prev 0 of 2 Next If you liked this article you might like Jim Cramer's Mad Money: Keep One Eye on Earnings, the Other on Politics Next Week Holiday-shortened week holds a feast of earnings reports, says Jim Cramer.

(AP) — A labor union was kept barred from protesting or demonstrating at Wal-Mart's stores and offices in Arkansas after the state's highest court on Thursday scaled back a judge's order prohibiting the group from entering the retail giant's property for anything other than shopping. The Arkansas Supreme Court upheld a Benton County judge's trespassing order against the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, but modified the injunction to cover only activities such as picketing, demonstrations and flash mobs against the Bentonville-based company. "We agree with the union that the circuit court's injunction and declaration encompassing all non-shopping activity or conduct is simply too broad," the court said in its ruling. The union and its affiliate group, the Organization United for Respect at Wal-Mart, had argued that the National Labor Relations Board, not the Benton County judge, should have jurisdiction over the matter. Justices disagreed and noted that appellate courts in several other states have rejected that argument. "We are pleased at the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision to narrow the overbroad order," Randy Parraz, campaign director for the union's Making Change at Wal-Mart campaign, said in a statement. "Make no mistake, Making Change at Walmart will continue to fight for a better life for the millions of hard-working Walmart employees in every state across this country whose economic struggles have been long forgotten or ignored by Walmart and so many others." Wal-Mart sued the union over the demonstrations, which it said has included flash mobs where demonstrators have banged on pots and pans and marched and chanted through its stores.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.8 percent to 18,011.79 as the yen hit a six-month low, helping shares of the country's big exporters. South Korea's Kospi shed 0.4 percent to 1,972.64 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.3 percent to 22,318.47. The Shanghai Composite slipped 0.1 percent to 3,206.64 while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 crept up 0.2 percent to 5,347.30. Benchmarks in Taiwan and Indonesia fell while Singapore's rose. RATE HORIZON: In remarks to Congress, Yellen suggested the U.S. central bank is on track to raise interest rates when policymakers hold their final meeting of the year in December. She said the improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising rates, in comments that increased certainty for investors. The Fed raised its key interest rate in December 2015 but it's still at ultralow levels that have fueled a multiyear global stock market boom. Economists forecast rates will go up by a quarter-point in December followed by two more hikes in 2017. MARKET INSIGHT: "The greatest uncertainties, namely the election and the Fed rate hike, were significantly reduced over the last two weeks, which gave the market a good reason to refocus on the fundamentals of economic and corporate earnings," said Margaret Yang, an analyst at CMC Markets. CURRENCIES: The greenback rallied on the prospect of U.S. higher interest rates. The dollar climbed to 110.60 yen — its highest since the end of May — from 110.17 yen in late trading Thursday. The euro fell to its lowest in nearly a year, sinking to $1.0597 from $1.0614. WALL STREET: The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.2 percent to 18,903.82. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.5 percent to 2,187.12. The Nasdaq composite added 0.7 percent to 5,333.97. ENERGY: Oil extended its decline. Benchmark U.S. crude futures slid 54 cents to $44.88 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 15 cents to settle at $45.42 a barrel on Thursday.

By Roger Baird November 17, 2016 14:34 GMT Supermarket Asda posted another sharp fall in its third quarter salesMatt Cardy/Getty Images Supermarket Asda has posted another sharp fall in sales, highlighting the uphill task the new boss faces as he attempts to turn the business around. The chain – owned by US retail giant Walmart – reported a 5.8% plunge in like-for-likes sales, excluding petrol, in its third quarter to 30 September. This comes on the back of a poor previous three months, when the group reported a 7.5% slump in sales, its worst quarterly performance on record. Major supermarkets such as Asda have been locked in a five-year price war with discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, as cash-strapped shoppers hunt for lower prices. New chief executive Sean Clarke, who took up the reins in July replacing previous boss Andy Clarke, has slashed the prices of everyday items as he bids to arrest falling sales at the group. Clarke, the former boss of Walmart's China business, said: "We have lowered thousands of prices, improved hundreds of own brand products and invested in more hours for colleagues on the shop floor – so it's encouraging to see more customers shopping with us in stores and online." Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said about the group's UK arm: "The key priority remains driving an improved customer experience and building sales momentum by simplifying the offer, improving product availability and making strategic investments in service and price." High street retailers have been hit by the slump in the value of the pound since June's Brexit vote, which is putting pressure on suppliers to raise prices to cover mounting costs. Respected Kantar Worldpanel data said Asda's sales dropped 5.2% in the latest quarter – the slowest decline for four months. But its market share slipped by one percentage point to 15.6%. However, Asda is being outpaced by major rivals, with Tesco increasing its market share for the first time in five years after Kantar said its sales rose by 1.3%. Morrisons also recently saw like-for-like sales lift 1.6% in the third quarter, boosted by strong trading at Halloween.

Denise Collier-Bailey said she just noticed two men sitting in the vestibule of the Short Pump superstore. It wasn't until she actually walked inside the store that her daughter asked, "Did you see that deer in the shopping cart?" Collier-Bailey had not, so she and her teenage daughter walked back out to get a closer look. The daughter took a photo. Dead deer in Walmart shopping cart (PHOTO: Denise Collier-Bailey) The gutted deer was in the shopping cart, dripping blood on the floor, she said. "The things you see at Wal-Mart," she said in a phone interview with WTVR on Wednesday. "This just topped it all." Collier-Bailey said she did not bother the men and just went back into Wal-Mart after taking the photos. "We were just... I couldn't believe it," Collier-Bailey said. Dead deer in Walmart shopping cart (PHOTO: Denise Collier-Bailey) Walmart spokesman Charles Crowson confirmed the incident. He said a customer alerted store management and a manager quickly told the men to take their deer and go. Crowson did not know why the men rolled the dead deer into Walmart, but made it clear the carcass never made it into the shopping areas of the store. Commenters on the WTVR's Facebook page reported they had seen a deer running around the area earlier that evening. One even reported the deer had been hit and killed by a vehicle near Wal-Mart. Lee Walker, with the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, speculated the men might be hunters simply trying to follow Virginia law. "It appears that they were trying to follow the law by checking in the harvested deer, but were not at an approved check station," Walker said. "In most cases hunters do not bring harvested game actually into an approved checked station, but rather have someone from the store come out to verify the harvest and to record the needed information." Main deer hunting season in much of the state runs through Jan. 2. 37.666109 -77.627838 Filed in: Nation/World Topics: Virginia, Wal-Mart Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email KTLA 5 News on Facebook Popular New Federal Overtime Law Takes Effect Dec. 1, Will Impact Millions of U.S. Workers Arizona Grandmother’s Accidental Invite to Wrong Teen for Thanksgiving Dinner Goes Viral Texas Teacher Impregnated by 13-Year-Old Student She Had Sex With ‘on Almost Daily Basis’ Pleads Guilty: Report Professor Who Correctly Predicted 2016 Election Outcome Forecasts Trump Impeachment Latest News Liberte and Justice for Paws, November 20, 2016 NASA Launches New Satellite to Improve Aging Weather Satellite System With More Precise Data, Near Real-Time Imagery Priebus Defends Trump’s $25M Settlement Saying President-Elect Wants to Lead Country ‘Without Distraction’ Anaheim Police Fatally Shoot Suspect Wanted for Allegedly Ramming SUV into Another Car on 91 Freeway; No Officers Injured Nation/World Texas Police Launch Investigation After Facebook Photos Show Man Apparently Dragging Girl By Hair Through Wal-Mart Nation/World 1 Dead, 2 Injured as Good Samaritans Save Mom, Baby From Attackers Outside Wal-Mart in Kansas Nation/World Mother Gives Birth in Checkout Line at Utah Wal-Mart, Insists on Paying for Merchandise Nation/World Stranger Grabbed, Choked 4-Month-Old in Wal-Mart Checkout Line, Kansas Mother Says Local News Mom Arrested After Allegedly Leaving Baby in Car While Shopping at Wal-Mart in Palm Springs Nation/World Texas Teacher Brought to Tears When Good Samaritan Pays for Her School Supplies at Wal-Mart Nation/World US Government Grants Wal-Mart Patent to Roll Out ‘Self-Driving’ Shopping Carts Nation/World Wal-Mart to Cut 7,000 Jobs, Offer Workers New Role in Company Nation/World Dashcam Video Captures Driver Apparently Being Attacked by Deer She Hit on New Jersey Road Money Smart Nation/World Nearly 1 Million Wal-Mart Workers Awarded Cash Bonuses as Part of Incentive Plan Nation/World Florida Wal-Mart Removes 9/11-Themed Coke Display After Photo Sparks Backlash Nation/World Woman Dies After Being Run Over by Her Own Vehicle in Parking Lot of Memphis Wal-Mart Local News Family of North Hollywood Ice Cream Vendor Starts Fundraising Page to Help Him Retire After Violent Robbery Mobile Apps Android App iPhone & iPad App KTLA 5 News on Social Media Watch CW Shows Facebook Twitter Instagram Email Alerts About & Contact screenertv Screener Online Public File • Terms of Service • Privacy Policy • 5800 Sunset Blvd. Los Angeles, CA, 90028 • Copyright © 2016, KTLA • A Tribune Broadcasting Station • Powered by WordPress.com VIP × Email Alerts Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

Quebec CAQ hit with legal warning, claims it's being 'muzzled' Business Driving: Excellent family sedans that are gentle on the wallet 5 / 5 Business a.m.: Wal-Mart profits take a hit, Canadian mortgage rates edge up Paul Delean, Montreal Gazette More from Paul Delean, Montreal Gazette Published on: November 17, 2016 | Last Updated: November 17, 2016 9:57 AM EST Wal-Mart profits slipped 8.2 per cent in Q3 Damian Dovarganes / AP Share Adjust Comment Print Here’s our look at the big stories this morning on the business beat: Retail giant stumbles: Third-quarter profit fell 8.2 per cent at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. as the retail chain struggles to fend off competition from online leader Amazon.com and other rivals. The company earned $3 billion (U.S.) for the three months ended Oct. 31, down from $3.3 billion a year earlier. Revenue was up 0.7 per cent, to $118 billion. Revenue at stores opened at least a year rose 1.2 per cent. E-commerce sales now represent 20.6 per cent, up from 11.8 per cent in the previous quarter. Wal-Mart has launched a number of changes online and in the store, from cleaning up its stores to being sharper on prices. It’s melding online services with the stores, and pressing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. The company told investors in October that it was planning to slow its new store openings and pour money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels. In September, it completed its deal to buy fast-growing Jet.com for $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock in an acquisition aimed at helping the retailer attract younger and more affluent customers to drive online sales. Mortgage rate movement: Like Royal Bank of Canada, TD Bank has increased its fixed mortgage rates, the latest sign that Canada’s big banks are hiking the costs of borrowing for homeowners. Cheryl Ficker, a spokeswoman for TD, said the lender raised its special rate offer for a four-year fixed mortgage by five basis points to 2.44 per cent and for a five-year fixed mortgage by 10 basis points to 2.69 per cent.  Rob McLister, a mortgage broker at IntelliMortgage, said he expects the other big banks will quickly move in lockstep because of a massive sell-off in the bond market that has made it more expensive for banks to get access to cash. “When bond yields shoot up 25-plus basis points like we’ve seen in the last week, the big banks move like a herd,” said McLister. McLister said he expects the other big banks to boost their five-year fixed mortgage rates by 10 to 40 basis points. RBC’s special offers for a four-year fixed rate mortgage are rising by 30 basis points today to 2.79 per cent. A five-year fixed mortgage rate will be 2.94 per cent, an increase of 30 basis points. New avenues for shopping: Developers of a shopping centre at the junction of Highways 40, 30 and 20 in Vaudreuil-Dorion provided more details this week on their ambitious plan, to be completed in phases over the next few years. Called Les Avenues Vaudreuil, it will comprise 1.4 million square feet of retail space and consist of distinct shopping “avenues” specialized in areas such as fashion, food, sports and leisure. In all, it’s projected there will be 225 stores, restaurants and services. The developer, Harden, foresees it becoming ” a social and shopping hub for western Quebec, Eastern Ontario and beyond.”  It said the project represents an investment of $475 million in the local economy. Premier prix: Montrealers Isabelle and Marie-Hélène Primeau of Premier Continuum Inc. were among the winners this week at the 24th annual RBC Canadian Women Entrepreneur Awards. They received the ADP Micro Business Award for operators of small businesses generating revenue of less than $1 million. Founded in 1997, Premier Continuum is a consulting firm specialized in business continuity, emergency and risk management. Rally ends: European stocks fell today while Asian markets ended mixed, after a seven-day Wall Street rally faded on Wednesday. The Toronto Stock Exchange also was down Wednesday, by 0.16 per cent, but prospects for today are better because of a snapback in crude oil prices, back trading over $46 (U.S.) a barrel. The Canadian dollar has strengthened slightly to 74.4 cents (U.S.). pdelean@postmedia.com Business a.m.: Double-digit profit surge at Metro, Loblaw also makes a...

Revenue was below forecasts, and U.S. comparable-store sales were up 1.2 percent compared to estimates of up 1.3 percent. Wal-Mart did raise the lower end of its full-year earnings forecast range. Best Buy — The electronics retailer reported a blowout quarter, beating earnings estimates by 15 cents a share at an adjusted 62 cents per share. Revenue and same-store sales were both above estimates, as well. JM Smucker — The food producer earned an adjusted $2.05 per share for its latest quarter, beating estimates of $1.93 a share. Revenue came in below Street forecasts. The company's results were impacted by slower sales of pet foods like Meow Mix, as well as Folgers coffee and JIF peanut butter. Staples — The office products retailer matched estimates, with adjusted quarterly profit of 34 cents per share. Revenue was below forecasts. Staples saw a bigger-than-expected four percent drop in same-store sales during the quarter, as it continues to work through its turnaround plan. Amazon.com, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Netflix — Piper Jaffray issued a report saying the "fear trade" that's battered these mega-cap tech stocks presents a rare buying opportunity. Piper feels the fear came from Donald Trump sound bites that are unlikely to manifest themselves in actual policy. Microsoft — Microsoft was upgraded to "buy" from "neutral" at Goldman Sachs, with the price target raised to $68 per share from $60 a share. The firm said its upgrade is based on improving revenue and profit margins in Microsoft's ongoing shift to cloud-based business. Chipotle Mexican Grill — Guggenheim downgraded the restaurant chain to "sell" from "neutral," citing increased valuation risk with optimism about a recovery already baked into the stock's price. It said Chipotle faces increasing competition and margin pressures going forward. First Solar — JMP upgraded the solar company to "market perform" from "market underperform," saying the company's financial issues are now reflected in the stock's price and that it is taking appropriate steps to fix its finances. Cisco Systems — The networking equipment maker reported adjusted quarterly profit of 61 cents per share, two cents a share above estimates. Revenue was also slightly above forecasts, but the company gave current-quarter guidance below Street forecasts amid increasing competition and slowing demand from the telecom industry. L Brands — L Brands came in two cents a share ahead of estimates, with quarterly profit of 42 cents per share. Revenue was also slightly above estimates. The Victoria's Secret parent gave current-quarter earnings guidance that came in below consensus forecasts, however, citing an increasingly competitive environment and overall slowing store traffic for retailers. NetApp — NetApp reported adjusted quarterly profit of 60 cents per share, six cents a share above estimates. Revenue was slightly short of forecasts for the provider of data storage services. NetApp cheered investors by providing better-than-expected guidance for the current quarter, amid cuts in expenses. Amgen — Amgen announced upbeat results for its experimental migraine drug in a phase 3 study. The biotech firm said the drug significantly reduced monthly migraines and that the study results were statistically significant. JPMorgan Chase — The bank will reported pay more than $250 million to settle a U.S. probe into its China hiring practices, according to Reuters. Hain Celestial — Hain's shares are getting a boost after an independent review showed no wrongdoing in the organic food company's accounting practices. Toyota — The automaker will set up a new electric vehicle unit, aiming to get an all-electric product to market as quickly as possible.

Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA Sarah Butler @whatbutlersaw Thursday 17 November 2016 12.52 EST Last modified on Thursday 17 November 2016 17.00 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Asda has reported a near 6% fall in sales at established stores, confirming its position as the worst performing major UK supermarket. Sales at the Walmart-owned chain’s established stores dropped by 5.8% in the three months to 30 September. That was an improvement on the previous quarter, when sales were down by 7.5%, but puts Asda well behind rivals Tesco and Morrisons, which recently reported underlying sales growth. Last week, Sainsbury’s announced a 1% fall in underlying sales in the 28 weeks to 24 September. Walmart said the UK was the only one of its 11 international markets not experiencing growth at stores open for more than a year, as the number of shoppers fell by 4.2% year on year. Operating income also dipped in the UK, with shoppers spending 1.6% less on average on each visit. Walmart’s chief financial officer, Brett Biggs, said: “The key priority remains driving an improved customer experience and building sales momentum by simplifying the offer, improving product availability and making strategic investments in service and price.” Asda is trying to fight off heavy competition from the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl, which have stolen its once strong position as the UK’s cheapest grocer. Asda only operates large outlets and has been unable to tap into the rise of convenience stores, unlike Tesco and Sainsbury’s. It has also suffered from a number of recent upsets, including a card reader glitch that led to angry queues of customers in stores last month and a BBC Watchdog investigation that criticised Asda for dirty home delivery crates. Patrick O’Brien, an analyst at consultancy Verdict Retail, said: “Asda’s positioning has plunged it into crisis. The discounters have undermined its low price stance, but it is unable to position its brand or customer experience as offering more than the discounters, in the way that its big four rivals have been able to do. The others never traded on being the cheapest, but Asda did, and now it isn’t.” He said that unless Walmart chose to use its financial muscle “to take the price war to a new level”, Asda had to find a new way to attract shoppers. Sean Clarke, who stepped in to replace Andy Clarke as chief executive of Asda in July, said shopper numbers had started rising again over the previous quarter. “We have lowered thousands of prices, improved hundreds of own brand products and invested in more hours for colleagues on the shop floor, so it’s encouraging to see more customers shopping with us in stores and online,” he said. Consumer body Which? had found Asda to have the lowest prices on branded groceries for the seventh month in a row, recognising continuing price cuts at the supermarket, Clarke said.

By Liam Martin PUBLISHED: 08:40, Fri, Nov 18, 2016 | UPDATED: 15:35, Fri, Nov 18, 2016 Nintendo Classic Mini may be sold out in the UK, but the mini NES is available to buy in limited quantities in North America. With stock in such limited supply that some retailers weren't able to fulfil pre-orders, the news that US chain Walmart has new stock is a positive development for retro gaming fans hoping to buy one in time for Christmas. "Want the hottest gift of the holiday season?" reads a Walmart post. "Well, come and get it at Walmart.com. It’s available for sale at 2pm PST daily from Nov. 14 – Nov. 18. Limited quantities." The Nintendo Classic Mini page currently has placeholder prices attached, but the console will go on sale for the recommended retail price when stock is released. UK customers are currently faced with two choices. They can either wait for more stock to be released, or pay well over the odds for Nintendo Classic Mini consoles on sites like Amazon, eBay and in CEX.

"The Nintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition system is a hot item, and we are working hard to keep up with consumer demand," reads a Nintendo tweet. "There will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year. Smyths dropped a big hint about when the Nintendo Classic NES might be back in stock, telling fans to expect more units before December 9. "Based on our initial allocation, all pre-orders are not guaranteed the Nintendo Classic Mini on release day," reads a Smyths statement. "We expect all pre-orders will be fulfilled by December 9. You will be notified via email of the expected delivery date closer to the time." Express Online has contacted Nintendo for an update on Nintendo Classic Mini stock. In terms of games, the Nintendo Classic Mini features Final Fantasy, the original Super Mario Bros Trilogy, The Legend of Zelda, Castlevania and Mega Man 2.

Asda said underlying sales, excluding fuel, fell 5.8 percent in the three months to end September, an improvement on the record 7.5 percent drop recorded in the previous period but still the ninth straight quarter of decline. Asda, Britain's third biggest supermarket behind Tesco , Sainsbury's and ahead of Morrisons, has been hit by the advance of German discounters Aldi and Lidl. While the other three traditional groups have upped their game in recent years and started to fight back, Asda is still struggling to adapt and win back customers in the fiercely competitive sector. Asda's UK market share has slipped a full 1 percentage point over the last year to 15.5 percent. The task of steadying the ship falls to Sean Clarke, the former boss of Wal-Mart's China business who took over the top job in July. "We have lowered thousands of prices, improved hundreds of own brand products and invested in more hours for colleagues on the shop floor - so it's encouraging to see more customers shopping with us in stores and online," Clarke said.

Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.2 percent in the third quarter, the company said in a statement Thursday. That was just shy of the 1.3 percent predicted by analysts and marked a slowdown from the previous quarter. Total revenue also missed estimates, hurt in part by currency headwinds. The sluggish sales raised concerns for investors, despite Wal-Mart coming through on its pledge to energize its e-commerce business. Wal-Mart’s $3 billion purchase of Jet.com in September helped fuel a 21 percent gain in online sales last quarter, an acceleration from the 12 percent gain in the second quarter. But at its physical stores, a historic streak of food deflation put pressure on the chain. “We are not satisfied,” Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said in the statement. “We will continue to change and pick up speed to reach our longer-term aspirations.” Wal-Mart shares fell as much as 4.3 percent to $68.32 in New York, the biggest intraday drop since May. The stock had climbed 16 percent this year through Wednesday’s close, lifted by improving performance. That outpaced the 6.5 percent gain of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Revenue increased 0.7 percent to $118.2 billion in the third quarter, which ended Oct. 31. Overseas, the strong dollar weighed on sales, turning a 2.4 percent increase at its international unit into a 4.8 percent decline. But profit exceeded projections. Earnings amounted to 98 cents a share, topping the 96 cent estimate, helped by a better tax rate than analysts were anticipating. Wal-Mart also raised the lower end of its forecast for the year. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company now expects annual earnings of $4.20 to $4.35 a share, excluding some items. It had previously set the bottom of the range at $4.15. Trump Impact? Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said it is too early to tell how the incoming Donald Trump administration will affect its business. The president-elect’s pledge to renegotiate trade deals with Mexico and China could have a major impact on Wal-Mart, which imports many of its products from China and has a large business in Mexico. “It is way too early to speculate on anything that might happen with the president-elect,” Biggs said. “When policies change or shift, we will be ready to respond to those and make sure we do what is right for the company.” Grocery prices across the country have dropped on a year-over-year basis for 10 straight months, a streak of deflation not seen since 1960. That’s been good for consumers, but it’s brought headaches to Wal-Mart, the largest seller of groceries in the U.S. Eggs and beef have have grown especially cheap, making competition fiercer between supermarkets. The run of deflation has squeezed profit margins and sent shares of some low-cost chains tumbling. Since taking the helm in 2014, McMillon has boosted pay for U.S. workers, tried to improve Wal-Mart’s grocery quality and spent billions on its online operations -- aiming to gain ground on Amazon.com Inc. He also is pushing to lower Wal-Mart’s prices, clean up stores and take better care of customers. E-commerce sales growth had been slowing, and Wal-Mart has been trying to shore up the business. The Jet.com deal gave Wal-Mart access to the startup’s technology and management, as well as contributing more than a month worth of its sales to the retailer’s third quarter. “E-commerce was a highlight,” Biggs said in an interview. “We expect to continue seeing that momentum.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

LOCAL STORIES | GREEN | HEALTH | OPINIONS      CALENDAR | ARTS&CULTURE | MUSIC | DINING | FILM | GUIDES | N&R EVENTS      CLASSIFIEDS Tweet Walmart wins Big box set to expand with nod from City Council By Howard Hardee This article was published on 11.17.16. Advertisement As a member of the public told the Chico City Council during its meeting on Tuesday (Nov. 15), Walmart’s proposed expansion needn’t be a divisive, left vs. right issue. And yet, when it came to a decision, the panel split down party lines, voting 4-3 to approve the big-box’s bid to get even bigger. The proposal for the retail giant’s location on Forest Avenue includes an interior expansion of about 64,500 square feet, including more space for groceries and a deli; 134 additional parking spaces; a pick-up area for customers who order groceries or prescription drugs online; an eight-pump gas station and convenience store; street access improvements; and two parcels for future development. On Oct. 5, the Chico Planning Commission voted 5-2 to greenlight the project. A couple of weeks later, a group opposing Walmart’s expansion filed an appeal. Brett Jolley, an attorney out of Stockton, delivered it on behalf of Chico Advocates for a Responsible Economy (CARE), which mounted a successful campaign against Walmart’s plans for a supercenter a decade ago. On Tuesday, the City Council held a public hearing as its members decided whether to uphold or deny the appeal. Jolley presented his client’s case against Walmart. He argued that the council couldn’t certify the findings in the environmental impact report (EIR) because it understates the potential negative economic effects on nearby grocery stores such as FoodMaxx and WinCo. Also, the corporation recently has revealed plans to close 200 stores nationwide as sales shift online, diminishing the need for brick-and-mortar locations. “What happens when this store goes out of business? You don’t want to be stuck with a vacant big box,” Jolley said. Councilwoman Reanette Fillmer was skeptical. “Just out of curiosity, how many lawsuits against Walmart have you filed, besides this one?” she asked Jolley. “In my my career, over the last 15 years, I’d estimate probably 10 to 15,” he said. “And then, you’re from Stockton, not from the city of Chico?” Fillmer followed up. “That’s correct,” Jolley answered. Mayor Mark Sorensen jumped in: “And who pays for your efforts?” The attorney seemed puzzled. “Well,” he said, “different clients pay for my efforts.” That exchange resurfaced throughout the hearing, including when the council opened the floor for public comment. “The attorney being from Stockton is not an issue, and I don’t know why that came up,” speaker Chris Nelson said. “Our city attorney isn’t local, either.” Nearly 30 people addressed the dais. Opponents cited the expansion’s potential to increase traffic congestion and air pollution in Chico’s southeast shopping district, the corporation’s poor treatment of employees and its well-documented strategy of putting competing local retailers out of business. On the other hand, the council heard from elderly and low-income residents who said Walmart is the only place they can afford to shop. As for employment practices, store manager Kim Turner said that 78 percent of Walmart’s employees in Chico are full-time and some enjoy generous salaries and benefits packages. “If they’re happy working at Walmart, that’s their business,” she said. Walmart’s corporate representatives had the last word. Philip Serghini, director of public affairs, said the Chico location opened in 1994 and badly needs an upgrade. The bigger store would hire 85 more employees and provide the city with an additional $314,000 in annual sales tax revenue, he said. “We want to give you the Walmart that you deserve.” It was Councilwoman Tami Ritter’s turn to be skeptical: “Mr. Serghini, where do you live?” “San Diego,” he replied. “And how many of these appeals do you do?” she pressed. “This is part of my full-time job,” Serghini said. Vice Mayor Sean Morgan made a motion to reject CARE’s appeal, which was seconded by Fillmer. Sorensen voted yes, but took a moment to reflect on Chico’s years-long Walmart saga. In 2009, he said, the council imposed “arbitrary and capricious demands that never would have been put on anyone else proposing the same project,” he said. “That debacle reverberated through the business community for years. … People really underestimate the damage that did to our ability to attract businesses.” Morgan’s motion passed, with Ritter and Councilmembers Ann Schwab and Randall Stone dissenting.

KMGH Copyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next DENVER -- The hottest toy of 2016 is nearly impossible to find, even though it's 30-years-old. The NES Classic Edition, an old school Nintendo with 30 preloaded games has been sold out since it went on sale on Friday. This week, however, Walmart has been putting an unknown number of consoles on sale every day at 3 p.m. Mountain Time. HOW-TO: Click here to go to the page that you'll need to repeatedly refresh at 3 p.m. Denver7 reporter (and former Nintendo owner) Marshall Zelinger, tried buying the Nintendo throwback at 3 p.m., ignoring his afternoon news meeting. After getting a "technical difficulties" error, an NES Classic was put in his checkout cart, and when he went to check out, the website said: "We're sorry, the item below is no longer available." After trying to check out a second time, another screen showed a new failure: "Due to state restrictions this item can't be shipped to 80203 or picked up in stores nearby." Walmart media relations did not respond to questions in an email form request sent shortly after the website fake out. Denver7 still wants to know how many consoles are being released each day and why the website appeared to find one in stock, just to say it was no longer available. When you try on Thursday and Friday, you may want to log into a Walmart online account ahead of time, for fast checkout. Also get acquainted with your "F5" key to refresh the page. eBay and other online shopping sites have NES Classic consoles already posted for four times as much, and one listed at $3,999.99. Why is the hottest toy something that many video gamers got tired of decades ago? "Just taking me back to my childhood, back to simpler times when we weren't hustling and bustling, worried about who the President was," said Justin Branch. "If you're looking at who grew up with it, we're all parents now, so who's going to buy it for their kids? The parents are buying it for their kids and the parents are going to want to play it with their kids." "I don't know if it's the simplicity or nostalgia," said Austin Clarkson. Denver7 found the two video gamers at Grandma's House, a brewery on South Broadway in Denver. Besides beer, the menu includes video games from yesteryear. "That's actually why we came here, was to play these games," said Clarkson. "They're pretty tough too. They're pretty challenging. You can't go back to a saved position. You have to sit down and play through the entire game, there's no going back, which I completely forgot about that." While chatting with Denver7, Branch was busy playing Street Fighter for Super Nintendo. He said he still had his original Nintendo at home. "Still rocking the Paperboy, Mario Bros, even some Tecmo Bowl," he said. "Man, if you ain't blowing in the cartridges man, you ain't doing it right." That's one benefit of the new system -- there is no need to blow into the cartridge itself to get the game to work. (Reporter's Note: You'll likely find online articles that suggest blowing into the cartridge did nothing, but Nintendo video gamers know that's not true.) Target, which is also sold out of the console, told Denver7: "We will be replenishing inventory throughout the holiday season and encourage guests to check back at their local Target store." Best Buy responded: "We don't comment on inventory, nor future release plans." --------- Sign up for Denver7 email alerts to stay informed about breaking news and daily headlines.

Shopping 5 0 0 November 16, 2016 Black Friday 2016 Deals And Ads: Walmart And Sears Pre-Black Friday Sales Are Live — Are They Any Good? Phillip Dengler Black Friday 2016, which will take place on November 25, is now only a little over a week away. While it remains one of the biggest days of the year for shopping, the sales actually start before the day itself. In addition to many Black Friday sales starting on Thanksgiving, others have already begun. Today, Walmart and Sears announced that pre-Black Friday sales would begin on their websites. While the top doorbusters are still over a week away, both retailers are claiming “huge savings” for their online shoppers. A more comprehensive listing of the sale items can be found at BestBlackFriday.com, but here are the top deals for both sales. Disclaimer: The author, Phillip Dengler, is the owner of BestBlackFriday.com, which is referenced in this article. The Inquisitr holds no ownership. Walmart’s Pre-Black Friday Sale Walmart started offering early bird specials on their website a few weeks ago, and they have upgraded this sale to their official pre-Black Friday event. Here are some of the more important items included in the sale. Samsung 50″ 5000 Series HD LED TV for $397 (save $602.99) Samsung 55″ 6500 Series – Curved 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV for $697 (save $802.99) Dyson Light Ball Multifloor Bagless Upright Vacuum for $249 (save $140) Xbox One S 500GB with Your Choice of Bonus Game, 4k UltraHD Movie, and Controller (save up to $80.83) Pie Face Game for $12.99 (save $6.83) Keurig K50 Coffee Maker for $79 (save $10) RCA Voyager 7″ 16GB Tablet Android 6.0 for $34.98 (save $25.01) Acer Aspire E5-575-72L3 15.6″ Laptop for $449 (save $250) BouncePro 14′ Trampoline with Proflex Enclosure and Electron Shooter Game for $199 (save $120) KitchenAid Classic 4.5-Qt Stand Mixer, K45SS for $189 (save $60) Sceptre X405BV-F 40″ LED Class 1080P HDTV for $199.99 (save $200) Weslo Cadence G 5.9i Treadmill for $287 (save $212) Additionally, you can save up to $50 by opening a Walmart credit card account. Many of the items in the sale may go in and out of stock, so check back often for updates. How Does The Sale Compare To Walmart’s Black Friday Sale? .@Walmart's best #BlackFriday deals https://t.co/eeIoE4QEgq pic.twitter.com/pbn1jUgkwC — CNET (@CNET) November 14, 2016 As expected, the actual Walmart sale is the more diverse event. With over 600 items, it is going to be among the larger sales, and the prices on premium electronics are very competitive. One of the featured deals in the current pre-Black Friday sale is a 500 GB Xbox One S Bundle with the choice of a bonus game, a movie, and an extra controller for $299 to $487.97. The final price will depend on your selections, but you can save up to $80.83. On Black Friday, Walmart will be offering the Xbox One S White 500GB Battlefield Bundle for $249, which is a discount of $50. While it will be cheaper to get an Xbox One S if you wait until Black Friday, the current bundle may be better for your individual needs. The pre-Black Friday event is also selling the Proscan PLDED4017 40″ 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV for $169.99, which is a discount of $80. On Black Friday, you will be able to purchase an Element or Hisense 40″ LED 1080p HDTV for $125. In this scenario, it is most likely better to wait until next week to purchase a television of this size. Both sets are comparable, but there is a premium to pay for getting it early. Walmart’s actual Black Friday sale is scheduled to begin on Thanksgiving at 6 p.m. Online doorbusters should be available the entire day on Thanksgiving, but there is a chance that select doorbusters go on sale on Wednesday night. In order to compare more of the items and prices in both sales, you can view the entire 34-page Walmart Black Friday 2016 ad at Savings.com. Sears’ Pre-Black Friday Sale For a limited time, Sears is holding their “Black Friday Now” sale on their website. It includes over 600 items, many of which are featured doorbusters, and it is only available online. Here are some of the more important items included in the sale. Craftsman 22″ 179cc Compact Dual-Stage Snowblower for $399.99 (save $300) NordicTrack Elite 10.9 Elliptical for $599.99 (save $1,000) Christmas Outdoor Decor for 30 Percent Off Craftsman 24V Max* Li-Ion 10″ Cordless Chainsaw for $79.99 (save $80) Samsung LED 19″ HDTV 720p 60Hz for $127.99 (save $12) Samsung 40″ Class Smart LED TV for $277.99 (save $172) Samsung 55″ Class 4K Smart UHD Curved TV for $697.99 (save $402) Samsung DV45H7000EW 7.4 cu. ft. Electric Dryer for $447.79 (save $252.20) Samsung WA45H7000AW 4.5 cu. ft. Top-Load Washer for $447.79 (save $252.20) Free shipping is available on all orders of $49 or more. Additionally, members can earn up to 100 percent back in points on certain items. How Does The Sale Compare To Sears’ Black Friday Sale? Before you even get the turkey you can start shopping BLACK FRIDAY pricing! Get special early savings right now! https://t.co/suWyqu2RIY pic.twitter.com/BWLyJAKLKx — Sears HometownStores (@SearsHTS) November 15, 2016 Similar to the pre-Black Friday sale at Walmart, the Sears version has the same general rules. Some of the items included are comparable to doorbuster pricing that will be available on Black Friday, but the best items are still a week away. One potentially better deal included in the Sears pre-Black Friday sale is a Samsung 40 Class LED Smart TV for $277.99. This TV normally retails for $449.99, so it is savings of $172. On Black Friday, Sears will sell a Samsung 40″ Smart 1080p LED HDTV for $249.99, and the savings is only $150. While you will have to pay more for the deal that is live now, the overall savings are better. In order to compare more of the items and prices in both sales, you can view the entire 48-page Sears Black Friday 2016 ad at Savings.com. As with the Walmart pre-Black Friday sale, items in the Sears pre-Black Friday sale may go in and out of stock.

Here's how the company hopes it will pay off. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Nov 16, 2016 at 7:48PM Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is no one's idea of an innovator. For most of its recent history, the retail giant was known for its rapacious expansion, paying rock-bottom wages, and offering the lowest prices around. But that's changing now. Competition from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and, to a lesser extent, Costco Wholesale has forced Wal-Mart to rethink its longtime strategy. Image source: Wal-Mart.  Since CEO Doug McMillon took the helm in February 2014, the company has been fast adapting to the new retail landscape in order to keep up with competitors and changing customer habits. Let's take a look at a few of the major changes McMillon and Co. have made over the last year. 1. Raising wages  Wal-Mart sent shockwaves throughout the retail industry in early 2015 when it announced it would hike wages above the national minimum wage of $7.25. It raised its base wage to $9/hour in April 2015 and followed it up with another hike to $10/hour in February 2016. Wal-Mart also said it would invest in training to streamline promotions and reduce turnover.  Those wage hikes will cost the company $2.7 billion annually, but the decision appears to be paying off. Before it made the initial announcement, Wal-Mart's customer satisfaction was at the bottom of the industry, and it had poor internal store performance scores based on things like cleanliness and out-of-stocks. Now, the company is expected to report its ninth straight quarter of comparable sales growth this week -- a streak that did not start until McMillon took control -- and its second-quarter comp of 1.6% was its best in several years. 2. Acquiring Jet.com Perhaps the biggest change Wal-Mart made this year was buying e-commerce start-up Jet.com for $3.3 billion, a record sum for an American e-commerce company. More than obtaining ownership of Jet.com itself, Wal-Mart seemed to be most interested in overhauling its own e-commerce operation, which it can now do with the help of Jet's "smart basket" algorithm, which gives customers the ability to lower prices, and with access to the mind of Jet.com Founder Marc Lore.    Wal-Mart pursued Lore's first company, Diapers.com parent Quidsi, but lost in a bidding war to Amazon in 2010. Lore spent two years at Amazon before leaving to start Jet.com, and he has now committed to spending five years at Wal-Mart.  Already, he is putting his stamp on the retail giant; it recently announced that several e-commerce executives would be leaving the company, and it lifted its online inventory from 8 million items to more than 20 million. With those changes and the expansion of its grocery pickup program, management expects online sales growth to accelerate to 20%-30% in the second half of the year, from just 8% in the first quarter.  3. Slowing down new store growth Wal-Mart plans to open just 59 new stores next year, which marks its slowest store expansion this century. Of those 59 stores, 20 will be Neighborhood Markets, the grocery-only stores that average about 40,000 square feet, four will be Sam's Clubs, and 35 will be Supercenters, some of which are conversions from Discount Stores, which lack a full grocery.  The plan is a marked divergence from Wal-Mart's historic strategy of blanketing the country with stores. With more than 5,000 locations including Sam's Clubs nationwide, Wal-Mart claims it has a store within five miles of 70% of the U.S. population. In other words, the marginal benefit of further penetrating the country has fallen, and the company can instead use its existing store network as a platform for e-commerce and to grow profits through increased same-store sales. Scaling back on new store openings allows the company to spend more money cleaning and improving stores and expand its grocery pickup program.  With Amazon shaping up as its principal rival, Wal-Mart is best off investing to attract customers to its existing stores and improve its e-commerce platform. Though the company sees flat profit growth next year after a decline this year, these moves are helping it become more competitive for the long term, which will ultimately benefit investors.

Menu Home Events Library Jobs Topics Newsletter Search Technology Trends Marketing E-commerce Payments Logistics Corporate News Loss Prevention Holidays Brief Wal-Mart denies urging workers not to download labor group app Author By Daphne Howland @daphnehowland • Published Nov. 16, 2016 Dive Brief: In an email to Retail Dive, Wal-Mart denied reports that it is discouraging employees from downloading WorkIt, an application developed by workers advocacy group OUR Walmart that employs IBM’s artificial intelligence bot Watson to answer questions about the retail giant's labor policies. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Wal-Mart is urging workers against using the WorkIt app, which leverages Watson machine learning tools to help employees better understand their benefits, rights and other labor issues. According to a internal Wal-Mart memo acquired by The Wall Street Journal, store managers contend that OUR Walmart (which is not officially a labor union) is “increasingly trying to get our associates to turn over personal information to the union by using deceptive and slick-looking social media and mobile app.” Dive Insight: In an email to Retail Dive, Wal-Mart Stores said employees can choose for themselves whether to use WorkIt, but want to be sure they realize it’s not an official Wal-Mart app, and that Wal-Mart has its own WalmartOne app for accessing company resources, employee information and social interaction tools. “This is a very busy time of year for our associates and they are receiving a lot of information from a lot of different sources,” Wal-Mart spokesperson Kory Lundberg said. “While they are focused on delivering a great holiday experience for our customers we want to make sure they know this app is not affiliated with Walmart. Our associates already have anytime-access online to the company’s most current and accurate Paid Time Off policies and there is no way to know if the details this group is pushing are correct.” Wal-Mart also said the WorkIt app poses potential privacy issues for workers. “Our people are smart and see this for what it is, an attempt by an outside group to collect as much personal and private information as possible,” Lundberg told Retail Dive. His statement didn't not address the internal memo obtained by The Wall Street Journal, however. OUR Walmart admits it is keen on amassing data about Wal-Mart’s policies and workers’ experiences, but notes that users of the WorkIt app can sign in anonymously; only their handpicked usernames are visible. In addition, there's no sharing of contacts or location data, and photo sharing is optional. (OUR Walmart developed WorkIt in partnership with Quadrant 2, a New York City-based company that has designed software for companies and activist organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union, which has worked to increase online privacy and transparency.) "Because [WorkIt is] an app from an outside group, people won't know what data and private information they collect or how they plan to use it," Lundgren said. "The WalmartOne app does not track people's social interaction — it connects people to the WalmartOne site, which works like any other social site — people can post new topics, comment on anything on the site, etc." Still, it's a rare app that doesn't collect information from users; usually it's a question of how upfront a company, organization or developer is about what exactly that entails. As of press time, Wal-Mart has not disclosed to Retail Dive whether WalmartOne collects user information in any way.

Ten days later, Microsoft made its largest wind-power purchase agreement ever, with a deal to buy 237 megawatts of electricity from turbines in Kansas and Wyoming to run data centers in Cheyenne. In between those announcements, Donald Trump was elected president, in part by calling climate change a hoax and vowing to gut most of Obama’s clean-energy policies and revive coal mining. If the actions of Walmart and Microsoft are any indication, a Trump administration will do little to dissuade companies from continuing to invest in renewables. “I think fears of a negative impact of Trump on renewable energy are really overblown,” says Thomas Emmons, a partner at Pegasus Capital Advisors, a private asset management firm focused on sustainable and alternative investments. One reason is timing. The biggest economic incentives for clean energy are federal tax credits for solar and wind projects. Both were set to expire at the end of last year, prompting a surge in investments as companies raced to get in under the deadline. In December, Congress unexpectedly extended both credits (for solar until 2021 and for wind until 2019) as part of a deal to lift the 40-year-old ban on U.S. oil exports. It’s not clear that Trump will try to persuade Congress to repeal the extensions. Wind power is especially popular across the Midwest, a Republican stronghold; in many cases it’s become cheaper than other sources of grid power. Sixty percent of Fortune 100 companies have renewable-electricity or climate change policies, and 81 companies globally have committed to get 100 percent of their energy from renewable sources, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Companies tend to invest in renewable energy in one of three ways: sourcing clean power from wind and solar projects through long-term agreements; purchasing a stake in green power projects; or using renewable-energy credits to offset the dirtier power they consume. Since 2008, U.S. companies have signed agreements to purchase more than $10 billion worth of wind and solar power— about 10Gw, enough to run almost 2 million U.S. households for a year. BNEF expects that pace to increase over the next decade, with at least 50 U.S. companies signing long-term agreements to buy an additional 22Gw of clean energy. “A Trump presidency does not lower our expectations for the growth of the corporate renewable-energy market,” says Nathan Serota, a clean-energy analyst at BNEF. “If anything, a less ambitious stance on renewables at the federal level could encourage corporations to pick up the slack even further.” With the government providing less support, more businesses may decide the best way to ensure clean-power projects get built is to sign long-term purchase agreements. That way, renewable developers have a guaranteed customer, ensuring they can finance new projects. These agreements are emerging as the preferred way to invest in clean energy. Locking in electricity prices for up to 15 years, the deals let companies hedge exposure to volatile natural gas and coal prices, which have historically determined wholesale power prices in the U.S. As wind and solar get cheaper, companies are able to lock in renewable power for less than the average wholesale power price, says Swami Venkataraman, senior vice president at Moody’s Investors Service. “Companies are investing in sustainability, not because they’re making a political statement, but because they have a fiduciary duty to protect shareholders and make money,” says Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a nonprofit sustainability advocate. Even if Trump rolls back Obama’s commitment to the Paris climate accord and his signature clean-energy initiative, the Clean Power Plan (CPP), which directs states to lower carbon emissions from power plants, it’s unlikely to influence investment decisions. “Renewable developers weren’t building a business model premised on the CPP,” Serota says. On Nov. 16, 300 U.S. businesses, including General Mills, EBay, and Intel, called on Trump to support the Paris accord. “The sustainable investing trend has global momentum and big players such as Goldman Sachs and Bill Gates,” said Amy Myers Jaffe, executive director for energy and sustainability at the University of California at Davis, in an e-mail. “Corporate America has lots of millennial customers, and they want to buy from companies with sustainable supply chains and a commitment to renewable energy. I don’t see that changing.” The bottom line: Companies should continue investing in renewables despite Trump’s promise to roll back clean-energy initiatives.

Here's how the company hopes it will pay off. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Nov 16, 2016 at 7:48PM Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is no one's idea of an innovator. For most of its recent history, the retail giant was known for its rapacious expansion, paying rock-bottom wages, and offering the lowest prices around. But that's changing now. Competition from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and, to a lesser extent, Costco Wholesale has forced Wal-Mart to rethink its longtime strategy. Image source: Wal-Mart.  Since CEO Doug McMillon took the helm in February 2014, the company has been fast adapting to the new retail landscape in order to keep up with competitors and changing customer habits. Let's take a look at a few of the major changes McMillon and Co. have made over the last year. 1. Raising wages  Wal-Mart sent shockwaves throughout the retail industry in early 2015 when it announced it would hike wages above the national minimum wage of $7.25. It raised its base wage to $9/hour in April 2015 and followed it up with another hike to $10/hour in February 2016. Wal-Mart also said it would invest in training to streamline promotions and reduce turnover.  Those wage hikes will cost the company $2.7 billion annually, but the decision appears to be paying off. Before it made the initial announcement, Wal-Mart's customer satisfaction was at the bottom of the industry, and it had poor internal store performance scores based on things like cleanliness and out-of-stocks. Now, the company is expected to report its ninth straight quarter of comparable sales growth this week -- a streak that did not start until McMillon took control -- and its second-quarter comp of 1.6% was its best in several years. 2. Acquiring Jet.com Perhaps the biggest change Wal-Mart made this year was buying e-commerce start-up Jet.com for $3.3 billion, a record sum for an American e-commerce company. More than obtaining ownership of Jet.com itself, Wal-Mart seemed to be most interested in overhauling its own e-commerce operation, which it can now do with the help of Jet's "smart basket" algorithm, which gives customers the ability to lower prices, and with access to the mind of Jet.com Founder Marc Lore.    Wal-Mart pursued Lore's first company, Diapers.com parent Quidsi, but lost in a bidding war to Amazon in 2010. Lore spent two years at Amazon before leaving to start Jet.com, and he has now committed to spending five years at Wal-Mart.  Already, he is putting his stamp on the retail giant; it recently announced that several e-commerce executives would be leaving the company, and it lifted its online inventory from 8 million items to more than 20 million. With those changes and the expansion of its grocery pickup program, management expects online sales growth to accelerate to 20%-30% in the second half of the year, from just 8% in the first quarter.  3. Slowing down new store growth Wal-Mart plans to open just 59 new stores next year, which marks its slowest store expansion this century. Of those 59 stores, 20 will be Neighborhood Markets, the grocery-only stores that average about 40,000 square feet, four will be Sam's Clubs, and 35 will be Supercenters, some of which are conversions from Discount Stores, which lack a full grocery.  The plan is a marked divergence from Wal-Mart's historic strategy of blanketing the country with stores. With more than 5,000 locations including Sam's Clubs nationwide, Wal-Mart claims it has a store within five miles of 70% of the U.S. population. In other words, the marginal benefit of further penetrating the country has fallen, and the company can instead use its existing store network as a platform for e-commerce and to grow profits through increased same-store sales. Scaling back on new store openings allows the company to spend more money cleaning and improving stores and expand its grocery pickup program.  With Amazon shaping up as its principal rival, Wal-Mart is best off investing to attract customers to its existing stores and improve its e-commerce platform. Though the company sees flat profit growth next year after a decline this year, these moves are helping it become more competitive for the long term, which will ultimately benefit investors.

Catalano was out shopping for furnishings for her 1st apartment as she goes into her senior year at St. Mary's of Notre Dame in South Bend. She is studying art education. (Stacey Wescott/Chicago Tribune) Washington Post Nov 18, 2016 at 4:40 pm | Print View The presidential election results may have changed a great many things: Your dinner table conversations, for example, and the kinds of posts in your Facebook feed. But executives at major retailers say they’re betting that the political climate will do little to alter your shopping habits this holiday season. “We haven’t really seen any noticeable change in sentiment in our customers,” said Greg Foran, Wal-Mart’s U.S. chief executive, on a Thursday conference call when asked whether the election would have an effect on the business. Foran’s comments echo what Brian Cornell, the chief executive of Target, said Wednesday when asked a similar question. “We remain very optimistic about the holiday season,” Cornell said, referring to economic factors such as a low unemployment rate. Both retailers reported relatively upbeat earnings results this week, adding to evidence that the retail industry is headed into the holiday shopping season with a tail wind. In its U.S. division, Wal-Mart saw a 1.2 percent increase in comparable sales, a measure of sales online and at stores open more than a year. The uptick came as the retailer did a better job of keeping store shelves well-stocked, and as its online sales heated up. This time around, e-commerce accounted for a greater share of the growth on this metric than in any previous quarter. Target reported improvement on some key measures: Foot traffic to its stores grew in the most recent quarter, and strong sales during the busy back-to-school shopping season helped narrow its decline in comparable sales. The retailer said it also has benefited from a recent change to its marketing tactics, in which it has moved to put a bigger spotlight on value and low prices. Macy’s and Kohl’s also reported stronger-than-expected earnings results last week. And the Commerce Department said Tuesday that retail sales were up 0.8 percent in October, a robust showing that suggests consumers are feeling relatively confident.

Friday, November 18, 2016 Share this Email, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn Discuss 5 comments Advertisement What does “Make America Great Again” really mean? MAGA was the slogan of the Donald Trump campaign. It was both inspirational and vague enough that citizens could project their individual ideas, hopes and dreams into it, much as citizens projected into Barack Obama's slogan “Yes We Can.” The Obama administration successfully met some aspirations and failed with others. The Trump administration? Time will tell. It looks like big chunks of the Trump coalition were looking for dramatic change, just as Bernie Sanders supporters were doing. The status quo simply wasn't tenable, not for people who'd grown up in the middle class, thanks to good-paying manufacturing jobs for their parents. Many of those jobs went away, across the border or overseas, leaving Mom and Dad working at Walmart or McDonald's and the kids struggling with college debt or camped out in the basement working minimum-wage jobs. There was tremendous anger at the establishment that allowed or encouraged the exodus of jobs in the name of free trade and globalization. Republicans were basically cheerleaders of the exodus because it made CEOs and investors richer. Democrats, those who weren't enablers of the exodus in the name of free trade, were ineffectual at stopping or even slowing the exodus of jobs. Retraining for guys who used to make $80,000 a year working the lines in Detroit, just so they could maybe make $30,000 a year in a service industry, just doesn't cut it. Then there was the role of retail giant Walmart, which not only destroyed Mom 'n Pop retail businesses on Main Street but also forced manufacturers to move factories to low-wage countries. (See Rubber Maid's well-documented experience with Walmart.) Reagan's assault on unions broke the link between ever-greater labor productivity with ever-better pay. NAFTA helped shatter the American Dream for millions. I suppose that if I could project my hopes onto MAGA, I'd opt for the Eisenhower era, when we had a booming and prosperous economy dominated by manufacturing. We built the inter-state, schools and suburbia for blue-collar families that enjoyed a social contract with owners/managers — I'll work hard and you'll provide a job for life and real hope for my kids. (Of course, all that was predicated on strong unions that had fought and bled for that prosperity, and a 92 percent highest tax rate on the 1 percent that paid off the costs incurred from the Great Depression and World War II. It was also predicated on the fact that the industrial world, save the US, was just emerging from the ruins of that war.) Did you know that right now, there's a prosperous, Western, liberal, capitalist country that has a robust economy dominated by manufacturing, one that has never shipped jobs and factories overseas? Germany copied our best management practices after the war. Labor unions are strong and work closely with management/owners. Germany enjoys trade surpluses with the rest of the world. Jobs are kept at home and immigration provides a labor supply as birth rates decline. As a result, blue-collar Germans enjoy excellent pay and benefits and virtually lifelong employment. German factories are opened overseas, not to replace shuttered factories at home but to expand market share abroad. And German CEOs don't make 300 to 400 times what a worker on the line makes. More like 30 times, so Germany doesn't have a 1 percent that dominates politics with campaign contributions, like our own Koch brothers. So why can't we be more like Germany? What do you want MAGA to mean?

MAGA is just a slogan Trumpy used to rile up the gullible. The world is moving forward. Technology is moving so fast that workers can't keep up with the jobs needed. In the words of the Prophet: "Them steady jobs are goin' forth and they ain't comin' back". Back to the 50s? Are you kidding?

Maybe, as opposed to taxing labor, we restructure how the system works and tax goods sold. That way, products are not made to be disposable, taxes on goods sold does not replace the displacement of labor in favor of technology and many other things the fair tax would help solve, versus the current system that really works against human labor being employed in this country - in favor of technology or outsourcing.

Small parts manufacturers then face taxes trying to supply another manufacturer. It makes more sense to tax labor as the job exists and the labor is being paid because something useful is being done. Otherwise, trying to tax the "goods" of knowledge jobs becomes arbitrary. The 50s were great for the US because most of the world's major economies were rebuilding what had been destroyed. That isn't going to happen again. With Obama in Peru there are articles on trade and the future of trade agreements with the USA. There is a certain level of "it doesn't matter" in Peru because they will export to China or whomever is willing to sign a bilateral trade deal. USA won't have additional jobs if we don't import artichokes grown in the opposite season as in the USA. What Germany has been doing well is connecting their education system to companies so that students are trained for the available jobs. USA has all sorts of openings for various skilled jobs, but lacks the qualified people to take those jobs. We have a trillion dollars in student debt and yet a shortage college graduates qualified to fill good paying skilled jobs.

New figures released show that foot traffic to branches is also down, with "branch banker interactions" down 22 percent from 2015. The figures come in the wake of a sales practice scandal that triggered multiple lawsuits, an enormous $185 million fine and the resignation of the company's longtime CEO John Stumpf.

Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 68.54 -0.65 -0.94% SPX Corp SPXC ▲ 23.20 +0.29 +1.27% “For holiday and fourth quarter, we expect Walmart to continue to excel on multiple fronts, particularly online where we expect sales to continue to accelerate on a percentage basis, with a growth rate approaching 30% likely as it leverages its store network to handle online orders, especially via its buy online/pick-up in-store capability, as well as increasing benefits from Jet.com,” said Charlie O’Shea, lead retail analyst at Moody’s. Wal-Mart (WMT) reported a 20.6% increase in global e-commerce sales on a constant-currency basis for the third quarter. Moody’s puts Wal-Mart’s online sales growth on a base of $14 billion to $15 billion, without a full quarter of Jet.com results. Total revenue for the third quarter was $118.2 billion, up from $117.4 billion last year, but falling short of the FactSet consensus of $118.6 billion. Earnings per share were 98 cents, down from $1.03 last year, but ahead of the 96-cent FactSet estimate. =Wal-Mart added eight million SKUs (stock keeping units) to the website over the past three months, Chief Executive Doug McMillion said Thursday in his prepared remarks. And e-commerce added 50 basis points to the retailer’s third-quarter U.S. same-store sales figure, “which is our largest contribution yet,” he added. Walmart U.S. same-store sales increased 1.2% in the third quarter, driven by a 0.7% traffic increase, Wal-Mart said. Wal-Mart announced a strategic alliance with Chinese e-commerce company JD.com this summer, that included the sale of its Yihaodian website to JD.com. See also: Wal-Mart’s deal with China’s JD.com may be copied by others The partners announced that they were launching three new initiatives in late October. Wal-Mart has also invested in New Dada, a Chinese on-demand logistics and grocery e-commerce platform, McMillon said in his remarks. New Dada is making two-hour delivery service from 45 Walmart locations possible. Wal-Mart announced that it was acquiring Jet.com for $3 billion in August. Jet.com founder Marc Lore took over Wal-Mart’s e-commerce operations earlier this month.  Neil Saunders, chief executive of retail research agency and consulting firm Conlumino, believes Wal-Mart’s U.S. online growth “is now well above the overall market,” which indicates they’re adding share. But there are other factors playing a role in the result. “The figures include half a quarter of sales from recently acquired Jet.com, which flatters the results somewhat,” said Saunders in a note published Thursday. “Nonetheless, we believe that Walmart is now on much more positive trajectory in terms of both its e-commerce strategy and results.” Walmart's Strategy on Food Safety and Affordability Frank Yiannas, vice president of Food Safety at Walmart Stores, discusses the strategy for reducing risk and providing consumers with safe, affordable foods at America's largest grocery chain. He spoke with WSJ's Sarah Nassauer at the WSJ Global Food Forum in New York.  “We view the same-store sales growth as evidence that Wal-Mart’s investment in labor, e-commerce and marketing its value message are working,” said The Buckingham Research Group in a note published Thursday. “However, some investors may be disappointed that traffic and comps decelerated slightly from fiscal second-quarter 2016.” Wal-Mart highlighted food deflation, weather and currency impacts among the headwinds. Wal-Mart shares are up 11.8% for the year so far while the S&P 500 index (SPX) is up 6.7% for the same period. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is up 8.3% for 2016 so far.

Construction of the new 154,400 SF store is under the supervision of one of the most prolific and respected construction firms on the West Coast. Deacon Corp started in a tiny, borrowed office space in a small office building in southwest Portland in 1981. Steve Deacon and his wife were the company along with three friends. Since those early days Deacon Corp has grown to employ about 400 people who work out of offices in Seattle, Portland, Sacramento, Pleasanton and Irvine. According to the company website there is no headquarters and little in the way of hierarchy. The management structure seems to be working very well as Deacon has developed some iconic retail outlets over the years. Their project portfolio includes Portland’s flagship IKEA store, Cascade Plaza just off Airport Way at PDX, Seattle Premium Outlets in Marysville, 200 Target stores along the West coast, REI stores and The Woodburn Outlet Mall, just to name a few. In 2013 Deacon was named the #1 retail contractors in California and that same year the Woodburn Outlet Mall honored Deacon with an outstanding service award. In the industry they are noted for being able to smoothly coordinate multiple sub-contractors to successfully complete projects from small to very large. As for the Warrenton project, there was a quiet groundbreaking held last week and crews started to work on site development. By Friday morning Deacon signs were posted and a large construction trailer appeared on the site. The beginnings of an access road was taking shape and containment systems and been installed along the Highway frontage. The detailed drawings of the project indicate the store will have a grocery section with a bakery and deli. Plans also call for a garden supply shop, pharmacy, vision center and a tire and car battery section. All this is according to the bid plans for the project. ©2016 Ohana Media Group EEOC

A bunch of us waiting were from Bella Vista. The driver was nearly 20 minutes late, and it was getting cold. That was the beginning of an adventure early Sunday evening. One gal waiting was becoming impatient. She was tempted, as I have been in the past, to get on a bus that goes to Universal Drive first before it comes back to Bella Vista (the D14 bus). We persuaded her to wait since this would have taken longer to get home. Finally our D5 came. We got on. One person was still waiting to get on; he was confined to a wheelchair. I didn’t know him. Some of the women I got on with were chatting away. I could hear one talking about the uses of banana peels. I wasn’t sitting close enough, so all I heard her say was that she got rid of a wart with banana peels.  I didn’t know what to think of that. All I could think about was wanting to get home after standing outside in the cold and the dark. Eventually I realized that the bus driver was on his phone for quite some time having a very serious conversation with CT Transit. We were not going anywhere. A man in a wheelchair was waiting to get on the bus. The doors to the bus were open, and we were still cold because of it. Eventually the bus driver got off the bus and stood outside with his hands in his pockets, not saying anything to any of us. All we knew was that we were not going anywhere, and we didn’t know why. Then I saw him on his cell phone. Frustrated, wanting to know what was happening, I got off the bus to find out. I waited until he hung up his cell and then walked over to him and asked him why we were not going anywhere. He said, “I heard a passenger say they have ‘ebola’ and we can’t go anywhere until this is taken care of.” “No one has ebola,” I said. “A woman was talking about banana peels.” “Ohhhhhhh,” he said “I thought someone was ill.” He looked confused and then said again he thought someone was ill. I reiterated that the woman was talking about helpful uses for banana peels and that no one had ebola. “Forget about this,” he said, still looking serious and a bit embarrassed. I got back on the bus, and everyone wanted to know what he said. “It’s not worth repeating,” I said. That made everyone push me to tell what transpired , so I said without using the name of the illness, “The bus driver thought he heard someone say they were sick, and that‘s why we‘re not going anywhere.” Now the passengers were more confused and asked for more information. Eventually I told them the full story. Everyone was laughing. Some decided that the driver was a germaphobe and crazy. We still had to wait for the bus driver’s supervisor to come. After she arrived, the two of them chatted for quite some time. Inside the bus and watching them, I once again wondered why it was still taking so long. So again I got off the bus and approached the two of them. The supervisor looked like a nice gal; none of this was her doing. I smiled at her. She smiled back. I started to ask if we could get going. As the words were on the tip of my tongue, they ended their conversation and started helping the man in the wheelchair onto the bus, which took another five minutes. This whole event must have taken about 45 minutes; plus, the bus was running 20 minutes late to start with. I finally got home with my banana-peel-informed neighbor from Bella Vista. As we got off the bus we were laughing about the whole circumstance but were mainly glad to be home. She told me that banana peel can even whiten your teeth.  I’ve never known a dentist to share this information, nor did I ever see banana peels advertised on TV as a teeth whitener. I had to Google it — and sure enough I found it! My neighbor was right — one can even shine their shoes with banana peels! I called the bus company Monday hoping for a report from the previous evening’s events. The operator I spoke with checked and said that there wasn’t any kind of information pertinent to the event I experienced. I asked her if it is typical that a report is filed when a supervisor has to come out. No there is not, she said. There is a report filed only when there is a complaint. I wish I had filed a complaint, because this was purely nutty and it held up a lot of people on a Sunday evening. Monday Evening’s Ride   At the end of the next day, Monday, I was waiting for a D bus at the stop on Chapel Street right after Foot Locker going toward Fair Haven. I get on at Chapel and State. I got in a D13 bus at the corner of Chapel and State (opposite Elm City Market) around 5:30 p.m.. The bus was packed. As I put my ticket in the fare box, I heard someone say the word “doo.” Then I saw people pointing to a completely empty seat.“You can’t sit there,” one said. “Someone went to the bathroom on the seat.” As I moved farther into the bus I smelled the “doo.” Some folks were holding their noses. It was gross. (I didn’t see any “doo,” though.) I didn’t know where I was going to sit. Then a kind woman motioned for me to sit on the inside of her seat. She was holding a spray bottle of cleaner and paper towels. How she knew to come prepared, I don’t know. I asked her what happened. She said someone had an accident on the seat … which I could smell, yet when I looked over at the seat there wasn‘t anything there except the smell that told the story. The windows of the bus were open. As we rode along, fresh air eventually cleared the smell out. When the gal with the paper towels next to me got off the bus, a young man from the back came over and sat down. I asked him if he knew what happened but he really didn’t know, either. He surmised that someone had an accident and got off the bus right afterwards. As I exited the bus, I tried one last time. I asked the driver if she knew what happened.  She looked weary and shook her head. Shari Hoffman lives at Bella Vista and regularly rides CT Transit buses.

Have no fear. We've put together a list for you.

(Photo: Michael Zamora/The Register)Buy Photo Eager to put the election behind them, consumers are expected to spend with enthusiasm this holiday shopping season, with retailers expecting Thanksgiving and Black Friday sales to outpace previous years. "Influence from the election was a distraction," said Marshal Cohen, a retail analyst with New York-based NPD Group. "But now we see that half the country is happy and ready to get back to spending, while the other half is sad and in need of some retail therapy." Consumers are expected to spend an average of $935.58 each during the holiday shopping season, including $588.90 on gifts and $207.07 for items such as food, decorations, flowers and greeting cards, according to a National Retail Federation survey. They will spend the remaining $139.61 on themselves, the survey showed. Shoppers insistent on getting the best bargains will be out in force on Black Friday, said C. Britt Beemer, chairman of the consumer behavior marketing company America's Research Group. DES MOINES REGISTER Mall of America to close on Thanksgiving. Are Iowa malls next? In a recent telephone survey, Beemer found that 40 percent of people said they would be shopping on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, especially if there are door-buster deals and deep discounts advertised. Most people believe that “the only time to get the super deals is on the Black Friday holiday weekend,” he said. Shoppers already have been previewing Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday advertisements that have been published or leaked online. But most will pore over newspaper ads that come out the day before Thanksgiving, Beemer said. Overall, retail sales are expected to be up 2.5 percent this holiday season over last, Beemer predicted. Discount retailers likely will be the winners of the season, said Cohen. "Mass merchants like Target and Wal-Mart are in the right position because of their value, full assortment and early and aggressive promotions. Department stores are the most vulnerable," he said.

USA TODAY NETWORK Here's what else you can expect for the holiday shopping season: Online shopping growing Perhaps eager to avoid the crowds, more shoppers are opting to buy their holiday gifts and other items online. For the first time, online spending will equal in-store shopping, according to the Deloitte Consulting holiday shopping survey. Two-thirds of shoppers said they will research items online and then buy them in a store, according to the Deloitte survey. About half said they planned to check out items in the stores and then shop for better prices online. Smartphones are helping people shop in greater numbers. Survey respondents said they will use their smartphones to locate stores, compare prices, read reviews, browse for items, get coupons, check for availability and make purchases, according to Deloitte. DES MOINES REGISTER Deals and duds in the search for Black Friday savings Filling out the ranks Retailers traditionally pump up their employment ranks during the holiday shopping season to handle the shopping onslaught. This year, companies such as Target, Kohl’s, Younkers and others are hiring about the same number of extra workers as last year. Delivery and mail-order companies such as United Parcel Service and Amazon are adding more jobs this season to help with increased online shopping. "The sector with the biggest increase in holiday hiring in recent years has been transportation and warehousing, as more and more holiday shopping is done online," John Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. And while companies such as Target and BonTon Stores Inc. (parent company of Younkers) have held steady with their number of holiday workers in stores this year, they are adding more help in their distribution centers, Challenger said.

Comb the ads and circulars for the best deals. Don’t forget online retailers, who also advertise deals. Here are some more tips from Consumer Reports: Shoppers can do comparison shopping on sites such as FatWallet, PriceGrabber.com, PriceWatch.com, Shopping.com, Google Shopping and NexTag.com. Retailers sometimes will have unique model numbers or product names, making direct price comparisons difficult. Retailers' loyalty programs can offer sales, coupons and discounts to members. Also, remember to check retailers’ social media sites, including Facebook and Twitter, to get notices of deals. Avoid overspending by creating a budget and sticking to it. Curb impulse buys and use cash to avoid credit cards. Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share The online retailer plans to add deals every five minutes from now until December 22nd.

More than half of all consumers say at least some of the presents they plan to give this year will be gift cards, according to a survey from Bankrate, a consumer finance website. But only 27 percent of those surveyed preferred receiving a gift card over an actual gift at the holidays, according to Bankrate. The Iowa Attorney General's Office offers some tips on buying and using gift cards: Gift cards cannot expire for at least five years after the card purchase date, or from the last date a consumer added additional funds onto the card. The expiration date must be clearly disclosed on the card. The merchant or institution offering the card cannot charge inactivity fees until the card has not been used for at least a year, and can charge only one fee per month. All fees must be clearly disclosed on the package. Be wary of purchasing gift cards from online auction sites, because the cards may have been used or may be fraudulent. 8 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/2g5Bg7J

(Seeking Alpha) Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) reported Q3 results before market open on Thursday, and the shares ticked lower over the trading day. Rating And Price Target Looking past the retail giant’s mixed results and soft guidance, Baird Equity Research analyst Peter S. Benedict maintained both his Outperform rating for the retail giant and his $80 price target. Justification The analyst cited the following as key reasons behind his maintained rating: Tightly controlled inventory. An EPS in line with estimates. Accelerated e-commerce sales. “Respectable” comparables performance. Outlook. Wal-Mart saw global e-commerce sales up 20.6 percent, compared with Q2’s 11.8 percent increase and an “even stronger growth” in the United States, according to Benedict. “When combined with WMT's defensive appeal within a still choppy consumer/retail backdrop, we remain Outperform-rated,” said Benedict. At time of writing, Wal-Mart shares were trading at $68.72.

"Following" : "Follow"}} November 18, 2016 8:34am   Comments Share: Related WMT Wal-Mart Remains Barclays' Top Pick Despite Mixed Results Wal-Mart's Soft Q4 Guidance Doesn't Rock Baird Analyst's Positive View Buffett Sold Most Of His Wal-Mart, Should You? (Seeking Alpha) Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) reported an earnings beat for its fiscal third quarter of 2017. Although comps narrowly missed expectations, they “may have beat had it not been for unusually warm weather which hurt apparel and other sales,” Barclays’ Karen Short said in a report. She maintains an Overweight rating on the company, with a price target of $82. Wal-Mart reported its quarterly EPS at $0.98, versus Barclays’ estimate of $0.97. EPS benefited from a one-off gain and a lower tax rate. Short reduced the EPS estimates for Q4 and FY 2017 from $1.18 to $1.25 and from $4.33 to $4.27, respectively, citing lower comps and operating margin at Wal-Mart U.S., weaker international revenue and higher expenses. 5 Positives And 4 Negatives Short highlighted the positives from the quarter: Steady traffic growth at Wal-Mart U.S. A larger basket size driven by Fresh. A 32bps gross margin expansion at Wal-Mart U.S., despite tough comps and price investment. Accelerated in e-commerce GMV growth to 28.6 percent year-over-year. A 6 percent decline in Wal-Mart U.S. comp store inventory. The analyst's negatives: An expected slowdown in Wal-Mart U.S. comps in Q4. A 130bps rise in SG&A rate at Wal-Mart U.S. Weaker-than-expected operating income at Sam's Club. International segment facing continued currency headwinds. In Friday's pre-market session, Wal-Mart was up 0.13 percent at $69.28.

The National Retail Federation expects consumers to spend an average of $935.58 over the holidays this year, including gifts for others, self-gifting, food, flowers, decorations and greeting cards for Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa. That's second only to last year's all-time NRF record of $952.58. (Marvin Fong, Plain Dealer file) Print Email Janet H. Cho, The Plain Dealer By Janet H. Cho, The Plain Dealer The Plain Dealer Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 18, 2016 at 8:36 AM, updated November 20, 2016 at 12:58 PM comments CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Retailers have spent months preparing for the coming week of shopping from Thanksgiving through Black Friday and Small Business Saturday, hoping that their clever promotions and carefully selected merchandise will be just the thing to draw eager shoppers into their stores and ready to spend. Some are hoping that consumers who were anxious about the presidential election will welcome the invitation to brighten other people's holidays with some retail therapy, and strengthen the economy heading into the new year. Q. Is Black Friday really the busiest shopping day of the year? A. Not always, but this year, it very well might be. ShopperTrak, the Chicago-based technology company that tracks foot traffic, buying patterns, and transaction size, says the top three shopping days for 2016 will be: Black Friday (Nov. 25), the Monday right after Christmas (Dec. 26), and the Friday before Christmas Eve (Dec. 23). "This year, we are dubbing Dec. 17 'Super Saturday' because we expect it to be the busiest Saturday of December," said Brian Field, ShopperTrak's senior director of advisory services, in a statement. "However, it will be no match for Black Friday, which will be the busiest shopping day of the holiday season."  ShopperTrak says Dec. 17 will be the fourth busiest shopping day of the year. On the other hand, Foursquare, which tracks more than 50 million mobile users a month as they trek to malls, boutiques and big-box stores, says Black Friday as a whole has been losing steam for years as people spread out their shopping over the entire holiday season. Foursquare expects Black Friday foot traffic will be down 3.5 percent from last year. Related Plain Dealer coverage: Black Friday 2016 doorbusters try to tempt holiday shoppers to buy early and often Black Friday shoppers are already camped out at Best Buy stores in Florida and Arizona More retailers closing this Thanksgiving, postponing their sales to Black Friday Q. Why is it even called "Black Friday"? A. Traditionally, the Friday after Thanksgiving marked the beginning of the holiday shopping season, as well as when retailers that had been operating "in the red" started raking in profits, or running "in the black." Now, with mass merchandizers like Walmart announcing their lists of the hottest holiday toys as early as Sept. 1, the Christmas shopping season starts a lot earlier than it used to. After Walmart, rival Toys 'R' Us came out with its own #TRUhottoylist on Sept. 8. And while many retailers do make 25 percent to 45 percent of their annual sales in the final quarter, which includes Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa, if they actually had to wait until the end of November to become profitable, most of them wouldn't be able to stay open the rest of the year. Q. So why are so many stores opening their doors on Thanksgiving? A. Because Black Friday shoppers with fat wallets and long shopping lists tend to spend the most money at the first store they hit, retailers all compete to become that first stop, by opening their doors earlier and earlier.  In 2008, Kohl's and JCPenney opened at 4 a.m. to get a jump on the stores that opened at 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. By 2013, many stores were open at 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving, and this year, JCPenney is opening at 3 p.m. Thanksgiving Day.  ShopperTrak and other retail observers are skeptical that opening on Thanksgiving is worth the cost of opening that day. The Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, the nation's largest shopping center with more than 520 stores and restaurants, made headlines when it announced on Oct. 5 that it would stay closed this Thanksgiving. "Based on our findings, it's clear that Thanksgiving Day openings may risk more in operating costs than in expanding sales opportunities," Field. "Not to mention, opening on Thanksgiving has serious implications on staff morale." Locally, both Beachwood Place Mall and Ohio Station Outlets in Lodi are staying closed for Thanksgiving, although individual stores might open early. Q. But are the deals really worth camping out for? A. Depends on what you think of what's being offered. Retailers try to tempt early shoppers by offering them the biggest discounts on limited quantity big-ticket items, such as appliances, jewelry and flat-screen TVs, and by giving extra goodies to the first ones in line. NerdWallet, a personal finance website out of San Francisco, said that when it compared the promotions from Black Friday 2016 to 2015, it found that many major retailers like JCPenney, Best Buy, and Kohl's do offer lower prices on Thanksgiving and Black Friday than they do the rest of the holiday season.  On the other hand, NerdWallet said, it noticed that at least 32 retailers are repeating at least one Black Friday deal from 2015. Ohio Station Outlets in Lodi is giving the first 200 shoppers at its guest services office at 6 a.m. on Black Friday a $15 gift certificate redeemable at any outlet store. Plus, it is giving away Roku Express streaming media players to the first 100 shoppers with $275 or more in same-day receipts. Q. What kinds of stores do well on Black Friday? A. Foursquare says online and in-store promotions, warmer-than-usual temperatures, and how people feel about the election all factor into shopping decisions, but it expects the number of shoppers hitting big-box stores to increase 5 percent this year. Columbus-based "Big Lots will see the largest spike in the big-box category on Black Friday 2016, and Dollar Tree will be the leaders for the discount category -- with gains that will be even more pronounced closer to Christmas," Foursquare said in a written announcement. Among department stores, it predicts Marshall's, Dillard's and Macy's will see the largest increase in foot traffic. Q. What about Small Business Saturday? A. Mass merchandisers and discount stores with large advertising budgets do have an edge over small retailers on Black Friday, but American Express and local businesses are hoping consumers will still eat and shop locally on Small Business Saturday and beyond. The Merchants of Hudson, which includes more than 90 shops and restaurants, is holding a Celebration of Lights and Caroling from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Black Friday. And the nonprofit Ten Thousand Villages in Cleveland Heights, which sells fair-trade crafts and gifts made by artisans in developing countries, is welcoming a cash mob of local shoppers who have pledged to spend at least $20 each, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Nov. 19. Q. What are retailers expecting this holiday shopping season? A. Retailers are always optimistic about holiday spending. The National Retail Federation expects consumers to spend an average of $935.58 over the holidays, according to surveys conducted by Prosper Insights. That amount, which includes gifts for others, self-gifting, food, flowers, decorations and greeting cards for Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa, is second only to last year's all-time NRF record of $952.58. NRF says holiday spending over November and December is supposed to increase 3.6 percent to $655.8 billion. That includes a 7 percent to 10 percent spike in online sales, up to $117 billion. Some retail experts said uncertainty about the presidential election was making consumers more cautious, but it's unclear if the prospect of President-Elect Donald Trump will make people spend more or less this December. Perhaps that's why nearly six in 10 shoppers NRF surveyed said they were planning to splurge on themselves, spending an average of $139.61 on self indulgences, 4 percent more than last year.

(CSCO) Stock The market somewhat knew CSCO was shifting its approach By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Nov 18, 2016, 6:00 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: 10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in 2017 The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2016 Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is Just a One-Hit Wonder Recent Posts: Why Gap Inc (GPS), Hibbett Sports, Inc. (HIBB) and First Solar, Inc. (FSLR) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks 5 Retail Stocks That May Not Be Around Next Christmas Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF) Stock Is Beyond All Hope View All Posts Most of the headlines are tilted bullishly, suggesting Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is a buy today, with CSCO stock selling off to the tune of 5%. Those bullish calls are supported by rather sound arguments too, not the least of which implores investors to look beyond just one quarter. And yet, those headlines arguably oversimplify the uncertainty current and would-be owners of Cisco stock face today. On the one hand, the disappointing first fiscal quarter of 2017 doesn’t necessarily reflect the product/service mix that CSCO stock will be sporting a year or two from now. On the other hand, two key product categories showed decided weakness for the company last quarter, and there’s nothing Cisco can do to re-inflate demand on those fronts. Investors have a lot to think about here. Cisco Stock: A Tale of Transition For the quarter ending in October, CSCO earned 61 cents per share on revenue of $12.35 billion. Both figures topped analyst estimates for a bottom line of 59 cents per share of CSCO and sales of $12.33 billion. 7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Are Due for a Reckoning So why the sharp selloff from Cisco stock? It’s partly a response to the fact that the networking giant drove $12.68 billion in revenue for the same quarter a year earlier. It’s mostly the result, however, of a lackluster outlook and poor results from CSCO’s core business lines. Sales for its telecom service provider division were particularly poor, falling 12% on a year-over-year basis. Its switching business as a whole fell 7% during fiscal Q1. The lull represents a macro headwind, according to CEO Chuck Robbins, who explained that “[some customers have] just stopped spending as they tried to figure out what is going on in their business.” The macro headwind isn’t just in Robbins’ head either — others are seeing it too. Pacific Crest analysts Alex Kurtz and Steve Enders commented after Wednesday evening’s report: “Despite the setback in the U.S. service provider market, which appears unrelated to product or competitive positioning … we would see any material pullback in the stock as a buying opportunity.” The question is, how long will the macro headwind last? Nobody seems to know for sure. Needham Co analyst Alex Henderson thinks it’s going to persist for a few more quarters. Cisco at least partially obliged by forecasting a 2% to 4% revenue decline for the quarter currently underway. Either way, it’s a shift that’s been underway for longer than most CSCO stock investors recognize. The shift is also one of the key reasons Cisco has been moving toward a software and service-oriented business model that drives more recurring revenue. The company demonstrated progress on that front too. Last quarter, service revenue grew 7%, and security revenue was up 11%. CSCO aims to add cloud-computing management and security to its ‘campus’ portfolio of products within a year. The Real Problem With CSCO Stock It’s all a step in the right direction. As yesterday’s hardware functions are increasingly virtualized and technological leaps become more difficult to muster, Cisco must make that move to be competitive.

Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen emphasized that the Fed plans to raise interest rates, which will help banks make more money from lending. Stocks started the day with small gains and moved higher following Yellen's testimony to Congress. Banks once again marched higher as investors cheered the latest indication that interest rates will rise from their current ultra-low levels. Retailers also rose after strong earnings from Best Buy, while food and household goods makers struggled after weak results from Wal-Mart and J.M. Smucker. Almost all of the S&P 500's gains since the presidential election have gone to financial stocks. They lagged the market for much of this year, but they're now trading at their highest levels since May 2008, months before the financial crisis peaked. Investors hope banks will benefit from higher interest rates, faster economic growth and lighter regulation under President-elect Trump. "I wouldn't expect we're going to see the entire repeal of Dodd-Frank, but we could certainly see some changes that are positive for the financial services sector," said Kate Warne, an investment strategist for Edward Jones. The Dow Jones industrial average added 35.68 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,903.82. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 10.18 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,187.12. The Nasdaq composite added 39.39 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,333.97. The Dow has set several records since the election, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are close to records they set a few months ago. Fed Chair Yellen told Congress that the economy is improving and added that that if the Fed keeps waiting now and raises rates too quickly later, that increases the risk of a recession. Investors already expected the Fed to raise interest rates when it meets in mid-December, and they felt Yellen's comments confirmed that higher rates are coming. Bond prices slipped. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 2.29 percent from 2.22 percent. Bond yields rise when investors expect higher interest rates and inflation. Bank of America gained 33 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $20.08 and PNC Financial Services climbed $3.09, or 2.9 percent, to $110.60. Greater sales of mobile phones and increased online sales helped electronics retailer Best Buy post a strong third quarter, and the company forecast a larger fourth-quarter profit than analysts had expected. Its stock climbed $5.54, or 13.7 percent, to $45.99 and hit a six-year high. Other retailers also rose. Home Depot recovered some recent losses and added $3.60, or 2.9 percent, to $128.93. Amazon also gained ground as Wal-Mart struggled. It picked up $9.91, or 1.3 percent, to $756.40. "Instead of spending in traditional ways, consumers have decided to spend their additional dollars in technology and online shopping," Warne said. Wal-Mart announced disappointing sales in its third quarter. The retailer's profit also fell as it invested more money in its stores and its online business. The stock lost $2.20, or 3.1 percent, to $69.19 Warehouse club operator Costco and grocery store chain Kroger both took small losses as well. Jam and jellies maker J.M. Smucker disclosed weak sales and its stock shed $5.10, or 3.9 percent, to $124.85. Tyson Foods fell $2.32, or 3.4 percent, to $66.70. Cisco Systems fell after its earnings forecast disappointed Wall Street. The seller of routers, switches, software and services forecast a smaller-than-expected profit for its second fiscal quarter. That canceled out a strong first-quarter report. The stock gave up $1.52, or 4.8 percent, to $30.05. Oil refining company Tesoro will buy Western Refining for $37.30 a share in stock, a deal the companies valued at $4.1 billion. The stock closed at $30.50 on Wednesday, and it jumped $7.05, or 23.1 percent, to $37.55. Tesoro shares rose 82 cents, or 1 percent, to $86.56. Higher interest rates also mean a stronger dollar. The dollar climbed to 109.89 yen from 109.15 yen. The euro fell to $1.0626 from $1.0681. The ICE U.S. dollar index continued to rise. It's at its highest level in 13 years. Benchmark U.S. crude slid 15 cents to $45.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slipped 14 cents to $46.49 a barrel in London. Energy companies lagged the market after big gains earlier this week.

Ross Aynami, 32, of Chicago was ordered held on $60,000 bail Thursday. Prosecutors say he was captured on video at other Wal-Mart stores using gift cards he fraudulently obtained through information he acquired from neighbors. According to Cook County Assistant State's Attorney Maureen McGee, Aynami used the information to obtain gift cards, which he then sold to a Chicago currency exchange in exchange for money orders payable to him and his wife. Aynami used the stolen information to make 35 transactions totaling about $13,000, McGee said. At his home, Mount Prospect police recovered hundreds of gift cards whose balances totaled $9,200, McGee said. Police also recovered a credit card reader, blank credit cards and phony driver's licenses, she said. Aynami next appears in court on Dec. 9.

(Okanagan Gleaners/Facebook) Related Stories 'Justice for blemished fruit': How some B.C. companies are fighting global food waste Rebel Soup enrolls in B.C.'s battle against food waste 6 foods with unexpected health benefits Walmart insider says 'heartbreaking' amount of food dumped in trash How Canada sucks at reducing food waste Food waste has been declared a global challenge by the United Nations, and over the past year, some B.C. entrepreneurs have stepped up to make use of second-grade produce that often ends up in landfills. 'Justice for blemished fruit': How some B.C. companies are fighting global food waste But for Oliver's Greg Masson, finding a home for blemished fruits and veggies is nothing new. In fact, his organization Okanagan Gleaners has been doing it for 20 years — and fighting world hunger in the process. The organization collects excess fruits and vegetables that would otherwise end up in a landfill due to aesthetic issues that keep them from making it to supermarket shelves. The team dehydrates them, turns them into dry vegetable soup mix and ships them to different charities around the world. "When we started in 1996, we were able to produce 100,000 servings of soup," Masson told host Sheryl MacKay on CBC's North by Northwest. "In 2016, we were able to provide 6.8 million servings of soup." Masson says when a large group of volunteers are at it, production can look a bit like organized chaos. (Okanagan Gleaners/Facebook) In the last year alone, Okanagan Gleaners has fed people in Ethiopia, Guatemala, Ukraine, Fiji, Swaziland and Lesotho. The small non-profit society works directly with local farmers, who donate fruits and veggies that aren't appealing to common consumers even though there's really nothing wrong with the products. Food waste costs Canada $31B a year, report says Walmart insider says 'heartbreaking' amount of food dumped in trash "The abundance of produce that the farmers are donating to us — what they donate to us is produce that is either too big for market, too small, too ripe or not ripe enough. It could be a green pepper that's got red and yellow on it," said Masson. "We've had some onions that are beach ball sizes — people won't buy them that big," said Masson.  Masson says the group couldn't operate without the generosity of the farmers and the large pool of volunteers who try to make it whenever they can. In the latest year of production, the team at Okanagan Gleaners made 6.8 million servings of soup. (Okanagan Gleaners/Facebook) "We had a low of nine a day, and we had a high of 70. We have no idea how many people are going to help us out on any given day," he said. He admits that when there's a crowd of volunteers, production can be a bit chaotic — but they're all there with the same goal: to help someone in need.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 18 November 2016 Ahold Delhaize profit misses estimates on US deflation AMSTERDAM: Royal Ahold Delhaize NV reported earnings below analysts’ estimates as the first results since a merger were overshadowed by the impact of deflation on the grocer’s Food Lion stores in the US. Underlying operating income rose 4.3% to 513 million euros (US$549mil) in the third quarter, the Zaandam, Netherlands-based owner of the US Stop & Shop chain said in a statement yesterday. Analysts expected 520 million euros. Sales growth in the US decelerated as rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc slashed prices. The stock fell as much as 3.8% in early trading in Amsterdam. “The US was slightly worse than anticipated, with a more difficult trading and deflationary environment,” ING analyst Matthias Maenhaut said. Ahold and Delhaize merged this year amid heightened competition in the US from supermarket giants such as Wal-Mart and from low-cost grocers in Europe. The combined company gets almost two-thirds of sales from the US, which has turned into its slowest-growing region. Chief executive officer Dick Boer said deflation won’t let up in that market in the fourth quarter. Shares of US supermarket operators dropped Wednesday after producer-price index data signalled that food deflation will continue to squeeze grocers’ profit. Using constant exchange rates, third-quarter sales growth in the US slowed to 2.4% at Ahold and 1.1% at Delhaize. The company forecast full-year profitability slightly ahead of last year’s, when the underlying operating margin was 3.5%. That margin widened to 3.6% from 3.4% in the first nine months of the year. “The outlook is not very engaging,” wrote Antoine Parison, an analyst at Bryan Garnier & Co. – Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Ahold , earnings , merger , Food Lion Related Stories CIMB’s results broadly within expectations Dayang back in the black in Q3 on lower one-off expenses SP Setia to see stronger earnings ahead ArcelorMittal sees weak last quarter AmInvestment: Axiata Group results could be below expectations You May Be Interested The gig economy only a stopgap measure to our woes Nationwide takes the Express to catch up SC announces new appointments Daibochi bullish on Myanmar venture PNB unit trust funds hit 210.63 billion units as of October Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Keep close watch on hills, state urged India all out for 204, England need 405 to win Tourists now prefer lodgings with Airbnb flavour, hoteliers told Property Related advertisement Latest News A ‘Yan’ to be the best Inevitable, essential failure Reflections on Budget 2017 Briefs Too premature to make final decision on TPP, says Mustapa Most Viewed in Business Governor: Bank Negara won’t tolerate ringgit transactions in NDF market PNB unit trust funds hit 210.63 billion units as of October Too premature to make final decision on TPP, says Mustapa advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen emphasised that the Fed plans to raise interest rates, which will help banks make more money from lending. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments Stocks started the day with small gains and moved higher following Ms Yellen's testimony to Congress. Banks once again marched higher as investors cheered the latest indication that interest rates will rise from their current ultra-low levels. Retailers also rose after strong earnings from Best Buy, while food and household goods makers struggled after weak results from Wal-Mart and JM Smucker. Almost all of the S&P 500's gains since the presidential election have gone to financial stocks. They lagged the market for much of this year, but they are now trading at their highest levels since May 2008, months before the financial crisis peaked. Investors hope banks will benefit from higher interest rates, faster economic growth and lighter regulation under President-elect Donald Trump. "I wouldn't expect we're going to see the entire repeal of Dodd-Frank, but we could certainly see some changes that are positive for the financial services sector," said Kate Warne, an investment strategist for Edward Jones. The Dow Jones industrial average added 35.68 points, or 0.2%, to 18,903.82. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 10.18 points, or 0.5%, to 2,187.12. The Nasdaq composite added 39.39 points, or 0.7%, to 5,333.97. The Dow has set several records since the election, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are close to records they set a few months ago. Ms Yellen told Congress that the economy is improving and added that that if the Fed keeps waiting now and raises rates too quickly later, that increases the risk of a recession. Investors already expected the Fed to raise interest rates when it meets in mid-December, and they felt Ms Yellen's comments confirmed that higher rates are coming. Bond prices slipped. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rose to 2.29% from 2.22%. Bond yields rise when investors expect higher interest rates and inflation. Bank of America gained 33 cents, or 1.7%, to 20.08 dollars and PNC Financial Services climbed 3.09 dollars, or 2.9%, to 110.60 dollars. Greater sales of mobile phones and increased online sales helped electronics retailer Best Buy post a strong third quarter, and the company forecast a larger fourth-quarter profit than analysts had expected. Its stock climbed 5.54 dollars, or 13.7%, to 45.99 dollars and hit a six-year high. Other retailers also rose. Home Depot recovered some recent losses and added 3.60 dollars, or 2.9%, to 128.93 dollars. Amazon also gained ground as Wal-Mart struggled. It picked up 9.91 dollars, or 1.3%, to 756.40 dollars. "Instead of spending in traditional ways, consumers have decided to spend their additional dollars in technology and online shopping," Ms Warne said. Wal-Mart announced disappointing sales in its third quarter. The retailer's profit also fell as it invested more money in its stores and its online business. The stock lost 2.20 dollars, or 3.1%, to 69.19 dollars. Warehouse club operator Costco and grocery store chain Kroger both took small losses as well. Jam and jellies maker JM Smucker disclosed weak sales and its stock shed 5.10 dollars, or 3.9%, to 124.85 dollars. Tyson Foods fell 2.32 dollars, or 3.4%, to 66.70 dollars. Cisco Systems fell after its earnings forecast disappointed Wall Street. The seller of routers, switches, software and services forecast a smaller-than-expected profit for its second fiscal quarter. That cancelled out a strong first-quarter report. The stock gave up 1.52 dollars, or 4.8%, to 30.05 dollars. Oil refining company Tesoro will buy Western Refining for 37.30 dollars a share in stock, a deal the companies valued at 4.1 billion dollars. The stock closed at 30.50 dollars on Wednesday, and it jumped 7.05 dollars, or 23.1%, to 37.55 dollars. Tesoro shares rose 82 cents, or 1%, to 86.56 dollars. Higher interest rates also mean a stronger dollar. The dollar climbed to 109.89 yen from 109.15 yen. The euro fell to 1.0626 dollars from 1.0681 dollars. The ICE US dollar index continued to rise. It is at its highest level in 13 years. Oil prices gave up a small gain and turned lower. Benchmark US crude slid 15 cents to 45.42 dollars a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slipped 14 cents to 46.49 dollars a barrel in London. Energy companies lagged the market after big gains earlier this week. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose two cents to 1.34 dollars a gallon. Heating oil rose one cent to 1.45 dollars a gallon. Natural gas fell six cents, or 2.2%, to 2.70 dollars per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell seven dollars to 1,216.90 dollars an ounce and silver lost 16 cents to 16.77 dollars an ounce. Copper rose two cents to 2.49 dollars a pound. The FTSE 100 index added 0.7% and the CAC 40 in France rose 0.6%. Germany's DAX gained 0.2%. Japan's Nikkei 225 barely moved and the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong eased 0.1%. The Kospi in South Korea inched higher.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Deer hunting the old fashioned way Thursday Nov 17, 2016 at 3:28 PM Nov 17, 2016 at 3:28 PM Steve Gilliland / Outdoors Columnist Sometimes as I conjure up "OK Google" or check Fox News or the 7 day weather forecast on my smart phone, all while sitting in the Walmart parking lot, I wonder how we ever survived with phones that were only made to talk on. Then it hits me; we survived quite well, thank you very much. The other day I went to fill the deer feeder in the draw below our high-rise deer blind which we constructed three years ago. As I rounded the corner on the gravel road and the blind came into view, so did several hundred thousand dollars of excavating equipment rebuilding the terraces and forming new waterways in the fields that surround our blind. Just in case it looks as though our deer hunting could be permanently interrupted there this year, I scouted out another property on which we have deer hunting permission. In front of that property is a wheat field that’s traveled frequently by deer heading for the pond and trees on the property. I found a spot in a sharp corner of the field where it appears deer are jumping the fence and entering the small woodlot. There is no blind built there and no good spot to set up a temporary blind to overlook that corner. The best option appears to be the overhanging limbs of a cedar tree seventy yards away. As I broke into a cold sweat, wondering aloud how I would ever survive not having a blind to hunt from, it suddenly hit me; I have harvested more deer from a folding camp chair tucked beneath a cedar tree than from any other way, and again, I have survived quite well, thank you very much. For those of you new to deer hunting that don’t have a blind from which to hunt, or for those of you wanting to try hunting deer for the first time but are not sure how to proceed without a blind, let me give you some tips from my experience. Mr. Webster defines the word camouflage as "a disguise or deception; to disguise in order to conceal." Camouflage does not have to make something or someone entirely disappear, it just has to make them blend in, and it does that by breaking up their outline. Examples of that would be sitting against a tree or sitting behind or under some broken overhanging limbs. Both choices camouflage you by breaking up the outline of your body. Joyce harvested her first deer ever as she sat on a camp chair behind a log in a big thick tree row. My point is that in the absence of a blind of some description, nature will provide you everything you need if you just learn to see it. The most important element of hunting is to position yourself where there is game. So when deciding upon a deer hunting location, choose a spot near a well used deer trail, where deer enter and exit a woodlot etc. If you’re bow hunting, you want to be as close to the trail as possible, but if rifle hunting choose a spot away from the trail seventy-five to a hundred yards or so. Then pay attention to where the sun will be in relation to you. You do not want the sun shining directly on you or in your eyes when it rises or sets, making it hard to see ahead of you as it shines into your eyes or lighting you up like a Christmas tree as it shines on you. Next, look around you for anything that will conceal your form, like a broken-over or uprooted tree, a tree with large broken limbs that hang to the ground or a big cedar tree with long outstretched branches. Once you have found a natural blind, figure out how best to use it. Prune and remove limbs and branches until you can tuck yourself into whatever concealment you’ve chosen. Prune away only enough to allow you entrance and to give yourself an open shooting lane. Use your imagination and move limbs and branches around if necessary to accomplish what you need. If you are firearm hunting, find a way to support your firearm. If none exists naturally in your new natural blind, a couple 1x2’s bolted together near one end opens up into an "x" to make a cheap and dandy shooting stick to cradle your gun. Your seat can be whatever you want. If you’re young you can probably get away with sitting on a log, but my choice is a cheap folding camp chair that gives me a back to lean against. It’s not always possible, but choosing to tuck yourself in amongst the branches of a big cedar tree will often help protect you from the north and west wind also. There are still plenty of ways to conceal yourself to harvest a Kansas deer without a hunting blind or tree stand. Be creative; tree limbs stacked against a fence, a piece of camouflage fabric stretched around some fence posts, even digging yourself down into an old round hay bale at the edge of a field will all fill the bill. The end result might even be more fulfilling knowing you used what God provided to fill your freezer. Continue to Explore Kansas Outdoors!

He became naturalized as... Nov 17, 2016 — by Zach Hirsch (Plattsburgh Correspondent) , in Plattsburgh, NY Listen to this story Nov 17, 2016 — Tenzin Dorjee did everything he was supposed to do and more. He became naturalized as a U.S. citizen six years ago. He co-owns the Himalaya Restaurant in Plattsburgh, which now has a second location. Each year, he helps organize a festival that brings in musicians and artists from across the country and overseas. Tenzin Dorjee, one of the owners of the Himalaya Restaurant in Plattsburgh, was repeatedly harassed in the days after the presidential election. Photo: Zach Hirsch He’s put in hundreds of hours building the city’s cultural diversity. Lately, something else is consuming his energy: fear. Since Election Day, there has been a wave of hate directed at minority groups across the U.S. Intimidation. Harassment. Swastikas. The Southern Poverty Law Center counted over 400 such incidents in the week after the election. After being repeatedly harassed himself, Dorjee is struggling to make sense of this moment, and trying to figure out how to fight back. Dorjee grew up in Bhutan. Over the years he’s been singled out a few times in Plattsburgh, but it was just “minor stuff. They trash all my flowerpots and stuff,” he said. “This feels very different.” It was Wednesday of last week, the day after Donald Trump was elected. Dorjee was walking into Walmart when he ran into two men wearing camouflage jackets. “It was a couple of guys standing next to a couple of trucks. And that’s when they say, ‘Hey chink, get the f— out of my country. Go back to where you came from.’ And I just smiled at them.”  He sighed. “Then it happened again.” Yangchen Dorjee (left), Tenzin's wife and co-owner of the Himalaya Restaurant, sang with Tibetan musician Tamding Tsetsan at the 2015 festival. Photo: Zach Hirsch Just a few steps away, two other people used the same racial slur. “I felt very uncomfortable, unsafe,” Dorjee said, and he never made it into Walmart. “I just turned around and went back home.” Then, a couple of days later, he was out running errands when two older men in a car cut him off on purpose, he said, and flashed him the middle finger. The fact that they were elderly people broke his heart. “That was something that I wasn’t expecting.” Dorjee is culturally Tibetan, and his family came to the U.S. to escape persecution from the Chinese government. Once, he said, agents of the Chinese government caught up with them in India, and he was beaten so badly it took him three weeks to recover. He came here to get away from all that. And for the most part, the North Country has embraced the Dorjees. They’re well liked and widely respected for organizing the annual Tibetan arts and culture festival. In 2015, local artists built a permanent mandala tile mural into the side of a building downtown to honor Tibetan traditions. At the unveiling, Dorjee smiled and appeared to be overwhelmed. He told the crowd that Plattsburgh is full of honorary Tibetans. Dorjee speaking at the unveiling of the Mountain Lake Mandala. Photo provided by Mountain Lake PBS Dorjee with his family. Photo provided by Dorjee “I’ve always been asked this question of 'how many Tibetan families are there in Plattsburgh?' And I’ve always said plenty. And this goes to prove that whatever I said about my family in Plattsburgh is correct…The hearts that I have here are Tibetan,” he says in Arts in Exile, a Mountain Lake PBS documentary about the festival. Now, Dorjee is frightened for his family’s safety. On Facebook he wrote a long, emotional post, which said in part,  “As fear overtakes me for the protection of my family and myself I am now joining the group that believes in right to own firearms."  He continued, "It is a sad decision for me as I believe in compassion but as a family man and human I have faults and it has driven me to the conclusion that a weapon of destruction is my only safeguard against the hate that has been directed against the color of my skin and political beliefs.” Dorjee is a practicing Buddhist. Being peaceful is a huge part of his religion and identity. But he felt like he didn’t have any other options. He planned to buy a shotgun for the house, and get a license for a concealed carry pistol. It was a dark, low moment, Dorjee said. Then he heard from friends, and he slept on it. “I got around to thinking, and then my community members, of course they’ve been very supportive on my Facebook, and then I’ve had community members come up to me and say 'Tenzin, we are behind you all the way.' And when I look at that kind of support, then I do not feel the need to bear any kind of firearms, because that is my firearm.” Instead of guns, he’s buying a new security camera. He’s also hoping to help organize a forum about racism and xenophobia. Leaders from the city and town said they think that’s a great idea. In the meantime, people are on edge. Recently, a rumor ran around SUNY Plattsburgh about the KKK. University Police sent an email reassuring students that they’ve looked into it and there is no evidence of KKK activity in the area. On Monday, Dorjee’s car was vandalized while it was parked outside of his house. He’s not sure if it’s a racial thing, but he thinks so, since it’s never happened before in the nine years he’s lived here.  Dorjee plans to fight back with compassion.

Put these deeply discounted items near the top of your list. iStockphoto By Andrea Browne Taylor, Online Editor November 20, 2016 Deep discounts on hot-ticket items, including widescreen HDTVs, gaming consoles and smartphones, are always a big draw for shoppers who decide to venture out on Thanksgiving. With a few major retailers opening their doors as early as 3 p.m. on Turkey Day, which doorbuster deals are worth braving the crowds? SEE ALSO: 15 Things You Should Never Buy During the Holidays We asked several shopping experts -- BensBargains.com's Kristin Cook, DealNews.com's Benjamin Glaser, Offers.com's Kerry Sherin, BFAds.net's Brent Shelton and NerdWallet.com's Courtney Jespersen -- to identify this year's must-have Thanksgiving Day doorbuster deals, including some that are available online. Several of the items below will sell for 50% off the retail price. One important note about doorbusters: Availability isn’t guaranteed. Since the items are in high demand and retailers have limited quantities, you’ll need to shop strategically to snag these bargains. Take a look at some of this year’s hottest Thanksgiving doorbusters. Electronics Dell Inspiron 11 3000 Laptop, $100, available at Dell.com. You can grab this doorbuster without leaving the couch. This online exclusive is a steal at half off the regular price, Glaser says, and won’t be available for purchase until 6 p.m. ET on November 24. Before purchasing, however, it’s important to assess exactly what you’ll need this laptop to do in terms of performance. “These ultra-cheap rigs aren’t very powerful,” he notes. Be sure to do some online research, paying special attention to storage capacity and reading customer reviews and ratings. But if this Dell meets your basic web surfing needs, jump on it fast. Advertisement Fitbit Alta, $100, available at Kohl's. Holiday shoppers with a fitness junkie on their gift-giving list will want to take advantage of Kohl’s Black Friday weekend sale (stores open at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day) that includes this newest Fitbit fitness tracker, Sherin says. It’s regularly priced at $130-$150 depending on model type and can be purchased online or in-store. Sherin notes that shoppers will also be able to earn $15 in Kohl’s Cash for every $50 spent. That would amount to $30 in Kohl’s Cash with the purchase of this fitness tracker. (Read more about secrets to shopping at Kohl’s.) Phillips 55-inch Class Smart 4K Ultra HD TV, $300, available at Walmart. Cook notes that deals on 4K TVs -- the next big wave in high-definition televisions -- are strong this holiday season. Early bird shoppers on the hunt for a new TV can purchase this Phillips set, which is regularly priced at $500, for 40% off online or in-store starting at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. It’s one of several big-screen TV available at Walmart during its holiday weekend sale. This TV comes with built-in WiFi, as well as several streaming apps including Netflix, YouTube, Pandora and Vudu. (Check out more Black Friday deals at Walmart.) Toshiba 49-inch 4K UHD Google Cast Smart HDTV, $200, available at Best Buy. This year, the long-standing electronics retailer will open its doors at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. Eager shoppers can pick up this high-definition television for more than half-off the retail price ($450), Cook says. It comes with Chromecast built-in (which is compatible with Apple and Android mobile products) and streaming apps including Netflix and YouTube. (Learn more about the tricks to saving money at Best Buy.) Roku 2, $45, available at Kohl's. For those looking to cut the cable cord, this digital HD streaming media player will be on sale for about 35% off (regular price $70) online and in-store, Sherin says. The Roku 2 model received 4 stars (out of 5) on review site CNet.com and can be connected to your television set via WiFi or with an Ethernet cord. It’s important to note that select items from Kohl’s Black Friday weekend sale will become available online as early as November 21. Check the website starting then to avoid missing out. Advertisement Gaming Consoles PlayStation 4 Slim 500GB Uncharted 4: A Thief's End PS4 Bundle, $250, available at Kohl’s. Gaming consoles are always a hot item and usually available at their lowest prices during Black Friday weekend sales, Shelton says. One of the best doorbuster deals on video game consoles, he notes, is this Playstation 4 system (marked down from $300), which comes with a dual shock wireless controller and the Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End video game. Shoppers who purchase it will also earn $75 in Kohl’s Cash. Kitchen and Home Keurig K55 Brewer, $90, available at JCPenney. The longtime retailer (whose doors open at 3 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day) is offering some noteworthy deals on kitchen and home products this holiday shopping season, according to Jespersen. That includes this Keurig coffee maker that’s marked down nearly 50% (regular price $175) and is available online and in-store. In addition to coffee, it can brew tea, hot chocolate or iced drinks in under one minute and accommodates a 6-, 8- or 10-ounce mug. Toys TS Swagtron Hoverboard, $200, available at Toys ‘R’ Us. Hoverboards continue to top many kids’ must-have lists for the holidays, says Shelton. This version, which is regularly priced at $300, is recommended for children ages 8 and up. It’s available in-store only starting at 5 p.m. on November 24. Not surprisingly, Toys ‘R’ Us will have many other deals on hot toys, such as LEGO block sets, available online starting on November 23 at 9 p.m. ET.

(NYSE: FL) shares ahead of the company’s third-quarter results on November 18. Europe, America And SSS Figures The brokerage expects third-quarter EPS estimate of $1.10, in line with Street, on 5.1 percent same store sales (SSS) growth versus consensus’ 4.7 percent estimate. UBS sees upside to both as the company has some of the easiest compares in its coverage. But, Europe may pose some headwinds as it laps tough high-teens SSS compare in the third quarter. However, analyst Michael Binetti noted that Foot Locker can hit his 5 percent SSS global estimate even if Europe SSS is slow to flat in the third quarter from mid-single digits in the second quarter. Looking ahead, Binetti believes the footwear retailer could guide mid-single-digit SSS growth and double digit EPS growth for FY 2017 with easy compares in the first half along with visible margin opportunities. Comparison Within The Space On the valuation front, Binetti said Foot Locker shares are cheap. “FL's stock looks inexpensive with low P/E retail names outperforming recently. At 13.6x forward 4-qtr EPS, FL trades just 1-2 P/E pts above Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) & Macy's Inc (NYSE: M) — which have ongoing negative SSS,” Binetti wrote in a note. Share Movement With respect to share movement, there could be only limited upside given its recent 17 percent outperformance versus S&P 500 since the second-quarter report. At last check, shares of Foot Locker rose 1.85 percent to $71.01, while Binetti has a price target of $76.

Hong, File). FILE - In this May 9, 2013, file photo, a worker pushes shopping carts in front of a Wal-Mart store in La Habra, Calif. Wal-Mart reports financial results Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016. By ANNE D'INNOCENZIO AP Retail Writer NEW YORK (AP) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. saw its third-quarter profit fall more than 8 percent, dragged down as it continues to plow money into e-commerce and improving its stores. While online sales improved, overall revenue fell short of expectations as the company said it was hurt in part by falling food prices. Profit at the world's largest retailer still beat Wall Street expectations, and it lifted the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast. Investors focused on the sales, though, sending shares in the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer down nearly 4 percent. Wal-Mart, like other traditional retailers, has been trying to improve its online operations and be more nimble to compete with Amazon.com and others. It spent more than $3 billion for Jet.com, a deal that closed in September and is aimed at helping it attract younger and more affluent customers. The company had also said it planned to slow its new store openings and pour money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels. "We are pleased that we can see real progress stemming from our strategic choices," CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. But he added, "We will continue to change and pick up speed to reach our longer-term aspirations." Global e-commerce sales grew 20.6 percent in the quarter, up from 11.8 percent in the prior period. Wal-Mart said it's setting up teams to accelerate the integration between Wal-Mart and Jet.com and working to use its scale in areas like shipping and sharing its product selection. The company is increasing the number of products for online orders by 50 percent for the holiday kickoff next week compared to the number available a year ago. It's also adding staff to handle customers picking up online orders at the stores, and designating a manager for that area. Wal-Mart this year also raised its stake in JD.com, China's No. 2 e-commerce site, after earlier buying an initial stake the company in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of its Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian. "We're moving quickly with e-commerce innovations and taking a fresh approach to how we think about growth," Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said in a pre-recorded conference call. The company has launched a number of changes designed to make its stores cleaner and its customer service friendlier and faster. And it's melding its online and store businesses so shoppers can jump back and forth. It's making sure its vegetables are fresh, sharpening its prices and pressing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. For the three-month period ended Oct. 31, Wal-Mart earned $3.03 billion, or 98 cents per share. That compares with $3.3 billion, or $1.03 per share, a year earlier. Analysts expected 96 cents per share, according to analysts at FactSet. Revenue rose just 0.7 percent to $118.18 billion. Analysts expected $118.6 billion. Revenue at stores open at least a year rose 1.2 percent, shy of analysts' estimates and slower than the 1.6 percent pace from the prior quarter. Traffic rose just 0.7 percent, also slower than the previous quarter. Still, it marked the ninth straight quarter of gains for a key sales measure and the eighth quarterly gain for traffic. Wal-Mart said it's lifting the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast to a range of $4.20 per share to $4.35 per share. It expects revenue at stores open at least a year to rise 1 percent to 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, which includes the critical holiday sales. For the holiday season, Wal-Mart is hammering its low-price message while working to improve store service. It's deployed holiday helpers at the checkout lines to assist shoppers in finding the shortest lines and will run to the shelves to grab products if customers forgot an item. Still, the company has plenty of challenges. Rival Target is also strongly emphasizing value - 60 percent of Target's messages this holiday season will be on that topic, up about 20 percent from a year ago. It also is pushing its stylish merchandise from home decor to clothing. Greg Foran, CEO of Wal-Mart's U.S. business, said during a conference call that he hasn't seen that the contentious presidential election has changed shoppers' behavior. "It's only been a week. I don't have a lot of data," Foran said. "For the last three quarters, I haven't seen any noticeable change." He said Wal-Mart's focused on having a good holiday season.

(Jae C. Hong / Associated Press) THURSDAY, NOV. 17, 2016, 11:08 A.M. Wal-Mart’s profit falls but beats estimates; revenue misses By Anne D’Innocenzio Associated Press Twitter Facebook Email Reddit NEW YORK – Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reported its third-quarter profit fell 8.2 percent, dragged down by investments in e-commerce and its stores. Its earnings still beat Wall Street estimates. But its revenue fell short of expectations. Wal-Mart is reinventing itself to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com and other rivals. Wal-Mart has been launching a number of changes online and in the store, from making sure its vegetables are fresh to being sharper on prices. It’s melding online services with the stores, and it’s pressing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. The company told investors in October that it was planning to slow its new store openings and pour money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels. In September, it completed its deal to buy fast-growing Jet.com for $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock in an acquisition aimed at helping the retailer attract younger and more affluent customers to drive online sales. “We are pleased that we can see real progress stemming from our strategic choices,” said Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores in a statement But he added, “We will continue to change and pick up speed to reach our longer-term aspirations.” For the holiday shopping season, Wal-Mart is hammering its low-price message while aiming to improve service in the stores. It’s deploying holiday helpers near the checkout lines at its stores. They’ll be helping customers find the shortest line and will run to the shelves to grab products if customers forgot an item. The company is also stepping up its efforts to cater to online shoppers. It’s increasing the number of products for online orders by 50 percent for the holiday kickoff compared to a year ago. Still, the company has plenty of challenges. The retailer says it earned $3.03 billion, or 98 cents per share, for the three-month period ended Oct. 31. That compares with $3.3 billion, or $1.03 per share in the year-ago period. Analysts expected 96 cents per share, according to analysts at FactSet. But revenue rose just 0.7 percent to $118.18 billion. Analysts expected $118.6 billion. Revenue at stores opened at least a year rose 1.2 percent, shy of analysts’ estimates and slower than the 1.6 percent pace from the prior quarter. Traffic was up just 0.7 percent, slower than the prior quarter. Still, it marked the ninth straight quarter of gains for a key sales measure and the eighth quarterly gain for traffic. More notably, e-commerce sales accelerated to 20.6 percent, from 11.8 percent in the prior quarter. The company said that it’s increasing its bottom end of its full-year profit forecast to a new range of $4.20 per share to $4.35 per share It expects that revenue at stores opened at least a year to rise 1 percent to 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter.

Shoppers wait to enter the Aeropostale store November 26, 2010 during “Midnight Madness” at the Tyson’s Corner Center in Tyson’s Corner, Virginia. The event is part of Black Friday, traditionally the busiest shopping day of the year and kicks off the holiday shopping season for retailers. Tyson’s Corner Center is the largest shopping center in the Washington, DC area.

While online sales improved, overall revenue fell short of expectations as the company said it was hurt in part by falling food prices. Profit at the world’s largest retailer still beat Wall Street expectations, and it lifted the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast. Investors focused on the sales, though, sending shares in the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer down nearly 4 percent. Wal-Mart, like other traditional retailers, has been trying to improve its online operations and be more nimble to compete with Amazon.com and others. It spent more than $3 billion for Jet.com, a deal that closed in September and is aimed at helping it attract younger and more affluent customers. The company had also said it planned to slow its new store openings and pour money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels. “We are pleased that we can see real progress stemming from our strategic choices,” CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. But he added, “We will continue to change and pick up speed to reach our longer-term aspirations.” Global e-commerce sales grew 20.6 percent in the quarter, up from 11.8 percent in the prior period. Wal-Mart said it’s setting up teams to accelerate the integration between Wal-Mart and Jet.com and working to use its scale in areas like shipping and sharing its product selection. The company is increasing the number of products for online orders by 50 percent for the holiday kickoff next week compared to the number available a year ago. It’s also adding staff to handle customers picking up online orders at the stores, and designating a manager for that area. Wal-Mart this year also raised its stake in JD.com, China’s No. 2 e-commerce site, after earlier buying an initial stake the company in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of its Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian. “We’re moving quickly with e-commerce innovations and taking a fresh approach to how we think about growth,” Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said in a pre-recorded conference call. The company has launched a number of changes designed to make its stores cleaner and its customer service friendlier and faster. And it’s melding its online and store businesses so shoppers can jump back and forth. It’s making sure its vegetables are fresh, sharpening its prices and pressing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. For the three-month period ended Oct. 31, Wal-Mart earned $3.03 billion, or 98 cents per share. That compares with $3.3 billion, or $1.03 per share, a year earlier. Analysts expected 96 cents per share, according to analysts at FactSet. Revenue rose just 0.7 percent to $118.18 billion. Analysts expected $118.6 billion. Revenue at stores open at least a year rose 1.2 percent, shy of analysts’ estimates and slower than the 1.6 percent pace from the prior quarter. Traffic rose just 0.7 percent, also slower than the previous quarter. Still, it marked the ninth straight quarter of gains for a key sales measure and the eighth quarterly gain for traffic. Wal-Mart said it’s lifting the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast to a range of $4.20 per share to $4.35 per share. It expects revenue at stores open at least a year to rise 1 percent to 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, which includes the critical holiday sales. For the holiday season, Wal-Mart is hammering its low-price message while working to improve store service. It’s deployed holiday helpers at the checkout lines to assist shoppers in finding the shortest lines and will run to the shelves to grab products if customers forgot an item. Still, the company has plenty of challenges. Rival Target is also strongly emphasizing value — 60 percent of Target’s messages this holiday season will be on that topic, up about 20 percent from a year ago. It also is pushing its stylish merchandise from home decor to clothing. Greg Foran, CEO of Wal-Mart’s U.S. business, said during a conference call that he hasn’t seen that the contentious presidential election has changed shoppers’ behavior. “It’s only been a week. I don’t have a lot of data,” Foran said. “For the last three quarters, I haven’t seen any noticeable change.” He said Wal-Mart’s focused on having a good holiday season. Wal-Mart shares fell $3.01, or 4.2 percent, to $68.38 in Thursday trading. To sign up for free CityBusiness Daily Updates, click here.

(NYSE: WMT) shares are trading lower by $2.80 at $68.59 in Thursday's session. Despite a Q3 EPS beat of $0.02, the Street is focusing on its revenue shortfall of $0.5 billion against analyst estimates. The company increased the lower end of the range compared to previous full year guidance to $4.20-$4.35 vs. estimates of $4.34. After a lower open, it had a brief pop but found sellers way ahead of the lower-end of Wednesday's range ($71.33), only reaching $69.52. From that level, it continued its downward descent, so far falling to $68.26. That low comes in above its October 21 low ($67.99) and just below its October 24 low ($67.99). Interestingly, in his latest 13-F filing, Warren Buffett reduced his stake in the retailer by 27 million shares. Posted-In: Technicals Intraday Update Movers Trading Ideas © 2016 Benzinga.com.

The company, which brings in about $25 million in annual revenue, serves clients such as Wal-mart and Big Lots. The hackers, based in Germany, got into the company's database, stealing all of its customer information. Hiring a data-recovery firm to undo the damage cost $5 million. Fortunately, the company's owners, who do business internationally, understood the risks of hacking. They had bought cyberinsurance with a reputable company for $2,500 per year. Once they met their $10,000 deductible, the insurance company picked up the cost of the hacking, which included business interruption and digital media liability. This tale is a rarity. Typically, only a small percentage of small and midsized businesses buy cyberinsurance. Even tech firms, who should be aware of the risks, often take a pass. Instead, most firms will buy a general-liability policy that does not protect them in a situation like this. That's a big mistake. The Global Entrepreneurship Index, released this week in connection with Global Entrepreneurship Week, found there is a strong correlation between a country's ranking on the list and its digital evolution. A big threat to the growth of digitally enabled businesses is cyberattacks. More from The Global Entrepreneurial Revolution: Entrepreneurs in wartorn Syria Entrepreneurship is at all-time high in India The secret to job growth and prosperity Many entrepreneurs give little thought to hackers when they expand internationally, because they think their companies are too small to interest cybercriminals, but they are actually very vulnerable. Attacks targeting businesses with fewer than 250 employees have been on the upswing the past five years, and in 2015, 43 percent of all cyberattacks targeted small business, according to Symantec's 2016 Internet Security Threat Report, released earlier this year. That number rose from 18 percent in 2011. It's not just companies' customer information that is at risk. Their intellectual property can be stolen, too — devastating the potential valuation of a start-up. That is not to mention the reputational damage that can occur. I don't know of any way companies can protect themselves from cyberattacks 100 percent of the time, but by insuring themselves against a breach, start-ups stand a good chance of recovering if the worst happens. Covering the risk So what types of policies do start-ups need to protect themselves? Most often, it's cyber liability coverage. For a small business that conducts e-commerce and collects credit card information, a cyber liability policy will cost about $250 a year for $1 million worth of coverage. Often, that is plenty of coverage for a small mom-and-pop business or very small start-up. A more substantial sized, fast-growing start-up will need more coverage. If you buy a policy, make sure the fine print does not exclude coverage you may need, such as attorney's costs in case you get sued by customers whose information was stolen in a data breach. Not every policy covers this, and you don't want to find out that yours doesn't when it's too late. Certain types of businesses, such as social networks, aren't covered by general policies, so you may have to buy a policy targeted to your industry. Make sure your policy covers you if you do business internationally, as well. Digital technologies have made it easy to conduct transactions across borders, even in a one- or two-person start-up. If you do international transactions on an occasional basis, it's important to get a policy that covers them. Otherwise, you could end up footing the bill for a breach by hackers thousands of miles away — a scenario most start-ups can't afford. — By Sam Meenasian, director of operations at USA Business Insurance in Burbank, California SHOW COMMENTS Please add a username to view or add comments Public Username for Commenting JOIN THE DISCUSSION To learn more about how we use your information, please read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File) (Jae C. Hong) Print Email Bloomberg News By Bloomberg News The Times-Picayune on November 17, 2016 at 9:16 AM comments Wal-Mart Stores topped third-quarter earnings estimates and boosted its annual forecast, a sign the world's largest retailer is benefiting from its push to expand e-commerce and improve its stores. Profit was 98 cents a share in the third quarter, which ended Oct. 31, the company said in a statement Thursday. Analysts estimated about 96 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Customer traffic and a surge in online sales helped fuel the results, which bode well for the all-important holiday season. Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon has been pushing to lower Wal-Mart's prices, clean up stores and take better care of customers. The company also acquired web startup Jet.com for about $3 billion in September, giving a jolt to an e-commerce division that had begun to flag. "We are going into the holidays in a really good position from a momentum standpoint," Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said in an interview. Wal-Mart shares climbed 16 percent this year through Wednesday's close, lifted by its improving performance. That outpaced the 6.5 percent gain of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. Since taking the helm in 2014, McMillon has boosted pay for U.S. workers, tried to improve Wal-Mart's grocery offering and spent billions on its online operations -- aiming to gain ground on Amazon.com Inc. Sales at U.S. stores open more than 12 months rose 1.2 percent in the quarter, just shy of the 1.3 percent predicted by analysts. Total revenue increased 0.7 percent to $118.2 billion. Overseas, the strong dollar weighed on sales, turning a 2.4 percent increase at its international unit into a 4.8 percent decline. Wal-Mart also raised the lower end of its forecast of the year. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company now expects annual earnings of $4.20 to $4.35 a share, excluding some items. It had previously set the bottom of the range at $4.15. Wal-Mart's online business increased 21 percent last quarter, an acceleration from the 12 percent gain in the second quarter. E-commerce sales growth had been slowing, and Wal-Mart has been trying to shore up the business. The Jet.com deal gave Wal-Mart access to the startup's technology and management, as well as contributing more than a month worth of its sales to the retailer's third quarter. "E-commerce was a highlight," Biggs said. "We expect to continue seeing that momentum." -- (c) 2016, Bloomberg. Shannon Pettypiece wrote this story.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.8 percent to 18,011.79 as the yen hit a six-month low, helping shares of the country's big exporters. South Korea's Kospi shed 0.4 percent to 1,972.64 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.3 percent to 22,318.47. The Shanghai Composite slipped 0.1 percent to 3,206.64 while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 crept up 0.2 percent to 5,347.30. Benchmarks in Taiwan and Indonesia fell while Singapore's rose. RATE HORIZON: In remarks to Congress, Yellen suggested the U.S. central bank is on track to raise interest rates when policymakers hold their final meeting of the year in December. She said the improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising rates, in comments that increased certainty for investors. The Fed raised its key interest rate in December 2015 but it's still at ultralow levels that have fueled a multiyear global stock market boom. Economists forecast rates will go up by a quarter-point in December followed by two more hikes in 2017. MARKET INSIGHT: "The greatest uncertainties, namely the election and the Fed rate hike, were significantly reduced over the last two weeks, which gave the market a good reason to refocus on the fundamentals of economic and corporate earnings," said Margaret Yang, an analyst at CMC Markets. CURRENCIES: The greenback rallied on the prospect of U.S. higher interest rates. The dollar climbed to 110.60 yen - its highest since the end of May - from 110.17 yen in late trading Thursday. The euro fell to its lowest in nearly a year, sinking to $1.0597 from $1.0614. WALL STREET: The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.2 percent to 18,903.82. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.5 percent to 2,187.12. The Nasdaq composite added 0.7 percent to 5,333.97. ENERGY: Oil extended its decline. Benchmark U.S. crude futures slid 54 cents to $44.88 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 15 cents to settle at $45.42 a barrel on Thursday. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slipped 43 cents to $46.69 a barrel in London. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

"We are pleased that we can see real progress stemming from our strategic choices and we appreciate the great work by our associates. Yet, we are not satisfied. We will continue to change and pick up speed to reach our longer term aspirations. We're positioned well for this important fourth quarter and wish everyone a happy, peaceful and prosperous holiday season," said Doug McMillon, President and CEO, Wal-Mart Stores.

Wal-Mart reports financial results Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File) Anne D'Innocenzio, The Associated Press Published Thursday, November 17, 2016 9:41AM EST Last Updated Thursday, November 17, 2016 11:17AM EST NEW YORK -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. saw its third-quarter profit fall more than 8 per cent, dragged down as it continues to plow money into e-commerce and improving its stores. While online sales improved, overall revenue fell short of expectations as the company said it was hurt in part by falling food prices. Profit at the world's largest retailer still beat Wall Street expectations, and it lifted the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast. Investors focused on the sales, though, sending shares in the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer down nearly 4 per cent. Wal-Mart, like other traditional retailers, has been trying to improve its online operations and be more nimble to compete with Amazon.com and others. It spent more than $3 billion for Jet.com, a deal that closed in September and is aimed at helping it attract younger and more affluent customers. The company had also said it planned to slow its new store openings and pour money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels. "We are pleased that we can see real progress stemming from our strategic choices," CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. But he added, "We will continue to change and pick up speed to reach our longer-term aspirations." Global e-commerce sales grew 20.6 per cent in the quarter, up from 11.8 per cent in the prior period. Wal-Mart said it's setting up teams to accelerate the integration between Wal-Mart and Jet.com and working to use its scale in areas like shipping and sharing its product selection. The company is increasing the number of products for online orders by 50 per cent for the holiday kickoff next week compared to the number available a year ago. It's also adding staff to handle customers picking up online orders at the stores, and designating a manager for that area. Wal-Mart this year also raised its stake in JD.com, China's No. 2 e-commerce site, after earlier buying an initial stake the company in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of its Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian. "We're moving quickly with e-commerce innovations and taking a fresh approach to how we think about growth," Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said in a pre-recorded conference call. The company has launched a number of changes designed to make its stores cleaner and its customer service friendlier and faster. And it's melding its online and store businesses so shoppers can jump back and forth. It's making sure its vegetables are fresh, sharpening its prices and pressing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. For the three-month period ended Oct. 31, Wal-Mart earned $3.03 billion, or 98 cents per share. That compares with $3.3 billion, or $1.03 per share, a year earlier. Analysts expected 96 cents per share, according to analysts at FactSet. Revenue rose just 0.7 per cent to $118.18 billion. Analysts expected $118.6 billion. Revenue at stores open at least a year rose 1.2 per cent, shy of analysts' estimates and slower than the 1.6 per cent pace from the prior quarter. Traffic rose just 0.7 per cent, also slower than the previous quarter. Still, it marked the ninth straight quarter of gains for a key sales measure and the eighth quarterly gain for traffic. Wal-Mart said it's lifting the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast to a range of $4.20 per share to $4.35 per share. It expects revenue at stores open at least a year to rise 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, which includes the critical holiday sales. For the holiday season, Wal-Mart is hammering its low-price message while working to improve store service. It's deployed holiday helpers at the checkout lines to assist shoppers in finding the shortest lines and will run to the shelves to grab products if customers forgot an item. Still, the company has plenty of challenges. Rival Target is also strongly emphasizing value -- 60 per cent of Target's messages this holiday season will be on that topic, up about 20 per cent from a year ago. It also is pushing its stylish merchandise from home decor to clothing. Greg Foran, CEO of Wal-Mart's U.S. business, said during a conference call that he hasn't seen that the contentious presidential election has changed shoppers' behaviour. "It's only been a week. I don't have a lot of data," Foran said. "For the last three quarters, I haven't seen any noticeable change." He said Wal-Mart's focused on having a good holiday season. Wal-Mart shares fell $3.01, or 4.2 per cent, to $68.38 in Thursday trading.

Topics Navigation About Contact Contribute Opinion Book Speaking KevinMD.com All Kevin’s Take Physician Patient Policy Tech Social media Meds Conditions MedEd Video After the election: I am frustrated with how people have been expressing themselves Anonymous | Physician | November 15, 2016 I have a memory of feeling overwhelming anger and animosity as a 10 year old. I was holding my father’s spot in the checkout line at Walmart in rural Illinois as he ran to grab the paper towels he had forgotten. He quickly darted back in line into the spot that I had saved him as he knew leaving me surrounded by candy for longer than a couple of minutes would be a bad idea. The elderly white woman behind us who I had barely noticed earlier tapped me on my shoulder. Surprised at what this stranger might want, I turned back and smiled at her. She met my smile with a scowl. In between curse words she furiously yelled, “From our jobs to our spots in the grocery line you guys will stop at nothing! Go back to your country!” I was confused and hurt. I wanted to retaliate so badly, but I kept quiet and pretended to ignore her. Her anger bubbled more and more and then she struck me with her cane while yelling racist comments. My father turned back at her and protected me. He said to her, “She’s just a kid. Leave her out of it.” I was so lost. I felt like I missed something. Leave me out of what? Why was this woman so mad? Growing up in a conservative predominantly Caucasian neighborhood, incidents like this were not uncommon. I remembered back to what my mother would tell me often: “You have a right to be angry. You are right to feel upset. What you don’t have a right to do is to act blindly on your feelings.You cannot turn your anger into violent actions and not think about how it affects others.” The results of the 2016 presidential election have brought back a lot of the feelings that I had towards oppressors I have faced in rural Illinois. It’s hard not to join the millions of other Americans who feel angry and let down by the results of the election. Being a liberal first generation immigrant, I naturally disagree with many of Trump’s policies on health care, economics, and immigration. I have a lot of fear about what America’s future will look like under his presidency. I worry about what my future in medicine, as a woman, and as an immigrant will look like. What makes me even more angry are people’s actions as a result of this election. Reading about xenophobic events across the country on the Twitter feed titled “Day 1 in Trump’s America” is incredibly discouraging. It feels like we have taken ten steps back in all of the progress our country has made in embracing diversity with an open mind. I realize that many others have the same fears about America’s future. Regardless of how we feel about the election, we cannot allow our fear and our anger to be turned into violence. The hospital where I am currently rotating has been busier than ever with the consequences of the not so peaceful protests in Chicago. Trump supporters and haters are both getting ostracized by the other for their beliefs. Turning on the news nightly makes me realize that anger is turning into violence on a national level. As much as I want to show my disappointment in the man that has been elected president, I am frustrated with how people have been expressing themselves. Realizing that Trump is now in a position of power and already spreading ideology similar to the woman who attacked me with her cane when I was ten is scary. I hope no one has to face the racism and hatred that I experienced in that movement. However, these xenophobic instances make me realize that it is up to us to inspire change and react with graciousness. The violence that has been brought on by both anti- and pro-Trump protesters has gotten out of hand. Now more than ever, I think back to my mother’s words: You cannot turn your anger into violent actions and not think about how it affects others. While it is naive to think that Trump will not make major change in the country, it is important to realize that we still live in a government with checks and balances. Our democracy gives us power to help influence policy by writing to state-elected officials. I hope that utilizing this power will further our ideas rather than attending protests that can get out of hand. One of my major issues with Trump’s policies is his stance on health care. Trump plans to repeal Obamacare and implement a free market health care plan. Free market health care increases the corporate power given to large health care organizations and will almost definitely drive the cost of health care up to the average American citizen. More of the money spent on health care will be distributed to administrators and corporate professionals. This will surely discourage many patients from seeking treatment for their conditions and leave the poor uninsured because they simply can’t afford the premiums. While Obamacare has had many flaws, it has insured many previously uninsured and underinsured citizens. It has helped bridge the gap in health care disparity between the rich and poor. One of the reasons I chose to go into medicine is because I believe that health care should be a fundamental right as a human. I believe that the opportunity to live a healthy life should not be dependent on socioeconomic status. It is disheartening to think that I may not be able to treat certain patients just because of their lack of insurance. There is still much speculation on how Medicaid, Medicare, and women’s health will be affected. Though the future of health care often feels grim, it is up to us to stand up for the ideas we believe in. My biggest goal is to inspire change in the system in a positive and peaceful manner.

Please read the comment policy. NewMexicoRam I was going to stay away from Kevin’s blog for awhile because I had 2 posts deleted in recent threads about the election and possible aftermath, neither of which I thought were insulting or obscene or discriminatory. Anyway, I probably still will only bounce in occasionally for awhile to cool down, but let me make this point: Where are the articles and posts that comment on the potential improvement and excitement in our society because of the outcome of this election? Did middle America vote the way they did because they thought they are listened to and accepted, or because they are sensing being locked out of the mainstream, isolated from the advantages this country has to offer? This is NOT to negate the experiences of the posters who saw and felt the harsh realities of discrimination. Those are real and regretted. But discrimination can go the opposite direction just as well and may be hidden even easier. PW I find it interesting that while Mr. Trump has been accused of xenophobia, racism and chauvinism, he’s married to an immigrant, one of his ardent campaigners is a black neurosurgeon, and his campaign manager is a woman. NormRx And his son in law is a Jew and his daughter converted to that faith. NurseMom17 Using the phrase “a Jew” is pejorative. Not nice. neuronerd Ah yes, the classic “I have a black friend” defense. PW I think what’s more telling is a black man campaigning for someone who is supposedly racist. MsPony65 You’re not alone. I’ve had my posts – neither insulting, obscene, discriminatory, nor defamatory – deleted, and I daresay this one will be deleted as well. The potential for change is great. The vote indicates that middle America is weary of the status quo and wants to return to a Constitutional Republic. This does not negate the experience of those who feel the sting of discrimination, but rather indicates that there are those who feel these issues can be better addressed through cooperation instead of polarization. Laura J Very good article and example of how disconnected we are now as Americans. It seems what I see is fear of the unknown. People from various ethnicity tend to have little respect. We raise our children to accept all diversities. The election was historic, went by the rules but it seems people are upset and don’t care about the law in place. Why? Is it the younger generations? NewMexicoRam So now it is acceptable to have “thought police?” Actions that promote minority or disadvantaged groups isn’t enough? If the “thought police” are out to get us, then I guess white middle class males are the only acceptable targets that don’t count anymore. Jewel Markess One is free to think as one wants; however, one would expect a presidential candidate not to appoint a white supremacist into the government. neuronerd Wait where was there any mention of “thought police”? NewMexicoRam It’s implied. Read it carefully. Abbey Beagle-Terrier Well Christians are always fair game. Also the overweight. So it’s not JUST white males ; ) However, one of the reason this non-white woman voted for Trump is to stop the PC insanity. Everyone else in my neck of the woods did the same. White males have more allies than you think you do and the “intelligentsia” who believe themselves to be our moral superiors are not so large in number as they think they are. They simply live in an echo chamber and surround themselves with the like minded. Jewel Markess You seem to think that it’s only left that is against Trump. Why don’t you read RedState – it’s a very conservative site, and most people there are against Trump as well. What exactly did Trump do to change people’s mind about him? Appoint an alt-right spokesperson to a government position? neuronerd Please elaborate on these unbstantiated lies that you are referring to. Sophia 99 Series of checks and balances? Do you read what is happening right now. There is NO series of checks and balances anymore. People have every right to protest this individual and his ilk for their disrespectful behavior to get elected, the lies, the swift-boating, the innuendo, mud slinging, whoring themselves with every special interest group with an agenda or a particular hate for others, and the propaganda. The world is a very dangerous place right now, and to place someone with NO experience is foolish and dangerous.He won because of voter apathy, prevented others form voting, and smear tactics- their goes your moral, ethics, and values. Others protesting have every right to be angry, and to voice civil disobedience. Basis of our Constitution and Bill of Rights. They are fighting the Red Coats! meyati Trump did say since the election that people with pre-existing conditions will be able to get coverage. I remember Trump saying that he would respect Social Security-but that seems to be on the chopping block.. Maybe in Trump’s mind privatizing SS isn’t messing with it, maybe having pre-existing coverage at high premiums is still honoring his word. I didn’t vote for Trump- I’m scared but this acting out is scarey, and I’ve been wacked on the head by opposing protestors. I was protesting about one specific thing-as was my opponenet. In my state, we have these people-that protested Trump- then the same people later protested Hillary, and then Johnson. I can’t take them too seriously.

Posted 17 Nov 2016 20:20 Updated 18 Nov 2016 00:05 A general view shows a Wal-Mart store in Monterrey, Mexico, August 10, 2016. REUTERS/Daniel Becerril Enlarge Caption  Email More A A CHICAGO: Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Thursday reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales at established U.S. stores, hurt by declining food prices and warm weather that reduced demand for winter clothes and other seasonal items. Shares of Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, fell 4.3 percent as investors shrugged off strong online sales growth and a smaller-than-expected decline in earnings. The company also raised the low end of its fiscal-year profit forecast, in line with Target Corp and other rivals that expressed optimism ahead of the holiday shopping season. Wal-Mart said it did not expect last week's U.S. presidential election to have a significant effect on holiday spending plans. "It's way too early to speculate on anything that might happen with the president-elect," Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told Reuters. Biggs said declining prices for eggs and other important products for a food retailer remained challenging, and unseasonably warm weather hurt sales in the back half of the quarter. Wal-Mart's sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.2 percent, excluding fuel price fluctuations, in the third quarter ended on Oct. 31. That was weaker than market expectations of a 1.3 percent rise, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Comparable food sales fell 1.5 percent in the third quarter, versus a 1 percent decrease in the second quarter. U.S. store visits rose 0.7 percent, slowing from increases of 1.7 percent a year earlier and 1.2 percent in the second quarter. Net income attributable to Wal-Mart fell more than 8 percent to US$3.03 billion, or 98 cents per share, from US$3.3 billion, or US$1.03 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected 96 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 0.5 percent to US$117.2 billion. Online sales increased 20.6 percent, accelerating from the previous quarter. That business added 50 basis points to third-quarter comparable sales, its biggest contribution to date. To try to narrow the gap with online leader Amazon.com Inc and increase its dominance in retailing, Wal-Mart has invested heavily in e-commerce, acquiring startup Jet.com in August for US$3 billion. "The U.S. (e-commerce) results were stronger than those in our key international markets, driven by our marketplace offering ... as well as a contribution from Jet.com," Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said. International sales fell 4.8 percent, hurt by a strong dollar and continued weakness in the UK market, but they were up 2.4 percent on a currency-neutral basis. At Wednesday's close, Wal-Mart's shares had risen more than 16 percent since the start of the year.

Asda, part of US retail giant Walmart, reported a 7.5 per cent drop in sales the previous quarter - its worst quarterly performance on record and the latest sales fall is the ninth consecutive quarter of reported declines. Sean Clarke, former head of Walmart's China business, took over as Asda chief executive in July, said a programme of price cuts and improvements on everyday items, introduced in September, is beginning to pay off. He said: “We have lowered thousands of prices, improved hundreds of own brand products and invested in more hours for colleagues on the shop floor - so it's encouraging to see more customers shopping with us in stores and online.” Earlier in the week Asda announced it was cutting petrol and diesel prices nationwide from November 15, with unleaded petrol cut by up to three pence a litre to 110.7 pence and diesel cut by up to two pence a litre to 112.7 pence.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 8:30 PM, November 17, 2016 Updated: 4:00 AM, November 18, 2016 CHICAGO - Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Thursday reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales at established U.S. stores, citing declining food prices and warmer-than-usual temperatures that curbed demand for seasonal items. Shares of Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, fell 4.1 percent as investors shrugged off strong online sales growth and a smaller-than-expected decline in earnings. Burt Flickinger, managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resources Group, said investors should be more patient as Wal-Mart has taken the right steps to fix its business by raising workers' hourly wages, improving operations with cleaner stores and focusing on increasing e-commerce sales. "The Street is making a myopic mistake of punishing Wal-Mart's shares today over quarterly sales and profits," he said. Wal-Mart raised the low end of its fiscal-year profit forecast, in line with Target Corp and other rivals that expressed optimism ahead of the holiday shopping season. Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said declining prices for eggs and other important products for a food retailer remained challenging, and unseasonably warm weather hurt sales in the back half of the quarter. Wal-Mart's sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.2 percent, excluding fuel price fluctuations, in the third quarter ended on Oct. 31. That was weaker than market expectations of a 1.3 percent rise, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Comparable food sales fell 1.5 percent, versus a 1 percent decrease in the second quarter. U.S. store visits rose 0.7 percent, slowing from increases of 1.7 percent a year earlier and 1.2 percent in the second quarter. Net income attributable to Wal-Mart fell more than 8 percent to $3.03 billion, or 98 cents per share, from $3.3 billion, or $1.03 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected 96 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 0.5 percent to $117.2 billion. Online sales increased 20.6 percent, accelerating from the previous quarter. That business added 50 basis points to third-quarter comparable sales, its biggest contribution to date. To try to narrow the gap with online leader Amazon.com Inc and increase its dominance in retailing, Wal-Mart has invested heavily in e-commerce, acquiring startup Jet.com in August for $3 billion. "The U.S. (e-commerce) results were stronger than those in our key international markets, driven by our marketplace offering ... as well as a contribution from Jet.com," Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said. International sales fell 4.8 percent, hurt by a strong dollar and continued weakness in the UK market, but they were up 2.4 percent on a currency-neutral basis. At Wednesday's close, Wal-Mart's shares had risen more than 16 percent since the start of the year.

USA TODAY For Walmart shoppers, some Black Friday deals are starting today. (Photo: SAUL LOEB, AFP/Getty Images) Walmart (WMT) shares tumbled Thursday after the company reported its third-quarter revenue edged upward but profit slipped as the big-box retailer prepares for the crucial holiday shopping season. The company posted net income of $3 billion for the quarter ended Oct. 31, down 8.2% from a year earlier and matching S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates. Total revenue increased 0.7% to $118.2 billion. Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.2%. "We delivered another solid quarter and are pleased with the continued momentum in the business," CEO Doug McMillon said in a pre-recorded conference call, according to a transcript made available to investors and the media. Walmart shares were down 3.6% to $68.76 in afternoon trading. USA TODAY Why Walmart is spending $3B for online seller Jet.com In the increasingly critical world of online sales, Walmart posted a 20.6% increase when excluding the effects of currency rates. The company's results included its $3 billion acquisition of online retailer Jet.com for the first time. The company's international segment weighed on revenue because of the negative effects of currency rates, as the unit posted a 4.8% sales decline to $28.4 billion. Excluding currency effects, net sales in the international division would have risen 2.4% to $30.5 billion.

Its earnings still beat Wall Street estimates. Revenue fell short of expectations. Shares slipped 0.4 percent in pre-market trading. The world's largest retailer says it earned $3.03 billion, or 98 cents per share, for the three-month period ended Oct. 31. That compares with $3.3 billion, or $1.03 per share in the year-ago period. Analysts expected 96 cents per share, according to analysts at FactSet. Revenue rose just 0.7 percent to $118.18 billion. Analysts expected $118.6 billion. Revenue at stores open at least a year rose 1.2 percent. Most notably, e-commerce sales accelerated to 20.6 percent. Wal-Mart is reinventing itself in the face of increasing competition from online leader Amazon.com and other rivals.
