To help customers save this new form of currency, Walmart today announced new capabilities in the Walmart app that create a faster, easier and more convenient experience for Pharmacy and Money Services customers. Along with these expanded app features, Walmart will create a new store experience that allows customers to skip traditional service lines using “express lanes” in these areas. These new capabilities will start to roll out to Walmart customers in March and are anticipated to be available in nearly all of Walmart’s 4,700 stores by fall. “These capabilities are the latest example of how we’re bringing together all of the conveniences of Walmart – great stores, convenient pickup, easy checkout and a top-notch app – to deliver one seamless shopping experience for customers,” said Daniel Eckert, senior vice president, Walmart Services. “We’re delivering a new and better experience in areas of our business that are essential for busy families. By making them faster and easier, we’re living up to our promise – to save customers money and time.” Pharmacy Updates For years, customers have relied on Walmart to save them money on their prescriptions. These new additions will further enrich the customer experience. Easy refills: After a quick, one-time setup, customers can quickly refill prescriptions, track order status, and view pricing and pickup details – all through the Walmart app. Skip the line: Once their order has been placed, customers can use new “express lanes” for easy pickup. Completing the transaction then happens in three easy steps: Open: Open the Walmart app and tap “prescription ready for pickup.” Enter a PIN or use Touch ID to activate the camera. Scan: Scan the code displayed at the register, connecting the app. Done: Associate delivers the prescription … and it’s done: The payment is processed via Walmart Pay and an eReceipt will be sent to the app and can be viewed at any time. “What our Pharmacy business is likely most well-known for is our $4 prescription program that has saved our customers nearly $5 billion,” said Paul Beahm, senior vice president, Walmart Health and Wellness Operations. “Starting today, we’ll be known for saving them more than just money. By developing and combining the best of our app with a service that our customers depend on daily, we’re driving change that makes living better easier.” Money Services Update Walmart is removing the hassle of paperwork for the millions of customers who transfer money in a Walmart store each month. The additions to the app will also simplify the process for associates by creating more opportunities for them to serve customers. At nearly 1,200 of the company’s Money Services locations, customers will also be able to save time using an “express lane.” Remove the hassle of paperwork: Customers enter information securely in the Walmart app and head to the store. Previously, customers needed to fill out paperwork in stores; now, this work can be done from the convenience of home or on the go. Move to the front of the line: Once in store, customers can use the “express lane” to move to the front of the line. In stores where there isn’t a Money Services desk, customers can visit the Customer Service desk. Customers can complete their Money Services transaction in three simple steps: Open: Open the Walmart app and tap “money ready to send.” Enter a PIN or use Touch ID to activate the camera. Scan: Scan the code displayed at the register, connecting the app. Customers then verify their information and pay. Done: Customers are on their way. A receipt and reference number is sent to the app and can quickly be texted or emailed to the recipient. Walmart is committed to transforming its business and innovating through technology investments. This announcement follows a string of other technology-focused updates from Walmart, including the expansion of the company’s online grocery pickup service, the investment in store pickup, and the offer of free two-day shipping on millions of items without a membership fee. Customers should stay tuned for more announcements as Walmart continues to find ways for them to shop when and how they want. These new Pharmacy and Money Services capabilities are some of the most powerful additions to the Walmart app. The app was built with an emphasis on making shopping faster and easier for customers – from building a gift registry to finding where an item is located in store. The app also makes it easy for customers to shop the millions of items found on Walmart.com. About Walmart Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

The other buildings on the site at 18th Street and Broadway were demolished in 2008. Teresa Bridgewaters spoke to WDRB News on Feb. 6, 2017. Drone footage shows the site at 18th and Broadway. With Frank and Teresa Bridgewaters to the right, Mayor Greg Fischer announced the planned Walmart in 2014. The office of TMG, the Bridgewaterses' construction company LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) – On Sept. 19, 2013, Louisville Metro government cut a $1.1 million check to Newbridge Development, the family company entrusted with bringing a marquee development to a prominent corner of impoverished west Louisville. About six months later, Mayor Greg Fischer joined Newbridge’s owners, Frank and Teresa Bridgewaters, for a triumphant announcement that Walmart planned to build a $25 million supercenter on the long-vacant site at 18th Street and Broadway. The city’s no-interest, $1.1 million loan would allow Newbridge to buy a handful of additional properties to enlarge the site and close the deal with Walmart. But the world’s largest retailer never built the store, abandoning the project altogether last October. Now, more than a decade after Metro government essentially gave the property to the Bridgewaterses, the site continues to languish with weeds and rubble, and city officials face the prospect of losing any influence over its future. Despite the fact that nothing has been built there, the Bridgewaterses ran up a $1.7 million debt against the land, according to a bank that is trying to foreclose on the property. Separately, the Bridgewaterses haven’t repaid the $1.1 million in taxpayer funds that Fischer’s administration lent them, on loose terms, in 2013 just before the Walmart deal was announced. In fact, city officials aren’t sure what happened to most of that money -- $743,000 – as public records show the Bridgewaterses spent only $357,000 on property purchases needed to complete the Walmart site. The dispute is likely to play out in court in the coming months as MainSource Bank pursues foreclosure on the roughly 18-acre site that the Bridgewaterses once hoped to sell to Walmart. The bank has asked the court to sell the property at a public auction to repay a $1.7 million line of credit on which the Bridgewaterses defaulted, according to the complaint. Records also show that Fischer’s administration took few steps to ensure repayment of the $1.1 million no-interest loan, which is separate from the $1.7 million bank debt. The city’s collateral on the loan amounts to a set of mortgages – worth only $357,000 – on the four properties Newbridge bought with the funds. But the Bridgewaterses also mortgaged those properties to MainSource Bank to help secure the $1.7 million credit line, records show. Metro government said it hasn’t written off the $1.1 million. Nor have officials conceded that the main site at 1800 W. Broadway -- which was donated to the city in 2002 -- will end up being auctioned by the court. “Louisville Metro will explore every option to recover any money that it is owed,” said Josh Abner of the Jefferson County Attorney’s Office, which represents Metro government in the foreclosure case. Abner said the county attorney’s office is “evaluating and preparing initial claims” to be filed in the case. The Bridgewaterses, for their part, did not respond to calls and emails from WDRB News. Last week, Frank Bridgewaters refused to speak with a reporter who visited the couple’s office in Shively. “I don’t need to talk you guys. See you later,” he said, before leaving the company’s lobby. The couple has not yet responded in court to MainSource’s foreclosure complaint, which was filed Feb. 7. Last month, a day before the foreclosure was filed, Teresa Bridgewaters told WDRB that the developers were moving forward with plans to bring a mixed-use development with retail, restaurants and possibly residences to the corner. Site remains vacant 17 years after plant closed With its position facing Broadway, the site has long been seen as a prime candidate for a big grocer or national retailer in west Louisville. “We always had a vision that we would bring this property back to a vibrant location where people could work but also enjoy the convenience of shopping,” Teresa Bridgewaters said during the Walmart announcement in 2014. But following Walmart’s retreat in October, the property remains vacant nearly 17 years after Philip Morris USA shut down the cigarette factory it had operated at 18th and Broadway for half a century. Philip Morris, in a gesture of corporate goodwill, gave the site to the city for a nominal $100 in 2002. The Bridgewaterses did not get involved until 2006, when then-Mayor Jerry Abramson's administration selected them to develop the site under an agreement with the city. The couple owns The Mardrian Group, Inc. – or TMG – a local commercial construction and land development company founded in 1992, according to its website. “I think Teresa and Frank Bridgewaters are true assets to our community,” said Metro Council member Barbara Sexton Smith, whose district includes the Broadway site. “They have spent many years trying to develop different parcels of land in our community, and they fought long and hard to bring the $30 million Walmart project here.” Under the 2006 agreement, the Bridgewaterses paid nothing for the property but were required to demolish the Philip Morris buildings and market the site to major retailers. A decade later, the city still has a tenuous claim to the property. The county attorney's office noted that the agreement gives Metro the option of buying the undeveloped land back from Newbridge, and the developers would be obligated to get rid of liens like the $1.7 million mortgage to MainSource Bank. But the city still would have pay Newbridge at least $1.7 million for the property, according to the agreement. Developers haven’t repaid $1.1 million taxpayer loan During the press conference in 2014, Fischer said the city had agreed to help seal the deal with Walmart by committing $1.8 million to allow the Bridgewaterses to buy six additional pieces of land to bulk up the site for the big-box retailer. At the time of the announcement, Metro government had already cut the $1.1 million check to Newbridge, the Bridgewaterses' company. The rest of the $1.8 million was never released as it was contingent on Walmart closing the sale. WDRB first raised questions about the loan in 2014, noting that the amount of money pledged to the Bridgewaterses seemed to far exceed what was required to buy the additional property: SUNDAY EDITION | Developers could pocket city funds under Walmart deal Records now show Newbridge ended up spending only $357,000 in property purchases between December 2013 and July 2014. Fischer spokesman Chris Poynter confirmed last week that none of the money, including the $743,000 not needed for land acquisition, has been repaid. Janet Kelly, an expert in local government finances at the University of Louisville, questioned the structure of the loan. While there are no hard-and-fast rules, Kelly said local governments typically try to ensure that any taxpayer funds given to private developers are used only for their intended purpose. For example, instead of just handing over $1.1 million to the Bridgewaterses, the city could have released the funds in stages or as needed upon the closing of the property purchases, she said. “It strikes me as highly irregular for the city to release funds to the developer for the purpose of acquisition of the property prior to that developer making a good faith evidence that the property has been purchased or is well intended (to be purchased),” said Kelly, who directs U of L’s Urban Studies Institute. “… That just doesn’t happen.” Kelly added that city officials – in their zeal to secure a big development for a low-income, under-served area – may have overlooked such details. “I can understand why they might have stepped away from their normal protocol for these type of public(-private) partnerships -- because of their, I think, genuine desire to do something for the West End,” she said. The city, through the County Attorney’s office, now says it’s going to try to get the money back from the Bridgewaterses. But in 2014, Poynter told WDRB that the Fischer administration wouldn’t mind the Bridgewaterses keeping any excess funds as a contribution to the “holistic development.” “That’s just money for them because they have spent a lot of money there over the years clearing the land, etcetera,” Poynter said at the time. Sexton Smith, the Metro Council member whose district includes the site, said she was unaware of the details of the loan but wants more information. “If there are monies that should be paid back and they were required to be paid back in the original agreement, then we should look into that and move toward that,” she said. Metro Council member David James, whose district nearly borders the site, said he didn’t know that the city loan was far in excess of what was needed to buy properties for the project. “I don’t really have thoughts on it other than, I guess, the city would be entitled to get its money back,” he said. Records show developers still may have profited During the Walmart press conference in 2014, Teresa Bridgewaters said their company had “invested millions of dollars” in the site since 2006 even though it seemed “nothing was happening.” She did not detail those investments. But even as the Broadway site remains undeveloped – and is possibly headed to a court auction – the 10-year arrangement with the city still may have been profitable for the Bridgewaterses, according to a review of public records by WDRB. In 2010, the Bridgewaterses sold off 7 acres of the site to Brown Forman Corp. and kept the $1.14 million from the sale -- a deal that Abramson’s administration approved. Brown Forman seeded the lot and built a walking track for its corporate headquarters, which is just south of the Broadway site. Abramson, now an executive in residence at Bellarmine University, recalled that allowing the Bridgewaterses to sell acreage at the rear of the site wasn’t expected to hurt efforts to land a marquee retailer for the rest of the property. “It didn’t have any negative effect on the opportunity for development. They (Brown Forman) were a supporter, and had been a strong supporter of developing that corner, and so we went ahead with it,” Abramson said in an interview last week. So far, the Bridgewaterses’ main economic contribution to the project has been the clearing of the old Philip Morris buildings, which was estimated to cost $1.3 million, according to the 2006 development agreement with the city. But in 2009, the contractor that performed the demolition sued the Bridgewaterses for nonpayment, and court records show the case was settled for $275,000. The city, for its part, refused to release records submitted by Newbridge to certify the demolition costs, saying that information is not “final” and thus, not public record. Besides the demolition costs, records show Newbridge spent $346,000 in 2007 to buy adjacent land. It’s also unclear what funds the Bridgewaterses could have realized by salvaging materials from the demolition. “There was scrap; there was all sorts of value there in terms of metals and old brick and stuff, and we allowed them to do that, to keep those funds as sort of a running start to be successful,” Abramson said. To be sure, Teresa Bridgewaters said during the Walmart announcement “much” of the material was donated to Habitat for Humanity. Meanwhile, records suggest the $1.7 million that MainSource Bank is trying to collect by foreclosure actually dates to January 2007. That’s when Newbridge first borrowed against the property – shortly after obtaining it from the city – with a loan from Your Community Bank of New Albany, Ind. The couple had been expected to obtain financing to pay for the demolition, according to the 2006 agreement. Records show the debt was shuffled to Louisville lender Gus Goldsmith before ultimately ending up with MainSource Bank in 2015. MainSource Financial Group CEO Archie Brown did not return a call for comment. Copyright 2017 WDRB News. All rights reserved.

(iStock Photo) Print Email Beau Evans, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune By Beau Evans, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune The Times-Picayune Email the author on March 12, 2017 at 9:03 PM comments A couple of shoplifting suspects led police on a short car chase in Metairie after one of them hit a Kenner police officer in the mouth in the parking lot outside a Wal-Mart Sunday evening (March 12). The two suspects were arrested once officers stopped the fleeing vehicle, according to Kenner Police Department spokesman Lieutenant Brian McGregor. Around 7 p.m., a Kenner police officer working a detail at the Wal-Mart on Veterans Memorial Boulevard went to detain a man and a woman suspected of shoplifting from the store, McGregor said. The woman then hit the officer in the mouth, and both suspects hopped into a vehicle and fled from the parking lot. Pursued by police, the pair took a right on Veterans, a right on David Drive then a right on West Napoleon Avenue before officers managed to stop the vehicle. McGregor said the two suspects were arrested, but he did not immediately have information on what charges they may face.

Frank Ready fready@centredaily.com i By Frank Ready fready@centredaily.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Everybody has a birthday — and a large subset of that demographic also seems to enjoy cupcakes. Wal-Mart locations all over the country used the hours between noon and 4 p.m. Sunday to raise a sweet treat to all of the birthdays that will be celebrated over the course of the year. The bakery at theBenner Pike Wal-Mart prepared 600 chocolate and vanilla cupcakes. Passers-by — and there were quite a few — also had a choice between whipped or buttercream frosting. “You don’t get anything for free nowadays. You’ve got to take advantage of it,” Beth Thomas, a bakery employee, said. Typically, Thomas spends her workdays making bread or decorating doughnuts, but on Sunday, she was the intermediary between the customers and their early/belated/right-on-time birthday gifts. She said that the bakery was able to crank out all 600 cupcakes over the course of a week, a small fraction of the 3 million that were distributed by Wal-Mart locations across the nation on Sunday. “I think it just promotes a healthy relationship with our customers,” Thomas said.

Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) Mar 12, 2017 at 12:00PM It's been a tough year for brick-and-mortar retailers trying to take on the growing popularity of e-commerce. In the fourth quarter last year, e-commerce accounted for 9.5% of all retail sales in the U.S., according to the census bureau. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been a huge beneficiary of the trend. Meanwhile, brick-and-mortar retailers like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) are working to catch up to Amazon. One big exception, however, is Costco (NASDAQ:COST), which would rather see customers come into its warehouse clubs. While that worked for a little while, Costco has started falling short of revenue and earnings expectations recently. In the fourth quarter, Costco fell short of analyst expectations for same-store sales growth and profit. Costco's membership model is often seen as well protected from Amazon, but that doesn't seem to be the case any longer. Image source: Costco. Costco isn't really fighting back on e-commerce About a year ago, Costco CFO Richard Galanti said the only thing keeping him up at night is "everybody in the world never wanting to leave their house and only typing stuff to order and get it at the front door." While Costco has made some improvements to its online shopping platform, it's still holding back certain product features, like ordering online and picking up in the store. Galanti says it doesn't have room in its stores for in-store pickup anyway -- although Wal-Mart's Sam's Club was able to make it work. Costco doesn't think it's losing in e-commerce. It's currently attacking the "low-hanging fruit," as Galanti put it. And that strategy is working. Online sales increased 11% to 12% last quarter. However, online sales totaled just $4.5 billion for the quarter -- 4% of total revenue. Is a membership increase coming at the exact wrong time? Membership fees generate the vast majority of Costco's profits as it sells its actual merchandise at razor-thin margins. But in the last few quarters, membership revenue growth has decelerated to around 5.5% from around 7%. Costco hopes to reaccelerate membership revenue growth by increasing its membership fees by 9% -- from $55 to $60 for its most popular rate. It's the company's first rate increase in five years. But as more shoppers are able to get what they need online, an increase in membership fees runs the risk of reducing gross membership additions and lowering renewal rates. Sam's Club memberships can be had for less than Costco ($45). Additionally, Wal-Mart.com just introduced free two-day shipping on two million items available online -- no membership required. Amazon Prime membership costs just $99 for unlimited two-day shipping, and includes video and music streaming among other bonus features. Importantly, Amazon Prime continues to prove its worth. Its video-streaming catalog is on par with premium cable networks, and its original series and films won multiple awards this past year. Its collection of Amazon-branded exclusives is expanding, as well, taking on Costco's Kirkland brand. For consumers facing a decision between Amazon Prime and a Costco membership, Prime continues to look more attractive. Meanwhile, the price hike at Costco makes it look slightly less attractive.

This is apparent. Along with that comes the rise in discussion of a poem by pastor Martin Niemöller in response to the Nazis purging selected groups from Germany and Europe while German intellectuals remained silent. It is titled “First they came for,” for the refrain that remains consistent throughout the poem. Niemöller writes:   First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Socialist. Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Trade Unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.   When I see this in tandem with the images of desecrated cemeteries, hate speech in graffiti and crowds of people chanting “Trump, Trump, Trump” or “Build That Wall,” I am reminded of a time when the core theme of this poem revealed itself to me. It was not under the overreaching shadow of the new administration. It was when I had just entered high school, I was only 14 years old. My mom and I had gone to our local Walmart to pick up a tool box and tools for a school project. I had asked her if I could take the tools we already had at home. She told me that it would be easier if I had a set of my own, and I agreed. While in the store, we had taken the tools we picked up and put them all inside the toolbox, prior to buying them, to make sure that everything fit neatly inside of it. We had gone to the self-checkout area because the only two registers that were open had lines stretching all the way back to the garden section. As we were walking out, we were approached by two Glendora police officers. They had asked to see our bag and our receipt and had us wait on a bench outside the door while an employee checked our receipt and our bags to make sure nothing was amiss. I knew they had suspected we’d stolen something, which I understood from the store’s perspective. I thought about it while we were sitting there waiting and I assumed it had been because someone who had actually stolen something did something similar. However the real outrage began after we had been returned our bags yet not allowed to leave. The officer that had been waiting by the squad car watching us leaned in to the other after he had returned our purchases, whispered something and then approached us once again. One officer asked my mother to follow him some way away to answer some questions while the other stood with his arms crossed and watched me. I took out my phone to text my grandmother and tell her we would be home late, saying that we hit traffic and not wanting to worry her. He stepped closer. I took my phone out again when she replied. He stepped closer again. I could see a hard look of distrust and vexation on his face. I was too afraid to take my phone out again. As I sat there, I could hear some of the questions my mother was being asked. The exchange between the officer and my mother was as follows:   What is your relation to that child? That’s my daughter. Where is she from? Here? We live in San Dimas. [My hometown, less than five miles away.] How long has she lived with you? … I don’t understand. How long as she lived with you? Since I gave birth to her? That’s my daughter. Uh huh. For how long? What do you mean ‘how long’? I mean, how long. She’s not adopted. That’s my daughter. Where was she born? Here, in Glendora. What hospital? Foothill. Can you prove that? How would I do that? Do you have her birth certificate? Not on me. It’s in my safe deposit box. Why don’t you have her birth certificate? I don’t carry that around. Why not? My father had his identity stolen. We don’t want it to happen again. Uh huh. Okay, ma’am. You can have a seat.   When my mother sat back down, the other police officer took over questioning. But instead of my mother, he was questioning me.   Quien es?   He asked this while pointing to my mother. I didn’t know much Spanish, because my family didn’t speak it much around the house, but I knew enough to answer that question.   That’s my mom.   He immediately looked displeased with my answer.   Quien es?   He asked again, more forcefully, leaning in as if to suggest I say something else. I don’t know what you want me to say.   That’s my mom.   He seemed frustrated. He pulled the other officer aside and they spoke with their backs turned to us for a while. Meanwhile, a crowd of about twenty people had gathered just to stare. There were no whispers, no murmurs, just twenty sets of eyes dead set on my mother and me. It was like a nightmare where you can’t scream. One officer turned around to watch us, the other walked to the driver’s side door of the squad car and said something into the radio. The only words I could make out were: … questioning … harboring illegal alien… I heard the crackle and the grainy response on the other end. He took a moment after that to walk out with two sets of handcuffs and approach us once again. The full weight of what was about to happen didn’t hit me until the employee who had checked our bags ran out in front of him and asked him what he was doing.   Wait, wait, they didn’t steal anything! Ma’am, I’m gonna have to ask you to please wait inside the store. But they didn’t do anything. What are you gonna arrest ‘em for? Ma’am, I have to ask you again to please wait inside the store. No! They didn’t do anything! You can’t arrest them!   It wasn’t until one or two of those twenty people pulled out their phones to videotape this tiny woman shouting at these officers that the officers gruffly bid us good evening and drove away. I didn’t tell anyone that this had happened, not even my family, when I got home. I was in such shock that I sat in bed for about three hours and didn’t move, didn’t speak, I think I barely even blinked. I am mixed race, Latinx and Middle Eastern, and I am not white-passing. I am dark-skinned by typical standards. My mother, however, is significantly lighter in complexion. It is very easy to mistake me for adopted or for a stepdaughter. But I was never nearly incarcerated for it. Even when my mother and I were both telling the truth, these officers were fully prepared to arrest us while at least twenty people looked on and did nothing. They even seemed to make an effort to make me uncomfortable telling my family where I was and to keep other people from intervening. The only person willing to speak up for us was someone who didn’t have to, because the origin of the conflict was resolved, but did it anyway. She spoke up for us when no one else wanted to and the people who had the most power over the situation tried to keep her from doing it. That is the importance of the Niemöller’s poem. That is the importance of bystander intervention and acting on your words. If you, at the beginning of this new era of fear, proudly proclaimed that protest does nothing and we should all see where things go before saying anything, then know that the story you just read will keep happening. It absolutely will and it will only escalate. There is no more room to “just see what happens.” There is no more room for “giving chances.” You either do whatever you can to put an end to this new era of modern fascism or you are passive aggressively telling people in harm’s way to lie down and take it. I understand that it is scary. Doing the right thing is often scary. Sometimes it’s downright terrifying ― but it has to be done. “Never again” is happening again. It’s happening again before our very eyes, and we have to put a stop to it. Speak up for people who cannot speak up for themselves because they are being silenced. Being silenced makes it easy to hurt us. Help protect us. When you speak up for those being silenced to protect them you are speaking up for yourself so you can have protection, too.   Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) activism hate crime hate rhetoric mob mentality police racial stereotypes 2017-03-12 Madeleine Orona Burgos Share ! tweet Tagged with: activism hate crime hate rhetoric mob mentality police racial stereotypes Previous: LC project Boreen tease new album at Smith Hall Related Articles This Issue’s College Issue: Vaccinating College Students, Removing Exemptions March 10, 2017 Trump’s Address To Congress: A promise for the future or a misguided string of claims?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 March 2017 by Military News Solid Holiday Demand In The U.S. For GoPro HERO5 SAN MATEO, Calif., Nov. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — GoPro Inc. (NASDAQ: GPRO) today announced solid holiday quarter sell-thru in the U.S. for its new HERO5 cameras. Based on internal data, GoPro’s week of Black Friday camera unit sales were up more than 35% year-over-year at leading U.S. retailers.  Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday sales of camera units at GoPro.com were up approximately 33% year-over-year.  According to the NPD Group, since the launch on October 2, HERO5 Black has been the best-selling Digital Imaging device in the United States. HERO5 cameras are available at major US retailers including Amazon, Best Buy, Target and Walmart. „We have a lot of work to do to finish the quarter and our fiscal year, however our HERO5 cameras have been very well-received by critics and consumers alike,” said Nicholas Woodman, Founder & CEO of GoPro. „Both HERO5 cameras can now auto-offload new content to the cloud and our Quik mobile app makes accessing and editing your footage fun. Its clear consumers are excited about these new features.” GoPro also announced a company-wide restructuring that will reduce full-year 2017 non-GAAP operating expenses to approximately $650 million (GAAP: $735 million) and achieve its goal of returning to non-GAAP profitability in 2017. The restructuring includes the closure of its entertainment division, facilities reductions, and the elimination of more than 200 full-time positions plus the cancelation of open positions for a reduction in force of approximately 15 percent. Additionally, Tony Bates will depart his position as president of the Company at the end of the year.  „My time at GoPro has been an incredible experience,” said Tony Bates.  „In the past three years, GoPro has seen enormous progress in camera technology, software and international growth.  Today GoPro has a solid leadership team deeply focused on its core business and profitability.” GoPro estimates that it will incur total aggregate charges of approximately $24 million to $33 million for the restructuring, including approximately $13 million to $18 million of cash expenditures as a result of the workforce restructuring, substantially all of which are severance costs, and approximately $11 million to $15 million of non-cash expenditures, consisting primarily of stock-based compensation expense and accelerated depreciation associated with office consolidations. The company expects to recognize most of the restructuring charges in Q4 2016. „Consumer demand for GoPro is solid and we’ve sharply narrowed our focus to concentrate on our core business,” said Nicholas Woodman. „We are headed into 2017 with a powerful global brand, our best ever products, and a clear roadmap for restored growth and profitability in 2017.” About GoPro, Inc. (NASDAQ: GPRO) GoPro, Inc. is transforming the way people share themselves and their experiences. What began as an idea to help athletes self-document themselves engaged in sport, GoPro has become a storytelling solution that helps people capture and share themselves engaged in life.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release may contain projections or other forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements in this press release include, but are not limited to, expectations regarding product sales, the restructuring and reduction in workforce, the number of employees impacted by the reduction in workforce, the aggregate charges for employee terminations and other costs associated with the restructuring including office consolidations, the estimates of related cash expenditures by the Company in connection with the restructuring and the timing to recognize these charges. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual events or results may differ materially.  Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are the Company’s ability to implement the restructuring in various jurisdictions; possible changes in the size and components of the expected costs and charges associated with the restructuring; risks associated with the Company’s ability to achieve the benefits of the restructuring; completion of quarter-end and annual financial reporting processes and review and the risks more fully described in the Risk Factors section of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, which are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof or as of the date otherwise stated herein. GoPro disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures GoPro provides estimates of future operating expenses in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and on a non-GAAP basis. The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP operating expenses, to evaluate the core operating performance of its business, for comparison with forecasts and strategic plans and for calculating return on investment. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, nor serve as an alternative for GAAP.  Since the Company finds non-GAAP financial measures to be useful, it believes that investors benefit from seeing results reviewed by management in addition to seeing GAAP results. The Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with its GAAP financials, provide useful information to investors by facilitating: the comparability of its on-going operating results over the periods presented; the ability to identify trends in its underlying business; and the comparison of its operating results against analyst financial models and operating results of other public companies that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations of each type of adjustment that the Company incorporates into non-GAAP operating expenses and a reconciliation of estimated 2017 GAAP operating expenses to non-GAAP operating expenses are presented in the financial statement portion of the Company’s press release issued November 3, 2016 to report its financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2016.

A full-size reproduction of the Greek Parthenon Before it became "Music City," Nashville was known as the Athens of the South. In 1897 for Tennessee's Centennial Exposition, city fathers built a full-scale replica of the real Athens' most famous landmark. Originally made of plaster, wood and brick, Nashville's Parthenon wasn't meant to be permanent. But because it cost too much to demolish, Nashville decided, "What the heck, let's just rebuild it with real marble floors." So while the British Museum in London and the Greek government continue to duke it out over the Parthenon's original statues (since 1817, what's known as the Elgin Marbles, as in the Duke of Elgin who got them from the Ottomans, have been on permanent public display at the British Museum), Nashville continues to give locals and visitors the chance to gawk at a replica of one of the world pinnacles of classical architecture. It's such a perfect clone that during recent renovations, the 2,500-year-old Greek Parthenon sent an architect to Nashville's Centennial Park to snap photos of its spawn. 2. A cinnamon roll that makes international headlines In 1996, an employee at Bongo Java, a popular Nashville coffee shop, noticed, right before he was about to bite into it, that one of its signature homemade buns bore an uncanny resemblance to Mother Teresa. Before he could so much as say three "Hail Marys," the BBC, Paul Harvey and even David Letterman (Paul Shaffer wrote a song about it) made the bun famous. The real Mother Teresa got wind of the "Immaculate Confection" and even though she reportedly laughed about it, her people sent a cease and desist order. Although copyright law was probably on owner Bob Bernstein's side, the power on Mother Teresa's side convinced him and his $250-an-hour lawyer to change its name to "The Nun Bun." The renamed cinnamon roll was quickly dispatched to a glass-enclosed case in the front of the store, but in 2005, thieves broke in on Christmas, making off with the famed confection. Despite occasional sightings of the kidnapped bun, the $5,000 no-questions-asked-reward is still unclaimed. 3. An art festival that revolves around the tomato You say tomato. I say Tomato Art Fest. This costume-friendly art festival, an annual undertaking in historic East Nashville's Five Points District, has grown faster than a tomato vine on Miracle-Gro. Hatched 10 years ago as "kind of an accident" by Meg and Bret MacFadyen, owners of the Art and Invention Gallery, it has become one of Nashville's premiere hipster events. It features 2,000 square feet of floor to ceiling art interpreting the tomato. Not only are tomato royalty crowned (both a Tomato King and Queen who march in the parade behind a brass band), but there are Bloody Mary taste-offs, tomato bobbing, tomato beauty pageants and wet burrito competitions. That's where competitors eat burritos as fast as they can while being hosed down by a firetruck-like hose. "People come up with a tomato-related idea and we say, 'Does it hurt anybody? Great, let's do it,' " Bret says. Bushels of art flood in from around the world. This year's winner for Best Use of Tomato Humor was retired elementary school guidance counselor Jim Hartline, whose Roma Coliseum featured columns fashioned from real tomatoes. There are also tomato haiku competitions and a tomato song writing contest. And yes, there's a CD featuring, among other top hits, Peter Cooper's "Please Don't Throw Tomatoes at Me." 4. Songwriting doctors and insurance agents From the airport to the local Target to the 10 a.m. opening of Tootsie's Orchid Lounge on Broadway, musicians of all stripes croon their lyric-writing hearts out. At Parlor Productions on Music Row in a restored bungalow once owned by Randy Travis, even the nonmusically inclined write songs at corporate team building events put on by Ultimate Event Nashville. Companies such as American Express, Bank of America and Nissan send normally reserved execs to pen lyrics with songwriters who regularly produce songs for stars such as Brad Paisley, Faith Hill and George Strait. "It's a blast for these folks who normally wear suits," says Robin Ruddy, a performer who used to tour with Rod Stewart, who owns the Grammy-producing Parlor Studio with her husband, Larry Sheridan. "We divide them into teams, each led by a hit songwriter, and then each team writes a song, which we then record. Even if they can't sing, we get them out there singing and even line dancing." After seven years of offering this "American Idol for Suits," has Ruddy ever plucked out any potential talent? "Ah -- no, but it's a really great fun bonding experience," Ruddy says. 5. A city tour in Milk of Magnesia pink bus The Jugg Sisters -- aka Sheri Lynn Bucy and Brenda Kay Wilkins -- are the big-hair, blue eyeshadow and spandex behind the wackiest tour in Nashville. Nash Trash, their 90-minute comedy tour, rides past many of the city's country music's institutions. Tickets sell out months in advance to people hankering to get one of 32 seats on the sisters' trash-talking, dirt-dishing, yeehaw-yelling tours. Lap-size coolers of beer and wine are allowed. Needless to say, squeezy cheese hors d'oeuvres are also served. This article was originally published in 2013. Content by LendingTree Rates now at 3.2% APR (15 Yr Fixed). Do you qualify?

Sections Deseret NewsUtah Utah About Utah: Utah cowboy explains 'the top 1 percent love what we do' By Lee BensonDeseret News Published: March 12, 2017 4:00 p.m. Updated: March 13, 2017 12:20 p.m. 6 Comments 1 of 14 View 14 Items Clark Knight Danna Burns-Shaw is a fifth-generation Burns owner. PARK CITY — There ain’t much about the Burns Cowboy Shop on Main Street that screams Old West. Not when belt buckles can go for a grand, boots for three grand and hat bands for five grand. The other day a saddle went out the door for 50 grand. An unsuspecting customer walked in recently, looked around, and brought a belt to the counter. The clerk rang up the purchase: $4,995. “Wait, what?” said the customer, “I thought it was $49.95.” He had failed to notice the comma. “Happens all the time,” says Danna Burns with a sympathetic smile. Better than anyone, she knows the Burns Cowboy Shop was never intended to be for everyone. “The top 1 percent love what we do,” she explains, noting, by way of example, the current eight-month waiting list for a high-end authentic Burns custom-built saddle. “‘Largest selection, lowest price’ used to be the company slogan. That worked really well for us — until it didn’t.” • • • The truth is, all appearances aside, the Burns Cowboy Shop is about as Old West as they come — the latest chapter in a family story of resilience that would make anyone who lives by the creed “cowboy up” stand up tall in the saddle and applaud. The Burns have remained in business for 141 straight years precisely because whenever the world turns they turn with it. They have survived recessions and the Great Depression, the invention of the automobile, two world wars, the decline of the American cowboy, computerization, Y2K and Wal-Mart. Every single time it looked like they were finished, they weren’t. Let’s review the history: • In 1876, Miles Burns, whose mother crossed the plains to get to Utah, opened a harness shop in the central Utah town of Loa. • In 1898, facing a declining clientele in Loa, Miles’ son Vivian put the business on logs, moved it 50 miles north to Salina and invented saddle pack bags that were adopted by the U.S. government for use with its cavalry horses. • In 1940, with horses becoming more and more obsolete, Viv’s son Vern invented the Pik Pocket, a collapsible storage pouch that snapped onto the springs on the back of the seat of a pickup truck. • In 1962, after car and truck manufacturers covered the seat springs, Vern’s son Dan invented Indian blanket seat covers. • Which brings us to Danna Burns Shaw, Dan’s daughter, who, when faced with the recession of 2007, had the idea to move the Burns brand into what she calls the “resort arena,” creating a line of designer boots, clothing, hats, bags, accessories — even exotic leather-covered cellphone cases — all of it targeting high-end customers who are willing to spend thousands so they can look like a worn-out old cowboy. Sure, it was a gamble when Danna, her husband Scott and oldest son Braydan went the upscale route. And sure, they continued to keep their business in Salina alive, where there are still honest-to-goodness cowboys who buy their traditional, and more affordable, line of boots, saddles, bridles, buckles and harnesses. But they couldn’t have called themselves Burnses if they hadn’t gone for it. Certainly no one was willing to face Miles, Viv, Vern or Dan when they got to the other side and tell them they hadn’t. Ten years down the road, it appears the resort reinvention was yet another good idea. Park City has given the Burns family a nice new niche and identity, allowing them to open a second Burns Cowboy Shop in Carmel, California, which is also thriving. (They opened another high-end store in Newport Beach, but had to shut it down for lack of business. “Leather needs weather,” sighs Danna). 6 comments on this story “We’ve always been merchants,” says Danna, who lives in Carmel and runs the shop there, leaving day-to-day management of the Park City store to Braydan, while other members of the sixth generation operate Burns Saddlery, the manufacturing and retail complex in Salina, as well as yet another Burns Cowboy Shop in Lehi. “We represent the spirit of the West — to seek a better life,” says Danna. “We always have and hopefully always will. “The family slogan is, ‘You’re either green and growing or ripe and rotting.’ You’ve constantly got to find your green. With each generation, everybody’s had to find their own.” Like that? Read this.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE Facing pressure from environmentalists and shareholder activists, major U.S. food companies and restaurant chains are moving to limit antibiotics in farm animals raised for meat. Last month, Tyson Foods announced a "no antibiotics ever" pledge for all Tyson-branded chicken products, building on an earlier promise to restrict drug use on broiler chickens. Analysts see the latest Tyson announcement as further evidence of a trend of large companies limiting pharmaceuticals that scientists believe increases drug-resistance for treating pneumonia, infections and other illnesses in humans. The wave started in 2014 with Perdue Chicken and chicken-based fast-food chain Chick-fil-A, followed by McDonald's, Wal-Mart Stores, Pilgrim's Pride and others. The announcements vary in scope, with some companies, for example, still permitting the use of ionophores, antibiotics not used in human medicine. The shift follows warnings about antibiotic resistance from health officials and a September 2016 United Nations General Assembly resolution that pledged coordinated action to address overuse. "We're seeing a cry from consumers for meat that's responsibly raised," said Lena Brook, a food policy advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). Still, the breadth of the movement should not be overstated. While an estimated 40 to 50 percent of U.S. chicken now is antibiotic-free, the percentage is far lower for pork and beef. Moreover, several leading companies have resisted action. Kentucky Fried Chicken, part of Yum Brands, currently scores an "F" on an NRDC scorecard on antibiotics policy, while Sanderson Farms, a leading U.S. chicken producer, has lampooned the trend. "There's certainly strong and growing demand for it today, but to what extent it's a fad or a long-term trend remains to be seen," said Zain Akbari, a food industry analyst at Morningstar. Experts in animal farm science say U.S. farmers for decades routinely employed antibiotics as a means to speed growth rates for animals, and to prevent disease outbreaks on farms where animals are frequently packed in close quarters. But an April 2014 World Health Organization report warned of the potential for a "post-antibiotic era" in which "common infections and minor injuries can kill" as drugs become ineffective.

First in the 1920s, the western part of the city was the location where two large rayon plants, Bemberg and Glanzstoff,  were built by German companies. Those rayon plants turned Elizabethton into an industrial city, attracting other small industries to service them. With the coming of globalization, first Bemberg and then North American Rayon closed down operations. A large fire in the North American Rayon building in February 2000 provided the funeral pyre for the Elizabethton industries. But the western sections of the city had a lot of value. The landholdings of the two factories were developed into shopping centers and a Wal-Mart, allowing the city’s west side to continue to drive the local economy. That was then and now, but the west side of Elizabethton may be evolving into another economic driver for the future. To help make that future a reality, Elizabethton is preparing to implement the city’s first use of a tax increment financing district. It is hoped that the TIF would provide financing for potential development of a 330-acre area of the West Elk Avenue section, including the Watauga riverfront in that area. The area roughly extends from Sycamore Shoals State Historic Park to Cherokee Industrial Park and from West Elk Avenue to the Watauga River. Jon Hartman, the city’s director of planning and economic development, has led the effort. He led the effort to get the engineering firm of Parsons-Brinkerhoff to provide recommendations after a detailed study of the region. In an interview on Feb. 10, Hartman said the hope is to roll out the TIF project this fall. He said there are a lot of players needed to make it happen. Those include the Elizabethton City Council, the Carter County Commission and state officials. Another player could be the Elizabethton Housing and Development Agency or the Elizabethton Industrial Development Board. A big part of Hartman’s work on creating Elizabethton’s first TIF has been to explain it to citizens. At meetings and presentations, Hartman has explained that TIFs are an incentive tool the state allows local governments to use to encourage new development. Hartman explains to citizens that when a TIF district is created, Elizabethton and Carter County will continue to receive the same amount of revenue on properties in the district. When property in the district is developed, the city and county don’t receive the taxes at the higher property value. The revenue generated above the original property value is set aside to help pay for improvements within the TIF district. After the period for the TIF has expired and the district no longer exists, all tax revenues go directly to the city and the county for general operations. Hartman said the city’s first TIF could provide Elizabethton with new development and redevelopment of what was once industrial property. For an area that has seen the rise and fall of two major rayon plants on the land, planners hope the public “ain’t seen nothing yet.” Recommended for You Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Antibiotic-Free Premium Experts in animal farm science say U.S. farmers for decades routinely employed antibiotics as a means to speed growth rates for animals, and to prevent disease outbreaks on farms where animals are frequently packed in close quarters. But an April 2014 World Health Organization report warned of the potential for a "post-antibiotic era" in which "common infections and minor injuries can kill" as drugs become ineffective. In voluntary guidelines that took effect in January, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said antibiotics in agriculture should be limited to medically necessary uses and not for weight gain. The call by public officials has dovetailed with heightened consciousness about food in broader American society that has also propelled organic food. Instead of antibiotics, Tyson is turning to probiotics and to botanicals such as oregano and thyme for routine treatment, while still employing antibiotics if birds become sick, a spokesman said. 1|2|Next Page>> PREVIOUS ARTICLE One step closer: California gives green light to self-driving car tests NEXT ARTICLE Now that the US is out, Beijing authorities may be interested in attending TPP talks Facebook Twitter Google+ Write a Comment Terms Enter your comments - 3000 characters max Type in image code  Receive our promos  Respond to this email Submit MOST POPULAR OF THIS SECTION 1 Starbucks price hikes brew up storm 2 McDonald's Taiwan in final stage of transfer to local owner: report 3 Now that the US is out, Beijing authorities may be interested in attending TPP talks 4 Why can't young people stay in a job? 5 New highs for US stocks; Dow win streak longest since 1987 6 Invest in Taiwan, President Tsai urges Taiwanese businesses in N.

Last month, Tyson Foods announced  a “no antibiotics ever” pledge for all Tyson-branded chicken products, building on an earlier promise to restrict drug use on broiler chickens. Analysts see the latest Tyson announcement as further evidence of a trend of large companies limiting pharmaceuticals that scientists believe increases drug-resistance for treating pneumonia, infections and other illnesses in humans. The wave started in 2014 with Perdue Chicken and chicken-based fast-food chain Chick-fil-A, followed by McDonald’s, Wal-Mart Stores, Pilgrim’s Pride and others. The announcements vary in scope, with some companies, for example, still permitting use of ionophores, antibiotics not used in human medicine. The shift follows warnings about antibiotic resistance from health officials and a September 2016 United Nations General Assembly resolution that pledged coordinated action to address overuse. “We’re seeing a cry from consumers for meat that’s responsibly raised,” said Lena Brook, a food policy advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). Still, the breadth of the movement should not be overstated. While an estimated 40 to 50 percent of US chicken now is antibiotic-free, the percentage is far lower for pork and beef. Moreover, several leading companies have resisted action. Kentucky Fried Chicken, part of Yum Brands, currently scores an “F” on an NRDC scorecard on antibiotics policy, while Sanderson Farms, a leading US chicken producer, has lampooned the trend. “There’s certainly strong and growing demand for it today, but to what extent it’s a fad or a long-term trend remains to be seen,” said Zain Akbari, a food industry analyst at Morningstar. Ostrich farming: New scheme to supply quality meat Experts in animal farm science say US farmers for decades routinely employed antibiotics as a means to speed growth rates for animals, and to prevent disease outbreaks on farms where animals are frequently packed in close quarters. But an April 2014 World Health Organization report warned of the potential for a “post-antibiotic era” in which “common infections and minor injuries can kill” as drugs become ineffective. In voluntary guidelines that took effect in January, the US Food and Drug Administration said antibiotics in agriculture should be limited to medically necessary uses and not for weight gain. The call by public officials has dovetailed with heightened consciousness about food in broader American society that has also propelled organic food. Instead of antibiotics, Tyson is turning to probiotics and to botanicals such as oregano and thyme for routine treatment, while still employing antibiotics if birds become sick, a spokesman said. Tyson, which has faced shareholder resolutions in recent years on its water policy and other sustainability issues, also plans to limit antibiotics in pork, beef and turkey, although it has not yet set target dates. Fake stamps: Butcher arrested for selling unhygienic meat “We’re eliminating human antibiotics because it’s the most responsible approach to balance a global health concern and animal well-being,” a Tyson spokesman told AFP. “Antibiotics resistance is a very complex issue with no single cause and no single solution. It’s a global concern and we want to be part of the solution.” As other companies have done, Tyson began with chicken, in part because chicken farms tend to be vertically organized within companies, compared with pork and beef, which involve contracts with outside farmers. That means the company would need to institute programs that impact its suppliers, analysts say. Advocates of stricter antibiotic use are pressing for action on beef and pork too, and are preparing a shareholder resolution for McDonald’s annual meeting. Since beef already has more premium grades, adding antibiotic-free products could be another opportunity to introduce a pricier product, said Akbari, the Morningstar analyst. Akbari said much of the current push is in response to millennials, who increasingly will “force retailers and producers to be pretty nimble.” Still, organic-minded millennials are not the only key segment in the vast US food market. Sanderson Farms last summer unveiled a marketing blitz in which a pair of folksy, baseball-cap wearing consumers mock the antibiotic-free craze in television ads that question the scientific link of agriculture to the growth of drug resistance and the wisdom of paying more for antibiotic-free chicken. Joe Sanderson, chief executive of the  62-year-old Mississippi company,  defended the company’s stance in a February 23 conference call. “Everybody does not want that product,” Sanderson said. “And everybody does not believe the claims on that product and nor is that claim important to everybody.” Read more: Antibiotic-free , Food , meat Read full story Recommended Stories Fake stamps: Butcher arrested for selling unhygienic meat Police claim to have seized hundreds of kilogrammes of unauthorised and unhygienic beef Subway disputes study claiming its oven-roasted chicken is only 50 per cent chicken Most of the meat had "very close" to 100 per cent chicken DNA Ostrich farming: New scheme to supply quality meat 5,000 birds will be registered for the purpose Facebook Conversations Leave Your Reply Below Click here to cancel reply.

Phat Tire now has four Arkansas stores as well as two in Tulsa. Tim Robinson and Chris Brosh were in their early 20s when they recognized a glaring omission in Bentonville's blossoming mountain biking scene. It became evident whenever one of their bicycles was damaged while traversing some of the area's trails. To get them fixed, the Bentonville residents typically had to haul their bikes to a repair shop in Fayetteville. Sometimes it would take two or three weeks to get them back. "We thought, 'How is anyone ever going to enjoy this cycling experience we're trying to build here if that's what you have to do to get your bike repaired and worked on?'" Robinson said. "We kind of looked at each other and said, 'Instead of waiting for somebody else to do it, let's open our own shop.'" The conversation proved to be the beginning of Phat Tire Bike Shop, which Robinson and Brosh opened on the Bentonville Square in summer 2007. Nearly 10 years later, the longtime friends -- who are now 33 years old -- remain co-owners of a business that has become a fixture in the region's thriving bike culture. Phat Tire operates four Arkansas-based stores -- in Bentonville, Springdale, Fayetteville and Fort Smith. The company took another step late last year, acquiring two locations in Tulsa. Phat Tire has sold nearly 13,000 bicycles since opening and employs about 50 workers. HUMBLE BEGINNINGS The size of the business is a far cry from its humble beginnings, when the inexperienced owners set up shop in a 2,200-square-foot store in Bentonville. The space is now occupied by Table Mesa Bistro, while Phat Tire's flagship store has moved a couple of blocks away to 125 W. Central Ave. According to their website, the pair decided to name the company after a beer they were drinking one night -- New Belgium Fat Tire. They changed "Fat" to "Phat" and obtained copyright restrictions on the name. Robinson had a background in economics and finance, while Brosh's focus was in small business management and marketing. Together, they put together a business plan that enabled them to secure just enough funding. They leased a store and worked around the clock to prepare for opening day. Phat Tire only had about 30 bikes on the sales floor on opening day and an equally small selection of merchandise. In order to fill up some of the empty space in the store, Robinson and Brosh brought in a couch, some chairs and a rug, putting them in front of a TV that showed bike videos. "When you walked in it was like, 'Oh, this is kind of a cute little shop,'" Robinson said. "But I think because we were from the area people wanted us to be successful." Robinson, who also works at Wal-Mart's home office, focused on the financial side and never held a regular role in the day-to-day operations at the store. Brosh was the store's original manager and had two other employees with him. PROMOTE BIKING Even then, Brosh had big plans for Phat Tire's role in the region's efforts to promote biking. "Growth was a goal and creating something that can grow in not only locations and scale, but in being able to reach the community in positive ways," Brosh said. "We felt like we could make that difference. That was always in our minds." Phat Tire had good timing, according to area biking advocates, tapping into the region's collective efforts to grow as a mountain biking and cycling destination. "The cool thing that has happened here is that cycling has grown, the trails have grown and the bike shops have benefited from the growth for sure," said Alan Ley, the former director of the Arkansas chapter of the National Interscholastic Cycling Association. The Walton Family Foundation, local nonprofit organizations and community leaders took active roles in funding, designing and developing both hard and soft trail systems throughout the region. It has produced miles of accessible trails, including the Slaughter Pen trail system and the Razorback Regional Greenway. "We're going to keep building trails and they're going to keep putting people on bikes," said Brannon Pack, the executive director of Ozark Off-Road Cyclists. "It takes a community and Phat Tire is one piece of that." GRASS-ROOTS APPROACH Phat Tire didn't spend much on traditional advertising to spread the word because there wasn't much money in the early days. Instead, Robinson and Brosh adopted a grass-roots approach, setting up group rides, participating in events and creating social media posts to gain interest. It remains an effective form of advertising for their business. The company has been active in supporting area events, such as the Fat Tire Festival in Eureka Springs and the Slaughter Pen Jam in Bentonville. Phat Tire has been active in laying the groundwork for future mountain bikers as well, becoming a founding sponsor of the National Interscholastic Cycling Association. The organization was founded in 2009 and develops mountain biking programs for students. The Arkansas program, known as the Arkansas Interscholastic Cycling League, was organized in 2015 and held its first races last year. "I think that's going to be the next big wave of how this evolves in this state and in this region is really more of a family focus and getting kids on bikes at a much younger age," Robinson said. Now, Robinson and Brosh are hoping their blueprint in Arkansas will be a success in Tulsa. Phat Tire's expansion into the market began when Brosh met Adam Vanderburg at last year's Fat Tire Festival. Vanderburg, 55, owned two bike shops in Tulsa. One of them was Lee's Bicycles, a historic shop that had been in operation since 1914. But he was considering ways to exit a business that had been run by his family since 1972. POTENTIAL IN TULSA Phat Tire was looking for opportunities and saw potential in Tulsa. The sale was finalized late last year. The company decided to rebrand Lee's Bicycles as Phat Tire, but retained much of the Tulsa team -- including Vanderburg. "I did have a lot of pride wrapped up into it," said Vanderburg, whose new role is as a bicycle advocate. "I wanted somebody to come into the market and have that same passion and pride and connection with the community. So when I [piqued] their interest, I was really excited that they would also be excited about the Tulsa metro market and the culture." Brosh believes Tulsa is a good fit because it's in close proximity to the company's home base. Phat Tire will continue to look for other expansion possibilities within the region, mentioning southeast Kansas, southwest Missouri and Kansas City as potential markets "if growth continues to prove to be smart." "Sometimes it's certainly a little dangerous or risky to grow, and just to grow fast, but I think we, as intelligently as we could, have grown with that understanding and just trying to strike while the iron is hot with people getting into cycling," Brosh said. They're not planning to shift their focus from Northwest Arkansas while pondering future opportunities, evaluating ways to expand and diversify their business locally as well. The company plans to open a Phat Tire Demo store in downtown Rogers next month. The space will be a hub for repairs and bike rentals, while also serving as corporate office space where they can book shuttle services and guided tours all over the state. The store also will begin a new venture with water sport rentals for nearby Lake Atalanta. Phat Tire is hoping to open a similar repair and rental shop in downtown Siloam Springs by July. "It wouldn't have happened at all without the infrastructure and investments that the Walton Family Foundation has made (in the trail system)," Robinson said about the success. "But because that was there, it enabled the private sector to come in and fill that void and I feel like we've done a pretty good job in terms of being a small business and taking on the ownership of what that should look like in the community."

Lehigh Valley 2017 Top Workplaces revealed LV Business Cycle Retail Watch Allentown's Resurrected Consignment sells new and gently used upscale clothing WATCH: Upscale consignment shop opens in Allentown Resurrected Consignment,, an upscale consignment shop, opened Feb. 1 in Allentown. Resurrected Consignment,, an upscale consignment shop, opened Feb. 1 in Allentown. Ryan KnellerContact ReporterValley Shopping Scene Turn heads without turning bankrupt at new Allentown consignment shop. Maybe you're suit-searching for a wedding. Perhaps you're in the market for a prom dress. Or maybe, just maybe, you're in need of a new work wardrobe. No matter what type of clothing you're hunting, you can turn heads without turning bankrupt at the Lehigh Valley's newest consignment shop, Resurrected Consignment. The store, which opened Feb. 1, occupies the former Sign of the Bear Natural Foods space at 514 N. St. Cloud St. in Allentown. Owned by Shannon Atiyeh-Downtain of Allentown, the business sells new and gently used upscale clothing for men and women, along with shoes and accessories such as handbags, hats, jewelry, scarves, ties and wallets. There are casual and formal styles, available in all sizes, from top brands such as Prada, Coach, Michael Kors, John Varvatos, Hugo Boss and Calvin Klein, as well as collectibles such as Barbie dolls, Lladro porcelain figurines and autographed Tiger Woods memorabilia. PHOTO GALLERY: Resurrected Consignment,, an upscale consignment shop, opened Feb. 1 in Allentown. (Harry Fisher) Items you won't find include: underwear, socks, children's and maternity clothing, wedding gowns and Wal-Mart and Kmart brands. According to Atiyeh-Downtain, the store differs from other consignment shops in its high-end merchandise, high level of cleanliness and displays that are not jammed together. "The motto is 'Not Your Mother's Consignment Store,'" she said. "I wanted it to be a pleasant boutique offering an inexpensive shopping experience. It's for people who want to wear nice clothing, but don't necessarily have the money to do so." The shop, featuring two dressing rooms and a seating area, offers 50 percent of an item's sale to the consignor. If you're suddenly getting inspired to clean out your closet, keep in mind the age of an item does not preclude it from the store's racks. "Some shops say the items can only be 2 years old or less," Atiyeh-Downtain said. "For me, if it's a classic style and in good condition, I don't care." Atiyeh-Downtain, who has multiple sclerosis, named the store Resurrected Consignment after a rebirth she's experiencing in her life. "I have not been working for almost 10 years," she said. "So I feel like after dealing with sickness and depression, I'm kind of being reborn." Resurrected Consignment is open 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday, and 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday. Info: 484-221-8281. Over the past seven months, the Hamilton Crossings shopping center in Lower Macungie Township has brought to the Valley a handful of new restaurants, including Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza, BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse, Smashburger and The Foundry pub at Whole Foods. Now, the Krocks Road shopping center is preparing to welcome another Lehigh Valley first: CoreLife Eatery. The 132-seat, fast-casual restaurant, next to Rally House, will open March 24, according to General Manager Richard Hart. It will be the chain's ninth location and first in the state. CoreLife Eatery, founded in 2015 in Syracuse, focuses on "healthy, active lifestyles," sourcing food locally and making every meal from scratch. The menu is based around greens, grains and bone broths with ingredients containing no artificial flavors or colors or high fructose corn syrup. Chicken is hormone- and antibiotic-free. "We're really in that healthy, fresh, whole and clean food sector," co-founder Todd Mansfield said. "... We have no processed foods, no trans fats, no GMOs and no soda." The restaurant, featuring an outdoor patio, will serve the same menu as the chain's other eight locations, with the addition of a roasted vegetable plate. You'll find cold-brewed and fresh-squeezed beverages and about six options (almost all under $9) for each of the following: "green bowls" such as kale Caesar chicken and spicy ginger steak; "grain bowls" such as Thai chicken and rice noodles and sriracha ginger tofu and ancient grains; and "broth bowls" such as broccoli cheddar and grilled chicken tortilla. Create-your-own-bowl options will start at $5.95. Info: eatcore.com. On Broad Street in Bethlehem, one business has closed while another has opened. First, iMobileRescue, offering iPad and iPhone repairs, closed at 97 E. Broad St. The space is listed for rent. Second, Broadway Market opened March 1 a few doors down at 85 E. Broad St. The space previously housed South Philly Pretzel, which closed in December. The market, owned by Anthony Reyes, offers cigarettes, candy, snacks, drinks and more. It has plans to add an ATM and coffee machine soon. Hours are 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday. Info: 908-235-1609. Last week, I highlighted 1774 Grille & Tap, which opened Feb. 26 in the former Ricardo's Original Tavern House space at 605 Main St. in Hellertown. Now, I bring you news of another restaurant to have recently opened on the borough's Main Street. Tasty Dish Chinese Street Food opened a couple of weeks ago at 1184 Main St. in Hellertown, owner Wen Zhou said. The eatery, next to Paprika's Authentic Hungarian Restaurant, serves breakfast crepes ($5.97), featuring a flour mix, egg, green onions, crispy noodles and choice of chicken teriyaki, thinly sliced beef tenderloin, hong shao salmon or vegetable; along with lunchbox combos ($7.97), featuring choice of white or fried rice or noodles, two entrees (such as hong shao eggplant tofu or spicy beef tenderloin) and one side (such as steamed dumplings or Taiwanese popcorn chicken). Drinks include organic coffee and various teas. Info: 484-851-3460. I have a couple developments to report in Quakertown: First, Jersey Mike's Subs, which opened its first Valley shop a couple months ago on Hamilton Boulevard in Trexlertown, debuted its second area location Wednesday at 260 N. West End Blvd. (former Cold Stone Creamery space). The fast-casual restaurant chain, which originated as Mike's Subs in Point Pleasant, N.J., in 1956, promises to offer "a sub above" — complete with locally grown produce, premium brand meats and cheeses and baked-on-site bread. Subs, which can be purchased alone or as part of a meal with chips and a drink, include 10 fresh-sliced varieties such as the Super Sub (provolone, ham, prosciuttini and capocollo) and a dozen fresh-grilled selections such as chicken parm and grilled pastrami Reuben. All subs are available in regular (7-inch) and giant (14.5-inch) sizes, with regular-size prices ranging from $6.75 to $8.50. Info: jerseymikes.com. Second, The Local, a popular farm-to-plate restaurant that closed last summer after six years in Souderton, will find new life in Quakertown. According to chef and owner Alan Worman, he is in the final stages of closing on the Eagle Hotel property at 201 E. Broad St. After taking ownership, he plans to run the restaurant as the Eagle Hotel for about three months, while going through the design and permitting process, before closing the business for another three months for renovations and opening as The Local in late October or early November. The Local, which Worman said he closed due to delays associated with Souderton's renovation of its building, sources nearly all of its meats, cheeses, produce and other ingredients within a 140-mile radius. Worman, of Franconia Township, has established relationships with dozens of area farms, including Hershberger Heritage Farm in West Rockhill Township, Tussock Sedge Farm in Blooming Glen and Sunrise Sunflower Farm in Franconia Township, and plans to partner with even more in Quakertown. "One of the reasons why peaches taste amazing when you buy them from Pappy's Orchard in Coopersburg is because … they were only picked at the best point," said Worman, who grew up eating food from farmers markets overseas. "A peach from the supermarket — who knows? It could be overripe. It could be from Peru, which means it spent two weeks on a boat." The menu in Quakertown will change about twice a season, with examples of what might be offered including oysters, Scotch eggs, foie fries, mussels, duck wings, artisan meat and cheese boards, candied bacon, shrimp tacos and po' boys, house burgers and blackened mahi tacos. The Eagle Hotel, dating to 1803, will be extensively overhauled to include a new 60-seat dining room, walk-in cooler and more. A seasonal outdoor patio will be maintained. The Local, which was BYOB in Souderton, will serve local craft beer and cocktails in Quakertown. Stay up to date on the progress on the business' Facebook page. I'll finish with some news for wine lovers: Mountain View Vineyard at 5866 Neola Road in Jackson Township, Monroe County, is nearing completion of its new larger winery, about two miles away on Walters Road in Hamilton Township. Owners Randy and Linda Rice, who founded the winery in 2009, broke ground on the facility in September on their 27th wedding anniversary. The couple has been operating a tasting room on the ground floor of their home, but the operation outgrew the space. The new winery, expected to debut in May, will feature a stone facade, tasting room with cathedral ceilings, lower-level winemaking facility, wrap-around porch and outdoor space for tented events. Additionally, the Poconos Frogtown family of restaurants is adding a new bistro at the winery. Frogtown Bistro will offer a tapas-style small plate menu featuring classics like crispy chicken with a barbecue glaze and braised short ribs along with more adventurous fare like duck bacon and black truffle pearls. Frogtown co-owner and chef Lyman Winner is planning to incorporate many of Mountain View's wines and spirits into desserts and sauces. Customizable menus will be available for weddings and other events. Mountain View, which added a distillery in 2013, hopes to add its own craft beer to the mix this year. Info: 570-619-0053.

Last month, Tyson Foods announced a "no antibiotics ever" pledge for all Tyson-branded chicken products, building on an earlier promise to restrict drug use on broiler chickens. Analysts see the latest Tyson announcement as further evidence of a trend of large companies limiting pharmaceuticals that scientists believe increases drug-resistance for treating pneumonia, infections and other illnesses in humans. The wave started in 2014 with Perdue Chicken and chicken-based fast-food chain Chick-fil-A, followed by McDonald's, Wal-Mart Stores, Pilgrim's Pride and others. The announcements vary in scope, with some companies, for example, still permitting use of ionophores, antibiotics not used in human medicine. The shift follows warnings about antibiotic resistance from health officials and a September 2016 United Nations General Assembly resolution that pledged coordinated action to address overuse. "We're seeing a cry from consumers for meat that's responsibly raised," said Lena Brook, a food policy advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). Still, the breadth of the movement should not be overstated. While an estimated 40 to 50 percent of US chicken now is antibiotic-free, the percentage is far lower for pork and beef. Moreover, several leading companies have resisted action. Kentucky Fried Chicken, part of Yum Brands, currently scores an "F" on an NRDC scorecard on antibiotics policy, while Sanderson Farms, a leading US chicken producer, has lampooned the trend. "There's certainly strong and growing demand for it today, but to what extent it's a fad or a long-term trend remains to be seen," said Zain Akbari, a food industry analyst at Morningstar. - Antibiotic-free premium - Advocates of stricter antibiotic use are pressing for action on beef and pork too, and are preparing a shareholder resolution for McDonald's annual meeting Experts in animal farm science say US farmers for decades routinely employed antibiotics as a means to speed growth rates for animals, and to prevent disease outbreaks on farms where animals are frequently packed in close quarters. But an April 2014 World Health Organization report warned of the potential for a "post-antibiotic era" in which "common infections and minor injuries can kill" as drugs become ineffective. In voluntary guidelines that took effect in January, the US Food and Drug Administration said antibiotics in agriculture should be limited to medically necessary uses and not for weight gain. The call by public officials has dovetailed with heightened consciousness about food in broader American society that has also propelled organic food. Instead of antibiotics, Tyson is turning to probiotics and to botanicals such as oregano and thyme for routine treatment, while still employing antibiotics if birds become sick, a spokesman said. Tyson, which has faced shareholder resolutions in recent years on its water policy and other sustainability issues, also plans to limit antibiotics in pork, beef and turkey, although it has not yet set target dates. "We're eliminating human antibiotics because it's the most responsible approach to balance a global health concern and animal well-being," a Tyson spokesman told AFP. "Antibiotics resistance is a very complex issue with no single cause and no single solution. It's a global concern and we want to be part of the solution." As other companies have done, Tyson began with chicken, in part because chicken farms tend to be vertically organized within companies, compared with pork and beef, which involve contracts with outside farmers. That means the company would need to institute programs that impact its suppliers, analysts say. - Is beef next? - Advocates of stricter antibiotic use are pressing for action on beef and pork too, and are preparing a shareholder resolution for McDonald's annual meeting. Since beef already has more premium grades, adding antibiotic-free products could be another opportunity to introduce a pricier product, said Akbari, the Morningstar analyst. Akbari said much of the current push is in response to millennials, who increasingly will "force retailers and producers to be pretty nimble." Still, organic-minded millennials are not the only key segment in the vast US food market. Sanderson Farms last summer unveiled a marketing blitz in which a pair of folksy, baseball-cap wearing consumers mock the antibiotic-free craze in television ads that question the scientific link of agriculture to the growth of drug resistance and the wisdom of paying more for antibiotic-free chicken. Joe Sanderson, chief executive of the 62-year-old Mississippi company, defended the company's stance in a February 23 conference call. "Everybody does not want that product," Sanderson said. "And everybody does not believe the claims on that product and nor is that claim important to everybody."

Abby Drey Centre Daily Times, file i By Bill Lamont LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Could 2017 be the year that you begin a vegetable garden or plant some flowers outdoors? If so, here are a few considerations that might make your venture more enjoyable. When is comes to growing plants, you can always find a place to plant. Outdoor beds in the soil are indeed the most popular, but a lack of space shouldn’t hold you back. You can use hanging baskets, small borders or edging surrounding existing plants, window boxes or containers on the porch or deck for planting space. This is where you can let your imagination take over. If you do not have an area of soil, you can even plant into bags of growing media or potting soil that you purchase from Lowes, Home Depot, Wal-Mart and garden centers located around the area. Simply cut an opening in the plastic bag of growing material and put the plant into it. Gardening in a bag. A word of caution: If you do have room to put your first garden in a bed, start small. Given an efficient layout, a 15-by-25 bed area is very adequate for a full-blown vegetable garden. You can always expand next year after you get some experience under your belt. Most vegetable crops need as much sun as possible. Six or more hours of full sun each day should be enough to assure a good harvest. If you find that your garden is shaded, try leafy vegetables such as lettuce and shade tolerant flowers. They will give you a harvest with minimum sunlight. Many vegetables are quite adaptable for container growing if sunlight is available. Every first-time gardener should have a few of the basic tools to get started. For the first season, I suggest a shovel, garden rake, hoe and towel for planting. These tools will allow you to adequately prepare the soil or beds. A few seed catalogs or gardening texts available from the Penn State Extension publications that can be view on line that will give you endless ideas on planting and soil management. It is important to read ahead of the actual season to become familiar with what might happen in the garden so you will be ready for any problems. That should get you growing this year.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries E-edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site 1985-Present 1831-1950 Local business notes: Small part of Shea's Route 66 Museum lives on Saturday Mar 11, 2017 at 6:54 PM Mar 11, 2017 at 6:54 PM Tim Landis Business Editor @TimLandisSJR A piece of the former SHEA'S ROUTE 66 MUSEUM survives in Springfield. Jeff Fulgenzi purchased and relocated the centerpiece MAHAN'S STATION in early 2016 to a site on the east side of Fulgenzi's Pizza and Pasta, 1168 Sangamon Ave. The 1920s-era gas station was included in the Shea's collection sold at auction in the fall of 2015. Shea's museum, long a major tourist draw on Route 66 in Illinois, closed after the 2013 death of founder William "Bill" Shea. While Mahan's is not an "official" city museum-visitor center for Route 66, travelers on the historic road find their way to the restored station. "We've welcomed visitors from all over the world," said Fulgenzi, who continues to rebuild the Route 66 collection housed within. The black-on-orange "Mahan Filling Station" sign remains on the entrance with old-style Phillips 66, DX and Red Crown gasoline pumps out front. The small museum includes a collection of license plates, a couple of old-school bicycles and other Route 66 memorabilia. Fulgenzi said he would like to see Springfield join other communities at some point with a combined museum-welcome center highlighting area history and local ties to Route 66. "I have advocated for quite some time that we need a regional heritage museum, which includes Route 66," Fulgenzi said. Mahan Station hours coincide with the restaurant's. *** A note on the Feb. 18 item on an ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES lease of the former Barney's Furniture building, at 2410 South Grand Ave. E. Barney's owner Barry Seidman no longer owns the building on South Grand Avenue, which was sold to a private investment group. Barney's Furniture relocated last year to expanded space at 1987 Wabash Ave. DHS has begun remodeling the South Grand building for use as a downstate files warehouse. *** Construction of the 11TH STREET EXTENSION should begin in coming weeks. The Illinois Department of Transportation is analyzing construction bids opened March 3 for the approximately half-mile road connecting Stevenson Drive to Lincolnshire Boulevard. The connection has been discussed off and on for decades as a way to create an 11th Street corridor from the city to the University of Illinois Springfield campus. Support has picked up in recent years as a result of retail-commercial development in the area of Wal-Mart on South Sixth Street. Transportation officials say the extension also should help ease congestion on Sixth Street between Interstate 72 and Stanford Avenue. Previous estimates have put the project cost at a little more than $8 million. The bid award will determine the actual cost. *** There was no land-based casino for Springfield in a recent legislative proposal to expand Illinois gambling, but the city continues to lead the state in VIDEO GAMING terminals, according to the latest figures from the Illinois Gaming Board. At the end of January, 128 locations operated 580 video gambling machines in Springfield compared with 120 locations and 533 terminals a year earlier. Second-place Rockford had 97 locations and 434 terminals at the end of January compared with 89 locations and 425 terminals in January 216. Six land-based casinos were included in the gambling expansion legislation, including in Rockford, Chicago, two in Lake County, Danville and Williamson County in southern Illinois. *** WORLD OF POWERSPORTS has purchased OVERTURF POWER SPORTS, according to a joint announcement from the two companies. Dennis and Karen Overturf are retiring after more than 30 years in business, the companies said. Overturf Powersports' inventory has been moved to The World of Powersports store at 3230 Atlanta St., just off North Dirksen Parkway. Decatur-based World of Powersports has been in business for more than two decades, carrying motorcycles, ATVs, scooters, watercraft and snowmobiles. In addition to Decatur and Springfield, the company has locations in Peoria and Bloomington. World of Powersports is part of the Jackson Family Dealerships, including Jackson Ford in Decatur and Jackson Chevrolet in Sullivan. The website is worldofpowersports.com. The Springfield phone number is 528-5226. *** HAGERTY EQUIPMENT of Peoria has added a location at 1900 S. Dirksen Parkway. The industrial and contractor supply and service company also has locations in Decatur and Davenport, Iowa, according to the company website, hagertybrothers.com. The local phone number is 679-4365. *** WXAJ-FM has launched 99-7 THE MIX, according to an announcement from station owner Neuhoff Media. The station had been branded as 99.7 KISS FM since 2001. The adult contemporary 99-7 will carry hits of from the '90s through today, according to the announcement. The station also is available on mobile devices. The website is 997themix.com. *** Not all the big retailers are cutting back. DICK'S SPORTING GOODS just announced the opening of stores in Florida, Arizona and California. The company is nearing 700 stores nationwide, including at White Oaks Mall in Springfield. *** PET SUPPLIES PLUS has filed plans with the city for renovation of space at 1861 Sangamon Ave. The franchise chain has 11 stores in Illinois, including Jacksonville, according to the company website, petsuppliesplus.com.

Donald Trump will focus on the one set of economic policies a president can pursue without close congressional cooperation Subscribe to our newsletter. Barry Eichengreen Donald Trump and congressional Republicans are learning that replacing Obamacare is easier said than done. Photo: Bloomberg Donald Trump took office promising a raft of sweeping economic-policy changes for the US. He has quickly discovered, like previous US presidents, that America’s political system is designed to prevent rapid, large-scale change, by interposing formidable institutional obstacles, from the Congress and career civil servants to state governments and the courts. Start with reform of personal income tax. This should be a slam-dunk, because the president and congressional Republican leaders are on the same page. Trump’s goal of removing the government’s groping hand from Americans’ pockets, by cutting the top marginal tax rate on ordinary income from 39.5% to 33%, is entirely consistent with mainstream Republican ideology, according to which high tax rates penalize success and stifle innovation. But, to be politically viable, significant tax cuts for the wealthy would have to be accompanied by at least token tax cuts for the middle class. And broad-based tax cuts would blow a hole in the budget and excite congressional deficit hawks, of whom there are still a few. One can imagine closing loopholes to render rate cuts revenue neutral. But one person’s loophole is another’s entitlement. Even if there are economic arguments for eliminating, say, the deductibility of mortgage interest payments, imagine the howls of protest from homeowners, including many Trump voters, who borrowed to purchase their houses. Imagine the reaction of Trump’s friends in real estate. Cuts on the spending side would assuage the deficit hawks. And big cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency, the US Agency for International Development, and National Public Radio are high on the Republican hit list. But the vast majority of federal spending is on entitlements, the military, and other proverbial “third rail” items that elected officials touch at their peril. Simply put, broad-based spending cuts to match broad-based income-tax reductions are not politically feasible. Eliminating federal subsidies for health-insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) would save the government a little over $100 billion a year, about 3% of federal spending. But those subsidies are largely paid for by their own dedicated taxes. Moreover, Trump and congressional Republicans are learning that replacing Obamacare is easier said than done. Healthcare reform, as Hillary Clinton could have told them, is fearsomely complex. It is increasingly clear that the name will change (“Trumpcare,” anyone?), and it can be expected that the Republican plan will cover fewer people; but much of the substance will remain the same. Because corporate taxes are less significant in terms of overall federal revenue, rate cutting doesn’t pose a comparable threat to the budget balance. But here there is no agreement between Congress and the Trump administration on the form such cuts should take. House speaker Paul Ryan and others favour moving to a border adjustment tax that would tax corporate cash flows regardless of where the goods sold by US companies are produced, while exempting exports. Others, such as treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, are evidently sceptical. And an important part of Trump’s business constituency—import-dependent retailers like Target and Walmart—are actively hostile. Agreement on a plan won’t come easily. Trump’s other flagship proposal is a $1 trillion infrastructure programme. But this initiative will run headlong into deficit concerns, and it is fundamentally at odds with Republican scepticism about big government, and specifically about the public sector’s capacity to carry out investment plans efficiently. Trump will want to be able to point to a few signature projects. He will want his border wall with Mexico. But any new federal infrastructure spending is likely to be more symbolic than real. So what will an impatient president, frustrated and hemmed in on all sides, do? First, Trump will focus on the one set of economic policies a president can pursue without close congressional cooperation, namely those affecting trade. He can invoke the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, restricting imports on the grounds that they threaten US “material interests”. He can invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 on the grounds that the loss of jobs to Mexico and China constitutes an economic emergency. Second, Trump will respond, as populists do, by attempting to distract attention from his failure to deliver the economic goods. This means directing his ire and that of his supporters towards others—whether internal enemies like the press, the intelligence community, and Barack Obama, or external adversaries like the Islamic State and China. It wouldn’t be the first time a politician used a domestic political crusade or a foreign policy adventure to divert attention from his economic failures. We have already seen Trump’s tendency to lash out at perceived enemies, foreign and domestic. And we know that this confrontational style is the modus operandi of senior White House advisers like Stephen Bannon and Stephen Miller. We can hope that cooler heads prevail. But, given the constraints on implementing Trump’s economic agenda, it’s hard to be optimistic. ©2017/PROJECT SYNDICATE Barry Eichengreen is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Cambridge.

School districts need to be consolidated to reduce taxes. The Regional Office of Education should be leading the charge for consolidation. The salaries and benefits of most government workers (federal, state, county, city) is way out of line with the private sector and needs to be adjusted accordingly. Enough sculptures, already Enough already. No more sculptures from Art on the Square, even if they’re nice ones. The city of Belleville is beginning to look junky and cluttered. Lessons of protest I hope OTHS disciplines those students who walked out of school in protest. If they don’t, they are setting a bad precedent. Be ready for more walkouts. ‘No’ on police penny tax The Belleville police department should be doing their job and not knocking on doors advocating for a tax increase. Very poor judgment on the mayor and chief of police. If the police department can’t live within their budget, it’s time for a leadership change. Tax increases are not the answer. Vote no for the penny tax increase and ditto for the school districts. It’s time for a change with government employee salaries and benefits. Their expectations are totally unrealistic compared to the private sector. Sales taxes for signs Every time the subject of increased crime in Belleville comes up, I like to ask, what is the most common sign seen in Belleville neighborhoods? It’s the “Neighborhood Watch” sign on every street. Recent comments by BND readers indicate Belleville Chief Clay is missing in action, when it comes to stopping the increase of neighborhood crime in Belleville. Evidently, neither Neighborhood Watch signage nor Chief Clay do much to deter residential crime. I know, Belleville needs more money to buy more signs and for Clay to spend. Property tax increases will remedy that? Right. Show us police blotter Chief Clay says that Belleville is so safe. What about the three sexual assaults that happened last year and the more recent one? Where’s the police blotter? We need to know what’s going on and not just take Clay’s word for it. East St. Louis Township toodle-oo Oliver Hamilton received just a slap on the wrist for his misuse of public funds. This is ridiculous. Money for nothing at MidAmerica St. Clair County has spent millions of dollars on Mid-America Airport and it sits empty most of the time. We approved a bonus for the director to sit and watch an empty building. We approved money to expand the parking lot for an empty building. This is a joke and an absolute waste of taxpayer money. Athletics make the school I recently attended a Collinsville Unit 10 school board meeting, and was embarrassed for our town. As topics were discussed, board members would look over to the bully in the room, waiting for his negative input. There are seven members on the board. A majority of our tax dollars, 63 percent, go to the school district. Any discussions on athletics are of no interest. Who is responsible for investing in the success of the athletic programs; board members, administration, athletic director? The argument is the focus should be on the students. Many studies point to the fact that successful athletic programs encourage success in the classroom, better graduation rates, less disciplinary issues, and school and community spirit. Ready for township trough Apparently, Richard Donovan has not had his appetite satisfied for eating at the taxpayer-funded public trough. For most of his adult life he has had politically-appointed jobs — first at the jail, then transferred over to the Court House, and then finally demoted out to St. Clair County Animal Control until his retirement. Now, he wants to run for Caseyville Township supervisor. Spare us his arrogance and know-it-all attitude. Crockett’s criminal charges? What ever happened to the Board of Review member, Micheal Crockett Jr., who allegedly took the bribe? Is he still doing tax corrections? If so who’s watching him? You get what you pay for It was disappointing to read the recent Sound-off potshot taken at O’Fallon School District 203 Superintendent Darcy Benway for her perceived hefty salary. You can’t fault Benway, who doesn’t determine her pay, and she has financial wants and needs just like everyone else. Generally speaking, you get what you pay for, and her position being one of Illinois’ top 100 highest-paid high school administrators helps to ensure that O’Fallon students continue to get a top notch educational experience. No state budget, no lawmaker pay I am so sick and tired of this Illinois budget stand off. I know there was a time when elected officials weren’t supposed to be paid until a budget was passed. Let’s have Sen. Tom Cullerton live on my income of less than $900 a month and on my insurance. Trade salary for salary, benefits for benefits. Cook clueless on crime In Dallas Cook’s candidate profile, he suggests the best way to fight crime is to have an officer sit in their car in locations of high crime. Does no one else think this is ridiculous? The MotoMart at Sixth and Main is notorious for shady people and activity. The police station is literally across the street, and its presence has done nothing to deter these people. Come on Dallas, get a clue. Elephant in donkey clothing Warning to all St. Clair County Democrats: Who is Dean Hardt? Dean Hardt has lied to the taxpayers. Dean Hardt has never attended a St. Clair County Democrat function. Dean Hardt has never paid for lug tickets. Now the St. Clair County Democrats are including his literature with theirs and even passing it out for him. Dean Hardt is a big Republican. He may tell you to look at his voting records but dig a little deeper. This St. Clair County Democrat is outraged. Laughing it up on my dime I was at the health department the other day to take care of some restaurant business. When I arrived, there were four employees gathered around the receptionist desk laughing and having a good time. I figured they would clear out when I got to the desk, but no way. They stayed there having a good time while I conducted my business. I considered it rude. But more to the point, I am a St. Clair County taxpayer. My tax dollars help pay those employees’ salaries. I think I am getting a raw deal. If this is all they have to do, maybe Chairman Kern should make some cuts. TIF taken from taxpayers When Mayor Eckert gives TIFs to millionaires, it is not the city that does this. It is money taken from hard-working taxpayers and given to businesses. The taxpayers are being forced to give this money away, not the city of Belleville. Property tax smarts If what Mayor Eckert is doing is such smart business, then why does everyone in Belleville have to pay 4 and a half percent more this year in property taxes? TIF for that? Mayor Eckert is touting his Walmart project as a good investment. He fails to mention the old Walmart on Carlyle Avenue and the old Kmart out on Illinois 13. These are now derelict projects that received city money. Mayor, you are out of line and lying when you say that we can get our money back. Potshots at distracted lawmakers I agree with the BND editorial on Costello and FOID card. First it was the bobcats, then the color of hunters’ clothing, and now the FOID card. What is with this guy? Also, let’s add Bill Haine to the list with his gun silencer bill. If a hunter has a noise problem how about ear protection? With all the problems in Chicago with guns, this is what they come up with. Neither one will get my vote as they are unqualified to lead. Losing our appetite Big Mama’s, Pigs In A Poke, Maxwell’s, and now Fischer’s. Nothing left in Belleville but chains and franchises that are everywhere. No need to come to Belleville anymore. This is what high property taxes and high business taxes and insurance has caused. Ten more years and Main Street will just be an extension of State Street. Freeburg school board politics Freeburg Community High School District 77 voters, get involved and spread the word. Don’t give away control of your school to the group of four running as a slate. Write-in for Freeburg High board Gary Henning was removed from the April election ballot for Freeburg High School District 77 School Board by his opposition. Don’t let them control who we elect on our school board. Write in Gary “Hendog” Henning on your ballot. Mistrusting sales taxes Does anybody really believe that this tax increase is going to go to the schools and police department instead of into somebody’s pocket? Need there, trust missing I’m having a hard time supporting the tax increase in St. Clair County. I understand that emergency service and law enforcement needs money. Many times, the money from these new taxes doesn’t go where it needs to go. $400,000 head start Collinsville has cut back it’s closing time for bars by requiring them to close an hour earlier than they had been to bring them more in line with surrounding communities, yet Sloan’s Pub House has complained at the last two city council meetings. This is the same bar that the city gave $400,000 in TIF funds and they are still begging the city for privileges to help them turn a profit when they have a $400,000 head start on any competition.

After nearly 10 years since Gus Macker was last in town, April House Children's Advocacy Center in Morrison is getting the Sauk Valley back in the game. The popular 3-on-3 basketball tournament will return from around 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. June 17 and 18 at Northland Mall, 2900 E Lincolnway in Sterling. Early registration will be from 4 to 7 p.m. June 16. Kristina Kaecker, governing board president for April House and a previous participant of Gus Macker, said the tournament has been away long enough for people to get really excited about it again. In previous years, the event was put on by the Sterling High School Athletic Booster Club and the YMCA. Previous fundraisers for April House have included golf outings, painting classes and dueling pianos, but organizers wanted to "find a fundraiser that people would be excited about," said Johanna Hager, executive director of April House. Those events were great, but they "wanted to do something different," Kaecker said. She added that the tournament will be more family friendly this time around. Many participants thought past tournaments could get pretty heated, she said. This year, they are hiring professional referees, so it is no longer a "you call it" game. There will be a men's court, a women's court and the dream court for kids ages 5 to 13. The event will call for of at least 150 volunteers for each day of the tournament. Volunteers will help with security, score keeping, setup and registration. Walmart has partnered with the tournament to send some of its employees through the Volunteerism Always Pays program. They will then donate an hourly wage back to April House, almost as if the employees got paid to work that day. Kaecker said April House's goal is to spread awareness about the facility and any funds raised after they cover the cost of the tournament would be a bonus. She hopes to have more than 300 teams participate. At its largest, the tournament had 1400 teams. Proceeds will support April House in its mission to help victims of sexual and physical abuse in Whiteside County. Four years ago, the center was close to shutting down due to a lack in state funding and mounting bills, but through fundraisers and community donations, it was able to stay open. Kaecker said there has "been a good response from community" about the event so she is hopeful everything will come together.

Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. Westmoreland County Coroner Ken Bacha has no doubt the human remains uncovered from a makeshift grave last week are those of missing Vandergrift woman Ronny Marie Cable but said it could take weeks for a positive identification. “We have no reason to believe it's anybody but (Cable), but those remains ... because of the poor condition ... have been placed in the custody of the experts at the Mercyhurst University forensic anthropology team for official, scientific identification,” Bacha said Sunday. “That could be weeks before that formal positive identification is completed.” Mercyhurst's renowned forensics team, headed by Dr. Dennis Dirkmaat, assisted the coroner's office and county detectives in retrieving the 34-year-old woman's remains Friday from a remote wooded area off Strawcutter Road in Derry Township. The coroner routinely has Cyril H. Wecht and Pathology Associates complete autopsies, but the poor condition of the remains forced the office to summon Mercyhurst's expertise, Bacha said. “The remains went to Mercyhurst, and everything else discovered at the scene, such as her jewelry and other personal items, are in the custody of our office and county detectives,” Bacha said. Bacha and county Detective Ray Dupilka both declined to disclose how Cable may have been killed because of the ongoing forensic analysis and criminal investigation. “We are still very actively working on it,” Dupilka said. District Attorney John Peck disclosed Saturday that detectives were investigating the death as a homicide. He said detectives have identified suspects in the case. Cable was seen on surveillance cameras at the Wal-Mart in Harrison on the evening of Feb. 16 with two white men, whom police have not identified. Vandergrift police said Cable was seen with the same men at her home later that night. All three left in a red Chevrolet car. The last time a charge was made on Cable's bank account was the following night at a bar in a neighboring town. Police said she had not used her phone since Feb. 16. Cable's cousin Valerie Parillo of Kent, Ohio, said family members are “just completely devastated over this.” “This tragedy has just rocked our foundation to our core. ... Never would you believe something would happen like this in your family,” said Parillo, who is three years younger than Cable. “Seeing the site where she was found ... just abandoned off a dirt road, flanked in white snow, brings to mind every horror movie I've ever seen.” Cable's two young children have been in the custody of relatives, Parillo said. Other family members contacted Sunday declined comment. Parillo asked the public to not judge Cable too harshly for her minor run-ins with the law — possession of a controlled substance in Jeannette in 2012 and a theft in Greensburg in 2013. “No doubt, she had some personal challenges. ... She was addicted to methadone at one point ... but every day she tried to improve herself,” Parillo said. Parillo pointed to a Facebook post Cable made Feb. 5 about those life improvement efforts. “A few bad chapters does not mean your story is over,” Cable posted. “That was definitely Ronny,” Parillo said. “Ronny was really good at styling hair. ... She had worked as a beautician. She had a great sense of humor and was a good person, but again she may have had some issues, but she was trying to improve herself.” Parillo said the family hopes to schedule a memorial service for Cable in the future. “Family members were told by investigators they believe it was her,” Parillo said.

An Edina business is out to make it as popular as its food counterpart.  By John Ewoldt Star Tribune March 13, 2017 — 10:54am ELIZABETH FLORES Vishal Naithani, second from right, is the owner of Sustained Organic Living also known as Sol Organics in Edina. Also pictured are - from left to right - Ashwin Hazari, Raj Badola, Vishal Naithani, and Sachin Chauhan. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint Organic cotton textiles register no more than a footnote in the world’s cotton production, but Vishal Naithani wants to change that. His company, Sustained Organic Living in Edina, selects certified organic cotton grown in India with non-GMO seeds. The products are made using only fair trade labor on the farms and in the factories. The challenge for Naithani and his company, which is also known as Sol Organics, is to be able to create the level of interest among consumers for organic apparel that has been generated for organic food. For now, his chief weapon is price: He aims to price his products significantly lower than his online competitors and on par with high-quality bedding that is not fair trade organic. “Every family should have access to affordable organic cotton just like they have access to affordable organic food,” he said. “It shouldn’t be only the wealthy who can afford premium products.” Sol Organics is one of a number of companies offering organic, fair trade textiles online or in stores. Companies such as Boll & Branch and Patagonia sell them. West Elm, Pottery Barn, and Target feature organic cotton that may or may not be fair trade. Naithani said Sol Organics is the only Minnesota-based company to do so. Part of the reason Naithani acts as a maverick is that organic cotton hasn’t grabbed the consumer’s attention like organic milk, produce and poultry. Sustained Organic Living at a glance Origin: Health and wellness market for 20 years; added organic sheets in 2016. Revenue: $7 million in aromatherapy wraps and candles in 2016 and $1 million (projected in 2017) for organic bedding. Products: Certified organic cotton, fair trade sheets, duvets, shams, and crib sheets plus warming therapy and diffusers. Coming soon: Sol Baby starter kit, flannel sheets, down and wool comforters, alpaca blankets. Certification: Sol’s farms use Fair Trade USA and Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS). The factories use Fairtrade Labelling Organization. Advantages/disadvantages of organic cotton: Reviewers say the cotton is softer but wrinkles a bit more. Naithani said organic cotton lasts longer. Contact: Sheets are sold at solorganix.com or at Sol’s offices at 7301 Washington Av. S., Edina. Open daily. Call 952-829-0400 for hours. “Shoppers aren’t ingesting organic cotton as they do organic foods, so they may not see the benefit,” said Mary Brett Whitfield, senior vice president at Kantar Retail, a retail consulting business. “We haven’t trained shoppers to think about how cotton is grown or how it fits in the environmental food chain.” Conventionally grown cotton’s critics say the so-called “fabric of our lives” is a crop that requires lots of water and chemicals to grow. A pesticide-intensive crop, conventional cotton uses more than an average amount of pesticides, although the amount is in dispute. Cotton covers 2.5 percent of the world’s cultivated land, yet growers use an estimated 10 to 25 percent of the world’s pesticides, according to Rodale Institute, a Pennsylvania organic farm and researcher. AMIS Global, an agriculture data firm, estimates the pesticide usage for cotton at closer to 5 percent, according to Cotton Inc., a U.S. trade organization. In India, where more than 20 percent of the world’s cotton is grown, child labor is common. According to a Harris Poll conducted in 2016, three in five consumers would not purchase a cotton product if they knew it was picked by children or forced labor. Naithani and others in the business believe that, in time, more consumers will search out organic sheets, towels and clothing. Only 5 percent of consumers purchase organic clothing, slightly higher among millennials, according to Kantar Retail. The average price paid for a queen sheet set in the U.S. is $80, but organic cotton sets (300 thread count sateen) start at $240 at BollandBranch.com and $258 at Coyuchi.com. At the wholesale level, organic, fair trade cotton costs only about 15 percent more than conventional cotton, Naithani said. He doubles the cost of the goods for his retail price while competitors triple the cost, he said. The only way to get people to convert to buying organic cotton is to keep prices competitive. “Costco and Wal-Mart have made organic food affordable,” he said. “We want to do the same for organic cotton.” At $119 for a queen set and $139 for a king set at solorganix.com (after a $40 instant savings), his prices are 30 to 50 percent less than comparable products online, but still nearly double what a conventional set costs at Kohl’s or J.C. Penney. Naithani hopes to drop the price of his queen-sized set to $99 within two years, once the product reaches critical mass. “Affordability is the tipping point,” he said. “It promotes access, which in turn creates demand and conversion to organic cotton.” Brett Whitfield sees organic cotton as early in its life cycle but poised for growth. Target and Pottery Barn recently expanded their organic textiles selection. Pottery Barn’s spring collections show fair trade, organic sheets and towels. Target, which already had organic cotton sheets, clothes and baby items, added organic in its new Cat & Jack kids line. Its recent pledge to remove perfluorinated chemicals and flame retardants from textiles by 2022 shows a long-term commitment. “We know organic cotton is important to our guests,” said Erika Winkels, a Target spokeswoman. “It will continue to grow in the future, whether it’s home or apparel. It’s not the be-all-end-all, but it’s important.” Naithani, who also sells his product on Amazon, hopes to break $1 million in annual sheet sales by next month. That’s still a fraction of the online retailer Boll & Branch, which sold about $40 million in organic fair trade sheets and towels in 2016. Sol’s products are getting four- and five-star reviews online. His return rate is an enviably low 2.5 percent. “Increasing the demand for organic cotton creates this tremendous upside where everyone wins, the farmer, the consumer and the earth,” he said.     jewoldt@startribune.com 612-673-7633 View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Don’t be too shocked if a 6-foot-tall Merman makes your acquaintance. And it’s OK to feel a little spooked if a life-size scarecrow seems to eye you on the way out. For Greg and Jennifer Duffy, Halloween night rolls around each and every day. “I think if you don’t love Halloween, you’re probably not human,” said Greg, with a wry smile. The couple runs their sci-fi/horror store on Highway 21 near Carowinds as a retail opportunity for their passion project, Creature Revenge Studios. Out of their cozy space in the Carowinds Crossing Shopping Center, the two spend countless hours designing, sketching, sculpting and painting original (and rather convincing) monster movie masks to sell to movie studios, apparel shops and enthusiasts. The shop scheduled a grand opening celebration March 11. If you want to check out what the Duffy’s are working on, they installed a large windowpane that peeks in from the store to their adjoined studio. “A lot of people don’t understand the art that goes into what we make,” said Duffy, who has been making masks with Jennifer for about five years. “To them, it may just be a piece of rubber. But even the mask you pick up at Wal-Mart has to come from some place, and it had to turn from nothing into something for you to buy it. There’s a craft and an art to this most people take for granted.” Masks cost about $20 and up, online at thecreaturescrypt.com. There’s also a bevy of unique merchandise at the store, including collectibles, books, toys, movies, model kits and apparel. The Duffy’s say most of their pieces are appropriate for hard-wired fans and those who are just getting into the horror genre. If you’re not careful, you’ll spend an hour watching classic black-and-white scary movies on the shop’s two dueling projection screens. The Duffy’s live for Halloween, but they contract with major projects the whole year round. Greg recently finished a project with Sony Pictures, where he sculpted work with the “Men in Black” line. The couple are always looking to work with entertainment havens such as Scarowinds, Six Flags and haunted houses. The pair once created a zombie fortune teller named “Zombo The Great” for an online TV pilot. But with the store open for all ghouls and gals, they’re looking forward to sharing the Halloween aura year-round. “It’s that repetition of doing it so much and getting so into it, and loving it so much that you do it over and over again,” Duffy said. “And you eat, sleep and breathe it, and you can see yourself and your art grow, and that’s really exciting.” David Thackham writes a weekly column called Trending in York County, which takes a dive into local eateries, stores and businesses that York County consumers are flocking to right now.

Search Watch Live Home UK Brexit Trump World Business Politics Tech Entertainment Offbeat Weather Privet pips HMV owner in race for Thunderbirds toy-maker Vivid Vivid, the UK's biggest toy-maker, will change hands this week following a troubled period, Sky News understands. 05:28, UK, Monday 13 March 2017 Image Caption: Vivid makes Thunderbirds toys Twitter Facebook Google+ Whats App Mail By Mark Kleinman, City Editor A private equity firm which targets struggling companies will this week triumph in a two-way battle for control of Britain's biggest toy-maker. Sky News has learnt that Privet Capital and Hilco, which has transformed the fortunes of HMV, the entertainment retailer, tabled takeover bids for Vivid in the last few days. Sources said on Sunday that Privet was close to securing a deal to buy Vivid Toy Group, which has licences to make Thunderbirds and Moshi Monsters toys, and could announce a takeover as soon as Monday. They added that any transaction would be through a solvent sale process, and would not require an insolvency mechanism such as a pre-pack administration. Vivid is backed by the investment firm Phoenix Equity Partners, and has seen a slump in profits after a big bet on a new Thunderbirds range turned sour. Last month, it asked KPMG's accelerated mergers and acquisitions team to identify new investors following an earlier sale process which failed to produce a buyer. The expected sale will come weeks after a privacy storm erupted in Germany over a talking doll called Cayla which is distributed by Vivid. The toy's smart technology can reveal personal data to hackers, prompting warnings by an official watchdog over its use by children. A company source insisted that Thunderbirds had had "a successful launch year in 2015 and continues to be an important brand in the Vivid portfolio". Vivid is Britain's biggest toy company and, according to its website, is the 20th largest in the world. It was set up in 1993, since when it has made action figures from films and television programmes such as Toy Story, Spiderman and Star Trek, as well as products aimed at pre-school children themed on Winnie the Pooh and Rosie & Jim. Surrey-based Vivid sells to 60 countries around the world and supplies retailers including Argos, Tesco, Wal-Mart and Amazon. "This is a profitable business with annual revenue of approximately £83m and positive EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation)," a source said. Phoenix, which has owned a stake in Vivid since 2002, declined to comment. The private equity firm's fund originated in 2001 and is now approaching the end of its life, which is among the reasons it is seeking a replacement shareholder, a source said. Privet Capital specialises in operational turnarounds of companies, with its most prominent employee the former Serco chief executive, Chris Hyman. Both Privet and Hilco also declined to comment.

Photo - Reuters/Carlos Barria   Sharelines What’s a president to do? #What’s a president to do? Donald Trump took office promising a raft of sweeping economic-policy changes for the United States. He has quickly discovered, like previous US presidents, that America’s political system is designed to prevent rapid, large-scale change, by interposing formidable institutional obstacles, from the Congress and career civil servants to state governments and the courts. Start with reform of personal income tax. This should be a slam-dunk, because the president and congressional Republican leaders are on the same page. Trump’s goal of removing the government’s groping hand from Americans’ pockets, by cutting the top marginal tax rate on ordinary income from 39.5 per cent to 33 per cent, is entirely consistent with mainstream Republican ideology, according to which high tax rates penalize success and stifle innovation. But, to be politically viable, significant tax cuts for the wealthy would have to be accompanied by at least token tax cuts for the middle class. And broad-based tax cuts would blow a hole in the budget and excite congressional deficit hawks, of whom there are still a few. One can imagine closing loopholes to render rate cuts revenue neutral. But one person’s loophole is another’s entitlement. Even if there are economic arguments for eliminating, say, the deductibility of mortgage interest payments, imagine the howls of protest from homeowners, including many Trump voters, who borrowed to purchase their houses. Imagine the reaction of Trump’s friends in real estate. Cuts on the spending side would assuage the deficit hawks. And big cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and National Public Radio are high on the Republican hit list. But the vast majority of federal spending is on entitlements, the military, and other proverbial “third rail” items that elected officials touch at their peril. Simply put, broad-based spending cuts to match broad-based income-tax reductions are not politically feasible. Eliminating federal subsidies for health-insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) would save the government a little over $100 billion a year, about 3 per cent of federal spending. But those subsidies are largely paid for by their own dedicated taxes. Moreover, Trump and congressional Republicans are learning that replacing Obamacare is easier said than done. Health-care reform, as Hillary Clinton could have told them, is fearsomely complex. It is increasingly clear that the name will change (“Trumpcare,” anyone?), and it can be expected that the Republican plan will cover fewer people; but much of the substance will remain the same. Because corporate taxes are less significant in terms of overall federal revenue, rate cutting doesn’t pose a comparable threat to the budget balance. But here there is no agreement between Congress and the Trump administration on the form such cuts should take.House Speaker Paul Ryan and others favor moving to a border adjustment tax that would tax corporate cash flows regardless of where the goods sold by US companies are produced, while exempting exports. Others, such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, are evidently skeptical. And an important part of Trump’s business constituency – import-dependent retailers like Target and Walmart – are actively hostile. Agreement on a plan won’t come easily. Trump’s other flagship proposal is a $1 trillion infrastructure programme. But this initiative will run headlong into deficit concerns, and it is fundamentally at odds with Republican skepticism about big government, and specifically about the public sector’s capacity to carry out investment plans efficiently. Trump will want to be able to point to a few signature projects. He will want his border wall with Mexico. But any new federal infrastructure spending is likely to be more symbolic than real. So what will an impatient president, frustrated and hemmed in on all sides, do? First, Trump will focus on the one set of economic policies a president can pursue without close congressional cooperation, namely those affecting trade. He can invoke the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, restricting imports on the grounds that they threaten US “material interests.” He can invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 on the grounds that the loss of jobs to Mexico and China constitutes an economic emergency. He can even invoke the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 on the grounds that the US has Special Forces active in the Middle East. Second, Trump will respond, as populists do, by attempting to distract attention from his failure to deliver the economic goods. This means directing his ire and that of his supporters toward others – whether internal enemies like the press, the intelligence community, and Barack Obama, or external adversaries like the IS and China. It wouldn’t be the first time a politician used a domestic political crusade or a foreign policy adventure to divert attention from his economic failures. We have already seen Trump’s tendency to lash out at perceived enemies, foreign and domestic. And we know that this confrontational style is the modus operandi of senior White House advisers like Stephen Bannon and Stephen Miller. We can hope that cooler heads prevail. But, given the constraints on implementing Trump’s economic agenda, it’s hard to be optimistic. - Project Syndicate < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

That’s as good an excuse as any to remind the New Jersey business community that companies with more women on their boards wind up with better bottom-line financials. Not to mention diversity of perspective and many other less-tangible assets. Our take: At NJBIZ, we say it over and over: Closing the gender gap in all aspects of business will pay off for your company. So, what’s taking you so long? Pipe dreams? Public Service Electric & Gas announced last week that it would seek to unload its investment in the PennEast natural gas pipeline that will run through Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The utility expects to remain a customer if the pipeline project ever gets done, according to media reports. New Jersey Resources, South Jersey Industries, Southern Co., Spectra Energy Corp. and UGI Corp. are still involved, though. Our take: A lot of talk around pipelines these days, between President Donald Trump pushing ahead the Keystone XL pipeline and the news about this one. PSE&G said the withdrawal is strictly a business decision, however. At least they only invested a little time Walmart announced last week that it is killing a proposal to build a second store in Toms River after 13 — 13! — years of planning, according to NJ Advance Media. A spokesman was quoted as saying the company would continue to expand in New Jersey, just not on that site. The project had faced a battle over zoning. Our take: A tough break for Toms River, in terms of jobs, but the Garden State on the whole should continue to benefit from the retail giant’s continued growth. Each week in Face Time, NJBIZ editors approximate Chris Christie's mood and facial expressions based on the news. FACE TIME: BEATING THE DRUM Gov. Chris Christie spent a lot of time last week traveling around the state to talk about his efforts to combat the state’s opioid crisis. He hosted a summit on giving ex-offenders a chance to reintegrate into the business community and, at another stop on what the Office of the Governor called his “Re-entry Employment Tour,” Christie announced that the Gateway Foundation would provide services when a former prison reopens as a treatment center. QUOTE MARKS “The inescapable fact is that there are simply not enough doctors in the United States to keep pace with demand. Barring international doctors’ entry into our country will only exacerbate this burgeoning health crisis. The impact will be felt most acutely in New Jersey. Our residents are cared for by more foreign-born physicians than any other state in our nation.” — Sister Patricia Codey, president, Catholic HealthCare Partnership of New Jersey, in an “Industry Insights” blog on NJBIZ.com.  More From This Industry • CEO Catino leaving QualCare Alliance Networks • UNUSUAL: N.J. student Alexa Seary can't give you directions, so quit bugging her • U.S.: 2 federal judges rule against Trump’s latest travel ban • REGION: Yuengling again leads the U.S. in craft beer sales Share This Story On: Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn   Leave a Comment Your Name: Validation: Comment: Please note: All comments will be reviewed and may take up to 24 hours to appear on the site.

Subscribe to feed Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ShareEmail  Print You can count billionaire investor Peter Thiel among those who believe globalization is on the decline in the age of Donald Trump and Brexit. Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal and a Trump supporter, said Trump’s victory demonstrated how dissatisfied people have become with a global system that hasn’t worked well for them. “I think the tide on globalization is just going out,” Thiel said in a Tuesday appearance at the CERAWeek by IHS Markit conference in Houston. Ted Malloch, chairman and CEO of the Roosevelt Group and the man believed to be President Trump’s choice for U.S. ambassador to the European Union, said he agrees with Thiel’s take. “He is correct to suggest that the tide is ebbing on globalization as nations move to do more within their own borders,” Malloch, author of “Hired: An Insider’s Look at the Trump Victory,” told WND. “Security becomes a focus. Immigration and free movement of people comes into question. The statistics prove the case and people like New York Times loudmouth and flat-worlder Tom Freidman are just plain wrong and yesterday.” However, Malloch, who spent decades working in the global economy, wished to make a caveat. “Globalization in manufacturing, such as autos, in banking and in IT, especially outsourcing, is down, and maybe for the count, but the ideology of globalism which allows so-called experts and unelected figures to push their agenda on the rest of us is still dominant, even if Brexit and Trump’s election are challenging it,” he clarified. “In fact I would argue it is the culture war of our times.” Malloch said globalization “is a process that failed to deliver.” “Take a drive through western Pennsylvania, Ohio, the North of England and the vacated small cities of Europe and you can see firsthand the result,” he said. “Our jobs were shipped overseas and traded away in bad deals that have economic and societal impacts that will be felt for many decades. It simply wasn’t worth the price. When you build an economy based on cheap imports at Walmart, there comes a time when the people who shop there, regards of everyday low prices, just can’t afford it largely because they have lost their jobs.” At the Houston conference, Thiel said no one in their right mind would start an organization with the word “global” in the title today. To illustrate the way in which global thought has fallen out of favor, he pointed to the annual World Economic Forum held in Davos, Switzerland. “A decade ago, this was a group of people who were running the world,” Thiel said. “And now, it’s just a group of people who messed up the world.” Malloch, who once served on the executive board of the World Economic Forum, said Thiel’s mostly right. “Davos is something I know well and have written about,” Malloch said. “It is more and more a place for has-beens, wannabes and celebrities. I know many CEOs who won’t show their faces there anymore. It has run its course and after all was mostly for show and a gimmick to show how wonderful Switzerland is. It is, I see, according to them, now the number one country in the world!” Want to know why Trump won, what he represents and where he’s going to take the country from here?

Chambers won the Watkins Award on Saturday night in Washington, D.C. (Julie Bennett | jbennett@al.com) By AL.com report on March 12, 2017 8:41 PM comments The National Alliance of African American Athletes on Saturday night presented the 26th annual Franklin D. Watkins Memorial Award trophy to RaKavius Chambers of Opelika High School. The Watkins award is intended to select the nation’s top African-American high school scholar athlete. It puts an emphasis not only on athletic ability but also on academic performance and community service. It is named in honor of Franklin D. Watkins, who coached little league and high school football in Harrisburg, Penn., and dedicated much of his life to helping inner-city youth. Of the six finalists for this year's award, two were from Alabama -- Chambers and Ryan Johnson of St. Paul's. Chambers signed to play football at Duke last month. Johnson signed with Stanford. “RaKavius is one of the finest young men that we have honored,” said Everette Pearsall, executive director of the National Alliance of African American Athletes. “We know that he will be an excellent leader and standard bearer and represent the Watkins Award with class and integrity as he continues his career at Duke. As will all of the finalists as they take the next step in their careers.” Congratulations to Rak Chambers !!! Duke FB signee!! 2017 Watkins Award National winner!!! Great on and off the field!!! — David Cutcliffe (@DavidCutcliffe) March 12, 2017 At Opelika High where he carries a 4.3 grade-point average, Chambers is a member of the National Honor Society, National Science Honor Society, Fellowship of Christian Athletes and the Mu Alpha Theta math honor society. He volunteers for Relay for Life, Boys and Girls Club, Storybook Farm, Darden Head Start and The Big House Foundation. On the field, Chambers is a standout lineman and was named an Offense-Defense All-American. He aspires to be a doctor. Johnson, the Alabama Sports Writers Association Class 5A Lineman of the Year, is a four-year honor student at St. Paul’s in Mobile with a 3.9 GPA. He is a member of the Key Club, Art Club, has volunteered with Habitat for Humanity and Harris Closest-Give Back for Those in Need, and is an usher at New Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church. The other finalists and members of the Watkins Class of 2017 were Justin Foster of Shelby, N.C., who has signed with Clemson University; Donovan Peoples-Jones of Detroit, who has signed with the University of Michigan; Isaiah Pryor of Atlanta, who has signed with Ohio State University; and Connor Wedington of Sumner, Wash., who has signed with Stanford University. The finalists were selected based on their unweighted grade-point average, personal statement, extracurricular activities, community service and letters of recommendation. Sponsors of the event include Major Sponsor Under Armour, JMA Solutions, Peoples Financial Services, Wal-Mart, Dell Inc., Nash Management Group, Early Morning Software and Jostens Corporation, which produces the Watkins Award trophy and rings. Among the Watkins Award Gala’s other honorees, Miami Dolphins linebacker and Watkins Class of 2009 member Jelani Jenkins was named the Watkins Man of the Year, while George Washington University administrator Michael Tapscott was named the Sharon Love Ransom Community Service Award winner. Under Armour executive Eric Ogbogu was the keynote speaker, sharing his message of resiliency and perseverance with the crowd that included several Watkins alumni and current and former NFL players.

In his budget speech, finance minister Arun Jaitley had announced the government's intent to ease foreign direct investment (FDI) rules further but had refrained from naming any sectors in the wake of assembly elections in five states. Sources, however, told TOI that the broad contours of the FDI package have been prepared at the level of bureaucrats and there are two options for the retail sector, which is seen to be a key element of the Narendra Modi government's job creation plan as it heads into the last two years of its five-year term. One option is a limited opening up by allowing food retailers to generate around 20-25% of their sales from non-food items such as kitchen-use products or basic household requirements like toothpaste. The current policy allows 100% FDI in stores that sell only Made-in-India food products or locally produced farm goods. There have been no takers for the food retail business so far as several retailers are waiting for a further opening up. The ministry of food processing was lobbying hard for letting these retailers sell everyday-use products but other government agencies were not on board. Later, however, the department of industrial policy and promotion, the agency that drives FDI policy, agreed to the proposal and has already communicated its backing. The second option is more radical and is seen as an option that will translate into "real opening up" of the multibrand retail business. Sources said the government may look to allow FDI in retail with the rider that only India-made goods would be sold in these stores. This proposal, they said, would be more palatable to retailers as it would give them greater operational flexibility besides providing an arrangement where the entire canvas is available. FDI in retail has been a contentious sector with UPA's move to open up the sector facing stiff resistance from BJP before 2014. In fact, BJP-ruled states had said that they would not allow foreign-owned companies to open stores under the shops and Establishments Act, preventing a rollout of the policy. Since coming to power in 2014, the Modi administration has not reversed the UPA decision but has not endorsed it earlier as none of the global players have sought permission. While Carrefour and Auchan have exited India, Tesco has a tie up with the Tata Group. Walmart is studying its model in some of the Latin American markets to see if it can enter the food retail space but it would be more comfortable if given greater policy elbowroom.

Vanessa Lopez, 23, instructed the children to lie on the floor and hide if anyone came to the door, Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office records state.

The 7-year-old was visibly shaking while speaking with investigators. Florida woman selling wedding ring to pay for husband's medical bills says buyer was thief Florida doesn’t have a set age for when a child can be left home alone and instead “expects parents to take all of the circumstances into account” when deciding whether to leave a child, the state Department of Children and Families says on its website. Only three states — Illinois, Oregon and Maryland — have laws setting a minimum age for children to be home alone. Maryland has the youngest minimum, 8. Lopez was with a 4-year-old child at a school meeting that afternoon. The suburban West Palm Beach woman left shortly before 2:30 p.m. and returned at 3:24 p.m., records show. The home contained food, milk, water and working electricity, records state. However, sheriff’s officials noted a bed in the home did not have sheets and a plastic Walmart bag was in a crib. Officials arrested Lopez on four counts of child neglect. She was released Thursday from the Palm Beach County Jail on a $12,000 surety bail. © 2017 Cox Media Group.
