Her remarks to Congress Thursday suggest that the central bank is on track to raise interest rates at its meeting in December, one month before Trumps takes office. She said she has no plans to step down before her four-year term ends on Feb. 3, 2018, reiterated the Fed’s political independence and vigorously defended tougher bank regulations established in the wake of the financial crisis. An improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising interest rates, Yellen told Congress’ Joint Economic Committee. ___ America’s shift to SUVs is on display at L.A. Auto Show America’s shift from cars to SUVs is starting to look permanent, and automakers are scrambling to meet the demand. Toyota, Ford, Subaru, Jeep and Volkswagen are all showing new SUVs at this week’s Los Angeles Auto Show. Even traditional luxury car makers like Jaguar and Alfa Romeo are debuting SUVs. Americans bought more SUVs than four-door cars for the first time last year, and the momentum is growing. But unlike the previous SUV boom, which fell victim to rising gas prices, this one is likely to stay as automakers offer more small SUVs with better fuel economy. ___ Ex-Valeant, Philidor execs arrested for fraud, conspiracy Former executives of Valeant Pharmaceuticals and a related mail-order pharmacy were charged Thursday with running a fraud-and-kickback scheme that bilked Valeant out of millions of dollars. Their arrests are part of an ongoing investigation, according to Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who said other arrests are possible. Bharara’s office said it has charged Gary Tanner, a former Valeant executive, and Andrew Davenport, who had been the chief executive of Philidor, a mail-order pharmacy that is now defunct, with two counts of wire fraud, along with money laundering and conspiracy. ___ Bank stocks surge again, leading broader market higher NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose Thursday as banks resumed their steep upward climb and retailers moved higher. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen emphasized that the Fed plans to raise interest rates, which will help banks make more money from lending. Stocks started the day with small gains and moved higher following Yellen’s testimony to Congress. Banks once again marched higher as investors cheered the latest indication that interest rates will rise from their current ultra-low levels. Retailers also rose after strong earnings from Best Buy, while food and household goods makers struggled after weak results from Wal-Mart and J.M. Smucker. ___ Wal-Mart’s profit falls but beats estimates; revenue misses NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. saw its third-quarter profit fall more than 8 per cent, dragged down as it continues to plow money into e-commerce and improving its stores. While online sales improved, overall revenue fell short of expectations as the company said it was hurt in part by falling food prices. Profit at the world’s largest retailer still beat Wall Street expectations, and it lifted the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast. Investors focused on the sales, though, sending shares in the retailer down. ___ Gap’s third-quarter profit drops nearly 18 per cent NEW YORK (AP) — Gap’s third-quarter profit fell nearly 18 per cent, undercut by costs related to store closures outside North America. Gap Inc. shares fell in after-market trading Thursday as the company said the slump in the number of people visiting its stores continues as it heads into the critical holiday shopping season. Gap is facing the same problems as other fashion retailers, with shoppers buying less clothing in general and also favouring off-price chains like T.J. Maxx. But Gap is also struggling with identity problems, mired in a slump as its fashions just don’t stand out in an overcrowded landscape. ___ JPMorgan Chase to pay $264 million in Chinese bribery case NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. has agreed to pay $264.4 million in fines to federal authorities to settle criminal and civil charges that it hired friends and relatives of Chinese officials in order to gain access to banking deals in that country. JPMorgan’s Asia affiliate allegedly created a quid pro quo program that would hire the children and friends of high-ranking Chinese officials, regardless of the person’s qualifications, in order to gain favour and win banking deals. ___ Tesla, SolarCity get shareholder approval for merger Tesla Motors got approval from investors to combine with SolarCity Corp. in an effort to expand the market for solar power and give electric car owners new options for solar charging. Shareholders of both companies backed the merger by a wide margin Thursday. The deal, first proposed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk proposed in June, has had more of a mixed reaction on Wall Street. Analysts wondered why Tesla would want to take on SolarCity while busy with its own goals. There were also complaints of a conflict of interest for Musk, who is chairman of both companies. ___ Wells Fargo sees significant slowdown in account openings NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo disclosed signs on Thursday that its customers are significantly pulling back from doing business with the bank, a reverberation of the sales practices scandal that drew a huge fine in September. Because of the timing, its data for October is the first full-picture view of customer reaction and it is not pretty. New customer account openings fell 44 per cent in October from a year earlier, while account closures rose 3 per cent from the previous year. The bank saw a 50 per cent drop in credit card applications. ___ Verizon’s AOL cutting 500 jobs, will focus on mobile, video NEW YORK (AP) — AOL is cutting about 500 jobs, or 8 per cent of its workforce, as it trims back following some deals and focuses on mobile, video and data. In a memo to employees, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong says the Verizon-owned company has added 1,500 employees over the past year because of acquisitions and partnerships, and it needs to consolidate to improve operations. Armstrong says AOL will add jobs in the areas that are driving growth. ___ Sorry Trump, NY Times says subscriptions rose since election NEW YORK (AP) — The New York Times pushed back against President-elect Donald Trump, saying Thursday that its paid subscriptions have jumped since the election, despite Trump’s accusations. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that the Times “is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the ‘Trump phenomena.'” The Times said Thursday that it added 41,000 paid subscriptions to its newspaper and digital news products in the week since Election Day. The increase is its largest one-week rise since 2011, when it launched its digital subscription model. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average added 35.68 points, or 0.2 per cent, to close at 18,903.82. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 10.18 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 2,187.12. The Nasdaq composite added 39.39 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 5,333.97. Benchmark U.S. crude slid 15 cents to $45.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slipped 14 cents to $46.49 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.34 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.45 a gallon. Natural gas fell 6 cents, or 2.2 per cent, to $2.70 per 1,000 cubic feet. ___ The first item has been corrected to read that Yellen’s term ends on Feb. 3, 2018, not January 2018. shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Leave a comment Cancel reply Sign in to comment.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) - A labor union was kept barred from protesting or demonstrating at Wal-Mart’s stores and offices in Arkansas after the state’s highest court on Thursday scaled back a judge’s order prohibiting the group from entering the retail giant’s property for anything other than shopping. The Arkansas Supreme Court upheld a Benton County judge’s trespassing order against the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, but modified the injunction to cover only activities such as picketing, demonstrations and flash mobs against the Bentonville-based company. “We agree with the union that the circuit court’s injunction and declaration encompassing all non-shopping activity or conduct is simply too broad,” the court said in its ruling. The union and its affiliate group, the Organization United for Respect at Wal-Mart, had argued that the National Labor Relations Board, not the Benton County judge, should have jurisdiction over the matter. Justices disagreed and noted that appellate courts in several other states have rejected that argument. “We are pleased at the Arkansas Supreme Court’s decision to narrow the overbroad order,” Randy Parraz, campaign director for the union’s Making Change at Wal-Mart campaign, said in a statement. “Make no mistake, Making Change at Walmart will continue to fight for a better life for the millions of hard-working Walmart employees in every state across this country whose economic struggles have been long forgotten or ignored by Walmart and so many others.” Wal-Mart sued the union over the demonstrations, which it said has included flash mobs where demonstrators have banged on pots and pans and marched and chanted through its stores. Other activities have included rallies and picketing at its stores and offices, the company said. The retail giant has filed similar suits against the union in Florida and Texas in recent years. “We appreciate the court protecting property rights and upholding our right to seek enforcement of the trespass laws against unions in these situations,” Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg said in an email. “As the court’s opinion notes, other states have agreed with this approach.” The union had argued that the company’s trespassing complaint in Arkansas was nearly identical to one it had also filed with the national board. An attorney for Wal-Mart told the court last month that trespassing was a state issue and was properly before the state judge. In a separate opinion, Justice Josephine Linker Hart wrote that she agreed that the original trespassing order was too broad but believed justices should have sent the case back to the lower court rather than rewrite it themselves. “Further, picketing, patrolling, parading, demonstrations, hand-billing and solicitation are all protected activities under the right circumstances,” she wrote. “It behooves this court to return this case to the circuit court where an order that clearly does not run afoul of the National Labor Relations Act can be crafted with the assistance of the litigants.” Filed under: Court, Protest, Union Print Email Gmail Related Supreme Court Rejects Union Challenge to Casino Bankruptcy Arkansas State Student Union Evacuated After Man With Gun Drove Onto Campus State Loses High Court Appeal in Ports Case California Wal-Mart at Center of Labor Dispute to Reopen Wal-Mart Executives Visit Stores for Surprise Promotions Subscribe to the Hamodia print edition More in Business U.K. Treasury Chief: Brexit Uncertainty Could Drag on Economy Wall Street Slips, Led by Healthcare Decline U.S. Stocks Slip as Health Care and Technology Take Losses Volkswagen to Shed 30,000 Jobs, Cutting Costs After Scandal Asian Shares Mixed, Nikkei Up as Yellen Remarks Lift Dollar OP-ED On Seeking Counsel Hillary Clinton Wasn’t The Only Big Election Loser A Common Sense Regulation Where Do We Go From Here?

(CSCO), Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (REGN) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks CSCO, WMT and REGN stock used more than their fair share of red ink on Thursday By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Nov 17, 2016, 4:48 pm EST     Popular Posts: 10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in 2017 The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2016 Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is Just a One-Hit Wonder Recent Posts: Why Gap Inc (GPS), Hibbett Sports, Inc. (HIBB) and First Solar, Inc. (FSLR) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks 5 Retail Stocks That May Not Be Around Next Christmas Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF) Stock Is Beyond All Hope View All Posts It was a stop-and-go effort all session long, but by the time the closing bell rang, the strong housing start data managed to prod stocks meaningfully higher. The S&P 500‘s close of 2,187.12 was 0.47% better than Wednesday’s last trade, and left the index within reach of an all-time high. Thursday wasn’t a fun day for all investors though. Owners of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN), Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) are likely lamenting their results on Thursday. Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Try as he might to get investors focused on the bigger picture rather than last quarter’s results and the near-term revenue outlook, Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins couldn’t stave off the 4.8% hit CSCO shares suffered on Thursday. Last quarter — the company’s first fiscal quarter of the year — Cisco earned 61 cents per share on sales of $12.35 billion. Both numbers topped expectations for income of 59 cents per share and revenue of $12.33 billion. But, the top line fell 2.6% on a year-over-year basis, and the company warned CSCO shareholders that sales would likely fall between 2% and 4% for the quarter currently underway. Robbins explained the company’s transition to a service and software company was a more important consideration for CSCO owners, as that would provide more stable revenue. Investors aren’t entirely convinced the transition is going to be an easy one, however. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) Had Walmart managed to top revenue expectations and missed earnings, investors may have let it slide. With WMT topping revenue and missing sales estimates though, Walmart owners revolted. 7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Are Due for a Reckoning For its third fiscal quarter of 2017, WMT earned 98 cents per share on $118.2 billion. The pros were only calling for a bottom line of 96 cents per share of Walmart, but were also expecting revenue of $118.8 billion. Income isn’t a chief concern for shareholders right now, who understand that Walmart is investing in future growth. With the revenue miss though — in addition to its dialed-back Q3 guidance — investors may be feeling WMT isn’t getting much traction on its competitive efforts Still, e-commerce was a bright spot, and that’s a crucial part of the retailer’s revitalization plan. Digital sales were up nearly 21%. Observers cheered Walmart’s willingness and ability to take on rival Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), but not enough to sidestep the stock’s 3% setback on Thursday. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (REGN) Last but not least, bio pharma company Regeneron Pharmaceuticals watched its stock pull back to the tune of 3.7% today following last night’s news that it and Sanofi SA (ADR) (NYSE:SNY) did not stop a trial of cholesterol-fighting drug Praluent in one of its current studies. It sounds a bit counterintuitive for REGN without the right context, but there’s a rational to the response. There had been some previous chatter that the trial was going so well and demonstrating so much efficacy that the companies wouldn’t even need to complete it as initially described in the trial’s plans. Rather, it would simply take the data it had and present that to the Food and Drug Administration as a completed trial. That’s not going to happen now, however. Rather, REGN and SNY are going to see it through to the end. Investors broadly interpreted that decision as a sign that the drug’s efficacy may not be as wildly superior as once expected. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Election lessons learned RDrop in grocery prices hurts Wal-Mal profit margins Chain did see gain on online sales after buying Jet.com Video Photo Bloomberg A Wal-Mart tractor trailer truck departs the company’s distribution center in Washington, Utah. By Shannon Pettypiece, Bloomberg News Nov 17, 2016 at 3:17 pm | Print View Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s brick-and-mortar sales fell short of expectations last quarter, even as its acquisition of internet start-up Jet.com gave a much-needed jolt to e-commerce orders. Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.2 percent in the third quarter, the company said in a statement Thursday. That was just shy of the 1.3 percent predicted by analysts and marked a slowdown from the previous quarter. Total revenue also missed estimates, hurt in part by currency headwinds. The sluggish sales raised concerns for investors, despite Wal-Mart coming through on its pledge to energize its e-commerce business. Wal-Mart’s $3 billion purchase of Jet.com in September helped fuel a 21 percent gain in online sales last quarter, an acceleration from the 12 percent gain in the second quarter. But at its physical stores, a historic streak of food deflation put pressure on the chain. Grocery prices across the country have dropped on a year-over-year basis for 10 straight months, a streak of deflation not seen since 1960. That’s been good for consumers, but it’s brought headaches to Wal-Mart, the largest seller of groceries in the United States. Eggs and beef have grown especially cheap, making competition fiercer between supermarkets. The run of deflation has squeezed profit margins and sent shares of some low-cost chains tumbling. “We are not satisfied,” CEO Doug McMillon said in the statement. “We will continue to change and pick up speed to reach our longer-term aspirations.” Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said it is too early to tell how the incoming Donald Trump administration will affect its business. The president-elect’s pledge to renegotiate trade deals with Mexico and China could have a major impact on Wal-Mart, which imports many of its products from China and has a large business in Mexico. Since taking the helm in 2014, McMillon has boosted pay for U.S. workers, tried to improve Wal-Mart’s grocery quality and spent billions on its online operations — aiming to gain ground on Amazon.com Inc. He also is pushing to lower Wal-Mart’s prices, clean up stores and take better care of customers. Your next Nation & World articles Zuckerberg offers plan for Facebook to f ...

(AP) — A labor union was kept barred from protesting or demonstrating at Wal-Mart's stores and offices in Arkansas after the state's highest court on Thursday scaled back a judge's order prohibiting the group from entering the retail giant's property for anything other than shopping. The Arkansas Supreme Court upheld a Benton County judge's trespassing order against the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, but modified the injunction to cover only activities such as picketing, demonstrations and flash mobs against the Bentonville-based company. "We agree with the union that the circuit court's injunction and declaration encompassing all non-shopping activity or conduct is simply too broad," the court said in its ruling. Story continues below video × The union and its affiliate group, the Organization United for Respect at Wal-Mart, had argued that the National Labor Relations Board, not the Benton County judge, should have jurisdiction over the matter. Justices disagreed and noted that appellate courts in several other states have rejected that argument. "We are pleased at the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision to narrow the overbroad order," Randy Parraz, campaign director for the union's Making Change at Wal-Mart campaign, said in a statement. "Make no mistake, Making Change at Walmart will continue to fight for a better life for the millions of hard-working Walmart employees in every state across this country whose economic struggles have been long forgotten or ignored by Walmart and so many others." Wal-Mart sued the union over the demonstrations, which it said has included flash mobs where demonstrators have banged on pots and pans and marched and chanted through its stores. Other activities have included rallies and picketing at its stores and offices, the company said. The retail giant has filed similar suits against the union in Florida and Texas in recent years. "We appreciate the court protecting property rights and upholding our right to seek enforcement of the trespass laws against unions in these situations," Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg said in an email. "As the court's opinion notes, other states have agreed with this approach." The union had argued that the company's trespassing complaint in Arkansas was nearly identical to one it had also filed with the national board. An attorney for Wal-Mart told the court last month that trespassing was a state issue and was properly before the state judge. In a separate opinion, Justice Josephine Linker Hart wrote that she agreed that the original trespassing order was too broad but believed justices should have sent the case back to the lower court rather than rewrite it themselves. "Further, picketing, patrolling, parading, demonstrations, hand-billing and solicitation are all protected activities under the right circumstances," she wrote. "It behooves this court to return this case to the circuit court where an order that clearly does not run afoul of the National Labor Relations Act can be crafted with the assistance of the litigants." ___ Follow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ademillo Tags Business General News Labor Issues Social Issues Social Affairs Industry Regulation Government Business And Finance Government And Politics Government Regulations Protests And Demonstrations Legal Proceedings Law And Order Political And Civil Unrest Courts Judiciary Local Governments State Governments Locations Arkansas United States North America loading...

Asit Sharma (TMFfinosus) Nov 17, 2016 at 3:20PM Grocery-aisle pricing pressured Wal-Mart's fiscal third-quarter 2017 results. Image source: Getty Images. Macroeconomic trends are starting to get a few hooks into the performance of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT). The global retail and grocery behemoth reported a rather static top-line result in fiscal third-quarter 2017 earnings, released Thursday before the markets opened. After reviewing the report's key raw numbers, we'll examine why economic conditions constrained the company's fiscal third quarter. Wal-Mart results: The raw numbers Metric Q3 2017 Q3 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $118.2 billion $117.4 billion 0.7% Net income from continuing operations $3.03 billion $3.3 billion (8.1)% Diluted EPS $0.98 $1.03 8% Data source: Wal-Mart Stores 8-K filing. What happened with Wal-Mart this quarter? The very slight improvement in total revenue was a function of lighter-than-expected Wal-Mart U.S. sales growth of 2.5%, to $74.6 billion. Wal-Mart U.S. recorded a comparable-sales increase of just 1.7%, which management attributed to the impact of grocery deflation. The macroeconomic trend of deflation may persist in coming quarters. Excess farming supply of dairy, meat, and vegetables, combined with a strong U.S. dollar (which curbs U.S. food export demand), has resulted in lower basic food-commodities costs for grocery chains this year. Yet grocers tend to competitively lower their retail prices in these environments in an attempt to grab market share. Passing on price savings is splendid for customers, but the discounting crimps recorded sales, as Wal-Mart demonstrated this quarter. Wal-Mart's smaller-format Neighborhood Market stores, which are one-fifth the size of a typical supercenter, booked a healthy comparative sales increase of 5.2%. While Wal-Mart International's recorded revenue fell nearly 5%, to $28.4 billion, the international segment achieved growth of 2.4% after adjusting for currency effects. Wage increases, investments in technology, and currency translation pushed operating income down 10.4%. The company pointed out that after adjusting for a one-time lease accounting benefit last year, the comparable operating-income drop was closer to 8%. Wal-Mart's e-commerce business continued to post rapid growth, as online sales surged 20.6%. The company has recently directed substantial resources to pushing its non-brick-and-mortar revenue forward. For example, Wal-Mart closed its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com during the quarter, on Sept. 16. Sam's Club revenue increased just 1.1% to $14.2 billion. Again, management cited grocery deflation as a limiting factor on sales growth. What management had to say CEO Doug McMillon touched on a few significant business trends in the company's quarterly 8-K filing: We had a solid third quarter. Our e-commerce growth accelerated, operations in the U.S. continued to strengthen and international delivered another solid performance. We are pleased that we can see real progress stemming from our strategic choices and we appreciate the great work by our associates. Yet, we are not satisfied. We will continue to change and pick up speed to reach our longer term aspirations. We're positioned well for this important fourth quarter and wish everyone a happy, peaceful and prosperous holiday season. There are a few specific takeaways to unpack in this seemingly general statement. McMillon implicitly refers to the international segment's currency-adjusted growth. On a currency-neutral basis, global operations grew faster than those in the U.S. this quarter. He also obliquely applauds the wage increases the company has undertaken ("strategic choices"), and their positive effects on employees. Finally, McMillon signals that the company feels optimistic about its traditional targeted slate of shopping deals for the upcoming holiday period. And of course, a prosperous holiday season for consumers will translate into a prosperous fiscal fourth quarter for Wal-Mart. Moving forward Wal-Mart raised its full fiscal-year earnings guidance in Thursday's release. Management now expects 2017 earnings per share to fall between $4.34 and $4.49, versus a previous projection of between $4.29 and $4.49. Executives also boosted adjusted earnings per share slightly, from a previous band of between $4.15 and $4.35, to a new range of $4.20 to $4.35. As it looks to close out an eventful year, Wal-Mart is highlighting its progress on optimizing working capital. By lengthening accounts payable days (i.e., slowing vendor payments), controlling receivables collections, and cycling inventory faster, the company has improved operating and free cash flow considerably so far this year: Image source: Wal-Mart Stores investor presentation. The table above shows a substantial year-to-date increase of $4.6 billion in operating cash flow, or about 31% higher cash from operations versus the prior-year period. A slight decrease in capital expenditure has pushed year-to-date free cash flow to $5.4 billion. Wal-Mart has put its cash excess to work by more than tripling share repurchases this year, to $6.3 billion in the first nine months of 2016. This generation of handsome cash flow will likely remain one of management's talking points, as it attempts to spur sales momentum at the outset of a new fiscal year.

Asian shares mixed, Nikkei up as Yellen remarks lift dollar Marley Jay / The Associated Press November 17, 2016 09:37 AM HONG KONG - Japanese shares rose Friday on the yen's weakness while other Asian benchmarks wobbled after Fed chair Janet Yellen signalled that policymakers intend to raise interest rates soon. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.8 per cent to 18,011.79 as the yen hit a six-month low, helping shares of the country's big exporters. South Korea's Kospi shed 0.4 per cent to 1,972.64 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.3 per cent to 22,318.47. The Shanghai Composite slipped 0.1 per cent to 3,206.64 while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 crept up 0.2 per cent to 5,347.30. Benchmarks in Taiwan and Indonesia fell while Singapore's rose. RATE HORIZON: In remarks to Congress, Yellen suggested the U.S. central bank is on track to raise interest rates when policymakers hold their final meeting of the year in December. She said the improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising rates, in comments that increased certainty for investors. The Fed raised its key interest rate in December 2015 but it's still at ultralow levels that have fueled a multiyear global stock market boom. Economists forecast rates will go up by a quarter-point in December followed by two more hikes in 2017. MARKET INSIGHT: "The greatest uncertainties, namely the election and the Fed rate hike, were significantly reduced over the last two weeks, which gave the market a good reason to refocus on the fundamentals of economic and corporate earnings," said Margaret Yang, an analyst at CMC Markets. CURRENCIES: The greenback rallied on the prospect of U.S. higher interest rates. The dollar climbed to 110.60 yen — its highest since the end of May — from 110.17 yen in late trading Thursday. The euro fell to its lowest in nearly a year, sinking to $1.0597 from $1.0614. WALL STREET: The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.2 per cent to 18,903.82. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.5 per cent to 2,187.12. The Nasdaq composite added 0.7 per cent to 5,333.97. ENERGY: Oil extended its decline. Benchmark U.S. crude futures slid 54 cents to $44.88 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 15 cents to settle at $45.42 a barrel on Thursday. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slipped 43 cents to $46.69 a barrel in London. © Copyright Times Colonist Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

About 20,000 people, or a fifth of the workforce at the company’s 400-plus stores in China, have joined groups on WeChat to organise protests against the retailer. PHOTO: THE NEW YORK TIMES mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 4:00 AM, November 18, 2016 SHENZHEN — In a one-man war room in his apartment, a laid-off Walmart employee named Wang Shishu was tapping out a message on his phone to a group of workers and plotting his next move. During the past few months, Mr Wang, 56, has helped organise a national movement in China against Walmart. Labour strikes have hit stores in the south simultaneously. There have been boycotts in the north-east. And, in Shenzhen, where Walmart opened its first outlet in China two decades ago, employees have filed a lawsuit demanding back pay. “We want a snowball effect,” said Mr Wang in the booming baritone of a street preacher. “We want everybody to know what to do next.” As the Chinese economy has slowed, strikes and labour protests have broken out across the country, mostly scattered episodes targeting a single factory or business. The government has responded aggressively, detaining activists and increasing censorship to keep unrest from spreading. But activism against Walmart’s more than 400 stores in China in recent months has followed a different pattern: Workers in several cities agitating against the same company, bypassing official unions controlled by the Communist Party and using social media to coordinate their actions — while the authorities largely stand aside. Across China, Walmart employees have raised their fists at protests, chanting: “Workers, stand up!” They have appealed to local officials with patriotic fervour, invoking the struggles of Mao Zedong against foreign imperialists. They have posted screeds online against unkind bosses and “union puppets”. In doing so, the Chinese workforce of the world’s largest retail chain has put the ruling Communist Party in an uncomfortable position, publicly testing its Marxist commitment to defend the working class and pitting that against its fear of independent labour activism. Ever since the Solidarity trade union helped topple communist rule in Poland, Beijing has sought to prevent the emergence of a nationwide labour movement, suppressing efforts by workers to organise across industries or localities. But the authorities appear to be hesitating in the case of Walmart, whose workers have complained of low wages and a new scheduling system they say has left them poorer and exhausted. In recent months, as many as 20,000 people, about a fifth of the company’s work force in China, have joined messaging groups set up by Mr Wang and other activists on WeChat, a popular app. In these forums, they vent about company policies, share protest slogans and discuss plans to coordinate demonstrations for maximum effect. Mr Wang, a former customer service representative, who Walmart has fired twice, spends his days babysitting his granddaughter and trading messages with workers across the country, often as late as 2am. “What they’re doing is inhumane,” he said. “I want Walmart to return to the sympathetic company it used to be.” Mr Eli Friedman, a labour scholar at Cornell University, said the Walmart movement was “probably the most substantive example of sustained, cross-workplace, independent worker organising we’ve ever seen in China’s private sector”. The government appears to be keeping a distance because it is worried about provoking a backlash, or about acting on behalf of a prominent American company against Chinese workers at a time when nationalism in China is rising. But by doing little, or nothing, it risks encouraging disaffected workers elsewhere, especially at the growing number of national chain businesses with operations across China. Already, workers at Neutrogena stores and China Unicom, a state-owned telecom operator, have used similar tactics, while avoiding serious punishment. “We can only expect that online organising will continue to break down local barriers,” said Mr Keegan Elmer, a researcher for China Labour Bulletin, an advocacy group based in Hong Kong. Chinese law requires businesses to establish labour unions, but they are almost always controlled by management, and companies generally use the unions to contain worker activism. In the face of labour strife, some businesses have offered back pay, bonuses and other benefits to workers. But others, concerned that labour activism could force costly concessions, have resorted to tougher tactics, retaliating against those who help organise protests. At Walmart, some of the most vocal workers have been deprived of raises, reassigned, or in some cases fired, according to interviews with more than a dozen employees. Much of the discontent stems from a new scheduling system that Walmart put in place this summer. The company says the system is a way of giving workers more flexibility. Workers have argued that it has resulted in cuts to overtime pay and excessively long shifts, and some say they were coerced into signing new contracts agreeing to the system. Walmart denied that it had treated its employees unfairly or had pressured them to accept the new schedules. Ms Rebecca Lui, a spokeswoman, said the vast majority of its workforce supported the new system, and that employees were free to keep their old schedules. “Our associates are our most valuable asset,” she said in a statement. Ms Zhai Xiuhua, a former greeter at a Walmart store in Shenzhen, said she was fired in September after leading a fight against the new scheduling system. “I told them, ‘Even if you put a knife to my neck, I’ll never agree’,” she recalled at her home, where her uniform and identification badge — No 14470 — still hang on the wall. Ms Zhai, who is worried about medical bills, says she now hopes to find work in her hometown in the south-western province of Sichuan. Walmart, which has resisted unionisation at its thousands of stores across the world, was forced by the government in 2006 to establish branches of the Communist Party-controlled All-China Federation of Trade Unions for its roughly 100,000 Chinese employees, part of a broader push by the party to unionise foreign businesses. But union branches at many Walmart stores are under the thumb of store managers, and higher-level union officials appear torn about how to respond to complaints from workers such as Ms Zhai. Labour activists at Walmart have cited the ideals of President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party’s history of protecting workers, and experts said they appeared to be benefiting from a belief among some officials that the influence of foreign companies such as Walmart should be curtailed. “If the Chinese authorities try to suppress the workers on behalf of Walmart,” said Mr Wang Jiangsong, a Chinese labour scholar, “it will hurt the country’s image.” When Walmart opened its first store in China in 1996, workers rushed to snap up jobs that paid more than those at Chinese competitors. Now, some employees say, a Walmart job does not pay enough to comfortably support a family, with wages hovering around the minimum wage, or about US$300 (S$425) a month. While Walmart has led a high-profile campaign in the United States to raise pay, salaries in China have remained largely stagnant, said workers, barely keeping pace with inflation. Walmart has struggled to keep up with the fast-changing tastes of Chinese consumers and tried to re-energise its business by making investments in online retailers. But the continuing labour unrest poses a potential hurdle. Ms You Tianyu, 45, a customer service employee at a Walmart store in Shenzhen, caught the attention of her supervisors in August when she wrote a letter to the president of Walmart, Mr Doug McMillon, to complain about the company’s efforts to silence aggrieved workers. Ms You said her bosses now harassed her daily because she spoke out, and she has received a diagnosis of anxiety and depression. She spends most of her non-working hours rummaging through a mess of worker manifestoes, union laws and pay slips in her tiny apartment, hoping to find a new line of attack against Walmart. “I’m on the verge of collapsing,” she said. “I don’t know how much longer I’ll last.” THE NEW YORK TIMES mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most World READ COMMENTED ‘Zombie’ birds fall from sky in Moscow ‘You’re fat’ card prompts London police action ‘Wrong way down the highway’ driver arrested after US crash that killed six ‘Worse than loan sharks’, Pua says of 1MDB paying US$993m for US$3.5b bond guarantee ‘World’s longest flight’ lands in Auckland ‘Post-truth’ named Oxford Dictionaries word of the year Zimbabwean anti-government activists shot at, beaten, abducted Yemeni government says not interested in Kerry's truce announcement Yemen's Houthis say they want to end war, form unity government Yemen air strike kills 14 in attack on fuel trucks: medics, residents Wounded, hungry, determined to stay: life in the line of fire in Mosul World leaders must heed people’s economic fears: Obama Workers laying roads in southern India rescued from debt bondage With Trump win, China looks to seize Asia free trade leadership WHO declares end of Zika emergency but says virus remains a threat Inside Today World Italy's Renzi gets backing in referendum from singers, athletes, chef Obama and Putin speak at APEC summit in Lima Three bombs explode at supermarket in Yangon, no dead or injured French conservatives choose candidate for 2017 presidential election Mali's local elections marred by boycotts, kidnapping Business Deutsche clears chairman of blame for bank's poor cooperation in Libor case: paper Volkswagen CEO says sees case for building own battery factory: paper China pledges further opening as leaders scramble for free trade New Zealand's Key says China will fill trade void left by U.S. Hong Kong firms in China charm-push ahead of Hong Kong-Shenzhen investment link Sports Singapore wants to drop F1 race, says Ecclestone Hafiz pays tribute to S’pore team-mates after seeing red Why We Run: Banker braving extremes to challenge his limits Suzuki Cup: Backs to the wall, Lions defy odds to earn point Schooling stars as Team Singapore athletes enjoy day out at Istana Entertainment Monroe’s ‘Happy Birthday Mr. President’ gown sold for almost S$7m Bollywood actress Mallika Sherawat attacked in Paris Five reasons why you should watch Legend Of The Blue Sea Got a film idea to share with Eric Khoo or Kelvin Tong?

Sports Photos Faces in Places Arts Around The Area People In Society Spotlight on Wicomico Social Lounge Beefed Up Shopping Patrol Turned Down By County Nov 17,2016 by Charlene Sharpe SNOW HILL – Deputies from the Worcester County Sheriff’s Department will not be providing extra patrols at Walmart this holiday season following a recent decision by county leaders. On Tuesday the Worcester County Commissioners voted 5-2 against approving a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that would have allowed deputies to perform extra patrols at Walmart on Black Friday and Christmas. “I’ve been on the record as not in favor of any MOUs with anybody,” Commissioner Jim Bunting said. “I don’t think our sheriff’s department should be security.” Lieutenant Mark Bowen approached the commissioners seeking approval of the MOU, which outlined the time periods the extra patrols would occur, the rate Walmart would pay and the fact that the deputies would be on-duty and under the supervision of the sheriff during that time. Bowen said Walmart would be charged $75 per hour per deputy, as that was the rate that had been set by the county. Commissioner Joe Mitrecic questioned whether $75 an hour would cover the cost, considering deputies were paid overtime on holidays. “I want to make sure we’re not going to be double-paying and only charge time-and-a-half to Walmart,” he said. Stacey Norton, the county’s human resources director, explained that the deputies who did the work would be given alternate days off to make up for working on the holidays and therefore would be paid the regular overtime rate. Commissioner Chip Bertino asked who would be performing the patrols. Bowen explained the task would be given to whoever volunteered for it. “Everybody has a fair chance,” he said. “Nobody’s forced to do it. It’s all volunteer.” Bertino also wanted to know whether the sheriff’s department performed this type of work for other area businesses. Bowen said they were free to ask. “We’ve done Walmart in the past and they liked the service,” he said. Commissioner Ted Elder asked whether the $75 rate would cover the cost of overtime if a member of the command staff volunteered. “I don’t foresee anybody in the command staff signing up to work at Walmart,” Bowen said. Bunting pointed out that the sheriff’s department had road patrols out every day of the year. He asked whether they could simply circle the Walmart parking lot during their normal patrols. Bowen said Walmart officials specifically wanted to have a deputy there. “I think there are too many questions here,” Mitrecic said. Commissioners Diana Purnell and Bud Church were the only two to vote in support of the MOU. ← Previous Next → 0 shares0000 About The Author: Charlene Sharpe Charlene Sharpe has been with The Dispatch since 2014.

But in the battle between Walmart and Visa, nuances are few and far between. Visa is offering $10 to anyone in Manitoba who buys groceries using their Visa card. Walmart stopped accepting Visa as of Oct. 24 in the province. So the credit card company wants to hit the retail giant where it hurts most: food retailing. Walmart intends to become the No. 1 food retailer in Canada, as it is in the U.S. But the Canadian food distribution landscape is much different. Just three major companies feed most Canadians: Loblaws, Sobeys and Metro. So this may take a while. Walmart and Costco have made great strides in the marketplace in recent years. The companies have a combined market share of nearly 20 per cent. Walmart capitalized on Target’s abrupt retreat from Canada to strengthen, particularly in Quebec and British Columbia. Nurturing food shopping habits is at the core of Walmart’s insurgence. In fact, it’s successfully converting same-store sales into more food purchases. Walmart works because it uses analytics to support of its impressive logistical capacity, making margins much easier to control. That’s where Visa comes in. Earlier this year, Walmart vowed to stop accepting Visa at its more than 400 Canadian outlets because it believed Visa’s transaction fees were too high. At last report, however, Walmart has only implemented its Visa ban in Manitoba and Thunder Bay, Ont., and sales results in the wake of the ban have been discouraging. Nevertheless, Walmart apparently intends to continue to bully the credit card company. Visa, meanwhile, is casting itself as a protector of consumers and is encouraging them to support retailers who accept Visa. It doesn’t mention Walmart in its Manitoba campaign, but we all know what this is about. And Visa picked food, of all products, as its campaign focus. That’s telling. Visa, too, is a data-driven enterprise. And it needs the vast market information from card use at Walmart stores to get a comprehensive sense of the marketplace. Walmart’s boycott of Visa hurts the credit card company’s bottom line and denies it access to massive market data that’s critical to its ability to operate. Walmart has enough power to re-channel how consumers use credit to buy almost anything. But converting consumers to other credit sources will take time, so Walmart is going slow in pushing Visa out of its stores. Banks, which are heavily invested in the credit card business, stand to lose millions if these two companies part ways. That’s not a scenario Visa wants to think about. Worse, if Walmart wins and gets to pay lower transaction fees to credit card suppliers, Loblaws, Sobeys and Metro will likely ask for similar fee reductions. Other smaller retailers will follow suit. So it’s not surprising to see how Visa has responded to Walmart’s boycott, since the stakes are huge. Food industry battles aren’t new. But Visa bribing consumers so they make food purchases anywhere but at Walmart is likely a first in Canada. And certainly Walmart is not without fault. But the company has been successful because it understands the data game. The end result could be a change in how credit is used to buy food and how grocers support customers looking for more loyalty rewards. Walmart is making the normally obscure credit world very public. And Visa is making a political statement. Consumers who use credit cards to purchase food either want extra goodies beyond what retailers provide or, regrettably, lack other financial options. Visa is desperately trying to use both circumstances to its advantage. Certainly the battle lacks subtlety. That probably means the company with the most clout – Walmart – will be the winner.

He his accused of exposing himself and performing a lewd act in front of a woman in the parking lot (Courtesy: Troy Police Department). TROY, Ohio (WDTN) – A Harrison Township firefighter is charged with performing a lewd act on himself in the Troy Walmart parking lot. On Nov. 7, a woman was in the parking lot of Walmart when she saw a silver Chevy Impala, whose driver is later identified as Keith Bousquette, pull into a parking space near her — one space away, according to a Troy Police report. The woman saw Bousquette expose and perform a sex act on himself while parked next to the woman, who was sitting in her vehicle. The woman took a picture of Bousquette’s vehicle near her — not of the act — and sent it to her husband, who later came to the Walmart parking lot. When the woman’s husband arrived, that’s when Bousquette drove away and took the interstate, according to the report. Police were able to make contact with Bousquette who told them that he thought the woman in the vehicle was someone he knew and “exposed himself as a joke” but it “turned out that it was not” his friend, according to the police report. Bousquette is listed as a firefighter on the Harrison Township Fire Department’s website as a firefighter and paramedic who has been with the department since Jan. 22, 2008. He is expected to appear in court at 8 a.m. Nov. 22. Share this: Tweet Email Print More Share on Tumblr Like this: Like Loading...

Jim Cramer Rhonda Schaffler Nov 17, 2016 1:20 PM EST Walmart's ( WMT)  earnings report shouldn't surprise investors, said the TheStreet's Jim Cramer. The company's CEO has already explained that this year the focus is on investment, Cramer noted. Cramer said he is giving the retailer a pass on its latest earnings report. He thinks Walmart's recent acquisition of Jet.com will help it better compete against Amazon ( AMZN) . In its latest quarter, Walmart reported a drop in profits, and revenue gains were less than some on Wall Street expected.

DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today Walmart (WMT) Delivers 'Okay' Q3 Results, Raymond James' Bugatch Says Walmart (WMT) reported an earnings beat and revenue miss for the 2017 third quarter this morning. Natalie Walters Nov 17, 2016 1:12 PM EST NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Walmart  (WMT) were lower in early afternoon trading Thursday, after the discount superstore reported a revenue miss for the 2017 third quarter before today's opening bell.  Walmart's quarterly revenue rose by 0.7% year-over-year to $118.2 billion, but missed expectations of $118.8 billion. Earnings came in at 98 cents per share, topping estimates for 96 cents per share.  "I think the quarter was an okay quarter," Raymond James managing director Budd Bugatch said on BloombergTV's "Bloomberg Daybreak: Americas" today. The firm has a "buy" rating and $80 price target on the stock.  Walmart is clearly still trying to improve the customer experience in its stores and to accelerate its e-commerce business, he noted. "The results tell you that strategy is intact."  For the stock to make a U-turn and go up, Walmart would have needed to report better same-store sales, Bugatch noted. Walmart's same-store sales increased by 1.2% year-over-year, vs. estimates for a 1.3% increase. "That's the disappointment this morning." In order to know that Walmart is improving the customer experience in its stores, you have to look at the "numbers of the inventory," he said. "Inventory was actually down. Comp inventory in the U.S. was down, yet in-stock was up. And that's kind of what you look at." Walmart agreed to purchase e-commerce giant Jet.com in August for $3.3. billion, but it's "much too early" to say whether that deal is working or not, Bugatch commented.   Separately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its "risk-adjusted" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author.

 How Target, Walmart, and Amazon are facing the ultimate challenge on the biggest shopping days of the year Hayley Peterson Nov. 17, 2016, 1:09 PM 3,664 facebook linkedin twitter email print REUTERS/Jonathan Alcorn Retailers spend all year gearing up for this moment: the launch of the all-important holiday shopping season. The months of November and December are the most critical time of the year in retail, accounting for as much as 30% of annual sales for many retailers, according to the National Retail Federation. Shoppers are expected to spend $655.8 billion in the two-month period this year, an 3.6% increase over last year's spending, according to the NRF. Online sales are forecast to grow between 7% and 10% over last year to as much as $117 billion. That means a website glitch — even if it lasts only a couple minutes — or running out of stock on a popular item can cost companies millions of dollars in lost sales. For that reason, retailers work hard all year long to get the holidays right. For Walmart, Target, and Amazon, that has meant overhauling websites and shopping apps, speeding up shipping, and using predictive analytics to try and determine the right amount of product to stock up on for the busy holiday season. Target last year broke a record in online sales on Thanksgiving, so it has been focused over the last year on ensuring that its website works seamlessly during the high-traffic holiday period. Target The company says it has made "dramatic" changes to Target.com to speed up the checkout process and to make it function more fluidly across desktop computers, tablets, and smart phones. It also widened its toy selection by 15% over last year, since the holiday season accounts for 50% of Target's toy sales. "We’ve made back-end platform changes that are designed to enhance day-to-day functionality — from account management to checkout — and build more capacity and flexibility as we head into the holiday season," Target spokesman Eddie Baeb said. The company has also made significant changes to speed up shipping for online orders. Specifically, Target doubled the number of stores that are able to ship orders, bringing the total number of shipping-enabled stores to 1,000 out of Target's 1,800 locations nationwide. With this change, Target's stores are now expected to fulfill more than half of the retailer's holiday orders, executives said. Thanksgiving Day holiday shoppers line up with television sets on discount at the Target retail store in Chicago, Illinois, November 28, 2013. REUTERS/Jeff Haynes This not only cuts down on shipping times for customers, but it also reduces costs for Target because the packages don't have to travel as far. "With this increase, Target will be able to fulfill more orders, spread workload and improve average ship times during the holidays," Baeb said. Walmart meanwhile has been heavily focused on expanding the breadth of products it offers online. The company has more than doubled its online assortment to 20 million products since last year, and "millions of additional items are scheduled to be added in the coming months," the company said. To prevent customers from getting overwhelmed by all the new products, Walmart made improvements to its "recommendation engine," which so far has led to a 20% increase in customer engagement with  items the website recommends.  It has also built a new software called Electrode that helps its web pages load 33% faster, according to Walmart. AP But Walmart doesn't just want its website to be fast: it needs to prevent crashes, as well. The company says it expects about 10 times its normal traffic rates on Walmart.com from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday. So the retailer built software called OneOps that makes it possible to handle peak traffic on Walmart.com across several clouds — versus a single cloud — to avoid downtime on the site. To make sure it works properly, Walmart has been stress-testing the website in the last several weeks by hitting it with traffic that well exceeds expectations during the holidays. Walmart is also trying to cut down on shipping times this year after doubling  its number of online fulfillment centers — which are responsible for packing and shipping online orders — from five warehouses last year to 10 this year.  Customers can also choose to pick up online orders in stores. Last year, the company received up to five times as many same-day pickup orders during the holiday period compared to a normal week. So Walmart is staffing up its store teams responsible for helping customers with online pickup, and for the first time, adding dedicated "pickup" managers to every store. Amazon has also been adding to its staff to handle holiday demand. The retailer this year hired 120,000 temporary workers for the holidays, up 20% from the 100,000 workers it hired during the period last year. Amazon's holiday preparation this year has also been focused on improving its mobile app to make shopping and in-store price comparisons easier.  An Amazon warehouse.

The app is also offering a tool again this year called "watch a deal" that alerts shoppers to specific holiday deals whenever they become available. According to the company, seven in 10 Amazon customers shopped using a mobile device last holiday season. As Target, Walmart, Amazon, and others prepare for the rush holiday orders, delivery companies are readying for an influx in packages. The United States Postal Service is expected to deliver 750 million packages this holiday season, or 5 million packages per day – a 12% increase from the 670 million delivered during the period last year. The United Parcel Service will ship another 700 million packages over the same period, which is a 16% increase from the previous year.

Ahold Delhaize, the Dutch-Belgian retailer that runs U.S. supermarket chains Stop & Shop, Giant, Hannaford and Food Lion, among others, earlier reported a 4.3 percent rise in third-quarter underlying operating income, to 513 million euros ($549 million) but missed analyst expectations due to its U.S. performance. CEO Dick Boer said in an interview that the stores most feeling the pinch were its Food Lion shops, of which there are 1,100 situated in Southern U.S. states. "During the second and third quarter, there was aggressive pricing from Wal-Mart, it's well known in the market, and of course we had to follow to keep our competitive position," he said. For several years, Food Lion has been cutting prices, emphasizing fresh produce and remodelling stores to make them easier for customers to navigate and find on-sale items. Boer noted that despite price deflation of nearly 1.5 percent in the areas where Food Lion, the core of Delhaize's U.S. business, competes, the chain had grown sales by 1.3 percent in the past recent quarter, which he said was evidence of its resilience. The division's growth on a like for like basis however was down from 1.6 percent in the same period a year ago, and operating margins fell to 3.5 percent from 3.8 percent. Boer said Ahold Delhaize is keenly aware of the ongoing U.S. expansion of German retailer Aldi, and plans by another German discount chain, Lidl, to open stores on the U.S. East Coast. "For sure, every competitor coming into a market is, for us, and for everyone I think, a signal to be more alert than before," he said. "Aldi is known in the markets, clearly we have seen them continue to grow in the markets where we operate." He cited the Philadelphia area as an example. "So that's what drives also I think the actions of Wal-Mart in the Southern states, to be sure that with the discounters coming in that Wal-Mart still keeps its price leadership," Boer said. "I think that's one of the promises they continue to want to make. This will have a continuing effect on our markets." Wal-Mart on Thursday reported third quarter earnings with worse than expected sales, also due to falling food prices. Boer said Ahold Delhaize is familiar with both German chains due to their growth in the Netherlands. Ahold Delhaize owns the dominant Dutch chain Albert Heijn, which has thrived despite a German onslaught. "As a European retailer in the U.S...we are sharing a lot of our information about the work Lidl and Aldi are doing (in the Dutch market) to help our American colleagues to be well prepared." Boer also said he expects commodity price deflation, which has impacted meat and dairy prices, to ease next year. He said it was too early to say whether the election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president would lead to higher inflation, as some investors are speculating. Ahold Delhaize shares were down 3.5 percent at 19.92 euros at 1600 GMT in Amsterdam.

During the post-earnings call with investors, CEO Doug McMillion mentioned the world’s largest retailer’s commitment to being the best and beating all comers. “Overall, we’re in it to win it,” McMillion noted toward the end of his remarks as he finished off listing Walmart’s myriad accomplishments in Q3. And, as has been Walmart’s pattern in 2016, there is a fair amount to crow about. For the third quarter in a row Walmart has beaten analysts’ predictions on revenue and marked same-store sales increases (a difficult magic trick in retail these days) — and in Q3 the company also had some more than solid growth in eCommerce lines and on the global scene. But investors were less than thrilled by all those green arrows — as they were accompanied by an uncomfortably red arrow in the profitability tally — and share prices have taken a hit, down around 2.9  percent in pre-market trading. So what’s the need to know in all that information? By The Numbers  Walmart managed to beat on earnings again in Q3, noting $0.98 a share, $0.02 more than the Wall Street consensus, according to Bloomberg. Sales, however, were a bit of a miss, though they increased. Walmart brought in sales of $118.18 billion, an 0.7 percent increase over the prior year period, but below the Thomson Reuters forecast of $118.7 billion. Comparable-store sales were up by 1.2 percent — which again was a slight miss of the 1.3 forecast for the quarter. Traffic was on the increase, up 0.7 percent, a fact McMillion credited Walmart’s staff with. The biggest numerical miss was in profit, which was down 8.2 percent. That big bite comes as Walmart is investing big in infrastructure, store modernization and eCommerce enhancements. Those improvements — although necessary to achieve Walmart’s vision of being the and most reliable retailer in the world, according to McMillion — have also cost the retailer billions of dollars. Most notably and recently that included the $3 billion acquisition of Jet.com. But that investment is already showing signs of bearing fruit — as Walmart’s eCommerce results in Q3 were striking — and greatly picked up on the pace of anemic eCommerce growth in the year’s prior two quarters. Digital sales popped up 20.6 percent (excluding currency swings). That figure, comprising an assist from Jet.com, was included in the quarter for six weeks. All in all, eCommerce sales added 0.5 percent to the U.S. same-store sales figure, “our largest contribution yet,” McMillon noted. “We’re executing well in our stores and making strategic investments in eCommerce to accelerate growth,” he added. In It To Win It  Though Walmart’s less-than-expected haul cause investors some heartburn, the figures hit about 24 hours after rival Target announced same-store sales with falling traffic (although with sincere hopes that the situation would be flipped during the upcoming holiday). Charlie O’Shea, lead retail analyst at Moody’s, thinks that Walmart could also have a killer Christmas if the company can leverage its store network to handle online orders, especially via its buy-online/pick-up-in-store capability, as well as increasing benefits from Jet.com. McMillon also noted that Walmart isn’t just growing eCommerce, it is building it out right, with a partner in Jet.com that fully understands and supports Walmart’s commitment to “basket economics.” “When customers build a bigger basket online, everybody actually wins — and the system functions better for everyone,” he said. Walmart very much wants to win. And against its physical world peers, it is well positioned — as earnings have tumbled out this week, brick-and-mortar players (particularly department and box stores) have been rolling out results that are not exactly stellar. If that is the race, Walmart is well ahead of the game. But Walmart’s real race is with the future — and a shopping base that is moving ever more online. The competition is there with Amazon, the retail upstart that stole Walmart’s market cap crown a year or two ago. Walmart wants that crown back — and is willing to sacrifice an awful lot of money and effort to get there. It should be a holiday season well worth watching.

Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen testified before Congress that signs of an improving U.S. economy has strengthened the case for a rate increase sooner rather than later. She also noted that the risk of spurring a recession climbs if the central bank continues to wait to make a move and then is forced to raise rates too quickly later. "This is a much stronger hint than ever given before," said Peggy Bowie, a senior equity trader at Manulife Asset Management. "Her guidance after that basically is, if they don't make a move, I think she hinted that they could end up behind the curve. The near-term risk could be unbalanced and they would have to move faster." Investors have anticipated for months that the Fed would raise rates at its next two-day meeting starting Dec. 13, after the dust settles on the U.S. election results earlier this month. It's expected that it will be a small increase of a quarter of a percentage point, from the current range of 0.25 per cent to 0.5 per cent. The central bank last made a move on rates a year ago in December. It had forecasted multiple rate hikes in 2016, but economic data showed weak growth, forcing it to pause its plans. On Wall Street, stock markets reacted favourably, with bank stocks seeing a sharp rise. Higher interest rates bode well for financial institutions who will earn more profits on loans. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 35.68 points at 18,903.82, while the S&P 500 advanced 10.18 points at 2,187.12. Almost all of the S&P 500's gains since the presidential election have gone to financial stocks. They lagged the market for much of this year, but they're now trading at their highest levels since May 2008, months before the financial crisis peaked. Investors hope banks will benefit from higher interest rates, faster economic growth and lighter regulation under U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. The Nasdaq composite jumped 39.39 points at 5,333.97. In Toronto, the S&P/TSX composite gained 92.87 points at 14,826.09, pushed higher as consumer discretionary and industrials stocks advanced. Bowie said the industrials sector is still enjoying the optimism from Trump's victory. One of Trump's biggest promises has been that he will put money towards new, massive infrastructure projects. In currencies, the Canadian dollar dipped 0.36 of a U.S. cent at 74.04 cents US, as oil tracked lower and the U.S. dollar strengthened. In commodities, the December crude oil contract declined 15 cents at US$45.42 per barrel, while the January contract, which traded at a higher volume, fell 12 cents at $45.98 per barrel. The December gold contract lost $7 at US$1,216.90 per ounce and the December copper contract gained two cents at US$2.49 per pound. The December contract for natural gas fell six cents at US$2.70 per mmBTU.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.8 percent to 18,011.79 as the yen hit a six-month low, helping shares of the country’s big exporters. South Korea’s Kospi shed 0.4 percent to 1,972.64 while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.3 percent to 22,318.47. The Shanghai Composite slipped 0.1 percent to 3,206.64 while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 crept up 0.2 percent to 5,347.30. Benchmarks in Taiwan and Indonesia fell while Singapore’s rose. RATE HORIZON: In remarks to Congress, Yellen suggested the U.S. central bank is on track to raise interest rates when policymakers hold their final meeting of the year in December. She said the improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising rates, in comments that increased certainty for investors. The Fed raised its key interest rate in December 2015 but it’s still at ultralow levels that have fueled a multiyear global stock market boom. Economists forecast rates will go up by a quarter-point in December followed by two more hikes in 2017. MARKET INSIGHT: “The greatest uncertainties, namely the election and the Fed rate hike, were significantly reduced over the last two weeks, which gave the market a good reason to refocus on the fundamentals of economic and corporate earnings,” said Margaret Yang, an analyst at CMC Markets. CURRENCIES: The greenback rallied on the prospect of U.S. higher interest rates. The dollar climbed to 110.60 yen — its highest since the end of May — from 110.17 yen in late trading Thursday. The euro fell to its lowest in nearly a year, sinking to $1.0597 from $1.0614. WALL STREET: The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.2 percent to 18,903.82. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 0.5 percent to 2,187.12. The Nasdaq composite added 0.7 percent to 5,333.97. ENERGY: Oil extended its decline. Benchmark U.S. crude futures slid 54 cents to $44.88 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 15 cents to settle at $45.42 a barrel on Thursday. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slipped 43 cents to $46.69 a barrel in London.

Life Buy/Sell U.S. Business AP Arkansas high court bars union from protesting at Wal-Mart By ANDREW DeMILLO Associated Press Nov 17, 2016 (…) LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — A labor union was kept barred from protesting or demonstrating at Wal-Mart's stores and offices in Arkansas after the state's highest court on Thursday scaled back a judge's order prohibiting the group from entering the retail giant's property for anything other than shopping. The Arkansas Supreme Court upheld a Benton County judge's trespassing order against the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, but modified the injunction to cover only activities such as picketing, demonstrations and flash mobs against the Bentonville-based company. "We agree with the union that the circuit court's injunction and declaration encompassing all non-shopping activity or conduct is simply too broad," the court said in its ruling. The union and its affiliate group, the Organization United for Respect at Wal-Mart, had argued that the National Labor Relations Board, not the Benton County judge, should have jurisdiction over the matter. Justices disagreed and noted that appellate courts in several other states have rejected that argument. "We are pleased at the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision to narrow the overbroad order," Randy Parraz, campaign director for the union's Making Change at Wal-Mart campaign, said in a statement. "Make no mistake, Making Change at Walmart will continue to fight for a better life for the millions of hard-working Walmart employees in every state across this country whose economic struggles have been long forgotten or ignored by Walmart and so many others." Wal-Mart sued the union over the demonstrations, which it said has included flash mobs where demonstrators have banged on pots and pans and marched and chanted through its stores. Other activities have included rallies and picketing at its stores and offices, the company said. The retail giant has filed similar suits against the union in Florida and Texas in recent years. "We appreciate the court protecting property rights and upholding our right to seek enforcement of the trespass laws against unions in these situations," Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg said in an email. "As the court's opinion notes, other states have agreed with this approach." The union had argued that the company's trespassing complaint in Arkansas was nearly identical to one it had also filed with the national board. An attorney for Wal-Mart told the court last month that trespassing was a state issue and was properly before the state judge.

"Further, picketing, patrolling, parading, demonstrations, hand-billing and solicitation are all protected activities under the right circumstances," she wrote. "It behooves this court to return this case to the circuit court where an order that clearly does not run afoul of the National Labor Relations Act can be crafted with the assistance of the litigants." ___ Follow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ademillo Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today 3 Big Gifts Walmart Just Delivered to Investors Before Black Friday Wall Street may have been lukewarm on Walmart's third-quarter results, but the retailer had several important wins. Brian Sozzi Nov 17, 2016 10:35 AM EST While Wall Street handed Walmart (WMT) a lump of coal on Thursday in response to third-quarter earnings, the world's largest retailer managed to score several big wins in front of the crucial holiday shopping season.  Walmart's stock fell about 3% in early trading Thursday as total sales rose 0.7% from the prior year to $118.2 billion, missing Wall Street forecasts for $118.8 billion. Sales were clipped by $2.1 billion due to the relative strength of the U.S. dollar since the summer months. Food price deflation didn't help the company, either.  Earnings came in at 98 cents a share, beating projections for 96 cents a share. Walmart lifted its full-year earnings outlook to $4.20 to $4.35 a share from previous guidance of $4.15 to $4.35 a share. Here are several key things Wall Street may have overlooked in Walmart's earnings report that suggest the holiday season may turn out pretty festive for the Bentonville, AR. based discounter.   Walmart has more momentum headed into holidays than its archnemesis.  Amid investments in lower merchandise prices and higher wages for store workers, Walmart's U.S. sales are on the comeback trail. Walmart U.S. notched a same-store sales increase of 1.2%, the division's ninth straight gain. Meanwhile, Target's (TGT) third-quarter same-store sales fell for the second consecutive quarter, dropping 0.2%.  The momentum this year for Walmart is a sign its initiatives to draw in spendthrift U.S. shoppers are working, and may pay big dividends during the holiday season.  Prev 0 of 2 Next If you liked this article you might like Jim Cramer's Mad Money: Keep One Eye on Earnings, the Other on Politics Next Week Holiday-shortened week holds a feast of earnings reports, says Jim Cramer.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.8 percent to 18,011.79 as the yen hit a six-month low, helping shares of the country's big exporters. South Korea's Kospi shed 0.4 percent to 1,972.64 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.3 percent to 22,318.47. The Shanghai Composite slipped 0.1 percent to 3,206.64 while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 crept up 0.2 percent to 5,347.30. Benchmarks in Taiwan and Indonesia fell while Singapore's rose. RATE HORIZON: In remarks to Congress, Yellen suggested the U.S. central bank is on track to raise interest rates when policymakers hold their final meeting of the year in December. She said the improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising rates, in comments that increased certainty for investors. The Fed raised its key interest rate in December 2015 but it's still at ultralow levels that have fueled a multiyear global stock market boom. Economists forecast rates will go up by a quarter-point in December followed by two more hikes in 2017. MARKET INSIGHT: "The greatest uncertainties, namely the election and the Fed rate hike, were significantly reduced over the last two weeks, which gave the market a good reason to refocus on the fundamentals of economic and corporate earnings," said Margaret Yang, an analyst at CMC Markets. CURRENCIES: The greenback rallied on the prospect of U.S. higher interest rates. The dollar climbed to 110.60 yen — its highest since the end of May — from 110.17 yen in late trading Thursday. The euro fell to its lowest in nearly a year, sinking to $1.0597 from $1.0614. WALL STREET: The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.2 percent to 18,903.82. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.5 percent to 2,187.12. The Nasdaq composite added 0.7 percent to 5,333.97. ENERGY: Oil extended its decline. Benchmark U.S. crude futures slid 54 cents to $44.88 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 15 cents to settle at $45.42 a barrel on Thursday. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slipped 43 cents to $46.69 a barrel in London. 0 Shares Email Star Comments Asian Shares Mixed, Nikkei up as Yellen Remarks Lift Dollar " Trump Set to Meet Today With Kris Kobach, Christie, Giuliani and Others " Trump Holds Meetings With Mitt Romney, Michelle Rhee and Others " Reince Priebus Dismisses Controversy Over Sessions: 'He Will Be Confirmed' " Powerful Winter Storm Pounds Midwest and Great Lakes Region " Police: Missing Kansas Newborn Found in Dallas; 2 in Custody " Trump Offers Sen.

By Roger Baird November 17, 2016 14:34 GMT Supermarket Asda posted another sharp fall in its third quarter salesMatt Cardy/Getty Images Supermarket Asda has posted another sharp fall in sales, highlighting the uphill task the new boss faces as he attempts to turn the business around. The chain – owned by US retail giant Walmart – reported a 5.8% plunge in like-for-likes sales, excluding petrol, in its third quarter to 30 September. This comes on the back of a poor previous three months, when the group reported a 7.5% slump in sales, its worst quarterly performance on record. Major supermarkets such as Asda have been locked in a five-year price war with discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, as cash-strapped shoppers hunt for lower prices. New chief executive Sean Clarke, who took up the reins in July replacing previous boss Andy Clarke, has slashed the prices of everyday items as he bids to arrest falling sales at the group. Clarke, the former boss of Walmart's China business, said: "We have lowered thousands of prices, improved hundreds of own brand products and invested in more hours for colleagues on the shop floor – so it's encouraging to see more customers shopping with us in stores and online." Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said about the group's UK arm: "The key priority remains driving an improved customer experience and building sales momentum by simplifying the offer, improving product availability and making strategic investments in service and price." High street retailers have been hit by the slump in the value of the pound since June's Brexit vote, which is putting pressure on suppliers to raise prices to cover mounting costs. Respected Kantar Worldpanel data said Asda's sales dropped 5.2% in the latest quarter – the slowest decline for four months. But its market share slipped by one percentage point to 15.6%. However, Asda is being outpaced by major rivals, with Tesco increasing its market share for the first time in five years after Kantar said its sales rose by 1.3%. Morrisons also recently saw like-for-like sales lift 1.6% in the third quarter, boosted by strong trading at Halloween.

Denise Collier-Bailey said she just noticed two men sitting in the vestibule of the Short Pump superstore. It wasn't until she actually walked inside the store that her daughter asked, "Did you see that deer in the shopping cart?" Collier-Bailey had not, so she and her teenage daughter walked back out to get a closer look. The daughter took a photo. Dead deer in Walmart shopping cart (PHOTO: Denise Collier-Bailey) The gutted deer was in the shopping cart, dripping blood on the floor, she said. "The things you see at Wal-Mart," she said in a phone interview with WTVR on Wednesday. "This just topped it all." Collier-Bailey said she did not bother the men and just went back into Wal-Mart after taking the photos. "We were just... I couldn't believe it," Collier-Bailey said. Dead deer in Walmart shopping cart (PHOTO: Denise Collier-Bailey) Walmart spokesman Charles Crowson confirmed the incident. He said a customer alerted store management and a manager quickly told the men to take their deer and go. Crowson did not know why the men rolled the dead deer into Walmart, but made it clear the carcass never made it into the shopping areas of the store. Commenters on the WTVR's Facebook page reported they had seen a deer running around the area earlier that evening. One even reported the deer had been hit and killed by a vehicle near Wal-Mart. Lee Walker, with the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, speculated the men might be hunters simply trying to follow Virginia law. "It appears that they were trying to follow the law by checking in the harvested deer, but were not at an approved check station," Walker said. "In most cases hunters do not bring harvested game actually into an approved checked station, but rather have someone from the store come out to verify the harvest and to record the needed information." Main deer hunting season in much of the state runs through Jan. 2. 37.666109 -77.627838 Filed in: Nation/World Topics: Virginia, Wal-Mart Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email KTLA 5 News on Facebook Popular New Federal Overtime Law Takes Effect Dec. 1, Will Impact Millions of U.S. Workers Arizona Grandmother’s Accidental Invite to Wrong Teen for Thanksgiving Dinner Goes Viral Texas Teacher Impregnated by 13-Year-Old Student She Had Sex With ‘on Almost Daily Basis’ Pleads Guilty: Report Professor Who Correctly Predicted 2016 Election Outcome Forecasts Trump Impeachment Latest News Liberte and Justice for Paws, November 20, 2016 NASA Launches New Satellite to Improve Aging Weather Satellite System With More Precise Data, Near Real-Time Imagery Priebus Defends Trump’s $25M Settlement Saying President-Elect Wants to Lead Country ‘Without Distraction’ Anaheim Police Fatally Shoot Suspect Wanted for Allegedly Ramming SUV into Another Car on 91 Freeway; No Officers Injured Nation/World Texas Police Launch Investigation After Facebook Photos Show Man Apparently Dragging Girl By Hair Through Wal-Mart Nation/World 1 Dead, 2 Injured as Good Samaritans Save Mom, Baby From Attackers Outside Wal-Mart in Kansas Nation/World Mother Gives Birth in Checkout Line at Utah Wal-Mart, Insists on Paying for Merchandise Nation/World Stranger Grabbed, Choked 4-Month-Old in Wal-Mart Checkout Line, Kansas Mother Says Local News Mom Arrested After Allegedly Leaving Baby in Car While Shopping at Wal-Mart in Palm Springs Nation/World Texas Teacher Brought to Tears When Good Samaritan Pays for Her School Supplies at Wal-Mart Nation/World US Government Grants Wal-Mart Patent to Roll Out ‘Self-Driving’ Shopping Carts Nation/World Wal-Mart to Cut 7,000 Jobs, Offer Workers New Role in Company Nation/World Dashcam Video Captures Driver Apparently Being Attacked by Deer She Hit on New Jersey Road Money Smart Nation/World Nearly 1 Million Wal-Mart Workers Awarded Cash Bonuses as Part of Incentive Plan Nation/World Florida Wal-Mart Removes 9/11-Themed Coke Display After Photo Sparks Backlash Nation/World Woman Dies After Being Run Over by Her Own Vehicle in Parking Lot of Memphis Wal-Mart Local News Family of North Hollywood Ice Cream Vendor Starts Fundraising Page to Help Him Retire After Violent Robbery Mobile Apps Android App iPhone & iPad App KTLA 5 News on Social Media Watch CW Shows Facebook Twitter Instagram Email Alerts About & Contact screenertv Screener Online Public File • Terms of Service • Privacy Policy • 5800 Sunset Blvd. Los Angeles, CA, 90028 • Copyright © 2016, KTLA • A Tribune Broadcasting Station • Powered by WordPress.com VIP × Email Alerts Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.8 percent to 18,011.79 as the yen hit a six-month low, helping shares of the country's big exporters. South Korea's Kospi shed 0.4 percent to 1,972.64 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.3 percent to 22,318.47. The Shanghai Composite slipped 0.1 percent to 3,206.64 while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 crept up 0.2 percent to 5,347.30. Benchmarks in Taiwan and Indonesia fell while Singapore's rose. RATE HORIZON: In remarks to Congress, Yellen suggested the U.S. central bank is on track to raise interest rates when policymakers hold their final meeting of the year in December. She said the improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising rates, in comments that increased certainty for investors. The Fed raised its key interest rate in December 2015 but it's still at ultralow levels that have fueled a multiyear global stock market boom. Economists forecast rates will go up by a quarter-point in December followed by two more hikes in 2017. Money traders work at a foreign exchange brokerage in Tokyo, Friday, Nov. 18, 2016.

(AP Photo/Koji Sasahara) MARKET INSIGHT: "The greatest uncertainties, namely the election and the Fed rate hike, were significantly reduced over the last two weeks, which gave the market a good reason to refocus on the fundamentals of economic and corporate earnings," said Margaret Yang, an analyst at CMC Markets. CURRENCIES: The greenback rallied on the prospect of U.S. higher interest rates. The dollar climbed to 110.60 yen — its highest since the end of May — from 110.17 yen in late trading Thursday. The euro fell to its lowest in nearly a year, sinking to $1.0597 from $1.0614. WALL STREET: The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.2 percent to 18,903.82. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.5 percent to 2,187.12. The Nasdaq composite added 0.7 percent to 5,333.97. ENERGY: Oil extended its decline. Benchmark U.S. crude futures slid 54 cents to $44.88 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 15 cents to settle at $45.42 a barrel on Thursday. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slipped 43 cents to $46.69 a barrel in London. Money traders work at a foreign exchange brokerage in Tokyo, Friday, Nov. 18, 2016.

Revenue was below forecasts, and U.S. comparable-store sales were up 1.2 percent compared to estimates of up 1.3 percent. Wal-Mart did raise the lower end of its full-year earnings forecast range. Best Buy — The electronics retailer reported a blowout quarter, beating earnings estimates by 15 cents a share at an adjusted 62 cents per share. Revenue and same-store sales were both above estimates, as well. JM Smucker — The food producer earned an adjusted $2.05 per share for its latest quarter, beating estimates of $1.93 a share. Revenue came in below Street forecasts. The company's results were impacted by slower sales of pet foods like Meow Mix, as well as Folgers coffee and JIF peanut butter. Staples — The office products retailer matched estimates, with adjusted quarterly profit of 34 cents per share. Revenue was below forecasts. Staples saw a bigger-than-expected four percent drop in same-store sales during the quarter, as it continues to work through its turnaround plan. Amazon.com, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Netflix — Piper Jaffray issued a report saying the "fear trade" that's battered these mega-cap tech stocks presents a rare buying opportunity. Piper feels the fear came from Donald Trump sound bites that are unlikely to manifest themselves in actual policy. Microsoft — Microsoft was upgraded to "buy" from "neutral" at Goldman Sachs, with the price target raised to $68 per share from $60 a share. The firm said its upgrade is based on improving revenue and profit margins in Microsoft's ongoing shift to cloud-based business. Chipotle Mexican Grill — Guggenheim downgraded the restaurant chain to "sell" from "neutral," citing increased valuation risk with optimism about a recovery already baked into the stock's price. It said Chipotle faces increasing competition and margin pressures going forward. First Solar — JMP upgraded the solar company to "market perform" from "market underperform," saying the company's financial issues are now reflected in the stock's price and that it is taking appropriate steps to fix its finances. Cisco Systems — The networking equipment maker reported adjusted quarterly profit of 61 cents per share, two cents a share above estimates. Revenue was also slightly above forecasts, but the company gave current-quarter guidance below Street forecasts amid increasing competition and slowing demand from the telecom industry. L Brands — L Brands came in two cents a share ahead of estimates, with quarterly profit of 42 cents per share. Revenue was also slightly above estimates. The Victoria's Secret parent gave current-quarter earnings guidance that came in below consensus forecasts, however, citing an increasingly competitive environment and overall slowing store traffic for retailers. NetApp — NetApp reported adjusted quarterly profit of 60 cents per share, six cents a share above estimates. Revenue was slightly short of forecasts for the provider of data storage services. NetApp cheered investors by providing better-than-expected guidance for the current quarter, amid cuts in expenses. Amgen — Amgen announced upbeat results for its experimental migraine drug in a phase 3 study. The biotech firm said the drug significantly reduced monthly migraines and that the study results were statistically significant. JPMorgan Chase — The bank will reported pay more than $250 million to settle a U.S. probe into its China hiring practices, according to Reuters. Hain Celestial — Hain's shares are getting a boost after an independent review showed no wrongdoing in the organic food company's accounting practices. Toyota — The automaker will set up a new electric vehicle unit, aiming to get an all-electric product to market as quickly as possible.

Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA Sarah Butler @whatbutlersaw Thursday 17 November 2016 12.52 EST Last modified on Thursday 17 November 2016 17.00 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Asda has reported a near 6% fall in sales at established stores, confirming its position as the worst performing major UK supermarket. Sales at the Walmart-owned chain’s established stores dropped by 5.8% in the three months to 30 September. That was an improvement on the previous quarter, when sales were down by 7.5%, but puts Asda well behind rivals Tesco and Morrisons, which recently reported underlying sales growth. Last week, Sainsbury’s announced a 1% fall in underlying sales in the 28 weeks to 24 September. Walmart said the UK was the only one of its 11 international markets not experiencing growth at stores open for more than a year, as the number of shoppers fell by 4.2% year on year. Operating income also dipped in the UK, with shoppers spending 1.6% less on average on each visit. Walmart’s chief financial officer, Brett Biggs, said: “The key priority remains driving an improved customer experience and building sales momentum by simplifying the offer, improving product availability and making strategic investments in service and price.” Asda is trying to fight off heavy competition from the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl, which have stolen its once strong position as the UK’s cheapest grocer. Asda only operates large outlets and has been unable to tap into the rise of convenience stores, unlike Tesco and Sainsbury’s. It has also suffered from a number of recent upsets, including a card reader glitch that led to angry queues of customers in stores last month and a BBC Watchdog investigation that criticised Asda for dirty home delivery crates. Patrick O’Brien, an analyst at consultancy Verdict Retail, said: “Asda’s positioning has plunged it into crisis. The discounters have undermined its low price stance, but it is unable to position its brand or customer experience as offering more than the discounters, in the way that its big four rivals have been able to do. The others never traded on being the cheapest, but Asda did, and now it isn’t.” He said that unless Walmart chose to use its financial muscle “to take the price war to a new level”, Asda had to find a new way to attract shoppers. Sean Clarke, who stepped in to replace Andy Clarke as chief executive of Asda in July, said shopper numbers had started rising again over the previous quarter. “We have lowered thousands of prices, improved hundreds of own brand products and invested in more hours for colleagues on the shop floor, so it’s encouraging to see more customers shopping with us in stores and online,” he said. Consumer body Which? had found Asda to have the lowest prices on branded groceries for the seventh month in a row, recognising continuing price cuts at the supermarket, Clarke said.

By Liam Martin PUBLISHED: 08:40, Fri, Nov 18, 2016 | UPDATED: 15:35, Fri, Nov 18, 2016 Nintendo Classic Mini may be sold out in the UK, but the mini NES is available to buy in limited quantities in North America. With stock in such limited supply that some retailers weren't able to fulfil pre-orders, the news that US chain Walmart has new stock is a positive development for retro gaming fans hoping to buy one in time for Christmas. "Want the hottest gift of the holiday season?" reads a Walmart post. "Well, come and get it at Walmart.com. It’s available for sale at 2pm PST daily from Nov. 14 – Nov. 18. Limited quantities." The Nintendo Classic Mini page currently has placeholder prices attached, but the console will go on sale for the recommended retail price when stock is released. UK customers are currently faced with two choices. They can either wait for more stock to be released, or pay well over the odds for Nintendo Classic Mini consoles on sites like Amazon, eBay and in CEX.

"The Nintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition system is a hot item, and we are working hard to keep up with consumer demand," reads a Nintendo tweet. "There will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year. Smyths dropped a big hint about when the Nintendo Classic NES might be back in stock, telling fans to expect more units before December 9. "Based on our initial allocation, all pre-orders are not guaranteed the Nintendo Classic Mini on release day," reads a Smyths statement. "We expect all pre-orders will be fulfilled by December 9. You will be notified via email of the expected delivery date closer to the time." Express Online has contacted Nintendo for an update on Nintendo Classic Mini stock. In terms of games, the Nintendo Classic Mini features Final Fantasy, the original Super Mario Bros Trilogy, The Legend of Zelda, Castlevania and Mega Man 2. There’s also games like Double Dragon, Balloon Fight, Metroid and Donkey Kong.

Asda said underlying sales, excluding fuel, fell 5.8 percent in the three months to end September, an improvement on the record 7.5 percent drop recorded in the previous period but still the ninth straight quarter of decline. Asda, Britain's third biggest supermarket behind Tesco , Sainsbury's and ahead of Morrisons, has been hit by the advance of German discounters Aldi and Lidl. While the other three traditional groups have upped their game in recent years and started to fight back, Asda is still struggling to adapt and win back customers in the fiercely competitive sector. Asda's UK market share has slipped a full 1 percentage point over the last year to 15.5 percent. The task of steadying the ship falls to Sean Clarke, the former boss of Wal-Mart's China business who took over the top job in July. "We have lowered thousands of prices, improved hundreds of own brand products and invested in more hours for colleagues on the shop floor - so it's encouraging to see more customers shopping with us in stores and online," Clarke said.

Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.2 percent in the third quarter, the company said in a statement Thursday. That was just shy of the 1.3 percent predicted by analysts and marked a slowdown from the previous quarter. Total revenue also missed estimates, hurt in part by currency headwinds. The sluggish sales raised concerns for investors, despite Wal-Mart coming through on its pledge to energize its e-commerce business. Wal-Mart’s $3 billion purchase of Jet.com in September helped fuel a 21 percent gain in online sales last quarter, an acceleration from the 12 percent gain in the second quarter. But at its physical stores, a historic streak of food deflation put pressure on the chain. “We are not satisfied,” Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said in the statement. “We will continue to change and pick up speed to reach our longer-term aspirations.” Wal-Mart shares fell as much as 4.3 percent to $68.32 in New York, the biggest intraday drop since May. The stock had climbed 16 percent this year through Wednesday’s close, lifted by improving performance. That outpaced the 6.5 percent gain of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Revenue increased 0.7 percent to $118.2 billion in the third quarter, which ended Oct. 31. Overseas, the strong dollar weighed on sales, turning a 2.4 percent increase at its international unit into a 4.8 percent decline. But profit exceeded projections. Earnings amounted to 98 cents a share, topping the 96 cent estimate, helped by a better tax rate than analysts were anticipating. Wal-Mart also raised the lower end of its forecast for the year. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company now expects annual earnings of $4.20 to $4.35 a share, excluding some items. It had previously set the bottom of the range at $4.15. Trump Impact? Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said it is too early to tell how the incoming Donald Trump administration will affect its business. The president-elect’s pledge to renegotiate trade deals with Mexico and China could have a major impact on Wal-Mart, which imports many of its products from China and has a large business in Mexico. “It is way too early to speculate on anything that might happen with the president-elect,” Biggs said. “When policies change or shift, we will be ready to respond to those and make sure we do what is right for the company.” Grocery prices across the country have dropped on a year-over-year basis for 10 straight months, a streak of deflation not seen since 1960. That’s been good for consumers, but it’s brought headaches to Wal-Mart, the largest seller of groceries in the U.S. Eggs and beef have have grown especially cheap, making competition fiercer between supermarkets. The run of deflation has squeezed profit margins and sent shares of some low-cost chains tumbling. Since taking the helm in 2014, McMillon has boosted pay for U.S. workers, tried to improve Wal-Mart’s grocery quality and spent billions on its online operations -- aiming to gain ground on Amazon.com Inc. He also is pushing to lower Wal-Mart’s prices, clean up stores and take better care of customers. E-commerce sales growth had been slowing, and Wal-Mart has been trying to shore up the business. The Jet.com deal gave Wal-Mart access to the startup’s technology and management, as well as contributing more than a month worth of its sales to the retailer’s third quarter. “E-commerce was a highlight,” Biggs said in an interview. “We expect to continue seeing that momentum.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

LOCAL STORIES | GREEN | HEALTH | OPINIONS      CALENDAR | ARTS&CULTURE | MUSIC | DINING | FILM | GUIDES | N&R EVENTS      CLASSIFIEDS Tweet Walmart wins Big box set to expand with nod from City Council By Howard Hardee This article was published on 11.17.16. Advertisement As a member of the public told the Chico City Council during its meeting on Tuesday (Nov. 15), Walmart’s proposed expansion needn’t be a divisive, left vs. right issue. And yet, when it came to a decision, the panel split down party lines, voting 4-3 to approve the big-box’s bid to get even bigger. The proposal for the retail giant’s location on Forest Avenue includes an interior expansion of about 64,500 square feet, including more space for groceries and a deli; 134 additional parking spaces; a pick-up area for customers who order groceries or prescription drugs online; an eight-pump gas station and convenience store; street access improvements; and two parcels for future development. On Oct. 5, the Chico Planning Commission voted 5-2 to greenlight the project. A couple of weeks later, a group opposing Walmart’s expansion filed an appeal. Brett Jolley, an attorney out of Stockton, delivered it on behalf of Chico Advocates for a Responsible Economy (CARE), which mounted a successful campaign against Walmart’s plans for a supercenter a decade ago. On Tuesday, the City Council held a public hearing as its members decided whether to uphold or deny the appeal. Jolley presented his client’s case against Walmart. He argued that the council couldn’t certify the findings in the environmental impact report (EIR) because it understates the potential negative economic effects on nearby grocery stores such as FoodMaxx and WinCo. Also, the corporation recently has revealed plans to close 200 stores nationwide as sales shift online, diminishing the need for brick-and-mortar locations. “What happens when this store goes out of business? You don’t want to be stuck with a vacant big box,” Jolley said. Councilwoman Reanette Fillmer was skeptical. “Just out of curiosity, how many lawsuits against Walmart have you filed, besides this one?” she asked Jolley. “In my my career, over the last 15 years, I’d estimate probably 10 to 15,” he said. “And then, you’re from Stockton, not from the city of Chico?” Fillmer followed up. “That’s correct,” Jolley answered. Mayor Mark Sorensen jumped in: “And who pays for your efforts?” The attorney seemed puzzled. “Well,” he said, “different clients pay for my efforts.” That exchange resurfaced throughout the hearing, including when the council opened the floor for public comment. “The attorney being from Stockton is not an issue, and I don’t know why that came up,” speaker Chris Nelson said. “Our city attorney isn’t local, either.” Nearly 30 people addressed the dais. Opponents cited the expansion’s potential to increase traffic congestion and air pollution in Chico’s southeast shopping district, the corporation’s poor treatment of employees and its well-documented strategy of putting competing local retailers out of business. On the other hand, the council heard from elderly and low-income residents who said Walmart is the only place they can afford to shop. As for employment practices, store manager Kim Turner said that 78 percent of Walmart’s employees in Chico are full-time and some enjoy generous salaries and benefits packages. “If they’re happy working at Walmart, that’s their business,” she said. Walmart’s corporate representatives had the last word. Philip Serghini, director of public affairs, said the Chico location opened in 1994 and badly needs an upgrade. The bigger store would hire 85 more employees and provide the city with an additional $314,000 in annual sales tax revenue, he said. “We want to give you the Walmart that you deserve.” It was Councilwoman Tami Ritter’s turn to be skeptical: “Mr. Serghini, where do you live?” “San Diego,” he replied. “And how many of these appeals do you do?” she pressed. “This is part of my full-time job,” Serghini said. Vice Mayor Sean Morgan made a motion to reject CARE’s appeal, which was seconded by Fillmer. Sorensen voted yes, but took a moment to reflect on Chico’s years-long Walmart saga. In 2009, he said, the council imposed “arbitrary and capricious demands that never would have been put on anyone else proposing the same project,” he said. “That debacle reverberated through the business community for years. … People really underestimate the damage that did to our ability to attract businesses.” Morgan’s motion passed, with Ritter and Councilmembers Ann Schwab and Randall Stone dissenting.

KMGH Copyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next DENVER -- The hottest toy of 2016 is nearly impossible to find, even though it's 30-years-old. The NES Classic Edition, an old school Nintendo with 30 preloaded games has been sold out since it went on sale on Friday. This week, however, Walmart has been putting an unknown number of consoles on sale every day at 3 p.m. Mountain Time. HOW-TO: Click here to go to the page that you'll need to repeatedly refresh at 3 p.m. Denver7 reporter (and former Nintendo owner) Marshall Zelinger, tried buying the Nintendo throwback at 3 p.m., ignoring his afternoon news meeting. After getting a "technical difficulties" error, an NES Classic was put in his checkout cart, and when he went to check out, the website said: "We're sorry, the item below is no longer available." After trying to check out a second time, another screen showed a new failure: "Due to state restrictions this item can't be shipped to 80203 or picked up in stores nearby." Walmart media relations did not respond to questions in an email form request sent shortly after the website fake out. Denver7 still wants to know how many consoles are being released each day and why the website appeared to find one in stock, just to say it was no longer available. When you try on Thursday and Friday, you may want to log into a Walmart online account ahead of time, for fast checkout. Also get acquainted with your "F5" key to refresh the page. eBay and other online shopping sites have NES Classic consoles already posted for four times as much, and one listed at $3,999.99. Why is the hottest toy something that many video gamers got tired of decades ago? "Just taking me back to my childhood, back to simpler times when we weren't hustling and bustling, worried about who the President was," said Justin Branch. "If you're looking at who grew up with it, we're all parents now, so who's going to buy it for their kids? The parents are buying it for their kids and the parents are going to want to play it with their kids." "I don't know if it's the simplicity or nostalgia," said Austin Clarkson. Denver7 found the two video gamers at Grandma's House, a brewery on South Broadway in Denver. Besides beer, the menu includes video games from yesteryear. "That's actually why we came here, was to play these games," said Clarkson. "They're pretty tough too. They're pretty challenging. You can't go back to a saved position. You have to sit down and play through the entire game, there's no going back, which I completely forgot about that." While chatting with Denver7, Branch was busy playing Street Fighter for Super Nintendo. He said he still had his original Nintendo at home. "Still rocking the Paperboy, Mario Bros, even some Tecmo Bowl," he said. "Man, if you ain't blowing in the cartridges man, you ain't doing it right." That's one benefit of the new system -- there is no need to blow into the cartridge itself to get the game to work. (Reporter's Note: You'll likely find online articles that suggest blowing into the cartridge did nothing, but Nintendo video gamers know that's not true.) Target, which is also sold out of the console, told Denver7: "We will be replenishing inventory throughout the holiday season and encourage guests to check back at their local Target store." Best Buy responded: "We don't comment on inventory, nor future release plans." --------- Sign up for Denver7 email alerts to stay informed about breaking news and daily headlines.

Shopping 5 0 0 November 16, 2016 Black Friday 2016 Deals And Ads: Walmart And Sears Pre-Black Friday Sales Are Live — Are They Any Good? Phillip Dengler Black Friday 2016, which will take place on November 25, is now only a little over a week away. While it remains one of the biggest days of the year for shopping, the sales actually start before the day itself. In addition to many Black Friday sales starting on Thanksgiving, others have already begun. Today, Walmart and Sears announced that pre-Black Friday sales would begin on their websites. While the top doorbusters are still over a week away, both retailers are claiming “huge savings” for their online shoppers. A more comprehensive listing of the sale items can be found at BestBlackFriday.com, but here are the top deals for both sales. Disclaimer: The author, Phillip Dengler, is the owner of BestBlackFriday.com, which is referenced in this article. The Inquisitr holds no ownership. Walmart’s Pre-Black Friday Sale Walmart started offering early bird specials on their website a few weeks ago, and they have upgraded this sale to their official pre-Black Friday event. Here are some of the more important items included in the sale. Samsung 50″ 5000 Series HD LED TV for $397 (save $602.99) Samsung 55″ 6500 Series – Curved 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV for $697 (save $802.99) Dyson Light Ball Multifloor Bagless Upright Vacuum for $249 (save $140) Xbox One S 500GB with Your Choice of Bonus Game, 4k UltraHD Movie, and Controller (save up to $80.83) Pie Face Game for $12.99 (save $6.83) Keurig K50 Coffee Maker for $79 (save $10) RCA Voyager 7″ 16GB Tablet Android 6.0 for $34.98 (save $25.01) Acer Aspire E5-575-72L3 15.6″ Laptop for $449 (save $250) BouncePro 14′ Trampoline with Proflex Enclosure and Electron Shooter Game for $199 (save $120) KitchenAid Classic 4.5-Qt Stand Mixer, K45SS for $189 (save $60) Sceptre X405BV-F 40″ LED Class 1080P HDTV for $199.99 (save $200) Weslo Cadence G 5.9i Treadmill for $287 (save $212) Additionally, you can save up to $50 by opening a Walmart credit card account. Many of the items in the sale may go in and out of stock, so check back often for updates. How Does The Sale Compare To Walmart’s Black Friday Sale? .@Walmart's best #BlackFriday deals https://t.co/eeIoE4QEgq pic.twitter.com/pbn1jUgkwC — CNET (@CNET) November 14, 2016 As expected, the actual Walmart sale is the more diverse event. With over 600 items, it is going to be among the larger sales, and the prices on premium electronics are very competitive. One of the featured deals in the current pre-Black Friday sale is a 500 GB Xbox One S Bundle with the choice of a bonus game, a movie, and an extra controller for $299 to $487.97. The final price will depend on your selections, but you can save up to $80.83. On Black Friday, Walmart will be offering the Xbox One S White 500GB Battlefield Bundle for $249, which is a discount of $50. While it will be cheaper to get an Xbox One S if you wait until Black Friday, the current bundle may be better for your individual needs. The pre-Black Friday event is also selling the Proscan PLDED4017 40″ 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV for $169.99, which is a discount of $80. On Black Friday, you will be able to purchase an Element or Hisense 40″ LED 1080p HDTV for $125. In this scenario, it is most likely better to wait until next week to purchase a television of this size. Both sets are comparable, but there is a premium to pay for getting it early. Walmart’s actual Black Friday sale is scheduled to begin on Thanksgiving at 6 p.m. Online doorbusters should be available the entire day on Thanksgiving, but there is a chance that select doorbusters go on sale on Wednesday night. In order to compare more of the items and prices in both sales, you can view the entire 34-page Walmart Black Friday 2016 ad at Savings.com. Sears’ Pre-Black Friday Sale For a limited time, Sears is holding their “Black Friday Now” sale on their website. It includes over 600 items, many of which are featured doorbusters, and it is only available online. Here are some of the more important items included in the sale. Craftsman 22″ 179cc Compact Dual-Stage Snowblower for $399.99 (save $300) NordicTrack Elite 10.9 Elliptical for $599.99 (save $1,000) Christmas Outdoor Decor for 30 Percent Off Craftsman 24V Max* Li-Ion 10″ Cordless Chainsaw for $79.99 (save $80) Samsung LED 19″ HDTV 720p 60Hz for $127.99 (save $12) Samsung 40″ Class Smart LED TV for $277.99 (save $172) Samsung 55″ Class 4K Smart UHD Curved TV for $697.99 (save $402) Samsung DV45H7000EW 7.4 cu. ft. Electric Dryer for $447.79 (save $252.20) Samsung WA45H7000AW 4.5 cu. ft. Top-Load Washer for $447.79 (save $252.20) Free shipping is available on all orders of $49 or more. Additionally, members can earn up to 100 percent back in points on certain items. How Does The Sale Compare To Sears’ Black Friday Sale? Before you even get the turkey you can start shopping BLACK FRIDAY pricing! Get special early savings right now! https://t.co/suWyqu2RIY pic.twitter.com/BWLyJAKLKx — Sears HometownStores (@SearsHTS) November 15, 2016 Similar to the pre-Black Friday sale at Walmart, the Sears version has the same general rules. Some of the items included are comparable to doorbuster pricing that will be available on Black Friday, but the best items are still a week away. One potentially better deal included in the Sears pre-Black Friday sale is a Samsung 40 Class LED Smart TV for $277.99. This TV normally retails for $449.99, so it is savings of $172. On Black Friday, Sears will sell a Samsung 40″ Smart 1080p LED HDTV for $249.99, and the savings is only $150. While you will have to pay more for the deal that is live now, the overall savings are better. In order to compare more of the items and prices in both sales, you can view the entire 48-page Sears Black Friday 2016 ad at Savings.com. As with the Walmart pre-Black Friday sale, items in the Sears pre-Black Friday sale may go in and out of stock.

Here's how the company hopes it will pay off. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Nov 16, 2016 at 7:48PM Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is no one's idea of an innovator. For most of its recent history, the retail giant was known for its rapacious expansion, paying rock-bottom wages, and offering the lowest prices around. But that's changing now. Competition from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and, to a lesser extent, Costco Wholesale has forced Wal-Mart to rethink its longtime strategy. Image source: Wal-Mart.  Since CEO Doug McMillon took the helm in February 2014, the company has been fast adapting to the new retail landscape in order to keep up with competitors and changing customer habits. Let's take a look at a few of the major changes McMillon and Co. have made over the last year. 1. Raising wages  Wal-Mart sent shockwaves throughout the retail industry in early 2015 when it announced it would hike wages above the national minimum wage of $7.25. It raised its base wage to $9/hour in April 2015 and followed it up with another hike to $10/hour in February 2016. Wal-Mart also said it would invest in training to streamline promotions and reduce turnover.  Those wage hikes will cost the company $2.7 billion annually, but the decision appears to be paying off. Before it made the initial announcement, Wal-Mart's customer satisfaction was at the bottom of the industry, and it had poor internal store performance scores based on things like cleanliness and out-of-stocks. Now, the company is expected to report its ninth straight quarter of comparable sales growth this week -- a streak that did not start until McMillon took control -- and its second-quarter comp of 1.6% was its best in several years. 2. Acquiring Jet.com Perhaps the biggest change Wal-Mart made this year was buying e-commerce start-up Jet.com for $3.3 billion, a record sum for an American e-commerce company. More than obtaining ownership of Jet.com itself, Wal-Mart seemed to be most interested in overhauling its own e-commerce operation, which it can now do with the help of Jet's "smart basket" algorithm, which gives customers the ability to lower prices, and with access to the mind of Jet.com Founder Marc Lore.    Wal-Mart pursued Lore's first company, Diapers.com parent Quidsi, but lost in a bidding war to Amazon in 2010. Lore spent two years at Amazon before leaving to start Jet.com, and he has now committed to spending five years at Wal-Mart.  Already, he is putting his stamp on the retail giant; it recently announced that several e-commerce executives would be leaving the company, and it lifted its online inventory from 8 million items to more than 20 million. With those changes and the expansion of its grocery pickup program, management expects online sales growth to accelerate to 20%-30% in the second half of the year, from just 8% in the first quarter.  3. Slowing down new store growth Wal-Mart plans to open just 59 new stores next year, which marks its slowest store expansion this century. Of those 59 stores, 20 will be Neighborhood Markets, the grocery-only stores that average about 40,000 square feet, four will be Sam's Clubs, and 35 will be Supercenters, some of which are conversions from Discount Stores, which lack a full grocery.  The plan is a marked divergence from Wal-Mart's historic strategy of blanketing the country with stores. With more than 5,000 locations including Sam's Clubs nationwide, Wal-Mart claims it has a store within five miles of 70% of the U.S. population. In other words, the marginal benefit of further penetrating the country has fallen, and the company can instead use its existing store network as a platform for e-commerce and to grow profits through increased same-store sales. Scaling back on new store openings allows the company to spend more money cleaning and improving stores and expand its grocery pickup program.  With Amazon shaping up as its principal rival, Wal-Mart is best off investing to attract customers to its existing stores and improve its e-commerce platform. Though the company sees flat profit growth next year after a decline this year, these moves are helping it become more competitive for the long term, which will ultimately benefit investors.

Menu Home Events Library Jobs Topics Newsletter Search Technology Trends Marketing E-commerce Payments Logistics Corporate News Loss Prevention Holidays Brief Wal-Mart denies urging workers not to download labor group app Author By Daphne Howland @daphnehowland • Published Nov. 16, 2016 Dive Brief: In an email to Retail Dive, Wal-Mart denied reports that it is discouraging employees from downloading WorkIt, an application developed by workers advocacy group OUR Walmart that employs IBM’s artificial intelligence bot Watson to answer questions about the retail giant's labor policies. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Wal-Mart is urging workers against using the WorkIt app, which leverages Watson machine learning tools to help employees better understand their benefits, rights and other labor issues. According to a internal Wal-Mart memo acquired by The Wall Street Journal, store managers contend that OUR Walmart (which is not officially a labor union) is “increasingly trying to get our associates to turn over personal information to the union by using deceptive and slick-looking social media and mobile app.” Dive Insight: In an email to Retail Dive, Wal-Mart Stores said employees can choose for themselves whether to use WorkIt, but want to be sure they realize it’s not an official Wal-Mart app, and that Wal-Mart has its own WalmartOne app for accessing company resources, employee information and social interaction tools. “This is a very busy time of year for our associates and they are receiving a lot of information from a lot of different sources,” Wal-Mart spokesperson Kory Lundberg said. “While they are focused on delivering a great holiday experience for our customers we want to make sure they know this app is not affiliated with Walmart. Our associates already have anytime-access online to the company’s most current and accurate Paid Time Off policies and there is no way to know if the details this group is pushing are correct.” Wal-Mart also said the WorkIt app poses potential privacy issues for workers. “Our people are smart and see this for what it is, an attempt by an outside group to collect as much personal and private information as possible,” Lundberg told Retail Dive. His statement didn't not address the internal memo obtained by The Wall Street Journal, however. OUR Walmart admits it is keen on amassing data about Wal-Mart’s policies and workers’ experiences, but notes that users of the WorkIt app can sign in anonymously; only their handpicked usernames are visible. In addition, there's no sharing of contacts or location data, and photo sharing is optional. (OUR Walmart developed WorkIt in partnership with Quadrant 2, a New York City-based company that has designed software for companies and activist organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union, which has worked to increase online privacy and transparency.) "Because [WorkIt is] an app from an outside group, people won't know what data and private information they collect or how they plan to use it," Lundgren said. "The WalmartOne app does not track people's social interaction — it connects people to the WalmartOne site, which works like any other social site — people can post new topics, comment on anything on the site, etc." Still, it's a rare app that doesn't collect information from users; usually it's a question of how upfront a company, organization or developer is about what exactly that entails. As of press time, Wal-Mart has not disclosed to Retail Dive whether WalmartOne collects user information in any way.

Ten days later, Microsoft made its largest wind-power purchase agreement ever, with a deal to buy 237 megawatts of electricity from turbines in Kansas and Wyoming to run data centers in Cheyenne. In between those announcements, Donald Trump was elected president, in part by calling climate change a hoax and vowing to gut most of Obama’s clean-energy policies and revive coal mining. If the actions of Walmart and Microsoft are any indication, a Trump administration will do little to dissuade companies from continuing to invest in renewables. “I think fears of a negative impact of Trump on renewable energy are really overblown,” says Thomas Emmons, a partner at Pegasus Capital Advisors, a private asset management firm focused on sustainable and alternative investments. One reason is timing. The biggest economic incentives for clean energy are federal tax credits for solar and wind projects. Both were set to expire at the end of last year, prompting a surge in investments as companies raced to get in under the deadline. In December, Congress unexpectedly extended both credits (for solar until 2021 and for wind until 2019) as part of a deal to lift the 40-year-old ban on U.S. oil exports. It’s not clear that Trump will try to persuade Congress to repeal the extensions. Wind power is especially popular across the Midwest, a Republican stronghold; in many cases it’s become cheaper than other sources of grid power. Sixty percent of Fortune 100 companies have renewable-electricity or climate change policies, and 81 companies globally have committed to get 100 percent of their energy from renewable sources, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Companies tend to invest in renewable energy in one of three ways: sourcing clean power from wind and solar projects through long-term agreements; purchasing a stake in green power projects; or using renewable-energy credits to offset the dirtier power they consume. Since 2008, U.S. companies have signed agreements to purchase more than $10 billion worth of wind and solar power— about 10Gw, enough to run almost 2 million U.S. households for a year. BNEF expects that pace to increase over the next decade, with at least 50 U.S. companies signing long-term agreements to buy an additional 22Gw of clean energy. “A Trump presidency does not lower our expectations for the growth of the corporate renewable-energy market,” says Nathan Serota, a clean-energy analyst at BNEF. “If anything, a less ambitious stance on renewables at the federal level could encourage corporations to pick up the slack even further.” With the government providing less support, more businesses may decide the best way to ensure clean-power projects get built is to sign long-term purchase agreements. That way, renewable developers have a guaranteed customer, ensuring they can finance new projects. These agreements are emerging as the preferred way to invest in clean energy. Locking in electricity prices for up to 15 years, the deals let companies hedge exposure to volatile natural gas and coal prices, which have historically determined wholesale power prices in the U.S. As wind and solar get cheaper, companies are able to lock in renewable power for less than the average wholesale power price, says Swami Venkataraman, senior vice president at Moody’s Investors Service. “Companies are investing in sustainability, not because they’re making a political statement, but because they have a fiduciary duty to protect shareholders and make money,” says Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a nonprofit sustainability advocate. Even if Trump rolls back Obama’s commitment to the Paris climate accord and his signature clean-energy initiative, the Clean Power Plan (CPP), which directs states to lower carbon emissions from power plants, it’s unlikely to influence investment decisions. “Renewable developers weren’t building a business model premised on the CPP,” Serota says. On Nov. 16, 300 U.S. businesses, including General Mills, EBay, and Intel, called on Trump to support the Paris accord. “The sustainable investing trend has global momentum and big players such as Goldman Sachs and Bill Gates,” said Amy Myers Jaffe, executive director for energy and sustainability at the University of California at Davis, in an e-mail. “Corporate America has lots of millennial customers, and they want to buy from companies with sustainable supply chains and a commitment to renewable energy. I don’t see that changing.” The bottom line: Companies should continue investing in renewables despite Trump’s promise to roll back clean-energy initiatives.

Here's how the company hopes it will pay off. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Nov 16, 2016 at 7:48PM Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is no one's idea of an innovator. For most of its recent history, the retail giant was known for its rapacious expansion, paying rock-bottom wages, and offering the lowest prices around. But that's changing now. Competition from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and, to a lesser extent, Costco Wholesale has forced Wal-Mart to rethink its longtime strategy. Image source: Wal-Mart.  Since CEO Doug McMillon took the helm in February 2014, the company has been fast adapting to the new retail landscape in order to keep up with competitors and changing customer habits. Let's take a look at a few of the major changes McMillon and Co. have made over the last year. 1. Raising wages  Wal-Mart sent shockwaves throughout the retail industry in early 2015 when it announced it would hike wages above the national minimum wage of $7.25. It raised its base wage to $9/hour in April 2015 and followed it up with another hike to $10/hour in February 2016. Wal-Mart also said it would invest in training to streamline promotions and reduce turnover.  Those wage hikes will cost the company $2.7 billion annually, but the decision appears to be paying off. Before it made the initial announcement, Wal-Mart's customer satisfaction was at the bottom of the industry, and it had poor internal store performance scores based on things like cleanliness and out-of-stocks. Now, the company is expected to report its ninth straight quarter of comparable sales growth this week -- a streak that did not start until McMillon took control -- and its second-quarter comp of 1.6% was its best in several years. 2. Acquiring Jet.com Perhaps the biggest change Wal-Mart made this year was buying e-commerce start-up Jet.com for $3.3 billion, a record sum for an American e-commerce company. More than obtaining ownership of Jet.com itself, Wal-Mart seemed to be most interested in overhauling its own e-commerce operation, which it can now do with the help of Jet's "smart basket" algorithm, which gives customers the ability to lower prices, and with access to the mind of Jet.com Founder Marc Lore.    Wal-Mart pursued Lore's first company, Diapers.com parent Quidsi, but lost in a bidding war to Amazon in 2010. Lore spent two years at Amazon before leaving to start Jet.com, and he has now committed to spending five years at Wal-Mart.  Already, he is putting his stamp on the retail giant; it recently announced that several e-commerce executives would be leaving the company, and it lifted its online inventory from 8 million items to more than 20 million. With those changes and the expansion of its grocery pickup program, management expects online sales growth to accelerate to 20%-30% in the second half of the year, from just 8% in the first quarter.  3. Slowing down new store growth Wal-Mart plans to open just 59 new stores next year, which marks its slowest store expansion this century. Of those 59 stores, 20 will be Neighborhood Markets, the grocery-only stores that average about 40,000 square feet, four will be Sam's Clubs, and 35 will be Supercenters, some of which are conversions from Discount Stores, which lack a full grocery.  The plan is a marked divergence from Wal-Mart's historic strategy of blanketing the country with stores. With more than 5,000 locations including Sam's Clubs nationwide, Wal-Mart claims it has a store within five miles of 70% of the U.S. population. In other words, the marginal benefit of further penetrating the country has fallen, and the company can instead use its existing store network as a platform for e-commerce and to grow profits through increased same-store sales. Scaling back on new store openings allows the company to spend more money cleaning and improving stores and expand its grocery pickup program.  With Amazon shaping up as its principal rival, Wal-Mart is best off investing to attract customers to its existing stores and improve its e-commerce platform. Though the company sees flat profit growth next year after a decline this year, these moves are helping it become more competitive for the long term, which will ultimately benefit investors.

Another man said he was entering his credit card number at checkout when the item suddenly showed up as sold out. The mini-replica of Nintendo’s original home console has 30 classic games built in and plugs directly into a high-definition TV using an included HDMI cable.

Denise Collier-Bailey told WTVR she just noticed two men sitting in the vestibule of the Short Pump superstore. It wasn't until she actually walked inside the store that her daughter asked, "Did you see that deer in the shopping cart?" Collier-Bailey had not, so she and her teenage daughter walked back out to get a closer look. The daughter took a photo. The gutted deer, was in the shopping cart, dripping blood on the floor, she said. "The things you see at Walmart!" she said in a phone interview Wednesday. "This just topped it all." Collier-Bailey said she did not bother the men and just went back into Walmart after taking the photos. "We were just... I couldn't believe it," Collier-Bailey said. Photo Gallery View Gallery (2 images) Walmart spokesman Charles Krowson confirmed the incident. He said a customer alerted store management and a manager quickly told the men to take their deer and go. Krowson did not know why the men rolled the dead deer into Walmart, but made it clear the carcass never made it into the shopping areas of the store. Lee Walker, with the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, speculated the men might be hunters simply trying to follow Virginia law. "It appears that they were trying to follow the law by checking in the harvested deer, but were not at an approved check station," Walker said. "In most cases hunters do not bring harvested game actually into an approved checked station, but rather have someone from the store come out to verify the harvest and to record the needed information."

WorkIt is a free app in which users can get advice on workplace rights and policies. The advisors on the app, which was released Monday, are current and for Wal-Mart workers. On WorkIt, users can ask questions anonymously or as a registered user through the app, see common questions among workers and talk to others through a secure chat and group chats. WorkIt also notifies workers on updates about the workplace. WorkIt app for Walmart workers. Photo: WorkIt WorkIt app for Walmart workers. Photo: WorkIt But Wal-Mart is not too fond of the app. The corporation alerted its store managers to tell their workers that WorkIt was not developed by the company, and that it was a scheme to get employees’ personal information, according to the Wall Street Journal. Related Stories Walmart Buying Jet.com For $3B Walmart, Target, Kohl's Offer Black Friday Deals Wal-Mart said the worker group is “increasingly trying to get our associates to turn over personal information to the union by using deceptive and slick looking social media and mobile apps,” according to a document obtained by the Journal . “There is no way to know if the details this group is pushing are correct,” Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg told the Wall Street Journal in an email. “Our people are smart and see this for what it is: an attempt by an outside group to collect as much personal and private information as possible.” OUR Walmart has previously organized Black Friday protests at Wal-Mart. The non-profit was previously part of United Food and Commercial Workers International, which has tried, without any luck, to organize employees at U.S. Wal-Mart stores. Meanwhile, the company has been strongly resisting against union activity in its stores. Before the app was released, workers found other means of communication over the workplace at Wal-Mart stores. Employees share their experiences and concerns via Facebook, Reddit and other sites. However, OUR Walmart says those conversations may lead to incorrect answers.

One of these two is just too darn expensive. Brian Stoffel (TMFCheesehead) Nov 16, 2016 at 2:06PM Image source: Getty Images. This is a classic battle of a disruptor getting disrupted. Back when Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) was founded in 1962, there were no giants supplying affordable goods in bulk to rural communities across America. That was the opportunity that Sam Walton seized. But over time, the disruptor became the stalwart. People started to complain about how the company treated both its employees and its suppliers. And then came founder Jim Senegal and Costco (NASDAQ:COST), which -- while much smaller -- is using a membership-based program to turn Wal-Mart on its head, providing industry-leading benefits to employees and satisfying customers at the same time. Of course, now both are being challenged by e-commerce behemoth Amazon.com. But the question for today's article is both simple and impossible to definitively answer: Between Wal-Mart and Costco, which is the better stock to buy? Here are three lenses through which we can view the question. Financial fortitude This may sound boring, but how much cash a company has in the bank -- and how much it owes to debtors -- can be a huge deal if/when macro or company-specific troubles arise. Think about it: In a downturn, companies that have cash have options. They can outspend rivals, acquire rivals, buy back their stock, or continue paying a dividend without batting an eye. Companies with lots of debt are in the opposite boat: forced to narrow their focus just to make ends meet -- while losing sight of the grander purpose that they believe they can accomplish. Here's how Costco and Wal-Mart stack up in terms of financial fortitude: Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Costco $4.7 billion $5.5 billion $2.4 billion $643 million Wal-Mart $7.7 billion $48.1 billion $14.7 billion $21.2 billion Data source: Yahoo! Finance. To be honest with you, neither of these companies is particularly impressive. On the one hand, Wal-Mart has a boatload of debt. That's not too big of a deal given the prodigious amounts of free cash flow (FCF) that it produces, but it's still a higher number than I'm comfortable with. On the other hand, Costco's FCF leaves a lot to be desired. That's mostly because the company uses its cash generated from operations to help build new stores -- 31 of which are expected to be opened during the current fiscal year. I'm glad the company doesn't have to use debt to do this, but it means that it has been paying out more in dividends ($746 million) than it has from FCF. That's not a sustainable strategy. In the end, I'm calling this a tie -- with a thumbs-down for both companies. Winner: Tie Sustainable competitive advantage In investing circles, a sustainable competitive advantage is often referred to as a moat. In its most basic form, a company's moat is what makes it special, what separates it from the rest of the pack, and what will help it continue to be the provider of choice for (in this case) consumer goods shoppers. Wal-Mart's moat comes primarily from the size of its network. With over 11,500 stores in 28 countries operating under an amazing 63 different banners, Wal-Mart is one of the most ubiquitous shopping destinations worldwide. This type of scale allows the company to bargain hard for low prices for customers, which is usually an enticing way to keep them coming back. Costco's moat, on the other hand, is its membership-based business model. The prices for bulk goods at Costco are so low that membership fees are the only way that the company actually turns a profit. After all other expenses are taken into consideration, Costco would actually run at a loss without these fees ! Members know they can't get these deals anywhere else, and there really isn't a serious threat from any other nationwide membership warehouse either. At the end of the day, I'd say both of these companies have medium-level moats. Winner: Tie Valuation Finally, we have the question of how expensive each stock is. There's no "perfect" way to measure this, so I think it's worth exploring a number of data points. Here are four of my favorites. Company P/E P/FCF P/S PEG Ratio Costco 28 103 0.6 2.5 Wal-Mart 16 10 0.5 5.0 Data source: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade, YCharts. P/E figures reflect non-GAAP EPS. While both of these companies sport very high price-to-earnings-growth (PEG) ratios, there's a clear winner in my mind: Wal-Mart. While the company's days of heady growth are no doubt in the past, it produces a ton of cash flow, and trades for just 10 FCF. Because Costco is busy building out its network, it trades for 10 times that valuation. Winner: Wal-Mart Final call: Wal-Mart There you have it. While I personally prefer Costco as a company to Wal-Mart, I think that Wal-Mart's stock is a better choice right now. More than anything else, I think Costco is just too expensive when all is said and done.  Brian Stoffel owns shares of Amazon.com.

Read today's eNewspaper News Maryland Baltimore County Towson Pigging out: Halloween castoffs gathered by volunteers to help feed neglected potbellied pigs Pigs Eat Pumpkins Pigs eat donated pumpkin at Whispering Rise Farm & Animal Sanctuary in Freeland, MD on Wednesday, November 9, 2016.  Video by Jen Rynda/ Baltimore Sun Media Group  Pigs eat donated pumpkin at Whispering Rise Farm & Animal Sanctuary in Freeland, MD on Wednesday, November 9, 2016.  Video by Jen Rynda/ Baltimore Sun Media Group  Nelson CoffinTowson Times Lutherville woman is dedicated to improving the welfare of neglected potbellied pigs While her neighbors and a local Walmart are mainly responsible for the heaping mounds of pumpkins that recently piled up on Chris Shaughness' driveway, the Lutherville resident's only response is to ask for more. That way, she will have plenty of treats to take to the homeless potbellied pigs at the six-acre Whispering Rise Farm and Animal Sanctuary, in Freeland, where Shaughness volunteers three times a week. "I like to just go out there and sit around and hang out with the pigs," said Shaughness, an avowed supporter of animal rights who currently shares her home with a blind 10-year-old dog, Fritzie, the 12th foster dog she has adopted. "They love pumpkins," Shaughness said of the pigs. "Pumpkins are a real treat for them." That's why she decided to post a request on nextdoor.com for her neighbors to donate their vegetable Halloween decorations, which often have been carved into jack-o'-lanterns. "The real story is how the neighbors came together to do this," Shaughness said. "At first, people dropped off 20 pumpkins. And then there were another 20. And then another 40." Lutherville resident Chris Shaughness and volunteers feed pigs donated pumpkins at Whispering Rise Farm & Animal Sanctuary in Freeland, MD on Wednesday, November 9, 2016. (Staff Photos by Jen Rynda) Shaughness, a Notre Dame Preparatory School and Loyola College (now Loyola University Maryland) alum, said she has collected more than 100 of the orange gourds to feed her porcine pals. About half of the total can be attributed to Brenda Foulke, who read Shaughness' online plea for pumpkins. Foulke not only brought two pumpkins to Shaughness' home, the real estate agent from Ruxton also inquired at a Walmart near her office in White Marsh to see if the store's management would like to get rid of its bumper crop of gourds while helping a good cause. "I was walking through the store and I saw all these pumpkins," she said. "I asked a store manager if they would donate some of the pumpkins. She said 'yes,' but she also said she needed them to be moved right away. So I filled up my SUV with as many pumpkins as I could fit, and took them to Chris' house, which is only about a mile from my place." "Chris is a loving and caring person," Foulke added. "My goal was to get at least one pumpkin for each pig." 'They're very loveable' Whispering Rise Farm's owner, Jeff Lambert, operates the sanctuary with the help of Shaughness and 19 other regular or occasional volunteers, who are dedicated to the welfare of the pigs, which live in five separate herds on the farm. The animals are grouped by age, origin, tenure and temperament, isolating newcomers from more established factions until a determination of where they best fit in is established. Because neither the Baltimore Humane Society nor the Maryland Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals deal with pigs and their predicaments, Lambert regularly is inundated with requests to add to his stock at Whispering Rise Farm and Animal Sanctuary. As stated on the nonprofit's website, its "mission is to provide sanctuary to abused, neglected, abandoned and surrendered potbelly pigs; to provide humane education to the public; and to offer an anthro-zoological experience to individuals and small groups." Shaughness spreads her affection equally among all the pigs. "Chris is a jewel," Lambert said. "She really connects with all the pigs, but is very good with special-needs pigs. If I ever need additional help on the farm, she's always willing to pitch in." Shaughness said that she first heard about Lambert's pig sanctuary at the Hereford Fall Festival and decided to take a look at the place for herself. She found that she likes the way Lambert operates the farm. "I always wanted to have an animal sanctuary," said Lambert, a former child welfare social worker who ran group homes in Baltimore city and Howard County. "On a trip to Utah, to visit an animal sanctuary, I fell in love with potbellied pigs." Lambert said that part of the pig's appeal is that they require less infrastructure and can live outside year-round in this region. Goats go green by eating invasive plants and vines in Towson area Larry Perl Jack was in goat heaven Oct. 7. He was up on his hind legs, happily eating the leaves off invasive vines in a wooded area near Baltimore Gas and Electric Co.'s East Towson substation at East Pennsylvania and Railroad avenues.

He was up on his hind legs, happily eating the leaves off invasive vines in a wooded area near Baltimore Gas and Electric Co.'s East Towson substation at East Pennsylvania and Railroad avenues. "We call this goat ballet," said Jack's owner, Veronica Cassilly, of... (Larry Perl) "It turned out to be good decision for me," he said of starting the nonprofit sanctuary in 2009 on land he and his wife, Bonnie, bought in 1994. In addition to food donations from supporters such as Shaughness and others, Lambert loads up to 150 pounds of produce at the Hunt Valley Wegman's grocery and brings it back to the farm three times a week. "We give them produce three times per week that's not quite sellable," said Dave Giuliano, the store's service manager. "It's almost 10,000 pounds per year." The pigs "know when they're about to be fed," said Lambert, who jokingly referred to himself as a pig whisperer. "That's when all the squealing begins." Despite not having any previous experience with the animals, Shaughness said she found the pigs to be very likable and smart. "They can do anything a dog can do," she said. "They're very lovable." Homeless pets The pigs are homeless mainly because people don't do the proper research before buying the animals to be pets, she said. That, in turn, leads to the pets being abandoned or turned into animal shelters or rescue agencies, prompting calls to Whispering Rise Farm to see if there is room for more pigs. From there, the pigs will live out their days on the farm or be placed with another family. A cute baby potbellied pig will eventually grow to be between 60 to 175 pounds with a life expectancy of 12 to 15 years, making ownership more difficult for the unprepared. Shaughness said she grew up in Timonium with two siblings in an animal-loving family. For her, though, the loss of a beloved Golden Retriever intensified her feelings for animals to the point where she traded her longtime careers as an information technology specialist and telecommunications consultant for more pet-oriented endeavors. At first, she became a dog massage therapist and is now a certified behavior consultant and a dog trainer. Shaughness also is a volunteer for the Leadership in Animal Welfare Association and a volunteer district leader for the Humane Society of the United States, frequently spending time in Annapolis lobbying legislators when the General Assembly convenes in January. "My family thinks I'm nuts," she said, noting that she moved back home from the Philadelphia area 18 months ago to be closer to her 96-year-old mother, who lives in the Mercy Ridge Retirement Community, in Lutherville. "But it's in my soul, and you have to feel what's in your soul. That's what happens when you follow your passion."

CST November 15, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST A new smartphone app whose creators say they aim to educate Walmart employees about company policies has put the nation's biggest retailer at odds again with the labor group responsible for the app. WorkIt, which hit the Google Play store Monday, gives users information on workplace rights at Walmart. Questions entered in the WorkIt chat function are answered by current and ex-Walmart workers, but IBM Watson-powered artificial intelligence works in the background, too, and is expected to eventually answer queries more quickly. The group behind the app, OUR Walmart, also helped organize nationwide protests for better pay and working conditions at Walmart stores and at the retailer's Bentonville, Ark. headquarters in 2012 and 2013. The United Food & Commercial Workers International Union, which had attempted to unionize Walmart workers in the past, supported OUR Walmart in those efforts. The not-for-profit group split with the union last year. "OUR Walmart is not currently seeking to unionize Walmart," said co-director Dan Schlademan. "Our focus is to continue to build OUR Walmart and use collective action to create change at Walmart." The group started working on the app several months ago and launched it this week to make it easier for employees to access information about their workplace rights. Currently, employees say they must log onto a terminal at work to check company policies. Representatives from OUR Walmart say store supervisors are holding meetings to intimidate employees not to download it, according to two Walmart employees who are part of OUR Walmart. Right now, there are a lot of questions about Walmart's new paid time-off policy, making the smartphone app a draw, these employees said. "It is really hard to get time to access the computers at work to look things up," said Betsy Marler, a Walmart employee in Mobile, Ala. who is a member of OUR Walmart. "This puts it in your hand and you can use it any time you want to." Walmart has told its employees to be wary of the app because it is not software authorized by the company. “Our associates already have anytime-access online to the company’s most current and accurate Paid Time Off policies and there is no way to know if the details this group is pushing are correct," the company said in an email statement from Walmart spokesman Kory Lundberg. "Our people are smart and see this for what it is, an attempt by an outside group to collect as much personal and private information as possible.” Bloomberg reported on the WorkIt app Monday and The Wall Street Journal reported that Walmart had instructed managers to tell employees that WorkIt was not an official Walmart app and that it could result in unwanted sharing of personal information. Last year, Walmart raised worker wages after years of protests about employee compensation. And last month, the world's largest retailer gave raises to some managers in advance of new labor regulations on overtime pay. In the past, OUR Walmart's Facebook page has encouraged employees to connect there and has had about 100,000 employees who have participated in online conversations.  But that can lead to workers only getting part of the information, says Joanna Chambers, a Walmart employee in Amory, Miss., who is also part of OUR Walmart. "This is going to allow you to narrow it down specifically to you asking a question to somebody who can help you to that correct information," she said. Managers are worried that this app "is going to help associates connect with each other," Marler said. "They want to keep the power to themselves and they don’t want us empowered and to be able to access this on our own." Added Chambers, "at that point, we are no longer able to be manipulated." Walmart counters that it's not worried about workers connecting with each othe and says the company's WalmartOne website lets workers access company information, as well as paystubs and work schedules, and connect with coworkers. "There have been group discussions taking place on WalmartOne for more than a year where associates have the opportunity to pose questions and get accurate answers from inside the company," Lundberg says. More than one million associates access the site every month. As for the WorkIt app, he says "it’s up to associates to decide what they want to do with the app; we are just making sure they know this isn’t coming from the company and this group can do anything they want with someone’s personal information once they have it." OUR Walmart enlisted New York's Quadrant 2 to develop the app's software and licensed IBM's Watson artificial intelligence tech for the app. Employees said, 'We need someplace when I’m sitting at work and I’m facing a supervisor telling me this or somebody doing this to me, that I can get some advice on what to do'," said Schlademan. Walmart employee website doesn't include the whole 250-page policy manual, the group notes. Current or former Walmart employees volunteer to answer questions that users pose through the WorkIt app. Along the way, the Watson AI learns the questions and subsequent answers so eventually it "can give it that answer (more quickly)," Schlademan said. The app does ask for a worker's name, email, phone number and zip code; users can input their job title and Walmart store they work at, too. Beyond that, the app ask for access to the Internet and the device's camera should he or she want to add a profile picture. "It doesn't ask for location or contacts," he said. OUR Walmart plans to add more features to WorkIt -- an iOS version is expected before Black Friday -- and is making it available elsewhere, including among workers in Australia, he said.

You can reserve your router through Amazon, Best Buy, the Google Store and Walmart. Note you can either purchase a single router for $129, or a 3-pack for $299. Look for the Google Wifi to release on December 6.  Google has yet another router, but this time it's more affordable. Meet Google Wifi, which starts at just $129, significantly lower than Google's other, pricier line of OnHub routers. You'll be able to pre-order Google Wifi in November from the Google Store, Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart and the devices will ship in December. UK and Australia pricing have not been announced yet. So why did Google decide to release another router product when it already has OnHub? Whereas OnHub served as a single point of access to your home's wireless network, Google Wifi forms a mesh network using multiple routers to cover your entire home. Since you'll need multiple Google Wifi devices to take advantage of its mesh capabilities, Google will sell a 3-pack of Google Wifi discs for $299. "We launched the OnHub router last year to solve many of the everyday problems people encounter with home Wi-Fi," Google wrote in a blog post following Wifi's announcement. "With Google Wifi, we're building on that technology to create a system that provides seamless coverage for homes of any shape or size. OnHub and Google Wifi will work together, and we'll continue to add new features to all of our Wi-Fi devices via automatic updates." Strength in numbers If you already have an OnHub router, you can strengthen and extend the range of your network by adding on Google Wifi routers. The result is that you can move freely through your home and always have a solid connection, even when video chatting. Control your Google Wifi via an app on your phone One of Google Wifi's biggest selling points is its ease of use. Like the OnHub routers, Google Wifi intelligently analyzes your network quality and strength to offer you the best connection. For example, Google Wifi will constantly monitor network congestion and move devices to other channels for the fastest performance. Best of all, you can control Google Wifi via an app, making managing your home network a breeze. You won't need to navigate to a specialized site just to change a few settings like with traditional routers. Google Wifi supports Wireless AC1200 2x2, which means the router can maintain fast speeds by utilizing multiple channels simultaneously. Each router features 2 Gigabit Ethernet ports so you can have a wired connection for a faster, more reliable connection if needed. So far, Google Wifi looks like a great option for those who want consistent download speeds without the hassle of routine router management. However, we'll give you the full scoop when we get our hands on the router later this month. Looking for more ways to stay connected?

Target Best Sales For HDTVs, PS4, And Xbox One Bundles Shopping 3 0 0 November 15, 2016 Black Friday 2016 Deals: Walmart Vs. Target Best Sales For HDTVs, PS4, And Xbox One Bundles Matt Couden With new Black Friday 2016 ads being released by the day, there’s still no question that the Walmart and Target sales deals are the most scrutinized. These two stores will see hundreds of thousands of shoppers come through the doors for the Black Friday shopping extravaganza, while many millions more will be shopping the deals online. Knowing that, it seems best to take a look at the two retailers to see the “best of the best” when it comes to their deals in 2016. Both Walmart and Target tend to go for the “wow factor” in terms of their front page sales deals on their advertisements and this Black Friday season is no different. Large hi-definition televisions, video game systems, and other electronics are normally featured as special “doorbuster” deals that customers can only snatch up if they are lucky. It usually means getting into the store super early, or being able to be online when the particular items are still in stock and available for order at the reduced prices. For this year’s sales, both stores are offering a great deal on a large HDTV. However, it really will depend on a customer’s preference. As Brad’s Deals notes, one of Target’s top deals is the Hisense 50-inch Smart 4K UHDTV for just $249.99. It’s considered one of the lowest prices seen on a television of this type and size. However, keep in mind that there are other details to consider once the item box is seen. These include looking at how many HDMI ports the TV has, as well as the lack of other key features that some discerning customers may want to skip. Walmart and Target will offer some enticing HDTV deals this season. [Image by Allison Joyce/Getty Images] Walmart is right there with Target and attempting to do them one better. Among Walmart’s top 10 deals is a Phillips 55-inch 4K UHD Smart TV at a price of $298.00. That’s five inches larger and about $50 more than Target’s deal, and it’s considered a more known household brand. It also indicates it has 3 HDMI ports, which is something that the Target deal specifics lack right now. Remember, getting to the store early for the doorbuster is the best way to snag this deal. There are a handful of other television deals from both Walmart and Target’s Black Friday deals this year. There’s a Vizio 60-inch 1080p HDTV for $398 at Walmart. For a smaller screen, Target has an Element 43-inch 4K UHDTV for $199.99, while Walmart has a 40-inch Element or Hisense 1080p HDTV for just $125. There’s also a 32-inch Polaroid LED HDTV for a low $85 at Target, making for a great small TV gift for a college student. Right up there with HDTV sales, each Black Friday shopping season are also Black Friday video game system deals. The Microsoft Xbox One and Sony PlayStation 4 continue to be highly sought after by gamers who have yet to acquire these top-of-the-line systems. Target will offer a $249.99 Xbox One S bundle deal which includes the 500-gigabyte system along with Battlefield 1 or Minecraft and a $40 store gift card. Walmart will offer the same price on a PlayStation 4 Uncharted bundle which will include a $30 store gift card. With these deals, it will come down to which gaming system the gift recipient really wants, as there are fanboys out there for Microsoft and Sony’s products. Some gaming enthusiasts tend to love the look of graphics or the available titles on one system over the other. For Black Friday 2016, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 deals will be available. [Image by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images] When it comes down to it, both stores have some amazing prices featured in their Black Friday 2016 deals. However, it’s important to do early research into the items that are being offered. If at all possible, try to get the exact model and SKU numbers for the items being advertised and look deeper into the features that these items include. In addition to that, make sure to plan out the best way to get to the store early, even if it means camping out in line. Otherwise, the best way to go may be to take a chance online that the item will be available for order. Holiday shoppers, which Black Friday 2016 deals are you most interested in? Do you feel Walmart and Target have any deals that are “must haves” or is it better to wait for Cyber Monday sales?

(CSCO) Stock The market somewhat knew CSCO was shifting its approach By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Nov 18, 2016, 6:00 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: 10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in 2017 The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2016 Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is Just a One-Hit Wonder Recent Posts: Why Gap Inc (GPS), Hibbett Sports, Inc. (HIBB) and First Solar, Inc. (FSLR) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks 5 Retail Stocks That May Not Be Around Next Christmas Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF) Stock Is Beyond All Hope View All Posts Most of the headlines are tilted bullishly, suggesting Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is a buy today, with CSCO stock selling off to the tune of 5%. Those bullish calls are supported by rather sound arguments too, not the least of which implores investors to look beyond just one quarter. And yet, those headlines arguably oversimplify the uncertainty current and would-be owners of Cisco stock face today. On the one hand, the disappointing first fiscal quarter of 2017 doesn’t necessarily reflect the product/service mix that CSCO stock will be sporting a year or two from now. On the other hand, two key product categories showed decided weakness for the company last quarter, and there’s nothing Cisco can do to re-inflate demand on those fronts. Investors have a lot to think about here. Cisco Stock: A Tale of Transition For the quarter ending in October, CSCO earned 61 cents per share on revenue of $12.35 billion. Both figures topped analyst estimates for a bottom line of 59 cents per share of CSCO and sales of $12.33 billion. 7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Are Due for a Reckoning So why the sharp selloff from Cisco stock? It’s partly a response to the fact that the networking giant drove $12.68 billion in revenue for the same quarter a year earlier. It’s mostly the result, however, of a lackluster outlook and poor results from CSCO’s core business lines. Sales for its telecom service provider division were particularly poor, falling 12% on a year-over-year basis. Its switching business as a whole fell 7% during fiscal Q1. The lull represents a macro headwind, according to CEO Chuck Robbins, who explained that “[some customers have] just stopped spending as they tried to figure out what is going on in their business.” The macro headwind isn’t just in Robbins’ head either — others are seeing it too. Pacific Crest analysts Alex Kurtz and Steve Enders commented after Wednesday evening’s report: “Despite the setback in the U.S. service provider market, which appears unrelated to product or competitive positioning … we would see any material pullback in the stock as a buying opportunity.” The question is, how long will the macro headwind last? Nobody seems to know for sure. Needham Co analyst Alex Henderson thinks it’s going to persist for a few more quarters. Cisco at least partially obliged by forecasting a 2% to 4% revenue decline for the quarter currently underway. Either way, it’s a shift that’s been underway for longer than most CSCO stock investors recognize. The shift is also one of the key reasons Cisco has been moving toward a software and service-oriented business model that drives more recurring revenue. The company demonstrated progress on that front too. Last quarter, service revenue grew 7%, and security revenue was up 11%. CSCO aims to add cloud-computing management and security to its ‘campus’ portfolio of products within a year. The Real Problem With CSCO Stock It’s all a step in the right direction. As yesterday’s hardware functions are increasingly virtualized and technological leaps become more difficult to muster, Cisco must make that move to be competitive.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 18 November 2016 Ahold Delhaize profit misses estimates on US deflation AMSTERDAM: Royal Ahold Delhaize NV reported earnings below analysts’ estimates as the first results since a merger were overshadowed by the impact of deflation on the grocer’s Food Lion stores in the US. Underlying operating income rose 4.3% to 513 million euros (US$549mil) in the third quarter, the Zaandam, Netherlands-based owner of the US Stop & Shop chain said in a statement yesterday. Analysts expected 520 million euros. Sales growth in the US decelerated as rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc slashed prices. The stock fell as much as 3.8% in early trading in Amsterdam. “The US was slightly worse than anticipated, with a more difficult trading and deflationary environment,” ING analyst Matthias Maenhaut said. Ahold and Delhaize merged this year amid heightened competition in the US from supermarket giants such as Wal-Mart and from low-cost grocers in Europe. The combined company gets almost two-thirds of sales from the US, which has turned into its slowest-growing region. Chief executive officer Dick Boer said deflation won’t let up in that market in the fourth quarter. Shares of US supermarket operators dropped Wednesday after producer-price index data signalled that food deflation will continue to squeeze grocers’ profit. Using constant exchange rates, third-quarter sales growth in the US slowed to 2.4% at Ahold and 1.1% at Delhaize. The company forecast full-year profitability slightly ahead of last year’s, when the underlying operating margin was 3.5%. That margin widened to 3.6% from 3.4% in the first nine months of the year. “The outlook is not very engaging,” wrote Antoine Parison, an analyst at Bryan Garnier & Co. – Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Ahold , earnings , merger , Food Lion Related Stories CIMB’s results broadly within expectations Dayang back in the black in Q3 on lower one-off expenses SP Setia to see stronger earnings ahead ArcelorMittal sees weak last quarter AmInvestment: Axiata Group results could be below expectations You May Be Interested The gig economy only a stopgap measure to our woes Nationwide takes the Express to catch up SC announces new appointments Daibochi bullish on Myanmar venture PNB unit trust funds hit 210.63 billion units as of October Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read China wants fewer, but better, electric car makers Tourists now prefer lodgings with Airbnb flavour, hoteliers told Fundraising walk sets new record Property Related advertisement Latest News A ‘Yan’ to be the best Inevitable, essential failure Reflections on Budget 2017 Briefs Too premature to make final decision on TPP, says Mustapa Most Viewed in Business Governor: Bank Negara won’t tolerate ringgit transactions in NDF market PNB unit trust funds hit 210.63 billion units as of October Too premature to make final decision on TPP, says Mustapa advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen emphasised that the Fed plans to raise interest rates, which will help banks make more money from lending. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments Stocks started the day with small gains and moved higher following Ms Yellen's testimony to Congress. Banks once again marched higher as investors cheered the latest indication that interest rates will rise from their current ultra-low levels. Retailers also rose after strong earnings from Best Buy, while food and household goods makers struggled after weak results from Wal-Mart and JM Smucker. Almost all of the S&P 500's gains since the presidential election have gone to financial stocks. They lagged the market for much of this year, but they are now trading at their highest levels since May 2008, months before the financial crisis peaked. Investors hope banks will benefit from higher interest rates, faster economic growth and lighter regulation under President-elect Donald Trump. "I wouldn't expect we're going to see the entire repeal of Dodd-Frank, but we could certainly see some changes that are positive for the financial services sector," said Kate Warne, an investment strategist for Edward Jones. The Dow Jones industrial average added 35.68 points, or 0.2%, to 18,903.82. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 10.18 points, or 0.5%, to 2,187.12. The Nasdaq composite added 39.39 points, or 0.7%, to 5,333.97. The Dow has set several records since the election, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are close to records they set a few months ago. Ms Yellen told Congress that the economy is improving and added that that if the Fed keeps waiting now and raises rates too quickly later, that increases the risk of a recession. Investors already expected the Fed to raise interest rates when it meets in mid-December, and they felt Ms Yellen's comments confirmed that higher rates are coming. Bond prices slipped. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rose to 2.29% from 2.22%. Bond yields rise when investors expect higher interest rates and inflation. Bank of America gained 33 cents, or 1.7%, to 20.08 dollars and PNC Financial Services climbed 3.09 dollars, or 2.9%, to 110.60 dollars. Greater sales of mobile phones and increased online sales helped electronics retailer Best Buy post a strong third quarter, and the company forecast a larger fourth-quarter profit than analysts had expected. Its stock climbed 5.54 dollars, or 13.7%, to 45.99 dollars and hit a six-year high. Other retailers also rose. Home Depot recovered some recent losses and added 3.60 dollars, or 2.9%, to 128.93 dollars. Amazon also gained ground as Wal-Mart struggled. It picked up 9.91 dollars, or 1.3%, to 756.40 dollars. "Instead of spending in traditional ways, consumers have decided to spend their additional dollars in technology and online shopping," Ms Warne said. Wal-Mart announced disappointing sales in its third quarter. The retailer's profit also fell as it invested more money in its stores and its online business. The stock lost 2.20 dollars, or 3.1%, to 69.19 dollars. Warehouse club operator Costco and grocery store chain Kroger both took small losses as well. Jam and jellies maker JM Smucker disclosed weak sales and its stock shed 5.10 dollars, or 3.9%, to 124.85 dollars. Tyson Foods fell 2.32 dollars, or 3.4%, to 66.70 dollars. Cisco Systems fell after its earnings forecast disappointed Wall Street. The seller of routers, switches, software and services forecast a smaller-than-expected profit for its second fiscal quarter. That cancelled out a strong first-quarter report. The stock gave up 1.52 dollars, or 4.8%, to 30.05 dollars. Oil refining company Tesoro will buy Western Refining for 37.30 dollars a share in stock, a deal the companies valued at 4.1 billion dollars. The stock closed at 30.50 dollars on Wednesday, and it jumped 7.05 dollars, or 23.1%, to 37.55 dollars. Tesoro shares rose 82 cents, or 1%, to 86.56 dollars. Higher interest rates also mean a stronger dollar. The dollar climbed to 109.89 yen from 109.15 yen. The euro fell to 1.0626 dollars from 1.0681 dollars. The ICE US dollar index continued to rise. It is at its highest level in 13 years. Oil prices gave up a small gain and turned lower. Benchmark US crude slid 15 cents to 45.42 dollars a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slipped 14 cents to 46.49 dollars a barrel in London. Energy companies lagged the market after big gains earlier this week. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose two cents to 1.34 dollars a gallon. Heating oil rose one cent to 1.45 dollars a gallon. Natural gas fell six cents, or 2.2%, to 2.70 dollars per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell seven dollars to 1,216.90 dollars an ounce and silver lost 16 cents to 16.77 dollars an ounce. Copper rose two cents to 2.49 dollars a pound. The FTSE 100 index added 0.7% and the CAC 40 in France rose 0.6%. Germany's DAX gained 0.2%. Japan's Nikkei 225 barely moved and the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong eased 0.1%. The Kospi in South Korea inched higher.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Deer hunting the old fashioned way Thursday Nov 17, 2016 at 3:28 PM Nov 17, 2016 at 3:28 PM Steve Gilliland / Outdoors Columnist Sometimes as I conjure up "OK Google" or check Fox News or the 7 day weather forecast on my smart phone, all while sitting in the Walmart parking lot, I wonder how we ever survived with phones that were only made to talk on. Then it hits me; we survived quite well, thank you very much. The other day I went to fill the deer feeder in the draw below our high-rise deer blind which we constructed three years ago. As I rounded the corner on the gravel road and the blind came into view, so did several hundred thousand dollars of excavating equipment rebuilding the terraces and forming new waterways in the fields that surround our blind. Just in case it looks as though our deer hunting could be permanently interrupted there this year, I scouted out another property on which we have deer hunting permission. In front of that property is a wheat field that’s traveled frequently by deer heading for the pond and trees on the property. I found a spot in a sharp corner of the field where it appears deer are jumping the fence and entering the small woodlot. There is no blind built there and no good spot to set up a temporary blind to overlook that corner. The best option appears to be the overhanging limbs of a cedar tree seventy yards away. As I broke into a cold sweat, wondering aloud how I would ever survive not having a blind to hunt from, it suddenly hit me; I have harvested more deer from a folding camp chair tucked beneath a cedar tree than from any other way, and again, I have survived quite well, thank you very much. For those of you new to deer hunting that don’t have a blind from which to hunt, or for those of you wanting to try hunting deer for the first time but are not sure how to proceed without a blind, let me give you some tips from my experience. Mr. Webster defines the word camouflage as "a disguise or deception; to disguise in order to conceal." Camouflage does not have to make something or someone entirely disappear, it just has to make them blend in, and it does that by breaking up their outline. Examples of that would be sitting against a tree or sitting behind or under some broken overhanging limbs. Both choices camouflage you by breaking up the outline of your body. Joyce harvested her first deer ever as she sat on a camp chair behind a log in a big thick tree row. My point is that in the absence of a blind of some description, nature will provide you everything you need if you just learn to see it. The most important element of hunting is to position yourself where there is game. So when deciding upon a deer hunting location, choose a spot near a well used deer trail, where deer enter and exit a woodlot etc. If you’re bow hunting, you want to be as close to the trail as possible, but if rifle hunting choose a spot away from the trail seventy-five to a hundred yards or so. Then pay attention to where the sun will be in relation to you. You do not want the sun shining directly on you or in your eyes when it rises or sets, making it hard to see ahead of you as it shines into your eyes or lighting you up like a Christmas tree as it shines on you. Next, look around you for anything that will conceal your form, like a broken-over or uprooted tree, a tree with large broken limbs that hang to the ground or a big cedar tree with long outstretched branches. Once you have found a natural blind, figure out how best to use it. Prune and remove limbs and branches until you can tuck yourself into whatever concealment you’ve chosen. Prune away only enough to allow you entrance and to give yourself an open shooting lane. Use your imagination and move limbs and branches around if necessary to accomplish what you need. If you are firearm hunting, find a way to support your firearm. If none exists naturally in your new natural blind, a couple 1x2’s bolted together near one end opens up into an "x" to make a cheap and dandy shooting stick to cradle your gun. Your seat can be whatever you want. If you’re young you can probably get away with sitting on a log, but my choice is a cheap folding camp chair that gives me a back to lean against. It’s not always possible, but choosing to tuck yourself in amongst the branches of a big cedar tree will often help protect you from the north and west wind also. There are still plenty of ways to conceal yourself to harvest a Kansas deer without a hunting blind or tree stand. Be creative; tree limbs stacked against a fence, a piece of camouflage fabric stretched around some fence posts, even digging yourself down into an old round hay bale at the edge of a field will all fill the bill. The end result might even be more fulfilling knowing you used what God provided to fill your freezer. Continue to Explore Kansas Outdoors!

Nov 17, 2016 — by Zach Hirsch (Plattsburgh Correspondent) , in Plattsburgh, NY Listen to this story Nov 17, 2016 — Tenzin Dorjee did everything he was supposed to do and more. He became naturalized as a U.S. citizen six years ago. He co-owns the Himalaya Restaurant in Plattsburgh, which now has a second location. Each year, he helps organize a festival that brings in musicians and artists from across the country and overseas. Tenzin Dorjee, one of the owners of the Himalaya Restaurant in Plattsburgh, was repeatedly harassed in the days after the presidential election. Photo: Zach Hirsch He’s put in hundreds of hours building the city’s cultural diversity. Lately, something else is consuming his energy: fear. Since Election Day, there has been a wave of hate directed at minority groups across the U.S. Intimidation. Harassment. Swastikas. The Southern Poverty Law Center counted over 400 such incidents in the week after the election. After being repeatedly harassed himself, Dorjee is struggling to make sense of this moment, and trying to figure out how to fight back. Dorjee grew up in Bhutan. Over the years he’s been singled out a few times in Plattsburgh, but it was just “minor stuff. They trash all my flowerpots and stuff,” he said. “This feels very different.” It was Wednesday of last week, the day after Donald Trump was elected. Dorjee was walking into Walmart when he ran into two men wearing camouflage jackets. “It was a couple of guys standing next to a couple of trucks. And that’s when they say, ‘Hey chink, get the f— out of my country. Go back to where you came from.’ And I just smiled at them.”  He sighed. “Then it happened again.” Yangchen Dorjee (left), Tenzin's wife and co-owner of the Himalaya Restaurant, sang with Tibetan musician Tamding Tsetsan at the 2015 festival. Photo: Zach Hirsch Just a few steps away, two other people used the same racial slur. “I felt very uncomfortable, unsafe,” Dorjee said, and he never made it into Walmart. “I just turned around and went back home.” Then, a couple of days later, he was out running errands when two older men in a car cut him off on purpose, he said, and flashed him the middle finger. The fact that they were elderly people broke his heart. “That was something that I wasn’t expecting.” Dorjee is culturally Tibetan, and his family came to the U.S. to escape persecution from the Chinese government. Once, he said, agents of the Chinese government caught up with them in India, and he was beaten so badly it took him three weeks to recover. He came here to get away from all that. And for the most part, the North Country has embraced the Dorjees. They’re well liked and widely respected for organizing the annual Tibetan arts and culture festival. In 2015, local artists built a permanent mandala tile mural into the side of a building downtown to honor Tibetan traditions. At the unveiling, Dorjee smiled and appeared to be overwhelmed. He told the crowd that Plattsburgh is full of honorary Tibetans. Dorjee speaking at the unveiling of the Mountain Lake Mandala. Photo provided by Mountain Lake PBS Dorjee with his family. Photo provided by Dorjee “I’ve always been asked this question of 'how many Tibetan families are there in Plattsburgh?' And I’ve always said plenty. And this goes to prove that whatever I said about my family in Plattsburgh is correct…The hearts that I have here are Tibetan,” he says in Arts in Exile, a Mountain Lake PBS documentary about the festival. Now, Dorjee is frightened for his family’s safety. On Facebook he wrote a long, emotional post, which said in part,  “As fear overtakes me for the protection of my family and myself I am now joining the group that believes in right to own firearms."  He continued, "It is a sad decision for me as I believe in compassion but as a family man and human I have faults and it has driven me to the conclusion that a weapon of destruction is my only safeguard against the hate that has been directed against the color of my skin and political beliefs.” Dorjee is a practicing Buddhist. Being peaceful is a huge part of his religion and identity. But he felt like he didn’t have any other options. He planned to buy a shotgun for the house, and get a license for a concealed carry pistol. It was a dark, low moment, Dorjee said. Then he heard from friends, and he slept on it. “I got around to thinking, and then my community members, of course they’ve been very supportive on my Facebook, and then I’ve had community members come up to me and say 'Tenzin, we are behind you all the way.' And when I look at that kind of support, then I do not feel the need to bear any kind of firearms, because that is my firearm.” Instead of guns, he’s buying a new security camera. He’s also hoping to help organize a forum about racism and xenophobia. Leaders from the city and town said they think that’s a great idea. In the meantime, people are on edge. Recently, a rumor ran around SUNY Plattsburgh about the KKK. University Police sent an email reassuring students that they’ve looked into it and there is no evidence of KKK activity in the area. On Monday, Dorjee’s car was vandalized while it was parked outside of his house. He’s not sure if it’s a racial thing, but he thinks so, since it’s never happened before in the nine years he’s lived here.  Dorjee plans to fight back with compassion. In a Facebook post about the car, he wrote, “Bring it on. Your hate is not going to change me into you.” Correction: The original version of this story said Dorjee was attacked by Chinese government officials. Dorjee said he was attacked by agents working on their behalf. The finished Mountain Lake Mandala in downtown Plattsburgh, which stands as a permanent tribute to Tibetan culture.

Put these deeply discounted items near the top of your list. iStockphoto By Andrea Browne Taylor, Online Editor November 20, 2016 Deep discounts on hot-ticket items, including widescreen HDTVs, gaming consoles and smartphones, are always a big draw for shoppers who decide to venture out on Thanksgiving. With a few major retailers opening their doors as early as 3 p.m. on Turkey Day, which doorbuster deals are worth braving the crowds? SEE ALSO: 15 Things You Should Never Buy During the Holidays We asked several shopping experts -- BensBargains.com's Kristin Cook, DealNews.com's Benjamin Glaser, Offers.com's Kerry Sherin, BFAds.net's Brent Shelton and NerdWallet.com's Courtney Jespersen -- to identify this year's must-have Thanksgiving Day doorbuster deals, including some that are available online. Several of the items below will sell for 50% off the retail price. One important note about doorbusters: Availability isn’t guaranteed. Since the items are in high demand and retailers have limited quantities, you’ll need to shop strategically to snag these bargains. Take a look at some of this year’s hottest Thanksgiving doorbusters. Electronics Dell Inspiron 11 3000 Laptop, $100, available at Dell.com. You can grab this doorbuster without leaving the couch. This online exclusive is a steal at half off the regular price, Glaser says, and won’t be available for purchase until 6 p.m. ET on November 24. Before purchasing, however, it’s important to assess exactly what you’ll need this laptop to do in terms of performance. “These ultra-cheap rigs aren’t very powerful,” he notes. Be sure to do some online research, paying special attention to storage capacity and reading customer reviews and ratings. But if this Dell meets your basic web surfing needs, jump on it fast. Advertisement Fitbit Alta, $100, available at Kohl's. Holiday shoppers with a fitness junkie on their gift-giving list will want to take advantage of Kohl’s Black Friday weekend sale (stores open at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day) that includes this newest Fitbit fitness tracker, Sherin says. It’s regularly priced at $130-$150 depending on model type and can be purchased online or in-store. Sherin notes that shoppers will also be able to earn $15 in Kohl’s Cash for every $50 spent. That would amount to $30 in Kohl’s Cash with the purchase of this fitness tracker. (Read more about secrets to shopping at Kohl’s.) Phillips 55-inch Class Smart 4K Ultra HD TV, $300, available at Walmart. Cook notes that deals on 4K TVs -- the next big wave in high-definition televisions -- are strong this holiday season. Early bird shoppers on the hunt for a new TV can purchase this Phillips set, which is regularly priced at $500, for 40% off online or in-store starting at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. It’s one of several big-screen TV available at Walmart during its holiday weekend sale. This TV comes with built-in WiFi, as well as several streaming apps including Netflix, YouTube, Pandora and Vudu. (Check out more Black Friday deals at Walmart.) Toshiba 49-inch 4K UHD Google Cast Smart HDTV, $200, available at Best Buy. This year, the long-standing electronics retailer will open its doors at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. Eager shoppers can pick up this high-definition television for more than half-off the retail price ($450), Cook says. It comes with Chromecast built-in (which is compatible with Apple and Android mobile products) and streaming apps including Netflix and YouTube. (Learn more about the tricks to saving money at Best Buy.) Roku 2, $45, available at Kohl's. For those looking to cut the cable cord, this digital HD streaming media player will be on sale for about 35% off (regular price $70) online and in-store, Sherin says. The Roku 2 model received 4 stars (out of 5) on review site CNet.com and can be connected to your television set via WiFi or with an Ethernet cord. It’s important to note that select items from Kohl’s Black Friday weekend sale will become available online as early as November 21. Check the website starting then to avoid missing out. Advertisement Gaming Consoles PlayStation 4 Slim 500GB Uncharted 4: A Thief's End PS4 Bundle, $250, available at Kohl’s. Gaming consoles are always a hot item and usually available at their lowest prices during Black Friday weekend sales, Shelton says. One of the best doorbuster deals on video game consoles, he notes, is this Playstation 4 system (marked down from $300), which comes with a dual shock wireless controller and the Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End video game. Shoppers who purchase it will also earn $75 in Kohl’s Cash. Kitchen and Home Keurig K55 Brewer, $90, available at JCPenney. The longtime retailer (whose doors open at 3 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day) is offering some noteworthy deals on kitchen and home products this holiday shopping season, according to Jespersen. That includes this Keurig coffee maker that’s marked down nearly 50% (regular price $175) and is available online and in-store. In addition to coffee, it can brew tea, hot chocolate or iced drinks in under one minute and accommodates a 6-, 8- or 10-ounce mug. Toys TS Swagtron Hoverboard, $200, available at Toys ‘R’ Us. Hoverboards continue to top many kids’ must-have lists for the holidays, says Shelton. This version, which is regularly priced at $300, is recommended for children ages 8 and up. It’s available in-store only starting at 5 p.m. on November 24. Not surprisingly, Toys ‘R’ Us will have many other deals on hot toys, such as LEGO block sets, available online starting on November 23 at 9 p.m. ET.

(NYSE: FL) shares ahead of the company’s third-quarter results on November 18. Europe, America And SSS Figures The brokerage expects third-quarter EPS estimate of $1.10, in line with Street, on 5.1 percent same store sales (SSS) growth versus consensus’ 4.7 percent estimate. UBS sees upside to both as the company has some of the easiest compares in its coverage. But, Europe may pose some headwinds as it laps tough high-teens SSS compare in the third quarter. However, analyst Michael Binetti noted that Foot Locker can hit his 5 percent SSS global estimate even if Europe SSS is slow to flat in the third quarter from mid-single digits in the second quarter. Looking ahead, Binetti believes the footwear retailer could guide mid-single-digit SSS growth and double digit EPS growth for FY 2017 with easy compares in the first half along with visible margin opportunities. Comparison Within The Space On the valuation front, Binetti said Foot Locker shares are cheap. “FL's stock looks inexpensive with low P/E retail names outperforming recently. At 13.6x forward 4-qtr EPS, FL trades just 1-2 P/E pts above Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) & Macy's Inc (NYSE: M) — which have ongoing negative SSS,” Binetti wrote in a note. Share Movement With respect to share movement, there could be only limited upside given its recent 17 percent outperformance versus S&P 500 since the second-quarter report. At last check, shares of Foot Locker rose 1.85 percent to $71.01, while Binetti has a price target of $76.

Hong, File). FILE - In this May 9, 2013, file photo, a worker pushes shopping carts in front of a Wal-Mart store in La Habra, Calif. Wal-Mart reports financial results Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016. By ANNE D'INNOCENZIO AP Retail Writer NEW YORK (AP) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. saw its third-quarter profit fall more than 8 percent, dragged down as it continues to plow money into e-commerce and improving its stores. While online sales improved, overall revenue fell short of expectations as the company said it was hurt in part by falling food prices. Profit at the world's largest retailer still beat Wall Street expectations, and it lifted the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast. Investors focused on the sales, though, sending shares in the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer down nearly 4 percent. Wal-Mart, like other traditional retailers, has been trying to improve its online operations and be more nimble to compete with Amazon.com and others. It spent more than $3 billion for Jet.com, a deal that closed in September and is aimed at helping it attract younger and more affluent customers. The company had also said it planned to slow its new store openings and pour money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels. "We are pleased that we can see real progress stemming from our strategic choices," CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. But he added, "We will continue to change and pick up speed to reach our longer-term aspirations." Global e-commerce sales grew 20.6 percent in the quarter, up from 11.8 percent in the prior period. Wal-Mart said it's setting up teams to accelerate the integration between Wal-Mart and Jet.com and working to use its scale in areas like shipping and sharing its product selection. The company is increasing the number of products for online orders by 50 percent for the holiday kickoff next week compared to the number available a year ago. It's also adding staff to handle customers picking up online orders at the stores, and designating a manager for that area. Wal-Mart this year also raised its stake in JD.com, China's No. 2 e-commerce site, after earlier buying an initial stake the company in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of its Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian. "We're moving quickly with e-commerce innovations and taking a fresh approach to how we think about growth," Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said in a pre-recorded conference call. The company has launched a number of changes designed to make its stores cleaner and its customer service friendlier and faster. And it's melding its online and store businesses so shoppers can jump back and forth. It's making sure its vegetables are fresh, sharpening its prices and pressing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. For the three-month period ended Oct. 31, Wal-Mart earned $3.03 billion, or 98 cents per share. That compares with $3.3 billion, or $1.03 per share, a year earlier. Analysts expected 96 cents per share, according to analysts at FactSet. Revenue rose just 0.7 percent to $118.18 billion. Analysts expected $118.6 billion. Revenue at stores open at least a year rose 1.2 percent, shy of analysts' estimates and slower than the 1.6 percent pace from the prior quarter. Traffic rose just 0.7 percent, also slower than the previous quarter. Still, it marked the ninth straight quarter of gains for a key sales measure and the eighth quarterly gain for traffic. Wal-Mart said it's lifting the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast to a range of $4.20 per share to $4.35 per share. It expects revenue at stores open at least a year to rise 1 percent to 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, which includes the critical holiday sales. For the holiday season, Wal-Mart is hammering its low-price message while working to improve store service. It's deployed holiday helpers at the checkout lines to assist shoppers in finding the shortest lines and will run to the shelves to grab products if customers forgot an item. Still, the company has plenty of challenges. Rival Target is also strongly emphasizing value - 60 percent of Target's messages this holiday season will be on that topic, up about 20 percent from a year ago. It also is pushing its stylish merchandise from home decor to clothing. Greg Foran, CEO of Wal-Mart's U.S. business, said during a conference call that he hasn't seen that the contentious presidential election has changed shoppers' behavior. "It's only been a week. I don't have a lot of data," Foran said. "For the last three quarters, I haven't seen any noticeable change." He said Wal-Mart's focused on having a good holiday season. Wal-Mart shares fell $3.01, or 4.2 percent, to $68.38 in Thursday trading. ______________ Follow Anne D'Innocenzio http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

(Jae C. Hong / Associated Press) THURSDAY, NOV. 17, 2016, 11:08 A.M. Wal-Mart’s profit falls but beats estimates; revenue misses By Anne D’Innocenzio Associated Press Twitter Facebook Email Reddit NEW YORK – Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reported its third-quarter profit fell 8.2 percent, dragged down by investments in e-commerce and its stores. Its earnings still beat Wall Street estimates. But its revenue fell short of expectations. Wal-Mart is reinventing itself to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com and other rivals. Wal-Mart has been launching a number of changes online and in the store, from making sure its vegetables are fresh to being sharper on prices. It’s melding online services with the stores, and it’s pressing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. The company told investors in October that it was planning to slow its new store openings and pour money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels. In September, it completed its deal to buy fast-growing Jet.com for $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock in an acquisition aimed at helping the retailer attract younger and more affluent customers to drive online sales. “We are pleased that we can see real progress stemming from our strategic choices,” said Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores in a statement But he added, “We will continue to change and pick up speed to reach our longer-term aspirations.” For the holiday shopping season, Wal-Mart is hammering its low-price message while aiming to improve service in the stores. It’s deploying holiday helpers near the checkout lines at its stores. They’ll be helping customers find the shortest line and will run to the shelves to grab products if customers forgot an item. The company is also stepping up its efforts to cater to online shoppers. It’s increasing the number of products for online orders by 50 percent for the holiday kickoff compared to a year ago. Still, the company has plenty of challenges. The retailer says it earned $3.03 billion, or 98 cents per share, for the three-month period ended Oct. 31. That compares with $3.3 billion, or $1.03 per share in the year-ago period. Analysts expected 96 cents per share, according to analysts at FactSet. But revenue rose just 0.7 percent to $118.18 billion. Analysts expected $118.6 billion. Revenue at stores opened at least a year rose 1.2 percent, shy of analysts’ estimates and slower than the 1.6 percent pace from the prior quarter. Traffic was up just 0.7 percent, slower than the prior quarter. Still, it marked the ninth straight quarter of gains for a key sales measure and the eighth quarterly gain for traffic. More notably, e-commerce sales accelerated to 20.6 percent, from 11.8 percent in the prior quarter. The company said that it’s increasing its bottom end of its full-year profit forecast to a new range of $4.20 per share to $4.35 per share It expects that revenue at stores opened at least a year to rise 1 percent to 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter.

While online sales improved, overall revenue fell short of expectations as the company said it was hurt in part by falling food prices. Profit at the world’s largest retailer still beat Wall Street expectations, and it lifted the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast. Investors focused on the sales, though, sending shares in the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer down nearly 4 percent. Wal-Mart, like other traditional retailers, has been trying to improve its online operations and be more nimble to compete with Amazon.com and others. It spent more than $3 billion for Jet.com, a deal that closed in September and is aimed at helping it attract younger and more affluent customers. The company had also said it planned to slow its new store openings and pour money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels. “We are pleased that we can see real progress stemming from our strategic choices,” CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. But he added, “We will continue to change and pick up speed to reach our longer-term aspirations.” Global e-commerce sales grew 20.6 percent in the quarter, up from 11.8 percent in the prior period. Wal-Mart said it’s setting up teams to accelerate the integration between Wal-Mart and Jet.com and working to use its scale in areas like shipping and sharing its product selection. The company is increasing the number of products for online orders by 50 percent for the holiday kickoff next week compared to the number available a year ago. It’s also adding staff to handle customers picking up online orders at the stores, and designating a manager for that area. Wal-Mart this year also raised its stake in JD.com, China’s No. 2 e-commerce site, after earlier buying an initial stake the company in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of its Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian. “We’re moving quickly with e-commerce innovations and taking a fresh approach to how we think about growth,” Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said in a pre-recorded conference call. The company has launched a number of changes designed to make its stores cleaner and its customer service friendlier and faster. And it’s melding its online and store businesses so shoppers can jump back and forth. It’s making sure its vegetables are fresh, sharpening its prices and pressing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. For the three-month period ended Oct. 31, Wal-Mart earned $3.03 billion, or 98 cents per share. That compares with $3.3 billion, or $1.03 per share, a year earlier. Analysts expected 96 cents per share, according to analysts at FactSet. Revenue rose just 0.7 percent to $118.18 billion. Analysts expected $118.6 billion. Revenue at stores open at least a year rose 1.2 percent, shy of analysts’ estimates and slower than the 1.6 percent pace from the prior quarter. Traffic rose just 0.7 percent, also slower than the previous quarter. Still, it marked the ninth straight quarter of gains for a key sales measure and the eighth quarterly gain for traffic. Wal-Mart said it’s lifting the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast to a range of $4.20 per share to $4.35 per share. It expects revenue at stores open at least a year to rise 1 percent to 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, which includes the critical holiday sales. For the holiday season, Wal-Mart is hammering its low-price message while working to improve store service. It’s deployed holiday helpers at the checkout lines to assist shoppers in finding the shortest lines and will run to the shelves to grab products if customers forgot an item. Still, the company has plenty of challenges. Rival Target is also strongly emphasizing value — 60 percent of Target’s messages this holiday season will be on that topic, up about 20 percent from a year ago. It also is pushing its stylish merchandise from home decor to clothing. Greg Foran, CEO of Wal-Mart’s U.S. business, said during a conference call that he hasn’t seen that the contentious presidential election has changed shoppers’ behavior. “It’s only been a week. I don’t have a lot of data,” Foran said. “For the last three quarters, I haven’t seen any noticeable change.” He said Wal-Mart’s focused on having a good holiday season. Wal-Mart shares fell $3.01, or 4.2 percent, to $68.38 in Thursday trading. To sign up for free CityBusiness Daily Updates, click here.

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • Wal-Mart Stores Inc. saw its third-quarter profit fall more than 8 percent, dragged down as it continues to plow money into e-commerce and improving its stores. While online sales improved, overall revenue fell short of expectations as the company said it was hurt in part by falling food prices. Profit at the world's largest retailer still beat Wall Street expectations, and it lifted the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast. Investors focused on the sales, though, sending shares in the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer down nearly 4 percent. Wal-Mart, like other traditional retailers, has been trying to improve its online operations and be more nimble to compete with Amazon.com and others. It spent more than $3 billion for Jet.com, a deal that closed in September and is aimed at helping it attract younger and more affluent customers. The company had also said it planned to slow its new store openings and pour money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "We are pleased that we can see real progress stemming from our strategic choices," CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. But he added, "We will continue to change and pick up speed to reach our longer-term aspirations." Global e-commerce sales grew 20.6 percent in the quarter, up from 11.8 percent in the prior period. Wal-Mart said it's setting up teams to accelerate the integration between Wal-Mart and Jet.com and working to use its scale in areas like shipping and sharing its product selection. The company is increasing the number of products for online orders by 50 percent for the holiday kickoff next week compared to the number available a year ago. It's also adding staff to handle customers picking up online orders at the stores, and designating a manager for that area. Wal-Mart this year also raised its stake in JD.com, China's No. 2 e-commerce site, after earlier buying an initial stake the company in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of its Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian. "We're moving quickly with e-commerce innovations and taking a fresh approach to how we think about growth," Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said in a pre-recorded conference call. The company has launched a number of changes designed to make its stores cleaner and its customer service friendlier and faster. And it's melding its online and store businesses so shoppers can jump back and forth. It's making sure its vegetables are fresh, sharpening its prices and pressing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. For the three-month period ended Oct. 31, Wal-Mart earned $3.03 billion, or 98 cents per share. That compares with $3.3 billion, or $1.03 per share, a year earlier. Analysts expected 96 cents per share, according to analysts at FactSet. Revenue rose just 0.7 percent to $118.18 billion. Analysts expected $118.6 billion. Revenue at stores open at least a year rose 1.2 percent, shy of analysts' estimates and slower than the 1.6 percent pace from the prior quarter. Traffic rose just 0.7 percent, also slower than the previous quarter. Still, it marked the ninth straight quarter of gains for a key sales measure and the eighth quarterly gain for traffic. Wal-Mart said it's lifting the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast to a range of $4.20 per share to $4.35 per share. It expects revenue at stores open at least a year to rise 1 percent to 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, which includes the critical holiday sales. For the holiday season, Wal-Mart is hammering its low-price message while working to improve store service. It's deployed holiday helpers at the checkout lines to assist shoppers in finding the shortest lines and will run to the shelves to grab products if customers forgot an item. Still, the company has plenty of challenges. Rival Target is also strongly emphasizing value — 60 percent of Target's messages this holiday season will be on that topic, up about 20 percent from a year ago. It also is pushing its stylish merchandise from home decor to clothing. Greg Foran, CEO of Wal-Mart's U.S. business, said during a conference call that he hasn't seen that the contentious presidential election has changed shoppers' behavior. "It's only been a week. I don't have a lot of data," Foran said. "For the last three quarters, I haven't seen any noticeable change." He said Wal-Mart's focused on having a good holiday season. Wal-Mart shares fell $3.01, or 4.2 percent, to $68.38 in Thursday trading.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Exonerated Arizona man shows Utah lawmakers the human face of death row mistakes Op-ed: Should Mormons who voted for Trump get temple recommends?

(NYSE: WMT) shares are trading lower by $2.80 at $68.59 in Thursday's session. Despite a Q3 EPS beat of $0.02, the Street is focusing on its revenue shortfall of $0.5 billion against analyst estimates. The company increased the lower end of the range compared to previous full year guidance to $4.20-$4.35 vs. estimates of $4.34. After a lower open, it had a brief pop but found sellers way ahead of the lower-end of Wednesday's range ($71.33), only reaching $69.52. From that level, it continued its downward descent, so far falling to $68.26. That low comes in above its October 21 low ($67.99) and just below its October 24 low ($67.99). Interestingly, in his latest 13-F filing, Warren Buffett reduced his stake in the retailer by 27 million shares. Posted-In: Technicals Intraday Update Movers Trading Ideas © 2016 Benzinga.com.

The company, which brings in about $25 million in annual revenue, serves clients such as Wal-mart and Big Lots. The hackers, based in Germany, got into the company's database, stealing all of its customer information. Hiring a data-recovery firm to undo the damage cost $5 million. Fortunately, the company's owners, who do business internationally, understood the risks of hacking. They had bought cyberinsurance with a reputable company for $2,500 per year. Once they met their $10,000 deductible, the insurance company picked up the cost of the hacking, which included business interruption and digital media liability. This tale is a rarity. Typically, only a small percentage of small and midsized businesses buy cyberinsurance. Even tech firms, who should be aware of the risks, often take a pass. Instead, most firms will buy a general-liability policy that does not protect them in a situation like this. That's a big mistake. The Global Entrepreneurship Index, released this week in connection with Global Entrepreneurship Week, found there is a strong correlation between a country's ranking on the list and its digital evolution. A big threat to the growth of digitally enabled businesses is cyberattacks. More from The Global Entrepreneurial Revolution: Entrepreneurs in wartorn Syria Entrepreneurship is at all-time high in India The secret to job growth and prosperity Many entrepreneurs give little thought to hackers when they expand internationally, because they think their companies are too small to interest cybercriminals, but they are actually very vulnerable. Attacks targeting businesses with fewer than 250 employees have been on the upswing the past five years, and in 2015, 43 percent of all cyberattacks targeted small business, according to Symantec's 2016 Internet Security Threat Report, released earlier this year. That number rose from 18 percent in 2011. It's not just companies' customer information that is at risk. Their intellectual property can be stolen, too — devastating the potential valuation of a start-up. That is not to mention the reputational damage that can occur. I don't know of any way companies can protect themselves from cyberattacks 100 percent of the time, but by insuring themselves against a breach, start-ups stand a good chance of recovering if the worst happens. Covering the risk So what types of policies do start-ups need to protect themselves? Most often, it's cyber liability coverage. For a small business that conducts e-commerce and collects credit card information, a cyber liability policy will cost about $250 a year for $1 million worth of coverage. Often, that is plenty of coverage for a small mom-and-pop business or very small start-up. A more substantial sized, fast-growing start-up will need more coverage. If you buy a policy, make sure the fine print does not exclude coverage you may need, such as attorney's costs in case you get sued by customers whose information was stolen in a data breach. Not every policy covers this, and you don't want to find out that yours doesn't when it's too late. Certain types of businesses, such as social networks, aren't covered by general policies, so you may have to buy a policy targeted to your industry. Make sure your policy covers you if you do business internationally, as well. Digital technologies have made it easy to conduct transactions across borders, even in a one- or two-person start-up. If you do international transactions on an occasional basis, it's important to get a policy that covers them. Otherwise, you could end up footing the bill for a breach by hackers thousands of miles away — a scenario most start-ups can't afford. — By Sam Meenasian, director of operations at USA Business Insurance in Burbank, California SHOW COMMENTS Please add a username to view or add comments Public Username for Commenting JOIN THE DISCUSSION To learn more about how we use your information, please read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File) (Jae C. Hong) Print Email Bloomberg News By Bloomberg News The Times-Picayune on November 17, 2016 at 9:16 AM comments Wal-Mart Stores topped third-quarter earnings estimates and boosted its annual forecast, a sign the world's largest retailer is benefiting from its push to expand e-commerce and improve its stores. Profit was 98 cents a share in the third quarter, which ended Oct. 31, the company said in a statement Thursday. Analysts estimated about 96 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Customer traffic and a surge in online sales helped fuel the results, which bode well for the all-important holiday season. Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon has been pushing to lower Wal-Mart's prices, clean up stores and take better care of customers. The company also acquired web startup Jet.com for about $3 billion in September, giving a jolt to an e-commerce division that had begun to flag. "We are going into the holidays in a really good position from a momentum standpoint," Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said in an interview. Wal-Mart shares climbed 16 percent this year through Wednesday's close, lifted by its improving performance. That outpaced the 6.5 percent gain of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. Since taking the helm in 2014, McMillon has boosted pay for U.S. workers, tried to improve Wal-Mart's grocery offering and spent billions on its online operations -- aiming to gain ground on Amazon.com Inc. Sales at U.S. stores open more than 12 months rose 1.2 percent in the quarter, just shy of the 1.3 percent predicted by analysts. Total revenue increased 0.7 percent to $118.2 billion. Overseas, the strong dollar weighed on sales, turning a 2.4 percent increase at its international unit into a 4.8 percent decline. Wal-Mart also raised the lower end of its forecast of the year. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company now expects annual earnings of $4.20 to $4.35 a share, excluding some items. It had previously set the bottom of the range at $4.15. Wal-Mart's online business increased 21 percent last quarter, an acceleration from the 12 percent gain in the second quarter. E-commerce sales growth had been slowing, and Wal-Mart has been trying to shore up the business. The Jet.com deal gave Wal-Mart access to the startup's technology and management, as well as contributing more than a month worth of its sales to the retailer's third quarter. "E-commerce was a highlight," Biggs said. "We expect to continue seeing that momentum." -- (c) 2016, Bloomberg. Shannon Pettypiece wrote this story.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.8 percent to 18,011.79 as the yen hit a six-month low, helping shares of the country's big exporters. South Korea's Kospi shed 0.4 percent to 1,972.64 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.3 percent to 22,318.47. The Shanghai Composite slipped 0.1 percent to 3,206.64 while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 crept up 0.2 percent to 5,347.30. Benchmarks in Taiwan and Indonesia fell while Singapore's rose. RATE HORIZON: In remarks to Congress, Yellen suggested the U.S. central bank is on track to raise interest rates when policymakers hold their final meeting of the year in December. She said the improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising rates, in comments that increased certainty for investors. The Fed raised its key interest rate in December 2015 but it's still at ultralow levels that have fueled a multiyear global stock market boom. Economists forecast rates will go up by a quarter-point in December followed by two more hikes in 2017. MARKET INSIGHT: "The greatest uncertainties, namely the election and the Fed rate hike, were significantly reduced over the last two weeks, which gave the market a good reason to refocus on the fundamentals of economic and corporate earnings," said Margaret Yang, an analyst at CMC Markets. CURRENCIES: The greenback rallied on the prospect of U.S. higher interest rates. The dollar climbed to 110.60 yen - its highest since the end of May - from 110.17 yen in late trading Thursday. The euro fell to its lowest in nearly a year, sinking to $1.0597 from $1.0614. WALL STREET: The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.2 percent to 18,903.82.

The retailer raised the lower end of its full-year earnings guidance range and is set to reap additional benefits from its recent acquisition of Jet.com, which Short says will help bring in the younger, millennial consumer.

(WMT) reported a profit for the third-quarter that declined 8.2 percent from the prior year, while quarterly total revenue increased 0.7%. Currency negatively impacted earnings per share by approximately $0.03. Walmart U.S. comp sales increased 1.2%, driven by a traffic increase of 0.7%. It raised profit outlook for fiscal-year 2017. In the pre-Market trade, WMT is currently trading at $69.21, down $2.18 or 3.05 percent. "We are pleased that we can see real progress stemming from our strategic choices and we appreciate the great work by our associates. Yet, we are not satisfied. We will continue to change and pick up speed to reach our longer term aspirations. We're positioned well for this important fourth quarter and wish everyone a happy, peaceful and prosperous holiday season," said Doug McMillon, President and CEO, Wal-Mart Stores. The company now expects GAAP earnings per share for fiscal-year 2017 to be in the range of $4.34 to $4.49, compared to the prior estimation of $4.29 to $4.49 per share. The company projects adjusted earnings per share for fiscal-year 2017 to be in the range of $4.20 to $4.35 compared to the prior outlook of $4.15 to $4.35. Wall Street currently is looking for fiscal year 2017 earnings of $4.34 per share. Looking ahead for the 13-week period ending January 27, 2017, the company anticipates Walmart U.S. comp sales to increase between 1.0 percent and 1.5 percent; Sam's Club comp sales, excluding fuel, to increase 1.0 percent to 1.5 percent. Consolidated net income attributable to the company for the third-quarter declined 8.2 percent to $3.03 billion from the prior year's $3.30 billion, with earnings per share decreasing 4.9 percent to $0.98 from $1.03 last year. Currency negatively impacted earnings per share by approximately $0.03. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the company to report earnings of $0.96 per share for the third-quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items. Consolidated operating income decreased 10.4%. Investments in people and technology, as well as currency exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted results. Excluding last year's lease accounting benefit of $156 million, operating income decreased 7.9%. Total revenue for the quarter was $118.18 billion, an increase of 0.7% from $117.41 billion in the prior year quarter. On a constant currency basis, total revenue was $120.3 billion, an increase of 2.5%. Wall Street expected revenues of $118.69 billion for the quarter. Walmart U.S. comp sales increased 1.2%, driven by a traffic increase of 0.7%. Neighborhood Market comp sales increased approximately 5.2%. Net sales at Walmart International were $28.4 billion, a decrease of 4.8%. Excluding currency impacts, net sales were $30.5 billion, an increase of 2.4%. Globally, on a constant currency basis, e-commerce sales and GMV increased 20.6% and 16.8%, respectively, representing continued acceleration.

Wal-Mart reports financial results Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File) Anne D'Innocenzio, The Associated Press Published Thursday, November 17, 2016 9:41AM EST Last Updated Thursday, November 17, 2016 11:17AM EST NEW YORK -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. saw its third-quarter profit fall more than 8 per cent, dragged down as it continues to plow money into e-commerce and improving its stores. While online sales improved, overall revenue fell short of expectations as the company said it was hurt in part by falling food prices. Profit at the world's largest retailer still beat Wall Street expectations, and it lifted the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast. Investors focused on the sales, though, sending shares in the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer down nearly 4 per cent. Wal-Mart, like other traditional retailers, has been trying to improve its online operations and be more nimble to compete with Amazon.com and others. It spent more than $3 billion for Jet.com, a deal that closed in September and is aimed at helping it attract younger and more affluent customers. The company had also said it planned to slow its new store openings and pour money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels. "We are pleased that we can see real progress stemming from our strategic choices," CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. But he added, "We will continue to change and pick up speed to reach our longer-term aspirations." Global e-commerce sales grew 20.6 per cent in the quarter, up from 11.8 per cent in the prior period. Wal-Mart said it's setting up teams to accelerate the integration between Wal-Mart and Jet.com and working to use its scale in areas like shipping and sharing its product selection. The company is increasing the number of products for online orders by 50 per cent for the holiday kickoff next week compared to the number available a year ago. It's also adding staff to handle customers picking up online orders at the stores, and designating a manager for that area. Wal-Mart this year also raised its stake in JD.com, China's No. 2 e-commerce site, after earlier buying an initial stake the company in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of its Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian. "We're moving quickly with e-commerce innovations and taking a fresh approach to how we think about growth," Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said in a pre-recorded conference call. The company has launched a number of changes designed to make its stores cleaner and its customer service friendlier and faster. And it's melding its online and store businesses so shoppers can jump back and forth. It's making sure its vegetables are fresh, sharpening its prices and pressing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. For the three-month period ended Oct. 31, Wal-Mart earned $3.03 billion, or 98 cents per share. That compares with $3.3 billion, or $1.03 per share, a year earlier. Analysts expected 96 cents per share, according to analysts at FactSet. Revenue rose just 0.7 per cent to $118.18 billion. Analysts expected $118.6 billion. Revenue at stores open at least a year rose 1.2 per cent, shy of analysts' estimates and slower than the 1.6 per cent pace from the prior quarter. Traffic rose just 0.7 per cent, also slower than the previous quarter. Still, it marked the ninth straight quarter of gains for a key sales measure and the eighth quarterly gain for traffic. Wal-Mart said it's lifting the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast to a range of $4.20 per share to $4.35 per share. It expects revenue at stores open at least a year to rise 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, which includes the critical holiday sales. For the holiday season, Wal-Mart is hammering its low-price message while working to improve store service. It's deployed holiday helpers at the checkout lines to assist shoppers in finding the shortest lines and will run to the shelves to grab products if customers forgot an item. Still, the company has plenty of challenges. Rival Target is also strongly emphasizing value -- 60 per cent of Target's messages this holiday season will be on that topic, up about 20 per cent from a year ago. It also is pushing its stylish merchandise from home decor to clothing. Greg Foran, CEO of Wal-Mart's U.S. business, said during a conference call that he hasn't seen that the contentious presidential election has changed shoppers' behaviour. "It's only been a week. I don't have a lot of data," Foran said. "For the last three quarters, I haven't seen any noticeable change." He said Wal-Mart's focused on having a good holiday season. Wal-Mart shares fell $3.01, or 4.2 per cent, to $68.38 in Thursday trading.

Topics Navigation About Contact Contribute Opinion Book Speaking KevinMD.com All Kevin’s Take Physician Patient Policy Tech Social media Meds Conditions MedEd Video After the election: I am frustrated with how people have been expressing themselves Anonymous | Physician | November 15, 2016 I have a memory of feeling overwhelming anger and animosity as a 10 year old. I was holding my father’s spot in the checkout line at Walmart in rural Illinois as he ran to grab the paper towels he had forgotten. He quickly darted back in line into the spot that I had saved him as he knew leaving me surrounded by candy for longer than a couple of minutes would be a bad idea. The elderly white woman behind us who I had barely noticed earlier tapped me on my shoulder. Surprised at what this stranger might want, I turned back and smiled at her. She met my smile with a scowl. In between curse words she furiously yelled, “From our jobs to our spots in the grocery line you guys will stop at nothing! Go back to your country!” I was confused and hurt. I wanted to retaliate so badly, but I kept quiet and pretended to ignore her. Her anger bubbled more and more and then she struck me with her cane while yelling racist comments. My father turned back at her and protected me. He said to her, “She’s just a kid. Leave her out of it.” I was so lost. I felt like I missed something. Leave me out of what? Why was this woman so mad? Growing up in a conservative predominantly Caucasian neighborhood, incidents like this were not uncommon. I remembered back to what my mother would tell me often: “You have a right to be angry. You are right to feel upset. What you don’t have a right to do is to act blindly on your feelings.You cannot turn your anger into violent actions and not think about how it affects others.” The results of the 2016 presidential election have brought back a lot of the feelings that I had towards oppressors I have faced in rural Illinois. It’s hard not to join the millions of other Americans who feel angry and let down by the results of the election. Being a liberal first generation immigrant, I naturally disagree with many of Trump’s policies on health care, economics, and immigration. I have a lot of fear about what America’s future will look like under his presidency. I worry about what my future in medicine, as a woman, and as an immigrant will look like. What makes me even more angry are people’s actions as a result of this election. Reading about xenophobic events across the country on the Twitter feed titled “Day 1 in Trump’s America” is incredibly discouraging. It feels like we have taken ten steps back in all of the progress our country has made in embracing diversity with an open mind. I realize that many others have the same fears about America’s future. Regardless of how we feel about the election, we cannot allow our fear and our anger to be turned into violence. The hospital where I am currently rotating has been busier than ever with the consequences of the not so peaceful protests in Chicago. Trump supporters and haters are both getting ostracized by the other for their beliefs. Turning on the news nightly makes me realize that anger is turning into violence on a national level. As much as I want to show my disappointment in the man that has been elected president, I am frustrated with how people have been expressing themselves. Realizing that Trump is now in a position of power and already spreading ideology similar to the woman who attacked me with her cane when I was ten is scary. I hope no one has to face the racism and hatred that I experienced in that movement. However, these xenophobic instances make me realize that it is up to us to inspire change and react with graciousness. The violence that has been brought on by both anti- and pro-Trump protesters has gotten out of hand. Now more than ever, I think back to my mother’s words: You cannot turn your anger into violent actions and not think about how it affects others. While it is naive to think that Trump will not make major change in the country, it is important to realize that we still live in a government with checks and balances. Our democracy gives us power to help influence policy by writing to state-elected officials. I hope that utilizing this power will further our ideas rather than attending protests that can get out of hand. One of my major issues with Trump’s policies is his stance on health care. Trump plans to repeal Obamacare and implement a free market health care plan. Free market health care increases the corporate power given to large health care organizations and will almost definitely drive the cost of health care up to the average American citizen. More of the money spent on health care will be distributed to administrators and corporate professionals. This will surely discourage many patients from seeking treatment for their conditions and leave the poor uninsured because they simply can’t afford the premiums. While Obamacare has had many flaws, it has insured many previously uninsured and underinsured citizens. It has helped bridge the gap in health care disparity between the rich and poor. One of the reasons I chose to go into medicine is because I believe that health care should be a fundamental right as a human. I believe that the opportunity to live a healthy life should not be dependent on socioeconomic status. It is disheartening to think that I may not be able to treat certain patients just because of their lack of insurance. There is still much speculation on how Medicaid, Medicare, and women’s health will be affected. Though the future of health care often feels grim, it is up to us to stand up for the ideas we believe in. My biggest goal is to inspire change in the system in a positive and peaceful manner.

Please read the comment policy. NewMexicoRam I was going to stay away from Kevin’s blog for awhile because I had 2 posts deleted in recent threads about the election and possible aftermath, neither of which I thought were insulting or obscene or discriminatory. Anyway, I probably still will only bounce in occasionally for awhile to cool down, but let me make this point: Where are the articles and posts that comment on the potential improvement and excitement in our society because of the outcome of this election? Did middle America vote the way they did because they thought they are listened to and accepted, or because they are sensing being locked out of the mainstream, isolated from the advantages this country has to offer? This is NOT to negate the experiences of the posters who saw and felt the harsh realities of discrimination. Those are real and regretted. But discrimination can go the opposite direction just as well and may be hidden even easier. PW I find it interesting that while Mr. Trump has been accused of xenophobia, racism and chauvinism, he’s married to an immigrant, one of his ardent campaigners is a black neurosurgeon, and his campaign manager is a woman. NormRx And his son in law is a Jew and his daughter converted to that faith. NurseMom17 Using the phrase “a Jew” is pejorative. Not nice. neuronerd Ah yes, the classic “I have a black friend” defense. PW I think what’s more telling is a black man campaigning for someone who is supposedly racist. MsPony65 You’re not alone. I’ve had my posts – neither insulting, obscene, discriminatory, nor defamatory – deleted, and I daresay this one will be deleted as well. The potential for change is great. The vote indicates that middle America is weary of the status quo and wants to return to a Constitutional Republic. This does not negate the experience of those who feel the sting of discrimination, but rather indicates that there are those who feel these issues can be better addressed through cooperation instead of polarization. Laura J Very good article and example of how disconnected we are now as Americans. It seems what I see is fear of the unknown. People from various ethnicity tend to have little respect. We raise our children to accept all diversities. The election was historic, went by the rules but it seems people are upset and don’t care about the law in place. Why? Is it the younger generations? NewMexicoRam So now it is acceptable to have “thought police?” Actions that promote minority or disadvantaged groups isn’t enough? If the “thought police” are out to get us, then I guess white middle class males are the only acceptable targets that don’t count anymore. Jewel Markess One is free to think as one wants; however, one would expect a presidential candidate not to appoint a white supremacist into the government. neuronerd Wait where was there any mention of “thought police”? NewMexicoRam It’s implied. Read it carefully. Abbey Beagle-Terrier Well Christians are always fair game. Also the overweight. So it’s not JUST white males ; ) However, one of the reason this non-white woman voted for Trump is to stop the PC insanity. Everyone else in my neck of the woods did the same. White males have more allies than you think you do and the “intelligentsia” who believe themselves to be our moral superiors are not so large in number as they think they are. They simply live in an echo chamber and surround themselves with the like minded. Jewel Markess You seem to think that it’s only left that is against Trump. Why don’t you read RedState – it’s a very conservative site, and most people there are against Trump as well. What exactly did Trump do to change people’s mind about him? Appoint an alt-right spokesperson to a government position? neuronerd Please elaborate on these unbstantiated lies that you are referring to. Sophia 99 Series of checks and balances? Do you read what is happening right now. There is NO series of checks and balances anymore. People have every right to protest this individual and his ilk for their disrespectful behavior to get elected, the lies, the swift-boating, the innuendo, mud slinging, whoring themselves with every special interest group with an agenda or a particular hate for others, and the propaganda. The world is a very dangerous place right now, and to place someone with NO experience is foolish and dangerous.He won because of voter apathy, prevented others form voting, and smear tactics- their goes your moral, ethics, and values. Others protesting have every right to be angry, and to voice civil disobedience. Basis of our Constitution and Bill of Rights. They are fighting the Red Coats! meyati Trump did say since the election that people with pre-existing conditions will be able to get coverage. I remember Trump saying that he would respect Social Security-but that seems to be on the chopping block.. Maybe in Trump’s mind privatizing SS isn’t messing with it, maybe having pre-existing coverage at high premiums is still honoring his word. I didn’t vote for Trump- I’m scared but this acting out is scarey, and I’ve been wacked on the head by opposing protestors. I was protesting about one specific thing-as was my opponenet. In my state, we have these people-that protested Trump- then the same people later protested Hillary, and then Johnson. I can’t take them too seriously.

Posted 17 Nov 2016 20:20 Updated 18 Nov 2016 00:05 A general view shows a Wal-Mart store in Monterrey, Mexico, August 10, 2016. REUTERS/Daniel Becerril Enlarge Caption  Email More A A CHICAGO: Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Thursday reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales at established U.S. stores, hurt by declining food prices and warm weather that reduced demand for winter clothes and other seasonal items. Shares of Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, fell 4.3 percent as investors shrugged off strong online sales growth and a smaller-than-expected decline in earnings. The company also raised the low end of its fiscal-year profit forecast, in line with Target Corp and other rivals that expressed optimism ahead of the holiday shopping season. Wal-Mart said it did not expect last week's U.S. presidential election to have a significant effect on holiday spending plans. "It's way too early to speculate on anything that might happen with the president-elect," Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told Reuters. Biggs said declining prices for eggs and other important products for a food retailer remained challenging, and unseasonably warm weather hurt sales in the back half of the quarter. Wal-Mart's sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.2 percent, excluding fuel price fluctuations, in the third quarter ended on Oct. 31. That was weaker than market expectations of a 1.3 percent rise, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Comparable food sales fell 1.5 percent in the third quarter, versus a 1 percent decrease in the second quarter. U.S. store visits rose 0.7 percent, slowing from increases of 1.7 percent a year earlier and 1.2 percent in the second quarter. Net income attributable to Wal-Mart fell more than 8 percent to US$3.03 billion, or 98 cents per share, from US$3.3 billion, or US$1.03 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected 96 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 0.5 percent to US$117.2 billion. Online sales increased 20.6 percent, accelerating from the previous quarter. That business added 50 basis points to third-quarter comparable sales, its biggest contribution to date. To try to narrow the gap with online leader Amazon.com Inc and increase its dominance in retailing, Wal-Mart has invested heavily in e-commerce, acquiring startup Jet.com in August for US$3 billion. "The U.S. (e-commerce) results were stronger than those in our key international markets, driven by our marketplace offering ... as well as a contribution from Jet.com," Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said. International sales fell 4.8 percent, hurt by a strong dollar and continued weakness in the UK market, but they were up 2.4 percent on a currency-neutral basis. At Wednesday's close, Wal-Mart's shares had risen more than 16 percent since the start of the year.

Asda, part of US retail giant Walmart, reported a 7.5 per cent drop in sales the previous quarter - its worst quarterly performance on record and the latest sales fall is the ninth consecutive quarter of reported declines. Sean Clarke, former head of Walmart's China business, took over as Asda chief executive in July, said a programme of price cuts and improvements on everyday items, introduced in September, is beginning to pay off. He said: “We have lowered thousands of prices, improved hundreds of own brand products and invested in more hours for colleagues on the shop floor - so it's encouraging to see more customers shopping with us in stores and online.” Earlier in the week Asda announced it was cutting petrol and diesel prices nationwide from November 15, with unleaded petrol cut by up to three pence a litre to 110.7 pence and diesel cut by up to two pence a litre to 112.7 pence.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 8:30 PM, November 17, 2016 Updated: 4:00 AM, November 18, 2016 CHICAGO - Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Thursday reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales at established U.S. stores, citing declining food prices and warmer-than-usual temperatures that curbed demand for seasonal items. Shares of Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, fell 4.1 percent as investors shrugged off strong online sales growth and a smaller-than-expected decline in earnings. Burt Flickinger, managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resources Group, said investors should be more patient as Wal-Mart has taken the right steps to fix its business by raising workers' hourly wages, improving operations with cleaner stores and focusing on increasing e-commerce sales. "The Street is making a myopic mistake of punishing Wal-Mart's shares today over quarterly sales and profits," he said. Wal-Mart raised the low end of its fiscal-year profit forecast, in line with Target Corp and other rivals that expressed optimism ahead of the holiday shopping season. Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said declining prices for eggs and other important products for a food retailer remained challenging, and unseasonably warm weather hurt sales in the back half of the quarter. Wal-Mart's sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.2 percent, excluding fuel price fluctuations, in the third quarter ended on Oct. 31. That was weaker than market expectations of a 1.3 percent rise, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Comparable food sales fell 1.5 percent, versus a 1 percent decrease in the second quarter. U.S. store visits rose 0.7 percent, slowing from increases of 1.7 percent a year earlier and 1.2 percent in the second quarter. Net income attributable to Wal-Mart fell more than 8 percent to $3.03 billion, or 98 cents per share, from $3.3 billion, or $1.03 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected 96 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 0.5 percent to $117.2 billion. Online sales increased 20.6 percent, accelerating from the previous quarter. That business added 50 basis points to third-quarter comparable sales, its biggest contribution to date. To try to narrow the gap with online leader Amazon.com Inc and increase its dominance in retailing, Wal-Mart has invested heavily in e-commerce, acquiring startup Jet.com in August for $3 billion. "The U.S. (e-commerce) results were stronger than those in our key international markets, driven by our marketplace offering ... as well as a contribution from Jet.com," Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said. International sales fell 4.8 percent, hurt by a strong dollar and continued weakness in the UK market, but they were up 2.4 percent on a currency-neutral basis. At Wednesday's close, Wal-Mart's shares had risen more than 16 percent since the start of the year.

USA TODAY For Walmart shoppers, some Black Friday deals are starting today. (Photo: SAUL LOEB, AFP/Getty Images) Walmart (WMT) shares tumbled Thursday after the company reported its third-quarter revenue edged upward but profit slipped as the big-box retailer prepares for the crucial holiday shopping season. The company posted net income of $3 billion for the quarter ended Oct. 31, down 8.2% from a year earlier and matching S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates. Total revenue increased 0.7% to $118.2 billion. Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.2%. "We delivered another solid quarter and are pleased with the continued momentum in the business," CEO Doug McMillon said in a pre-recorded conference call, according to a transcript made available to investors and the media. Walmart shares were down 3.6% to $68.76 in afternoon trading. USA TODAY Why Walmart is spending $3B for online seller Jet.com In the increasingly critical world of online sales, Walmart posted a 20.6% increase when excluding the effects of currency rates. The company's results included its $3 billion acquisition of online retailer Jet.com for the first time. The company's international segment weighed on revenue because of the negative effects of currency rates, as the unit posted a 4.8% sales decline to $28.4 billion. Excluding currency effects, net sales in the international division would have risen 2.4% to $30.5 billion.

Analysts expected 96 cents per share, according to analysts at FactSet. Revenue rose just 0.7 percent to $118.18 billion. Analysts expected $118.6 billion. Revenue at stores open at least a year rose 1.2 percent. Most notably, e-commerce sales accelerated to 20.6 percent.

Still, the company said same-store sales rose 1.2%, the ninth straight quarterly increase. Meanwhile, traffic rose 0.7% and e-commerce sales rose 21%, an acceleration from the second quarter. Wal-Mart's stock fell 3% to $69.25 in premarket trading. "We're executing well in our stores and making strategic investments in e-commerce to accelerate growth," said company chief executive Doug McMillon in a prerecorded call. E-commerce sales added 0.5% to the U.S. same-store sales figure, he said, "our largest contribution yet." Wal-Mart said the increase in same-store sales was driven by its general merchandise and health and wellness segments, while its grocery business remained relatively flat amid food-price deflation. The results from Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, come a day after rival Target Corp. reported sales in existing stores fell slightly, but signaled sales could return to growth over the holiday season as the retailer reported higher online sales buoyed results in the latest quarter. Some corners of the retail industry have shown strength coming into the holiday season, cheering investors and analysts who have watched Amazon.com Inc. bite into the brick-and-mortar business. Retailers are in a race to log as many sales as possible before Christmas, a stretch that can make or break a retailer's financials for the year. While department stores and some apparel makers reported slower sales in recent weeks, discounters, home improvement chains and others said sales are brisk ahead of the holidays. Earlier this week October retail sales logged their best growth rate in nearly two years. Over all, Wal-Mart posted a profit of $3.03 billion, or 98 cents a share, compared with $3.3 billion, or $1.03 a share, a year ago. The company had projected per-share earnings in a range of 90 cents to $1. Revenue edged up 0.7% to $118.2 billion, below analysts' projections for $118.69 billion. Wal-Mart also lifted the bottom end of its full-year guidance range for adjusted profit, now expecting $4.20 to $4.35 a share. Previously, the low-end was pegged at $4.15.

The report did not elaborate on the type of stolen items. A caller told police at 2:55 p.m. the woman took merchandise and walked past all points of sale. When she was confronted, she returned some of the stolen items but kept others in her purse, according to the report. The caller said the woman refused to go to the asset protection office and left the scene in a pickup truck. Police eventually stopped the vehicle and recovered the remaining Wal-Mart merchandise, the report said. Police did not arrest the suspect on the scene because of an “illness,” the report said. Police are still seeking a warrant for her arrest. Other reports 3100 block of Inglewood Street — Two teenagers were arrested Tuesday evening on drug charges in a “drug free zone” near Strickland Middle School. About 6:50 p.m., police responded to a report of people smoking marijuana inside a residence. The home, which is across the street from Strickland Middle School, is considered to be in a drug free zone because it’s within 1,000 feet of the school, according to the report. The suspects gave police permission to search the house, where officers found a usable amount of marijuana, suspected methamphetamine, prescription pills and other drug paraphernalia, the report said. After taking the drugs and paraphernalia for evidence, police charged a 19-year-old suspect with possession of less than 2 ounces of marijuana. The 17-year-old suspect was also charged with possession of under 2 ounces of marijuana, as well as two counts of possession of a controlled substance in a drug free zone. They were taken to Denton City Jail. 2200 block of South Loop 288 — The Denton Fire Department successfully resuscitated a 46-year-old woman on Tuesday morning after she was found unconscious in her car in a shopping center. The woman wasn’t breathing before firefighters performed CPR, the report said. She was taken to Denton Regional Medical Center, and her current condition is unknown. Roundup From 7 a.m. Tuesday to 7 a.m. Wednesday: Denton County Sheriff’s Office dispatchers handled 823 service and officer-initiated calls for the agencies they serve, and 46 people were booked into Denton County Jail. Denton police handled 244 service and officer-initiated calls and posted 13 reports online. Denton firefighters responded to 29 medical calls, two vehicle accidents, one vehicle fire and one gas leak. — Julian Gill Comments DentonRC.com is now using Facebook Comments.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Peter Whoriskey November 17 Follow @PeterWhoriskey A boiler chicken house in Banks County, Ga. (Kevin D. Liles) In the vast and complicated U.S. economy, it is rare for an individual to exert much control over the price of a major commodity. But then there is Arty G. Schronce and the price of chicken. As director of a bulletin from the Georgia Department of Agriculture, Schronce makes a weekly calculation that gives supermarkets around the country the going rate for a pound of chicken. The price average from Schronce directly affects what big retailers such as Walmart and Safeway pay for chicken — it’s often built into supermarket purchasing contracts — and that price is then passed along to shoppers. It has, in other words, affected billions of dollars in purchases. But has it been accurate? Recently, this influential estimate has drawn questions about whether it artificially inflated U.S. chicken prices and elicited scrutiny from the U.S. Agriculture Department. Now it turns out that even Schronce has harbored serious doubts about its accuracy, according to an internal document from the Georgia Department of Agriculture obtained by The Washington Post. Over the past two years, the price estimate, known within the industry as the “Georgia Dock,” has drifted significantly upward from other chicken price averages, rising about 20 percent or more out of line with a separate but lesser known index maintained by the USDA. A deviation in supermarket chicken prices of that magnitude would have cost U.S. grocery shoppers billions of dollars in recent years. Food price estimates such as the Georgia Dock affect the price of many perishable products — such as fruits, vegetables, nuts and livestock — because producers rely on them to set the terms of long-term contracts. Many of the price measures, used for decades, are products of long tradition. The root of the trouble with the Georgia price estimate, as Schronce sees the matter, is that it is based on a price survey of eight anonymous chicken companies in the state, and he raised doubts whether those companies have been giving him accurate information. The chicken companies are not asked to show receipts or other documentation proving that their figures are accurate. “I have come to question the validity of some of the information provided,” he wrote in September in preparation for a meeting at the Georgia Department of Agriculture. “I do not think I am getting actual weighted average prices from some companies.” Schronce indicated in his memo that he had been contacted by an investigator from the antitrust division of the Florida attorney general. Moreover, in recent months, the USDA discontinued publishing the Georgia figure, citing its inability to verify the information. Poultry is big business in Georgia, with sales exceeding $4 billion annually. An upward bias in the chicken prices would increase revenue for those Georgia companies as well as any others that sell in the United States. Some of the nation’s largest chicken producers — including Tysons, Pilgrim’s Pride, Perdue and Sanderson Farms — have had plants in the state. Stocks in some of those companies dropped on Thursday. Tyson dropped by three percent, Pilgrim's Pride by five percent and Sanderson Farms by three percent. As Schronce noted, the state’s poultry companies benefit from the Georgia Dock because it costs them nothing and yields prices that are seen as higher than others. Schronce did not respond to invitations to comment. But the Georgia Department of Agriculture defended the accuracy of the influential price estimate and said that it is addressing the issues raised by his critique. “All of the concerns addressed in the document are now being addressed internally,” spokesperson Julie McPeake said in a statement. “It is our responsibility at the Georgia Department of Agriculture to report the data we have received from the companies consistently and accurately.” McPeake said the Georgia Dock index reflects prices of a distinct type of bird and customer. For that reason, the index could have rightfully diverged from other chicken prices. “We trust the companies we work with,” Alec Asbridge, director of regulatory compliance at Georgia Department of Agriculture, said earlier this month. “We don’t see any reason they would submit information that wasn’t truthful.” The Georgia Dock, which has been around for decades, is influential because so many grocery chains use it in their contracts with chicken companies. While many chicken companies and retailers are secretive about how they set prices for buying and selling chicken, some very large players have acknowledged that the Georgia Dock is the basis of, or a factor in, the price they pay for chicken. “Over time, most retail grocery customers and their suppliers have come to trust the Georgia Dock whole bird price quoted weekly by the Georgia Department of Agriculture as the most reliable reflection of the supply and demand dynamics of the fresh chicken market,” officials at Sanderson Farms, one of the nation’s largest chicken producers, wrote to the SEC earlier this year. For all but one of Sanderson’s supermarket customers, the price is based on the Georgia Dock. Tyson Foods said a small portion of their supermarket contracts is “connected” to the Georgia Dock. A spokesman for Pilgrim’s Pride said that less than 5 percent of its sales are currently tied to the Georgia Dock, but company officials have repeatedly referred to the price index in calls with investors and analysts. Among supermarkets, Walmart, Safeway and others confirmed using the Georgia Dock, as well as other factors, when negotiating chicken prices. For all of its influence, however, the way it is calculated appears to have been somewhat haphazard. In the three-page document, entitled “Notes for meeting,” Schronce portrays himself as someone who was poorly prepared for the job of producing the index and who was treated contemptuously by the chicken companies from whom he was eliciting price information. Schronce came into the job of producing the estimate for the “Georgia Poultry Market News” just a few years ago. He has previously authored a gardening blog, “Arty’s Garden,” for the Department of Agriculture and is seen in a Youtube video extolling the virtues of a native vine known as Carolina Jessamine. The blog describes him as “a lifelong gardener and a horticulture graduate of North Carolina State University.” Arty Schronce, a Georgia Department of Agriculture employee, calculates an important chicken price index every week but has come to doubt its accuracy. Photo credit: Georgia Department of Agriculture via youtube.com “My training was inadequate, inconsistent and sometimes in error,” Schronce wrote of his preparation for calculating the Georgia Dock. Moreover, the companies he was required to survey were surly and sometimes unresponsive. “I often received lackadaisical and rude responses to my requests for information,” Schronce wrote. Sometimes his calls were not returned, and sometimes the companies simply responded to his price questions with “just keep ’em the same.” Companies said they had provided accurate information when surveyed. Tysons said in a statement: “When the Georgia Department of Agriculture asks us for pricing data, we provide accurate information based on actual and recent transactions. We do not see the prices reported by our competitors to the Georgia Department of Agriculture.” Finally, the Schronce document suggests that the chicken industry may have too much sway over how the Georgia Department of Agriculture goes about computing the chicken price index. Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, who was president of the Georgia Agribusiness Council, lobbied for the agriculture industry for years before winning election in November 2010. Schronce questioned the role that an advisory board composed of poultry industry executives has in shaping the chicken price estimate. “I have questions about the ‘Advisory Board’ and its role over an office of a state regulatory agency that is supposed to be independent,” Schronce wrote. “I was told I could not make any changes without clearing them with the Advisory Board.” He added he has “voiced concerns in the past.” McPeake, of the Georgia Department of Agriculture, said a review process began in December 2015 after “serious concerns” emerged. She said that while Schronce’s training “may have been abridged due to unfortunate and unforeseen circumstances, every effort was made to ensure that he was indeed trained on some level.” “I took and continue to take this job very seriously,” Schronce wrote. “However, my concern and my efforts can no longer overcome the diminished knowledge and experience and the inadequate staffing at both the Georgia Department of Agriculture and the reporting poultry companies.”   business wonkblog true Please provide a valid email address.

Origins Edition – £24.99 (GAME) PS4 Slim or PS4 Pro: which one should I buy on Black Friday 2016? The big PS4 spending question this year surrounds PS4 Slim and PS4 Pro. There are two distinct PS4 boxes on offer in 2016, and you definitely want to be clued up as to which one you’re buying as the Pro, as you’d expect, is more powerful than the Slim and is aimed primarily as those looking to move into the 4K era. Best Buy – all deals are valid only from November 24-26 PlayStation Camera for PS4 – $29.99 (50% off) Gold Wireless Stereo Headset for PS4 and PS3 – $59.99 (40% off) Uncharted 4 PS4 500Gb bundle – $249.99 (16% off) PS4 Pro   PS4 Pro (originally codenamed Neo) is the next generation PlayStation in all but name. Releasing on November 10, it features an upgrades graphics unit and a faster processor, allowing it to output games in 4K (assuming you have a compatible TV). While it doesn’t play 4K Blu-ray discs (unlike Microsoft’s Xbox One S, also available throughout Black Friday 2016), this is the box to aim for if cutting edge graphics are the name of your game. The software to take full advantage of PS4 Pro won’t emerge until 2017, but Black Friday 2016 could well be your best opportunity to grab this more expensive box until this time next year. It’s worth noting that Sony’s already confirmed it isn’t planning any PS4 Pro exclusives, so you won’t be missing any games if you decide to stay with the current level of PS4 technology, only some extra graphical grunt. The launch cost is $399/£349, and PS4 Pro is bound to be one of the hottest tickets this Black Friday. Bookmark this page so you can land the best price. PS4 Slim PS4 Slim, both announced and released in September this year, is now the default PS4 box at the launch level of technology. If you have the PS4 that’s been on sale since the console launched in 2014, then you know what you’re getting here. It’s the same thing in a different case. All PS4’s support HDR following a PSN update in September, so it isn’t worth buying a PS4 Pro this year if that’s the only feature you’re looking for. Current pricing for PS4 Slim is around £230/$300, so significantly less expensive than PS4 Pro. PS4 Slim is far more likely to be heavily discounted this Black Friday than PS4 Pro, which will be Sony’s new baby during the sales, so if you just want to bag a PS4 console as a Christmas present and you’re happy waiting until next year for PS4 Pro (and the TV upgrade you’re going to need to take advantage of it), then this is the one to watch. Bookmark this page right now. PS4 on Black Friday 2016 PlayStation always takes advantage of the Black Friday holiday, so players can be sure to take their pick of bargains across the PS4 and Vita, digital games, boxed games and peripherals. Expect Sony to announce a digital games sale across PSN in the weeks before Black Friday, and look out for any discounts on the PS Plus service. If you’ve taken the plunge with the brand new PSVR headset there may be some surprise discounts there, but remember it’s only just release. Don’t expect any massive reductions. Last year PlayStation had its most successful Black Friday in its history (with almost 140,000 machines sold in the UK alone over the sales period), but how will it fair this year now that it has sailed passed the 40 million units mark? The answer’s easy. It’s likely to go well for Sony this Black Friday, as it has a brand new, more powerful box in PS4 Pro this year, as well as the bargain, entry-level choice with PS4 Slim. In addition, the introduction of PS4 Pro may well see heavy discounting on the “older” PS4 model, so keep your eyes well and truly open. Remember: all PS4 models play the same games. What is Black Friday? Black Friday is a retail sales day, the Friday following Thanksgiving in the US. Thanksgiving always falls on a Thursday, meaning Black Friday is always on a Friday. Or it’d be Black The Day After Thanksgiving. And no one wants that. Cyber Monday is also a thing, following after everyone’s had a rest on the Saturday and Sunday. Black Friday’s considered to be the start of the American Christmas shopping season, and has been since 1932. The unbridled festival of consumer greed has spread to the UK in recent years, with the whole shebang going fully international in 2014. British online retailers such as Amazon have taken to it with gusto, and UK gamers are now just as likely to pick up bargains as their American cousins. When is Black Friday 2016? Black Friday 2016 takes place on November 25. We’d expect retailers to begin advertising their deals in the month before the big day, and then start cutting prices in the week running up to Black Friday. Also remember that sales will continue over the US holiday weekend and on to Cyber Monday. After that, it’s the Xmas shopping season, so expect sales to continue, but not as drastically as during Black Friday. It really is the best time to buy, rather than waiting for Xmas holiday or New Year sales. How much can I save on Black Friday? Why exactly should you need to pay proper attention to Black Friday and Cyber Monday? There’s an easy answer: you can save a fortune. As well as bringing some massive discounts on expensive technology items, such as HD TVs and stereo equipment, video games, gaming PCs and consoles all line up for large savings. According to Adobe shoppers saved an average of 24 percent on goods last year – almost a quarter of the normal price. When you apply that to expensive tech like consoles and TVs, that’s a significant chunk of your hard-earned cash. The tide continues to turn for online retail, with Black Friday sales dropping at bricks and mortar stores in 2015 once again. This means more and more deals will be offered online in the future. You should absolutely be watching this year (yes, just bookmark this page now). There’s a reason people go crazy for Black Friday. And if you’re wondering how well games consoles perform compared to other deals at Black Friday, the same Adobe report shows that PS4 and Xbox One were in the top five goods bought on Black Friday 2016, alongside Samsung 4K TVs and Apple’s iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini. Black Friday Xbox One, PC, Nintendo, laptop and Apple deals There’s a lot of discounting going on during Black Friday, and not just on PlayStation products. We know you don’t stick to one thing for your daily entertainment, so here’s a handy list of other deals you can pick up during Black Friday 2016 in gaming, home entertainment, computing and tech. Best Xbox One Black Friday deals Best PC gaming Black Friday deals Best Amazon Black Friday deals Best Nintendo Black Friday deals Best Target Black Friday deals Best Argos Black Friday deals Best Apple Black Friday deals Best Black Friday TV deals Best Black Friday laptop deals Best Black Friday phone deals Best Black Friday tablet deals Looking for more than just great Xbox One deals?

By Denise Allabaugh / Published: November 17, 2016 Article Tools Font size – + Share This       Brian, a father of five children, is working at Wal-Mart and not making enough money to support his family. His wife has type 1 diabetes and the supplies are very expensive. They have five children, ages four months to 13 years. Two have attention deficit disorder and one is autistic. Brian wrote a letter to Valley Santa asking for help purchasing Christmas gifts for them. “We do get assistance from the state for food,” he wrote. “We have been trying to save money to purchase Christmas gifts for our children, but end up using that money to pay medical bills or to replace an appliance.” Brian’s letter was one of many sent to Valley Santa from families who need help this holiday season purchasing Christmas gifts for their children. Cindy, a single mother, wrote that she walks to work to make a little money to pay the bills. “It’s getting harder and harder to pay the bills,” she wrote. Recently, she became a grandmother when her older child had a baby and she is struggling financially. She asked if Valley Santa could bring gifts to her young son and granddaughter. Valley Santa needs donations to purchase Christmas gifts for children in need throughout Luzerne County. 75 N.

This ad ran in the 4th Assembly District contest. Campaign footage posted on YouTube An elementary school teacher in San Francisco holds up a sign as he and other members of the California Teachers Association march around the Capitol to protest budget cuts that will most likely slash school budgets and cut teachers. Randy Pench rpench@sacbee.com 1 of 2 i By Jim Miller and Christopher Cadelago jmiller@sacbee.com The Torlakson name has been a near-constant on the ballots of voters in the San Francisco East Bay, where state schools chief Tom Torlakson got his political start more than three decades ago. Last week, though, the remarkable string of Torlakson victories ended resoundingly. Mae Cendaña Torlakson, his wife, was trounced by fellow Democrat Tim Grayson after a campaign that attracted more than $3.3 million in outside spending since March by EdVoice, a nonprofit that seeks changes to teacher tenure and other rules. Grayson’s success was among several legislative victories by candidates who received heavy support from EdVoice and the California Charter Schools Association. The organizations’ campaign arms, funded by a small, influential circle of wealthy donors around the country, spent at least $8.7 million directly to help elect candidates, all but one of them Democrats in same-party runoffs, in six Assembly districts and two Senate districts in the weeks leading up to the Nov. 8 election. California voters did their homework, looked at these races thoughtfully and responded by making well-informed choices. Gary Borden, executive director of California Charter Schools Association Advocates “We are pleased to see that folks we supported by and large ended up being successful,” said Gary Borden, executive director of the California Charter Schools Association Advocates, downplaying the impact of money. “California voters did their homework, looked at these races thoughtfully and responded by making well-informed choices.” When the new Legislature is sworn in next month, its Democratic majority will contain more members than ever who owe their elections at least in part to support from charter schools and EdVoice. The California Teachers Association, meanwhile, made its top electoral priority Proposition 55, the income tax extension on high earners, with billions in proceeds going to shore up public schools. Teacher unions long have had a dominant role setting the education agenda in a Capitol controlled by labor-friendly Democrats. Yet EdVoice and charter schools back legislation each year meant to improve schools. Republican lawmakers have been among their strongest allies on an issue that sometimes divides Democrats, many of whom represent urban areas with poor-performing schools. In 2015, for example, a teacher-evaluation bill by Assemblywoman Shirley Weber, D-San Diego, backed by EdVoice and charter schools, stalled in its first committee when the CTA opposed it. The panel’s chairman, Assemblyman Patrick O’Donnell, D-Long Beach, is a strong ally of the union. Reflecting on the election, Eric Heins, president of the CTA, called the trend “dangerous,” contending in an interview that his group was “swamped” by the torrent of opposition spending on mailers, phone calls and get-out-the-vote efforts. Top donors to the charter schools association’s outside spending committee this election cycle are Gap co-founder Doris F. Fisher; Netflix CEO Reed Hastings; Carrie W. Penner, the granddaughter of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton; developer Eli Broad and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The top contributors to EdVoice’s campaign committee are Southern California businessman Bill Bloomfield, venture capitalist Arthur Rock, Penner, and Alice and Jim Walton, relatives of the Wal-Mart founder. “We can look forward to more of that happening unless we begin to expose where that money is coming from,” Heins said. “This isn’t a popular uprising. It’s a few billionaires (backing their interests in) nonaccountable charters. This is not as they are trying to portray it: a mandate of some kind for charters.” Still, Heins said he was concerned about the eventual policy effect on incoming freshmen lawmakers backed by the education groups, who can serve a dozen years in office. “I think ultimately it will have an impact,” he said. “This is a long-term game they are playing. And if the public follows the money – there is a clear agenda.” The money given for the general election is in addition to the nearly $10 million spent before the June primary in legislative races. EdVoice and charter schools also gave several hundred thousand dollars more to other groups that spent in the races. Just two of their preferred candidates this year lost last week’s election, and those campaigns did not hinge on education policy. This year’s legislative spending, experts say, suggests that EdVoice and charter schools will be active in future legislative contests as well as in the 2018 races for governor and to replace the termed-out Tom Torlakson. “I think the strategy was just to put down a marker” for 2018, said Democratic consultant Parke Skelton, who advised Glendale Democrat Laura Friedman in the race for Los Angeles County’s 43rd Assembly District. A charter-school-funded outside spending group spent about $2.4 million this year to help elect Friedman. “They wanted to send a message that they could be big players, as well,” Skelton added at a recent conference on the California election results. EdVoice and charter schools spent heavily in an unsuccessful 2014 effort to elect charter schools executive Marshall Tuck as state schools chief. They had more success the following year, when they helped propel Democrat Steve Glazer to victory over heavy opposition from teachers unions and others in the East Bay’s 7th Senate District. In the race to succeed Torlakson in 2018, Tuck could run again, while potential rivals seen as allied with the teachers union include former Assemblywoman Joan Buchanan, outgoing Assemblyman Susan Bonilla of Concord and Assemblyman Tony Thurmond, D-Richmond. Several Democrats, including former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, state Treasurer John Chiang and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, are already running for governor. Delaine Eastin, the former state schools chief, said she plans to pair her run with a plan to fix the state’s ailing schools. In a recent interview, Villaraigosa, a big proponent of charter schools, hinted that he expected heavy opposition spending from the teachers union. Issues championed by charter schools, EdVoice, or both, could become part of the gubernatorial contest, Republican consultant Rob Stutzman said at the post-election conference. “This is a secret-sauce issue for a Democratic gubernatorial candidate,” he said. Some see parallels between the arrival of Grayson, Friedman and the others and the rise in recent years of business-backed Democrats who have helped frame the debate on climate change policy and other issues. The state’s top-two primary system, in which the two highest finishers, regardless of party, advance to a fall runoff, altered the calculus. Candidates such as Grayson, who can appeal to a wider swath of the district’s moderate electorate, end up in better position in the fall. That means they essentially have to be targeted for defeat in the primary, something Mae Cendaña Torlakson and her supporters failed to accomplish. “The top-two-primary process has fundamentally changed legislative campaigns, and it’s important to embrace that,” said Leo Wallach of Rally Campaigns, who worked for Grayson and against Torlakson, among several other races. “Voters have a chance to elect independent-minded candidates who may not fit the typical mold,” he said. “Campaigns have to be more thoughtful about building winning coalitions and targeting each unique portion of the persuadable electorate.” The dynamics of the races varied, as did the candidates’ fealty to one side or another. Advocates for changing teacher-employment polices stress that they look less for total compliance than they do for somebody who signals they will look at an issue based on its merits and sometimes go against leaders of their own party. Some challenge the notion of a landslide. In only the Torlakson-Grayson race did the CTA actively engage, choosing to dedicate resources on the tax measure. Grayson did not conceal his support for charter schools “where they provide a way to ‘tailor’ education to the needs of a community’s students,” as he wrote on his website. Heins, of the CTA, said he would closely monitor the incoming class of lawmakers. “The proof is in the pudding,” he said. “You’ve got to watch how they vote and where they put their priorities.” &nbsp; Jim Miller: 916-326-5521, @jimmiller2 Election help Charter schools and education groups helped win these races: State Senate Democrat Scott Wiener of San Francisco defeated Jane Kim Democrat Bill Dodd of Napa defeated Mariko Yamada Assembly Democrat Tim Grayson of Concord defeated Mae Cendaña Torlakson Democrat Marc Berman of Palo Alto defeated Vicki Veenker Democrat Anna Caballero of Salinas defeated Karina Alejo Democrat Laura Friedman of Glendale defeated Ardy Kassakhian Republican Catharine Baker of Dublin defeated Cheryl Cook-Kallio Where their preferred candidates lost: Democrat Ash Kalra of San Jose defeated Madison Nguyen Democrat Eloise Reyes of Colton defeated Cheryl Brown Related content Charter schools and allies pour it on in California legislative races Capitol Alert Comments   Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 0:40 Calexit?

Bhawani Singh Rajawat, the BJP MLA from Ladpura in Rajasthan's Kota district, in a video, said that the top businessmen had made arrangements to sort out their black money because they were made aware of the move, much ahead of the announcement. "Adani, Ambani atram-satram in sab ko pehle hi pata thha. Inko hint de diya gaya. Unhone apna kar liya (Adani, Ambani and others knew it beforehand. They had been given a hint and they made arrangements accordingly)," Rajawat purportedly said in the video.

But that doesn’t mean these stories and others like them—stories that could influence perceptions of your company and affect its sales—couldn’t appear on some obscure site you’ve never heard of and spread like wildfire through social media. Welcome to the era of fake news The coverage of fake news has exploded since Donald Trump’s victory in the recent U.S. presidential election. Craig Silverman reports on BuzzFeed that fake election news produced more engagement on Facebook than the top stories from the biggest mainstream news sites during the last three months of the campaigns. Fake news stories delivered 8.7 million shares, reactions, and comments, compared to 7.3 million for mainstream news, according to the BuzzFeed analysis. So prevalent is fake news that Oxford Dictionaries has proclaimed post-truth the word of the year. The term refers to “circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than emotional appeals.” That definition encompasses more than just fake news, but there’s no question that fake news contributed greatly to the elevation of the post-truth concept. Consider an August report that Hillary Clinton’s super PAC planned to spend $1 million to correct misinformation on Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, and Instagram—more than three times spent to turn out Latino voters. Election-related fake news was predominantly created to boost Trump’s candidacy, inspiring supporters to spread the stories among like-minded people on the key social media sites. Among the stories that gained traction, on display in a Huffington Post piece, included… Denzel Washington Backs Trump In The Most Epic Way Possible Pope Francis Just Backed Trump, Released Incredible Statement Why FBI Agent Suspected in Hillary Email Leaks Found Dead in Apparent Murder-Suicide George Soros: ‘I’m going to Bring down the U.S. by Funding Black Hate Groups’ Germany Folds To Shariah Law, Approves Child Marriages Doctor Who Treated Hillary’s Blood Clots Found Dead Some of these posts linked to publications that don’t actually exist (with sites created just to host that one fake story). Others linked to articles (on Snopes.com, for example) that actually disprove the assertion the post made. Still others were published on extremist websites whose writers were not beholden to principles of credible journalism. Some were on websites published by teens, many of whom lived in the Macedonian town of Veles, who figured out that creating this red meat for Trump supporters earned them money via Google’s AdSense product. Now that the election is over, it’s not unreasonable to expect the torrent of fake news to subside. Don’t bet on it, though. The same factions that spread it on behalf of a presidential candidate are likely to keep up the pace in support of their political agenda (and to build consensus against their rivals). Still, with the passions of the election receding, some creators of fake news are likely to turn their attention to businesses they love or hate. Meanwhile, non-political operatives will undoubtedly learn the lesson of the 2016 election and apply similar tactics against businesses. The list of potential motives is endless: anti-corporate activism, unsavory union tactics, competitive harassment, dissatisfied shareholders, unethical stock traders, even ethics-challenged, bottom-feeding PR practitioners… But aren’t social networks taking steps to end fake news? Yes, they are, though some of it is being undertaken reluctantly. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told a tech conference, “That it influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea. There’s a profound lack of empathy in asserting the only reason why someone could have voted the way they did is because they saw some fake news.” A Twitter spokesperson echoed the sentiment, arguing that “Scapegoating social media for an election result ignores the vital roles that candidates, journalists and voters play in the democratic process.” Not everyone agrees. Frank Speiser, co-founder of social media analytics company SocialFlow believes the algorithms that decide what people will see on social networks had so outsized an impact that he (unlike most pollsters and journalists) called the election for Trump. (He was also right in his prediction that Brits would vote to leave the European Union based on the same data.) Whether Zuck agrees that fake news spread on Facebook influenced election results is academic. It’s a bona fide shitstorm and doing nothing is not an option. Facebook told the Wall Street Journal it won’t allow fake news websites to tap into the company’s ad network. Google has implemented a similar ban. Presumably, that will keep kids in Macedonia from churning out fake news as clickbait to earn folding money. Additionally, a group of Facebook employees have formed an off-the-books task force that takes issue with their boss’s assertion that fake news didn’t play a role in the outcome of the election. The task force has met twice in the last week or so, in secret, but plans to go public with a list of recommendations for the social network’s leaders. But let’s be realistic. Efforts by Facebook, Google, and others to stifle fake news will fail. This genie is out of the bottle. Now that people know fake news produces real outcomes, they will find ways around the blocks, just as spammers and hackers who deploy computer viruses have. Further, not every fake news creator has a profit motive. Someone out to depress a company’s share price, create hysteria about a company’s practices or build a movement against a CEO couldn’t care less if the fake story produces revenue. Their only interest is seeing it spread. It is far simpler to get fake news to go viral than it is to spread real news (or even a marketing video). All you need to do is make it sensational enough to appeal to people whose passions on that topic are already easily inflamed, then make sure to seed it in forums those people are likely to see. For example, imagine how many environmental activists might spread a story proclaiming a company had been pouring mercury in a river that resulted in hundreds of local residents suffering agonizing deaths without verifying its accuracy. Fake news targeting companies has already begun In fact, businesses are already targets of fake news, though the election connection is still part of it. PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi is the target of Trump supporters calling for a boycott of Pepsi products based on her statement that Trump voters should “take their business elsewhere.” It’s something she never said. The fake quote appeared on sites like Truthfeed and Gateway Pundit, which also claimed the company’s stock had fallen 5% because of Nooyi’s anti-Trump stance. Except it was a statement she never made, and Pepsi’s stock price . The fake news is apparently retaliation over Nooyi’s condemnation of the campaign’s nasty rhetoric and a statement that her employees were worried about Trump’s election. But Nooyi also congratulated Trump on his election. Pepsi’s stock has fallen in recent days, but mostly because it has “entered oversold territory,” which has nothing to do with the election. While Google may block fake news producers from earning AdSense revenue, if the fake news gains traction, it still trends high in search results; it was the fourth listing in Google News, shown below: Appearing in Google News lends the fake story a certain amount of legitimacy all by itself. And, like I say, it won’t be long before we start seeing these kinds of stories about businesses sans the election angle. So what can companies do? Suggestions for how to deal with fake news are the subject of a lot of content. For example, media studies professor Brian Hughes writes on CNN that the U.S. needs the equivalent of the Fairness Doctrine, a 1950s FCC regulation that required the three TV networks to air opposing views for every perspective it presented from a party or candidate. “It should be possible,” Hughes writes, “to individually program our news feeds for balance and accuracy. If services like Facebook and Google are allowed to become news-aggregating monopolies, it’s only reasonable to expect them to serve the public good as well as the bottom line.” Even if that’s practical (and I’m not sure it is), it doesn’t ensure fake business news would be subject to that balanced presentation of content. From a monitoring perspective, companies would be well served to identify fake news as early as possible. That means tweaking existing monitoring services to watch for fake news. It also means keeping an eye on the sites that are known to produce it; several lists already already exist, like this, this (although it hasn’t been updated since mid-January). There is also a Chrome extension that will display a pop-up warning if you visit a site that has been flagged on Professor Zimdars’s list, which could make it easy to check the validity of any story that crosses your feed. While identifying fake news is easy, quashing it is hard. Consider the cool $1 million Clinton’s super PAC spent to tamp it down, yet she still lost. Getting advocates and ambassadors to correct the record could be effective. It could also result in those employees and supporters themselves being targeted. Earning and buying media to correct the record may not reach the news feeds of those inclined to believe the fake story—and keep in mind that, according to the Pew Research Center, more and more people get their news through social media. There are plenty of stories about the fake news targeting PepsiCo, and even a Snopes.com article laying out the facts, yet the fake news story itself is still trending in Google News and spreading through social channels. Legal action could result in a takedown of the original story but have little impact on its reproduction elsewhere and its dispersion through social channels. I’m open to ideas about how to deal with damaging fake news that spreads about a company, its leaders, its employees, or its products or services. I suspect we’ll have to wait until it becomes a thing to assess the effectiveness of various tactics. At this point, your best defense is vigilance along with some serious discussions involving PR, legal, risk management, and other interested departments about tactics your company should be ready to deploy. With all the news about fake news, the worst thing to do is nothing. 11/16/16 | 0 Comments | PR needs to be ready for fake news targeting companies Comment Form Enter Your Comment: Your Name: Your Email: Location: URL: Remember my personal information Notify me of follow-up comments?

Let me begin by saying that I am not a gadget or toy person. I have a few that I truly love, like my iPad and my 9 mm handgun, but generally, I could not care less. I don't run out every time a new iPhone drops. I still have the 5c (I know, audible gasp). I just don't like things that require me to read instructions, as I almost always lose patience and interest. Example: I bought a fancy, very expensive curling iron and straightener knowing that it might take a bit of getting used to. When it became clear that I was going to be required to watch hours of instructional video, I promptly returned it. I would rather pay someone to do it for me while I sip wine. Sorry, that's just me. Until recently, my fancy exercise equipment consisted of a couple of $12 dumbbells, a concrete slab in the park and my $100 Wal-Mart bike. Now, to fully understand the significance of my newest toy, you have to understand the history. I enjoy a good bike ride. Nothing major, just a good 10 miles to get my heart rate up and work up a sweat. I once did one of those massive bike races where I rode 60 miles and, no joke, I thought I was going to die. To this day, I cannot fully comprehend why someone as educated as myself didn't grasp the true distance of 60 miles on a bike. Math has never been my thing. Needless to say, since that catastrophe, I stick to short distances. I have also never put much thought into what kind of bike I was riding. Not being one to spend a great deal on toys, I always just went to Wal-Mart or Academy and spent about $100 on a bike. The problem was I would wear them out after a year and have to buy a new one. After repeating this cycle about five times, I could see the long-term disadvantage of this plan. Math may not be my thing, but I'm not a complete idiot. So, I finally decided to bite the bullet and buy a real, grownup bike. I did my research, meaning I asked three friends who take biking way more seriously than me, what I should get. Two words kept coming up: Trek and Bill's. Trek referring to the brand, and Bill's referring to Bill's Bikes on the corner of North and North Navarro streets. I had never been there before and wasn't sure what to expect. As such, I drug my friend, Danielle, to the shop to check it out. You know, safety in numbers. In the end, they had exactly what I needed without making things too complicated. There were only a few options in my price range that met my requirements, and that was all right with me. I went with the Trek Verve 2. It's a hybrid and perfect for a novice like me. I love it. So if you enjoy riding, but want to step up your game a bit, I highly recommend you stop by Bill's Bikes. They are extremely helpful with any questions and more than happy to let you take a bike out for a test drive. I promise that for what you are getting in return, it is worth a few extra bucks.

Then a gunman opened fire. November 16, 2016 | 4:29 PM Home » BREAKING NEWS » ‘I don’t want them to die’: She was pregnant with twins. Then a gunman opened fire. BREAKING NEWS, Violent Crime November 16, 2016 WASHINGTON – The twins were OK. LaKira Johnson could hear a doctor confirm that as she slid a wand over her bulging belly during an ultrasound. They were kicking. Their heartbeats were strong. LaKira imagined them in there playing, oblivious to the senseless shooting that had left her bleeding that night on the dirty tile floor of a carryout place. She’d just wanted a sandwich. Five months pregnant and craving a cheesesteak, LaKira had walked from her home in Northeast Washington to Jerry Chan’s restaurant on an August night. Then she heard gunfire, felt her body jerk and knew a bullet had pierced her back and burrowed through her stomach. She doesn’t remember feeling pain, only fear. “I don’t want to die,” the 21-year-old Wal-Mart cashier thought again and again. And then, worrying about the two girls she was carrying, “I don’t want them to die.” Now she lay in the hospital feeling relieved as doctors assured her that the bullet missed her uterus. She would lose her kidney and part of her intestines, but the twins would be OK. Then three days into her hospital stay, LaKira went to the bathroom, saw blood and knew that was no longer true. Gun violence is such a constant in Washington, D.C., that it is not measured in bullets fired but in lives claimed. Normally that is a clear-cut number. But what happened to LaKira’s pregnancy raises a complicated set of legal and moral questions about what constitutes a life when taken by a stranger. Does it begin when a newborn can survive on its own? Does it start with a first breath? Does it matter that the twins were already loved? LaKira knew it was too early for her daughters to be born, but there was no stopping what had already started. With her boyfriend and mother by her side, and a medical staff instructing her, she pushed once, and the girls came out together, wiggling in the amniotic sac they had shared their entire existence. She had already decided to name them Heaven and Nevaeh (Heaven spelled backward), even before she had to trust that’s where they were going. LaKira is not sure how long they survived, but she held them for hours. She held them as they breathed and after they stopped breathing. She held them naked and dressed in little white gowns and matching hats that the hospital provided. She held them as her mother took pictures of them with her cellphone, capturing images LaKira would later scroll through many nights, sobbing. “I love you, and I will miss you,” she told them both. Finally, after about 12 hours, she was told it was time to let them go. Detectives had arrived to take their tiny bodies to the medical examiner’s office, which would have to address a crucial question: Were their deaths a homicide? — ‘I’ve been shot!’ LaKira had almost asked her 7-year-old daughter, Raniyah, to walk with her to the carryout place Aug. 30. It was only a few blocks away, nestled between a Papa John’s and a lot with a barbed wire fence. Then she looked at the time and realized it was after 9:30 p.m. She told Raniyah to get ready for bed since she had school in the morning. LaKira was never an eager student, dropping out in 11th grade. But she is proud that the second-grader loves school. She is so eager to practice writing that she will pen a poem for a stranger. LaKira was 13 when she learned she was pregnant with Raniyah and 18 when she gave birth to her second daughter, Kali. When she found out she was having twins, she was scared – and then excited. So were her daughters. Already, Kali had started putting aside toys and declaring them “for my baby sisters.” LaKira said she knew what the autopsy would find: There was nothing wrong with the twins. She had seen them. Each fit in her hand, and neither weighed more than a pound, but, otherwise, they were perfect. “It wasn’t the babies’ fault,” LaKira said. “It was me and my body. It was going through so much trauma.” Because the bullet never touched the twins and because they were too young to survive outside her womb, LaKira knew her case presented a unique legal question. Not only would the medical examiner’s office have to make a determination, so, too, would police and prosecutors if someone were arrested. Washington does not have a fetal homicide law and the twins, at 22 weeks gestational age, were not at a stage normally considered viable. A majority of states set limits on abortion at 24 weeks and later, generally considered the beginning of viability for newborns to survive outside the womb. The District of Columbia, along with seven states, does not have a law prohibiting abortion after a specific point in pregnancy. But this loss was not her choice, LaKira said, making it different from an abortion. “My babies were murdered,” she said. Police describe her as an innocent bystander caught in a series of retaliatory shootings. A day before she was shot, a 24-year-old man from Southeast was killed just before midnight a few blocks from the carryout place. And four days after that, a 28-year-old man was found shot to death between two vehicles in the area. Surveillance video from the night of Johnson’s shooting shows a man opening fire indiscriminately into a crowd. People can be seen scattering. Two figures tumble to the ground. One was a man police have not identified but who was taken to the hospital in critical condition. The other was LaKira, who ran back into the restaurant she had just left and called her sister. “I’ve been shot!” she shouted into the phone. Her sister Ebony Johnson and their mother, Cassandra Johnson, rushed to their car. When a light on the corner turned red, Cassandra, a 42-year-old school bus attendant for children with special needs, jumped out and started running. She later recalled passing the other victim. He lay on the ground as a woman stood over him screaming, “No! No! No!” When they reached LaKira, there was so much blood that her sister couldn’t believe she had been shot only once. They waited together for the ambulance, and when it finally swept LaKira away, her mother went with her. She remained by her side almost every day for the three weeks she was in the hospital. She was there, almost brought to her knees, when doctors told her that her daughter now had one kidney. She was there Sept. 3 when her grandchildren came into the world and left it on the same day. And she was there when her daughter, on the afternoon she was discharged, decided she couldn’t tell Raniyah and Kali they weren’t going to be big sisters. Cassandra had been her daughter’s voice for weeks, speaking for her to doctors, detectives and the media. And so she agreed to be it once more. “When I said ‘Your sisters are up in heaven; they died,’ [Kali’s] little heart was really broken,” she said. “They were both so heartbroken.” Photo by: Nikki Kahn — The Washington Post The tiniest victims It was 4 a.m., and Cassandra couldn’t find her daughter anywhere downstairs. She wasn’t on the air mattress that had turned the living room into a makeshift bedroom. She wasn’t in the kitchen. Then she looked in the darkened front room. There, she found LaKira sleeping on a teal-colored couch, with two tiny white gowns draped over her shoulder. Cassandra had watched her daughter grow physically stronger daily. The hospital sent her home with a walker, and within weeks, with the help of a physical therapist, she was slowly making her way unaided up and down the block. But emotionally, her healing had been harder to gauge. After the shooting, her family noticed her reading the Bible more and distancing herself from her living daughters as she mourned her lost ones. Some nights, she stayed up late crying and then napped when Raniyah and Kali came home from school. The white gowns were normally in a mint green box with the few other mementos she had of the twins: two hats, two birth certificates and two white knit blankets, one distinguishable from the other by a small stain Heaven left when she defecated. On difficult days, LaKira held that smudge up to her face and found comfort in breathing in that remaining biological piece of her babies – proof that they had lived. “I don’t think it ever will get easier,” she said. LaKira had decided she didn’t want to bury them. She wanted something – even if it was only their ashes – to hold. Some days, Cassandra felt she’d lost three family members to the shooting. But maybe once the twins were cremated, her daughter could start to heal, she said. Maybe then, she could look at a newborn without breaking down. Already, more than a month and a half had passed since their deaths, and the family, to their frustration, was no closer to retrieving their bodies. They couldn’t afford to cremate them on their own, and the financial help they were entitled to as crime victims had not come through. The D.C. Crime Victims Compensation Program, run by the Superior Court, provides up to $6,000 for funeral and burial costs for homicide victims – but for the family to qualify, the twins’ deaths had to be declared homicides. Cassandra added that concern to the list of questions she planned to ask interim D.C. police chief Peter Newsham when he visited. He had gone to the hospital to check on her daughter and had promised to come by the house. On the day he was expected, she decided to make a lasagna dinner in his honor. For hours, she stood in the kitchen cooking as her daughter lay down in the next room, sinking slightly into the air mattress she had patched the day before with a piece of bubble gum. She remained there, curled on her side, for much of the afternoon. She lay there when the girls came home from school and when two detectives showed up at the house. She lay there still when Newsham arrived. She had been swiping through the twins’ photos and crying quietly when he walked in and sat beside her. He placed a hand on her knee and then her shoulder. “You OK?” he asked. “We’re doing OK,” she said. Newsham stayed for about 10 minutes. He didn’t have time for the lasagna. He was on a panel with other city officials that night to discuss violent crime in Washington. But before he left, he assured LaKira he would do what he could to help move along the money for the cremation. He also expressed outrage at what had happened to her. “The fact that she lost two of her babies is obviously tragic, and it shouldn’t have happened,” he said, “not in this city, not in the District of Columbia.” What he didn’t tell her was that the city had recorded 121 homicides this year and that the police department would be adding two more to that number. Heaven and Nevaeh’s deaths would be counted as homicides, making them the youngest victims of gun violence in the city this year and possibly ever. If the police make an arrest in the shooting, Newsham said, the person will be charged with the twins’ deaths. But prosecutors would decide whether to pursue those charges. Bill Miller, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office, said his office does not comment on pending investigations or charging decisions. So far, no one has been arrested. — ‘They’re with me now’ Five days after Newsham’s visit, LaKira sat next to her mother in a funeral home, looking at pictures of infant urns. One resembled a teddy bear. Another, baby booties. A third was in the shape of a stack of toy blocks. “How are you doing?” mortician Rhonda McIntyre asked. “She’s coming around,” Cassandra answered for her. “We just have to get through this and then the rest of her life.” The medical examiner’s office had finally made a ruling: The cause of death was “prematurity complicating maternal gunshot wound” and the manner of death “homicide.” The money from the crime victims program had come through, and the family could now pay for a memorial service and a funeral if they chose. But LaKira had another plan – one that would feel more like a celebration of her daughters’ brief lives. They were due Jan. 7. But on Nov. 4, she walked back into the funeral home and was handed a cardboard box. In it was the urn she had picked out – a wooden base with three alphabet blocks on top. One featured the letter H. Another, the letter N. For the first time since she gave birth to them, LaKira held her daughters. “That’s all I wanted,” she said. “They’re with me now.” Two days later, the urn sat in the center of a white fold-out table in the family’s living room, along with the mint green box and three enlarged photos of the twins. The air mattress was now gone, and the room was filled with people and laughter and the smell of comfort food cooking. This was how LaKira wanted to say goodbye. At dusk, she walked outside with more than two dozen friends and relatives and passed out 22 pink balloons and 22 purples balloons – one for each week she was given with each girl. As her great uncle prayed aloud, speaking about good coming from evil, everyone stood on the sidewalk, hand in hand. “Amen!” they shouted in unison. And then, all at once, they released the balloons, making the night sky, for at least a moment, a little brighter.

Virtual trade shows were supposed to kill real ones, e-commerce sites were supposed to kill off storefronts, yet the results have been mixed at best, with the best companies combining both online and brick and mortar storefronts in order to grow and thrive.  You may be able to bootstrap a new venture through online efforts, but sooner or later people have to talk to you in person and "kick the tires" on real goods. To be fair, online has killed or damaged a number of industries that have failed to adopt.  Blockbuster failed to adjust to Netflix and other online services, with little else to offer other than DVD rental and impulse-buy junk food. Did Borders die because it didn't have an online offering to compete with Amazon? Or was the market for in-store browsing and the purchase of hardcopy goods only able to support a single store -- Barnes & Noble -- that also had an e-book play? Walmart, the world's largest retailer, continues to survive, but it has spent billions to acquire e-commerce firm Jet.com to enhance its online expertise along with a bigger investment in China-based JD.com.  As a part of its continued e-commerce focus, it is doubling the number of fulfillment centers to speed fulfillment times. Meanwhile, e-commerce king Amazon is slowly starting to introduce physical storefronts in major cities, with stores opening in Seattle, San Diego, and Portland, Oregon, with plans to open up stores in Boston and Chicago.  It is also opening up pickup locations on college campuses and plans a line of small traditional storefronts to sell perishable groceries that people can take home, plus drive-in/drive-through locations for pickup of online grocery orders.  Amazon storefronts will be "labor lean," with few employees, and will have to compete against Walmart's plans to win in the "fresh and consumable" space. Traditional grocery stores also have launched online grocery shopping, such as the Peapod service, providing a choice of pickup or to-the-home delivery for e-commerce customers.   One has to wonder if there will be a future blending between existing fast-pickup locations and e-commerce. Could 7-11 and gasoline service stations chains find new revenues by leveraging existing locations? Mobile and connected vehicles may make it possible for a traveling family to quickly place a lunch order and pickup things they forgot to pack, enabling the family to save time to get back on the road and the outlet to make more money through anticipating and fulfilling demand. Trade shows, especially those that have built and cultivated attendees over the years, continue to thrive. While a virtual email flier and a website can provide technical specifications and generate leads, prospective customers seeing services and goods -- especially those requiring a commitment in time and money -- want to meet with company representatives in order to get a better sense of how an organization and its people operate.   A website can provide an impression while a face to face meeting typically closes a deal. The need for face-to-face contact as a confirming factor is the reason why shows such as CES and ITEXPO have managed to last and continue onward for years and decades, in spite of the (failed) promises of virtual shows to deliver equal or better success.  So where will you be in February?  Edited by Alicia Young Author Info Doug Mohney Contributing Editor Click here to read full bio SHARE THIS ARTICLE Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Related Articles Virtual vs. Real: Both Count When Selling By: Doug Mohney    11/16/2016 People have been predicting the end of "real" interaction to buy things for decades.

Within the past several years, there has been a major fundamental shift in the way Americans do their holiday shopping. The emergence of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and the creation of an entire new shopping holiday, Cyber Monday, speaks to the increasing role that e-commerce is playing in today’s retail world. Despite Amazon’s dominance in the space, a number of brick-and-mortar retailers are doing all they can to keep up. While some companies are struggling to compete, others seem to be thriving. It's Not All E-Commerce According to Internet Retailer’s annual top 500 list of e-commerce companies, brick-and-mortar retailers Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT), Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD), Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE: KSS) and J C Penney Company Inc (NYSE: JCP) all grew online sales by more than 20 percent in 2015. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) online sales dropped to just 12.3 percent in 2015, but the retail giant made a big splash back in August by acquiring online retailer Jet.com. From September 2015 to February 2016, Slice Intelligence reports Jet.com’s U.S. sales grew by an average of 28 percent per month. There’s no question that online sales will play a huge role in this year’s holiday shopping season, and Amazon will likely dominate those sales. However, the five brick-and-mortar retailers mentioned above are hoping they can chip away at Amazon’s lead.

The Associated Press Leave a comment 54 reads This Jan. 8, 2013, file photo provided by Christian Dobratz shows St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez outside the city council chambers in St. Anthony, Minn. (Christian Dobratz via AP, File) ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — A Minnesota police officer has been charged with second-degree manslaughter after prosecutors determined he acted unreasonably when he shot and killed Philando Castile, a Black man whose girlfriend streamed the gruesome aftermath of the fatal shooting live on Facebook, prosecutors announced Wednesday. St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez shot the 32-year-old Castile during a July 6 traffic stop in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights. Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, was in the car along with her young daughter at the time. The woman said Castile was shot several times while reaching for his ID after telling Yanez he had a gun permit and was armed. Ramsey County Attorney John Choi, whose office will prosecute the case, said Yanez shot Castile seven times “in rapid succession” and that the evidence shows Castile was calm and complied with the officer’s requests after he was pulled over. Prosecutors believe Castile never tried to pull his handgun from his pocket, Choi said, adding that as Castile was dying, he moaned and uttered his final words: “I wasn’t reaching for it.” The fatal shootings of Black men and boys by police officers have come under heightened scrutiny since the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. No charges were filed against the officer in that case, but Brown’s death led to calls nationwide for officers to be held criminally responsible. Choi said in Castile’s case that the officer’s unreasonable fear did not justify his use of deadly force. “No reasonable officer, knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time, would’ve used deadly force under these circumstances,” Choi said. If convicted of second-degree manslaughter, Yanez could face a maximum prison sentence of 10 years. Yanez’s attorney, Tom Kelly, has said Yanez, who is Latino, was reacting to the presence of a gun, and that one reason Yanez pulled Castile over was because he thought he looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect. Choi said Wednesday that Castile was not a suspect in that robbery; Castile’s family members have said they believe the elementary school cafeteria worker was racially profiled. The case was among a series across the country since mid-2014 that have spurred a national debate over race and policing.

A grand jury declined to indict the officer who put Garner in the hold or any of the other officers involved in the arrest. The city agreed to pay a $6 million civil settlement. ___ MICHAEL BROWN The 18-year-old was shot and killed in August 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. A grand jury declined to indict Darren Wilson, the white officer who shot him. The Department of Justice also opted against bringing civil rights charges against Wilson. The death of Brown, who was unarmed, led to months of sometimes-violent Ferguson protests and became a catalyst for the Black Lives Matter movement, which rebukes police treatment of minorities. ___ JOHN CRAWFORD III Police in the Dayton, Ohio, suburb of Beavercreek responded to a Wal-Mart store in August 2014 on a call of a man waving an apparent rifle. A white officer fatally shot Crawford III, 22, who was carrying what turned out to be an air rifle from a store shelf. Police said they believed it was a real gun and that he didn’t respond to their commands to put it down. A grand jury declined to indict the officers. The U.S. Justice Department has been reviewing the case. ___ LAQUAN MCDONALD Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke is charged with first-degree murder in the Oct. 20, 2014, shooting death of McDonald, a black teenager. Van Dyke, who is white, was charged in November 2015 on the same day that the city, under judge’s orders, released dashcam video showing the 17-year-old McDonald being shot 16 times. Van Dyke has pleaded not guilty and is free on bond. The video has prompted local and federal investigations of the shooting and the Police Department. ___ AKAI GURLEY Peter Liang, a rookie New York City police officer, was convicted Feb. 11 of manslaughter in the November 2014 death of the 28-year-old Gurley. Liang was patrolling a public housing high-rise with his gun drawn in 2014 when he fired and a bullet ricocheted off a wall, hitting Gurley. Liang, an American of Chinese descent, said he had been holding his weapon safely when a sound jarred him and he accidentally fired. In April, a judge reduced the conviction to negligent homicide and sentenced Liang to five years’ probation and 800 hours of community service. An attorney for Gurley’s family said in August that New York City reached a settlement of more than $4 million with the family. ___ TAMIR RICE Twelve-year-old Tamir Rice was fatally shot by a white Cleveland police officer near a gazebo in a recreational area in November 2014. Officers were responding to a report of a man waving a gun. The boy, who had a pellet gun tucked in his waistband, was shot right after their cruiser skidded to a stop a few feet away. A grand jury in December 2015 declined to indict patrolman Timothy Loehmann, who fired the fatal shot, and training officer Frank Garmback. The city in 2016 agreed to settle a federal lawsuit filed by Tamir Rice’s family for $6 million. ____ FREDDIE GRAY The 25-year-old man entered a Baltimore police van in April 2015 shackled but alive. He died of severe neck injuries suffered during the ride that followed. His death led to rioting. Prosecutors in July 2016 said they were dropping charges against the remaining police officers awaiting trial, leaving no convictions against six officers who were charged initially in the case. Gray’s family agreed to a $6.4 million settlement with the city in September 2015. ____ ERIC HARRIS Former Tulsa County volunteer sheriff’s deputy Robert Bates, age 74, was sentenced in June to four years in prison on a second-degree manslaughter conviction in the April 2015 death of Harris, 44, an unarmed and restrained black man, during a sting operation. Bates, who is white, has said he confused his stun gun with his handgun. That shooting led to the temporary suspension of the reserve deputy program after a report found poor training of the volunteer officers, a lack of oversight and cronyism. Bates is appealing his conviction. ___ WILLIAM CHAPMAN II Former Portsmouth, Virginia, Police Officer Stephen Rankin was sentenced Oct. 12 to 2½ years in prison for fatally shooting Chapman, 18. Rankin shot the unarmed Chapman on April 22, 2015, after responding to a shoplifting call outside a Wal-Mart store. Prosecutors allege Rankin killed Chapman “willfully, deliberately and with premeditation.” Chapman’s body was delivered to the medical examiner with handcuffs still bound behind his back, according to news reports at the time. Some witnesses said Chapman was combative, and one said he knocked away Rankin’s stun gun, according to the reports. Rankin, who is white, was fired after the shooting. ___ WALTER SCOTT Michael Slager faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted of murder in the shooting death of Scott in April 2015 in South Carolina. His trial is ongoing. The shooting was captured on cellphone video by a passer-by. Slager told investigators Scott had grabbed his Taser and pointed the stun gun at him as they fought on the ground. Slager was fired by the North Charleston Police Department. There has been a $6.5 million settlement between North Charleston and the Scott family. Slager also faces federal charges including for allegedly violating Scott’s civil rights. ___ SAM DUBOSE The murder trial of Ray Tensing ended Saturday in a jury deadlock and mistrial. Prosecutors have not decided whether to retry him. He had faced 15 years to life in the death of DuBose, killed in July 2015 near the University of Cincinnati campus. Tensing’s body camera captured much of the traffic stop, although the two sides dispute what conclusions can be reached. Tensing’s attorney says DuBose was using his car as a weapon that could have killed him. The university fired Tensing, hired outside consultants, and restructured its public safety department. The school also reached a $5.3 million settlement that includes free undergraduate tuition for DuBose’s 13 children. ___ DARRIUS STEWART A federal prosecutor announced in September there was insufficient evidence to file civil rights charges in the July 2015 fatal shooting of Stewart, 19, by Officer Connor Schilling. Schilling, a white Memphis, Tennessee, police officer, shot Stewart during a struggle following a traffic stop that escalated after an attempted arrest for outstanding warrants. Schilling has said he shot Stewart because he feared for his life. He retired due to a disability, police said, in a move that allows him to receive disability pay. A grand jury in November 2015 declined to charge the officer. ___ JEREMY MCDOLE McDole, 28, was sitting in his wheelchair when he was shot and killed in September 2015 in Wilmington, Delaware, after police received a 911 call about a man with a gun. A bystander’s cellphone footage showed officers repeatedly telling McDole to drop his weapon and raise his hands, with McDole reaching for his waist area before shots erupted. The Delaware attorney general’s office decided against criminal charges against four Wilmington police officers involved, although investigators concluded one officer showed “extraordinarily poor” police work. ___ RICKY BALL Former Columbus, Mississippi, police officer Canyon Boykin, who is white, was indicted in September for manslaughter in the shooting death of Ball, 26. Boykin, facing trial Nov. 28, has said he shot Ball because the man appeared to point a gun at him during a foot chase in October 2015. The city fired Boykin as he was trying to resign, saying he had broken department policy by not turning on his body camera, by inviting his fiancee to ride along without permission, and by making derogatory social media posts about African-Americans, women and disabled people. Boykin has sued the city, claiming violations of his constitutional rights. ___ JAMAR CLARK The November 2015 shooting death of 24-year-old Clark sparked weeks of protests in Minneapolis. The officers, Mark Ringgenberg and Dustin Schwarze, were trying to arrest Clark when he was shot once in the head. He died a day later. A key issue in that investigation was whether Clark was handcuffed when he was shot, as some witnesses said. The federal and state probes came to the same conclusion: Clark was not. Investigators said Ringgenberg felt Clark’s hand trying to grab his weapon and shouted to Schwarze, who then shot Clark. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman decided earlier this year not to charge either officer, and an internal police investigation cleared both men last month. ___ DEMARCUS SEMER A Florida grand jury cleared two police officers in September who fatally shot Semer, an unarmed black motorist, in April 2016 as he fled. Prosecutors said the man’s actions gave the officers a reasonable belief that their lives were in danger. The St. Lucie County Grand Jury cleared Fort Pierce police Sgt. Brian MacNaught and officer Keith Holmes for the shooting of Semer, 21, during a traffic stop. Prosecutors say their investigation showed he refused to get out of his car and then tried to drive away, clipping Holmes and dragging MacNaught. Both officers are white. ___ ALTON STERLING Sterling, 37, was shot to death July 5, 2016, as two white officers pinned him to the pavement outside a convenience store where he had been selling CDs. The killing was captured on cellphone video and circulated widely online, sparking widespread demonstrations across Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Officers Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake II were placed on administrative leave. Neither officer has been charged in the case, which was turned over to federal investigators. ___ TYRE KING The 13-year-old Ohio youth was fatally shot by a Columbus police officer Sept. 14 after running from police investigating a reported armed robbery. Police said he a pulled a BB gun that looked like a real firearm. Officer Bryan Mason, who is white, was put on administrative desk duty while the investigation into Tyre King’s death continues. The attorney for his family has asked for a Justice Department review. ___ KEITH LAMONT SCOTT The North Carolina State bureau of Investigation is reviewing the fatal Sept. 20 shooting of Scott by a black Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer. Scott, 43, was sitting in his vehicle in the parking lot of his Charlotte apartment complex when he was shot by police trying to find a different man. Police video showed officers shouting for Scott to drop a gun numerous times as he slowly backed out of an SUV. Scott’s family said he did not have a gun and was reading a book. The shooting, part of which was recorded by his wife and shared widely on social media, caused days of violent protests and a state of emergency to be declared in Charlotte. ___ TERENCE CRUTCHER Tulsa, Oklahoma, police Officer Betty Jo Shelby was charged with first-degree manslaughter on Sept. 22 in the shooting of Crutcher, an unarmed man. Shelby, who is white, shot the 40-year-old Crutcher on Sept. 16 shortly after she arrived on a street to find his SUV stopped in the middle of the road. Crutcher was seen without a weapon and with his hands up on videos from a patrol car dashboard and a police helicopter before Shelby shot him. Police Chief Chuck Jordan has said that Crutcher did not have a gun on his body or in his SUV when he was shot. Shelby has pleaded not guilty and is on unpaid leave. ___ ALFRED OLANGO In the San Diego suburb of El Cajon, a police officer opened fire on Ugandan refugee Olango within a minute of arriving at the scene on Sept. 27. Olango’s sister had described her brother as mentally unbalanced in multiple 911 calls. Video released by police shows the officer approached the 38-year-old man with gun drawn, as Olango paced in a strip mall parking lot. Olango pulls something from his pocket, takes what police call a “shooting stance,” and aims something at the officer, who then fires his gun. A second officer fired his Taser simultaneously. The object in Olango’s hands turned out to be a 4-inch electronic cigarette device. The two officers were placed on leave as the district attorney investigates. __ DEBORAH DANNER New York police were responding Oct. 18 to a 911 call about an emotionally disturbed person when Sgt. Hugh Barry encountered Danner, 66, in her Bronx apartment. The mentally ill woman picked up a baseball bat in her bedroom and tried to hit Barry, who fired shots that killed her. New York’s mayor rebuked him publicly the next day, and he has been stripped of his badge and gun and placed on desk duty while the state attorney general’s office determines whether the case falls under its authority to investigate police shootings of unarmed civilians. Police are also investigating the officer’s actions. Also On New Pittsburgh Courier: Red Carpet Rundown: 2016 Oscars 22 photos Launch gallery Red Carpet Rundown: 2016 Oscars 1. Chris Rock 1 of 22 2.

(NYSE: WMT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) heated up earlier this year when Wal-Mart tried to steal Amazon's thunder during its Prime selling event. The rivalry between the two giants intensified on Wednesday after Amazon announced it will offer shoppers more than 35 days of Black Friday deals. Amazon said in a press release that the only thing better than a single day of door-buster deals is a new deal every five minutes for more than 35 days — and this is exactly what Amazon will offer consumers. Many of the best deals will be offered during the "Turkey 5" days starting on Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday. Customers can "gobble up" gifts for themselves or loved ones within electronic, toys, fashion items and more. "Customers want to shop anywhere, any time, and any way, especially during the five super popular days for online shopping running from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday," said Steve Shure, vice president of Amazon. "At Amazon, we keep finding new ways to make holiday shopping fun, easy, and accessible including new innovations in voice shopping with Alexa, super-fast Prime shipping, and mobile shopping with the free Amazon shopping app." What To Expect Here is a small sample of what consumers can expect to find during Amazon's massive selling event.

Shopping 11 0 0 November 16, 2016 Best Buy Black Friday 2016 Deals Vs Target, Walmart: Where Will You Find The Perfect HDTV, PS4, And Xbox One S Bundle? David Cornell The Best Buy Black Friday 2016 deals have been unleashed, as have others from Walmart and Target. This might be the perfect time to upgrade your current gaming setup with the PS4 Pro, the Xbox One S, and a bigger or higher-resolution HDTV. This holiday season has already seen the launches of three consoles, two of which are upgrades and one being a retro bundle. While the NES Classic Edition will likely be sold out to all but the luckiest who camp out on Amazon and other online shopping sites through next July, you can sadly still go to eBay and grab one at a crazy mark-up. Nintendo says they are working to ramp up production on the mini-console, but it’s unknown if they can make the NES Mini at a rate which doesn’t remind hopeful gamers of the Amiibo. NES Classic Edition’s limited supply is attracting scalpers and their bots https://t.co/4zsPavsfWh by @jeffgrubb — VentureBeat (@VentureBeat) November 16, 2016 The PlayStation 4 Pro is supposedly Sony’s ultimate upgrade for their latest console. While not being officially called a new console — it’s more of a PS4 with more power — it boasts compatibility with upcoming 4K gaming titles, streams video in 4K, and has HDR support for older games. The console is also fully compatible with what may be a new trend in gaming, the VR headset. Of course, for now, the headset is said to be little more than a gimmick with no serious support, considering that Batman VR is one of its best launch titles. The Xbox One S is merely a stepping stone toward Microsoft’s upcoming Scorpio; it doesn’t support full 4K just yet (except for video streaming), but it upscales current titles and offers a 4K Blu-ray drive in the unit. The Scorpio is said to be compatible with the Oculus Rift, a device that currently demands a high-end gaming PC to operate correctly. Here are 60 of the best Black Friday deals from Best Buy https://t.co/skRG1Uxo4S — Mashable (@mashable) November 10, 2016 In a set of lists compiled by ABC News, HDTVs are being discounted in all three of these major outlets. If your budget is tight, you might want to go for the least expensive option at under $100 and skip Target. Twenty-four-inch HDTVs might not be the ultimate home theater experience, but they will work for today’s consoles as a functional option. Walmart has the 24-inch Samsung for $98.00, which might be the highest quality option compared with the LG LED 720p HDTV for $79.99 from Best Buy. Target’s least expensive option is the 32-inch Polaroid LED TV for $85.00. On the higher-resolution end, Best Buy appears to live up to their name with the 70-inch Vizio 4K Ultra HD with Chromecast built-in for $999.99. Walmart has the second-most expensive option with the 65-inch Samsung Smart HDTV for $798. Target again comes in last, though not lacking in resolution or quality, with the 60-inch Samsung 4K UHD for $697.99. We’ve got #BlackFriday deals that just couldn’t wait. Get ’em while they’re hot. #GiftingMadeEasy https://t.co/eBjmwhTvvp — Best Buy (@BestBuy) November 10, 2016 BGR has released a list of Best Buy’s ultimate gaming deals, including a PS4 Pro bundled with a 55-inch Toshiba Smart 4K UHD TV for $749.98. The PlayStation 4 can also be bundled with Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, The Last of Us Remastered, and Ratchet & Clank for $249.99, according to BFAds. Also planned are the Xbox One S bundled with Minecraft for $249.99, and the 1TB version bundled with Battlefield 1 Special Edition for $299.99. Walmart and Target are also offering similar deals on both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One S, although Target has a slight advantage by offering a $40 gift card alongside them, while Walmart is giving out $30 gift cards. Neither Walmart nor Target appear to be bundling the consoles with HDTVs, making Best Buy appear to be the store to stop by for their PS4 Pro deal. Are you planning to take advantage of these Best Buy Black Friday 2016 deals on HDTVs and consoles?

(NYSE:WMT) delivers its third quarter earnings report before the opening bell on Thursday, the sentiment of the entire retail world will hang in the balance. That’s because as Walmart goes, the rest of the retail sector tends to follow. Its results have even been used as an indicator of consumer sentiment, which isn’t surprising, considering it’s the world’s largest retailer with over 11,500 locations worldwide. Analysts are expecting the Bentonville, AR-based company to deliver Q3 EPS of $0.96 on revenues of $117.8 billion, both of which would be slightly down from the year-ago period. In other words, investors will be happy if WMT produces a quarter that’s no better, but no worse, than last year’s third quarter. The last time we heard from Walmart, at its investor day back in October, the company forecast full-year 2017 EPS of $4.15 to $4.35, which could miss the $4.33 expected by analysts. We’ll likely see an update of this guidance during tomorrow’s ensuing conference call, and WMT’s price movement will likely be heavily influenced by that update. Speaking of WMT shares, they’ve performed very well this year, but the road hasn’t been easy. The stock suffered major corrections in May and October before making their latest run. WMT is still well off its all-time highs around $89 set back in early 2015, but a good report on Thursday could help propel the stock well back into the stratosphere. Stay tuned tomorrow morning when we’ll bring you full coverage of Walmart’s report, including reported numbers, guidance, and analysis of what’s to come. Wal-Mart shares rose $0.12 (+0.17%) to $71.54 in Wednesday afternoon trading. Year-to-date, WMT has gained 16.66%. Tags: earnings Equity NYSE:WMT retail Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

Tropical Parkway. At the 11 a.m. event, Phil Kalsman, executive director of the March of Dimes in Las Vegas, will be on hand to discuss how preterm births are increasing in the U.S. for the first time in eight years, said Seva Beauty franchise owner Douglas Grant. The March of Dimes in 2003 launched the Prematurity Campaign to help families have full-term, healthy babies. The group is funding lifesaving research and advocating legislation to improve care for mothers and babies. Seva locations in Las Vegas and Henderson have been collecting donations for the March of Dimes during November, Prematurity Awareness Month, and are supporting the March of Dimes' upcoming Nurse of the Year event. "So many families in our area are affected by sick or premature infants," said Dr. Audrey Davis, co-owner of Seva's Centennial and Henderson (540 Marks St) locations and a neonatologist at Sunrise Children's Hospital. "It really takes a village to help care for these children. It's exciting to have Seva involved to help raise awareness and bring a little beauty and joy as well." Seva, which has more than 100 spas in the United States, offers no-appointments-necessary service perfect for that last-minute beauty service. Licensed estheticians offer brow shaping (threading and waxing); brow tinting, lash extensions, facials, makeup and other services. Grant said he is excited about opening his second Seva location in the Centennial area. "Before signing the franchise agreement, I was told that the Centennial Wal-Mart was the busiest Wal-Mart in the entire state," he said. Chris Beavor, corporate broker for Silver State Realty & Investments - which has other projects in the northwest - said of the Centennial area, "Small retail businesses in that area survived the 'great recession,' so it leads me to believe that any solid business model that is looking at opening in that area now should do great." Hillary Steinberg, senior associate, retail, for MDL Group, said businesses like Seva are part of a growing trend. "Taking advantage of every square foot of retail space within a big-box merchandise store is an effective strategy to offer their core customers services without having to leave the property. By subleasing extra space, the retailer adds leasing income to their bottom line while drawing in consumers for everything from eyeglasses to salon services to fast food."

The company releases results for its latest quarter on Thursday before the markets open. Cramer also says the retailer's recent acquisition of Jet.com will be good for Walmart. "I am inclined to like Target ( TGT) more than Walmart, even after the run of Target," he said. Target topped Wall Street's earnings estimates on Wednesday and reported a 26% increase in digital sales. Shares of Walmart are up roughly 17% so far this year.

(WPVI) -- Upper Merion Township police are investigating a robbery of a Walmart in King of Prussia. Police say on Monday, November 7, two men entered the store around 11:50 p.m. They left a short time later without making a purchase. They were seen in a newer model, silver Hyundai Santa Fe, bearing an unknown PA registration. These men are considered by police to be persons of interest as they may have information about a robbery which occurred at the store four days later. Police say on Friday, November 11, around 11:48 p.m. two men entered the same Walmart store. They were seen in a similar vehicle. Police say one of the suspects took out a handgun and demanded money from employees at the cash registers. The pair then fled with an undetermined amount of cash. No one was injured during the robbery. Anyone with information regarding the identity of the men is asked to contact the Upper Merion Township Police Department's Investigations Division at 610-265-3232.

Walmart May Be Your Last Hope Andrew E. Freedman Staff Writer Tech Media Network (Tom's Guide)November 16, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share If you're anything like the staff here at Tom's Guide, you've been unsuccessfully looking for an NES Classic. If you have a fast mouse finger, however, Walmart might have your back this week. On Facebook, the company announced that it would release some stock every day this week (Nov. 16 to Nov. 18) at 5 p.m. ET / 2 p.m. PT each day. It says there will be "limited quantities," but not how many the company will be releasing each day. That's all up to luck. You can keep refreshing this page, which Walmart is using as a placeholder. It will update to reflect the real price (it reads $399 when not in stock) when the sale begins. MORE: Where to Buy Nintendo's Elusive NES Classic The $60 system includes 30 classic NES games in a miniature version of Nintendo's first home console. There have been extremely limited quantities since the plug-and-play console released last week, and it has been sold out continuously since launch. It's reminiscent of Nintendo's initial launch of its Amiibo figurines, which drove tons of sales and were very hard to find. As of this writing, scalpers are reselling the NES Classic on Ebay for as high as $500. Last week, Nintendo tweeted that "[t]here will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year."

RANKED third-best on a scorecard from Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families that ranks major retailers’ policies on harmful chemicals. COURTESY SAFERCHEMICALS.ORG Print Email Comment Tweet Posted: Wednesday, November 16, 2016 9:57 am By Lauren Coleman-Lochner Bloomberg News health care CVS reports increases in profit, revenue in 3Q (Nov. 8, 2016) financial services Report: CVS makes list of companies with highest corporate tax rates (Nov. 3, 2016) health care CVS laying off 250 in R.I. (Nov. 3, 2016) NEW YORK - Here’s one area where Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is handily beating Amazon.com Inc.: telling shoppers what ingredients are in the products they’re buying. That’s the conclusion of a scorecard that ranks major retailers’ policies on harmful chemicals. Wal-Mart holds the top spot, followed by Target Corp. and Woonsocket-based CVS Health Corp. Amazon occupies last place in the study. The report by Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families, a Washington-based coalition that advocates the use of more healthful products, ranked the 11 biggest merchants on a 130-point scale. The scores are based on 13 metrics, including ingredient disclosure, credible safety screening and efforts to find safer alternatives. “Our policy is really to encourage a race to the top among leading retailers,” said Mike Schade, who leads the group’s retail campaign and co-wrote the report. “It’s more critical now than ever for big retailers, companies like Amazon and Costco, to use their multibillion-dollar purchasing power to drive toxic chemicals out of consumer products.” <a href="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/click/zone?zid=1&pid=0&lookup=true&position=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> <img src="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/view/banner/image/zone?zid=1&pid=0&position=1" height="60" width="468" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Click Here!"> </a> Consumers, retailers and manufacturers are all taking a closer look at what goes into the products they buy, sell and make as evolving science points to harm even from small exposures of some chemicals and techniques. That’s prompted the two largest U.S. retailers, Wal-Mart and Target, to introduce programs in the past three years to minimize the use of toxic ingredients in the products they offer. “We are excited about the progress we’ve made in the chemicals space,” Wal-Mart spokesman Kevin Gardner said. “To date, our suppliers have successfully removed 95 percent of high-priority chemicals by volume weight from products we sell in Wal-Mart’s U.S. stores that are in the scope of our policy.” The retailer will continue to work with its suppliers and groups such as Safer Chemicals “to advance sustainable chemistry,” Gardner said. Wal-Mart, Target and CVS Health Corp. were commended for “making meaningful progress toward adopting policies for safer chemicals and products.” Wal-Mart scored a B, with 78.5 points, closely followed by Target at 76.5. CVS was graded C, with a score of 53. “We continue to apply a rigorous process in identifying chemicals of concern,” said Eileen Howard Boone, a senior vice president at CVS Health. “Our goal is to ensure we meet consumer demand for safe, effective and environmentally preferred ingredients and provide sufficient information to educate our customers.” Costco holds the penultimate spot on the list, with an F grade and 9.5 points, while the Internet giant Amazon ranked last with 7.5. In July, Wal-Mart released a list of eight high-priority chemical groups it’s asked suppliers to eliminate, elaborating on a policy announced in 2013 to offer cleaning and personal-care products with safer ingredients. ‘Greater transparency’ Target, meanwhile, has expanded its own three-year-old program that rewards suppliers that list ingredients and choose safer substances. It added the cosmetics category and increased the number of substances it wants vendors to avoid. Concern about harmful substances in the products they come into close contact with “is very much top-of-mind” for its customers, said Jennifer Silberman, Target’s vice president of wellness and sustainability. “We know that our guests are asking for greater transparency.” Best Buy Co. and Walgreens Boots Alliance have both promised to develop written safer chemical policies, the report said. They ranked fourth and seventh, respectively. Costco and Walgreens didn’t respond to a request for comment on the report, while Amazon had no immediate comment. Best Buy confirmed that it is working on a written policy but declined to comment further.

Safety Group Lists ’10 Worst Toys’ Of 2016 Shopping 2 0 0 November 16, 2016 W.A.T.C.H. Safety Group Lists ’10 Worst Toys’ Of 2016 Lindsay McCane Christmas is quickly approaching, and parents are preparing to head out to the stores to check off items off their kid’s Christmas lists. Finding the perfect, safe toy can be somewhat challenging, which is why the safety group World Against Toys Causing Harm Inc., or W.A.T.C.H., has listed the “10 Worst Toys” of 2016. “Although parents have a right to expect that toys they give to their children are safe, unsafe toys remain an ongoing problem,” the group said in a press release. “Due to poor design, manufacturing and marketing practices, there are toys available for purchase today with the potential to lead to serious injury and even death. W.A.T.C.H. urges parents and caregivers to take precautions when buying toys— especially during the upcoming 2016 Holiday Season, which accounts for more than 65 percent of all toy sales.” Below is the list of 2016’s “10 Worst Toys.” PEPPA PIG’S MUDDY PUDDLES FAMILY: This toy, which features four Peppa Pig figurines, is available for purchase at Target and Amazon.com. At a cost of only $11.99, it may seem like a very reasonable purchase. However, as W.A.T.C.H points out, some packages say it is safe for ages two plus when there are small parts that can lead to choking if swallowed. #Character#Toy: Peppa Pig Toy Family Pack Figures Toys Gift Set Daddy Mummy Kids Playset NEW https://t.co/s79fKbscGK#Toyspic.twitter.com/fmysUuvv7p — Toys Charm (@clintonCedri) November 5, 2016 KIDS TIME BABY CHILDREN’S ELEPHANT PILLOW: The elephant pillow, which is sold on Amazon.com for $19.99, could potentially suffocate an infant. “The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has warned that a pillow can block a baby’s mouth and can cause a baby to suffocate.” “Infant pillow[s]” and “any other similar article[s]” which are “intended or promoted for use by children under one year of age” have been banned by the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (16 CFR 1500.18).” SLIMEBALL SLINGER: The Slimeball Slinger is sold at Target and on Amazon.com for $24.99. Although the packaging suggests the toy should never be used to shoot another person or animal, W.A.T.C.H acknowledges that the toy works similarly to a slingshot, and can shoot up to 30 feet, causing a potential eye injury. BANZAI BUMP N’ BOUNCE BODY BUMPERS: The body bumpers are sold at Walmart, Amazon.com, Ebay.com, and Sears.com for $14.88. The main issue with this toy is the possibility of a child sustaining an impact injury. The photo on the box shows two kids bumping into each other with no protective equipment (helmet, knee pads, elbow pads, etc.) which the box clearly says should be worn. ’10 Worst Toys’ of 2016 Called Out By WATCH Safety Group – https://t.co/oBR4Ww9cWS https://t.co/Kfea5e9t5h pic.twitter.com/MdNA26Ej6u — Healthy World (@healthy_wrld) November 15, 2016 NERF RIVAL APOLLO XV-700 BLASTER: The Blaster, manufactured by Hasbro, costs $34.48 and is sold at Walmart.com, Target.com, Amazon.com, and Kmart.com. The packaging encourages “precision battling” during “intense head-to-head competition,” that can lead to eye injuries. Although the box shows kids wearing protective glasses while using the toy, the glasses are not included. THE GOOD DINOSAUR GALLOPING BUTCH: Butch is available at Amazon.com, Walmart.com, and ToyRUs.com for $26.00. “Operation of the dinosaur by children as young as 3- years-old in order to evoke “galloping action and sounds” requires the push of a button on the toy’s rigid, pointed tail, which may be held close to a child’s torso or face,” the press release states. “There exists a potential for significant puncture wound injuries during encouraged playtime activity.” Here you go parents: A watch group says these are the top 10 worst toys for 2016. https://t.co/lsbXiawvNK pic.twitter.com/JSDHztlOGI — KLTV 7 (@KLTV7) November 16, 2016 PEPPY PUPS: Peppy Pups sells at Toys R Us for $19.99. Although it is an adorable toy, it provides risk of strangulation due to the cord, which measures approximately 31 inches when “industry’s standard requiring strings on playpen and crib toys to be less than 12 inches in length.” FLYING HEROES SUPERMAN LAUNCHER: The Superman Launcher costs $16.99, and is available for purchase at Toys R Us, Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Sears.com, Ebay.com, and BigW.com. While the packaging states that children should only launch the superman toy “at arm’s length and pointing up and away from your face…,” if the instructions are not followed, eye and facial injuries could occur. BABY MAGIC FEED AND PLAY BABY: This baby doll sells at Toys R Us, Amazon.com, and Sears.com for $19.99. Ingestion injuries could occur due to the spoon, which measures 2 ¾” long, that comes with the doll; it’s small enough that it could potentially block a child’s airway. WARCRAFT DOOMHAMMER: Doomhammer sells for $9.99 at Toys R Us and Amazon.com. According to the press release, “the manufacturer offers no warnings regarding potential impact injuries associated with foreseeable use of the heavy, rigid plastic battle hammer.” Child Safety Group Names 2016’s ’10 Worst Toys’ https://t.co/bu0riGqFPKpic.twitter.com/pVU5CPDjYU — Baldwin Park Patch (@BaldwinPrkPatch) November 16, 2016 Although these toys are listed as the “10 Worst Toys” of 2016, they are not necessarily the most dangerous on the market. Rather, W.A.T.C.H. chose these particular toys to show different safety regulatory concerns like inconsistent warnings or omissions.

Millennial women (ages 18-34) accounted for about 33 percent of the user base for cosmetics and skincare and almost 50 percent of heavy buyers of both categories (defined by the number product types of each category purchased). Over the last three years, there has been a sharp rise in the amount of cosmetics purchased by Hispanic women and they now account for 15 percent of all category buyers, 24 percent of all heavy buyers of cosmetics, and 20 percent of heavy skincare buyers. The skew in purchasing toward high income purchasers continued, but the study showed a dip in purchasing after $99,000 per year in earnings. “Millennial and Hispanic women are the clear drivers in the beauty market and account for almost 60 percent of all sales,” said Dr. Kurt Jetta, CEO and founder of TABS Analytics. “The beauty and consumer packaged goods industries need to take note of these buyers, including the changes in the brands they are buying and how they are being influenced.” TABS Analytics’ Third Annual Beauty Study was developed to determine what types of beauty products consumers are buying, where those products are purchased, and what social media channels are influencing beauty consumers. One thousand geographically and demographically dispersed female consumers between the ages of 18 and 75 were surveyed for this study in October 2016. The study analyzed the importance of the various shopping channels, including department stores, specialty cosmetic and beauty stores, drug stores and grocery stores. The study also compares Internet and in-home purchases with those of traditional mass-market retailers. Here are some key findings from the study:     YouTube, beauty bloggers, Facebook, and Instagram are top influencers for heavy beauty buyers. The TABS study found that social media was important to 52 percent of heavy buyers of cosmetics in making purchase decisions. This represented a 22 percent jump from 2015 and an 11 percent increase annually over the past 3 years. YouTube drove much of this growth and was the most popular social media popular channel with 35 percent of heavy buyers reporting it was an influential channel for them. Beauty blogs held steady as being important to 29 percent of all heavy buyers. Facebook tied with Instagram in having the second biggest increase in influence among all buyers, and jumped from 17 percent in 2015 to 25 percent in 2016 among heavy buyers. Instagram increased in importance with heavy buyers from 19 percent in 2015 to 22 percent in 2016. One third of consumers also reported that online reviews influence their choices.     Winners in 2016 tended to be in mass market, with Walmart reasserting its market leading position in Beauty sales. Walmart led all retailers across channels with 17 percent of all sector purchases. Walmart’s results demonstrate that it can be a strong force in cosmetics sales, especially after bringing in mass niche brands to its assortment mix during 2016. Dollar store growth was driven by the channel’s strength in the multi-cultural niche. The big non-mass market winner was the specialty beauty chain Sephora, which increased growth compared to last year primarily because of the increase in the number of stores, both with stand-alone stores and with Sephora within J.C. Penney format stores.     Target, CVS, Macy’s and Nordstrom slip. Although Target finished second in the mass market channel behind Walmart with 9 percent of all purchases, it declined from 10 percent in 2015. Department stores’ share of purchases slid compared to 2015. Both Macy’s and Nordstrom’s cosmetics shares of purchases were down. This decline reported in the survey is consistent with soft sales reported by these specific retailers in their report filings.     Online sales bounced back. Online sales reversed their decline from last year and now represent 9 percent of all beauty transactions, and over 10 percent of dollar sales, amounting to approximately $2.5 billion annually. Amazon dominates sales in the channel, outselling cosmetics websites by more than a 2-to-1 ratio.     Almost fifty percent of retail dollars are in the non-mass market channels, but share is down slightly from 2015. The 2016 decline in share of purchases reported by the TABS study is primarily because of the growth of the mass market channel, driven by Walmart. Specialty beauty stores are responsible for 16 percent of all purchases. Surprisingly, Ulta was flat in 2016 with a 5.5 percent share of purchases after seeing strong growth in 2015. Last year’s 2015 TABS Analytics Study was an early predictor of Ulta quarterly reports showing very strong growth in same store sales.     Newer brands are gaining in awareness and picking up growth. Although the top brands including Cover Girl, Maybelline, L’Oréal, Revlon, Neutrogena and Clinique maintained their predominance in key awareness, penetration and favorability metrics, a number of newer niche brands are breaking through in consumer popularity. NYX, e.l.f., Milani, Jordana, Black Radiance, Urban Decay and Boots all had double digit growth in awareness compared to last year.     Category dynamics for skincare are very similar to cosmetics. However, skincare tends to skew more towards mass market compared to cosmetics, with a larger number of mass market brands showing high awareness. Otherwise, the demographic, attitudinal and behavioral characteristics for skincare are consistent with cosmetics.     Offering good deals is the top factor in driving consumer outlet preference. Over 50 percent of consumers surveyed consistently state that promotional incentives and deals are important to them and that they like to shop at stores with “good deals.”     The beauty advisor model is becoming obsolete. In-store beauty advisors are not a driver of preference. The TABS Survey shows that only 15 percent of consumers rated beauty advisors as important in the 2016 survey, down 5 percentage points from 20 percent in 2015. “The beauty category has maintained healthy growth in 2016, but that growth decelerated somewhat from our last study,” commented Dr. Jetta. “If these studies tell us anything, it is that there is still an insatiable demand for these younger users to directly engage with the products in terms of active research and trial of new products as well as new brands. Unlike most categories where we tend to see a shakeout of smaller brands, the pie of brands seems to be getting much bigger in beauty.” About TABS Analytics Operating since 1998, TABS Analytics, formerly TABS Group, based in Shelton, Conn., is a technology-enabled analytics firm.

Talking Turkeys  What's behind the high cost of locally farmed holiday birds? By Alison Leininger Tools del.icio.us Facebook Twitter Email Print Add to favorites Saving… Add to Custom List Loading… Comments New Town Farms 704-843-5182. newtownfarms.com Middle Ground Farm 585-370-1734. middleground.farm It has begun. Every week, grocery store ads push holiday turkey prices ever lower; 99 cents a pound here, 89 cents a pound there. Walmart has had whole birds selling for 69 cents a pound since the beginning of the month. Eventually some stores will just give birds away as a promotion. The next logical step will be to have Harris Teeter pay us to take home the plumpest, juiciest Butterball to grace our Thanksgiving tables. Meanwhile, in the calm green swath of Waxhaw that is New Town Farm, Sammy Koenigsberg gazes over his small flock of broad-breasted whites and quietly says, "I think we're at $7 [a pound] now." All of his 60 plus birds are spoken for, reserved with $40 deposits and a waiting list to boot. Many will cost over $100 when delivered fresh during Thanksgiving week. The typical American shopper hunts down the most food for the fewest dollars, but a growing collection of local eaters spring for the gold standard at the holidays, paying big bucks for locally pastured birds. With such a wide divide in prices, this annual turkey fest serves as a prime example of the disparity between commercially grown food, and that raised on smaller, sustainably-minded farms. Google "turkey barn," and you'll pull up image after image of vast manmade caverns carpeted with white-feathered bodies standing wing-to-wattle — and not doing much else. As with other meats, modern commercial turkey growers practice confinement farming, factoring out weather, predators and other natural risks while pursuing established formulas for pounds of feed in, pounds of meat out. Anyone following the country's food debates knows there are disadvantages here: crowded birds get sick, so prophylactic antibiotics are added to the feed, facilitating the development of super-resistant diseases transferable to humans. Hormones boost growth, creating behemoth bids incapable of supporting their own weight. Injured birds are often trampled by their flock-mates, lost to the crowded conditions. Yet the system does what it's designed to do, pumping out over five billion pounds of affordable turkey every year, according to the USDA. Sammy Koenigsberg of New Town Farm in Waxhaw. On Koenigsberg's farm, five dozen turkeys spread out across a small sunlit pasture, chirruping in surprisingly musical tones as they explore the grass, their feeders, or visitors crouching down for a photograph. These may be happy birds, but the bucolic scene carries its own risks. Predators, weather and the birds themselves all pose threats at different stages of development. Down the road in Monroe, "Farmer Dan" Kypena is only on his second year of turkey raising. Before adding them to Middle Ground Farm, he turned for advice to Koenigsberg and his 20 years of experience. "He told me, 'Look, if you wind up with better than 50 or 60 percent surviving, job well done,'" says Kypena. True to form, Kypena started out with 24 birds, and a week prior to processing them, was down to 13. "In the early stages, when you're brooding them, they're really fragile," he says. When the day-old chicks arrive in July or August, they spend two or three weeks in brooders, small enclosures equipped with heat lamps keeping the temperature around 90 degrees. Anything colder can be deadly. Koenigsberg recalls standing outside his roofed brooding shed blocking a hard September rain with tarps, but still incurring heavy losses. Post-brooder, the turkeys go through a two-stage graduation onto pasture, first inside open-bottomed mobile coops, and then onto open grass hemmed by movable electric netting. Both are relocated every day, sometimes twice a day, making them more labor-intensive than large-scale commercial barns. This open-air housing also exposes the flock to possible predator attacks, especially from coyotes and raptors. Inside the larger pasture, Koenigsberg points to netting hanging down one open end of a high arched shelter, designed to deter nighttime owl raids. "We had one move where we had left both sides open," he says, "and that night we lost three birds." Even if the predators don't succeed in catching a turkey, they can send the flock into such a panic that some birds are crushed in a pileup or a stampede. Middle Ground Farm uses livestock guardian dogs to protect all its livestock. Inside the turkey pasture, a large white Great Pyrenees-Anatolian mix named Chunk keeps watch day and night. An innocuous great blue heron cruising over the neighbor's land sends every dog on the farm to that end of the property with echoing barks. "We have not lost a single animal to predators," Kypena says. Aside from the greater risks and labor involved in raising turkeys on pasture, both these farmers have assumed additional costs in using certified organic feed — even foraging birds need additional feed to reach weight in time for Thanksgiving. Kypena quotes a price of $30 per 50-pound bag, while he says a hog farmer he knows buys conventional feed by the ton — 2,000 pounds — for $160. Still, Koenigsberg finds turkeys to be a profitable late-season addition to his farm's revenue, providing a "getcha through the winter" cash infusion. But for both men, the birds provide other important, if less tangible benefits to the small farmer. "Turkeys are a very enjoyable creature to raise," says Koenigsberg. "They sing when they get to new pastures; they come running to you when you walk out to them, and not just for food. They would follow us back to the house if there weren't a fence." Bronze turkeys from Middle Ground Farm in Monroe. The two farmers also find satisfaction in raising turkeys "the right way," as Kypena says. He enjoys watching the birds live a healthy lifestyle, even posting a video online demonstrating their ability to run. "You show me a factory-farmed bird that can run like that," he says. And, as Koenigsberg says, in addition to more flavorful meat, pasture-raised birds also provide the consumer "the knowledge that this bird lived a good life, and was treated with compassion as a creature. This is perhaps the most important ingredient in a meal."
