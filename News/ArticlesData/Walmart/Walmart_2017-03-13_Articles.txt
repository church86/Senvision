(WLS) WLS By Sarah Schulte Tuesday, March 14, 2017 04:01PM CHICAGO, IL -- A person is in custody after a shooting in a Walmart parking lot in southwest Chicago, police said. One person was hospitalized with a gunshot wound, and another was hospitalized after being struck by a vehicle, said Bedford Park Police Chief Daniel Godfrey. Police said the people in two vehicles were allegedly flashing gang signs to each other while driving. The vehicles pulled into the Walmart parking lot where one vehicle reportedly stopped, and two people got out. Police said the driver of the second vehicle ran over one of the people who exited the first vehicle. Then there was gunfire, according to police, and the driver of the striking vehicle was shot at least once in the face. Inside the store, there was chaos as employees and customers were trying to figure out what was happening. "I was waiting for a cab. I saw people running, women running, men running, I was running, too," said shopper Angela Jernagin. Customers and employees were told to go to the back of the store. Some began posting pictures on social media as they were trying to reach family members. Eventually, police allowed everyone to leave. Some employees who were working later shifts came to check on their coworkers. "A lot of them are shaken up," said employee David Pineda. "I was so scared for my life. I didn't know what was going on. I know I was getting out of the way, I didn't want to get hit with bullets," Jenigan said. No word on whether charges have been filed.

Top Retailers>Walmart Walmart CEO cites growing importance of private label Store brands seen as driver of margins, loyalty Mark Hamstra 1 | Mar 14, 2017 With national brand grocery product increasingly available through pure-play e-commerce retailers such as Amazon, Walmart sees its private label brands, such as Great Value, playing a bigger role in the company’s success going forward. The widespread availability of name-brand products online will compress the margins of those products over time, said Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Walmart, speaking at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2017 Consumer & Retail Technology Conference in New York on Tuesday. “Having a private brand from a margin mix point of view has always been important, but it is even more important now,” McMillon (left) said. Walmart has undertaken a significant effort to improve its sourcing capabilities in private label, an effort led by David Cheesewright, president and CEO of WalMart International, as the company seeks to improve both the quality and the profit margins of those items. The company, which has long relied on offering “name brands for less,” is increasingly looking for its private labels to drive loyalty, he explained. “If we have engineered our specs so that you really love our granola, then there’s a loyalty there that passes not just through the store but into the e-commerce business as well,” said McMillon. “Product-driven loyalty becomes even more important than it was in the past.” Battling Lidl Product attributes including quality and package size are also key to battling the expected rollout of German discounter Lidl in the U.S., McMillon said, citing Walmart’s experience competing against hard-discounter Aldi in the U.S. and against both Aldi and Lidl in the U.K. “It starts with assortment,” he said. “We’ve got to make sure that the quality of our merchandise is right, not just the price.” Product package sizes are important, “so it is easy for a customer to compare one item against another,” McMillon added. “Product engineering has to come first, and pricing has to come second.” In addition, shopping has to be quick and easy for customers, even in large Supercenters, he said, so they can better compete against the small, easy-to-shop formats of Aldi and Lidl. “We need to innovate for speed, so people can find the item they need to get in and out of the store quickly,” he said. “We are going to try to take away the advantages the discounters have, and then play to our strengths.” Responding to a question about how Wal-Mart is working with its suppliers to achieve its efforts around price reductions, McMillon said that cutting back on advertising and promotions will help. He said the company had “drifted away” from its core EDLP model and was running too many promotions in print ads. By cutting back on promotions, Walmart is asking its vendors for less ad funding and instead focusing on negotiating off-invoice pricing, McMillon said. Improving store pickup Walmart is also refining its click-and-collect grocery operations to make them more efficient at the store level, he said. “Our customers love [store] pickup,” McMillon said, citing high customer-satisfaction scores around the service. Now that Walmart has been providing the service for a while — it has expanded to more than 600 locations — it has learned how to better organize its stores to manage the offering, he said. “The physical store is improving as it relates to pickup,” said McMillon. “We are learning how to manage the outside experience so it’s faster, and we are learning how to build the back room so inventory can be moved from in-store pickup to exterior pickup quickly and easily.” Stores have also begun locating refrigeration close to the pickup area to improve speed of service, he said. Those same refinements are also helping the company as it gears up to expand home delivery, he said. McMillon noted, however, that delivery will likely only account for a small percentage of orders. In the U.K., where Walmart’s ASDA banner has been offering delivery for more than 15 years, “well over 90%” of sales volume is still done in-store, he said. Walmart has also learned that click-and-collect and delivery services need scale to be economically viable. In some areas, the company has found that using a single store to supply pickup and home delivery for other nearby locations is more efficient. “It actually does make sense in some cases to have a hub, picking and delivering to other stores, and to the home,” McMillon said. “We are figuring out where to do it, and where not to do it.” Walmart still sees its Supercenters as the backbone of the company’s success, he said, noting that the company continues to experiment with different Supercenter formats and designs. Two of the newest Supercenter prototypes in Lake Nona, Fla., near Orlando, and in Tomball, Texas, in the Houston market, display features that will be incorporated in other stores going forward, McMillon said, although he did not reveal which specific features would be rolled out further. As previously reported, the Lake Nona store includes an organic restaurant, called Grown, offers a mobile “scan-and-go” app, in-store order kiosks and includes enhancements around store pickup. The stores also feature a bright, modern layout and an expanded offering of perishables. These newest stores “represent some of our latest thinking in supercenter design, and that might give you some idea of where we might allocate some of our remodel dollars going forward,” McMillon said.

Most Popular The name denotes smallness, but body wash Le Petit Marseillais is big in France. Now Johnson & Johnson hopes it can attain similar stature in the U.S. with a relatively small budget and full distribution at retail giant Walmart, as the company for the first time launches a beauty brand here with no TV. Le Petit Marseillais is France's leading body wash, used in more than half the country's households and already sold in more than 20 countries worldwide. Launched originally in the 1980s and acquired by J&J in 2006, it started its U.S. launch last month with five body wash products backed by digital and social media plus scented magazine ads. The brand rolls into Walmart's specialty bath and body sections with a fuller 17-item line that includes body lotions on March 16. The U.S. launch, which follows successful expansion for into Russia and Turkey last year, is handled by DDB, Paris, which handles the brand globally. "We're not following the traditional launch model using TV," said Jorge Mesquita, worldwide chairman of J&J Consumer Cos., in a presentation at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference last month. "We're creating a grassroots movement for LPM by using digital media as our primary source." "I think a digital-first approach has worked," said Dawn Kidd, senior marketing director at J&J in an interview, who said the brand is off to a fast start. The introduction has included backing from social-media influencers who have French roots, such as Christina Caradona, a beauty blogger who grew up in France and New York. Ads include Google search and Facebook, with the brand already logging a million likes in the U.S. Its video featuring line drawings of its trademark sailor boy bringing the brand to the U.S. got more than 630,000 views in two weeks. Comments on the video are heavy with fond remembrances among people who've encountered the brand in France and look forward to finding it in U.S. stores. Ms. Kidd said the brand "conveys the sunniness and joie de vivre of being in the south of France in Provence" and has gotten a 1-5% share in markets it's recently entered. "We feel like the U.S. market is perfect," she said. "There's a lot of fondness for everything French." That includes, she hopes, at Walmart, with a mid-tier value price ahead of Colgate-Palmolive Co.'s Softsoap but a bit below Unilever's Dove and well below J&J's own Neutrogena or OGX. Like the latter, Le Petit Marseilles has a natural positioning, including olive-oil-based soap and ingredients such as Mediterranean algae, marine minerals, beeswax and orange blossoms. Correction: An earlier version of the story mistakenly said Le Petit Marseillais ranks among the top five body-wash brands in every market it's entered up to now. The brand has gotten a 1-5% share in new markets it's recently entered.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 14 March 2017 by Military News Is TripAdvisor Inc the Next Buyout Candidate in the Online Travel Industry? On this episode of Market Foolery , Mac Greer is joined by Motley Fool analysts Ron Gross and Matt Argersinger as they open the mailbag to respond to three listener questions: How do companies manage their massive stock buybacks? Is it possible that Priceline (NASDAQ: PCLN) and Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE)  are both pursuing TripAdvisor (NASDAQ: TRIP) right now? And is taking profits on your big stock winners a good way to rebalance, or just trimming your flowers and watering your weeds? A full transcript follows the video. 10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks  for investors to buy right now… and Wal-Mart wasn’t one of them! That’s right — they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. Click here  to learn about these picks! *Stock Advisor returns as of March 6, 2017 The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned. This podcast was recorded on March 8, 2017. Mac Greer:  It’s Wednesday, March 8th. Welcome to Market Foolery . I’m Mac Greer. Joining me in studio we have Ron Gross, from Motley Fool Total Income, and Matt Argersinger, from Million Dollar Portfolio . Gentlemen, welcome! Matt Argersinger:  Thanks, Mac! Ron Gross: How you doing, Mac? Greer:  Guys, I’m doing well, and we’re going to try something a little different today. We are going with an all mailbag episode. Fool mailbag, OK? Gross:  OK. I’m in. Like I have a choice. Greer:  You have no choice. We’re going to begin with a question about stock buybacks from Tom Smith from Antioch, California. Tom also identifies himself as listener No. 13, and he’s a Stock Advisor and Rule Your Retirement member. Gross:  A baker’s dozen! Greer:  A baker’s dozen. And he’s a member, so bump up your game. Tom’s question: How are stock buybacks actually done? For example, did Home Depot  just put $15 billion in their Schwab  account and then put in a limit order? It seems like they have to be careful not to make huge purchases that would shoot their stock price up, too. I’m just curious as to the mechanics of the repurchase process. Ron Gross? Gross:  Nothing says good podcasts like the mechanics of stock buybacks, but I will refer everyone to SEC rule 10b-18. Of course, I’m sure most of us are familiar with it. Greer:  Wow. This is where we lower expectations. Argersinger:  This is getting interesting. Gross:  No, but the bottom line is, yes, you do certainly need a broker. It’s not your Schwab account, it’s an actual human being who can work and order for you and make trades for you. There’s many, many rules associated with stock buybacks, a big one being that you can’t be in possession of material nonpublic information, so insider information, which is actually kind of hard, because everything is inside when you work for a company. But it can’t be really material, something that you know will affect the stock either way. You only can use one broker in any given day. You can’t have many brokers out there putting out different bids for a stock for you, for example. You can’t buy more than 25% of the daily volume. You can’t be the first trade of the day, you can’t trade in the last 30 minutes of the day. Lots and lots of different rules you must follow to keep everything on the up-and-up. Once you get the hang of it, it’s not too hard to stay compliant. Argersinger:  I’d say it’s fair to say that Home Depot is not opening a discount brokerage account at Charles Schwab . They obviously have a specialist, probably someone at a major brokerage or investment bank that’s able to buy in bulk, I would imagine. That’s generally how it works. Greer:  Related question here: When are stock buybacks a bullish indicator, and when should investors beware? Gross:  The easiest thing to say is, it’s a great use of capital when the stock is undervalued. But how do you judge that? That’s the trick. Companies, history has shown, will often buy their stock back at the wrong time, when the stocks are someone overvalued, and that is a terrible use of capital, and it destroys shareholder value. So, you have to be careful. Another reason I hate to see stock buybacks is when the company is trying to offset the dilution caused by issuing options to its employees. I understand why it’s done, but you don’t want to see that, typically, as a good use of capital. So, if they have a lot of cash, they don’t have growth opportunities for all of it, they see their stock as being a great growth opportunity at a good price, then go for it, buy all the stock you can back. Greer:  Our second email comes from Gilly Beaman. Gilly asks, what are the odds that Priceline and Expedia are both calling TripAdvisor at the same time to discuss an acquisition? Matt? Argersinger:  Ah, yeah, Gilly, I think with TripAdvisor at a five-year low, the odds are probably as good as they’ve ever been right now. And there’s been rumors in recent years about an acquisition. I think the best fit is probably Priceline. One, it would really boost Priceline’s share of U.S. travel customers. We know booking.com is their big platform. Super popular in Europe. Not so huge here in the U.S. So, it really boosts their marketing potential here in the U.S. TripAdvisor has 350 million unique visitors each month. That’s a huge number. Something like almost 400 million reviews. Mac, I know that you’re responsible for at least a dozen or so reviews. Greer:  I am. I get their emails, I’m one of their top-rated reviewers, at least in this ZIP code. Gross:  Wow, we’re here with royalty. Greer:  That’s right. Argersinger:  So, there are a lot of eyeballs that Priceline can gain by buying TripAdvisor. And TripAdvisor has this growing activities business, which is getting some kind of scale. If you think about Priceline as mostly getting people to the destination, while TripAdvisor has things they can actually do when they get to the destination. So, it helps Priceline become more of a one-stop shop OTA. What I’ll say though, in reality, I don’t think Priceline will ever get the chance, because I think Expedia would be — if TripAdvisor was compelling enough — they would actually be the one to make the acquisition. And that’s because there’s a strong relationship between TripAdvisor and Expedia through Liberty Interactive . And I’ll explain that for those who don’t know, and you kind of have to bear with me here. Barry Diller and John Malone, longtime friends, occasional business partners. Diller is Expedia’s chairman. Liberty Interactive, which is controlled by John Malone, owns 16% of Expedia. Liberty Interactive, in turn, owns a controlling stake in TripAdvisor through its Liberty TripAdvisor tracking stock. Gross:  For those that are still with us — Argersinger:  It goes on. The CEO of Liberty Interactive, Greg Maffei, also happens to be the chairman of TripAdvisor. Gross:  Am I crazy, or wasn’t TripAdvisor spun out of Expedia? Argersinger:  It was. It’s not controlled by Expedia except to the extent that Liberty Interactive has a stake in Expedia and TripAdvisor. Greer:  At this point, I almost want to go back to the stock buyback discussion. [laughs] Argersinger:  I think, at today’s price, an acquisition of TripAdvisor looks compelling to both. But I would say Expedia has, probably, the first dibs. Priceline would have to make a very compelling case and pay a pretty big premium. Gross: And Priceline is a much bigger company, $85 billion or so, versus Expedia at $18 billion, TripAdvisor now, as Matt said, only a $6 billion company in. So you could get this done with stock, or even low-cost debt if you wanted to. But Priceline is more likely. Greer: See, I like the Expedia angle because I like Priceline, I love the reviews, I contribute reviews and I post reviews, but I don’t buy and I don’t transact — I’m sorry, I just blew that. I love TripAdvisor. I contribute reviews, I read reviews. But the problem for me and TripAdvisor is I don’t transact through TripAdvisor. I find the hotel or the place I like, and then I go to Expedia, or I go to the hotel’s website. If Expedia buys them, then it’s that one-stop shop, I could book my flight on Expedia, I could book my hotel on Expedia, and I can read the reviews. Argersinger:  That’s absolutely right, and that’s the challenge. TripAdvisor is trying to move to that booking platform where you can do everything there. Greer: Inertia, I’m not doing it. Argersinger:  [laughs] You’re right. So, something like an Expedia acquisition accelerates that, and makes that redundant. Greer: Our third email comes from Jerry Valanni from Cleveland, Ohio. Jerry writes: Due to the great market over the past year I have a few stocks in my portfolio that have doubled since I bought them. I have been reading up on the strategy of selling half a position when the position doubles. The pro seems to be locking in profits and rebalancing your portfolio. The con seems to be cutting in a half a potential huge winner. I was wondering what your thoughts were on this. Argersinger:  Jerry, I’d say the con is pretty strong for us. We have a term hear at the Fool, and I’m not sure if David Gardner coined it or if he was the first to use it, but it’s called trimming your flowers and watering your weeds. Jerry, that sounds a little bit like what you’re thinking about doing. In most cases, you actually want to do the exact opposite. You really want to add to your winners and sell your losers, in most cases. But have a healthy biased toward holding on to your winners as long as you can. And, I’d say, especially if you have high conviction in the company, you don’t need the cash immediately, and, of course, if you don’t see better opportunities elsewhere. If that’s all going for you, I would always lean toward holding onto your winners. Gross: Yeah. I take a little bit more of a value investor slant to that, although I won’t completely disagree with Matty. In fact, I won’t disagree with a lot of that. But for me, it boils down to two things: Do you think the stock still has market-beating potential? If it doesn’t, you probably shouldn’t own any of it, if you really want to take a value investor perspective. But if you think it does, then own as much as you like. The second thing is: Can you sleep at night? If a stock is 20% to 40% of your portfolio, is it literally affecting your sleep? If not, maybe it’s OK. For me, it’s not. I don’t typically go over 10%. That’s a big number for me. Everyone is different. But for me, the bottom line is, it’s not how big of an allocation you have, it’s what is the future potential of the stock? Greer: And guys, Jerry also had some thoughts on how Starbucks could solve its traffic problem. You may have read recently that Starbucks, with the popularity of its mobile ordering system, a lot of in-store traffic. Here’s Jerry’s idea: After listening to your report that Starbucks’ problem is too many orders at morning rush hour, it got me to thinking that maybe they should institute Uber-like surge pricing. During the morning rush, it’s $0.10 or $0.20 more, and then cheaper in the afternoon when demand is slow. Gross: So Jerry got two questions here today? Greer: It’s a question and a comment. Gross: OK. The business term for what he’s talking about, Uber’s surge pricing, but it’s dynamic pricing. And most pricing is based on demand, and supply, for that matter. But typically, it doesn’t get adjusted intra-day like you could see in surge pricing with Uber. But, a great example would be airlines. Airlines fluctuate their prices based on demand and the seat supply all the time. Auto dealerships do it, bars have happy hours where they charge less of a price at the time of day where it’s not typically crowded. Greer: I’ve heard of that. Gross: [laughs] There’s dynamic pricing all over the place. Disneyland is starting. I read a great article that really summarizes all the ways dynamic pricing is currently being used. The problem is, there’s going to be backlash. There’s backlash at Uber. People hate the surge pricing. There have been giant periods of time where they’ve had to phase it out, it still remains, however. If you go to Starbucks and you end up leaving angry that you paid more than you would have if you had waited a half hour, I have a feeling that won’t work. Argersinger:  Yeah. I think with quick serve restaurants — it’s not fair to put Starbucks in that category — but there is a transparency of pricing that’s pretty important. So I think if you walked into a Starbucks and you’re thinking, „I know what I want, but I don’t know how much it’s going to cost until I go up to the cashier,” that creates an interesting dilemma. But I have to say, I think Jerry is onto something here. I think dynamic pricing, as Ron described really well, that’s something that can work for more and more industries. And I think because we are an on-demand consumer now, we’re willing to pay more if our time is more important to us in certain cases. So I like the idea. Gross: I think the stock market is the biggest example of dynamic pricing. The pricing changes literally by the second based on supply and demand. And we seem to accept that. So, I think it could translate elsewhere. Greer: But, do you think, in our situation, we have a Starbucks and a Dunkin’ Donuts right by the office. If Starbucks did something like this and hiked the price of coffee $0.10 to $0.20 in the morning, could they get away with that? I already go to Dunkin’, so I’m probably not the best example, but do you think they could get away with that? Argersinger:  You’ll start seeing, like with gasoline, they put the prices out front, and it’s like, „Oh, it’s $0.20 cheaper over here, I’ll go here.” I’ll walk an extra two blocks to save myself $0.20 on a cup of coffee. I don’t know. Gross: The toll roads have it now based on the demand for the express lane. They have the prices change up and down. And for me, it remains to be seen. It sometimes can backfire, and you have the opposite reaction that you want folks to have, ends up happening. So you run into Dunkin’ Donuts instead because you’re angry at Starbucks? That could be a problem. Argersinger:  It really is fascinating, because it is the value placed on time. I’ve been in lines many times where I thought, „I will pay an extra $1 if I can get out of here in two minutes as opposed to waiting 15 or 20 minutes.” That happens all the time.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 14 March 2017 by Military News One Put, One Call Option To Know About for Wal-Mart Stores Shutterstock photo Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist at Stock Options Channel is Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Symbol: WMT). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the April expiration for WMT. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $67.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 66 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1% return against the $67.50 commitment, or a 7.8% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ). Selling a put does not give an investor access to WMT’s upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. sees its shares decline 3.4% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $66.84 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the 66 cents from $67.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 7.8% annualized rate of return. Worth considering, is that the annualized 7.8% figure actually exceeds the 2.9% annualized dividend paid by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. by 4.9%, based on the current share price of $69.97. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 3.36% to reach the $67.50 strike price. Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., looking at the dividend history chart for WMT below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.9% annualized dividend yield. Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the April expiration, for shareholders of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Symbol: WMT) looking to boost their income beyond the stock’s 2.9% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $70.50 strike and collecting the premium based on the $1.21 bid, annualizes to an additional 13.8% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost ), for a total of 16.7% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $70.50 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but WMT shares would have to climb 0.9% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 2.7% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called. The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., highlighting in green where the $67.50 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $70.50 strike in red: The chart above, and the stock’s historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the April put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (considering the last 251 trading day WMT historical stock prices using closing values, as well as today’s price of $69.97) to be 18%. In mid-afternoon trading on Monday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 685,332 contracts, with call volume at 685,332, for a put:call ratio of 0.73 so far for the day, which is above normal compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65. In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we’d expect to see, we’re actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in options trading so far today. Find out which 15 call and put options traders are talking about today .

Revenue, excluding currency, increased 3% to $133.6 billion in retailer's fourth quarter 2016. Comparable store sales in the Walmart U.S. business grew 1.8%, driven by a 1.4% increase in customer traffic. As the industry tries to adapt to a new omnichannel reality, Walmart has been accelerating its e-commerce growth after acquiring Jet.com last year and bringing on Marc Lore as CEO of Walmart's U.S. e-commerce business. "We saw strong growth this quarter in the Walmart U.S. e-commerce business with GMV and sales growth of 36% and 29%, respectively," said Brett Biggs, EVP and CFO. The company also saw an uptick in its e-commerce business since its January 31 switch to free two-day shipping with a minimum order of $35.  "Our integrated offering means customers are shopping with us through multiple channels. In fact, over the holidays, Pickup Today, which is available in Walmart U.S. stores, grew by 27% over last year," said Biggs. Over the holidays, wait times were down for Pickup and the retailer is adding more items to Pickup Today. "Customers love being able to order an item with an app and get it that day," explained CEO Doug McMillon. Walmart said it is now the second-largest U.S. online retailer by revenue, one of the top three online retailers by traffic and its Walmart app is among the top three apps in retail. Walmart is rolling out new capabilities in the Walmart app in March and a new store experience that allows customers to skip traditional service lines using “express lanes” in these areas. The app will now allow for easy refills of prescriptions and simplified money transferring where the shopper can fill out information on the app ahead of time instead of filling out paperwork in store. After using the app for either of these service shoppers will be able to use the “express lane” to move to the front of the line. The new capabilities are expected to be available in Walmart’s 4,700 stores by fall. “These capabilities are the latest example of how we’re bringing together all of the conveniences of Walmart – great stores, convenient pickup, easy checkout and a top-notch app – to deliver one seamless shopping experience for customers,” said Daniel Eckert, SVP, Walmart Services. Updates to the app aren’t surprising as mobile becomes increasingly important for Walmart. Black Friday weekend sales marked the first time the number of people shopping online surpassed people shopping in stores for Walmart, and over half did through mobile devices. Further, more than 70% of traffic to Walmart.com during Black Friday and Cyber Monday was driven by mobile.  Inside the workforce, Walmart said new technology and apps are providing real-time information to improve its in-stock levels and better manage inventory, which is down 7% this quarter versus last year on a comp-store basis. The company has also been experimenting with customer experience initiatives, opening two new Supercenters in Florida and Texas, with features like scan-and-go, touch-screens where customers can access more items on Walmart.com, virtual item displays, and an integrated Health & Wellness section. Customer expectations continue to change rapidly, noted McMillon. "They will increasingly expect even more personalization and convenience in their shopping experience. We’re moving quickly to respond to the current opportunities as well as to innovate and transform the shopping experience for our customers in the future."     RELATED LINKS Customer Engagement Tech Trends Study: The Personalization Imperative The Fulfillment Revolution: Adapting Slow Systems for Fast-Moving Shoppers An Engaged Workforce is the Key to Prolonged Omnichannel Success Strategies to Maximize the Peak Selling Season POST A COMMENT Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus RATE THIS CONTENT (5 Being the Best) Rating Rating Rating Rating Rating 1 2 3 4 5 Current rating: 0 (0 ratings) Tweet Add To Favorite Email Print Text Size + − MOST READ STORIES 10 Most Valuable Retail Brands Top 10 Biggest U.S. Retailers Top 10 Highest Rated Retail CEOs Top 5 and Bottom 5 Retailers of Q1 JCPenney COO Calls Legacy IT Systems Major Hurdle in Turnaround Efforts TRENDAGRAMMore > Digital Promotion: How Grocers Are Driving Sales topicsMore > Omnichannel Merchandising Innovation Mobility Customer Experience Marketing/ Promotions Store Systems Analytics RIS EVENTS Follow us on <script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript" src="http://edgell.nui.media/pipeline/205684/0/vj?z=edgell&amp;dim=1886&amp;kw=&amp;click=&amp;abr=$scriptiniframe"></script><noscript><a href="http://edgell.nui.media/pipeline/205684/0/cc?z=edgell"><img src="http://edgell.nui.media/pipeline/205684/0/vc?z=edgell&amp;dim=1886&amp;kw=&amp;click=&amp;abr=$imginiframe" width="728" height="90" alt="" border="0" /></a></noscript> Contact Us Editorial Board Media Kit Privacy Statement Terms & Conditions 8550 W.

(Republican File ) Print Email Jim Kinney | jkinney@repub.com By Jim Kinney | jkinney@repub.com The Republican Follow on Twitter on March 14, 2017 at 7:50 AM comments BOSTON -- Walmart announced Monday that 8,000 Massachusetts employees will share in $1.6 million in quarterly bonuses based on their store's performance in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Massachusetts payouts are part of $157 million nationwide paid to 850,000 Walmart associates in the U.S., according to a news release. Walmart U.S. had recorded its strongest sales performance of the year in the fourth quarter, the company said. It was a 1.8 percent increase in the fourth quarter. The bonuses, along with an annual pay raise, were included in their March 9 paychecks, Walmart said. For the full fiscal year, U.S. associates shared more than $700 million in bonuses, the company said. Walmart also touted its program to advance and promote workers: * Walmart U.S. promoted more than 200,000 associates, including 2,397 in Massachusetts, to jobs with higher pay and more responsibility. * More than 150,000 associates, including 1,285 in Massachusetts were converted from part-time to full-time. The profit sharing and bonuses come after Walmart sustained several years of public protests and criticism relating to the wages paid to associates.  MASSLIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA MassLive News on Facebook MassLive News on Twitter MassLive on YouTube Breaking News newsletter When the big stories break, we'll send you an alert.

(KTRK) KTRK Monday, March 13, 2017 09:50PM HOUSTON (KTRK) -- A wild scene was caught on camera in the parking lot of a Walmart in west Houston. In the video, a man suspected of checking car doors to see if they were unlocked was held at gunpoint by a potential victim. The potential victim and his wife had been watching the suspect from inside their vehicle, according to a Facebook post. When the suspect approached, the man pulled out his gun to subdue him. The man was taken to a hospital on an emergency detention order, but the DA's office did not press any charges against him.

By George Avalos | gavalos@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: March 13, 2017 at 4:03 pm | UPDATED: March 14, 2017 at 4:14 am SAN BRUNO — Walmart.com plans to hire hundreds of workers for its Bay Area tech operations in a push to offer free two-day shipping for online orders, mounting a challenge to Amazon Prime. The hiring is expected to more than offset recent job cuts of about 175 Walmart.com workers on the Peninsula. “We are in the process of hiring hundreds of merchandise and category specialists for Walmart.com,” said Ravi Jariwala, a spokesman for Walmart.com, the digital arm of the Arkansas-based retailing titan. At present, Walmart.com employs about 2,300 people in the Bay Area, primarily on the Peninsula. “As we grow the team, we’ll be adding positions both in Sunnyvale and San Bruno,” Jariwala said. Walmart is seeking to improve the customer experience, so it’s shifting resources and investments to that effort. “We recently launched free two-day shipping on orders of $35 or more, no subscription required,” Jariwala said. That’s a direct challenge to the Amazon.com offering of free two-day shipping for customers who have signed up for the Amazon Prime service, which costs $99 a year, or $10.99 a month. The Walmart.com initiatives highlight the pressure retailers face in competing with each other and with Amazon’s vast array of goods and services. “Every traditional retailer is trying to come up with a winning formula for its online channel,” said Mark Vitner, a senior economist with Wells Fargo. Hiring even while laying off other workers is typical of a number of tech companies these days. Case in point: Mountain View-based Google has filed papers with state labor officials detailing plans to eliminate about 200 jobs in Mountain View during March and April. Yet Google owner Alphabet had 72,000 workers worldwide at the end of 2016, up 10,200 employees from the headcount at the end of 2015, regulatory filings show. “Any time tech companies aren’t able to show growth in a particular area, they often must pivot quickly into a more promising area,” Vitner said. Walmart.com also is pushing, through its online grocery options, free pickup of groceries bought on the Walmart website. “Customers tell us they’re excited about online grocery because they’re putting the time they’re saving back into meaningful parts of their lives,” Michael Bender, chief operating officer of Walmart Global eCommerce, wrote in an April 2016 blog post. The retailing giant also has bought e-commerce firms Jet.com, Shoebuy and Moosejaw in a series of transactions in September 2016 and January and February of 2017. “We are shifting our investments and building up teams that can launch two-day shipping and other customer-facing initiatives that further enhance the digital shopping experience,” Jariwala said.

Cicero just before 12:30 p.m.  Authorities said the occupants of two vehicles traveling on Cicero Avenue were allegedly displaying gang signs to each other before they pulled into the Walmart parking lot.  One vehicle stopped and two people got out before the driver of the other vehicle ran over one of them. That’s when police say shots were fired and the driver who allegedly ran the man over was shot.  Two people were taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn where they were reported to be in stable condition. The third person was taken into custody pending an investigation.  Walmart said in a statement the situation at the Bedford Park location “is an ongoing investigation and we’ll continue working with local law enforcement.” “We work daily to maintain a safe and secure environment for everyone at our stores,” the company said in a statement.  The store was placed on lockdown at the time of the shooting but had reopened just after 3 p.m. Footage on social media showed people inside the Walmart gathered in a back room before crowds were released.  “A lot of my coworkers are shaken up,” said employee David Pineda, who showed up for work after the incident happened.  A vehicle was seen outside the building with damage to the car and shattered windows.  Police said an investigation remained ongoing.

See Offers Business Posted March 13 Updated March 13 increase font size Wal-Mart employees receive bonus checks The mega retailer gives more than 4,000 Maine employees checks averaging $183, a share of the company's strong fourth-quarter earnings. Staff report Share Comment Read Article Wal-Mart distributed bonuses to more than 4,000 Maine employees last week, payments that reflect strong fourth-quarter earnings for the mega retailer. The average Maine bonus amounted to $183.13, according to a news release from Wal-Mart. Bonuses were distributed to more than 850,000 Wal-Mart employees in the U.S. after the close of the fourth quarter, when the company reported revenues north of $130 billion and strong comparable sales. More than $157 million was awarded in the quarterly bonus, including $800,000 for Maine, destined for 4,414 employees. Wal-Mart is Maine’s third-largest private employer with more than 7,000 employees. The quarterly bonuses were awarded to employees who had been with the company for at least six months and, in the case of entry-level workers, completed the Pathways training program. In 2015, Wal-Mart announced it would increase minimum pay for its employees and expand training opportunities. Training programs for entry-level workers, frontline supervisors, department managers and assistant managers were all launched in 2016. In Maine, the retailer promoted 959 employees to jobs with higher pay and more responsibility, and 666 employees were converted from part time to full time, according to the company. Information supplied by Dunn & Bradstreet said Wal-Mart operates 22 stores in Maine and is expected to spend $47.6 million with local suppliers, supporting 22,872 indirect jobs this year. It also paid more than $31.9 million in Maine taxes and collected more than $60.1 million in sales taxes in 2016. Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

Courtesy of the village of Carpentersville   Lauren Rohr Follow @LaurenRohr     O'Reilly Auto Parts plans to open a store in Carpentersville, making it the third automotive parts and supplies retailer in a half-mile radius. The 7,225-square-foot building will be constructed at 375 Lake Marian Road on an outlot of the Wal-Mart Supercenter. The Missouri-based O'Reilly company has a contract to purchase the vacant property from Wal-Mart, according to village documents. The village board's unanimous approval last week of the store's development plans grants the company permission to begin construction, Community Development Director Marc Huber said. Trustee Don Burroway said he was concerned about the store's probable competition with two similar retailers nearby: Advance Auto Parts at 340 Lake Marian Road and AutoZone at 1002 S. Kennedy Drive. But while polling other communities, Huber said, the village found it's fairly common for multiple businesses in the same category to open near one another. Architect David Mangurten of KMA & Associates, who is working with O'Reilly, said company representatives have also vetted the area to make sure it's a good fit. That process, he said, includes researching surrounding businesses and the village's demographics. "There's something special about Carpentersville that apparently these people feel it can support their store," he said. In Trustee Pat Schultz's eyes, it's not up to the village to determine which businesses can acquire or build on private land, as long as the proposal meets all zoning requirements, as is the case for the O'Reilly store. "Wal-Mart owned that property. They decide who was going to come, not the village," she said. "They could've brought in anybody that they wanted to bring in, so that was their choice." Choosing an auto parts retailer to take over one of its outlots was likely an intentional business decision for Wal-Mart, as its Carpentersville store does not have an auto center, Village President Ed Ritter said. "This will be a (sales) tax-producing building, at least, as opposed to a nontax-producing building," he said. "That's the best choice for us."

Walmart associates can earn quarterly bonuses based on the performance of their store. Metro East workers will share more than $5.8 million in bonus compensation in Illinois. The bonuses come on the heels of Walmart U.S. recording its strongest comp sales performance of the year in the fourth quarter at 1.8 percent. Customer service and inventory have also improved. For the full fiscal year, U.S. associates shared more than $700 million in bonuses. “We are so grateful for the amazing work our associates are doing every day to help their respective stores meet their performance and customer service goals,” said Becky Dedman, Walmart regional general manager in the Metro East. “When our associates succeed, the company succeeds, and the $157 million in cash bonuses we are providing nationwide represent our way of saying thank you to our incredible associates for a job well-done.” Doug McMillion, Walmart President and CEO, shared his own “thank you” message to associates Monday morning on Facebook.

Quotes in the article Target Corp TGT ▲ 54.59 +0.02 +0.04% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 70.44 -0.14 -0.20% Costco Wholesale Corp COST ▲ 167.06 +0.52 +0.31% AdChoices As companies like Target (TGT) and Wal-Mart (WMT) go head to head on value, a House bill proposing a tax on imported goods threatens to undermine any progress they make. While the specifics around potential legislation remain fuzzy — as well as its odds of passing — the current version being pushed by the GOP calls for a 20 percent tax on products coming into the U.S. Given that the majority of apparel, footwear and consumer electronics sold in the U.S. are manufactured abroad, retailers have frequently, and vociferously, asserted that such a tax would wipe out their profits and force them to charge more. That rhetoric stands directly at odds with their promise to offer low prices every day, underscoring just how tightly they're being squeezed as they compete for penny-pinching shoppers' dollars. "In the long-run, it's not sustainable to absorb these costs," Johan Gott, a principal at strategy and management consultant A.T. Kearney, told CNBC. "Retailers don't have very large margins to play with." Yet the very real possibility of being forced into price increases hasn't stopped retailers from promising more consistent deals. At its recent investor day in New York City, Target said it would dial back its use of one-off coupons in favor ofeverydaylow prices — a phrase that's become synonymous with Wal-Mart's strategy. Like Target, the world's largest retailer over the past year has been looking at its cost structure to systematically lower prices. And on a call with investors earlier this month, a Costco (COST) executive said the club retailer, too, is moving toward an everyday low pricing model on more of its items. Yet the rhetoric coming from these companies is a tale of two tapes. While on one hand, they're promising to lead on price, they're also warning that a border tax would cause consumers to pay more. "We've spent our whole lives driving down prices, and recognizing also that [for] so many items... they don't exist [in the U.S.]," Costco CFO Richard Galanti told analysts on the company's earnings call. "Prices will ultimately have to rise." Target CEO Brian Cornell has been particularly vocal on the topic, having met with President Donald Trump to express his concerns about consumers paying the ultimate price of a border tax. "We had a really productive conversation," Cornell told reporters. Analysts note that if a border tax were to go through, every retailer would be forced to deal with the repercussions, essentially putting them on even playing field. As a result, the price wars would likely continue — just off a higher base. Yet some would be at a greater disadvantage than others. Wal-Mart, for instance, generates more than half its revenue from groceries, which would be less vulnerable under the tax. Meanwhile, Costco is somewhat cushioned by its annual membership fee, which accounts for three-fourths of its operating income. Those two factors would make a border tax less burdensome than on a company like Target, analysts have said. Many large retailers are already looking at their supply chains and sourcing strategies to figure out where they could save on the cost of goods. Possible options include turning to a country less impacted by the evolving trade rules or sourcing some products in the U.S. However, there are limited opportunities for Made in the USA merchandise, as the country's infrastructure no longer supports large-scale manufacturing. That leaves retailers with little wiggle room. "If they try to increase ticket prices what they're going to see is [fewer] people buying," Murali Gokki, a managing director in AlixPartners' retail practice, told CNBC. "Consumers have little appetite to pay a higher price." Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem. Please try again.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 March 2017 by Military News Project Runway Contestant Lands First Major Distribution Deal With Walmart Appearing on Project Runway in fall of 2016, the 27-year-old entrepreneur has now successfully closed his first major retail deal, landing a contract with the leading international giant Walmart. Los Angeles, USA, March 13, 2017 (Newswire.com) – Founded in 1962 by Sam Walton, Walmart has now grown to become the world’s largest company by revenue, and employs 2.2 million people around the world according to Forbes Magazine. With 12,000 stores spread out across the world, Walmart is reported to carry almost 150,000 different brands. Although the number of brands carried might be high, the chances of landing a deal with the retail giant are extremely low. Geomarketing.com reports that approximately 96% of brands that approach the international giant will be turned away. Now 27-year-old Ryan Zamo has officially become part of the 4% of accepted brands, taking his handmade organic skincare brand ‘Z Skin’ into Walmart stores. After launching his brand is late 2014, the young entrepreneur appeared on the Lifetime show ‘Project Runway; Fashion Startup’ in November, pitching his company to the panel of investors, Zamo said, “Though I did not get a deal, the main reason I went onto the show was to move my products into retail stores. I’m actually glad I didn’t get a deal though, I was able to successfully do everything I wanted on my own.” With the international exposure from the show, which is currently airing on Bravo TV in Canada, Zamo was able to leverage his appearance to land a deal with the global giant, he said, “I tried connecting with them a few times before being on the show but never even got a response back. After I was on the series, I was able to approach them with the number of viewers, explaining that now over 1.5 million people would potentially recognize the brand.” When asked why he chose Walmart over other major retail chains, Zamo explained, “Z Skin has become so successful through our website ZskinCosmetics.Com because we are an affordable organic skincare brand. I wanted to bring my products to the everyday consumer at a price they can afford, and if I had gone with Macy’s for example, my customers most likely wouldn’t be able to afford it anymore. Walmart on the other hand is known for bringing great products at the lowest price possible, which is exactly what I wanted.” Though he did not move all of his products into the store, Zamo said he proposed his top selling products to be sold. Currently, the Z Skin products that can be found within Walmart are; The Complete Age Defying System, Complete Acne System, Face Lift Lotion, Face Lift Wash, Daytime Eye, Nighttime Eye, Acne Day Lotion, Acne Night Lotion and Z Skin Coffee Face Scrub.

Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Mar 13, 2017 at 9:35AM Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an unfamiliar position these days. The world's largest retailer, which put hundreds of mom-and-pop stores out of business with its superstores that offer rock-bottom prices, is now in a fight for its own relevance, playing catch-up to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).  Image source: Getty Images. After years of ignoring the opportunity in e-commerce, Wal-Mart finds itself playing second fiddle to Amazon, which now has a market cap nearly twice that of Wal-Mart's. In the last year, Wally World has taken steps to accelerate its e-commerce business by buying Jet.com, along with two smaller businesses, and rapidly expanding its online grocery pickup program. In many ways, Wal-Mart's struggles to overcome Amazon's advantages is similar to a battle between the leader and challenger in another industry -- Uber and Lyft. The rat race in ridehailing Uber was the first-mover in the app-based ridehailing industry, and is by far the leader in an increasingly fragmented space. It's valued at a whopping $68 billion, more than carmakers such as General Motors, Ford, and Tesla Motors, showing that investors have placed a premium on transportation rather than the car itself. Today, Uber is active in 81 countries and 581 cities around the world, including 209 in the U.S. Ridehailing seems like the type of industry that would lend itself to monopoly. Once a company like Uber builds up an army of drivers and gets thousands of passengers to download its app, it would seem to have the network effects and barriers to entry to block competition. But smaller ridehailing apps have crept into the mix. Lyft, the No. 2 ride-hailing company, has become Uber's principal challenger largely by positing itself as its cultural antithesis. Uber's brand is generally seen as bloodless and corporate, its logo draped in black. Lyft has positioned itself as the friendly ridehailing service, using hot pink as its principal color. For a while, Lyft drivers signified themselves by having hot pink mustaches over their cars' grills. Lyft, unlike Uber, allows passengers to tip, and encourages drivers to be friendly and make conversation with their fares. It also seems to treat its drivers better, and has not been subject to the protests and disputes that have become commonplace with Uber.   Lyft aims for an overall different experience than Uber. That may have seemed like a minor detail, but in recent weeks a series of unforced errors have dramatically damaged Uber's already questionable reputation. First, a tweet accusing Uber of trying to break a temporary strike by New York cabbies at JFK airport went viral, prompting the hashtag #DeleteUber to start trending as thousands of users deleted their accounts and sent angry letters to the company. Later, a blog post vilified Uber for allowing rampant sexual harassment and a culture that demeaned women, and a video of CEO Travis Kalanick excoriating a driver was picked up by several media sources. Reports also emerged about software Uber created to undermine local regulations, and Kalanick is now reportedly seeking leadership counseling and searching for a COO. The narrative of Uber is a bad corporate citizen is now well established and has become a storyline in the media that will pop up every time there is a similar incident. Lyft wisely took advantage of Uber's mistakes. During the chaotic weekend of airport protests, Lyft responded to the Uber boycott by pledging to donate $1 million to the ACLU. In the wake of the Uber backlash, Lyft downloads surged into the top ten in the App Store with nearly 200,000 in one day -- a new company record. It was the first time Lyft's downloads topped Uber's, nothing short of a coup for a company valued at $5.5 billion, just a fraction of Uber's worth. As Uber retrenches and licks its wounds, Lyft is now reportedly seeking another $500 million in funding. What Wal-Mart can learn Wal-Mart, with much greater profits than Amazon and a wealth of resources, is in a stronger position than Lyft, but the story above highlights one key way Wal-Mart can challenge Amazon as it attempts to build out its marketplace. Amazon isn't exactly vulnerable in the way that Uber is. The company has a stellar reputation with customers, but there are some who view it as overly cutthroat, and it has been known to step on its merchants' toes. Amazon's merchants have complained in the past about the company taking their best-selling products, and selling them itself, directly competing with the merchants and often undercutting them on price. For that reason, many merchants prefer selling on eBay, says Kevin North, CEO of Terapeak, an e-commerce analytics firm. eBay acts only as a marketplace and does not sell goods directly. Those merchants view Amazon "very, very cautiously," he said. He sees an opportunity for Wal-Mart, saying it could win over merchants by being friendlier than Amazon and not competing with them. North added that merchants are still working for clarity from Wal-Mart on what kind of partner it would be.  Wal-Mart has sped up its efforts to recruit vendors, but it's still going too slow. At the time of the acquisition of Jet.com, Wal-Mart had just 600 sellers, compared to Jet's 2,400 after just a year in business. Wal-Mart had been struggling with onboarding vendors previously, but acquiring Jet changes that. North called the Jet acquisition a "game-changer" for Wal-Mart in part because it brings on e-commerce mastermind Marc Lore, who founded Jet as well as Quidsi, which he sold to Amazon -- but also because it will help Wal-Mart ramp up its marketplace. The company has already upped the stakes by offering free two-day delivery on orders of $35 or more. Now it needs to aggressively pursue vendors, and eliminate the popular notion that Amazon is the only game in town when it comes to online shopping. Like Uber drivers, Amazon merchants are wary of the company's monopolistic ambitions, and are eager to spread their wares over multiple sites. As Lyft has found, there are benefits to being No. 2.   Jeremy Bowman has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Amazon and eBay.

Retailers' heated price wars may get doused with a bucket of cold water. As companies like Target and Wal-Mart go head-to-head on value, a House bill proposing a tax on imported goods threatens to undermine any progress they make. While the specifics around potential legislation remain fuzzy — as well as its odds of passing — the current version being pushed by the GOP calls for a 20 percent tax on products coming into the U.S. Given that the majority of apparel, footwear and consumer electronics sold in the U.S. are manufactured abroad, retailers have frequently, and vociferously, asserted that such a tax would wipe out their profits and force them to charge more. That rhetoric stands directly at odds with their promise to offer low prices every day, underscoring just how tightly they're being squeezed as they compete for penny-pinching shoppers' dollars. "In the long-run, it's not sustainable to absorb these costs," Johan Gott, a principal at strategy and management consultant A.T. Kearney, told CNBC. "Retailers don't have very large margins to play with." Yet the very real possibility of being forced into price increases hasn't stopped retailers from promising more consistent deals. At its recent investor day in New York City, Target said it would dial back its use of one-off coupons in favor ofeverydaylow prices — a phrase that's become synonymous with Wal-Mart's strategy. Like Target, the world's largest retailer over the past year has been looking at its cost structure to systematically lower prices. And on a call with investors earlier this month, a Costco executive said the club retailer, too, is moving toward an everyday low pricing model on more of its items. show chapters JCPenney CEO: Border tax would make short-term profits ‘virtually impossible’    Friday, 10 Mar 2017 | 9:12 AM ET | 01:26 Yet the rhetoric coming from these companies is a tale of two tapes. While on one hand, they're promising to lead on price, they're also warning that a border tax would cause consumers to pay more. "We've spent our whole lives driving down prices, and recognizing also that [for] so many items... they don't exist [in the U.S.]," Costco CFO Richard Galanti told analysts on the company's earnings call. "Prices will ultimately have to rise." Target CEO Brian Cornell has been particularly vocal on the topic, having met with President Donald Trump to express his concerns about consumers paying the ultimate price of a border tax. "We had a really productive conversation," Cornell told reporters. Analysts note that if a border tax were to go through, every retailer would be forced to deal with the repercussions, essentially putting them on even playing field. As a result, the price wars would likely continue — just off a higher base. Yet some would be at a greater disadvantage than others. Wal-Mart, for instance, generates more than half its revenue from groceries, which would be less vulnerable under the tax. Meanwhile, Costco is somewhat cushioned by its annual membership fee, which accounts for three-fourths of its operating income. Those two factors would make a border tax less burdensome than on a company like Target, analysts have said. Many large retailers are already looking at their supply chains and sourcing strategies to figure out where they could save on the cost of goods. Possible options include turning to a country less impacted by the evolving trade rules or sourcing some products in the U.S. However, there are limited opportunities for Made in the USA merchandise, as the country's infrastructure no longer supports large-scale manufacturing. That leaves retailers with little wiggle room. "If they try to increase ticket prices what they're going to see is [fewer] people buying," Murali Gokki, a managing director in AlixPartners' retail practice, told CNBC. "Consumers have little appetite to pay a higher price."

Wal-Mart de Mexico, Mexico's biggest retailer, plans to increase spending by nearly 19 percent in 2017, upgrading and adding new stores and investing in e-commerce, a top executive said on Tuesday. Walmex, as the company is known, will spend 17 billion pesos ($864.80 million) in 2017, above the 14.3 billion pesos they spent last year, Chief Financial Officer Pedro Farah told investors during a company presentation. Walmex continues to see opportunities to add stores and has become more efficient with its construction projects, according to Gaston Wainstein, Walmex head of real estate. However, Central America head Carlos Arroyo said the region is not growing as quickly as the company would like, which is limiting the number of stores it is prepared to build there. Walmex also said it is paying 35 percent more in bonuses to its low-level employees this year than it did a year ago. It also plans to open a second meat-cutting plant in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey, executives said on Tuesday. Executives from the retailer, controlled by Wal-Mart Stores Inc, repeatedly emphasized investments in e-commerce. "We don't think e-commerce is a loss leader," said Philip Behn, Walmex's head of eCommerce, calling it a driver of growth, profit and capital efficiency.

(AP) — A federal judge has vacated a nearly $1 million trademark infringement award made to the owners of the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally brand. Sturgis Motorcycle Rally Inc., which owns the Sturgis logo, sued Walmart and a Rapid City retailer for allegedly improperly using the Sturgis trademark on merchandise. A jury awarded $912,500 to SMRI following a civil trial in October 2015, the Rapid City Journal reported (http://bit.ly/2mnnZYY ). Federal Judge Jeffrey Viken upheld SMRI's trademark rights, but set aside the jury award against the defendants. In the trial, the two companies said that the Sturgis Chamber of Commerce lied when it convinced the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to grant the "Sturgis" trademark. The argument was that because Sturgis is a geographical name, it could not be trademarked. The jury still disagreed, deciding in favor of SMRI. Minneapolis attorney Aaron Davis represented Rushmore Photos & Gifts in Rapid City and Walmart. "Judge Viken upheld SMRI's trademark rights per se, but the damages finding against the defendants has been vacated, dismissed basically," Davis said. "There is no money judgment that survives this court order." He said the ruling doesn't mean the case is over, pending an appeal by the plaintiffs. But he said the judge's decision is "a huge burden off of our clients." Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

"We weren't overjoyed with the judge's ruling deferring to the jury that SMRI had the (trademark) rights and that may be a point of appeal in the future," Davis said. "We feel strongly that they don't have any rights to this trademark at all." ___ Information from: Rapid City Journal, http://www.rapidcityjournal.com Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

McMillon was one of the speakers at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Investor Conference in New York City. McMillon said he and Wal-Mart CFO Brett Biggs joked on the flight that they might have to converse among themselves given the blustery winter storm Stella which had blanketed the city in snow this morning. “It’s really nice that you made it; appreciate that,” McMillon said as he took the stage. McMillon outlined a few key objectives that has Wal-Mart’s complete focus, which aside from saving people money and time involves the company’s digital transformation. That conversion is not just on the outside customer-facing areas like mobile pay or the skip-the-line feature added to the mobile application. McMillon said it’s equally important to change on the inside. “We were born with a low cost mindset,” McMillon said. “But, as time goes on and the company gets bigger and older, you inherit bureaucracy, layers and expense and in some cases we don’t need. We’ve been trying to chip away at that, but we’ve got more of a transformation to go through. We’ll keep working on the conventional ways to reduce cost. But we’re really excited about changing how we work inside the company to be digital in size, not just with the things that customers need, but how we actually do work.” McMillon said the retailer is not only using digital capabilities to enhance customer shopping experiences. It’s also figuring out how the technologies may allow employees to work more efficiently. For instance, he said in the past he might have asked a store manager to run a report for him, but now the data is readily available automatically on a mobile application. He said store managers can now run stores largely through the use of mobile applications, reducing time and overhead costs. “We must do that in the home office, which will increase our speed,” McMillon said. In the past year, McMillon said his leadership team has been reading and talking about design thinking and talking with others about what it means to be a digital enterprise. He said they’ve also brought in guest speakers from digitally native companies to talk about it. McMillon has been around Wal-Mart a long time, and he confessed one of his biggest challenges is not flooding the engine with too many ideas. “We have to be able to execute,” he added. “But it’s a really exciting time to be in our business.” Analysts asked McMillon about discount competitors Lidl and Aldi. He said Wal-Mart doesn’t underestimate those companies as competitors, but the retailer will look to win where it can, and that’s primarily on assortment and offering multiple channel options. When asked if the retailer would consider creating alternative ancillary profit streams the way Amazon does with its advertising and cloud services, McMillon admitted the company could and should do more of that. He said Wal-Mart’s board of directors and leadership team regularly discuss areas they want and need to be more involved. He said that includes different categories, geographies and formats. He said the company must be thoughtful about what areas to expand reach and not get too far from “the core DNA.” “But there are things that are closer to the core of what we do,” McMillon concluded. “Financial services would be one, health and wellness is an area where we think we have an opportunity that we probably need to be more aggressive. So, it could be in the future that you see us be more deliberate about creating additional profit pools. That’s certainly on the agenda and we’re thinking about lots of things, and many of which you could probably guess. But we will be really thoughtful and deliberate about those kinds of choices including managing our existing portfolio.” Wal-Mart Stores shares (NYSE: WMT) closed Tuesday at $70.72, up 1.10% on the day. Over the past 52-week period shares traded from a high $75.19 to a low $62.72.

On March 4, a caller with a restricted number made two phone calls "claiming to be bringing a bomb to the Jasper Walmart," the release said. Two days later, a bomb threat was made to Whataburger on South Wheeler Street, Jasper PD said. They were able to obtain a cell phone number from that call, and police were able to identify the suspects in both calls. "It was learned that the suspects were juveniles playing phone pranks," the release said. A 15-year-old will be charged with a class A misdemeanor, making a terroristic threat, for the Walmart call, Jasper PD said. Whataburger did not pursue charges. The teen has not yet been arrested, the release said. "Investigators are in the process of obtaining a warrant."

You took the time to turn my purse into the customer service department, and Walmart was able to contact me and return my purse. The outstanding thing about this was that nothing was missing. I pray that the Lord will richly bless you for doing this and for your honesty. A heartfelt thank you to the staff at Walmart who were so kind to me when I came in so upset about my purse. We hear so many bad things that happen, I just wanted to share some good news. I consider this a miracle from the Lord. Thank you so much Carol Horton Mooreville Click here to leave a comment!

It must benefit the overall mission and not just one or two supervisors. I want all of you to give and take from each and come out with a strong policy that benefits our mission. Right now we pay our people both in congress and the senate to support our State and the USA. What I see is each party stick together and it’s all yes or all no. That hurts our state and country because we just go to our corners and nothing passes that benefits our state or country. We could save a lot of money by just keeping our congressional people home and let them mailing it in. Back around the sixty both party work together for the good of all, but no more. Because their voting record is either all no or all or all yes in lock step as if there was no other way. I’m sure one day it will change when we the people make it clear they work for us and all of the People of the United States. Ken Taylor TWBDB Hear, hear !

Should You? A few famous investors hit the sell button on these five stocks in the fourth quarter. Should individual investors follow their lead? Brian Feroldi, Dan Caplinger, Rich Duprey, Jason Hall, and Jordan Wathen (TMFTypeoh) Mar 14, 2017 at 12:02PM Billionaire investors such as Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn, and George Soros have minted themselves a fortune by staying one step ahead of the markets. That's why we Fools like to dig through SEC filings each quarter to see what these brilliant investors have been buying or selling recently.  After digging through those filings, our team of Fool contributors noticed that these investors have been selling off their positions in Barrick Gold (NYSE:ABX), Transocean (NYSE:RIG), Seadrill Ltd. (NYSE:SDRL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). Is it a good idea to follow suit? Image source: Getty Images. Looking for riches under the sea Dan Caplinger (Transocean): The offshore-drilling industry has been a tough place to make money lately, and many investors have started to lose faith in Transocean and its peers. Late last year, well-known activist investor and billionaire Carl Icahn slashed his position in Transocean, citing the need to take tax losses but also having suffered a dramatic decline in the value of the stock since his initial investment. Transocean and offshore drillers in general have been among the hardest hit in the industry, largely because the projects that rely on the company's drilling rigs tend to be more expensive than land-based exploration activity. When oil prices were above $100 per barrel, the higher potential reward made offshore drilling worth the effort, and that helped push demand for drilling equipment much higher. Yet when the energy market went into the tank, Transocean found itself with clients who no longer wanted to move full steam ahead on expensive offshore projects. In the aftermath, gluts of equipment have contributed to lower contract rates. Currently, Transocean is at a turning point. Current oil prices have rebounded somewhat, but they still aren't high enough to justify a return to full capacity. If oil rises further, then Transocean is in a position to recover its losses. But if oil sags, it could spell a long-term problem for Transocean and its growth prospects.  Does gold still glitter? Rich Duprey (Barrick Gold): Considering his track record lately, investors might not want to follow the moves billionaire investor George Soros is making these days, but he's not a billionaire for nothing. Soros Fund Management reportedly lost $1 billion betting against a market rally following Donald Trump's election and in the fourth quarter dumped all of its holdings in Barrick Gold, only to see shares of the miner surge this year. While it had jumped as much as 50% between its mid-December lows and the peak it hit mid-February, it's eased back a bit since, and investors should consider which way it will go from here. After all, Soros' biggest sin may have been simply selling too early -- but if we look at Barrick Gold's bigger picture, I'd say no, don't follow Soros' lead here. In its fourth-quarter earnings report last month, the gold miner reduced its all-in sustaining costs (AISC) to just $732 per ounce, or 40% below gold's current price. It shows that the cost-cutting initiatives Barrick has implemented are bearing fruit, and the gains are expected to accelerate this year, with AISC falling even further. The gold miner has paid off a good chunk of its long-term debt, and though it still carries some $8 billion worth on its balance sheet, there isn't much coming due anytime soon. Moreover, Barrick owns five core mines that should produce 70% of its volumes this year, with ore grades that are more than double that of the miner's peer group. It also expects to produce some 5.9 million ounces this year, or 5% more than in 2016. There's good reason to keep betting on gold generally and Barrick Gold in particular, and following George Soros in dumping your shares might just tarnish your portfolio. Giving the thumbs-down to this social network Brian Feroldi (Facebook): With a net worth of roughly $13 billion, Steven Cohen is one of the most successful hedge fund managers in the world. That's why it caught my attention when I found out that Point72 Asset Management -- one of Cohen's hedge funds -- dumped 96% of his position in Facebook in the fourth quarter.  If you look at the numbers, you might be scratching your head as to why Cohen would want to give up on Facebook right now. Last quarter, Facebook's revenue surged 51% while expenses grew by only 29%. The difference caused margins to balloon and allowed EPS to more than double. Those are impressive figures for any company, let alone a megacap like Facebook. Beyond the financials, Facebook's community also continues to thrive. The company welcomes 1.86 billion unique visitors a month, up 17% from the year-ago period. What's even more amazing is that 1.23 billion users interact with the site every day. That's telling about how much value users get from the site.  Given those terrific results, my hunch is that Cohen is worried that Facebook's revenue is going to significantly decelerate in the years ahead. That's a legitimate concern now that the company's ad load is leveling off. Furthermore, expenses are expected to continue to rise significantly as the company adds engineering talent. That could lead to a meaningful slowdown in profits. With shares trading near an all-time high, perhaps he wanted to cash in his chips while he could.  Regardless of Cohen's move, I for one couldn't be more excited about Facebook's long-term potential. That's why I have no intentions to part ways with my shares anytime soon. Big investors selling this troubled offshore driller (and you probably should, too)  Jason Hall (Seadrill Ltd.): After the company disclosed in its most recent quarterly earnings filing that Chapter 11 bankruptcy is on the table, investors of every ilk -- not just billionaires -- have been selling off shares of Seadrill. And for good reason, since the company is facing more than $1 billion in debt it must pay off between now and June, with hundreds of millions of it maturing at the end of April.  As things stand today, the writing's on the wall that the company won't pay off that first debt maturity, which would put it in default on essentially all of its long-term debt soon after.  Should you follow the rest of Seadrill's investors to the exits? Probably, yes, if you have capital at risk that you really can't afford to lose. The offshore-drilling industry remains an awful business right now. Offshore oil and gas producers are on track to spend less capital this year than anytime in the past decade-plus.  There's still a chance that Seadrill can turn things around and come to terms with its debt holders, in which case today's price will end up being a bargain. If you're willing to take on that risk -- and acknowledge you could end up with nothing -- there's a case for staying invested. Just don't be shocked if it doesn't work out.  Another sign of retail doom Jordan Wathen (Wal-Mart): Warren Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, nearly blew out of its billion-dollar position in Wal-Mart in the most recent quarter. And while Wal-Mart may have been a small part of Berkshire's portfolio, few likely know more about Wal-Mart than Warren Buffett does. In May 2003, Berkshire Hathaway acquired a little-known Wal-Mart subsidiary known as McLane Company, a distributor of groceries and foods to stores all around the country. Shortly after that acquisition, in 2005, Berkshire purchased shares of Wal-Mart, perhaps having learned to appreciate the retailer's operations after observing it through McLane Company. More than a decade after Berkshire's investment, Buffett apparently wants out. Wal-Mart finds itself situated between fierce competition in grocery and general merchandise. In grocery, competitors such as Aldi, which has quietly opened more than 1,600 stores in the U.S., many of which are located in proximity to Wal-Mart stores, competes directly on price for core grocery items including milk and produce. In general merchandise, online stores such as Amazon.com have the lead in distribution and can deliver products directly to their customers' doors, often at a better price. Buffett has shared his praise for Amazon's CEO, Jeff Bezos, telling CNBC last May, "We haven't seen many businessmen like him." Keep in mind that Berkshire is awash in cash and prefers to leave gains unharvested rather than collect its winnings and pay taxes. That Berkshire is reassessing its stake in Wal-Mart should give shareholders pause about the company, and retail in general. Brian Feroldi owns shares of Amazon and Facebook.

Keeping up with employment norms, Asda, the Walmart-owned British retailer, has offered a ‘flexible’ deal to its staff – BBC reports. The proposed contract changes, which Asda claim staff will not be forced to sign, will see wages rise to £8.50 an hour in exchange for Bank Holiday work requirements and unpaid breaks. This means that staff must work on bank holidays if told to, and if they want time off it must come out of their 28-day annual leave. Changes will also affect night shift staff who are currently paid an extra £2.04 an hour between 10pm and 6am. The new agreement will see Asda shorten what it recognises as unsociable hours to between midnight and 5am. However, the premium rate will rise to an additional £2.54 an hour. Asda claims 95% of its staff will be better off under the new deal. Asda said it was "maintaining its commitment not to use zero hours contracts and colleagues will be guaranteed minimum hours". They continued: "The new contract will require colleagues to be flexible [and] fair . . . reasonable notice will be given for any changes to rotas and consideration will be given to those with care requirements outside of work." Speaking to the BBC, Katherine Chapman, Director of the Living Wage Foundation, welcomed the changes at Britain’s third-largest supermarket chain: “This is a welcome pay rise for Asda's staff, however, large national retailers like Ikea, Lush and Majestic Wine are already paying all their staff - including third party contractors - the real Living Wage or above at £8.45 in the UK and £9.75 in London for every hour worked.” Roadmap to Change Management Crown Workforce Management Systems has produced a free downloadable white paper on key milestones to... Read more Amanda Powell Smith, CEO at Forster Communications, believes that the flexible working hours will benefit both businesses and the staff they employ. She said: “Flexible working needs to be recognised as a massive opportunity for both employer and employee [especially] with workers who stay into their 60s and 70s as the norm, challenging current preconceptions and forcing new ways of working.” Aldi is currently the UK’s highest-paying supermarket with staff, outside of London, earning £8.53 an hour. Lidl plan to offer an £8.45 per hour wage, outside of London, from March. Tesco have pledged to pay shop staff at least £7.62 an hour from this summer. An anonymous Glasdoor review, from a shop assistant at an Asda store in Belfast, said that working at Asda has lots of pros, including: “Flexible working hours; plenty of overtime if wanted; no huge pressure to take extra hours if doesn't suit; competitive pay for young people; straightforward work; friendly managers (mostly); ten per cent staff discount after three months.” Michael Hibbs, employment law partner at Shakespeare Martineau, offered his opinions on Asda’s introduction of a new flexible contract. He said: “This could be the new model for the sector. Adopting a flexible approach to contracts, such as zero-hour contract, has previously come with the stigma of being unfair on the employee. It is likely that this type of flexible contract will not suit everyone; however, the voluntary nature of the arrangement at this stage will give employees the option. However, whether Asda will put some gentle pressure on employees is of course not clear at this stage.

The requirement of flexibility is such that if the manager asks you to be in, it is expected for you to be able to change plans to accommodate them. In regards to the 'voluntary' nature of the change, in at least one store huge pressure is being placed on staff to switch over with no ability to change their minds once they agree to it.

(AP) — A federal judge has vacated a nearly $1 million trademark infringement award made to the owners of the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally brand. Sturgis Motorcycle Rally Inc., which owns the Sturgis logo, sued Walmart and a Rapid City retailer for allegedly improperly using the Sturgis trademark on merchandise. A jury awarded $912,500 to SMRI following a civil trial in October 2015, the Rapid City Journal reported (http://bit.ly/2mnnZYY ). Federal Judge Jeffrey Viken upheld SMRI's trademark rights, but set aside the jury award against the defendants. In the trial, the two companies said that the Sturgis Chamber of Commerce lied when it convinced the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to grant the "Sturgis" trademark. The argument was that because Sturgis is a geographical name, it could not be trademarked. The jury still disagreed, deciding in favor of SMRI. Minneapolis attorney Aaron Davis represented Rushmore Photos & Gifts in Rapid City and Walmart. "Judge Viken upheld SMRI's trademark rights per se, but the damages finding against the defendants has been vacated, dismissed basically," Davis said. "There is no money judgment that survives this court order." He said the ruling doesn't mean the case is over, pending an appeal by the plaintiffs. But he said the judge's decision is "a huge burden off of our clients." "We weren't overjoyed with the judge's ruling deferring to the jury that SMRI had the (trademark) rights and that may be a point of appeal in the future," Davis said. "We feel strongly that they don't have any rights to this trademark at all." ___ Information from: Rapid City Journal, http://www.rapidcityjournal.com Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

Angela D. Benton, 36, no address listed, was arrested at about 10 after the incident at the Walmart at 3111 Browns Mill Road. Police said several bondsmen were trying to take Benton into custody on outstanding warrants. Police said Benton used her vehicle to intentionally ram two vehicles as she tried to escape. Damage costs estimates for each vehicle set charges at a felony level, and one vehicle was occupied by a bondsman when it was rammed. That bondsman, along with two others alongside Benton’s vehicle, were placed in immediate danger by the defendant’s actions, police said. Benton was charged with three counts of reckless endangerment by motor vehicle, leaving the scene of an accident with damage, leaving the scene of an accident involving an unattended vehicle, two counts of felony vandalism and a second offense of driving on a revoked license. She was held in the Washington County Detention Center on $32,000 bond awaiting a Sessions Court appearance set for Monday.

Watch out! By Charles Payne, Editor, Smart Investing  |  Mar 13, 2017, 12:05 pm EDT     View All   Popular Posts: Charles Payne on Snap Inc: Be Prepared to Lose Recent Posts: Charles Payne on Snap Inc: Be Prepared to Lose Carter’s, Inc. (CRI) Stock Shows Promise in Retail Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT) Criticizes Border Tax, And Rightfully So View All Posts There has been a lot of buzz around Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP), more commonly known as Snapchat, since SNAP stock went public last Thursday and traded more than its 200,000 share float in just its first day. Source: Shutterstock The offering was priced at $17, but SNAP stock opened at $24 and closed at $24.48. On Friday it continued higher, topping out at $29.44 before turning back last week to hit a low of $20.64 on Tuesday. A lot of folks who bought the first two days are looking at losses, and shareholders who got in at the IPO price are hopeful that amazing debut doesn’t vanish into thin air. It’s too early to see where the company and stock might be a year from now, but there are cautionary tales from past hot tech IPOs worth visiting. Where SNAP Stock May Be Headed Theglobe.com, inc. (OTCMKTS:TGLO) saw a couple of college undergrads take the concept of chat rooms public, and that set the world on fire. On Nov. 13, 1998, The Globe’s initial price was offered at $9. Once it began trading it rallied all the way to $97 before settling at $63 for a record one-day gain of 606%. In many ways, this took the tech IPO market into overdrive and got a number of Americans thinking they would “play” the market and retire at 40. One of the founders was known for hitting the town in leather pants with his model girlfriend. It’s not known what happened to the pants or the girl, as the stock eventually worked its way to penny stock territory. If the Globe took the tech bubble into overdrive, it was World Online that erected its brick wall. The Dutch tech company was billed as the America Online for Europe and Africa. It was successful with growing subscribers, but there was the issue of profits. However, that’s not where the deathblow came from. There was one hell of a party that day on March 17, 2000, as the stock was oversubscribed 21 times. When trading began, the shares skyrocketed. By the closing bell, they were unchanged at 43 euros, but still sported a 12 billion euro valuation. In the midst of the party, someone asked founder Nina Brink what she thought of the action and what she was going to do with her newfound wealth. That’s when she admitted to having already sold her entire 10% stake in a private transaction for only 6 euros per share. The stock went into freefall. A week later, the S&P 500 hit an all-time high and began to implode. I’d say it was a sobering wake-up call — everyone had been suckered and the game was over. I’m not saying SNAP is either theglobe.com or World Online, but now all the unicorns are going to come public, and some will be dogs looking for suckers to finish the “Greater Fool Theory,” so be careful.

Debra Clayton The autopsy released on Friday showed that Orlando Police Lt. Debra Clayton was shot four times, including in the neck and stomach. The autopsy released on Friday showed that Orlando Police Lt. Debra Clayton was shot four times, including in the neck and stomach. David HarrisContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton was shot four times, including in the neck and stomach, her autopsy released Friday showed. Clayton was killed Jan. 9 while confronting a murder suspect in a Wal-Mart parking lot. The autopsy confirmed much of what was previously released. One shot entered her neck at a downward angle, suggesting that she was on the ground when she was hit. The bullet partially exited her left upper back, according to the autopsy. Police previously said this was the fatal shot, although the autopsy did not specify. She also was shot in the lower stomach, buttocks and thigh. Clayton, 42, suffered cuts and bruises on her face. She did not have any alcohol or drugs in her system. Police say she was at the Wal-Mart on Princeton Street and John Young Parkway when someone came up to her and said they had spotted Markeith Loyd, who was wanted on murder charges in the death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon. When she confronted the 41-year-old Loyd, he opened fire, striking her in the thigh. She returned fire and hit him in the chest, but he was protected by a bulletproof vest. According to police, Loyd continued shooting even after Clayton fell to the ground. Clayton’s killing set off a massive manhunt for Loyd. It ended nine days later when he was arrested at an abandoned house. He’s charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of Clayton and Dixon, and faces a slew of other charges, including shooting at an Orange County deputy. Loyd is being held without bond at the Orange County Jail. dharris@orlandosentinel.com, 407-420-5471 or @DavidHarrisOS Caption Seminole High School student shot A student was shot outside Seminole High School in Sanford.

Amazon ranked as the world’s most valuable retail brand in the annual study by valuation and strategy consultancy Brand Finance. The company’s brand value, $106.4 billion, is nearly double that of Walmart ($62.2 billion), which ranked as the second most valuable retail brand. (An explanation of the ranking is provided at the end of article.)  Amazon also ranked as the third most valuable brand across all industries, just behind Google ($109.5 billion) and Apple ($107.1 billion). “The firm (amazon) is growing strongly as it continues to both reshape the retail market and to capture an ever larger share of it,” stated Brand Finance in a release. “Its brand value is already nearly double that of second-placed Walmart. Amazon Fresh, its grocery service, is still relatively limited in scale but this year began operating overseas for the first time, serving Central and East London initially. Rounding out the top five most valuable retail brands were Alibaba, with a brand value of $34.9 billion; The Home Depot, $30.2 billion; and Ikea, at $24.1 billion. Other top ranking retail brands included CVS, No. 6 with a brand value of $23.2 billion; Target, No.7 (brand value of $17 billion; Walgreens, No. 8 ($16 billion); Lowe’s, No.9 ($14 billion); and Costco, No.10 ($13.4 billion). The brands in the Brand Finance study are first evaluated to determine their power / strength (based on factors such as marketing investment, familiarity, loyalty, staff satisfaction and corporate reputation) and given a corresponding letter grade up to AAA+. Brand strength is used to determine what proportion of a business’s revenue is contributed by the brand, which is projected into perpetuity to determine the brand’s value.  Login or Register to post a comment. ﻿ Newsletter Sign Up Get the latest news sent to your inbox   Popular Most Commented Lowe’s by the numbers Evolution in the power tool aisle True Value makes gains in 2016 Bankruptcy for hhgregg In Search of: The Smartest Home in America HBSDealer Stock Watch: HBP jumps ahead Westlake paints a picture of growth Home furnishings giant plugs in another fuel cell system Study: More than half of U.S. shoppers haven’t tried BOPIS Readers Respond: Not so up-to-date Poll Poll When was your store's last major IT improvement project?

Independent Mail , KHOU 9:06 PM. CDT March 13, 2017 (Photo: Michael Madrid, USA TODAY) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST ANDERSON, S.C. — A Girl Scout's mother was punched and kicked as she tried to stop someone from stealing a money box from a cookie stand outside of the Powdersville Walmart on Sunday afternoon, according to an Anderson County Sheriff's Office report. Juli Spann has been volunteering with Girl Scouts for nearly two decades. She said she's sold cookies dozens of times over the years. Spann and her daughter were selling cookies around 2:15 p.m. Sunday when a woman came out of a black Jeep and went to a vending machine before asking if the Scouts had a newer $1 bill, according to a deputy's report. The women exchanged money and the woman from the Jeep went back to her vehicle several times before picking up several boxes of cookies and asking the driver of the Jeep what kind of cookies she wanted, according to the Sheriff's Office report. Spann said the woman paid $4 and grabbed a box containing about $300 from the Scouts' sales. The woman held the box for a few moments and stared at the girls before leaving, according to Spann, who said her daughter initially thought the woman was just joking with them. When Spann realized the woman was stealing the money, she tried to take the box back. "I wasn't going to let the girls lose that hard earned money," she said. There was a struggle for the money box and the thief punched and kicked Spann before getting into the Jeep to leave, according to Spann. The Girl Scout, whose age was not made public in the report, also tried to get the money back. According to Spann, employees and customers at Walmart also tried to help. Once the woman got away, Spann said Walmart employees spread the word that the money had been stolen and the troop saw an immediate increase in sales. Donations made since the incident have more than made up for what was lost, according to Karen Kelly, director of marketing and communications for Girl Scouts South Carolina-Mountains to Midlands. An emotional Spann said the most difficult thing about the theft was feeling like she let the girls down by not getting the box back, but she knows she did everything she could. "That woman was bold and brazen and no matter what we would've done, she would've taken it," she said. The deputy's report said video from Walmart confirms an assault on the volunteer and the theft of the money box. Spann said she didn't have any major injuries, but her hand was in some pain and she has a compression fracture in one vertebra. In a statement, a Walmart spokesman said customers and employees gave donations to the Girl Scouts after the theft. "It was great to see our associates and customers step forward to help these young ladies recoup the money they lost," the company said in the statement.   USA TODAY CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Investigation continues into report of shots fired at rodeo Viewer video: Chaos at RodeoHouston after reports of possible shooting 3 in custody after robbery at Pappas BBQ HPD responding to possible shooting at rodeo Popular gas station chain, Buc-ee's, sues roadside competitor Firefighters tackle blaze at refinery in Houston KHOU 11 Breaking News Navasota Train Death Vigil Rodeo attendees exit stadium following possible shooting Deadly fire in SE Houston More Stories Two arrests made in connection with suicide of Texas… Mar 16, 2017, 1:40 p.m. HPD: Bullet casing found on rodeo grounds, man arrested Mar 15, 2017, 10:03 p.m. 2 killed in fire at boarding house in SE Houston Mar 16, 2017, 4:40 a.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home Weather Health Detail Closings & Delays Location Search Radars Conditions Hurricane Central More...

Multinational companies have spent decades mastering the art of government relations in China. Now, as President Xi Jinping extends the Communist Party’s reach over policy making, they are starting to shift course. The Conference Board, whose 1,200 members include Nestle SA and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., is among those exploring how multinationals influence policy, including their greater focus on party organs. The research group expects to publish in May the results of a study on the “changing dynamic of party-state relations” to help foreign companies navigate the country’s vast and often secretive political superstructure. Xi Jinping Photographer: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg “As the Communist Party of China takes an increasingly active role in policy design and implementation, multinational companies need to think anew about government affairs strategies,” said Jude Blanchette, who’s managing the project for the Conference Board’s China Center. “Instead of going to the State Council to make their case, they’re going straight to the party leading small groups because they know that’s where the action is.” The party’s expanded policy role points to a broader shift in China’s political landscape, which had focused on bolstering government bodies in developing the economy after Mao Zedong’s ideologically charged leadership led to mass famine and political upheaval. Since taking power four years ago, Xi has reasserted the party’s supremacy -- with himself as its “core” leader -- over everything from executive functions to state-owned enterprises to the 3,000-member National People’s Congress meeting that wraps up this week in Beijing. Xi is seeking to centralize power while building a more innovative economy in which markets play a “ decisive role.” China this month set a 2017 economic growth target of “around 6.5 percent” -- the slowest pace in more than a quarter century -- as it focuses on easing financial risks from a credit boom. Greater party control doesn’t necessarily mean it will be harder for multinational companies to operate in China, according to Andrew Polk, the Beijing-based head of China research at Medley Global Advisors, which advises institutional investors. He cited an announcement earlier this month that gave local governments the ability to offer incentives to attract foreign investment. “It doesn’t make reform more or less likely at all -- it just makes it different,” Polk said. “The rules are a little less clear, there’s more uncertainty for businesses, but uncertainty can be a positive if it opens up opportunities you didn’t otherwise have.” In the 1980s, the architects of China’s economic opening sought to separate party and government functions following the catastrophic policy failures under Mao. Former leader Deng Xiaoping warned against “replacing the government with the party” while the reformist party chief Zhao Ziyang and other comrades traded their “Mao suits” for Western business attire. The titles of president and premier also gained prominence. “History has told us the party was not great at managing the economy,” said Deng Yuwen, a public affairs commentator in Beijing and a former deputy editor of Study Times, a leading Communist Party journal. “The reforms in the ’80s were a direct response to that lesson. Now, what we’re seeing is a thorough turnaround.” Zhao’s ouster after the 1989 crackdown on the Tiananmen pro-democracy protests began a shift back to empowering the party. That transition appeared all but complete when Wang Qishan -- the party’s No. 6 official and head of Xi’s signature anti-graft campaign -- told a March 5 meeting of NPC delegates that there was “only a division of labor between the party and the government, but no separation.”  Leading Groups Xi’s dominance has been emphasized in speech after speech during the NPC, as state leaders, ministers and provincial chiefs credited the country’s successes to the party’s “core” leader. NPC Chairman Zhang Dejiang called party leadership the “root and soul” of statehood in his March 8 report on legislative affairs. The NPC concludes Wednesday. The president’s chief policy-making instrument has been the “leading small groups,” party panels that have long been the ultimate agenda-setters for policies in all major aspects of national development. They have assumed a more hands-on role under Xi, who now leads more than 10 party bodies that set policy, including at least five that he created or took charge of that weren’t held by previous top leaders. They include a powerful financial and economic affairs committee previously led by the country’s premiers. Their influence has been on display in recent interactions with U.S. officials. Liu He, who handles the day-to-day affairs of the financial and economic small group, was among the four top Chinese officials that Steven Mnuchin spoke with after his confirmation as U.S. treasury secretary. Mnuchin’s predecessor, Jack Lew, similarly contacted Liu instead of Vice Premier Wang Yang -- the treasury chief’s traditional counterpart -- when concerns about China’s currency flared early last year. The increased power of the leading small groups has come at the expense of the State Council, China’s cabinet led by Premier Li Keqiang, and other parts of the bureaucracy still reeling from Xi’s anti-corruption campaign. That poses challenges to foreign companies who have invested decades learning the ins and outs of China’s bureaucracy. Read more about Xi’s anti-corruption campaign The party panels operate largely behind the scenes and their memberships are only sporadically publicized. Public remarks by influential leading group officials are even rarer than those of their government counterparts. Liu, for instance, doesn’t give a news briefing during the NPC like People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan or Finance Minister Xiao Jie. “The problem though is that the Communist Party both by temperament and design is much more closed than the State Council,” said Blanchette, the Conference Board’s engagement director for China. The group’s study aims to help multinationals get their concerns heard by party policy makers, he said. Liu He Photographer: Nelson Ching/Bloomberg Xi has created at least four small groups giving him new forums to manage national security, cyberspace and “deepening” economic reform. The latter panel  approved 12 policies last month alone, ranging from environmental monitoring to foreign residency to state media’s personnel, Xinhua said. In response, foreign companies have begun petitioning the leading groups. In November, a coalition of 43 international industry associations, including American Chamber of Commerce and the Trans-Atlantic Business Council, wrote the cyberspace panel letters to express concern about cybersecurity regulations.

Sign Up “They were sent to the leading group because it is a key policy body for cybersecurity issues and the associations wanted to convey their views directly to that organization,” said Kenneth Jarrett, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. Technology companies such as Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. have questioned the rules, which firms say could force to compromise security or exit the market. Those kinds of interactions are set to become more frequent. The elevation of the party is a sign that Xi is willing to sacrifice efficiency in policy making for loyalty and stability, according to Zhang Ming, a political science professor at Renmin University in Beijing.   “Now it’s absolutely clear that the party is back to the forefront of state management,” he said. “The party is here to stay and won’t recede in the future as far as I can see.” — With assistance by Ting Shi, and Peter Martin Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(AP) — When the Kmart in Paintsville closed, Sean Crowl assumed his only option was to become a cashier at Wal-Mart. The 29-year-old had an associate degree in English, but his only work experience was the few retail jobs available in this eastern Kentucky community hit hard by the loss of coal jobs. But when Interapt, a Louisville-based software company, offered a training program in eastern Kentucky with the help of a grant from the Appalachian Regional Commission, Crowl was one of 800 people to apply, 50 to be accepted and 35 to graduate. Now he's developing mobile apps as an intern in Interapt's eastern Kentucky office. "The fact that we were able to learn enough to work on those, build them from the ground up, get them to customers in 16 weeks is something I never thought would happen anywhere — let alone here," he said. At an event Monday with Silicon Valley Democratic U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, Interapt founder Ankur Gopal announced the company would begin a second class later this year. Interapt is one of several companies hoping to jump-start eastern Kentucky's economy by reinventing its workforce. A manufacturing school to teach out-of-work coal miners how to operate advanced computer numeric control machines is scheduled to open this year. And Bitsource, a software and website development company, has been coding for two years in Pikeville after hiring former coal miners. Khanna, who was elected in November, said he plans on "telling the positive story of this region in Silicon Valley, because so often you hear the negative." "I'm going to go back home and talk to tech leaders and say, 'Look what's going on here. You want to invest,'" he said. Programs like these have been a focus for Republican Gov. Matt Bevin, who has downplayed the value of traditional university degrees in favor of job training programs he says can be tailored to meet companies' needs. Bevin's budget last year included a proposal to borrow up to $100 million to refurbish some of the state's workforce training programs. Last month, the Bevin administration awarded $65.5 million to 25 projects at high schools and technical colleges. "All this nonsense that you've got to go to college and get a four-year degree and that's a ticket to ride ... and then you are set for life? Nonsense," Bevin said. "What are you studying? What are you doing with it? That's the question we need to ask ourselves." Eastern Kentucky is still struggling. In Johnson County, where Paintsville is the county seat, the unemployment rate in January was 10.1 percent, compared with 5.8 percent for Kentucky and 5.1 percent for the country. The region also continues to battle a prescription drug epidemic that contributes to Kentucky ranking among the highest in the country in overdose death rates. But local leaders say the hope is that, over time, the region could become what U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers calls "Silicon Holler." "I think this is a transformational change. You don't just change something like this overnight," Gopal said, adding: "We've never done more important work than this. And I want to continue to do it." Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Mar 13, 2017 at 3:28PM Think of Costco (NASDAQ:COST) as a retail take on the razor-and-blade business model. The warehouse club essentially breaks even on the discounted food and merchandise it sells, but it makes up for it with the windfall it realizes on the membership fees it charges for the privilege of shopping its stores. Although Costco doesn't raise its fees often -- every three to five years, on average, and the last time it did so was in 2011 -- it just announced a new membership fee hike beginning on June 1. It may seem long overdue, but it could be the worst time for it and a move the warehouse club will regret. Image source: Getty Images. Membership has its benefits Where merchandise sales comprised around 98% of Costco's total revenues of $57.9 billion over the first six months of its fiscal year, membership fees amounted to about three quarters of its $1.7 billion operating income. It had 47.6 million paying members at the end of 2016, most of whom (some 77%) were individual Gold Star members; businesses made up the rest. Executive members, Costco's highest level of membership, who earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases up to a maximum reward of $750 per year, represent 39% of its membership base, and they also account for around two-thirds of its sales. Costco enjoys an amazing renewal rate, with around 90% of its paid members renewing every year. It's a testament to their loyalty to the warehouse club, and when you consider Costco is only increasing the Gold Star fee by $5 to $60 a year, with the business membership going up $10 to $120 annually, it doesn't seem like it should be a big deal. After all, the average Costco shopper has an average annual income of $85,000 and is more affluent than the medium- to low-income wage earners that patronize Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). Its customers should be able to afford the nominal bump in fees and will even be rewarded since Executive members will see the maximum reward increased to $1,000 annually. Better late than never? Considering the quarter Costco just reported, it would seem now would be a good time to raise them, too. Net sales rose 6% as U.S. comparable-store sales increased 3% from last year, better than the 3% and 1% rise, respectively, it saw in the first quarter. It was also better than the 3% increase in sales it achieved a year ago when comps also rose 3%. However, now might not be the time to start raising costs on consumers. Costco's net income fell to $515 million from $546 million last year, as rising gas prices, investments in digital initiatives, and price cuts took a bite out of the bottom line. The problem is that Wal-Mart and other supermarket giants like Kroger (NYSE:KR) and even Target, are waging a war to retain and steal customers by cutting prices themselves. In particular, Wal-Mart, which has committed to being the discount destination for shoppers, reported one of its best quarters in more than four years, with revenues rising more than 1% to $130.9 billion on a 1.8% increase in comps, its 10th straight quarter with higher same-store sales. While that may appear to be an underwhelming performance compared to what Costco turned in, Wal-Mart is orders of magnitude larger than its rival, and it represents a significant gain for itself and over the competition. It could be that Wal-Mart stole customers from Kroger, as its own quarterly effort was a disappointment, but that just underscores why it is risky for Costco to be raising costs on its customers. Image source: Getty Images. Shrugging its shoulders For its part, Costco is dismissive of the competitive threat. While CFO Richard Galanti said the pricing actions by its rivals were "formidable," he essentially also said that's something they have to worry about, not Costco. It wasn't cutting prices because of the competition, but rather because of independent decisions it made. Whether that will amount to a blind spot remains to be seen, but consumers across the board are proving to be more price-conscious. Fast-casual dining chains, for example, a niche that would serve a demographic intuitively similar to Costco's, has been almost uniformly beset by lower sales and profits as fast-food chains promote pricing deals. The low-cost price proposition of Costco's rivals just as the warehouse club raises prices could be the tipping point that causes it to stumble.  It may seem to be only a de minimis increase in cost for Costco members, but it could be a price so high that new members may be unwilling to pay it.

Officers responded to a 911 call of shots fired outside the Walmart in the 7000 block of South Cicero Avenue at 12:22 p.m., according to Bedford Park police.

Cops say Trevor Summers, 39, kidnapped his estranged wife, Alisa, 37, on Saturday after manipulating his own daughter, 14, into leaving a window of her house open.  He then held her hostage for more than two days, they say, until a witness spotted them on Monday in Alisa's car in Ruskin, 25 miles from where she was last seen. Hillsborough County Sheriff David Gee said Alisa was freed while Trevor was hospitalized with 'a self-inflicted knife wound to the throat'. Gone: Alisa Summers (left and right) was kidnapped early Saturday morning by husband Trevor (left), police said. She was seen trying - and failing - to escape on Saturday night Kids: The estranged pair, who have five kids together, were found in her car in Ruskin, Florida. She was unharmed; Trevor was hospitalized with a 'self-inflicted, non-fatal cut to the throat' Knifepoint: In February Alisa told police he had kept her in his home at knifepoint for hours. He denied the claim and police did not prosecute Police were alerted to Alisa's plight on Saturday at 9.05pm, when she was seen bolting from her car outside a Walgreens on Fishhawk Crossing Boulevard only to be bundled back in by a man. But police said her ordeal began more than 15 hours earlier, as part of a twisted plot by her husband.  Trevor Summers has been separated from his wife since at least November, when she left him behind in Riverview and moved to Valrico, around 20 minutes away, with the children. Prior to her kidnapping, Trevor had been secretly communicating with their 14-year-old daughter, Gee said. He asked the girl, who is not being identified, to leave a window open in Alisa's Valrico home so that he could enter early on Saturday morning, the sheriff continued. Summers had told the girl he just wanted to head over and speak to Alisa, Gee claimed, and entered early in the morning, before telling the girl to wait in his car outside. At 5.30am Saturday he told the girl to drive her siblings to his Riverview home, 20 minutes away, saying he was going to speak to their mom over the course of the next day. Police were only notified 15 and a half hours later, at 9.05pm, when the Walgreens witness saw Alisa with her hands tied, trying to escape from her dark-blue Saturn Outlook. It's not yet clear why they stopped there. A fruitless day of searching followed, but on Monday morning a citizen spotted the vehicle in Ruskin.  The car drove a mile away and parked outside a house, but details given by a witness helped police isolate, locate and surround it. Manipulated: Cops say Trevor manipulated his 14-year-old daughter into leaving open a window in Alisa's home so he could sneak inside and kidnap her mom on Saturday morning Uniformed and plain-clothes deputies converged on the address. Gee said Trevor stayed in the front seat while Alisa exited from the rear. Trevor resisted arrest, Gee said, and has been hospitalized with what appeared to be a self-inflicted knife wound to the throat. It did not appear to be life-threatening, he said.  Alisa has a cut wound on her wrist but it's not known who inflicted it, or whether the kidnapper inflicted violence on her during her ordeal.  Police don't yet know his Trevor Summers' long-term plans were or why they were in Ruskin, but said those questions will be raised with Alisa. Trevor has been charged with kidnapping, theft of his wife's vehicle and a violation of a domestic injunction she had already taken out on him. He may be subject to more charges once police speak to local prosecutors. He is already to face sentencing on Wednesday after being found guilty of wire fraud and conspiracy last year.

Share this article Share Alone: Trevor told his daughter to drive her siblings to his house by herself at 5.30am, cops claim. He told her he wanted to talk to Alisa alone - but then he took the mom As the search for the missing woman intensified over the weekend, it emerged that she told police last month that Trevor Summers threatened her with a knife. When asked whether sheriff's deputies had not believed her claim, he said the situation was complicated by Trevor's conflicting statement, in which he denied her claim and said she shoved one of their children. 'The legal standards that we have to get to are very tough,' he said. As police searched for Alisa, it emerged that she told police and courts that he had threatened her with a knife prior to her disappearance - but they did nothing, the Tampa Bay Times reported.   The couple - whose children, aged 3-14, are being cared for by Trevor Summers' father - had suffered a deteriorating relationship over the past six months, including claims of violence. On October 31 she asked a judge for a domestic violence injunction, but her request was dismissed. In November, her Facebook page says, she moved to Valrico - around 20 minutes from her husband in Riverview - and in December she filed for divorce. Chillingly, on February 21 she filed for another protection order, claiming that after she had gone to his home to discuss a divorce settlement, Trevor had threatened her with a knife. Vehicle: Alisa was seen trying to bolt from her car (pictured) outside a Walgreens on Saturday night. She failed, but police were called in. They were in the car when found Monday She claimed he had held her against her will, and threatened to tie her up with duct tape and rope.  The following day, he filed for a protective order against her, saying she had made up the claims and had angrily pushed their 12-year-old son into a corner. Police made no arrests because they only had the two statements to act on. Speaking on Monday morning, Trevor's own lawyer, Hope Lefeber, said she was shocked to hear the claims about her client. She said he was a Christian man with no violent criminal record. 'I know he always wanted to work out his marriage,' she said. The breakdown of the couple's relationship may well have been spurred on by Trevor Summers' conviction for wire fraud and conspiracy on September 16 last year. Summers, who was to be sentenced Wednesday, pleaded guilty to trying to defraud investors out of at least $345,000 with a scheme to print advertisements on straws. Con artist:  Trevor pleaded guilty in September to wire fraud and conspiracy charges after prosecutors said he tried to con at least $345,000 out of investors in his business One of his victims, high school friend Krissy Flynn, 39, invested $10,000 in his scheme, and says he was 'brilliant but weird'. He bought cell phones for his staff on the project, but the phones ran out when bills went unpaid.   'I don't trust this guy for a second,' Flynn said. 'He's a brilliant person, and he knows how to scam money out of people.' A federal lawsuit against him in 2008 said he had more than 20 civil suits filed against him and that he'd filed for bankruptcy three times between 2004 and 2008. It also claimed he had served probation for minor charges such as passing bad checks.  And in 2011 he lost a $4milion judgement although it's not known whether the plaintiffs collected.

(file photo)  Charged is Anthony R. Montana, of Belvidere. Mansfield Township police said Montana stole the items from the supermarket on Feb. 15. He later entered Wal-Mart and was successful in gaining a gift card for returning the stolen items, according to police. Police do not state in a news release the value or what was stolen. N.J. man allegedly hides under bed to avoid arrest Once investigators were on to Montana, they alerted Wal-Mart representatives, who canceled the gift card, according to police. Montana was charged at 3:46 p.m. Sunday and was later released, pending a court appearance. Pamela Sroka-Holzmann may be reached at pholzmann@lehighvalleylive.com. Follow her on Twitter @pamholzmann.

Picture taken February 7, 2017. REUTERS/Eddie KeoghMore LONDON (Reuters) - Asda, the British supermarket owned by Wal-Mart , is offering staff in its stores a 14 percent rise in hourly pay, if they sign a contract requiring more flexible working. Britain's No. 3 supermarket said on Monday it will offer its 135,000 store staff a base rate of 8.50 pounds ($10.39) an hour from October, up from 7.44 pounds. The new rate is 1 pound above the government mandated National Living Wage increase which comes into effect April 1. The new contract will require Asda staff to work in different parts of stores and different days or hours, including public holidays. All breaks will also move to being unpaid. Asda's move comes as the Bank of England is closely watching a pick-up in inflation for signs it might fuel higher pay settlements. Asda said that 95 percent of current employees will be better off if they move to the new contract. If they do not, their base rate will move up to the minimum national rate of 7.50 pounds and they will retain their existing contract. Asda, which trails market leader Tesco and Sainsbury's by annual sales, has been the sector laggard for the last two years. However, a trading update last month showed it had stemmed the pace of sales decline, suggesting new CEO Sean Clarke's focus on pricing and product quality was starting to have an impact.

Tony Cardenas, D-Calif., left, and Rep. Raul Ruiz, D-Calif., pause as members of the committee argue the details of the GOP's "Obamacare" replacement bill after working all night, Thursday, March 9, 2017on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) By Dan Georgakas Congressional proposals regarding health care reform have begun to circulate. An expose in the Chicago Tribune (Dec. 15) offers insights into the complex details effective health reforms must confront. The Tribune’s investigative reporters focused on how pharmacies react when given prescriptions involving a dangerous combination of drugs. Many drugs that are relatively safe when used independently are dangerous when combined. An example of perilous combinations is the pairing of clarithromycin, an anti-biotic drug, with simvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug. If both are taken, muscular tissue is destroyed and kidney failure and even death may result. The Tribune reporters presented some dangerous prescriptions simultaneously and others a few days apart. The findings were horrific. More than half of all pharmacies failed to alert patients about the dangers of incompatible prescriptions. The failure rate for CVS, the nation’s largest chain was the highest: 63%. Costco and Kmart tied for second with 60% each. Walmart had a 40% failure rate and Walgreen’s 30%, a percentage that looks good only in comparison to its competitors. Pharmacies technically fulfill their legal obligation to inform their customers of the dangers of dangerous interactions of drugs with the printed inserts they include with each prescription. Many state courts have ruled such warnings are insufficient as patients are unlikely to understand them, if they even read them. Computers at pharmacies are programmed to catch dangerous combos before they are filled. Pharmacists, however, note that the system often reports every conceivable bad interaction, however remote. This renders them virtually meaningless. They are often ignored. Making matters worse is that companies do not allow sufficient time for pharmacists to study the data. The New Hampshire Board of Pharmacies reports that its pharmacies spend an average of 80 seconds on safety checks. The business model of pharmaceutical chains treats prescriptions like fast food which means an emphasis on speed rather than quality. Walmart prescriptions are often filled in two minutes, not much time to do more than count pills and pack. CVS gives each of its outlets a monthly score on how fast they have filled orders compared to other CVS local, regional, and national outlets. Rewards go to those who have worked the fastest. Unionized pharmacies have struggled to establish enough staffing and time for safety checks. They also point out that the chains allow time to pitch company promotions while limiting the time for safety alerts. The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy with its emphasis on professional standards has similar goals. Pharmacies are the final defense against errors. The actual prescription originates in a physician’s office. Any competent doctor will be sure to review the drugs being taken by patients at each appointment. This is especially pertinent for patients having different doctors for different conditions. The patient needs to be sure each of the doctors knows what the other is prescribing. National studies show that 50% of all patients do not take their drugs as prescribed but assure their doctor they do. Patients also rarely report on vitamins, herbs, and over-the counter medicine they take regularly, all of which can interact dangerously with prescription drugs or each other. Patients who report false data are risking their well-being as a doctor may increase doses to dangerous levels or reduce them to ineffective levels. Determining proper drug doses and combinations takes time. Many medical organizations pressure doctors to spend just 15-30 minutes per patient which greatly limits the quality of the examination and discourages timid patients from asking many questions. The rationale for this time frame is linked to profits rather than diagnostic and treatment concerns. These dosage problems reveal a basic problem in our general health care model. Rather than being focused on outcomes, it often emphasizes speed and “efficient use of time,” usually defined in monetary, not health terms. One result is that although the United States has the highest per person medical costs in the world, its outcomes are inferior to other advanced nations. That doesn’t mean our system is third-rate, but it is not even a contender for the top ten. Regulation has become a dirty word in Washington. The example of the pharmacy follies just outlined indicates why health care providers cannot be given a free hand. We are also left to question what other ethical and procedural shortcuts are being taken by health-care institutions. When we consider health care reforms, strictly enforced regulations with severe penalties for what is virtual malpractice needs to be at the forefront of our concern. Numerous states have laws that require pharmacies to contact doctors regarding dubious combinations before filling them. Unfortunately not much effort is made to enforce those regulations and penalties for failure to report are rare. The quality of health care rises and costs are lowered by safety checks that prevent easily avoidable dangerous combinations that result in costly emergency room services, hospitalization, and permanent injury. Five or more prescribed drugs are taken by more than 10% of all Americans, making them at risk for taking dangerous drug combinations. That number includes about 100,000 to 150,000 Greek-Americans. Bettering the system of how prescriptions are determined and fulfilled does not involve subjective ideological speculations, just common sense.

According to a Sheriff's Office statement, at 2:15 p.m. Sunday a woman and her daughter were selling Girl Scout cookies outside the Walmart when the woman got out of a black Jeep, went to the vending machine behind the table where the cookies were being sold and asked if the sellers had a newer $1 bill. After the two women exchanged money, the woman who had been in the Jeep went back to that vehicle several times before walking back to the table, picking up several boxes of cookies and asking the driver of the Jeep what kind the driver would like, according to the Sheriff's Office statement. The woman who was selling cookies with her daughter said the other woman picked up a box of cookies and paid $4 before grabbing the box full of Girl Scout money. The woman who was selling cookies said she tried to retrieve the box but was kicked several times, according to the statement.

In Arkansas, we went to Bentonville to visit the Crystal Bridges Museum, which one of my wife’s friends had recommended. Founded by Alice Walton, the daughter and one of the heirs of Walmart creator Sam Walton, Crystal Bridges Museum is a museum of American art. The museum opened its doors on Nov. 11, 2011 [November is the 11th month]. Before leaving the museum, we ate dinner at the museum’s restaurant, 11. If you’re interested, the museum offers free admission, complete with headphones supplying interesting information about the artwork. The museum has many pieces of art that I found fascinating, including a piece titled “Bad Lawn,” that looks exactly like its title. This is not a painting but rather what appears to be a small section of a lawn, complete with dying grass and thriving weeds. Another interesting piece is the figure of a life-size man, resting on a bench. Yet another piece of art depicts a chimpanzee contemplating an ape skull. In his right hand, he holds a well-worn copy of Charles Darwin’s Descent of Man. The art that I found most striking, however, consisted of two paintings, one by John Haberle and the other by Victor Dubreuil. You can be forgiven if you’ve never heard of these artists, as I had never heard of them either. Haberle lived from 1856 to 1933 and has been called an “American Master of Money Paintings.” Little is known about Dubreuil other than that he seemed to be obsessed with money in his paintings. Both men were painters in the trompe l’oeil style. Trompe l’oeil is French for “fool the eye.” Paintings in this style aim to deceive the viewer, to depict items with such realism that the viewer will perceive them as real. Haberle painted in this style until 1893, when failing eyesight prevented him from performing the precise work necessary to create his “illusions.” Haberle first encountered trompe l’oeil painting in 1884, when he took some classes at New York City’s National Academy of Design. As a painter in this style, Haberle was one of a number of artists working in America at about the same time. Two others were William Harnett and John F. Peto. Comparing the three men, art historian Alfred Frankenstein wrote: “Peto is moved by the pathos of used-up things. Haberle is wry and wacky, full of bravado, self-congratulating virtuosity, and sly flamboyance. He works largely within an old tradition, that of the trompe l’oeil still life in painted line.… It is poles away from Harnett’s sumptuosity [having a quality of lavishness], careful balances and well-modeled volumes, and is equally far from Peto’s sensitivity in matters of tone and hue.” Frankenstein also pronounced Haberle the “greatest American master of the [trompe l’oeil] tradition.” About Dubreuil he wrote: “He was obsessed with money, doubtless, because he never had any.” Painted by Haberle in 1887, “Small Change” is an oil on canvas still life depicting four pieces of money: the reverse of a well-worn 1787 Colonial piece, two pieces of Fractional Currency, and the reverse of a silver three-cent piece. The top piece of currency is a 10 cent shinplaster with the head of William Meredith. Meredith was the Treasury secretary during the brief term of Zachary Taylor (March 1849 to July 1860). The bottom bill is a 25-cent piece with George Washington’s head on it. Although the 10-cent bill is well worn, it is basically intact. By contrast, the 25-cent note is worn out, with a missing segment extending into Washington’s portrait. This gap appears to be crudely filled with a postage stamp, the back of which is visible. At the very bottom of the painting, ostensibly stuck into the frame, is the silver three-cent piece. It’s next to what appears to be a tiny photo of a bearded gentleman. According to the museum’s write-up for the painting, this “…is a self-portrait which Haberle likely included to defy these authorities [U.S. Secret Service] and express pride in his work. He also included humorous personal references such as the signature with stick figure that seems to be carved into the surface.” This is located in the upper right corner of the painting. Printing above and to the right of the stick figure reads, “J. Haberle 1887 New Haven CT.” Painted in 1896, when the artist was 16, Dubreuil’s painting is titled “The Cross of Gold.” On it, what appear to be five well-worn pieces of paper money are arranged in the form of a simple cross. The denominations are $1, $2, $5, $10, and $20. According to one write-up I found online, “Walmart cash has bought the painted cash you see here.” This refers, of course, to the purchase of the painting for the Crystal Bridges collection. I also found reference to Dubreuil’s painting in a 1988 piece from The New York Times. “A classic of the money-painting genre, and a star item in the show, is a painting from 1896 entitled ‘The Cross of Gold,’ by Victor Dubreuil, the same artist who rendered barrels stuffed with bills. Titled after William Jennings Bryan’s famous populist speech, it depicts a half-dozen [I counted only five] silver certificates[,] the currency favored by Western and Southern states but for many years opposed by Northeastern establishment bankers[,] in the form of a cross that is pinned to the wall with four shiny golden nails.” The Times article also mentioned recently deceased Stephen Boggs, a present-day trompe l’oeil painter of money. Boggs used his realistic paintings to barter for food, clothing, and other things he needed. Like his 19th-century predecessors, Boggs frequently run afoul of the U.S. Secret Service on the issue of counterfeiting. If you’re ever in the vicinity of Bentonville, Ark., by all means pay a visit to the Crystal Bridges Museum. It’s a treasure house of American art and the repository of several paintings and sculptures in the trompe l’oeil tradition.   This article was originally printed in Coins Magazine. >> Subscribe today.   More Collecting Resources • The Standard Catalog of United States Paper Money is the only annual guide that provides complete coverage of U.S. currency with today’s market prices. • Order the Standard Catalog of World Paper Money, General Issues to learn about circulating paper money from 14th century China to the mid 20th century.

Williamson March 13, 2017 4:00 AM @kevinNR U.S. corporate activism tilts overwhelmingly to the left. The Organization Man, whom we first met in 1956, is still very much with us. And his eccentric career since that time partly answers a question that mystifies many contemporary conservatives: Given that progressives profess to hate corporations, why are our corporate leaders so progressive? It is easy to understand their taking a self-interested stand against the Trump administration over things such as the H-1B program and visa waivers, which interfere with their access to workers and customers, respectively. But 130 corporate leaders — including the CEOs of American Airlines and Bank of America — getting together to come down on North Carolina over public-bathroom rules that annoy transgender activists? Together with business leaders who have no presence in North Carolina and nothing to do with the state or its politics? Is it only cravenness — or something more? In the progressive lexicon, the word “corporation” is practically a synonym for “evil.” Corporations, in the progressive view, are so stoned on greed and ripped on ruthlessness that they present an existential threat to democracy as we know it. When the Left flies into a mad rage about . . . whatever, the black-bloc terrorists don’t burn down the tax office or the police station: They smash the windows of a Starbucks, never mind CEO Howard Schultz’s impeccably lefty credentials. Weird thing, though: With the exception of a few big shiny targets such as Koch Industries (the nation’s second-largest privately held concern, behind Cargill) and Walmart (the nation’s largest private employer), the Left’s corporate enemies list is dominated by relatively modest concerns: Chick-fil-A, which, in spite of its recent growth spurt, is only a fraction of the size of McDonald’s or YUM Brands; Hobby Lobby, which is not even numbered among the hundred largest private U.S. companies; Waffle House, a regional purveyor of mediocre grits and a benefactor of Georgia Republicans. Carl’s Jr. was founded by a daily communicant and Knight of Malta, a man who had some not-very-progressive opinions about gay rights. But even in its new role as part of a larger corporate enterprise (the former CEO of which, Andrew Puzder, had been nominated for secretary of labor), the poor man’s answer to In-N-Out is not exactly in a position to inflict ultramontane Catholicism on the world at large, though the idea of a California Classic Double Inquisition with Cheese is not without charm. Far from being agents of reaction, our corporate giants have for decades been giving progressives a great deal to celebrate. Disney, despite its popular reputation for hidebound wholesomeness, has long been a leader on gay rights, much to the dismay of a certain stripe of conservative. Walmart, one of the Left’s great corporate villains, has barred Confederate-flag merchandise from its stores in a sop to progressive critics, and its much-publicized sustainability agenda is more than sentiment: Among other things, it has invested $100 million in economic-mobility programs and doubled the fuel efficiency of its vehicle fleet over ten years. Individual members of the Walton clan engage in philanthropy of a distinctly progressive bent. In fact, just going down the list of largest U.S. companies (by market capitalization) and considering each firm’s public political activism does a great deal to demolish the myth of the conservative corporate agenda. Top ten: 1) Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, is an up-and-down-the-line progressive who has been a vociferous critic of religious-liberty laws in Indiana and elsewhere that many like-minded people consider a back door to anti-gay discrimination. 2) When protesters descended on SFO to protest President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration, one of the well-heeled gentlemen leading them was Google founder Sergey Brin, and Google employees were the second-largest corporate donor bloc to President Barack Obama’s reelection campaign. 3) Microsoft founder Bill Gates is a generous funder of programs dedicated to what is euphemistically known as “family planning.” 4) Berkshire Hathaway’s principal, Warren Buffett, is a close associate of Barack Obama’s and an energetic advocate of redistributive tax increases on high-income taxpayers. 5) Amazon’s Jeff Bezos put up $2.5 million of his own money for a Washington State gay-marriage initiative. 6) Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg has pushed for liberal immigration-reform measures, while Facebook cofounder Dustin Moskovitz pledged $20 million to support Hillary Rodham Clinton and other Democrats in 2016. 7) Exxon, as an oil company, may be something of a hate totem among progressives, but it has spent big — billions big — on renewables and global social programs. 8) Johnson & Johnson’s health-care policy shop is run by Liz Fowler, one of the architects of Obamacare and a former special assistant to President Obama. 9) The two largest recipients of JPMorgan cash in 2016 were Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Democratic National Committee, and the bank’s billionaire chairman, Jamie Dimon, is a high-profile supporter of Democratic politicians including Barack Obama and reportedly rejected an offer from President Trump to serve as Treasury secretary. 10) Wells Fargo employees followed JPMorgan’s example and donated $7.36 to Mrs. Clinton for every $1 they gave to Trump, and the recently troubled bank has sponsored events for the Human Rights Campaign, GLAAD, and other gay-rights groups, as well as donated to local Planned Parenthood franchises. Even the hated Koch brothers are pro-choice, pro-gay, and pro-amnesty. You may see the occasional Tom Monaghan or Phil Anschutz, but, on balance, U.S. corporate activism is overwhelmingly progressive. Why? For one thing, conservatives are cheap dates. You do not have to convince the readers of National Review or Republicans in Valparaiso that American business is in general a force for good in the world. But if you are, e.g., Exxon, you might feel the need to convince certain people, young and idealistic and maybe a little stupid in spite of their expensive educations, that you are not so bad after all, and that you are spending mucho shmundo “turning algae into biofuel,” in the words of one Exxon advertisement, and combating malaria and doing other nice things. All of that is true, and Exxon makes sure people know it. The professional activists may sneer and scoff, but they are not the audience. Even if it were only or mainly a matter of publicity (and it isn’t — Shell, among other oil majors, is putting real money into renewables and alternative energy), big companies such as Exxon and Apple would still have a very strong incentive to engage in progressive activism rather than conservative activism. For one thing, there is a kind of moral asymmetry at work: Conservatives may roll their eyes a little bit at promises to build windmills so efficient that we’ll cease needing coal and oil, but progressives (at least a fair portion of them) believe that using fossil fuels may very well end human civilization. The nation’s F-150 drivers are not going to organize a march on Chevron’s headquarters if it puts a billion bucks into biofuels, but the nation’s Subaru drivers might very well do so if it doesn’t. The same asymmetry characterizes the so-called social issues. The Left will see to it that Brendan Eich is driven out of his position at Mozilla for donating to an organization opposed to gay marriage, but the Right will not see to it that Tim Cook is driven out of his position for supporting gay marriage. For the Right, the question of gay marriage is an important moral and political disagreement, but for the Left the exclusion of homosexual couples from the legal institution of marriage was something akin to Jim Crow, and support for it isn’t erroneous, it is wicked. Even those on the right who proclaim that they regard the question of homosexual relationships as a national moral emergency do not behave as though they really believe it: Remember that boycott of Disney theme parks launched with great fanfare by the American Family Association, Focus on the Family, and the Southern Baptist Convention back in 1996? Nothing happened, because conservative parents are not telling their toddlers that they cannot go to Disney World because the people who run the park are too nice to that funny blonde lady who has the talk show and dances in the aisles with her audience. The issues that conservatives tend to see as life-and-death issues are actual life-and-death issues, abortion prominent among them. But even among right-leaning corporate types, pro-life social conservatism is a distinctly minority inclination. And that is significant, because a great deal of corporate activism is CEO-driven rather than shareholder-driven or directly rooted in the business interests of the firm. Like Wall Street bankers, who may not like their tax bills or Dodd-Frank but who tend in the main to be socially liberal Democrats, the CEOs of major U.S. corporations are, among other things, members of a discrete class. The graduates of ten colleges accounted for nearly half of the Fortune 500 CEOs in 2012; one in seven of them went to one school: Harvard. A handful of metros in California, Texas, and New York account for a third of Fortune 1000 headquarters — and there are 17 Fortune 1000 companies in one zip code in Houston. Unsurprisingly, people with similar backgrounds, similar experiences, and similar occupations tend to see the world in a similar way. “A new breed of chief executive is emerging — the CEO activist,” wrote Leslie Gaines-Ross, of Weber Shandwick, a global PR giant that advises Microsoft and had the unenviable task of working with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on the ACA rollout. “A handful of CEOs are standing up and standing out on some of the most polarizing issues of the day, from climate change and gun control, to race relations and same-sex marriage.” Hence chief executives’ joining en masse the great choir of hysteria on the question of toilet law in the Tar Heel State. Whereas the ancient corporate practice was to decline to take a public position on anything not related to their businesses, contemporary CEOs feel obliged to act as public intellectuals as well as business managers. Many of them are genuine intellectuals: Gates, PepsiCo’s Indra Nooyi, Goldman Sachs’s Lloyd Blankfein. And, like Hollywood celebrities, almost all of them are effectively above money. Some of them are rock-star entrepreneurs. But most of them are variations on the Organization Man, veterans of MBA programs, management consultancies, financial firms, The supplanting of spontaneous order with political discipline is the essence of progressivism, then and now. and 10,000 corporate-strategy meetings. If you have not read it, spare a moment for William H. Whyte’s Cold War classic. In the 1950s, Whyte, a writer for Fortune, interviewed dozens of important CEOs and found that they mostly rejected the ethos of rugged individualism in favor of a more collectivist view of the world. The capitalists were not much interested in defending the culture of capitalism. What he found was that the psychological and operational mechanics of large corporations were much like those of other large organizations, including government agencies, and that American CEOs believed, as they had believed since at least the time of Frederick Winslow Taylor and his 19th-century cult of “scientific management,” that expertise deployed through bureaucracy could impose rationality on such unruly social entities as free markets, culture, family, and sexuality. The supplanting of spontaneous order with political discipline is the essence of progressivism, then and now. It is hardly a new idea. The old robber barons were far from being free-enterprise men: J. P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie, like many businessmen of their generation, believed strongly in state-directed collusion among firms (they’d have said “coordination”) to avoid “destructive competition.” You can draw a straight intellectual line from their thinking to Barack Obama’s views about state-directed “investments” in alternative energy or medical research. It is not difficult to see the temptations of that approach from the point of view of a Bill Gates or a Warren Buffett: The decisions they have made for themselves have turned out well, so why not empower them, or men like them, to make decisions for other people, too? They may even be naïve or arrogant enough to believe that their elevated stations in life have liberated them from self-interest. Populists of the Trump variety and the Sanders variety (who are not in fact as different as they seem) are not wrong to see these corporate cosmopolitans as members of a separate, distinct, and thriving class with economic and social interests of its own. Those interests overlap only incidentally and occasionally with those of movement conservatives — and overlap even less as the new nationalist-populist strain in the Republican party comes to dominate the debate on questions such as trade and immigration. Under attack from both the right and the left, free enterprise and free trade increasingly are ideas without a party. As William H. Whyte discovered back in 1956, the capitalists are not prepared to offer an intellectual defense of capitalism or of classical liberalism. They believe in something else: the managers’ dream of command and control. — Kevin D. Williamson is National Review’s roving correspondent.

(iStock Photo) Print Email Beau Evans, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune By Beau Evans, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune The Times-Picayune Email the author on March 12, 2017 at 9:03 PM comments A couple of shoplifting suspects led police on a short car chase in Metairie after one of them hit a Kenner police officer in the mouth in the parking lot outside a Wal-Mart Sunday evening (March 12). The two suspects were arrested once officers stopped the fleeing vehicle, according to Kenner Police Department spokesman Lieutenant Brian McGregor. Around 7 p.m., a Kenner police officer working a detail at the Wal-Mart on Veterans Memorial Boulevard went to detain a man and a woman suspected of shoplifting from the store, McGregor said. The woman then hit the officer in the mouth, and both suspects hopped into a vehicle and fled from the parking lot. Pursued by police, the pair took a right on Veterans, a right on David Drive then a right on West Napoleon Avenue before officers managed to stop the vehicle. McGregor said the two suspects were arrested, but he did not immediately have information on what charges they may face.

Vivid Toy Group, Britain’s biggest independent toy maker, has been bought by Privet Capital from Phoenix Equity Partners for an undisclosed sum.  It was set up in 1993 and makes toys under licence, including Thunderbirds, Bratz Dolls, Animagic, Articulate and Crayola.

(WISH photo) INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) – Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department’s administration has analyzed its pursuit policy for almost a year. Changes to the policy are on the horizon to ensure the policy is safe for citizens and officers. IMPD Chief Bryan Roach released statistics on pursuit numbers for police departments comparable or larger than Indianapolis. In June 2015, a vehicle that police were pursuing crashed into Donna Niblock, 63, and killed the grandmother. The crash injured LaDonna Rogers, 37, Indianapolis and an 11-year-old boy was also critically hurt in the crash. Police later arrested and charged 21-year-old Matthew Edmonds at the scene of South State Avenue and Prospect Street on the city’s southeast side. Police say that officers were pursuing Edmonds at one point for stealing a pair of jeans at a Wal-Mart. IMPD released the department’s pursuit statistics for the past two years, including 2017’s numbers: 2015 – 462 pursuits 2016 – 464 pursuits 2017 – 106 pursuits Those numbers were accumulated from a staff that includes 1,635 IMPD officers. However, the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department in North Carolina has a larger police department that includes 1,906 officers, and less pursuits. Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department pursuit numbers: 2015 – 34 pursuits 2016 – 48 pursuits 2017 – 9 pursuits 24-Hour News 8 has learned that the Charlotte Police Department has more restrictions on when officers can and can’t pursue a vehicle. Currently, IMPD is working with the Fraternal Order of Police (police union) to determine what policy may or may not be best for the city of Indianapolis. Despite the discussion, much of the framework for the new policy is in place, and Roach made it known he is anxious to get something done. “We are concerned about the number of pursuits here in Indianapolis and we are working to tighten that policy down, ” said Roach. We could learn more about IMPD’s pursuit policy in the coming months.

And as usual, the party has it wrong (“Legislators work to undo cities’ rules,” March 13). Rep. Pat Garofalo, R-Farmington, says that “the cultural values of Minneapolis are drastically out of alignment with greater Minnesota, so there’s going to be conflicts.” Well, actually it’s the other way around: The values of politicians like Garofalo are “out of alignment” with the views of the majority of the Twin Cities metro area, where 60 percent of Minnesotans live. One has to ask: What “values” is this politician citing? Are plastic bags, no sick leave and (God help us) permits for using bike lanes that critical to outstate voters? Do they really want state mandates that trump (so to speak) reasonable local ones? Are Garofalo’s values the same ones that are driving many young people to the Twin Cities? Perhaps if the Republicans really stood for the values that historically have defined Minnesota, they wouldn’t have to hyphenate their high schools and gerrymander their way into power. Doug Wilhide, Minneapolis • • • Perhaps Garofalo and like-thinking persons from the rest of the state will very much want to avoid the “conflicts” they will encounter when entering this cultural wasteland known as the Twin Cities. Let’s see — that would include games for the Twins, Wild, Vikings, Loons, Gophers and Timberwolves; performances at the Guthrie, Northrop, Walker, MIA, Ordway, Orchestra Hall and numerous other smaller venues, as well as visits to HCMC, Abbott Northwestern, the University of Minnesota Medical Center and the State Fair, just to name a few. As a decades-long resident of Minneapolis (just moved to Bloomington), I can only imagine how my cultural values are in need of re-imagining, especially at the behest of the likes of the good representative. Here’s the deal: We are all Minnesotans. We are in this deal together. We Twin Citians won’t denigrate the Eelpout Festival in Walker, the Fiesta Days in Montevideo, Defeat of Jesse James Days in Northfield (and on and on), and we’ll still go “Up North” and spend our millions, just so long as the rest of you let us do our thing here in the great cesspool of culture we choose to live in. Paul Linnee, Bloomington • • • When reading about pending legislation proposed by outstate Republican legislators, it appears the supposed divide between urban and rural is between special interests with economic objectives. How does a plastic bag ban in Minneapolis have deleterious effects on a shopper at Wal-Mart in Pine City? Do constituents of Rep. Duane Quam really think bikers in cities should have a permit to use bike lanes? Perhaps farmers should have permits to drive tractors down the road. I was outstate for 33 years, and not once did I feel as though Twin Cities ordinances had an effect on me. The real elephant in the room is ALEC (the American Legislative Exchange Council) and legislators who are members and adhere to that organization’s philosophy. Chuck Justice, Woodbury AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT The impact, the obligation, the media coverage, the history I was alarmed to read that Minnesota stands to lose as much as $80 million over the next five years under the proposed American Health Care Act (front page, March 13). Public health programs play an essential role creating the healthy Minnesota we all enjoy, and such a drastic cut in funding would hurt many Minnesotans. Just as physicians strive to improve the health of an individual patient, public health professionals work to improve the health of communities. From helping new mothers keep their babies healthy, to increasing access to cancer screening, to making sure the elderly maintain access to flu vaccines, public health programs create healthy communities for all of us. Not only does public health make our communities healthier, it also saves money. By investing in programs that keep Minnesotans healthy and prevent illnesses from progressing, public health programs reduce the burden on our health care system and reduce health care costs. If, instead of cutting public health funding, we invested just $10 per person per year in programs proven to increase physical activity, improve nutrition and prevent tobacco use, the U.S. could save more than $16 billion annually within five years. Cutting public health funding would make Minnesotans more sick and waste money. At a time when our nation is struggling to stay healthy and contain health care costs, it would be foolish to defund these critical prevention programs. Annie Krapek, Minneapolis The writer is a public health professional. • • • My handy pocket-size copy of the U.S. Constitution quite clearly states that promotion of the general welfare is inherent in our values. Maintaining a healthy population via prevention appears to be anathema to the Republican Party, at the expense of everyone else. Richard A. Pommier, Long Prairie, Minn. • • • The misleading media is shouting about 14 million people who may lose their health insurance under the proposed new AHCA. What the Congressional Budget Office report actually says is most of that number is voluntary: “CBO and JCT estimate that, in 2018, 14 million more people would be uninsured under the legislation than under current law. Most of that increase would stem from repealing the penalties associated with the individual mandate. Some of those people would choose not to have insurance because they chose to be covered by insurance under current law only to avoid paying the penalties, and some people would forgo insurance in response to higher premiums.” Bill Coleman, Plymouth • • • I’m on the White House mailing list and received an e-mail declaring that Obamacare was a “total failure” and inviting me to share my story of what happened to me under Obamacare. So I did. I told the White House that my daughter developed a serious health condition when she was 17, but that she was able to stay on our family’s health insurance because of Obamacare. I don’t know how we would have afforded her care otherwise. When she turned 26, she was able to get on other insurance regardless of her preexisting condition because Obamacare prevented insurance companies from rejecting people like her. Overall, Obamacare was a godsend for our family. I told the White House that I expected it wouldn’t use my story because I didn’t trash Obamacare and that seems to be all the White House and the Republicans want to hear. Although they don’t want to hear about the success stories, I hope others do, because good news about Obamacare isn’t fake news. My story and many others’ stories are real. Michael Jaes, Roseville SURDYK’S PENALTY City was shortsighted It is unfortunate that the city of Minneapolis acted so hastily to invoke an ill-conceived penalty on the Surdyk’s liquor store (“Nasty hangover for Surdyk’s,” March 14). The small, $2,000 cash penalty pales compared with the value of the publicity, fame and profits for that Sunday of sales. The loss of state and federal tax collections from the July liquor license suspension will be substantial on an average $2 million to $3 million in monthly sales. It would have been more tax-effective to the state to impose a penalty equal to the profits of that day of sales, or the profits from the month of July, which would preserve substantial tax collections. We expect more from our political leadership that only continues to let us down.

Evan Vucci/AP hide caption toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP White House Director of Strategic Initiatives Christopher Liddell (from left) with Dell CEO Michael Dell and General Dynamics CEO Phebe Novakovic during a meeting with President Trump on Feb. 23. Evan Vucci/AP Federal records indicate that a key adviser to President Trump held substantial investments in 18 companies when he joined Trump in meetings with their CEOs. The investments of Christopher Liddell, the president's director of strategic initiatives, totaled between $3 million and $4 million. Among the companies in Liddell's portfolio, and whose CEOs were in the meetings: Dell Technologies, Dow Chemical, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, Lockheed Martin and Wal-Mart. When Trump conferred with the chiefs of Ford, General Motors and Fiat-Chrysler last month, Liddell attended the session. He was invested in all three companies at the time. Politics Trump Ethics Monitor: Has The President Kept His Promises? Details of Liddell's investments are contained in documents he filed with the White House ethics officer in preparation for divesting his holdings. He was seeking certificates of divestiture, which allow federal appointees to defer paying capital-gains taxes by reinvesting in a blind trust or similar arrangement. The watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a complaint Tuesday with White House Counsel Donald McGahn, raising concerns that Liddell may have violated the federal conflict of interest law, a criminal statute. The complaint states: "If Mr. Liddell personally participated in meetings with companies in which he held significant amounts of stock, he may have violated these rules." The White House responded with this statement: "Mr. Liddell has been working with the Office of the White House Counsel to ensure he is fully compliant with his legal and ethical obligations in connection with his holdings and his duties in the White House." Liddell was born in New Zealand and is a U.S. citizen. In the past he has worked as chief financial officer of Ford Motors, International Paper and Microsoft. It's not clear whether Liddell now has sold off his investments, but he apparently had not done so before the meetings in question. The meetings were held on Jan. 23, Jan. 24 and Feb. 3. On Feb. 9, the Office of Government Ethics issued four certificates of divestiture for Liddell and his wife. They would be worthless if the assets had already been sold. The complaint is one of several actions by CREW on White House ethics issues. The group says in a lawsuit that Trump is violating the Constitution's ban on foreign emoluments (gifts); it has questioned the ethics of presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway after she urged TV viewers to buy Ivanka Trump's fashion merchandise; and it challenged the lack of transparency of two White House advisory committees. CREW Director Noah Bookbinder said of the White House, "It seems nobody is concerned about people making decisions based on their personal interests and not the interests of the American people."

By Dominic Gates, The Seattle Times SEATTLE — The trade group representing the nation’s largest aerospace and defense companies is throwing its full weight behind a sweeping Republican plan that would transform the U.S. tax system, lowering the corporate tax rate while imposing new taxes on imported goods. In a letter Tuesday to congressional leaders, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg, who is chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association, or AIA, this year, expressed the group’s strong support for measures it described as “comprehensive reforms of our tax code.” That puts all 330 companies in the aerospace lobbying group firmly on the side of what’s called the border adjustment tax, which they say will stimulate U.S. manufacturing jobs. The tax-system reform package is hugely controversial and opposed in particular by large retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target, which say it will cause steep price increases for consumers. Muilenburg — along with the CEOs of other major corporations including GE, Caterpillar, United Technologies, Raytheon, Oracle and Merck — had already last month joined the American Made Coalition that is lobbying for the change. AIA Chief Executive David Melcher described the current U.S. tax system as “broken” and not globally competitive. “We need a modern tax system which creates a level playing field with the rest of the world in order to locate and grow jobs, manufacturing and profits inside the United States,” Melcher said. The plan proposed by House Speaker Paul Ryan and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Kevin Brady, represents a structural shift from taxing bottom-line corporate profits to taxing companies through their cash flow. If the Ryan plan becomes law, every time an item is sold in the U.S., the sales revenue would be taxable at 20 percent, with deductions allowed for labor and inventory costs. Another boost to business is that capital investment — such as the billions of dollars Boeing invests in its assembly plants — would be immediately deductible in the year the money is spent, instead of being accounted for through depreciation over many years. The most controversial piece of the proposal is the “border adjustment” element, which would exempt U.S. exports from the tax entirely, while imports would be taxed at 20 percent. President Donald Trump was initially cool to the plan but recently seems to have come around to the idea. “I certainly support a form of tax on the border, because everybody else does,” Trump told Reuters last month. Bloomberg News reported that top Trump strategist Steve Bannon is an enthusiastic backer, citing a person familiar with discussions between Bannon and Ryan. A company like Boeing, a huge net exporter, is likely to come out well ahead. The impact on other companies will vary according to how much they import. How other countries might react to the tax on imports is uncertain. Proponents of the new system insist it won’t distort the trade balance. But some experts are skeptical and believe U.S. trading partners, including perhaps China, could impose retaliatory tariffs — potentially even triggering a destructive trade war. Nonetheless, the AIA leadership, in its letter, urges Congress “to act now.”   Most Read Standoff between woman, Everett police ends peacefully EVERETT — A nearly six-hour-long SWAT standoff ended peacefully Wednesday evening on… Mar 16th, 2017 by Herald Staff Intestinal illnesses linked to Marysville trampoline park MARYSVILLE — The Snohomish Health District is looking into reports of a… Mar 16th, 2017 by Kari Bray Cocoon House raises $8 million for new building EVERETT — Cocoon House, a nonprofit that serves homeless youth, is now… Mar 15th, 2017 by Chris Winters Tree house turned into bed and breakfast near Woodinville WOODINVILLE — Tree houses are growing up.

Should You Actually Try It? Fast Food Packaging: Are Chemicals Leaking into Your Food? Historic NYC Pub McSorley's Shut Down by Department of Health How to Stock a Healthy Pantry Drinking Lots of Water Prevents Kids from Eating Junk Food Genetics Could Be To Blame for Your Salt Cravings By Beth Kowitt Posted March 14, 2017 Packaged convenience foods are getting healthier, maybe. For years Big Food lured consumers to its processed and packaged products with an irresistible combination of sugar, fat, and salt. Now it seems at least some of those consumer packaged giants are reversing course. A new study released by the Consumer Goods Forum found that the 102 companies it surveyed ranging from Walmart to Nestle reformulated more than 180,000 of their products to “support healthier diets and lifestyles and address public health priorities.” That’s an increase from just 84,000 products in 2015 and 22,500 in 2014. The number one ingredient the companies—representing some $1.8 trillion in 2015 revenue—were looking to remove was sugar. Sodium came in second, followed by trans fats and saturated fats. Whole grains and vitamins were the top two elements companies added to recipes. Sugar has long been on its way to becoming public enemy No. 1. Research firm NPD Group has found that sugar is the main substance that consumers are now trying to eliminate from their diets. As David Turner, a global food and drink analyst at market research firm Mintel, recently told Fortune, “Sugar is the new tobacco” in the minds of the public. (For more, read “The Hunt for the Perfect Sugar.”) Despite the reduction that the survey indicates, sugar is still pervasive in packaged foods and beverages. Some 74% of them contain some form of the sweetener, according to a recent study in The Lancet. Robert Lustig, a professor at the University of California at San Francisco’s School of Medicine and a leading critical voice on the topic, explained that companies “use hedonic substances, and sugar is the most ubiquitous hedonic substance.” The problem for Big Food companies is that the alternatives they have long turned to—artificial sweeteners—are also becoming unpalatable to their customers. According to Mintel, 39% of consumers think it’s best to avoid products containing artificial ingredients like aspartame and saccharin because of perceptions of health risks. Sales of such substitutes fell 13% between 2011 and 2016. That’s led to rush to find the perfect substitute to sugar—one that’s natural, zero-calorie, and tastes just like the real stuff. Nestle, for example, is trying to change sugar’s structure by essentially hollowing it out. As I wrote last month: Stefan Catsicas, the company’s head of innovation, describes a sugar crystal as being like a box. We taste only the outside of it in our mouths, but we swallow the contents of the entire thing even though the sugar on the inside is not essential to the sense in our mouth. “We can structure it so whatever we put on the tongue will be perceived and will represent most of what we swallow,” Catsicas says. This could potentially cut down on sugar by up to 40%. The problem is that the structure is destroyed in water, which is present in most foods. Luckily for Nestlé, chocolate is one of the only foods that are not aqueous. Meanwhile, a cottage industry of startups has developed to try to solve the sugar problem, either by searching for the perfect natural substitute or messing with our taste receptors.

Evan Vucci/AP Federal records indicate that a key adviser to President Trump held substantial investments in 18 companies when he joined Trump in meetings with their CEOs. The investments of Christopher Liddell, the president's director of strategic initiatives, totaled between $3 million and $4 million. Among the companies in Liddell's portfolio, and whose CEOs were in the meetings: Dell Technologies, Dow Chemical, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, Lockheed Martin and Wal-Mart. When Trump conferred with the chiefs of Ford, General Motors and Fiat-Chrysler last month, Liddell attended the session. He was invested in all three companies at the time. Politics Trump Ethics Monitor: Has The President Kept His Promises? Details of Liddell's investments are contained in documents he filed with the White House ethics officer in preparation for divesting his holdings. He was seeking certificates of divestiture, which allow federal appointees to defer paying capital-gains taxes by reinvesting in a blind trust or similar arrangement. The watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a complaint Tuesday with White House Counsel Donald McGahn, raising concerns that Liddell may have violated the federal conflict of interest law, a criminal statute. The complaint states: "If Mr. Liddell personally participated in meetings with companies in which he held significant amounts of stock, he may have violated these rules." The White House responded with this statement: "Mr. Liddell has been working with the Office of the White House Counsel to ensure he is fully compliant with his legal and ethical obligations in connection with his holdings and his duties in the White House." Liddell was born in New Zealand and is a U.S. citizen. In the past he has worked as chief financial officer of Ford Motors, International Paper and Microsoft. It's not clear whether Liddell now has sold off his investments, but he apparently had not done so before the meetings in question. The meetings were held on Jan. 23, Jan. 24 and Feb. 3. On Feb. 9, the Office of Government Ethics issued four certificates of divestiture for Liddell and his wife. They would be worthless if the assets had already been sold. The complaint is one of several actions by CREW on White House ethics issues. The group says in a lawsuit that Trump is violating the Constitution's ban on foreign emoluments (gifts); it has questioned the ethics of presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway after she urged TV viewers to buy Ivanka Trump's fashion merchandise; and it challenged the lack of transparency of two White House advisory committees. CREW Director Noah Bookbinder said of the White House, "It seems nobody is concerned about people making decisions based on their personal interests and not the interests of the American people."

Vibrator users will receive $10,000 each after company tracked their sexual activity Which lightbulb should you buy? Think in lumens Warren Buffett is worth more than $70 billion, but he often doesn’t act like it — and neither do many other affluent Americans. The documentary “Becoming Warren Buffett” that aired recently on HBO shows Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, eating breakfast each day at McDonald’s. Each morning, he asks his wife to set out $2.61, $2.95 or $3.17, which determines which breakfast he gets. “When I’m not feeling quite so prosperous, I might go with the $2.61, which is two sausage patties, and then I put them together and pour myself a Coke,” he says in the film. He also still lives in the five-bedroom home he bought for just over $30,000 in 1958 in Omaha. He’s not the only rich person behaving like this: “Rich people don’t get rich by spending it all,” says Pam Danziger, a researcher focused on the affluent market and founder of Unity Marketing, which helps brands better connect with affluent consumers. “They know better than anyone that by being careful shoppers, they can achieve a lifestyle several rungs up the income ladder.” There are myriad reasons that many affluent people are, well, cheap. Some of them are self-made and have spent many years before they were rich being thrifty. “Thriftiness is habit-forming,” says Scott Tucker, president and founder of financial firm Scott Tucker Solutions in Chicago. Others fear that their wealth isn’t permanent, so they don’t spend a lot of their money. This is particularly true of the top 10 percent of the income spectrum, according to the 2015 Survey of Affluence and Wealth by research and polling firm YouGov. “The resourcefulness, financial independence and spending constraints that arose from the fear of the recession are now enduring attitudes of family financial management,” the study authors write. During the recession, like many Americans, “fear drove them to step up their savings, cut spending, and retool their household budgets, and to become more resourceful and independent when evaluating and making significant purchases. Over time, panic has given way to confidently applying these practices to their purchasing habits.” Of course, rich people spend a ton. In 2015 alone, the affluent upped their spending by 6.6 percent on luxury goods — largely driven by increased spending on travel, dining out, home entertainment and cars, YouGov found. Still, many of them are very thrifty. Here are five stats that prove this: They tool around town in a Ford Sure, there are plenty of loaded Americans driving BMWs, but many drive far more modest cars. Data released in August 2016 by car site Edmunds.com found that the most popular car among those with incomes above $250,000 a year was the Ford F-Series, followed by the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Jeep Wranger; the Lexus RX and BMW X5 were only Nos. 4 and 5 on the list. “There will always be an interest in and market for high-end exotic vehicles,” says Edmunds.com executive director of industry analysis Jessica Caldwell. “But, overall, most of the wealthiest Americans look for their vehicles to perform the same kind of functional tasks that everyone else does.” Other studies show a similar penchant for modest cars among the wealthy: Among the top 10 most popular vehicles in America’s wealthiest neighborhoods, half are non-luxury vehicles, an analysis of car-buying habits of residents of the 10 wealthiest zip codes in America by TrueCar.com found. These include the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Honda CR-V, Volkswagen Jetta and Toyota Prius. You’ll find them in the aisles of Wal-Mart … One in three people with a net worth of more than $5 million say they shop at Wal-Mart, according to a survey of 1,200 ultra-high-net-worth investors released in 2014 by financial information site Millionaire Corner. What’s more, nearly half say they shop at Costco, and more than four in 10 at Target. More On: savings Save six figures over your lifetime by making your own latte How to win the game and retire in your 30s Most Americans plan on saving their tax refund Saving for retirement isn't all it's cracked up to be … And dropping coin at the dollar store Many dollar store shoppers make $100,000 a year or more, data released by research firm NPD Group in July found. “Considering that nearly one in five dollars spent there is contributed by the affluent, dollar stores’ value proposition clearly resonates across economic segments,” says Andy Mantis, executive vice president of Checkout Tracking, a division of NPD. The average wealthy dollar store shopper makes about one trip a month to those stores, the data showed (though, to be fair, lower-income people do make more frequent trips). They clip a lot of coupons Millionaire actress Kristen Bell says she’s an avid couponer. Her favorite: the Bed Bath and Beyond coupon. And she’s not the only rich person to do so. People making over $100,000 were actually more likely than those making less to use coupons, a survey of more than 8,000 shoppers released in 2010 by deal site Deals.com found. What’s more, one in four people who often use six or more coupons during each shopping trip were affluent, reporting incomes of $75,000 or more, according to research released in 2011 by the University of Arizona’s John Davis Norton School of Family and Consumer Sciences. They’re known as “coupon divas” by the researchers. “They don’t use coupons because of financial constraints but because they perceive coupons as saving them money,” said Anita Bhappu, an associate professor at the University of Arizona. They give a lower percentage of their income to charity than do other groups “The rich aren’t the most generous,” concludes a study published in the Chronicle of Philanthropy. “Middle-class Amer­i­cans give a far bigger share of their discretionary income to charities than the rich.” The data, which looked at IRS records, found that while households earning $50,000 to $75,000 give an average of 7.6 percent of their discretionary income to charity, households making $100,000 or more give an average of 4.2 percent.

According to the Bartlesville Police, an elderly woman inside the store discovered that her purse was missing. She then reportedly confronted a young woman in the store who she suspected had taken her purse. The young woman ran outside and got into the passenger side of a red Pontiac Vibe. She was later identified as a 14 year old female. The case has been turned over to Office of Juvenile affairs and the District Attorneys Office. Because it was a misdemeanor offense she was not arrested for the purse snatching. However, Bartlesville Police Department Public Information Officer, Jay Hastings, says she was arrested on a non-related offense of Domestic Abuse which had taken place over the weekend. Hastings says there may  be other pending charges from other reports taken recently.   « Back to News KWON Cooking Extravaganza Advertising Opportunities Contest Rules About Us Make Us Your Home Page Employment Opportunities Terms of Use Privacy Contact Us 2017 © KCD Enterprises.

(March 14, 2017) Related Coverage Trump lays out tougher approach to illegal immigration Legal challenges to Trump’s travel ban mount from US states KALAMAZOO, Mich. (WOOD) — A Michigan organization is working to protect immigrants who fear deportation by housing them in churches. Michigan United has partnered with a dozen or so Calhoun and Kalamazoo County churches — some in secret — that have agreed to act as safe havens for people concerned they may be at risk of deportation. “We’re here today to say with a united voice that we stand with the immigrant and refugee families here in Kalamazoo,” Pastor Nathan Dannison said Tuesday at a press conference at First Congregational Church in downtown Kalamazoo. Organizers of the so-called “resistance” effort handed out a 2011 memo in which U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it would not perform planned operations or arrests at churches or other sensitive sites barring extraordinary circumstances. Leaders told stories of undocumented immigrants who are afraid to go outside, afraid their families will be torn apart because of President Donald Trump’s stricter stance on immigration. “They won’t even go to Wal-Mart. They’re just terrified to go to the store,” Milwood United Methodist Church Pastor Kim Clark said. But is the fear of ICE coming to people’s homes justified? “I have heard that it has happened in Michigan. I have not particularly heard that it has happened in Kalamazoo,” Michigan United volunteer Nelly Fuentes said. “ICE is in Kalamazoo regularly picking up people with warrants. I have not heard anything about massive raids.” And while Pastor Clark said he had heard anecdotes of ICE arrests, he said he didn’t know any families that had experienced one. Regardless, Fuentes said the Trump administration has increased “hatred against people who are brown.” “We just keep getting pounded and pounded with this administration,” she added. She said immigrants come to the U.S. fleeing terrible conditions. “People are leaving their homes because they absolutely have to. They must otherwise they will perish,” she said. “I am grateful that this (the sanctuary church effort) is here but it should not be needed.” Michigan United is a statewide group that advocates for immigration reform, among other things. It says it will help anyone from the West Michigan area and hopes to get some grand Rapids-area churches on board. It is also organizing similar efforts in other cities, including Detroit. Those looking to benefit from the sanctuary churches can contact Michigan United online.

Separately the DJIA closed down 0.20% on the day at 20,840.25, down approximately 41.23 points. The overall drop in the markets was brought about by oil and gas stocks, as crude oil continues to drop further below the $50 mark. We also saw industrial goods drop off and major airlines continued to fall from Monday. Not too much was positive in the market industry-wise besides textiles but a few big winners on the day were Wal-Mart and Nike. Crude oil continued its journey down, closing 1.1% lower at $47.86. Gold fell slightly below the $1,200 level. On the day it fell 0.4% or $5.20, closing at $1,197.90. As we have said before, the oil and gas companies helped pull the S&P down along with industrial goods and major airlines. It would appear that the price of crude dropping would be a common denominator across these industries. Textiles was the only industry that was positive across the board. Nike, with its apparel business, spearheaded the industry after recent analyst reports were very bullish on the stock and industry as a whole. The S&P 500 stock posting the largest daily percentage loss ahead of the close Tuesday was United Continental Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: UAL) which traded down 4.7% at $66.59. The stock’s 52-week range is $37.41 to $76.80. Volume was 7.2 million versus the daily average of 3.3 million shares. The stock posting the largest daily percentage gain in the S&P 500 ahead of the close Tuesday was The Western Union Co. (NYSE: WU) which jumped 3.6% to $20.28. The stock’s 52-week range is $18.07 to $22.70. Volume was 11 million which is well above the daily average of around 5.8 million shares.

Want uninterrupted access to TheMercury.com on your computer, smartphone and tablet? We have many subscription options to fit your needs. See my options Riley County police are investigating the use of so-called “skimmers” at two area gas stations. RCPD spokesman Alexander Robinson said the devices, which read the magnetic strip on a debit or credit card when customers insert their card to pay for gas at a pump, were found last week at two Shop Quik locations — 529 Richards Drive and 430 Fort Riley Blvd. The thief responsible is apparently using the stolen card information, rather than selling it in bulk. “It seems like they are using it and paying for stuff online at Walmart, which is generally not what you would see if they were sold in bulk,” Robinson said. Because the devices are installed inside the pump, there is no way for customers to know a skimmer is present. Getting inside of the pump requires the criminal to have a key, pick the lock, force it open, or take advantage of a pump left unlocked. “We won’t be able to find out for sure until we catch the people and have a chat with them,” Robinson said. Robinson said gas pumps are the only target. “Anything where you are using a debit or credit card is susceptible to skimming or some type of electronic hacking where they can get your information,” he said. RCPD doesn’t know how many cards were potentially affected. “We don’t know how long they were there for,” he said. “They could have been installed that morning and were found four hours later or they could have been there a while.” Robinson recommends people regularly check their financial statements and make sure there is no fraudulent activity. If a person suspects fraudulent activity, Robinson said to call Riley County dispatch at 785-537-2112 to report it.

(Karrierebibel.de) A heavily lobbied measure intended to knock down a decades-old prohibition on selling liquor in grocery and large retail stores narrowly continued to advance in the House on Tuesday. The Government Operations & Technology Appropriations Subcommittee voted 7-6 to support an amended proposal (HB 81) that would end a Depression-era law requiring liquor stores and bars to be separated from groceries and other retail goods, an issue commonly referred to as the “liquor wall.” The contentious bill — sought by Wal-Mart and Target and opposed by Publix and ABC Fine Wine & Spirits — needs to make it through one more committee in the House and awaits a floor vote in the Senate (SB 106). House sponsor Bryan Avila, R-Hialeah, rejected claims by opponents that his legislation, three years in the making, will increase access to liquor by minors and harm existing businesses. “While shopping at Publix is a pleasure, certainly their argument is not,” Avila said. “The only reason the antiquated law is being opposed is to maintain the status quo.” Before the vote, Avila proposed an amendment that would sort alcohol licenses into two categories, one for businesses that seek to remain stand-alone for liquor, the other imposing fees — based on county population — for those that want to sell liquor in the same stores as other goods. Avila said he’s also considering additional changes for when the proposal goes to the Commerce Committee. That could include requiring cashiers to be 18 or older when liquor is purchased and increasing penalties on businesses that are found selling to minors. He also indicated he is open to proposals in the Senate bill that would require small bottles, 6.8 ounces or less, to be displayed only behind the counter and phasing in the law over a four-year period. Still, the House bill, which appeared to stall a week ago, remains controversial for many. “The losers are clearly going to be the small businesses,” said Rep. Kathleen Peters, a Treasure Island Republican who voted against the bill. Thomas Culligan, representing Publix, said in opposing the measure that the supermarket chain may be able to support a delayed implementation. Publix has opened stand-alone liquor stores in many shopping centers that also include grocery stores. “We’ve invested so much in the stores that we have built out in the state,” Culligan said. “We also have a number of leases that we’d like to see expire if this does happen.” Pat McClellan, owner of the Flora-Bama lounge and package store in the Panhandle, said the change would result in a greater ability for minors to get their hands on liquor and would lead to more impulse-buying of alcohol. “It ain’t right to put the apple schnapps next to the apple sauce,” McClellan said. Proponents contend abolishing the “outdated” law is necessary to provide more convenience to shoppers, reduce regulations and save money for businesses. Joseph Salzverg, a lobbyist for Target, said the change would allow the Minnesota-based company to meet customers’ needs and expectations. “The way Target structures their business model is a racetrack type of shopping,” Salzverg said. “That’s why we don’t currently operate bifurcated stores in the state of Florida.” –Jim Turner, News Service of Florida Recommend or share: Tweet Print More Email Share on Tumblr Questions?

Isn’t it hard enough for kids looking for work without the damage this will do because of age requirements? No doubt, a backroom with pallets of hooch will be of no interest to young stock clerks and others. Right Bryan? Reply Fred says: March 14, 2017 at 7:36 pm Just what America needs…More DRUNKS !!!!

Reply Larry Krasner says: March 15, 2017 at 8:56 am What I dislike about this proposed change is it will mean a significant loss in shoppers’ choices. They’re going to take out an aisle or two of groceries and replace them with booze. It will also drive up prices a bit because that’s what happens when they reduce buyer choices.

The group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, filed a complaint with the White House on Tuesday. CREW says Christopher Liddell, President Trump's director of strategic initiatives and a former top executive for General Motors, Microsoft, International Paper and William Morris Endeavor, may have broken a conflict-of-interest law. In the early weeks of the administration, Liddell attended meetings with Trump and executives from more than a dozen companies, the complaint says. At that time, Liddell appears to have held millions of dollars' worth of stock in many of those same companies, including GM, International Paper, Tesla Motors, Lockheed Martin, JPMorgan Chase, Pepsi and Walmart, the complaint says. CREW says it based its conclusion on what are known as certificates of divestiture, indicating that Liddell owned stock in hundreds of companies, including those whose executives were in the White House meetings. Those certificates would have allowed him to sell stock holdings identified as ethically problematic without having to pay steep capital gains taxes. Liddell would get the benefit so long as he reinvested his money in an investment allowed by the government, like a highly diversified mutual fund. The certificates were not issued until Feb. 9, six days after the last of the meetings. That "strongly indicates Mr. Liddell still held stock in the companies at that point and had not divested his financial interests in these assets prior to his participation in the meetings," CREW says. The ethics office did not immediately respond to a request from CNNMoney for the documents. A White House spokesperson said Liddell "has been working with the Office of the White House Counsel to ensure he is fully compliant with his legal and ethical obligations in connection with his holdings and his duties in the White House." The spokesperson did not address whether Liddell owned those specific stocks at the time he sat in the meetings, as the CREW complaint alleges. Federal code prohibits federal employees from participating personally in a particular matter in which, to their knowledge, they have a "financial interest." CREW wants the White House to confirm whether Liddell held stock in the companies, whether he sold the stocks or got a waiver before the meetings, and whether the Justice Department should investigate. CREW notes that it's not publicly known what was discussed at the meetings. But Trump has publicly indicated that he discussed policy matters and other regulations. "Will be meeting at 9:00 with top automobile executives concerning jobs in America," he tweeted about the Jan. 24 meeting with General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler.

The powerful nor'easter fell well short of forecasters' snow predictions in New York and Philadelphia but unloaded 1-2ft in places mostly inland, grounded more than 6,000 flights, and knocked out power to nearly a quarter of a million customers from Virginia northward. By the time it reached Massachusetts, it had turned into a blizzard, with near hurricane-force wind gusting over 70mph along the coast and waves crashing over the seawalls. Up to a foot of snow was expected in the Boston area. It was easily the biggest storm in a winter that had mostly spared the north-east. "It's horrible," said Don Zimmerman, of Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, using a snowblower to clear the pavement. "I thought winter was out of here. ... It's a real kick in the rear." While people mostly heeded dire warnings to stay home and off the roads, police said a 16-year-old girl was killed when she lost control of her car on a snowy road and hit a tree in Gilford, New Hampshire. The storm closed schools in cities big and small, Amtrak suspended services and the post office halted deliveries. Philadelphia and New York City escaped the brunt of the snow, getting just a few inches and not the foot or more forecasters had expected before the storm switched over mostly to sleet. In New Jersey, which saw rain or just a little snow in many areas, Governor Chris Christie called the storm an "underperformer". Inland areas, meanwhile, got hit hard. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Worcester, Massachusetts, received a foot or more of snow. The Binghamton, New York, area was hit with over 2ft, while Vernon, New Jersey, got at least 19 inches. The storm came just days after the region saw temperatures climb into the 60s, and less than a week before the official start of spring. February, too, was remarkably warm. In the nation's capital, non-essential federal employees were given the option of reporting three hours late, taking the day off or working from home. The city got less than 2 inches of snow. As the storm closed in, the National Weather Service used terms like "life-threatening" and urged people to "shelter in place," language that has come to be associated with mass shootings. In the end, the line between snow and rain shifted slightly to the west, sparing some of the Northeast's big cities. Government meteorologists realised by late Monday afternoon that there was a good chance the storm was not going to produce the giant big-city snow totals predicted. But they did not change their forecast for fear people would mistakenly think the storm was no longer dangerous, said Greg Carbin, chief of forecast operations at the Weather Prediction Centre.

None of the above home : local news : local news March 16, 2017 3/14/2017 3:46:00 PM Man charged for filching pills at Walmart PETE WILSON Editor A Jackson area man faces two charges after he allegedly stole prescription pills from an unattended cart at the Jackson Walmart store last Saturday afternoon, March 11. Jackson Police report that Matthew A. Floyd, 36, of Jisco West Road, Jackson, faces charges of Theft Of Drugs and Possession Of Drugs as a result of the incident. Police say the store's video surveillance system was instrumental in leading to his identification and arrest, which occurred just two hours after the theft. Police were notified at 12:30 p.m. Saturday that Thomas Pratt of Chillicothe Street, Jackson, had reported the theft of prescription drugs which he had just purchased at the Walmart pharmacy. Pratt had left a bag containing his newly purchased prescription medication in a motorized cart in the store's breezeway, then departed from the store. When Pratt realized he had left behind his medicine and went back to the cart, he found the bag was no longer there. When he went to the pharmacy department to see if the bag had turned in, he was relieved to see it had been turned in, but he then discovered that one of the bottles of pills was missing from the bag. Police and store personnel immediately checked surveillance videotape, which showed a male taking the bag from the unattended motorized cart, then going to his parked vehicle in the parking lot. He then returned to the store with the bag and turned it into the pharmacy department, allegedly minus one bottle of pills. Police, however, were able to make a tentative identification from the surveillance videotape and the search was on for Floyd. At 2:38 p.m. that same afternoon, officers on patrol were able to locate Floyd driving his vehicle on East Street in Jackson and conducted a traffic stop. After a canine alerted on the vehicle, a search was conducted and officers found a bottle of prescription pills with Thomas Pratt's name on it. The prescription was for 90 pills, but there was only 25 pills remaining in the bottle.

Another traumatic effect of war, moral injury, is receiving more attention. David Wood is the senior military correspondent for The Huffington Post and a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who has covered conflict for more than 35 years throughout the Middle East, Africa, Russia and China. A self-described pacifist Quaker, Wood takes a humanistic approach to his work about war. His latest book "What Have We Done" explores this infrequently addressed burden our soldiers are bringing back from war. How can the average American understand the difference between PTSD and moral injury? If you have severe moral injury or PTSD, both of those can make you feel anxious, can make you lose sleep, can make you susceptible to eruptions of anger, irritability, that sort of thing. Mostly anxiety I think. But the causes are different. PTSD the way I understand it is a purely physical thing that happens when you’re faced with a life-threatening situation or big threat. Your body involuntarily reacts to that. It’s automatic, it kicks off and it helps you get through a crisis. The problem is when something kicks that off and you’re not in danger. So you’re at Walmart and something kicks off your fight-or-flight response and all of a sudden you’re sweating heavily, there’s adrenaline squirting into your bloodstream, you’ve got all this excess energy and it can be really profoundly disturbing to have that happen. Moral injury is a completely different thing where your sense of what’s right is violated, either by something that happens external to you, or something that you did or failed to do, or something that you saw. We all walk around with a pretty well developed sense of what’s right. It comes from what you learned growing up and it comes from military values on top of that. The big one is you’re responsible for your buddy no matter what ... Even if the sniper came out of nowhere, you can feel guilty at the time for not being able to protect your buddy. So that’s not right, that’s a hard thing to deal with. Those things can be difficult to absorb and reconcile with. You’ve done a lot of work exploring moral injury. When did you first learn of the concept and what struck you about it? In retrospect, thinking back I sort of noticed there were things that were happening during deployments that people felt bad about in some way. It wasn’t until I went back and started to re-interview people that I’d known when I was deployed and started seeking out other people, that I really started to zero in on this whole idea of moral injury. Because it’s kind of hard to see, and it’s not the kind of thing that people necessarily want to talk about. What recent executive orders mean for Texas’ military community Do you feel moral injury was more difficult for soldiers to discuss than PTSD? Some people are okay talking about anything and some people are more private, so I don’t think I can generalize there. One thing I noticed early on was that this was not PTSD. I’d done a big project on the physically wounded of Iraq and Afghanistan, and then that sort of got me interested in mental wounds. So I did a lot of stories on traumatic brain injury, and so after I got that done I said, well I still don’t understand this because it seems to me that most of the people I know don’t have PTSD, it’s something different. The work of Jonathan Shay, a VA psychiatrist who worked in Boston for decades with Vietnam veterans, sort of coined the phrase moral injury and really he is a father of modern understanding of moral injury. I’d known him for a long time and I’d read his books, but I went back to reread them and I thought “A-ha! This is what we’re talking about.” Soldiers with 2nd Platoon, A Company 1-30 Infantry, 1st Brigade Combat Team 3rd Infantry Division of the U.S. Army, from Fort Benning, Georgia, are the first to set foot in Iraq as they search an Iraqi borderpost that was hit with artillery just hours before, as U.S. ground forces moved across the border from Kuwait, Thursday evening March 20, 2003.  KRT; DAVID P. GILKEY/DETROIT FREE PRESS  Do you feel like you experienced moral injury during your time in war zones? How do you connect to it? Thinking back on my experiences ... I think that I’ve experienced a tiny bit of moral injury. It’s important and only interesting because it allowed me to gain understanding of the severe moral injury that other people can go through. I don’t put my experience up against people who’ve deployed as combatants. But I’ve had a couple experiences that were just enough to make me think, Oh yeah, something happened to me that I didn’t feel too good about when it was over. I think all of us have had moments where ... we later thought I’m not terribly proud of that. And that’s a small moral injury. There’s a tremendous realm of severity. A lot of moral injury that’s experienced in wartime is transitory and certainly not disabling. What is being done right now to help troops with moral injury, and is it enough? There are people in the department of Veterans Affairs who recognized moral injury way before me and set about trying to deal with it. My sense is that there are plenty of people with moral injury who feel perfectly well-adjusted and that they don’t need help, and that’s fine. I certainly don’t think that everyone who’s experienced moral injury has to take therapy or pills or anything of that sort. But there are some people that feel so morally injured that it drives them to their knees. It’s disabling. Why can't Americans muster much empathy for Muslim victims of terrorism? It can be difficult for a combat veteran to talk openly about what happened because of what people might think. So I think for people who are bothered by their moral injury, being in an environment where you can talk about what happened, about what’s bothering you and have people accept that ... there can be a sense of acceptance in that for the veteran. Ancient societies and even some cultures today have formal ceremonies of cleansing and forgiveness for their returning warriors. There are Native American groups where the women would paint warriors when they went off to battle. And then when they came back there would be a ceremonial washing off of the warpaint as a way of acknowledging that they may have done some things that are hard, but they’re still loved and welcome at home. We don’t have anything like that in our culture. It’s now been 14 years since the Iraq invasion, how would you like for civilians to look at an anniversary like this one? Try to envision the enormous human capital that’s gone into fighting that war and others. The enormous sacrifice that those people made and are still making in ways that are very difficult to see like moral injury. There’s a lot civilians can do. One of the reasons I wrote this book was to encourage civilians who know nothing about the military and have no connection to it to recognize that there is a burden that falls on the men and women we send to war, and they carry that around with them. So if there are ways that people can find to meet veterans and say: “I didn’t go, I chose not go, so I can never really understand what it was like, but I’d to try to understand a little bit and if you can try to talk about it I’d like to listen.” And then listen with validation, which just means accepting what the person is telling you and not trying to dismiss it. Just acknowledging, “Yeah that sounds kind of painful.” Reports indicate President Donald Trump may deploy more troops in the Middle East in the future. Is that a positive move in a war that’s been going on this long? We’ve got active wars going on in Syria, Yemen, in Iraq and Afghanistan among many other places, but those are big hot ones. I think we know deep down that you don’t win those wars by dropping explosives on people. You gotta have people go in and hold ground. So I thought for a long time it’s inevitable, we’re gonna start sending American ground forces into Syria -- which we’ve done -- send them back into Afghanistan -- which we’ve done -- send them back into Iraq -- which we’ve done. So I’m not surprised by this kind of thing, but I’m always a little bit bothered by how easily that happens. How almost invisible and painless it is. So we’re sending more marines back into Afghanistan... a lot of marines got killed there. It’s a dangerous place. And it happened without any discussion or without much notice. I’m sorry, this is a huge deal. People volunteered to put their lives on the line for their country and it hardly even causes a ripple. It does bother me that these decisions are made basically without any of us in the civilian world being aware of it. I think we’ve gotten so blasé about sending people off to war that we hardly even think about it. And I think that gives political leaders the leeway to do it. Could that effect intensify if we continue these wars? Yes, unless people make a fuss and say maybe we agree that we send Marines, but you need to come to us to ask, at least go to Congress. They’re the ones that have the war-making power under the Constitution. The public’s not paying attention, and we all sort of shrug when we send more people off to war. How would you feel if you went off to war and nobody noticed? There’s another moral injury right there before they even get off the plane in Kabul or wherever they’re flying to.

Image Credit: Nintendo We are coming off a major console launch, and an event like that can significantly affect the business of selling games. And retailers that are prepared for it can take advantage of that to boost its web traffic and its sales, and that’s exactly what happened with the Nintendo Switch. Every major retailer in the United States saw an increase in their web and mobile traffic from Nintendo’s site and from searches for the Switch, according to analytics firm SimilarWeb. GameStop and Toys ‘R’ Us traffic peaked over a 30-day period on the Nintendo Switch’s March 3 launch day. Nintendo.com also sent a surge of clicks to GameStop, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — but Amazon and Toys ‘R’ Us saw the biggest increases compared to January 2017. Most of this data isn’t surprising, but it does highlight the importance of a console launch to both the online and brick-and-mortar retail space. Over the month leading into the launch of the Switch, Nintendo’s website sent 1.4 million clicks through to Amazon. That outpaced every other retailer. Toys R Us received the lead amount of hits from Nintendo.com, but it also had the largest spike in traffic from the publisher’s website with an increase of 813 percent compared to January. Above: Nintendo Switch launch data. Image Credit: Nintendo When it came to search, GameStop showed its market dominance. It owned more than 3 percent of the clicks for the term “Switch” in the month leading up to the launch of the system. But Target, Best Buy, Toys R Us, and Walmart also all saw an increase in traffic during that period after barely getting a quarter of the traffic from that term in January.

Image Credit: SimilarWeb Finally, traffic patterns to Nintendo’s website reveal when gaming fans are more likely to take action. Above: Traffic patterns for Nintendo.com. Image Credit: SimilarWeb March 3 was a big day for hits to Nintendo.com, but it was well behind the deluge of clicks that happened on January 13 when the company revealed the Switch during a live video presentation. And no day over the last year led to more traffic for Nintendo.com than the launch of the Miitomo smartphone app on March 31, 2016. That game debuted alongside the new My Nintendo account, which required fans to get on the company’s website to sign up. Miitomo and My Nintendo account signups led to 1.7 million visitors whereas the Switch launch day had just around 1 million.

So if this week’s edition ends up not sitting well with you, please send the hate mail, the bomb, etc. their way. Thanks for understanding. And thanks for all the fish … I am not what you call fluent in fashion. My style is that I don’t really have any style. However, I am observant, and I’ve noticed that true nerds have a consistent dress code. While there is a range in … “upscaleness” (is that even a word?) in attire from nerd to nerd, there are a few common, basic building blocks. Take shirts, for example. Shirts are an essential weapon in the nerd wardrobe arsenal. A shirt doesn’t just give a nerd some style — it can even signal to other nerds that the wearer is part of the club. This is especially true shirts that are less common and mass-produced than the ones you can get for $7.50 at Walmart. And all the while, the right shirt really reflects the feelings the wearer has for favorite fandoms. Yes, the right shirt is truly a Swiss Army knife-like fusion of function, feeling and fashion. And I believe there are five basic types of shirt that all well-dressed nerds should have in their closet … The graphic tee This is the nerd’s fashion bread and butter. Emblazoned with logos and depiction of your favorite pop culture characters or properties, the graphic tee can be in instant identifier to like-minded people that you know what’s up. For example, let’s say I wear my Babymetal tee out to Best Buy or the zoo or someplace like that. Ninety percent of people will have no idea what Babymetal is and no desire to learn. But the people that know will give me a thumbs up or a knowing nod. They may approach me and have an instant opening line: “Nice shirt, homie.” And if I see a beautiful woman who’s also wearing Babymetal gear? Well, I would be too scared to approach her, but I DEFINITELY would spend a lot of time beating myself up for not talking to a gorgeous female who may actually share a common interest with me. Sometimes you have to take what life gives you. The long-sleeved button-down Hard to believe, but there may come a day where you may not feel like wearing Green Lantern or Chewbacca on your chest. Or maybe you may need to look more presentable. Or perhaps you may just want to wear something with a little more to offer in the sleeves department. That’s why having at least two or three long-sleeved button-downs in your closet. Solid colors and plaid flannels are my personal favorites, but there are plenty of other options. The floral print Hawaiian shirt Because if they’re good enough for Wash of “Firefly,” they’re good enough for any nerd. The sports jersey with nerdy stuff on it The battle between jocks and nerds still rages today, and most of the time, jocks have most of the ammunition. But you can strike at a jock’s heart by wearing a football or baseball jersey defaced and desecrated with nerdy logos and images. Wear your Team Gryffindor hockey jersey to your jock brother-in-law’s house and watch the pain well up in his face. Or maybe just wear them because they look cool. The sweater Sweaters, cardigans and sweater vests are essential nerd attire. Not only do they keep skinny nerds warm at social gatherings held in drafty rooms, they also don’t stand out or draw too much attention, allowing you to blend into the background of a party or family gathering. Unless, of course, we’re talking ugly sweaters. Then all bets are off. I prefer my sweaters of the hooded sweatshirt variety. They’re super comfy, and since most of them are splattered with “Star Wars” graphics or Marvel Comics characters, they serve some of the same purposes that my graphic tees. If I REALLY want to show my “Star Wars” love, I can wear my Boba Fett hoodie over my “Return of the Jedi” T-shirt. Hey, this was kind of fun. Maybe I should do headgear next … NEVER MISS A STORY!

I’m writing to inform you that we do, and to educate our residents on the truths about homelessness. We believe in Auburn and love it, so we have to believe in our ability to serve ANY one in Auburn. Have you ever heard the term “a team is only as good as it’s weakest member”? That one family that sleeps in their car in the Wal-Mart parking lot every night represents our city just as much as the President of our University does. Do you know where individuals whom are homeless in our area sleep? They sleep in abandoned buildings, cars in parking lots, in and out of cheap, unsanitary hotels and under bridges. Have you seen them in these locations?  If so, this would be a good time to mention that. I have met people coming through local help resources that tell me they sleep in their cars at night. Let’s get some facts straight about why people become homeless. No, it’s not just individuals who do not want to work. Homeless individuals are people such as youth who age out of the foster care system, single mothers or fathers who lost a spouse that are now living off of one income, elderly who barely receive enough per month to live, or even individuals with a disability. You may be thinking, “what about all that government assistance” and “why can’t they just get a job and use their money the way they are supposed to” (both questions I hear frequently). The truth lies in these statistics: according to livingwage.mit.edu, the wage needed to live, not be comfortable, is $10.17 per/hour for one adult. Minimum wage in Alabama is still $7.25 per/hour. So no, you cannot expect that the mother, father, older adult, young adult or teen taking your order at a fast food restaurant is making even close to enough to find a bed that night. Our system in Alabama is designed to keep individuals whom are homeless where they are. By the way, two highly talked about government assistance funds: food stamps and TANF are also not enough to feed and help families in need. TANF is Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. According to The Kaiser Family Foundation, the average monthly assistance through food stamps (SNAP) in Alabama is only about $125.73 per person. I am what is considered a poor college student and that is barely enough to help me through the month. I want to also be clear that programs such as TANF have strict requirements. TANF is time limited – only allowed for 48 months. According to TANF.us, you must work or take part in work activity for 30 hours per week. That means recipients MUST attend school, work or look for jobs actively for 30 hours per week. This is not free money. To wrap this up, I suggest a solution to help homeless individuals in the Auburn/Opelika area. The city governments have both denied the production of a homeless shelter in our local cities. I want to advocate for city funding to be used to build and maintain a homeless shelter in the Auburn/Opelika area. Let us provide care for people in need of our love, rather than ignore the problems they face. Julie Spear is a concerned Auburn citizen who has a passion to bring awareness of the reality of homelessness in the area.

In a letter Tuesday to congressional leaders, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg, who is chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association, or AIA, this year, expressed the group’s strong support for measures it described as “comprehensive reforms of our tax code.” That puts all 330 companies in the aerospace lobbying group firmly on the side of what’s called the border adjustment tax, which they say will stimulate U.S. manufacturing jobs. The tax-system reform package is hugely controversial and opposed in particular by large retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target, which say it will cause steep price increases for consumers. Advertisement Continue reading Muilenburg — along with the CEOs of other major corporations including GE, Caterpillar, United Technologies, Raytheon, Oracle and Merck — had already last month joined the American Made Coalition that is lobbying for the change. In a separate statement, AIA Chief Executive David Melcher described the current U.S. tax system as “broken” and not globally competitive. “We need a modern tax system which creates a level playing field with the rest of the world in order to locate and grow jobs, manufacturing and profits inside the United States,” Melcher said. The plan proposed by House Speaker Paul Ryan and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Kevin Brady, represents a structural shift from taxing bottom-line corporate profits to taxing companies through their cash flow. If the Ryan plan becomes law, every time an item is sold in the U.S., the sales revenue would be taxable at 20 percent, with deductions allowed for labor and inventory costs. Another boost to business is that capital investment — such as the billions of dollars Boeing invests in its assembly plants — would be immediately deductible in the year the money is spent, instead of being accounted for through depreciation over many years. The most controversial piece of the proposal is the “border adjustment” element, which would exempt U.S. exports from the tax entirely, while imports would be taxed at 20 percent. President Donald Trump was initially cool to the plan but recently seems to have come around to the idea. Advertisement Continue reading “I certainly support a form of tax on the border, because everybody else does,” Trump told Reuters last month. Bloomberg News reported that top Trump strategist Steve Bannon is an enthusiastic backer, citing a person familiar with discussions between Bannon and Ryan. A company like Boeing, a huge net exporter, is likely to come out well ahead. The impact on other companies will vary according to how much they import. How other countries might react to the tax on imports is uncertain. Proponents of the new system insist it won’t distort the trade balance. But some experts are skeptical and believe U.S. trading partners, including perhaps China, could impose retaliatory tariffs — potentially even triggering a destructive trade war. Nonetheless, the AIA leadership, in its letter, urges Congress “to act now.” —— ©2017 The Seattle Times Visit The Seattle Times at www.seattletimes.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. _____ Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe Most Recent Biz News Suggested Stories: States grovel before Boeing in bid for 777X jobs – Dec 5, 2013 Washington state pitches more help for Boeing – Jan 15, 2014 Military fuel tanker delays pull down Boeing's 2Q earnings – Jul 22, 2015 Boeing chief pledges to work with new administration after Trump threatened to kill Air Force One deal – Dec 7, 2016 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

Terrill Chatman, 48, pleaded guilty to one count of misappropriation of postal funds in November 2016. Chief U.S. District Judge Karon O. Bowdre sentenced Chatman to 12 months of probation. He was ordered to complete a financial literacy program during his probation, and barred from obtaining any new debts. According to court documents, Chatman was a postal worker when he stole two gift cards from the mail in 2015. The gift cards included a $50 Publix gift card and a $10 Walmart gift card from mailboxes at the Crowne at Grandview apartment complex, which was on his postal route. When police questioned Chatman about the missing gift cards, he denied taking them but told officers that he was experiencing financial trouble, documents showed. Chatman said he was divorced and had children to support, which made him financially strained. Records show he said, "Yes, I'm having financial problems." Police said when Chatman was arrested, he had several gift cards in his possession and numerous others in his vehicle. Chatman, of Birmingham, was an offensive lineman on the 1989 Alabama football team that finished with a 10-2 record and a share of the SEC Championship. He was one of nine Alabama players who received All-SEC honors that year. Must-see concerts in Alabama this year ...

Hot Topics: Box of ducklings Lafayette suicide Boulder trail graffiti Boulder Junction settlement Leanin' Tree Museum closing News tips Print   Email   Font Resize Boulder County judge to allow stalker Robert Vinyard to take supervised trips By Mitchell Byars Staff Writer Posted:   03/14/2017 12:03:43 PM MDT Updated:   03/14/2017 05:10:18 PM MDT Accused stalker Robert Vinyard sits in the jury box listening to testimony during his trail at the Boulder County Justice Center in August 2005. (File photo) A Boulder County judge will allow Robert Vinyard — found not guilty by reason of insanity in 2005 for stalking a Longmont woman since the 1970s — to take supervised trips away from the state hospital. Boulder District Judge Ingrid Bakke issued a written ruling Monday approving the trips, which staff at the Colorado Mental Health Institute in Pueblo say are needed to help Vinyard socialize and get over his obsession with the victim. "It is clear to the court that the defendant has declined in health, both mentally and physically, since his commitment," Bakke wrote. "Because of this decline in health, the court is convinced the transition to supervised off grounds privileges is a means of slowing this decline and perhaps affording him an opportunity to progress away from his fixation with the victim." Staff at the hospital said that out-of-hospital trips — which include outings such as trips to Walmart, disc golf and eating out at restaurants — are necessary should Vinyard ever be released. Advertisement Vinyard, 62, began stalking Peggy Anderson — who later changed her name to Kaia Anderson in an effort to distance herself from Vinyard — in 1979. The two met at the University of Colorado in 1977 and were never romantically involved, but officials say Vinyard has delusions they have a connection. He was arrested in 2003 for the stalking — which included cards, phone calls, letters and personal confrontations — and was committed in 2005. While a patient at the hospital, he continued to contact Anderson through letters and phone calls. Anderson and the Boulder County District Attorney's Office objected to the supervised trips during a hearing last week, saying that there was nothing to suggest he had gotten over his obsession of Anderson. "We respect the court's decision in this matter," Boulder Deputy District Attorney Tim Johnson said in a statement. "However, we have serious concerns about Mr. Vinyard being able to leave the hospital facility, even while supervised. While his physical health has deteriorated, he maintains a strong and unshakable obsession for the victim. I don't believe his supervision in the community will diminish this obsession." But Bakke said that at this point she felt the threat to Anderson "has diminished significantly." "It should be noted the defendant is housed in an area which is not secured, and yet he has never attempted to escape. It is the opinion of the defendant's treatment providers that he is not a safety risk to the community in general. Testimony indicated his primary motivation at this time in his life is to stay out of trouble and not lose the privileges he has obtained thus far." But Bakke did say the hospital needed to make sure it communicated with Anderson. "Ms. Anderson's complaints regarding a lack of recognition regarding the harm the defendant is able to impose on her and her family by any communication, as well as a lack of communication with her about the defendant and his status at the hospital has merit," Bakke wrote. "Hopefully better efforts will be made to work with her during this transition in privileges in order to assuage her fears and allow her to feel as though her input matters and will be considered as the defendant's treatment moves forward." In 2014, the state hospital briefly planned on allowing Vinyard to leave the hospital on short trips, but quickly retracted the idea, and Anderson testified that she lodged a complaint with the Colorado Department of Public Safety because she had not been notified of the 2014 plan. She said DPS found the hospital at fault, which sparked a process by which the hospital was brought into compliance with the Victims Rights Act. "It is the District Attorney's Office's hope that the state hospital will work closely with the victim to address her fears about him being in the community," Johnson said. "Efforts by the state hospital can go a long way to ensure the victim that Mr. Vinyard is being supervised and precautions are being made to address her safety concerns."

News Boeing Expanding In China As Aerospace Group Backs Tax Overhaul Boeing, a supporter of the House GOP border adjustment tax, is expanding its China manufacturing operations. (Boeing) GILLIAN RICH 3/14/2017 Reprints An aerospace industry group sent a letter to congress Friday backing Republican plans to overall the tax system as member and Dow Jones industrial average component Boeing (BA) will break ground on a new finishing plant in China by the end of the month. "We urge you to enact legislation that modernizes our tax system, allows America's businesses to better compete in the global marketplace and encourages job creation and innovation in the United States," the Aerospace Industries Association of America said in its letter to congress said according to Reuters. In a letter made public by the AIA, the group said the proposed House corporate tax reform blueprint would "benefit American businesses and American workers across the board." The blueprint would lower the corporate tax rate to 20% from 25% and would add a border adjustment tax. Last month Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, Dow industrials peer General Electric (GE) CEO Jeffrey Immelt, and other industrial exporters along with drugmakers Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY) and others wrote their own letter to congress urging support for the bill. Boeing has a lot to gain from the proposed tax overhaul. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts released a note Monday saying that Boeing's stock could jump 40% from the border adjustment tax alone. Boeing shares were down 0.2% to 178.73 on the stock market today. GE stock fell 1.1% to 29.54. Not all businesses support the House's blueprint. Wal-Mart (WMT), another Dow stock, strongly opposes a border adjustment tax, along with most retailers whose goods would become more expensive. Wal-Mart shares were up 1.1% to 70.72, retaking their 200-day moving average. While the tax blueprint is supposed to support jobs at home, Boeing will break ground on its finishing plant in Zhoushan by the end of March, according to a report from China's business media outlet Caixin out Tuesday. Boeing announced plans for the facility to finish 737s and started preliminary work in 2015 as it looks to build market share in the rapidly growing aerospace market. The workers at the plant will paint planes and install in-flight entertainment and other systems. While some work is being outsourced to China, Boeing has argued the plant will create more, not less, American jobs. "That finishing center is a location where we can add value in China, but every airplane that goes there is built in the U.S.," CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in January. "It's a great example of how growth in China creates growth in U.S. manufacturing jobs."

CDT March 14, 2017 neiman marcus1 (Photo: KHOU) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST The owners of department store chain Neiman Marcus are considering a sale of the company, among other options, as it struggles in an era of declining foot traffic and increased competition from online sellers. Neiman Marcus Group said in a statement that it is “undertaking a process to explore and evaluate potential strategic alternatives, which include the sale of the company or other assets.’’ The announcement came as the retail company reported a loss of $117.1 million in the quarter that ended Jan. 28, as compared to the $7.8 million profit the company eked out during the same three month period a year earlier. Many of retail's most iconic department stores are struggling to survive at a time when a growing number of consumers are choosing the ease of shopping online at Amazon, or gravitating toward the discounts and all-in-one shopping experience available at big box giants like Walmart. Sears announced in January that it would close 150 stores and sell its Craftsman tool brand, while Macy's closed 66 locations in its last fiscal year and is planning to close another 34. Neiman Marcus may already have a potential buyer. Canadian company Hudson's Bay which had reportedly been considering a merger with Macy's, is now interested in acquiring Neiman Marcus instead, according to CNBC which cited sources who spoke to Dow Jones. Hudson's Bay had been trying to secure funding to potentially purchase Macy's according to previous reports. But investors were hesitant about a deal that would anchor them in shopping malls which are seeing declining foot traffic. Now, Hudson's Bay is reportedly turning its attention to Neiman Marcus, which it would like to buy minus its $5 billion in debt, according to the CNBC report. Neiman Marcus, which was purchased in 2013 by Ares Management and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, planned an initial public offering two years later to help pay down its $4.9 billion in debt, according to Reorg Research. But Neiman's owners formally withdrew its bid to go public in January, says Reorg.  USA Today CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Investigation continues into report of shots fired at rodeo Viewer video: Chaos at RodeoHouston after reports of possible shooting 3 in custody after robbery at Pappas BBQ HPD responding to possible shooting at rodeo Popular gas station chain, Buc-ee's, sues roadside competitor Firefighters tackle blaze at refinery in Houston KHOU 11 Breaking News Navasota Train Death Vigil Rodeo attendees exit stadium following possible shooting Deadly fire in SE Houston More Stories Two arrests made in connection with suicide of Texas… Mar 16, 2017, 1:40 p.m. HPD: Bullet casing found on rodeo grounds, man arrested Mar 15, 2017, 10:03 p.m. 2 killed in fire at boarding house in SE Houston Mar 16, 2017, 4:40 a.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home Weather Health Detail Closings & Delays Location Search Radars Conditions Hurricane Central More...

Don’t ask why, and don’t ask how; it really doesn’t matter. What matters is that it’s there, and that the camera tilts down to see it: a visual metaphor that manages to punctuate the film in a way that can’t possibly have been intentional, saying everything you need to know about the movie while still managing to say absolutely nothing at all. Had director Richie Keen possessed even a modicum of self-effacing irony he would have opened with this shot and thrown the title on screen right then and there. And that’s “Fist Fight” in a nutshell. It isn’t even funny by accident, let alone on purpose. It’s a film where everyone shouts their dialogue BECAUSE THAT’S WHAT MAKES IT FUNNY, and where the word “f—k” is treated as both a foolproof set-up and punchline. As such, it’s just people shouting “f—k” without understanding that, like when you’re actually doing what the word means, it’s all in how you use it. This turgid, overlong cacophony of migraine-inducing noise is the feature-length equivalent of that last sketch of the night on any of the worst seasons of “Saturday Night Live,” snuck in during the final minutes before its shot and put out of our misery by the closing credits. The idea of two teachers (Charlie Day and Ice Cube) having an afterschool row in the parking lot has about five minutes’ worth of mineable material; in this case, it’s bloated, corpse-like, to eighteen times that length, decomposing gaseously before your very eyes. It’s like watching an autopsy video on the concept of humor. There are literally no jokes. It’s the aforementioned shouting (peppered at times with screeching), and a preoccupation with erect penises, masturbation, and ejaculation, all of which serve as metaphors for the People of Walmart filmmaking you’re watching. It’s unintentionally meta. Charlie Day continues to refine his performance as “Charlie Day,” while Ice Cube, who used to wear his Compton background as a seal of authenticity, continues his transformation into a safe and fuzzy Saturday morning cartoon caricature. Once upon a time, he was rapping about gang violence, or informing white America that to inner city youth, “Uncle Sam was Hitler without an oven.” Now, he’s play-fighting an actor from “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” inside a toilet stall while a nerdy kid jerks off to internet porn. Keepin’ it real! Straight-up hardcore frontin’ duties go to Day’s onscreen (and I’m pretty sure unnamed) daughter (Alexa Nisenson), who performs a song I’m happy to say I’d never heard and can’t be bothered to investigate for this review (because I’m keepin’ it real). This sequence, built around a climactic middle school talent show, is groundbreaking in its effort to raise the comedic bar. Instead of uptight old people dancing to rap music, “Fist Fight” has a pre-teen singing a rap song! With gang signs! And eff-bombs! That’s why it’s funny! KEEPIN’ IT F—KIN’ REAL! But maybe I’m off base. The audience at my preview screening spent the entire film in a near-convulsive state of hysteria so visceral that the floor was literally shaking from the stamping of feet. All the while my bitter migraine was exacerbated by the braying, hyena-like laughter fired directly into my ears. “Fist Fight” provoked a football-like response, as the crowd spent ninety-one minutes engaging the movie, directly – asking questions, repeating back every other line of dialogue, and kindly going so far as to narrate the action for the benefit of everyone else in their row (who, strangely, were all doing the same thing at the exact same time). This might have led to some missed spots on the crowd’s part, as I overheard more than one group trying to piece together the plot on the way out, or attempting to explain to their slightly slower companions the deep intricacies of the many penis jokes. In that respect, “Fist Fight” is an amazing success, as it can miss something as obvious as a (literally) shitty ending and its intended audience doesn’t even notice.

Comments aAFont Size On the calendar of the mind, March 1 can be the first day of spring. Big deal if it's not the official start, but it's springtime nonetheless with daffodils blooming, birds singing and grass getting green. What better way to usher in springtime than to hop on a bike to welcome a new season. That is, unless it's cold with a stiff breeze to match, as it was this March 1. So we moved the first day of springtime to March 3 on our mind's calendar, perfect for a ride on the Razorback Greenway. Sixty-eight degrees beats 40 when you're pedaling into a headwind. Ah, but we were on a mission this fine Friday afternoon. Two missions, really. First, to check out the new reroute of the Razorback Greenway that's just been finished near Village on the Creeks shopping area in Rogers. Second, to see if the temporarily closed section of the Greenway that goes under Interstate 49 near the Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion might have opened. We found the biking on the reroute to be fine and dandy. A second delight was seeing the closed section is open again. To get this springtime jaunt going, we started at the Rogers Regional Sports Park at Dixieland and Hudson roads. The concrete trail for bikes and feet heads west through town, near Mathias Elementary and into a pretty meadow and woods in the Turtle Creek neighborhood. This isn't part of the Razorback Greenway, but Rogers' own trail network. There are pedestrian traffic signals to help bikers cross Olive Street and busy Walnut Street. The path returns quickly to a quieter ride en route to New Hope Road where the Razorback Greenway reroute starts. Bikers, runners and walkers pass under Interstate 49 and continue west along flowing Osage Creek toward the shops and restaurants at Village on the Creeks. There's a nice new bridge on the trail over Osage Creek, where it's worth a stop to gaze at this pretty, urban stream. Now the ride gets really nice, meandering along the lake behind Village on the Creeks, before curving north to cross Stony Brook Road at another light. The Greenway now blocks away from the original route along bustling South 52nd Street. From here the Greenway goes up a moderate hill past some upscale apartments and then joins the original Razorback Greenway route, which heads north to Bentonville. The afternoon was perfect to spend on a bike. We kept heading north, past the Horsebarn Road trailhead where kids played in the creek and took turns on the swings. The Greenway heads into Bentonville through a tunnel under the traffic on Walton Boulevard. Trail travelers pass some wetlands, meadows and go past Bentonville High School. Then it's a short ride to the downtown square or farther to Lake Bella Vista. After a water break on the square, we pedaled back toward Rogers. At New Hope Road, springtime thoughts turned to that closed section of the Greenway under the interstate. Could it be open? We pedaled south, past the Mercy Hospital trailhead. Lo and behold, the trail is open again, at least it was on March 3. Barricades were removed and we met runners and walkers headed both ways. To ride from Bella Vista to Fayetteville or vice versa, one had to take a detour on busy streets to bypass the closed section. It was a hallelujah moment to see the trail open again. That made our ride back to the sports park even more pleasant. No telling how far we pedaled to ring in springtime. There's no odometer on our handlebars that tells the distance to the inch. Same reason we don't have a digital fish weighing scale in the boat. If you catch a big old bass, you can eyeball it and say, "That fish is 6 pounds, easy," when it might really only be four and a half on the scale. Then you release the fish. "Yep. Six pounds." That little ride on the Greenway had to be 30 miles. Yep, 30 miles, easy. Flip Putthoff can be reached at fputthoff@nwadg.com or on Twitter @NWAFlip.

Source: Ellentube JACKSON, MS (WDAM) - A Mississippi kid rapper and entrepreneur from Jackson was featured on the Ellen DeGeneres show Monday.  Cory J, AKA Lil C Note was interviewed by the comedian for his rapping skills and entrepreneurial business model.  Cory sold CDs in Walmart parking lots to raise money for toys. He even gave Ellen his best sales pitch. What he did with the money piqued Ellen's interest, and landed him a coveted interview on her show.  Cory told Ellen he went to different cities in Mississippi, Tennessee and Louisiana to give away $10,000 worth of toys to children in need.  "Why did you give away your money?" Ellen asked.  "Because I am a kid, and I would love to get free toys!" Cory exclaimed.  Cory then rapped a song that is featured on the albums he has sold.  To watch the entire interview, click here.  Copyright WDAM 2017. All rights reserved.

Does a bold statement like that seem incredulous? It's not. In general, the House Republican "A Better Way" tax blueprint has many excellent attributes. The problem is that the "pay for" is a direct hit on the apparel, footwear and retail industry. It is also a direct hit on the American consumer. Sen. Tom CottonTom CottonNervous GOP senators rooting for Ryan to fail Defense secretary pulls deputy's nomination: report Medicaid rollback looms for GOP senators in 2020 MORE (R-Ark.) expressed his concerns about working Americans getting stiffed (yet again) by adding tax to consumer items: "Why would we make the stuff they get at Wal-Mart more expensive?" he asked. Will people stop shopping for clothes and go naked? That's unlikely. But, as prices rise (perhaps by 20 percent or more), consumers will buy less — and several retailers will probably go bust in the process. If anyone thinks that retail is healthy, think again. If anyone thinks it's a good idea to kick an industry when its down, speak up now or forever hold your retail peace. If BAT passes, there will be fewer retail stores to clothe you, and fewer name brands to satisfy your fashion prerogatives. ADVERTISEMENT In the last few months, the retail community has seen a string of bankruptcies including, among them Pacific Sunwear, American Apparel, Eastern Mountain Sports, Bob's Stores, Sports Chalet, Quiksilver, Aeropostale and Golfsmith.   In addition, Limited Stores, Wet Seal and Sports Authority closed their doors for good. And JCPenney plans to close up to 140 stores, Abercrombie will close 60, Sears and Kmart 150, Macy's 68, Golfsmith 59, and Crocs 160. Any legislator who thinks retailers need another tax or price hike is not in tune with the current economic environment. Sure, we may have been a tad over-retailed, and sure, e-commerce has been nibbling away at brick and mortar store, but higher retail prices from a BAT tax? Really? Many in Washington have gone to great lengths explaining what the tax is meant to do. The problem is that 98 percent of all apparel and footwear is already imported, and the Republicans' BAT only targets imports. Wearable products won't get a second chance, especially after your accountant reveals that the cost of goods sold (if imported) is no longer deductible. Lowering the tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent while eliminating deductibility for cost of goods sold is like Siegfried and Roy making an elephant disappear while creating an amazing illusion. Taxing a larger amount at a lower rate doesn't help anyone, not even the elephant that was on the stage (he was also imported, by the way). Retailers will be forced to raise prices, and consumers will be forced to pay more, give up shopping, go naked or just get angry. With logic staring legislators in the face, why would anyone be concerned that BAT could happen? Well, Congress works in mysterious ways, and the BAT has a chance to make our apparel and footwear industry the sacrificial lamb of 2017, as revenue for the plan must come from somewhere, and we are the likely target. Right now, it appears that the House of Representatives has the votes and the power to pass this tax. To his credit, President Trump hasn't taken sides on the issue. He did comment in The Wall Street Journal that he had an issue with the word "adjustment" as he is never sure what someone is "adjusting." "Anytime I hear border adjustment," he said, "I don't love it. Because usually it means we're going to get adjusted into a bad deal." However, the president could side with the House of Representatives, and then all eyes will be fixated on the Senate. Likely, the Senate will reject the House bill and submit its own version — and that's a good situation. But, with conflicting legislation, the two groups end up in "conference" where they try to reconcile their differences behind closed doors. What will happen in that room is anybody's guess. The core problem is a more than a $1 trillion revenue shortfall occurs as the tax rate is lowered from approximately 35 percent to 20 percent — and that shortfall must be made up or the legislation becomes dysfunctional. Reconcilers may just decide to add the tax to wholesale or retail, and that action will certainly initiate a national consumer-centric disaster. It will put us back on the stage with Siegfried and Roy, along with the disappearing imported elephant. So, no doom and gloom. Just understand that everyone wants tax reform, and the House Republicans have the power to make this happen — or mess it up. If BAT passes, you will be paying more for your imported consumables. You will buy less, and you will have fewer places to shop. And, those are just the facts! The economic theory that the dollar will adjust (and all will be OK) is just absolute fiction.

 MCX technology to live on in Chase Pay BI Intelligence Mar. 14, 2017, 10:11 AM 449 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Here's what's holding back wearable payments THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY EXPLAINED: The Trends Creating New Winners And Losers In The Card-Processing Ecosystem Credit cards are going the way of fax machines This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Payments Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. JPMorgan Chase has agreed to purchase the payments technology of Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX), the consortium of large merchants, including Walmart, Chili's and Kohl's, behind the now-defunct mobile wallet “CurrentC.” The move is designed to help Chase boost uptick its own mobile wallet, Chase Pay, in two ways: MCX merchants will grow Chase Pay’s merchant footprint. Chase Pay’s website lists only two merchants presently accepting it – Starbucks and Best Buy – squeezing adoption potential significantly. Other merchants, including Walmart, Shell, and Phillips 66, plan to support Chase Pay in the near future. The acquisition could accelerate that integration. And the move could give Chase capabilities to integrate with merchants both within and outside of the conglomerate. The latest play comes the heels of two smaller merchant partnerships that also grew the wallets’ acceptance. It can also give user more reason to use the wallet. In addition to places to pay, customers need good reasons to pay with the wallet — that’s why Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay have failed to catch on despite being accepted at millions of merchants. Chase can tackle the user value proposition head on with MCX’s tools, including offers and discounts that redeem automatically at checkout. Chase’s recent $10 million investment in LevelUp was similarly designed to allow customers to order ahead and pay with Chase Pay — a strong incentive to use the wallet, and one that could encourage habitual usage. The acquisition offers an unexpected afterlife for MCX. The merchant’s mobile wallet “died” in June 2016, as MCX announced it was indefinitely postponing the rollout of CurrentC due to poor results in a limited trial. Now, the technology is back to help power Chase Pay, which was already seeking out MCX partners specifically. But time will tell whether the bank's wallet is brought down by the same factors that ended MCX — namely fragmentation and too much focus on aligning its merchants’ competing interests at the expense of the end-user experience.   Retailers like Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts are winning over consumers with their mobile wallets — apps developed by stores to make it easier for their customers to pay, and to deliver valuable perks.  And these retailer wallets are leading the overall mobile wallets industry, thanks to their ability to rapidly push out innovative features like rewards programs, coupons, mobile order-ahead, and custom marketing. This may be surprising considering that retailer mobile wallets can be used only at a specific retailer’s locations; in contrast, popular universal mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay can be used at multiple retailers, as long as users are using the necessary smartphones. Ayoub Aouad, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on retailer mobile wallets that assesses what makes them so successful and which retailers can most effectively leverage the technology to push sales, traffic, and average ticket size. The report also outlines what makes these mobile wallets attractive, and discusses some of the advancements being made in the payments industry that will affect mobile wallets' growth rate. Here are some key takeaways from the report:  Retailers with large addressable user bases who are loyal, repeat visitors, will see their mobile wallets continue to be popular with consumers, especially as there continues to be slow merchant adoption of near-field communication (NFC) technology as well as weak offerings by universal mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. Loyalty programs will be a significant driver in retailer mobile wallet adoption. Companies like Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts have been able to leverage their loyalty programs to acquire mobile wallet users, which, in turn, has driven store traffic and conversion rates. By leveraging these programs, sales are expected to grow at a five-year compound annual growth rate of 68%. However, adoption will begin to decelerate as a result of increased competition by 2020. As universal mobile wallet players begin to add effective loyalty programs and coupons to their offerings, adoption for retailer-based mobile wallets is likely to slow down because these offerings are their main marketing points.  In full, the report:  Explains what hurdles universal mobile wallets have faced. Details what features retailers have adopted into their mobile wallets that have been successful   Analyzes the use cases of retailers that have successfully leveraged their mobile wallet offerings to push growth. Identifies how universal mobile wallets will eventually slow growth for retailer-based mobile wallets.  Interested in getting the full report?

((Joe Songer/jsonger@al.com)) Print Email Guest Voices By Guest Voices AL.com on March 14, 2017 at 7:15 AM, updated March 14, 2017 at 8:06 AM comments Daniel Tait c/o Daniel Tait  By Daniel Tait, CEO, Energy Alabama, a nonprofit advocating for clean energy policies Alabama says it is open for business, but does it really mean it? A recent piece in AL.com explored many of the ways Alabama is, in fact, closed for business when it comes to renewable energy. The AL.com profile looked at a report titled the Corporate Clean Energy Procurement Index authored by the Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade group representing large retailers like Target, Walmart, Best Buy, Home Depot, and Lowe's. Alabama's score on the index was 1.82 out of 100. The next-lowest score was a 13.60; putting Alabama about as far behind as is technically possible. We can do better and there are a lot of reasons to do so. Take a look at solar's recent break-neck growth, according to the Solar Foundation Solar Jobs Census: One out of every 50 new jobs added in the United States in 2016 was created by the solar industry, representing 2 percent of all new jobs Over the next 12 months, employers surveyed expect to see total solar industry employment increase by 10 percent to 286,335 solar workers What about Alabama? Well, brace yourself. Alabama has just 287 workers in the solar industry. Our neighbors in Tennessee have almost 3800 workers in solar, and Florida has more than 6500. So where does the difference come from, because we're not that different from Tennessee or Florida, right? It's simple, the difference is policy. Alabama needs solid market-driven policies that will let the private sector do what it does best; work. The renewable energy industry is not asking for a handout, tax credit, or special treatment. However, it does deserve fair compensation and a level playing field. Businesses and homeowners deserve a choice about where their energy comes from. They should be allowed to lease systems, enter into power purchase agreements, and receive a fair market value for their investment. Taking the shackles off the private sector in Alabama will only increase competition and create opportunity for all energy sources. If we are serious about putting Alabamians to work in high paying jobs that give their families a fighting chance, we would invest in renewable energy. It's proven to create jobs and we have some of the best solar resource in the country. The place to start? Contact your state representatives about allowing Alabama to take advantage of renewable energy. The best way to begin is to ask them for an open integrated resource plan from regulated utilities and also ask for the state to draft a comprehensive energy plan. You can also contact the Alabama Public Service Commission at 1-800-392-8050 or you can submit a complaint online. The energy market is changing fast and it all comes down to proper planning.

It cuts through a thicket of dormant trees, passing a half-dozen trailer homes and after almost a mile runs into a line of boulders and a rusted railing with a sign: Road Closed. Chris Crowningshiele has been driving a cab, on and off, for 30 years in this rural corner of upstate New York known as the North Country. He lives south of here in Plattsburgh, and his fares usually come from ferrying students from a state university there or picking shoppers up at a Walmart in his gray minivan. But in recent weeks, riders have been asking him — two, three, sometimes as many as seven times a day — to bring them to the end of Roxham Road. He is carrying them on the last leg of their journey out of the United States. Just on the other side of that sign is Canada. Border officials and aid workers there say there has been a surge in people illegally crossing from the United States in the months since President Trump was elected, many of them natives of Muslim countries making bids for asylum. Roxham Road, just a brief detour from a major border crossing on Interstate 87, has become one of the busier illegal points of entry. Mr. Crowningshiele picks up passengers in Plattsburgh, mostly at the airport or the bus station, and over the 25-mile drive north, they have told him that they had traveled from across the country. Some were migrants from Yemen and Turkey. They confided that they were fearful, of what was happening in the countries they wanted to leave behind — not just their homeland but now also the United States — and of what they faced once they stepped out of Mr. Crowningshiele’s cab. “You wonder what’s going through their heads, you know?” he said. Many of his passengers have been families, with parents carrying young children and whatever possessions they could take with them. Champlain, a small town in a rural corner of upstate New York known as the North Country.CreditTodd Heisler/The New York Times “People just want to live their life,” Mr. Crowningshiele, 48, said, “and not be scared.” Given their proximity to Canada, people around here have always had some awareness of the world beyond the border. A pop music station in Montreal comes through clearly on the radio, and it is not all that unusual to make a run to the other side to shop. But the steady stream of cabs that have started driving up Roxham Road has forced them to reckon with life on the border and decisions made in Washington in ways they never have before. This is not exactly Trump Country. In Clinton County, which includes Champlain, Hillary Clinton eclipsed Mr. Trump by 610 votes. Many residents on Roxham Road said they did not bother to vote and had followed politics just enough to feel disenchanted, if not disgusted. “I used to just blow everything off,” said Melissa Beshaw, whose house is the second to last before the border. “I was never into politics until this road became famous.” She, like some others, was quick to assign blame to Mr. Trump. Immigration advocates in Canada said the reasons for fleeing were more complicated: The president’s executive order in January on immigration that affected countries that are mostly Muslim was certainly a factor, but so were frustration with the immigration process in general and concern over anti-Muslim rhetoric. Migrants have been coming to places like Roxham Road not because they want to sneak over the border; the expectation is to walk right into the arms of the Canadian authorities. An agreement between the United States and Canada makes it virtually impossible for them to ask for asylum at a legal border crossing; Canadian border officials would have to turn them back. But a technicality allows them to bypass the agreement by illegally setting foot in Canada. “Once they get arrested, they’re already on Canadian soil,” said Jean-Sébastien Boudreault, the president of the Quebec Immigration Lawyers Association, “so we have to let them do a refugee claim.” A family that crossed into Canada from the United States was arrested by a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer.CreditTodd Heisler/The New York Times A travel document covered in snow and mud near Champlain, where migrants trying to reach Canada have become a common sight.CreditTodd Heisler/The New York Times Just after a gentle rain let up on a recent afternoon, a blue Prius with a yellow taxi sign perched on its roof approached the border. A husband and wife got out. He loaded on a backpack, a duffel bag and several shopping bags. She carried a young boy. The couple declined to speak with a reporter, though the man said they were Turkish. The family was the second spotted arriving that day on Roxham Road, with at least two other cabs coming later. By the count of the people living on the road, it was a slow day. Almost 20 people had come the day before. As the family approached the border, a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police told them it was not legal for them to enter here. If they continued, he said, they would be arrested. “I apologize about this,” the man replied, his voice unsure, “but I have to break your rules.” He paused. “I’m sorry.” The couple hopped across a narrow, mucky creek that divides the two countries. A Canadian officer gently grabbed the woman’s left arm as she held her son in the crook of her right arm, helping her up. Lawyers said families like this one were usually taken to immigration offices at the nearest legal border crossing, where they can officially ask for asylum. If they have identification and do not appear to pose a security threat, the lawyers said, they are typically released and given a bus ticket to Montreal, where they wait for a hearing on their refugee status. Many of them are staying at a Y.M.C.A. there. The border crossings, despite being freighted with emotion, happen quickly and can seem almost procedural, occurring over and over every day in recent weeks.

He said that years ago the road had been an official crossing. He certainly has noticed the pickup in traffic recently. He has seen people left at the intersection, forced to drag their suitcases a mile through the snow. His sleep apnea keeps him awake, he said, and he has seen taxis creeping up the road in the dead of night. Mr. Hogle did not vote in November and said he was “leery” of Mr. Trump. On some counts, he said, the president is “doing all right.” Mr. Trump’s campaign promises about the economy and bringing back jobs had some appeal. There are some jobs around here, mostly in warehouses, Mr. Hogle said, but he wished there was better-paying work. He used to be a forklift driver in a warehouse before a medical condition left him on disability. His wife works at a gas station and at a discount store. “I think what he set out to do, he’s doing,” Mr. Hogle, 54, said of Mr. Trump. “He’s a man of his word.” He understood the president’s motivation in pursuing his immigration policies, but the situation at his own doorstep made him question the “way he went about it.” “I can see his point of view,” he said. “He’s trying to protect the United States. It’s hard. Some are good. Not everybody’s bad. Just like the white man — you have good ones and you have bad ones. There should be something better than this.” Across the street from Mr. Hogle, Matthew Turner said the influx had been unsettling. “I’m not O.K. with it,” he said of the border crossings, “but I definitely can’t blame them.” He recently discovered the lock on his shed had been tampered with and worried that border security was not tight enough. A resident of Champlain standing near the Canadian border. CreditTodd Heisler/The New York Times “I used to hunt along the border,” said Parker Cashman, who was staying with Mr. Turner, “and there’s too many places where it’s too easy to cross.” “Maybe we need to build a wall!” Mr. Turner replied, jokingly. “Have Canada pay for it!” He pointed out that Roxham Road can be hard to find. Until recently, if you typed it into Google Maps, the pinpoint landed on a roadway on the other side of the border. “It’s almost like this road doesn’t exist,” said Mr. Turner, a 21-year-old warehouse worker. It is unclear how the border hoppers, as some call them, first found Roxham Road. There are moments when residents are frustrated by it, like the day when local television stations discovered what was happening and came out with their satellite trucks. But, mostly, they sympathize with the people passing through. Ms. Beshaw, who stays at home to raise two grandsons in her custody, said she had never had a conversation or even shared a word with the migrants. But she has watched as the taxis arrive again and again, and she sees the passengers, especially the children, getting out and trudging through rain, snow and bitter cold.

Still, she understands their motivation. “All they want is a life like what we have,” she said. Ms. Beshaw also wishes that life for her would return to how it was just a few weeks ago. “It was a quiet road,” she said wistfully. As dusk settled in, dogs could be heard yapping through the woods, and Ms. Beshaw’s grandsons pedaled around on their bicycles, chasing each other. Before long, darkness blanketed the trees and stars freckled the vast country sky. All was quiet on Roxham Road, except for the babbling water in the ditch. Still, just over the border, Mounties were posted on a muddy hill, waiting for the next car to arrive. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/nyregion/champlain-ny-canada-migrants.html?nl=todaysheadlines&emc=edit_th_20170308&_r=0 Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

At 7 p.m. Saturday, police responded to a woman at Wal-Mart, 4104 N. Vermilion St., who told them that she had left children in her vehicle in the parking lot while she shopped inside, and at some point a man and a woman approached it and forced the two young children to get out, then drove away, leaving them in the parking lot. The children were not injured The vehicle was later found in Indianapolis in the possession of Dwayne Jackson, 24, of Peoria and Julia Hill, 22, of Chillicothe, just north of Peoria. Both were taken into custody. After a review by the Vermilion County State's Attorney's Office, arrest warrants were issued for Jackson and Hill on charges of vehicular hijacking, with bond set at $100,000. Both are currently still in custody in Marion County, Ind., on charges of possession of a stolen vehicle. The investigation into the incident continues, and anyone with information is asked to call Danville police at 217-431-2250 or, if wishing to remain anonymous, Vermilion County Crime Stoppers at 217-446-TIPS.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds subscribe Site Archive Council to hear financial report, TAB fund report Wednesday Tuesday Mar 14, 2017 at 12:01 AM Jessica Weston City Editor Jessica_Weston9 In what looks to be a full agenda, the Ridgecrest City Council will hear a presentation about the fiscal year 2016 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, also known as the CAFR. Overall, according to the CAFR, the city “is witnessing a leveling off of the recession along with mild growth.” The report will be presented by Ken Pun, of the Pun Group LLP and is available for viewing online as an agenda attachment at http://ridgecrest-ca.gov/council-agendas The report notes that any conclusions are reached based on data supplied by the city: “Responsibility for the accuracy of the data presented and completeness and fairness of the presentation, including disclosures, rests with the City.” Council will also hear a report on TAB funds and will discuss and provide direction to Mayor Peggy Breeden, who represents the city on the Indian Wells Valley Groundwater Authority Board, as to whether she should vote for the by-laws. Council will also decide whether to move forward with the bid process for the Pearson/Upjohn Parks project. FY 2016 CAFR First up on the agenda is a presentation of the CAFR for fiscal year 2016. An introductory section in the report describes the city's economic outlook in cautiously optimistic terms, noting that “[a]fter experiencing the worst economic decline in recent history, the City’s financial position has begun to stabilize with modest improvements.” The report describes the city's economic outlook as “favorable” and notes that based on data from the Economic Development Department, the city has maintained job levels and the city's unemployment rate has dropped from 6.9 to 6.1 percent. According to the report, the city received $2.69 million in revenue from Measure L during fiscal year 2016. Measure L, of course, is a 0.75 percent voter approved general fund sales tax that went into effect Oct. 1, 2012. It will end March 31, 2017. At that point, the voter approved follow-on, Measure V will kick in. Measure V increases the tax amount to 1 percent. Representatives of the city have repeatedly stated that the extra 0.25 percent will go toward road projects. Permitting and construction activity is trending upward. The report attributes some of this increase to the influence of the new Walmart Super Center which opened last year. Permits in 2016 totaled 1,305, as opposed to 615 in 2015 and 1,020 in 2014. The report notes several developments which it implies have led Ridgecrest to have a positive outlook for economic development in 2017. These include the opening of the new Walmart, the planned “entertainment project” or casino complex, and the new Tractor Supply and Harbor Freight locations. The report also mentions 450 planned jobs at NAWS as another positive. This circumstance is uncertain at the present time, however, due to President Trump's civil service hiring freeze. Other topics Also on the agenda is a report on TAB funds including permitted uses, current funding allocations and the current status of the economic development TAB grant contracts. For more on this topic, see the March 11 edition of the Daily Independent. Council is also scheduled to decide whether or not to direct Breeden to vote to approve the draft IWVGA bylaws. At the previous meeting council voted 3-2 to present comments to the full JPA board with the stipulation that council “requires a written explanation of any further objections to the recommendations.” As of the time of agenda compilation, council had not yet heard back from the groundwater authority. If they have not heard anything back by the time of the meeting, they will presumably decide how to direct Breeden to vote. The bylaw draft was already approved by the IWVGA pending approval of the member agencies. Council will also be asked to decide whether to re-bid the Upjohn/Pearson Parks Project. According to a staff report, there is some uncertainty whether staff was directed to re-bid the project due to a technical error during the bidding process when the topic was discussed at a council meeting Jan. 18. Staff is seeking clarification as to whether they should re-bid the project or not. Also on the agenda are several consent calendar items relating to construction. Council will be asked to approved notices of completion on the Gateway Boulevard project and the Bowman Road Traffic Signal and Fiber Optic Communication System Installation. Also on the consent calendar is an item approving the Ridgerunner Title VI plan for 2017. The consent calendar also contains a contract with Quad Knopf Inc. for design, engineering and construction management for a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality Project for South Sunland Avenue for $148,660. Also on the consent calendar is an agreement with Willdan Engineering for design engineering and construction management for a regional surface transportation project Eastside of Downs Ave from West Ridgecrest Boulevard to Upjohn Avenue for $121,440. The consent calendar also contains an item setting the John S. Ward Respect for Law presentation for the Elks Lodge Friday March 31 at 5:30 p.m. Note: the special closed session will begin at 4:30 p.m. On the closed session agenda are a conference with legal counsel over a liability claim of F. Raynor, personnel matters regarding the City Attorney and Special City Counsel and an On-Call Planning Services Consultant and a public employee performance evaluation of the City Manager. The regular council meeting is scheduled for Wednesday March 15 at 6 p.m., at City Council Chambers at City Hall, 100 W. California Ave in Ridgecrest.

But he knew there were two ways to enter the country: legally or illegally. “I always said I wanted to go legally because I was scared of the alternative,” said Hernandez, who is now 18 and in his senior year at Westhill High School. The only affordable option was to be smuggled on an underground railroad of sorts from Honduras’s border with Guatemala, through Mexico and finally over Tijuana’s border with San Diego, California. “I came home at about 6:30 p.m. one night when I was nine years old, and there’s a suitcase packed in my room,” Hernandez said. “My grandma tells me, ‘You’re going to the United States tomorrow.’” Hernandez knew the day would come. He was four years old when his mother left Honduras to find work in the U.S. She spent the next six years saving up the $11,000 it would take to get her oldest son safely across the border and away from the gang violence that had endangered their family for generations. The next morning, Hernandez and his grandmother stood in a crowded bus terminal in San Pedro Sula, the Honduran capital city. “That was a lot to take in,” Hernandez said. “I was like, ‘wow, this exists here in my country?’ Because I’m from a very small town that’s tucked in the mountains. The most modern thing about the town was that we had electricity—sometimes.” Hernandez and his grandmother met up with a Guatemalan man who had been hired to bring him to his new “Aunt Santos,” a woman who helped children cross over to the U.S. The man moved quickly, and Hernandez struggled to keep up. He was finally stopped in his tracks at the top of an escalator. “I didn’t know how to use it — I was so terrified,” Hernandez said. “If there is any metaphorical threshold I had to cross to get to the U.S., that’s it.” The journey For each crossing with Aunt Santos and her surrogates, Hernandez was given a new identity to memorize. When he arrived in Tijuana, the last stop on the long trek up the Mexican coast, he was given a fake American identity—his ticket into the U.S. Hernandez sat in the backseat of a yellow convertible at the Californian border, while his 22-year-old driver answered border agents’ questions. “We just told them we were going to Wal-Mart in San Diego to buy toys,” Hernandez said with a laugh. “And we weren’t really lying. We actually did go shopping for toys at Wal-Mart — we just never came back.” Eventually, Hernandez traveled to the east coast of Virginia, where his mother picked him up at a rest stop and brought him the rest of the way to Stamford. Proud American During the transition to American life, Hernandez had what he called his most formative moment here. Playing basketball with his younger brother, who he met for the first time in Stamford, a teenage boy rode up on a bicycle and began taunting Hernandez and his brother. “He stole our basketball, he got into our house ... he kept trying to say something to me, but I just couldn’t understand and I could tell he was getting frustrated,” Hernandez said. “Then, he spat on my face and he left.” In that moment, Hernandez realized he needed to fully commit to life as an American. He worked hard to learn English and move out of the ESL classes at Northeast Elementary School. “I didn’t have to abandon my culture, but I had to integrate into this new country,” he said. A self-described “undocumented and unafraid” Honduran-American, who orchestrated a rally for student immigrants in front of the government center earlier this month, said he is grateful for the educational opportunities he has received since moving here eight years ago. He is also now a master of language — fluent in Spanish, English, French and Italian. Heading into the final months of his high school career, Hernandez awaits permanent-residence status in preparation for college. He’s hopeful the green card will arrive by the time he starts getting letters from Harvard, the University of Chicago and NYU — his top college choices — but regardless of his status, Hernandez said he became an American a long time ago. “Being an American is more than a piece of paper to me. It’s in here,” he said, fist-pounding his chest. “To be an American is to live in the world ... to be surrounded by different cultures.” nnaughton@stamfordadvocate.com; @noranaughton Sign Up for Email Alerts Sign up for our email newsletters    Breaking News    Daily Newsletter EMAIL: Most Popular 1 Stamford restaurants get poor ratings from city 2 Stamford math whiz to graduate college at 16 3 Downtown Stamford loses trio of restaurants 4 Police: 3-year-old girl lived alone with dead mom for days 5 Calm weather day today; more snow ‘likely’ Saturday 6 Stamford cop honored for role in murder investigation 7 Despite regional appetizers, food halls yet to bust out in...

Workday adopted early as a proof-point for a cloud approach and Workday Financials. By Larry Dignan for Between the Lines | March 9, 2017 -- 11:00 GMT (03:00 PST) | Topic: Cloud Workday is betting that a new revenue recognition standard to be adopted over the next year or so will be a catalyst to highlight financial systems based in the cloud. More Cloud TV videos Cloud computing powers Nissan Leaf and will be key for autonomous driving Dunkin' Brands CISO tells how cloud solutions help them drive customer engagement and loyalty Accenture CTO Paul Daugherty on how the cloud enables the AI revolution Forrester Research's senior analyst Clement Teo gives 6 reasons why cloud is a no-brainer When Workday reported its fourth quarter results last month, executives such as Robynne Sisco spent a lot of time talking about ASC 606. In a nutshell, ASC 606 is a new revenue recognition standard that melds international accounting with the US. You can wonk out all you want on the accounting standard change here and here, but the primary CXO takeaway is that Workday adopted ASC 606 early, was dinged a bit on guidance for the new fiscal year and may have landed a entry to sell Workday Financials more. Workday beats Q4 expectations | Workday touts Amazon as latest customer win | Workday lands massive Walmart contract By being the first software company to adopt ASC 606, Sisco said Workday was aiming for two constituencies. The first was customers who needed to know they could use Workday Financials for ASC 606. The second one was investors so they could know what it means to Workday and revenue trends. Workday pulled its billings guidance due to ASC 606 and a few analysts were miffed. Sisco said Workday doesn't look at billings as a key metric internally. "There is some marketing benefit to it (ASC 606)," said Sisco. "Adopting it early shows the value of a SaaS financial system and the ability to deliver functionality ahead of the accounting change." What Sisco is hoping is that Workday Financials gets a look from enterprises, who may have already adopted Workday HCM, who are struggling to tweak legacy on-premises financial systems. "ASC 606 may allow companies to realize that this isn't the last accounting change that's going to happen." On the fourth quarter earnings conference call, Sisco outlined the following rationale for ASC 606 adoption. We elected to adopt ASC606 under the full retrospective method. As required by this method, we have fully restated FY16 and FY17 under the new standard using financial data all the way back to 2010. We were able to adopt under this method because we have detailed accessible historical data in our Workday financial system. Under this method all future reporting will be under the new standard only. We believe many companies will have difficulty accessing their data as far back as necessary and in enough detail to adopt the full retrospective method and will therefore adopt what is known as the modified retrospective method instead. Workday Financial Management functionality also supports the dual reporting under both the old and new standards, which is required under this alternative method of adoption. Simply put, Workday sees an accounting change as a marketing event. To Workday, a bet that potential customers will look at the money they will spend on customization for ASC 606 and consider cloud alternatives makes sense. "We believe a lot of companies will be looking at a wholesale shift to the cloud," said Sisco.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Business Asda offers 135,000 UK store employees £8.50 per hour as part of new contract The offered rate is £1 more than the National Living Wage of £7.44. By Kedar Grandhi March 14, 2017 04:25 GMT Asda said around 95% of its staff would gain by choosing the new contract and some of them could earn an additional £1,000 annuallyMatt Cardy/Getty Images Supermarket retailer Asda is offering a pay rise to its 135,000 store employees in Britain. The company announced on Monday (13 March) that the new £8.50 ($10.37) per hour rate would be offered from October 2017 as part of a new "Your Choice" contract. The offered rate is £1 more than the government's National Living Wage of £7.44, which is set to come into effect from 1 April 2017. The Walmart subsidiary claimed that its offer was one of the highest hourly pay rates in the UK supermarket sector. Asda said that employees accepting the new contract would benefit from flexible work timings. The supermarket chain said that this flexibility would help customers as well and would allow the company to place the right staff in the right place at the right time. A few more changes have been incorporated in the new contract like working on bank holidays if needed, annual leave of 28 days including bank holidays, all breaks being unpaid, change in the "night shift window" and an increase in night shift "premium". The Leeds-headquartered firm has assured that the renewed contract will not be a zero hours contract and staff will retain guaranteed minimum hours. It added that other non-pay benefits such as colleague discount, pension, sharesave and bonus will remain unchanged. Other geographic and role premiums will also remain the same. As per Asda's calculations, 95% of its staff would gain by choosing the new contract and some of them would earn an additional £1,000 annually. Commenting on the move, Asda senior vice president of People, Hayley Tatum said in a statement, "Our colleagues have always made Asda special. We want to be the best we can for our customers, which means not only investing in our products and prices but critically, we also need to invest in our people. "Our colleagues help our customers every day and we want to offer them a rate of pay that recognises the amazing job they do." Meanwhile, UK's general trade union GMB has reportedly given its seal of approval for the new contract. The union's general secretary Tim Roache said, "These new flexible contracts will help to ensure job security, ensure those accepting them are on the same terms and - best of all – ensure that people will earn more money as a result. The new contract offer involves quite a few changes, but as it's voluntary, this allows colleagues to choose whatever suits their circumstances best."

(John Carl D'Annibale / Times Union) Photo: John Carl D'Annibale Buy this photo Bigger ban on foam rejected 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Albany After months of public comment largely in support of Albany County expanding its ban on foam products, the county Legislature Monday defeated the bill to expand the measure. The lawmakers voted 21-16, with one abstention, opposing the expansion. The ban on polystyrene – commonly known as Styrofoam – was initially enforced in 2014 on chain food establishments only. The expansion would have encompassed all food service businesses inspected by the Albany County Health Department, but doesn't apply to raw meat, poultry or seafood sold to be cooked at home, or for appliances packaged in foam. The measure, which was sponsored by a several progressive Democrats, was voted down by the 10 minority Republicans and 11 Democrats. GOP Legislator Todd Drake of the Latham said the proposed expansion picks on small businesses and community organizations, and instead further regulation should focus on big businesses that sell foam products like Walmart and Sam's Club. "When you talk about setting the tone, it's not about cost for me," he said. "I want to set the tone that Albany County is a good place to do business." Democratic legislators favored expanding the ban out of concern about the product's environmental impact, including waste in the local landfill, and potential effects on public health. As to concerns about hurting business, Democrat Bill Reinhardt of Slingerlands told his fellow legislators before the vote: ""The economy is always changing. We're always changing what we make and what we consume. Don't just think about the status quo. Vote for innovation and our future economy." Industry lobbyists and some business owners said it would be cost prohibitive on businesses, and they called for a stronger effort to recycle foam products. Scott Wexler, executive director of the Empire State Restaurant and Tavern Association, applauded the vote's result. "Our restaurants were particularly ticked off that they were being singled out," he said. "Most of our members would like the choice, not have that decision dictated for them." He said over 100 business owners submitted letters and petitions in opposing the measure. The bill had allowed businesses to opt out if switch from foam containers to compostable or recyclable products would be a financial burden. Over 1,700 county residents and roughly 40 local small businesses submitted petitions urging legislators to expand the foam ban. "I think we we're all let down and we're disappointed that they're not listening to their constituents," said Caitlin O'Brien, with Environmental Health Advocates of New York. Foam takeout containers and coffee cups typically are the cheaper option, however there's the potential for styrene – a chemical used to make foam products that is a "reasonably anticipated" carcinogen – to leach into fatty or hot foods, according to a report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Polystyrene also takes hundreds of years – if ever – to decompose. While the county Board of Health previously said there was "insufficient data" to determine any adverse public health effects from using foam products, it recognized the ban would be beneficial for the environment and could reduce the burden on landfills. afries@timesunion.com • 518-454-5353 • @mandy_fries News Videos Most Popular 1 Boy, 10, dies after being trapped under snow pile 2 18-hour manhunt in Bethlehem ends with arrest 3 AG seized cellphone of DA Joel Abelove 4 The highest and lowest SAT scores in the Capital Region 5 Driver admits she was drunk in deadly Colonie crash 6 McDonald's tweets to Trump: 'You are actually a disgusting... 7 Be on the lookout for 'eraser challenge' a new and disturbing...

Across the U.S. about 850,000 store employees met the qualifications to receive a bonus in their March 9 paycheck. The bonus averaged $184.70 per person. Wal-Mart said more than 20,000 store employees in Arkansas received their share of the bonus along with annual pay raises for those who qualify. Store employees may earn quarterly bonuses based on store performance. In Northwest Arkansas, employees shared more than $ 1.1 million in fourth quarter bonuses. Statewide the bonus pool totaled $3.1 million, according to Wal-Mart. The retailer said in the most recent full fiscal year its store employees shared more than $700 million in bonuses. CEO Doug McMillon paid tribute to store workers with a post to his Facebook page recently. McMillon has said taking care of employees is key for the company reaching its financial goals, which is why he doled out more than $2 billion in higher pay and increased training over the past two years. Sometimes you need to say “Thank You” in an extra-special way. #TeamWalmart تم نشره بواسطة ‏‎Doug McMillon‎‏ في 9 مارس، 2017 “We’re proud to be leaders in the new world of retail. No other retailer offers as wide a range of jobs, training opportunities, room for advancement, benefits and the opportunity for financial advancement as Walmart,” said Rogers store manager Tina Budnaitis. “We have invested in wages and training to create a system that can help our associates go as far as they want to.” Wal-Mart’s top executives’ bonus pay for fiscal 2017 will be detailed in the company’s Proxy filing with the Securitiy and Exchange Commission next month. Looking at fiscal 2016, the top executives received the following cash bonus pay: • Doug McMillon $3.406 million • Brett Biggs $924,965 • Greg Foran $2.491 million • David Cheesewright $2.47 million • Rosalind Brewer $1.812 million Wal-Mart Stores is the largest employer in the state operating 127 retail stores. The retailer said it spent $8.1 billion with local suppliers and supported 46,000 suppliers jobs last year in Arkansas. Wal-Mart also said it collected $428 million in state sales tax last year and paid another $295 million in taxes to the Natural State.

Wall Street Daily Home Innovation GeoMacro Special Situations Contributors Free Reports Archives About Us Home Innovation GeoMacro Special Situations Contributors Free Reports Archives About Us WSD Team Contact Us Archives Ensure Email Delivery Frequently Asked Questions Broker Listing Profit From the Rise of Ghost Malls Published Mon, Mar 13, 2017  |  Martin Hutchinson, Senior Analyst Malls are scary places these days. Derelict malls have become attractive venues for drug addicts, homeless people and even the bodies of murdered people. Heck, why live on the cold streets of, say… Minneapolis, when there’s an empty Aéropostale to call home? Meanwhile, malls lucky enough to still operate have problems of their own. On the day after Christmas, CNN reported massive brawls and food court fights at more than a dozen malls across the country. Yikes. The age of malls is over, folks. Top retail analyst Jan Kniffen says about one-third of U.S. malls will close in the coming years. Bottom line, capitalism forces businesses to adapt or die. For companies like J.C. Penney and Sears, the chance to adapt has long passed. But what about some of America’s other great retailers? I asked my senior analyst Martin Hutchinson to drill down on the retail sector. With a handful of once-great retailers destined for the courthouse steps, we have an opportunity to profit from their demise. Hutch’s full report is below. Smart investing, Louis Basenese Chief Investment Strategist, Wall Street Daily   Question: Martin, I’m concerned about the border adjustment tax and how it will impact retailers. I’m hearing some chatter on both sides, but by and large, it’s negative. Is this going to be a net positive or negative for retailers? Martin Hutchinson: I think the border adjustment tax doesn’t have all that high a chance of being introduced. But if it is introduced, it will be a big negative for retailers, because most of them are big importers. You’ve got companies like Wal-Mart, which are importing from China. Their costs will increase by 20% with the border adjustment tax, and inevitably, that’s going to affect sales. And retailers are incredibly sales dependent. So that’s one particular factor impacting retailers — but there are several others. The main one is e-commerce, which was 8.1% of total sales in 2016, up from 7.3% in 2015. Now that’s still not a huge share of the market, but it’s eating away at the brick-and-mortar retail market steadily. And obviously, it can only get bigger. That’s a pretty big head wind, if someone else is taking market share from you every year. And then on the cost end, there are minimum wage rises. It doesn’t matter if it’s 5% or 10%. But some places are raising minimum wage to $15 like Seattle or New York City. I mean the whole state of New York is going to $12.50. That’s a huge increase in cost for low-end retailers like the Wal-Marts and Targets of this world. It doesn’t matter too much at Nordstrom, because they will pay more than that. But at the low end, it’s a big cost increase. Question: Hutch, can we talk a little bit about what seems to be the end of the mall culture in this country? I have to tell you, I try to avoid malls at all costs these days, but I had to go the other day. And it was kind of depressing. I’m one of these folks that has moved all of my purchasing, as much as I can anyhow, onto online — particularly Amazon. It’s almost depressing being in a mall these days. What can you tell us about that? Martin Hutchinson: That’s quite right, and it’s not just the world getting older. It’s that the malls are getting older as well. We were building 140 a year in the mid-1990s. But there were no new malls built from 2007–2012. Nearly 3% of malls in 2014 are dying. Which is defined as more than 40% vacancies. And if they’ve lost their anchor store, they’re in real trouble. Two hundred of 1,300 were said to be going out of business in 2016. Rising interest rates, obviously, will choke off any new construction in that area. And frankly, old, unattractive malls are just not nice places to be. They will drive people toward online. And you got some other things that will do that as well. The cost cutting, for instance, pushes people to online. For example, Eddie Lampert, who is the hedge fund guy who owns Sears, stopped cleaning the stores for several years. Now that doesn’t help traffic. As a Sears customer myself, I can assure you it was repulsing. You can generate cash through a leaseback, which Macy’s is doing currently — and Sears has done it. But Sears is now selling outright because they’re losing so much money. You can close and sell stores, which Sears and J.C. Penney are doing, but all that’s reducing your business over time. So the outlook for general retailers just isn’t very good. Question: Hutch, listening to you, it doesn’t sound like this is savable — especially for the bigger retailers. Is there a way our readers out there might be able to position themselves and profit from this? Martin Hutchinson: Well, yes, that’s what one is always looking for. The specialty retailers will do all right. For example, Ulta Beauty is expected to report good figures and is trading on 46 times earnings. That’s probably excessive. We’re in a bull market, but the specialists probably don’t have too much of a problem. But the general stores that are not on the top end have real problems. In other words, not the Nordstroms and the Neiman Marcuses of the world. And so I think we can play this fairly easily. Puts on Macy’s, for example. Its profits were down 13% in the fourth quarter. Sales are expected to be down 2% or 3% in the first quarter of 2017. Debt was just downgraded from BBB to BBB- — so one more downgrade and it’s junk. It closed 66 stores in 2016, and it plans to close another 34 this year. Now you know that’s not a happy picture, because if you’re closing stores all the time, you’re reducing your footprint and reducing your market share. The company is currently trading around $32. And the $25 January 2019 puts would cost you about $3 each. Now, if Macy’s hits its October 2008 price of $7.42, you’ll make six times your money on that trade. You’ll make 238% profit even if it gets to double its 2008 price. So overall, I think those puts at $25, costing you about $3, are a very good deal and a good value play on Macy’s — and to play the problems that retailers currently have. Question: Not a particularly uplifting conversation today, Hutchinson, especially talking about the demise of an American institution in Macy’s. But it just proves that there are profit opportunities on the downside too, if we’re willing to look for them, right? Martin Hutchinson: Very much so. Question: Thanks a lot, Hutchinson. We’ll talk to you again next week. This is Wall Street Daily signing off.

In November, Lowe’s Hardware Store debuted a bilingual customer service robot that shows users where to find specific items in-store by rolling around and taking them there itself. LoweBot, which has been spotted around several San Francisco Bay Area stores, wanders through aisles and approaches people, asking whether it can be of any service, and uses a series of cameras and lasers to navigate the shop. “I’m Lowe’s Robot helper. I can tell you where things are in the store,” announces the robot as it approaches customers. “Can I help you find something?” Both Lowe’s and Walmart appear to be using increased technological involvement in their stores to compete with the wave of online stores, such as Amazon, which allow users to find products immediately and hardly ever run out of stock.

By Abhineet Kumar & Raghavendra Kamath , Business Standard, Mumbai | In Others | March 14, 2017 4SHARES D-Mart bucked trend in India by choosing a cluster approach for densely populated residential areas. Euphoria around the Avenue Supermarts (D-Mart) initial public offering (IPO) of equity that saw 104 times more demand than the shares on offer might have overlooked a critical factor in the company's growth so far. Namely, the predominant ownership model for its stores. The company had rapid growth in recent years, with 112 stores as of September 2016, from one in 2002. Though rapid, the net profit grew to Rs 321 crore in 2015-16 from Rs 60 crore in 2011-12, a compounded annual rate of 51.8 per cent. This, however, has been largely dependent on the predominant ownership model it chose. Including long-term lease arrangements, where the period is more than 30 years and the building is owned by the company. This is different from the rental model its peers, including Future Retail and Reliance Retail, chose. "Retail is a low-margin business. So, it is very important to not only keep the cost low but predictable," says Pinakiranjan Mishra, partner and sector leader at consutancy EY. Many of the successful retailers of the world have chosen the ownership model. US-based Wal-Mart, Dutch retail chain Ikea and American fast food chain McDonald's have thrived on it. Many Indian retailers have, however, chosen a rental model due to the high real estate cost in India. However, when rental cost became unviable, they needed to relocate the stores, which meant a decline in same-store sales (SSS) growth. "It is also a location-sensitive business. Global retailers sometimes own their stores and, in some cases, even the entire mall, to create value for the retail destination, save cost and ensure predictability of cost," says Mishra. D-Mart bucked the trend in India by choosing a cluster approach for densely populated residential areas having a majority of lower middle and middle class consumers, instead of high-street addresses. Many times, it bought land at underdeveloped locations close to such a cluster and built the property. Then, offering an 'every day low price (EDLP)' and every day low cost (EDLC)', it got regular customers. Who made the store a shoppers' destination. This is a time and capital consuming approach than renting space in developed localities. In hindsight, it helped the company in improving SSS, while peers struggled to remain at locations where rental increased sharply. "Real estate is an asset for the company. When we are making a 22-23 per cent return on capital, why should we lease properties?" says Ramakanth Baheti, finance head at Avenue Supermarts. D-Mart had tangible assets of Rs 2,300 crore as on end-December. Owning assets does not by itself ensure that stores achieve break-even faster. The company achieves this through further minimising operating costs. Beside the predominant ownership model, it procures goods directly from vendors and manufacturers, employing an efficient logistics and distribution system, and maintaining a strong focus on product assortment to minimise inventory build, supported by efficient store operations. "While others pay lease rents, we pay interest," says Baheti. The company has debt of Rs 1,400 crore, with a 9-9.5 per cent average cost of funds. The company treats its real estate as plant and machinery, and does not plan to unlock its value. However, in its draft prospectus (DRHP) for the IPO, it says the ownership model requires greater capital for opening of each store, due to which it might not be able to expand at its historical rates. The objective of the IPO seems in sync with this. The offer, likely to be priced at the top end of the price band of Rs 295-299 a share, will be Rs 1,840 crore. Of this, Rs 1,080 crore will be used to retire debt and Rs 367 crore for setting up of new stores. It also shows that having grown till now from internal accrual and debt, it is now looking for public money to bring down its cost of capital for future growth through the ownership model. "D-Mart will struggle in the coming years to continue with its predominant ownership model," says Arvind K Singhal, chairman, Technopak Advisors, which prepared a sector report at the request of D-Mart. "Availability of real estate at an affordable price is now a question. Going forward, they might have a higher mix of rentals to maintain revenue growth." 4SHARES © 2017 Business Standard     Stay Updated with Us Top 10 Stories Last Week Last Month Last Year Meet Sumeet Vyas, the poster boy of the web series...

"I see contradictions everywhere, and I see historic moves that are based on false preconceptions, or an atmosphere that is too bullish for my tastes," the "Mad Money" host said. Cramer expects retailers to make the case that a border tax could force them to lay off thousands of people. The loss of retail jobs could overwhelm whatever jobs are created by manufacturing. Marginal retailers won't be able to keep the pace with Amazon or Wal-Mart if they have to pay more for their goods. "They will most likely not make it. That is a real risk, not a canard," Cramer said. Regardless if the tax is phased in or not, Cramer is already seeing signs in retail stock that signal tremendous losses and massive layoffs if Congress passes a border tax. Luke Sharrett | Bloomberg | Getty Images An employee arranges a sneaker display at a Foot Locker Inc. store inside the South Park Mall in Strongsville, Ohio. J. Jill is a recent IPO in retail that stood out to Cramer from the rest of the sector, which has been largely under pressure from changing shopping trends. J. Jill is a clothing brand targeting 40- to 65-year old women that uses data to drive its sales and has affluent, loyal customers. However it is growing fast—an "outlier" compared to other retailers, Cramer said. But the challenging retail environment could dampen the success of the stock, which by most recent number trades at 24 times earnings, a huge premium to competitors like Gap. "I think J. Jill could have tremendous potential, but given the horrific backdrop, I think it might be too soon to ﻿give the stock my blessing," Cramer said. "But you wouldn't be crazy for wanting to speculate on it." Cramer pointed to two brands that have overcome the struggle thanks to strong management and focused long-term strategies. "Children's Place and Foot Locker have both been able to triumph at a time when most retailers are struggling to stay afloat, and I think these two stocks could have even more room to run," he said. Carlos Barria | Reuters Janet Yellen Cramer also turned his attention to the future of technology, stating that autonomous driving could be the biggest opportunity in the tech space. "Anyone who can get a piece of this market is going to do incredibly well, and anyone who can dominate it is going to coin money," Cramer said. Intel took a step into dominating the space with its $15 billion purchase of Mobileye on Monday, an Israeli manufacturer and leading player in advanced driver assistance systems. However, the market didn't respond positively to the deal, sending Intel's stock down more than 2 percent. Cramer stated that indicated a short-term perspective of the stock, as the acquisition could break Intel out of the view that it is a maker of PCs, and prompt Wall Street to pay more for the stock. US Concrete's stock is up more than 40 percent since the election, but CEO Bill Sandbrook says this has nothing to do with President Trump's victory in the White House. "Things are good right now, and this has nothing to do with the Trump infrastructure bill," Sandbrook said. Instead, Sandbrook attributed the strength of infrastructure to the underlying building economy. He confirmed strength in all four of US Concrete's major markets in San Francisco, Dallas, Washington D.C., and the Northern New Jersey and metro New York areas. In the lightning round, Cramer gave his take on a few stocks from callers: Exxon Mobil: "I think you should wait until it gets to a 4 percent yield. It's at 3.68. We'll get Wednesday, we'll get high inventory numbers. Maybe Exxon breaks $80 and then you can pull the trigger. I want you to get in at the right price. It does matter." Sonic Drive-In: "I like Sonic too. And, you know, when we have [CEO] Cliff Hudson on, I think, 'terrific.' But here's the problem. Right now, going out, dining, restaurant[s], all bad. So we've got to be very, very careful. Can't push that one very aggressively, even though at $23 it's very cheap."

Jose Moreno, 82, disappeared around 5 a.m. from the 700 block of Easy Street, which is the neighborhood off of Lovett Road and Russell Lane behind Walmart. This evening San Benito Police Chief Michael Galvan announced Moreno was discovered by his family walking by a nearby resaca. Galvan said Moreno, who suffers from dementia is in good health and doing fine. Earlier today police said they'd searched the wooded areas and the resaca that borders Moreno's neighborhood. Police also distributed flyers to other law enforcement agencies and area businesses. The chief was worried the elderly man may have received a ride and left the immediate area.

The store, built in 2005, is 3 miles from the Cabela’s location in Woodbury. (Submitted photo: CoStar) Outlook on Gander Mountain real estate could be dim By: Clare Kennedy March 13, 2017 2:14 pm 0 Selling off some of the assets of St. Paul-based Gander Mountain may be a slog, said one expert on the retail market, but various city officials are not worried that the company’s soon-to-be vacant stores will become white elephants. The outdoor sporting goods retailer announced on Friday that it had voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and would close 32 underperforming stores out of its more than 162 locations across the nation, according to a news release. The three Minnesota stores due to be shuttered are in Woodbury, Rogers and Mankato. Gander Mountain is currently seeking a buyer, which it hopes will take on the whole business and its real estate. An auction for the company will be held in late April 2017, the company said, with the expectation of closing the sale by May 15. Some of its stores, like Woodbury, are company-owned. Others are leased. Selling off the whole business is an unlikely outcome, however, said Dave Brennan, a professor of marketing at the University of St. Thomas’ Opus College of Business. Most of the would-be buyers are just fighting to keep their heads above water. “For the last three or four years, actual dollar sales in sporting goods has declined in terms of the absolute amount,” said Brennan, co-director of the university’s Institute for Retailing Excellence. “Along with that, [the major sports retailers] continued to ramp up development of new sporting goods stores and now a lot of them are heavy on debt.” Gander was no exception. “They expanded very aggressively into Texas and other Southern areas. To succeed in a new market a retailer has to build a foundation with customers, but also have good distribution centers nearby,” Brennan said. “They didn’t get the customer traction they were hoping for and the logistical complications posed by their distribution centers didn’t help. They did too much, too fast, in too many places.” Almost all of Gander’s competitors – Cabela’s, Bass Pro Shops (Cabela’s new owner), and the now-defunct Sports Authority — made the same mistakes Gander did, Brennan said. Now the market for bricks-and-mortar sporting goods stores is saturated, Brennan said, and the industry is feeling increasingly pinched by the growth of online sales and an aggressive push into the segment by other retailers like Wal-Mart, which has made a concerted effort to expand its sporting goods selection. At present, Gander Mountain’s 162 stores are in 27 states, according to its website. Gander spokesperson Jess Myers declined to provide further detail as to how and when the company would dispose of its soon-to-be vacant properties, or if more closures were on the horizon. It’s a large portfolio, and it will most likely be picked apart and sold piecemeal, Brennan said. The most likely suitor would be Dick’s Sporting Goods, a Coraopolis, Pennsylvania-based company. However, Dick’s already went on a bit of a buying spree, picking up Sports Authority locations, Brennan said, and is probably not well-positioned to take on more. There are a few regional sports retailers on the East and West coasts that could be potential buyers, but so far none of them has expressed interest in expanding into the states between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. “That depends on whether they’re interested in picking up stores outside their primary areas. If they did, they would probably rather do it incrementally,” Brennan said. Gander is also unlikely to be able to sell to bricks-and-mortar retailers outside the sporting goods segment, Brennan said. Clothing stores, like Gordmans, and electronics sellers like Radio Shack are also going under. “We’ve seen four large retailers file for bankruptcy within the last two weeks, and numerous companies are closing stores,” Brennan said. “Staples, Crocs, Sears, J.C. Penney – the list just goes on and on. It’s a tough time for store-based retailers.” In any case, Gander’s empire will likely be dispersed through a series of real estate transactions, a cluster here, and a cluster there. Nevertheless, city officials in Woodbury, Rogers and Mankato believe that suitors will soon come out of the woodwork to buy or occupy vacant Gander stores in their towns. “We have had a couple retailers that have gone through the same type of process and we have had good success [finding new uses for their locations],” said Dwight Picha, community development director at the city of Woodbury, which has both Gander Mountain and Cabela’s stores. The two both front on Interstate 94, and are just 3 miles apart. “We have very little retail vacancy in our market here and very little land available to develop additional retail, so I’m confident some user will come along.” He added that the city did not plan to take an active role in helping Gander find a new occupant for the store it owns at 10470 Hudson Road. The market value for the store, built in 2005, is nearly $5.7 million, according to CoStar data. “The marketplace will take care of it,” Picha said. City officials believe the same is true in Rogers, where Gander’s store at 20870 Rogers Drive sits just off Interstate 94. “This property is well-positioned to backfill due to its excellent visibility, high traffic volumes (96,000 vehicles per day) and the city’s sizable daytime population,” said Rogers City Administrator Steve Stahmer. The Gander Mountain store in Rogers is also close to a Cabela’s location, which is less than a mile away. The Gander building is owned by New York City-based DRA Advisors. Minus the three stores slated for closure, Gander has nine other stores in Minnesota, and two in the border cities of Fargo, North Dakota and La Crosse, Wisconsin.

In that time, I’ve come to learn that I’m good at one kind of investing: finding future blue-chip stocks. So what exactly am I looking for in these future blue-chip stocks to buy? I want stocks with a history of strong earnings, revenue and dividend growth. Simply put, I have seen the incredible gains in stocks like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and McDonald’s Corporation (MCD) when compounded over 30-plus years. Yes, I realize buying some of the stocks on our list today will not provide the outsize rewards that Walmart and McDonald’s have. But I would rather sacrifice some of that upside in favor of stocks with a proven track record, consistent business and promising future. These blue-chip stocks include some names you probably know, and some you don’t. Most of them already boast strong business growth, but what we want to see from here is a management focus on growing the dividend. Eventually, you can expect these stocks to provide significant income in addition to at least modest growth in the future. I will be the first to admit, these future blue-chip stocks are not cheap, especially after the post-election rally. But premium stocks come with a premium valuation. That’s why you can’t buy blindly. My suggestion? Write each of these stocks down, then wait for the broader market pullback that is more than due after such a rip-roaring run. Then, monitor each one for a 10% to 20% retreat from current prices, and when that happens … buy! Without further ado, here’s a look at seven future blue-chip stocks to buy. Prices and data are from the original InvestorPlace story published on March 9, 2017. Click on ticker-symbol links in each slide for current prices and more.

In late February, we detailed the robustly growing dividend of this eventual blue-chip stock. Since 2010, the company’s lowest dividend increase was “only” 17.6%. While Starbucks has only paid a dividend for seven years, its growing business and iconic brand add to its attractiveness. Starbucks has showed a remarkable ability to improve earnings, revenue and same-store sales. Investors can only put so much stock in estimates; still, analysts expect the company to grow earnings by 15.5% per year over the next five years. Further, SBUX said it expects 10% annual sales growth and earnings growth of 15% to 20% over the next five years. Even if Starbucks falls short, these are still some impressive growth figures for such a big company. SBUX has a big runway in China and is a consistent cash-cow in the U.S. That growth combined with strong dividend growth makes this a future blue-chip stock.

(NKE). The two stocks trade with a near-identical stock price and relatively close market caps. Over the past five years, SBUX stock has returned 135%, slightly more than Nike’s 109%. In any regard, both of these stocks have been big winners. But they’re more than that, as both are prime candidates to be future blue-chip stocks. Like Starbucks, Nike should have relatively strong earnings growth. Analysts expect five-year average earnings growth of 12.1%. Management estimates it will generate about $50 billion in revenue in 2020, up big from last year’s $32.4 billion figure. While sales and earnings growth have admittedly taken a dip at Nike, there’s another catalyst in the dividend. The last time Nike failed to raise its dividend by double-digits came in 2009, when it increased by 9.7%. Notably, this came right in the depths of the Great Recession, a time where Nike still raised its dividend. Nike’s stock valuation is close to the bottom of its five-year range, and it’s still down notably from the highs. A pullback below $55 would make this a future blue-chip stock to buy.

(V). After its rally, Visa now sports a market cap north of $200 billion. That may not seem like a stock with a lot of upside to some. But consider the limits many people considered 30 years ago. Surely, they didn’t suspect there would be numerous stocks sporting $500 billion market caps. Or that iPhones or self-driving cars would exist. I would say Visa’s toll-booth-like business and the move toward credit and debit from cash and check ensures it will be around for plenty of decades to come. And in that time, Visa is unlikely to get smaller. Either is its bottom line. Earnings are expected to grow by 15.9% per year for the next five years. Sales are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 10.4% from 2016’s final results. Importantly, Visa is no slouch when it comes to its dividend, either. Visa’s lowest dividend increase since coming public in 2008 is “just” 16.6%. Management’s focus on the dividend shows that decades of growth should lead to a strong payout down the road. The yield may be small now, just 0.75%, but that figure is sure to grow.

(MA) right behind it. MasterCard and Visa complete the duopoly in the payments world. While their businesses are not invincible (think recessions) the long-term outlook remains very bright. Trends toward credit and debit from cash and check help. But the trend toward online shopping is also a big win for companies like Visa and MasterCard. Analysts expect MasterCard to grow earnings by 13% this year and 16.4% next year. For the next five years, estimates call for annual earnings growth of 14.9%. As for its dividend growth, it has slowed each year over the past six years. But — and this is a big but — its payout growth has been in the double digits each year. For years, the company paid the same dividend to shareholders. But in 2012 and 2013, it doubled the payout figure and has continually increased it each year after. Year Quarterly Dividend Dividend Growth 2012 $0.03 100% 2013 $0.06 100% 2014 $0.11 83% 2015 $0.16 45.50% 2016 $0.19 18.75% 2017 $0.22 15.70% While MasterCard’s dividend may have started off quite low, management’s focus on growth over the past six years is promising for the future.

Smith     Nvdongen via Wikimedia (Modified) Most names on the future blue-chip stocks to buy list sport big market caps. But there are some smaller names too, like A. O. Smith Corp. (AOS). For those unfamiliar with this $8.5 billion market cap company, it manufacturers water heaters, boilers and commercial water heating equipment. However, it also operates in the water-treatment business as well. The past five years have shown one thing: Consistency. And analysts expect more of it too. Estimates call for 12.4% earnings growth this year, 9.6% next year and 11.5% over the next five years. Revenue is expected to grow 8.8% this year and 8% next year. The dividend has been impressive as well. A. O. Smith has paid a dividend since the late-1980s. It was lowered in the early 1990s, but has been steadily growing since 1999. Lately, it has been more impressive, though. A. O. Smith not only paid a dividend all through the Great Recession, but it also raised its payout. This year’s raise made it seven consecutive years with double-digit dividend growth as well. The smallest hike in that span came in at 16.6%. Management’s rekindled focus on the dividend, coupled with A. O. Smith’s consistent business, make this a future blue-chip stock to buy.

(ROP) also falls in the future blue-chip stocks to buy group. With a $21 billion-plus market cap and plenty of growth, this technology company is on the radar screen. Roper has gotten off to a robust 2017, tacking on 15% to its stock price so far. Over the last five years, it’s up a whopping 125%. But there could be more gains in sight. Analysts expect the company’s next five years of earnings to grow 14.75% annually. Revenue is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 8.1% over the next five years. Its dividend is a thing of beauty. Despite Roper’s 0.66% yield, the dividend may trump all the other future blue-chip stocks. The company has paid a dividend since going public in 1992 and has never lowered the payout. Over the past 10 years, Roper has grown its dividend by double-digits each year — and yes, that includes through the Great Recession.

(DIS) is another behemoth, weighing in with a market cap of $173 billion. Finding future blue-chip stocks with a small market cap is nice, but there also tends to be more risk. Thus the ticket to success may be to find a balance by mixing stocks such as A. O. Smith and Disney. Many investors may bring up ESPN as a big concern for Disney. It’s two-year stock performance of just 6.4% shows that concern front and center. But this overshadows many of Disney’s qualities and past performance. Investors forget the stock is up a whopping 160% over the past five years alone. Management has made key acquisitions that have provided the company with important assets and cash flows. Disney has had a big run, but with its focus on high-quality entertainment, it’s sure to be a staple in millions of households for decades to come. Management’s focus on the dividend is equally rewarding. Through the Great Recession, Disney didn’t raise its dividend. On the positive side, though, it also didn’t reduce or cut the dividend either. Starting in 2010, the company went on a multi-year streak where the dividend grew by double-digits for six straight years. Last year’s raise of just 8.8% broke that streak. It will be important to see if Disney can get back on track with a double-digit increase in 2017. This article is by Bret Kenwell of InvestorPlace. As of this writing, he held a long position in SBUX, NKE, V and MA.

"Following" : "Follow"}} March 13, 2017 3:01pm   Comments Share: Related DG Mid-Afternoon Market Update: Oracle Gains On Earnings Beat; TrovaGene Shares Slide Dollar General Higher In Volatile Session After Lower Guidance Dollar General Corp's (DG) CEO Todd Vasos on Q4 2016 Results - Earnings Call Transcript (Seeking Alpha) Dollar General Corp. (NYSE: DG) will report its fourth quarter earnings on Thursday. Investors will focus on comps, commentary about initiatives in pricing, investments and 2017 store opening plans. Q4 Expectations Michael Lasser of UBS believes Dollar General’s top-line remained stable, but sluggish in the fourth quarter. Lasser expects an EPS of $1.43, slightly ahead of the consensus estimate of $1.42. The analyst projects a 0.5 percent comp, slightly ahead of the consensus view of 0.3 percent. Lasser, who reiterated his Buy rating, said the fourth quarter comp could have been pressured by 150-175 bps again this quarter following Wal-Mart's aggressive posture and competitive flare ups in certain markets, SNAP and deflation. As such, the analyst sees a 55 bp gross margin decline in the fourth quarter and expects comp growth to remain under pressure for the next couple of quarters. That said, the analyst is bullish on the stock, saying Dollar General's earnings algorithm is achievable and compelling. “Sustaining 10%-15% annual EPS growth through a visible formula that hinges on 6%-8% square footage increases, modest comp growth, stable to increasing margins, and 5% reductions to shares outstanding should be handsomely rewarded by the market,” Lasser highlighted. Price Investments Looking ahead, one of the key debates on Dollar General is how much more price investment is needed to compete with the rest of consumables retail.  Lasser said surgical price reductions in selected additional markets may be necessary in the current environment. “For every 10% of stores they make price investments in, it would drive 10-20 bps of GM pressure, all else being equal. Though, we think its sales will improve,” Lasser wrote in a note. For FY2017, Lasser expects EPS of $4.61 (vs. cons. of $4.69) and comp of 1.4 percent and -40 bps of operating margin contraction. What Loop Capital Expects Meanwhile, Loop Capital’s Anthony Chukumba remains Hold-rated on Dollar General ahead of its earnings. Chukumba’s fourth quarter and F2017 EPS estimates of $1.39 and $4.73 are $0.02 below and $0.05 above consensus, respectively. Chukumba, who expects the company to provide a “high-level” guidance for the full year, expects a 0.4 percent increase in the fourth quarter same-store sales and a 100-bps gross margin decline. To become more positive on the stock, the analyst is looking for sequential improvement in same-store sales, food price deflation and better-than-expected profitability. Chukumba is waiting for a better entry point to become more constructive on the shares. Lasser has a price target of $85, while Chukumba has a target price of $76.

(WKRN) – A 7-year-old girl was critically injured after being shot in the face when two cars were hit by gunfire on Interstate 24 Saturday night. It happened in the westbound lanes of I-24 near the Hickory Hollow Parkway exit at 10:40 p.m. According to witnesses, the gunman fired shots while hanging outside the front passenger window. A passenger in one of the cars says they were driving home from a Walmart in Smyrna when they heard several booming noises. They didn’t realize what happened at first, but they pulled over when they saw that 7-year-old Kayla Velazquez, who was sitting in the backseat, was injured. The child was struck by a round that hit her in the cheek and then exited through her nose. She was transported to Vanderbilt Children’s Hospital with critical injures. She was released from the hospital on Sunday. The occupants of the second car hit by bullets included a couple and their 8-month-old baby. They were not hurt. According to police, none of the victims reported any type of incident before the shooting. The suspected vehicle was described by Metro police as a white Ford four-door sedan. Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers at 615-74-CRIME.

Sections Deseret NewsUtah Utah About Utah: Utah cowboy explains 'the top 1 percent love what we do' By Lee BensonDeseret News Published: March 12, 2017 4:00 p.m. Updated: March 13, 2017 12:20 p.m. 6 Comments 1 of 14 View 14 Items Clark Knight Danna Burns-Shaw is a fifth-generation Burns owner. PARK CITY — There ain’t much about the Burns Cowboy Shop on Main Street that screams Old West. Not when belt buckles can go for a grand, boots for three grand and hat bands for five grand. The other day a saddle went out the door for 50 grand. An unsuspecting customer walked in recently, looked around, and brought a belt to the counter. The clerk rang up the purchase: $4,995. “Wait, what?” said the customer, “I thought it was $49.95.” He had failed to notice the comma. “Happens all the time,” says Danna Burns with a sympathetic smile. Better than anyone, she knows the Burns Cowboy Shop was never intended to be for everyone. “The top 1 percent love what we do,” she explains, noting, by way of example, the current eight-month waiting list for a high-end authentic Burns custom-built saddle. “‘Largest selection, lowest price’ used to be the company slogan. That worked really well for us — until it didn’t.” • • • The truth is, all appearances aside, the Burns Cowboy Shop is about as Old West as they come — the latest chapter in a family story of resilience that would make anyone who lives by the creed “cowboy up” stand up tall in the saddle and applaud. The Burns have remained in business for 141 straight years precisely because whenever the world turns they turn with it. They have survived recessions and the Great Depression, the invention of the automobile, two world wars, the decline of the American cowboy, computerization, Y2K and Wal-Mart. Every single time it looked like they were finished, they weren’t. Let’s review the history: • In 1876, Miles Burns, whose mother crossed the plains to get to Utah, opened a harness shop in the central Utah town of Loa. • In 1898, facing a declining clientele in Loa, Miles’ son Vivian put the business on logs, moved it 50 miles north to Salina and invented saddle pack bags that were adopted by the U.S. government for use with its cavalry horses. • In 1940, with horses becoming more and more obsolete, Viv’s son Vern invented the Pik Pocket, a collapsible storage pouch that snapped onto the springs on the back of the seat of a pickup truck. • In 1962, after car and truck manufacturers covered the seat springs, Vern’s son Dan invented Indian blanket seat covers. • Which brings us to Danna Burns Shaw, Dan’s daughter, who, when faced with the recession of 2007, had the idea to move the Burns brand into what she calls the “resort arena,” creating a line of designer boots, clothing, hats, bags, accessories — even exotic leather-covered cellphone cases — all of it targeting high-end customers who are willing to spend thousands so they can look like a worn-out old cowboy. Sure, it was a gamble when Danna, her husband Scott and oldest son Braydan went the upscale route. And sure, they continued to keep their business in Salina alive, where there are still honest-to-goodness cowboys who buy their traditional, and more affordable, line of boots, saddles, bridles, buckles and harnesses. But they couldn’t have called themselves Burnses if they hadn’t gone for it. Certainly no one was willing to face Miles, Viv, Vern or Dan when they got to the other side and tell them they hadn’t. Ten years down the road, it appears the resort reinvention was yet another good idea. Park City has given the Burns family a nice new niche and identity, allowing them to open a second Burns Cowboy Shop in Carmel, California, which is also thriving. (They opened another high-end store in Newport Beach, but had to shut it down for lack of business. “Leather needs weather,” sighs Danna). 6 comments on this story “We’ve always been merchants,” says Danna, who lives in Carmel and runs the shop there, leaving day-to-day management of the Park City store to Braydan, while other members of the sixth generation operate Burns Saddlery, the manufacturing and retail complex in Salina, as well as yet another Burns Cowboy Shop in Lehi. “We represent the spirit of the West — to seek a better life,” says Danna. “We always have and hopefully always will. “The family slogan is, ‘You’re either green and growing or ripe and rotting.’ You’ve constantly got to find your green. With each generation, everybody’s had to find their own.” Like that? Read this.

The company announced that more than 17,000 employees in South Carolina – more than 4,000 in the Myrtle Beach/Florence area – got a bonus along with an annual pay raise in their March 9 paycheck.

Workers in the Myrtle Beach/Florence area split a part of over $3.4 million in bonuses paid to South Carolina workers. “Our associates’ hard work makes the difference in our stores’ performance,” said Sean Real, regional manager of Wal-Mart’s South Carolina stores, in a press release. “The quarterly bonus is one way we’re thanking our associates and sharing in the success together.” Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Business Suggested for you Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:59 Myrtle Beach weather forecast for 3.14 Pause 1:16 Gun charges dropped against man paralyzed in Myrtle Beach drug raid 3:56 21 recipients honored with Presidential Medal of Freedom 2:28 Patrick Carroll of Dirty Don's Oyster Bar & Grill in Myrtle Beach shows off "Patrick's Painkiller" | Hot Pour 0:12 Body recovered from Highland, IL, lake 0:32 Baby pulled from car that went into lake 1:55 Residents weigh in on school board's proposed raises 0:51 Children fleeing fatal fire, reflection of flames, caught on surveillance video 0:47 Car-sized sea creature surprises South Carolina fishermen 0:29 Fire badly damages home on Dogwood Lane in Glen Carbon; coroner called Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 5 months ago Myrtle Beach International Airport upgrades radar technology 0:41 5 months ago Myrtle Beach International Airport upgrades radar technology 3:12 10 months ago What is National Small Business Week? 6:41 a year ago Amid allegations, Founders Group president talks View more video Business See what property is selling for in the Myrtle Beach area Your governments invested millions, but the land is almost empty US women's hockey players stand firm in wage fight New Mexico students rally at Capitol for education funding Trump aides, daughter, meet with Hispanic business owners Editor's Choice Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions e-Edition Home Delivery Vacation Hold Report a Delivery Error Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us FAQ RSS Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter YouTube Mobile Apps & E Reader Text Alerts Newsletters Advertising Place a Classified Advertise Rates Contests & Promotions Shopping Local Deals Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions e-Edition Home Delivery Vacation Hold Report a Delivery Error Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us FAQ RSS Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter YouTube Mobile Apps & E Reader Text Alerts Newsletters Advertising Place a Classified Advertise Rates Contests & Promotions Shopping Local Deals More Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service

A $2,000 investment in Amazon two decades ago would have made you a millionaire -- but that doesn’t mean that it’s too late to buy this multi-bagger stock. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Mar 13, 2017 at 1:32PM Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) went public in 1997 at $18 per share. A $2,000 investment would have been enough to buy 111 shares, and those shares would have split to 1,332 shares today -- which would be worth over $1.13 million. That explosive growth made Amazon one of the greatest multi-bagger growth stories of the past two decades. Yet Amazon continues to grow, soaring 50% over the past 12 months and lifting its market cap past $400 billion. Image source: Amazon. But after those big gains, investors might be wondering if it's too late to buy shares of this millionaire-maker stock. I believe it isn't, for six simple reasons. 1. Its valuations are still reasonable A common bearish argument against Amazon is that the stock looks too "expensive" at 174 times earnings. However, that view ignores Amazon's impressive earnings growth rate. Amazon grew its earnings per share by 292% in 2016, compared to 140% growth in 2015 and a net loss in 2014. Analysts expect Amazon's earnings to rise 49% this year and 75% next year. Based on those estimates, Amazon trades at just 67 times forward earnings -- which is reasonable relative to its growth rates. 2. AWS is just getting started Amazon's key profit driver over the past few quarters has been AWS (Amazon Web Services), the largest cloud platform in the world. That platform lends out storage space, computing power, and software development platforms to massive customers like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), NASA, and the CDC. Last quarter, AWS revenue rose 47% annually and accounted for 8% of Amazon's top line. However, AWS' operating income rose 60% and brought in 52% of the company's operating profits thanks to its higher margins. That profit growth gives Amazon more freedom to expand its lower-margin marketplace businesses. 3. The Prime ecosystem is still expanding A key part of that marketplace push is Prime, Amazon's prisoner-taking membership ecosystem which offers discounts, free shipping, e-books, streaming video, cloud storage, and other perks. The expansion of that ecosystem puts a lot of pressure on brick-and-mortar rivals like Wal-Mart and streaming video players like Netflix. Last October, eMarketer estimated that Amazon Video was adding users at a faster rate than both YouTube and Netflix. And last June, research firm CIRP estimated that Amazon's Prime customer base in the U.S. grew 19 million year-over-year to 63 million -- indicating that Prime shoppers outnumbered non-Prime shoppers. The study also found that Prime members spent about $1,200 annually on the site, compared to just $500 for non-members. 4. Its home automation ecosystem will grow Amazon is also expanding its Prime ecosystem into homes with cheap connected consumer electronic devices like the Kindle tablets, Fire TV set-top boxes, Echo family of smart speakers, Dash buttons, and DRS-enabled appliances. Image source: Amazon. Amazon has also taken steps to connect its Alexa voice assistant to other functions in smart homes and connected cars. Smart light bulbs, fans, thermostats, and locks already sync to Alexa and Echo. Amazon has also worked with Ford to sync newer vehicles to Alexa so users can control smart home devices from their cars or access their vehicles from inside the home. All these services help Amazon gather more data about its users' habits and reduces the friction in online purchases -- which gradually increases customer dependence on its services. 5. International growth opportunities Amazon's international marketplace business generated just a third of its revenues last quarter. That's why the company is expanding into new overseas markets like India, where it invested billions to challenge market leader Flipkart; and China, where it remains far behind market leaders Tmall and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD). Like Netflix, Amazon is launching localized original content for Amazon Video in overseas markets. These new streaming shows, like Kamen Rider Amazons and an Ultraman Orb spinoff in Japan, help the company localize its brand and expand its Prime ecosystem. 6. Logistics costs will decline Lastly, Amazon's closely watched logistics expenses will eventually fall with increased automation. We've already seen Amazon make progress here with thousands of warehouse robots and its own fleet of cargo planes, and its upcoming Prime Air drone deliveries could greatly reduce delivery costs further. Some skeptics might believe that widespread drone deliveries might not be feasible, but JD.com already launched "thousands" of delivery drones across rural China last November. The company stated that the test run, which was conducted during the massive Singles Day rush, went "smoothly." The key takeaway It's highly unlikely that Amazon can ever repeat its near 55,000% post-IPO rally. However, that doesn't mean that it's too late to get in on this millionaire-maker stock. I personally bought my shares when Amazon was in the low $600s, when many analysts called the stock expensive. The skeptics are still saying the same thing about the stock now, in the mid $800s, but I believe that it still has plenty of room to run. Leo Sun owns shares of Amazon and Ford.

Charged is Christopher McKenna, 33, of Port Murray in Mansfield Township. Police said McKenna was driving a black Subaru at 10:23 a.m. Friday when a witness saw him jump a curb at Route 517 and Route 46, hit a street sign and keep going. Man steals from ShopRite, returns items to Wal-Mart, cops say McKenna ended up leaving a hubcap and part of the vehicle's bumper behind. Officers searched the area and found a vehicle matching the description along Sharp Street. N.J. man allegedly hides under bed to avoid arrest Police then found McKenna trying to repair a tire on the passenger side. An officer detected the odor of alcohol while talking to McKenna, police said. McKenna is charged with drunken driving, drunken driving in a school zone, refusal to submit a breath test, failure to report an accident, leaving the scene of an accident, reckless driving and other traffic violations.

News Business Business News Asda offers 135,000 staff pay rise in exchange for 'flexible' contracts The supermarket  will pay those workers who sign the new contract £8.50 an hour from October this year, above the current wage of £7.44 and £1 more than the £7.50 National Living Wage Zlata Rodionova Tuesday 14 March 2017 07:46 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Asda claims hat 95 per cent of current employees will be better off if they move to the new deal iStock Asda has offered a pay rise to its 135,000 employees if they sign a new “flexible “contract which will introduce a requirement to be available to work during bank holidays and not to be paid for breaks. The supermarket group will pay those workers who sign the new contract £8.50 an hour from October this year, above the current wage of £7.44 and £1 more than the £7.50 National Living Wage rate due to come into force in April.  The contract is voluntary, said Asda, which is owned by US retail giant Walmart, predicting, however, that 95 per cent of current employees will be better off if they move to the new deal. Read more Lidl becomes first supermarket to pay workers Living Wage If they chose not to, their base rate will move up to the minimum national rate of £7.50 an hour in April and they will retain their existing contract. In Monday’s release, Asda also maintained its on-going commitment  not to use zero-hour contracts, under which the employer is not obliged to provide a minimum number of hours of work.  Read more Workers with learning disabilities deserve equal pay Argos fined £1.5m for paying less than the minimum wage Asda will be selling 'free-range' milk starting from tomorrow Asda waters down Prosecco with Pinot Grigio to cut costs However, the new agreement also means that employees must work on bank holidays if the store requires them or chose to take days out of their 28 days of annual leave. Staff who opt into the new contracts will also move to unpaid breaks, Asda said, and employees working night shifts will be paid extra for anti-social hours between midnight and 5am. That’s a reduction from the current window of 10pm until 6am, but the extra pay or premium rate for those times will rise from £2.04 to £2.54 an hour. “Our current employment contracts have evolved over decades. They mean we have different colleagues on different terms and they don’t give our colleagues the level of flexibility our customers need to meet their changing needs,“ Hayley Tatum, Asda’s senior vice president of people, said. “This new contract will also mean that colleagues can gain a broader level of experience across their store, which will in turn give them better opportunities to progress and develop their career in retail,” she added. The new contracts have also been approved by the GMB union.

The new contract offer involves quite a few changes, but as it’s voluntary, this allows colleagues to choose whatever suits their circumstances best,” Tim Roache, GMB’s General Secretary, said. Michael Hibbs, employment law partner at Shakespeare Martineau, said: "It is likely that this type of flexible contract will not suit everyone, but, the voluntary nature of the arrangement at this stage will give employees the option." "However, whether Asda will put some gentle pressure on employees is of course not clear at this stage."  More about: Asda National Minimum Wage Living wage Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

The rating for Walmart U.S. improved in 2017 from a 64% rating in 2016.

By Bill KnightRetired WIU Journalism Professor In the classic movie “Casablanca,” French Captain Louis Renault is ordered by occupying Nazis to close down Rick’s Café Americain and contrives an excuse, saying, “I'm shocked – shocked – to find that gambling is going on in here!” as a dealer hands the collaborator his own winnings.. The federal government seems similarly hypocritical as the Senate and a host of agencies look at Caterpillar and hundreds of other multinational corporations based in the United States when they exploit laws and loopholes approved by Congress. Caterpillar failed to pay taxes on billions of dollars of profits brought home mostly from a Swiss subsidiary, CSARL, thereby failing to follow U.S. financial reporting rules and tax laws, according to a report commissioned by the federal government disclosed by the New York Times last week. That might explain the March 2 raid on Cat’s World Headquarters in Peoria, plus offices in East Peoria and Morton, where agents from the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Commerce Department took part. However, the practice isn’t unusual. About $2.5 trillion has been held offshore in about 10,000 tax-haven subsidiaries by more than 350 of Fortune-500 companies, according to another report, “Offshore Shell Games 2016,” from the Public Interest Research Group, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, and Citizens for Tax Justice. Companies such as Apple and General Motors, Proctor & Gamble and Wal-Mart did so, as well as 33 companies based in Illinois, including Allstate, ADM, Boeing, Exelon, McDonald’s, Motorola Solutions, Navistar, Sears Holdings, State Farm and Walgreens, says the 58-page report, which notes that among Illinois companies, Cat has the third highest amount of profits held offshore. Cat has held $17 billion in 69 tax-haven subsidiaries in Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Channel Islands, Costa Rica, Hong Kong, Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Panama and Singapore as well as Switzerland, “Offshore Shell Games 2016” reports. The government’s interest in Cat’s situation dates to 2014, when a U.S. Senate subcommittee concluded that it cut some $2.4 billion in taxes over about 13 years. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the corporation’s auditor, reportedly helped set up the process in 1999, when almost $8 billion in profits started being moved overseas, writes Dartmouth College accounting professor Leslie Robinson in the government report. There’s a disconnect when it’s standard practice for multinational corporations to operate differently that individuals or smaller companies. “Corporate lobbyists and their congressional allies have riddled the U.S. tax code with loopholes and exceptions that enable tax attorneys and corporate accountants to book U.S. earned profits to subsidiaries located in offshore tax haven countries with minimal or no taxes,” “Offshore Shell Games 2016” states. U.S. companies owe corporate income taxes at a rate of 35 percent on profits earned around the world. However, they’re permitted to defer taxes owed on profits generated offshore until they bring those earnings back to the States, known as repatriation. Once they do, they generally owe federal income taxes, with credit for any income taxes they paid overseas. “Many U.S. companies game this system by using loopholes that allow them to disguise profits earned in the U.S. as ‘foreign’ profits earned by subsidiaries in a tax haven,” the independent report says. Cat’s defended the strategy as lawful, but the IRS is already seeking $2 billion in taxes and penalties, which Cat is appealing, and no charges have been filed by the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of Illinois. But inside the company, some objected to the practice.  Daniel Schlicksup in 2009 filed suit and accused Caterpillar of breaking the law and misleading stockholders. (The case was reportedly settled out of court.) And last month, shareholder Judy Pill sued, accusing Cat of violating its “fiduciary duties.” Lawyers say corporations’ fiduciary responsibilities include Obedience to officers and directors’  duties, Loyalty to the corporation and its shareholder, Diligence in acting in the interests of the corporation, Disclosure to shareholders, officers and directors, and Fair dealing in good faith and honesty. Robinson’s report says Cat engaged in tax and accounting fraud. “I believe that the company’s noncompliance with these rules was deliberate and primarily with the intention of maintaining a higher share price,” she writes. “These actions were fraudulent rather than negligent.” Congress could restores fairness by ending incentives to shift profits and jobs offshore, increasing transparency, and closing loopholes. “Corporate tax avoidance is not inevitable,” the independent report says. “Congress could act tomorrow. By failing to take action, our elected officials tacitly approve the fact that when corporations don’t pay what they owe, ordinary Americans inevitably must make up the difference.” Contact Bill at Bill.Knight@hotmail.com; his twice-weekly columns are archived at billknightcolumn.blogspot.com About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Contact Us Western Illinois Family Magazine Online Forms Archives Submit News Weather Coupons Advertise With Us Market Place Regional Classifieds Illinois Auctions Classifieds Place An Ad Cars Boats Magazine Schools Info Canton Schools Cuba Schools Lewistown Schools Spoon River Valley Schools Schools Info Public Notice Illinois Farmington Schools VIT Schools Astoria Schools Avon Schools Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Police said two cars were struck by gunfire near Hickory Hollow Parkway in Antioch around 10:45 p.m. Kayla Velazquez, 7, was sitting in the rear passenger seat and was hit by a round that entered her cheek and exited her nose. She was transported to Vanderbilt University Medical Center with critical injuries. The three other people in the car were not injured. One of the passengers told police that they were driving home from Walmart in Smyrna when they heard multiple booming noises. When they realized the child had been struck, they pulled over and contacted police. Another vehicle was also struck by a round in the driver’s side but none of the three occupants, which included a couple and their 8-month-old baby, were harmed. According to witnesses, the gunman fired shots while hanging outside the front passenger window of an older model white Ford sedan. Neither of the victims in either vehicles reported any incidents prior to the gunfire. Velazquez is now considered to be in stable condition. Anyone who has information about the shooting is urged to contact the Emergency Communications center at 615-862-8600 or Crime Stoppers at 615-742-7463.  Callers to Crime Stoppers can remain anonymous and qualify for a cash reward.

(Michael Reynolds / EPA) Steven PearlsteinThe Washington Post If President Donald Trump was surprised by how complicated health care could be, he'll be in for a real shock when he gets around to business tax reform. Everyone agrees that the way the United States taxes business profits needs an overhaul. The current tax regime encourages companies to move operations, assets and even corporate citizenship overseas, while raising less and less money every year as companies come up with ever more ingenious and ethically questionable ways to avoid it. For most big companies, the official 35 percent corporate tax rate is irrelevant. The average rate actually paid is about 24 percent, with some companies routinely paying no tax at all. So why have three presidents and countless Congresses been unable to fix it? The answer is that despite all the bellyaching by business leaders about our uncompetitive tax system, it is the business lobby itself that has stood in the way of reform. The reason is simple: To restructure the tax code while still raising the same amount of revenue, all those companies paying less than the average effective rate would have to pay more so those paying uncompetitive rates could pay less. And the low-tax companies have made it their business to prevent that from happening. Now, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, R-Wis., and his Ways and Means chairman, Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, are determined to try again, proposing to replace the existing business profits tax with a "destination-based cash flow tax. " The wonky-sounding idea — long championed by economist Alan Auerbach of the University of California at Berkeley — has been kicking around in tax policy circles for more than 20 years, winning plaudits from think tanks on the right and left. Despite what you may have read, it is not part of a Republican conspiracy to eliminate taxes on capital. It is not a disguised tariff, or sales tax or value-added tax, although it would mimic their economic impact in some respects. It would not raise the price of imports by anywhere near 20 percent, nor would it bring millions of manufacturing jobs back to the United States. So what is it? Let's start with the "cash flow" part, which has received too little attention. What that means is that companies would deduct the full value of any investments they make in the year they make them, rather than spreading them out — or depreciating them — over many years, as now required by tax and accounting rules. It also means that interest payments used to finance those investments could no longer be deducted as a business expense. This switch from a profits tax to a cash-flow tax makes things simpler, encourages investment and eliminates the incentive for businesses to borrow rather than raise capital from investors. This is the part of the Ryan-Brady plan that economists love and most businesses support because of the way it simplifies business taxation and removes taxes as a factor in business investment decisions. In the short run, it also reduces the amount of profits that are subject to tax. More controversial is the "destination" part of "destination-based tax flow tax." What that means is that companies will be taxed only on profits from sales made in the United States. Consider four different scenarios. The first is an American company producing goods or services at home and selling them to American customers. That's a big chunk of the economy, and the tax structure for those companies would remain largely unchanged. Then there are sales from overseas divisions of American companies to customers who are also overseas. Right now, profits from these transactions are not subject to U.S. tax as long as they are left overseas. A destination tax would ignore them as well. Then there are sales of goods and services produced in America but sold to customers overseas — think Boeing. Under the destination tax, the overseas sales would not be counted as revenue, but the expense of producing them would still be deducted as a business expense in calculating the company's taxable profit. That's the tax equivalent of all gain, no pain. And the opposite would be true of a company that imports products, or parts of products, for sale in America — think Walmart or Nike. In that case, the revenue will be counted, but the cost of the imported goods or services will not. All pain, no gain. By lowering taxes for exporters and raising them for importers, this "border adjustment" is meant to remove the current incentive for companies to locate production and intellectual property, or realize profits, in tax havens such as Ireland or the Bahamas. As a result — and this is what gets Trump all excited — jobs would come back, tax revenue would increase and the trade deficit would disappear. Or not. For if those good things actually happen, or even look like they are about to happen, then something else might also happen — namely, that the value of the dollar would rise sharply against other currencies, which for Americans will lower the price of imports and makes exports seem more expensive to buyers overseas. Economic theory, in fact, predicts that the dollar would rise just enough to offset the new tax advantage that would flow to exporters as a result of a border adjustment, and offset the tax hit to importers and their customers. What the new tax code giveth in terms of higher or lower taxes, the currency exchange market would taketh away in the form of lower or higher prices. If economic theory is right, in other words, the only lasting economic impact of border adjustment impact might be a nasty global financial crisis as some foreign countries and companies that borrowed cheap dollars would find themselves unable to repay more expensive ones. In addition, as the dollar rises, the value of foreign investments held by Americans would fall, while foreigners' appetite for investing in the United States would wane, potentially depressing stock prices and pushing up interest rates. While economists are fairly united in predicting that border adjustment will lead to an equal and opposite currency adjustment, business executives aren't so sure. That's why importers have mounted a furious effort to kill the Ryan-Brady plan, while exporters are pushing it with the urgent conviction of new converts at a tent revival. Officials in the Trump administration are said to be similarly divided. There is good reason to be skeptical that global markets are so efficient that the dollar will rise to offset the economic impact of the border tax. If markets were that efficient, currency adjustments would have prevented the United States from running large and persistent trade deficits all these years. The reason that didn't happen was because the flow of investment capital across borders is even greater than the flow of goods and services, with an opposite effect on the dollar exchange rate. The same dynamic could limit the rise of the dollar in response to a border-adjustment tax. Whatever happens with the dollar, border adjustment will put an end to ridiculous and costly shell games played by virtually every global corporation to shift activity and profits overseas, where nearly $2 trillion sits idle in the bank accounts of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies. Other countries will almost certainly mount legal challenges to border adjustment, claiming that it violates global and bilateral tax treaties. But there is also a possibility that other countries could realize what a good idea it is and copy it. That would neutralize some of the economic benefits to the U.S. economy. There is debate about whether the Ryan-Brady proposal would shift the burden of the corporate tax from shareholders and employees to consumers, which would make it less progressive. Liberal economists such as Jared Bernstein think so, but Kyle Pomerleau at the conservative Tax Foundation thinks not. In the end, it would depend on how much the dollar adjusts and whether importers would be able to pass tax increases on to consumers rather than to their shareholders and employees. In other words, it's anyone's guess — although either way, the effect will probably be modest. For me, the problem with the Republican business tax plan is not so much the structure of the tax, but the fact that the proposed 20 percent rate is too low. As Howard Gleckman of the Tax Policy Center has written, if border adjustment increases exports and discourages imports to the degree promised by some proponents, then the 20 percent tax rate will not raise anything close to what the corporate tax raises now. Edward Kleinbard, a tax expert at the University of Southern California law school, figures a rate of 25 percent would be needed for the plan to be revenue neutral. William Gale of the Brookings Institution thinks it would be 30 percent. "The 20 percent rate is not economically driven," Kleinbard said. "It's purely a political number." The House plan also retains the current tax advantage enjoyed by small businesses, partnerships, proprietorships, investment trusts and limited liability corporations — enterprises that, as a result of this tax advantage, account for half of all business profits. Such enterprises — some of which are very large and very profitable — are not subject to either the corporate tax or to the additional 20 percent tax on dividends and capital gains that corporate shareholders pay. Instead, they are taxed only once at the personal income tax rate of the owners. The House proposal would expand this boondoggle by creating a special new tax rate of 25 percent for these "pass-throughs" — a rate that is not only undeservedly low but will create a whole new tax scam, as highly paid employees rush to turn themselves into independent contractors to take advantage of it. Because of these and myriad other problems, the Ryan and Brady proposal needs lots more study and debate — it shouldn't be rushed through to meet artificial political deadlines. But by the same token, it deserves serious consideration. "I'm very intrigued by it, particularly the economic benefits," said Martin Sullivan, the respected columnist and chief economist at Tax Notes. "There are concerns with it, no question. But the reason we are still talking about it is that there is no obvious alternative." Washington Post Steven Pearlstein is a Post business and economics writer.

A seven-year old child was shot in the face and two cars hit in the Saturday night incident, which happened around 10:45. NewsChannel 5 reports Kayla Velazquez was hit in face while sitting in the backseat of the vehicle. On their way back from Smyrna, the family reported hearing two loud booms and pulled over when realizing their child had been shot. Velazquez was taken to Vanderbilt's Monroe Carroll Jr. Children's Hospital. The bullet entered her cheek and exited through her nose. She's reportedly in stable condition. The other vehicle hit was a family and their eight-month old baby. No one in that vehicle was injured. The shooter was reportedly hanging out of the front passenger window of an older, white Ford four-door car, when firing the shots. Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 615-742-7463.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady JPMorgan Chase purchases CurrentC, looks to develop technology for further use Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Monday, March 13th, 2017, 05:07 Category: Apple Pay, Finance, iOS, News, retail If you were curious as to what happened to CurrentC, the intended mobile payment service that was intended to compete with Apple Pay a few years ago, there’s an answer: JPMorgan bought it out. Oddly enough, Chase Bank played both sides and was one of a few major banks to partner with Apple when Apple Pay launched back in the fall of 2014, but several retailers including CVS and Walmart blocked or denied plans to accept Apple Pay due to an upcoming CurrentC app and commitments to MCX, the company developing CurrentC. Some CurrentC backers including Rite Aid and Best Buy eventually changed their course and added Apple Pay as a payment option in stores, and last summer efforts to bring CurrentC to market finally ended. Chase currently remains an Apple Pay backer, although its in-house payment service, knows as “Chase Pay”, is based on MCX technology. Although CurrentC is dead, JPMorgan Chase says it has acquired MCX to help bring Chase Pay to more retailers. MCX’s members were already connected to MCX payments technology, which made it seamless to connect to Chase Pay. Chase executives wanted to acquire the technology to use in lieu of building separate parallel technology to serve non-MCX members. At present, only a few retailers currently accept CurrentC, especially given its QR code-based payment option. Best Buy and Starbucks, for example, accept both Apple Pay and were launch partners for Chase Pay, while JPMorgan Chase says Walmart, Shell, or other MCX members will start accepting Chase Pay in the future. As always, stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

These days, a host of major companies are trying to get into the internet TV game. Netflix was certainly a major market leader early on, but now there are companies like Sony, Amazon, Google, and Apple all fighting for a piece of the online entertainment pie. Unfortunately, because it’s so competitive and because so many people are scouring the web for both streaming and live TV content 6 Ways to Watch Live TV on Windows 8 6 Ways to Watch Live TV on Windows 8 With the release of Windows 8, several apps have come along that make enjoying TV on your computer much easier. The following apps are all free from the Windows 8 Store. Read More , there are also lots of scams. There are sites that promise free TV or movies, but then infect your computer with a virus or malware the moment you download a file that you think is a movie. There are also sites that promise “live TV,” but actually offer nothing more than streaming content from other major video streaming sites like YouTube. Your best option is to avoid all of that nonsense. What you’ll find below is a comprehensive list of sites and services for watching TV on your computer over the internet. Behold! How to Watch TV on Your Computer With so many options for watching TV online, it’s hard to know where to begin. So, the best place to start if you want to immediately dive into streaming TV content right away is with the big three that everyone knows and loves — Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon. Netflix: Because You’ve Always Used It There’s a reason Netflix became the king of streaming. People are lazy, essentially. Stores like Blockbuster and small video-rental places let people walk in and pay to rent DVDs. Netflix was one of the first Is Netflix Worth The Money? Is Netflix Worth The Money? There are more people who don't subscribe to Netflix as those who do, and that swathe of the population wants to know if they're missing out on anything. Is Netflix worth the money? Read More companies to capitalize on the internet for the same purpose. The benefit was that regardless of the weather, the consumer could rent a movie without ever leaving home. It all started with a mail-order DVD rental business, but then grew into the online streaming behemoth we know today. You Have to Love Hulu Then there was Hulu. For a long time, Hulu was the go-to place for people looking for free, high-quality TV content. At the free end of the site, you could find old episodes of shows Hulu: Watch Favorite TV Show Episodes Online Hulu: Watch Favorite TV Show Episodes Online Read More that you haven’t seen in years. On the paid side of things, you could find a growing library of movies and more recent TV episodes.  Hulu eventually converted its free offerings Hulu's Free Streaming Option Is Shutting Down Soon Hulu's Free Streaming Option Is Shutting Down Soon Hulu's free streaming option is coming to an end, but it's not the end of the world yet. Here's how you can keep watching that free content elsewhere. Read More into a joint venture with Yahoo! called Yahoo View. Today, if you want to get true TV content online, a Hulu subscription is one of the few places where you can watch the current seasons of popular TV shows. Hulu is also the place to find recent hit movies, and even some original series. If you’re considering completely cutting cable for good, a Hulu subscription will go a long way in making sure you don’t live to regret the decision. Pay as You Go With Amazon Amazon is the last of the “big three”, but it’s a bit different than the previous two. While Netflix and Hulu give you full access to all of their content for a fixed monthly subscription fee, Amazon takes more of an a la carte approach to digital entertainment. A “Prime” membership is potentially the cheapest subscription of the three big video streaming services – only $99-per-year, or $10-a-month if you pay monthly. There’s certainly plenty of free content available to stream with a Prime membership, but for the most part these are really low-ranked movies 7 Places To Find Free Movie Rentals Online 7 Places To Find Free Movie Rentals Online Going to the movies is expensive, so save money on the cinema by renting for free at home instead. Here's 9 sites and ideas to check out. Read More and very old TV episodes most people won’t care to watch. That isn’t to say you can’t find some great stuff to watch within the free Prime library, but for the more recent or higher quality movies or TV shows, you’re going to have to cough up anywhere from $2.99- to $19.99-per-rental. If you only watch a couple of movies each week, that still isn’t a whole lot of money. But if you’re a TV fanatic who loves to binge on the latest TV shows and movies every single night, Hulu or Netflix are probably better suited for you. With that said, the world of streaming movie and television content Canceled Cable? 8 Streaming TV Apps to Fill the Void Canceled Cable? 8 Streaming TV Apps to Fill the Void If you have canceled cable you may be wondering what to watch next. These streaming TV apps may be the answer, as they offer a traditional viewing experience. Read More over the internet to your computer has exploded by leaps and bounds. These “big three” are no longer the only options. Some might even say, they are no longer the best options either. Other Ways to Watch TV Online Whenever anything becomes popular, every company large or small tries to jump into the game. This is most certainly the case when it comes to streaming entertainment on the internet. Watching TV With Walmart? The American company, Vudu, started out offering its own devices and a proprietary peer-to-peer technology where people could use to stream TV and movies over the internet to an actual television. In March of 2010, Walmart acquired the company. The hardware is no longer supported, as the Vudu service has shifted to offering a library of thousands of movies and TV series for streaming to third-party hardware, computers, or mobile devices. Vudu’s pricing for individual video rentals is competitive with Amazon’s pricing structure, with the added competitive advantage that there’s absolutely no membership fee for signing up with Vudu. You simply pay for whatever you watch. The movie selection at Vudu is just as plentiful as Amazon’s library, without many of the one or two-star “free” movies you’ll find at Amazon that nobody cares to watch anyway. Speaking of which, Vudu has a free section as well called “Movies On Us”, where anyone can choose from a selection of hundreds of free movies or TV-shows Vudu Offers 1,000+ Free Movies On Us Vudu Offers 1,000+ Free Movies On Us Vudu has launched a new offering called Vudu Movies On Us. This lets you watch thousands of movies and television shows for free with "limited commercials". Read More . The only catch is that they also come with ads. Not a bad compromise considering many of these selections are really good movies and TV shows. If your main goal here is only to watch the most recent TV shows you’re interested in, Vudu is a good place to turn. There are families that pay well over $150-a-month for a cable subscription and really only watch two or three of their favorite shows each week. By using a subscription-free service Yes, You CAN Watch TV Online Legally & For Free Yes, You CAN Watch TV Online Legally & For Free Whether you’re thinking of cutting the cord or just want to watch TV on your own schedule instead of the television network’s, there are more legal ways to watch television online than ever. Even better,... Read More like Vudu instead and simply buying the shows you want to see (like an entire season of The Walking Dead in SD for only $26.99), you can save a lot of money every month. Xfinity Doesn’t Care What Device You Use This isn’t to say that all cable companies are evil Netflix Vs Cable Companies - Who Is More Likely To Win? Netflix Vs Cable Companies - Who Is More Likely To Win? Netflix is a growing force in the entertainment world, but broadcast and cable television have been around for a long time, and they didn’t achieve that success by playing fair. Read More . The reality of the world today is that everyone in every family likes to watch television in whatever way is most convenient for them. In any given household, you may have: Dad laying on the couch in the living room and watching The Walking Dead on the TV. Mom working on the computer in her office and watching The Voice on her laptop. Big sister lounging on her bed after school and watching Deadpool on her smartphone. Little brother watching an episode of Spongebob Squarepants on his tablet in the basement. Comcast caught onto this trend and through their Xfinity brand, are quickly expanding their entertainment offering to include internet-based media streaming services. The service offered to all of their customers is called Xfinity Stream. This service allows customers to choose from a collection of popular (and recent) TV series and movies that are just as bursting at the seams as Netflix’s collection. In fact, I’m currently catching up on the latest episodes of The Voice using Xfinity Stream while writing this article. iTunes and Google Play Did you think this list was over? Not even close. Those big companies getting into the entertainment streaming business include Apple and Google. Both companies also provide digital content streaming through their iTunes and Google Play services, respectively. On iTunes, you’ll notice two categories – TV Shows and Movies The Easy Way To Automatically Add Downloaded Movies To iTunes [Mac] The Easy Way To Automatically Add Downloaded Movies To iTunes [Mac] Read More . Prices for both movies and TV episodes are comparable to other services like Amazon and Vudu, but of course you get the added benefit of quick access to iTunes from all your Apple devices. On Google Play, there is a Movies & TV section where you can similarly buy and stream both movies and TV episodes Watching Offline Movies From Google Play? You CAN Do That On A Chromebook!

Today we take a look at one area where a lot of people still harbour many misconceptions about Chromebooks - offline movie playback. Read More to your Android (and other Google) devices. Prices are generally equivalent to iTunes prices, but again the benefit of using this service is how quick and easy it is to access all of your favorite entertainment straight from your Android mobile devices. Fast, easy, and with no subscription required. Best Buy: Don’t Buy. Stream. You know Best Buy is the first place you go when you want to browse laptops or digital video cameras, right? Well, did you know that Best Buy now also offers an subscription-free online digital streaming experience called CinemaNow? CinemaNow is Best Buy’s foray into the digital entertainment marketplace. It includes an impressive collection of not only old and new TV episodes, but also documentaries, season downloads of your favorite network shows, and a giant library of just about any movie you can think of. As far as pricing goes, many of the more popular or recent movies are only available as full-download purchases, while other movies are available for one-time rental fees at a fraction of the cost.  Thankfully there is also a “New Rentals” category, if you’re more interested in cheaper one-time rentals. The selection of rentals isn’t bad – but most of the best movies are only available here at full purchase prices. Fandango Streams TV? Fandango has been around for a long time as one of the internet’s most popular movie review sites. Now the site is also the place you may want to go to watch movies as well. The streaming service is called Fandango Now. Prices at Fandango Now Think Fandango Is Just For Checking Movie Showtimes? Think Again [iPhone] Think Fandango Is Just For Checking Movie Showtimes? Think Again [iPhone] Are you a movie buff? If so, you probably like to keep up with all the latest happenings in the movie world at all times. You want all of that critical information about what is... Read More  seem pretty close to Amazon’s prices, but of course without the annoying Amazon Prime subscription fee. The beauty of a service like Fandango Now is that it’s such an inexpensive alternative to paying over $100 for a monthly cable subscription. You can easily find a new hit TV series like Mars, and purchase the entire season for $9.99 (in Standard Definition). Some TV series, like Game of Thrones for example, will cost upwards of $27.99 for an entire season. But considering an entire season is 15 to 20 episodes, you’re looking at almost a month’s worth of nightly entertainment for a fraction of the cost of cable. The real secret to saving as much as possible on your digital entertainment is to shop around. For example, the movie The Road is only available as a $9.99 purchase on CinemaNow and Google Play, but it’s included as part of a Netflix subscription. Start out by thinking about what you want to watch, and then check all of the available streaming services for the best possible price, before you buy. How to Watch TV Online for Free It may seem like all of the digital streaming services out there are now offering some form of pay-only option, but you don’t always have to cough up money to watch great TV or movies. If you have a favorite TV show, the first place you should always check is the website of the network running the show. Often you can watch each new episode of a show merely a day or two after the show airs on TV. The following are some of the most popular network stations that let you watch streamed episodes of their most popular shows for free Free to Watch: 1st Episodes of Amazon's Original TV Shows Free to Watch: 1st Episodes of Amazon's Original TV Shows Did you know that Amazon produces original TV series?

NBC ABC PBS FOX Discovery There are still also some decent free video streaming sites available online Crackle: Watch Free Full Length Movies & TV shows Crackle: Watch Free Full Length Movies & TV shows Read More . The content there is not quite as varied or recent as some of the options listed above, but there’s still some great entertainment to be found there. Crackle – Older shows and movies LinkTV – Colorful and cultural shows produced by LinkTV YouTube – YouTube has more free video content than any other site out there As an honorable mention, the following sites offer subscription access to multiple channels of online content. YouTube Movies – Premium movie rentals, some as cheap as $0.99 SlingTV – Digital streaming service similar to Xfinity Stream, but starting at $20-per-month instead of a cable subscription. PlayStation Vue – For as little as $29.99-per-month, get access to major live TV networks. DirecTV Now – For as little as $35-per-month, you can watch live TV, and for a little more watch some premium channels as well. Still Have Cable? Why? These days, with so much amazing content available on the internet at prices much lower than any cable subscription, it really doesn’t make sense for anyone to remain bound to a cable box. You’ve got options to watch just about any movie or TV show your heart desires. So, what are you waiting for? Which streaming service(s) do you use to watch your favorite movies or TV shows? Do you have a particular favorite or do you use several? Please share your thoughts with us on this topic in the comments section below!

Definitely going to my bookmarks. Reply FancastFan December 30, 2008 at 9:25 pm Ryan, just to note your response to Mike, while Fancast certainly has shows from NBC and Fox (the parent companies of Hulu, hence the logo on some of the videos) it ALSO has full-length programs from ABC, CBS, Viacom cable nets like Comedy Central, and other outlets like The WB - in fact, every major network and studio, including pay channels like HBO, Showtime and Starz. And old classics too from the golden age of sit-coms (which usually means CBS). Maybe you can note that? Cheers, Jim (for fancast) Reply Kevin December 30, 2008 at 8:12 pm I'm pretty sure that Tom & Jerry has never been on Nick. I went on the site and it showed Flinstones, and Spongebob was on on my TV. Went to Cartoon Network and it showed some old show I vaguely remember seeing on TV several years ago. Inner-Live is more like Inner-5 Years. I WANT MY CARTOONS! >:C Reply Ryan Dube December 30, 2008 at 5:50 pm Mike - thanks for your comment. Did you notice that Fancast has the Hulu logo at the top of their videos for the full length TV episodes? Reply Mike December 30, 2008 at 3:49 pm Not all cable companies are oblivious to Internet TV. Comcast, for instance, took the initiative to launch Fancast, which you don't list here and which is a better site than half of the ones you've got listed, IMO.

DevOps unites the entire enterprise in delivering business transformation with superior customer experience. Companies like Target, Capital One, Walmart, ING, Nordstrom, Netflix and JetBlue are already reaping the benefits. In order to unlock the promise of DevOps, CIOs must lead the call for cultural change. As any leader knows, changing institutionalized behavior is the toughest of all management challenges and CIOs are understandably skeptical of new trends.  Despite this, CIOs must recognize when a trend becomes an imperative for survival. DevOps has become this imperative, and CIOs must act now. CIOs who embrace the DevOps challenge must first fostera culture of collaboration and learning, then enable their people with the right tools to drive holistic life-cycle automation. Those who meet this challenge won’t just beat their competitors — they will decimate them. Effective DevOps requires the fusion of dev and ops, into teams that are product (or solution) based.  Product teams will own the complete product life cycle.  This reorganization resolves the issue of automation only taking place within technology silos.

But customers (mostly) don't care Posted: Monday, March 13, 2017 6:51 AM EDT Updated: Monday, March 13, 2017 8:52 AM EDT An Associated Press-GFK poll in 2016 found nearly 75% want to buy American. But their first preference is to buy the cheaper item. By Heather Long NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Cathy Paraggio always checks the labels on stuff she buys: Is it made in China? Vietnam? Bangladesh? Mexico? Or America? She was a big believer in the "Made in the USA" movement long before President Trump started telling the nation to "Buy American and hire American." In 2012, Paraggio launched a male swimsuit brand called NoNetz. It makes swimsuits that prevent chafing and rashes. Paraggio vowed to make the suits in the U.S. She found a textile factory in Brooklyn, MCM Enterprise, that could do the work. There was just one problem: The suit cost $23 to make in Brooklyn. Making it in China and shipping it to Paraggio's office cost a mere $10. Manufacturing in America "makes me look like a bad business person," Paraggio told CNNMoney. She went with the Brooklyn option anyway. Surely, she thought, customers would prefer to see the "Made in the USA" label. That's not what happened. "No one cares about Made in the USA," says Praggio, who recently ordered some suits from China for the first time after Daymond John of Shark Tank gave her frank advice to get real about the bottom line. So she placed the order. And cried. Trump preaches "Buy American" often. He mentioned it in his Inaugural Address. He brought it up in his first prime-time speech to Congress (watched by over 47 million people). He made it a campaign issue. But the largest obstacle to Trump's vision may be the American shopper, who is constantly on the lookout for a good deal. Americans care most about price In survey after survey, Americans say they prefer to buy "Made in the USA" products. But when it comes to actually spending, their choices tell a different story. "Consumers are all for Made in America until they have to pay for it," says Greg Portell, partner at consulting firm A.T. Kearney who specializing in advising retailers. People have grown accustomed to cheap prices after years of shopping at discount retailers like Walmart and Target. In general, they only buy American if it doesn't cost much more than the product from China or Germany or Bangladesh. Paraggio saw this trend first-hand in her business. She gets two frequent comments from customers: They love the product, but why does it cost so much? An Associated Press-GFK poll last year found nearly 75% want to buy American. But their first preference is to buy the cheaper item. The Boston Consulting Group, which has studied the issue for years, found it's a bit more complicated. When people go to the store, they also consider quality. Eighty-five percent of U.S. consumers think American-made products are better quality than those made overseas, BCG found. And they are willing to pay a premium for some products that are Made in the USA. For baby formula they'll pay a lot more. For shoes, they won't. "Clothing is one of the things that is very hard to reshore. It's a tough road to go," says Hal Sirkin, a senior partner at BCG. Overall, BCG estimates companies can charge up to about 5% more for American-made. Businesses react to the bottom line Trump certainly understands this labor math. Some of his own clothing line is made in China. Chung Yu owns the factory in Brooklyn where Paraggio has been manufacturing the NoNetz swimsuits. He's been in garment-making for 35 years, but he's worried about staying in business at a time when New York has raised the minimum wage. It New York City, employers who have a staff of 11 or more, have to pay $11 an hour. That will go up to $15 an hour by the end of 2018. "In China, it's $2 or $3 an hour. And even China is getting too expensive. Retailers are switching to countries like Bangladesh," Yu explains. Yu's factory is still pretty busy, but it's almost all small orders of about 300 items or less. Most of his clients are small businesses like NoNetz. As soon as they hit a certain scale, they typically jump overseas for production. "People think Made in America is better quality, but that's not true," Yu says, frankly. "It all depends on the quality of the machines and labor." Yu won't say who he voted for, but he says thanks to Trump, everyone in his world is talking about "American made" again. "When we hear how Trump will bring manufacturing back, we're excited," Yu told CNNMoney. "But we have to see how he will implement it." What could come back to the U.S. There's a lot of debate about whether Trump can bring manufacturing, let alone manufacturing jobs, back to the United States. Robots and automation have also taken some (if not a large part -- Ball State University says 88% of manufacturing job losses come from automation) of the jobs. Experts say it's going to take more than a "buy American" promotional campaign to make it to happen. The research BCG has done suggests that some industries are more ripe to come back to the U.S. than others. The reality is wages have been rising in China and elsewhere in the world, making it less attractive to make certain products there. "Computers and appliances are at a tipping point," Sirkin says. "We've seen manufacturing costs overseas go up for those industries." Clothing, however, is one of the least likely processes to return, BCG found. "How could you possibly buy shorts for $5 and have it made here. You absolutely can't. I've tried," laments Paraggio. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Last month, Tyson Foods announced a “no antibiotics ever” pledge for all Tyson-branded chicken products, building on an earlier promise to restrict drug use on broiler chickens. Analysts see the latest Tyson announcement as further evidence of a trend of large companies limiting pharmaceuticals that scientists believe increases drug-resistance for treating pneumonia, infections and other illnesses in humans. The wave started in 2014 with Perdue Chicken and chicken-based fast-food chain Chick-fil-A, followed by McDonald’s, Wal-Mart Stores, Pilgrim’s Pride and others. The announcements vary in scope, with some companies, for example, still permitting use of ionophores, antibiotics not used in human medicine. The shift follows warnings about antibiotic resistance from health officials and a September 2016 United Nations General Assembly resolution that pledged coordinated action to address overuse. “We’re seeing a cry from consumers for meat that’s responsibly raised,” said Lena Brook, a food policy advocate for the Natural Resources Defence Council (NRDC). Still, the breadth of the movement should not be overstated. While an estimated 40 to 50 per cent of US chicken now is antibiotic-free, the percentage is far lower for pork and beef. Moreover, several leading companies have resisted action. Kentucky Fried Chicken, part of Yum Brands, currently scores an “F” on an NRDC scorecard on antibiotics policy, while Sanderson Farms, a leading US chicken producer, has lampooned the trend. “There’s certainly strong and growing demand for it today, but to what extent it’s a fad or a long-term trend remains to be seen,” said Zain Akbari, a food industry analyst at Morningstar. Antibiotic-free premium Experts in animal farm science say US farmers for decades routinely employed antibiotics as a means to speed growth rates for animals, and to prevent disease outbreaks on farms where animals are frequently packed in close quarters. But an April 2014 World Health Organisation report warned of the potential for a “post-antibiotic era” in which “common infections and minor injuries can kill” as drugs become ineffective. In voluntary guidelines that took effect in January, the US Food and Drug Administration said antibiotics in agriculture should be limited to medically necessary uses and not for weight gain. The call by public officials has dovetailed with heightened consciousness about food in broader American society that has also propelled organic food. Instead of antibiotics, Tyson is turning to probiotics and to botanicals such as oregano and thyme for routine treatment, while still employing antibiotics if birds become sick, a spokesman said. Tyson, which has faced shareholder resolutions in recent years on its water policy and other sustainability issues, also plans to limit antibiotics in pork, beef and turkey, although it has not yet set target dates. “We’re eliminating human antibiotics because it’s the most responsible approach to balance a global health concern and animal well-being,” a Tyson spokesman told AFP. “Antibiotics resistance is a very complex issue with no single cause and no single solution. It’s a global concern and we want to be part of the solution.” As other companies have done, Tyson began with chicken, in part because chicken farms tend to be vertically organised within companies, compared with pork and beef, which involve contracts with outside farmers. That means the company would need to institute programmes that impact its suppliers, analysts say. Is beef next? Advocates of stricter antibiotic use are pressing for action on beef and pork too, and are preparing a shareholder resolution for McDonald’s annual meeting. Since beef already has more premium grades, adding antibiotic-free products could be another opportunity to introduce a pricier product, said Akbari, the Morningstar analyst. Akbari said much of the current push is in response to millennials, who increasingly will “force retailers and producers to be pretty nimble.” Still, organic-minded millennials are not the only key segment in the vast US food market. Sanderson Farms last summer unveiled a marketing blitz in which a pair of folksy, baseball-cap wearing consumers mock the antibiotic-free craze in television ads that question the scientific link of agriculture to the growth of drug resistance and the wisdom of paying more for antibiotic-free chicken. Joe Sanderson, chief executive of the 62-year-old Mississippi company, defended the company’s stance in a February 23 conference call. “Everybody does not want that product,” Sanderson said. “And everybody does not believe the claims on that product and nor is that claim important to everybody.” — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week 'Billion tree tsunami' surges across northern Pakistan New arts centre to open in Dubai's Culture Village in 2018 Colossus found in Egypt may have depicted Psammetich I Superflex to undertake site-specific commission at Tate Modern Tour the National Gallery's 'Australia's Impressionists' Curry puff-shaped sofa scores major hit at furniture expo Hungry Japanese teen finds curry restaurant closed, decides to set it on fire instead The professor-dad who went very, very viral after his kids barged into TV interview (VIDEO) From adventurers to inventors, Saudi women unite to inspire new generation BBC interview dad laments online fame (VIDEO) Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Related Articles Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Image: luoman/Istock.com via AFP Relaxnews Facing pressure from environmentalists and shareholder activists, major food companies and restaurant chains in the United States are moving to limit antibiotics in farm animals raised for meat. Last month, Tyson Foods announced a “no antibiotics ever” pledge for all Tyson-branded chicken products, building on an earlier promise to restrict drug use on broiler chickens. Analysts see the latest Tyson announcement as further evidence of a trend of large companies limiting pharmaceuticals that scientists believe increases drug-resistance for treating pneumonia, infections and other illnesses in humans. ADVERTISEMENT The wave started in 2014 with Perdue Chicken and chicken-based fast-food chain Chick-fil-A, followed by McDonald’s, Wal-Mart stores, Pilgrim’s Pride and others. The announcements vary in scope, with some companies, for example, still permitting use of ionophores, which are antibiotics not used in human medicine. The shift follows warnings about antibiotic resistance from health officials and a September 2016 United Nations General Assembly resolution that pledged coordinated action to address overuse. “We’re seeing a cry from consumers for meat that’s responsibly raised,” said Lena Brook, a food policy advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). Still, the breadth of the movement should not be overstated. While an estimated 40 to 50 percent of U.S. chicken now is antibiotic-free, the percentage is far lower for pork and beef. Moreover, several leading companies have resisted action. Kentucky Fried Chicken, part of Yum Brands, currently scores an “F” on an NRDC scorecard on antibiotics policy, while Sanderson Farms, a leading U.S. chicken producer, has lampooned the trend. “There’s certainly strong and growing demand for it today, but to what extent it’s a fad or a long-term trend remains to be seen,” said Zain Akbari, a food industry analyst at Morningstar. Antibiotic-free premium Experts in animal farm science say U.S. farmers for decades routinely employed antibiotics as a means to speed growth rates for animals, and to prevent disease outbreaks on farms where animals are frequently packed in close quarters. But an April 2014 World Health Organization report warned of the potential for a “post-antibiotic era” in which “common infections and minor injuries can kill” as drugs become ineffective. In voluntary guidelines that took effect in January, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said antibiotics in agriculture should be limited to medically necessary uses and not for weight gain. The call by public officials has dovetailed with heightened consciousness about food in broader American society that has also propelled organic food. Instead of antibiotics, Tyson is turning to probiotics and to botanicals such as oregano and thyme for routine treatment, while still employing antibiotics if birds become sick, a spokesman said. Tyson, which has faced shareholder resolutions in recent years on its water policy and other sustainability issues, also plans to limit antibiotics in pork, beef and turkey, although it has not yet set target dates. “We’re eliminating human antibiotics because it’s the most responsible approach to balance a global health concern and animal well-being,” a Tyson spokesman told AFP. “Antibiotics resistance is a very complex issue with no single cause and no single solution. It’s a global concern and we want to be part of the solution.” As other companies have done, Tyson began with chicken, in part because chicken farms tend to be vertically organized within companies, compared with pork and beef which involve contracts with outside farmers. That means the company would need to institute programs that impact its suppliers, analysts say. Is beef next? Advocates of stricter antibiotic use are pressing for action on beef and pork too, and are preparing a shareholder resolution for McDonald’s annual meeting. Since beef already has more premium grades, adding antibiotic-free products could be another opportunity to introduce a pricier product, said Akbari, the Morningstar analyst. Akbari said much of the current push is in response to millennials, who increasingly will “force retailers and producers to be pretty nimble.” Still, organic-minded millennials are not the only key segment in the vast U.S. food market. Sanderson Farms last summer unveiled a marketing blitz in which a pair of folksy, baseball-cap wearing consumers mock the antibiotic-free craze in television ads that question the scientific link of agriculture to the growth of drug resistance and the wisdom of paying more for antibiotic-free chicken. Joe Sanderson, chief executive of the 62-year-old Mississippi company, defended the company’s stance in a February 23 conference call. “Everybody does not want that product,” Sanderson said. “And everybody does not believe the claims on that product and nor is that claim important to everybody.” JB play_circle_filled Panelo calls impeachment rap vs Duterte ‘black propaganda’ March 16, 2017 play_circle_filled Solon files 1st impeachment rap vs Duterte March 16, 2017 play_circle_filled Pacquiao tells Drilon: Use your common sense March 15, 2017 play_circle_filled Aguirre gets docs on ‘corrupt’ activities in Pagcor, flawed SOCEs March 15, 2017 TAGS: antibiotics, antibiotics for animals, Fast food, Food, poultry, US food market For feedback, complaints, or inquiries, contact us.

The... March 13, 2017 March 13, 2017 Two West African women, one Gambian national, and the other a Senegalese, have said that they witnessed the arrest of the two missing Gambian Americans Alhagie Mamut Ceesay, and Ebou Jobe, the Freedom Newspaper can reveal. The incident happened on June 22nd 2013, just outside the outskirt of the luxurious Coconut hotel, after the duo had given ride to the two ladies, following a dinner at the “Terroubi Bar and Restaurant.” Mr. Ceesay, a resident of Austin Texas, and Jobe, a New Yorker Gambian resident, were forcefully taken into custody by guards led by one Michael Correa. Fatou Sarr, is a Gambian. She now lives in Finland. She is married to a Finish national. She tells Freedom Radio Gambia, in an exclusive interview that she met Alhagie Mamut Ceesay, and Ebou Jobe at the “Terroubi Bar and Restaurant”, on the night of their abduction by the Gambian security agents. She was under the company of her Senegalese friend and visitor Jiela Nying. Ms. Nying was six months pregnant at the time. While at the Bar, Ms. Sarr, said Ceesay and Jobe invited them for a drink. The two Gambian Americans even bought stake (“Africa”) for them. Mr. Ceesay was wearing brown shirt and a jean, while his friend Ebou Jobe, a former Walmart manager, was dressed in a white t shirt that night. Michael Correa, a former member of dictator Yahya Jammeh’s constituted assassin team, was standing at the Bar while closely watching Ms. Sarr, Ms. Nyng, Mr. Ceesay and Mr. Jobe. Ms. Sarr was even alarmed by Mr. Correa’s suspicious behavior at the Bar. He drew the attention of Ceesay and Jobe about Michael’s suspicious behavior. Just in time, a Bakau, girl, who goes with the first name Amiecolleh, arrived at the restaurant. She accosted Ms. Sarr’s guest Ms. Nying. She accuses Ms. Nying of blocking her way. She then physically attacked her, leading to an altercation between the two. They were later separated by the restaurant’s patrons. Amiecolleh, threatens to attack Ms. Nying on her way home. Concerned by Amiecolleh’s threats against Ms. Nying, Fatou Sarr, said Alhagie Mamut Ceesay, then offered to give them a ride home. They later left the Bar, and boarded Alhagie’s rented vehicle. Ebou Jobe was on board the car at the material time.  When Mr. Ceesay drove past the Coconut restaurant, he made a stopover to a nearby gas station to buy gas. Unfortunately, the gas station was closed for business. Alhagie Mamut Ceesay proceeded with Fatou Sarr, Ms. Nying and Ebou Jobe. They got stopped by soldiers mounting checkpoint few minutes away from the gas station. Masked soldiers emerged from the grassy hideout to join the soldiers on roadblock.  Micheal Correa, who was spotted at the Bar, happens to be the leader commanding the arresting team. Both Mr. Alahgie Mamut Ceesay and Ebou Jobe were forcefully arrested, and handcuffed, Fatou Sarr said. They were later escorted into a waiting unnumbered vehicle, and whisked away to an unknown destination. Fatou Sarr and her pregnant Senegalese friend were later taken into a waiting vehicle, where they were sexually molested. The soldiers forcefully kissed them and threatened to kill them. “ Michaela Correa, and his colleagues were dead drunk. They asked us if we know the two arrested men: Alhagie Mamut Ceesay and Ebou Jobe. We lied to them that we do not know them. We told them that we just met at the bar. They would have killed us if we had confirm knowing them. I met Alhagie Mamut Ceesay in 2012, when he visited the Gambia. He told me that he was staying in Brikama at the time. He wanted me to help him to rent a car. I met him during his second trip in 2013 at the “Terroubi Bar and Restaurant.” That night the late Musa Ngum and his son Yusupha Ngum, were performing at the Restaurant. Both him and Ebou Jobe, met Mr. Ngum after he finished performing,” she said. “Michael Correa, and his colleagues forcefully kissed us. He told his colleagues that he has long been trying to date me, but I refused. My friend Jiela Nying, had no ID at the time. She was virtually unconscious due to the harassment we suffered in the hands of Correa and his men. They later drove us back to where Mr. Ceesay and Jobe, were arrested and asked us if we have money to pay for a taxi, and I responded in the affirmative. Our cell phones were earlier seized, but was later returned to us. Michael Correa warned me not to disclose what we witnessed. He said he is going to kill me if I ever divulge the arrest of Alhagie Mamut Ceesay and Ebou Jobe. We arrived home at around 5:00 am in the morning,” she said. Ms. Sarr, narrated her ordeal to her Finish husband. She asked her husband to help document her encounter with Jammeh’s assassin team, which he did. She never reported the matter to the Gambian police, fearing that she would be harmed by Mr. Correa.  Later in the evening of June, 23rd 2013, Ms. Sarr phoned Mr. Ceesay, and was able to reach him on the phone. She was informed by Alhagie Mamut that they were under the custody of the Gambian security agents. That was the last time Ms. Sarr had spoken to Mr. Ceesay. She tried phoning Mr. Ceesay, but his phone was switched off. Two weeks after the arrest of Mr. Ceesay, and Jobe, her husband informed her that he read the story online about the arrest of Ceesay and Jobe. He was worried about the safety of her wife. He even recommended to Ms. Sarr to leave town, but Ms. Sarr was reluctant to leave at the time. She had a son and she thought that it doesn’t make sense to leave her child behind. She later traveled to Nigeria, to secure a visa for her son. Both Ms. Sarr, and her son now lived in Finland. It was this past week, she decided to go public with the arrest of Alhagie Mamut Ceesay and Ebou Jobe. She had earlier discussed the matter with Mr. Ceesay mum, and wife. She also informed Mr. Jobe’s wife about what she knew about the abduction of the two Americans. Ms. Sarr’s husband told Freedom Radio Gambia that he was in touch with the FBI, through the Finish police. He informed the Finish authorities what he knew about the disappearance of Ceesay and Jobe. But he is disappointed that neither the FBI, nor the Gambian police, have arrested Michael Correa and those linked to the arrest of Ceesay and Jobe.  Also speaking to Freedom Radio Gambia, was Jiela Nying, a Senegalese national. Ms. Nying said she also witnessed the arrest of Alhagie Mamut Ceesay and Ebou Jobe. She was a first-time visitor to the Gambia, when the incident happened. “I was saddened to see Alhagie Mamut Ceesay, and Ebou Jobe being manhandled by Michael Corra and others. They were placed in chains and forced to board a waiting unnumbered vehicle. Both Fatou Sarr, and myself, were harassed and subjected degrading treatment. I was six months pregnant at the time. I was somehow nervous, and confused. The soldiers forcefully kissed us. They were drunk. They told us that they will not allow anyone to destroy the country. This was the time, when  Alhagie and Ebou were being taken into custody,” she said. Ms. Nying, later returned to Senegal and told her mom to continue praying for her. She told her mom that she was glad to return home safely, but she would not elaborate further as to what happened during her trip to the Gambia. She discussed her story with one of her sisters. She told her that she narrowly escaped death, as Gambian soldiers wanted to kill her. She said the two Gambians she was travelling with Mr. Ceesay and Jobe never made it home. They were taken into custody and had since been declared missing. “Alhagie and Ebou are nice gentlemen. They were trying to give us ride and got arrested in the process. They have since not been seen by their families. I stopped visiting the Gambia since that incident,” she said.

News Sports Things to Do Life Obituaries e-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive MORGAN: Big Brother now has reinforcements Monday Mar 13, 2017 at 3:00 AM By TOM MORGAN Watch what you put in your microwave. The folks down at the CIA may be watching. Wikileaks just revealed the spooks have deployed over 1,000 electronic spy tools. To check your bra size. And my choice in shaving cream. Over 1,000 snoop tools! Just at the CIA. They can know what you read, what you watch on TV, what you argue about - by way of bugs in your computer and device screens, your television. Bugs in your microwave. In your washing machine. In your car. And some of these do more than eavesdrop. They can mess with you. So now you have someone to blame for the little annoyances in your daily life, such as, the coffee tastes lousy. Wiki tells us the Brits can check your viewing habits. Its spymasters cut a deal with South Korea’s Samsung to install surveillance chips in its TV sets. And you were worried about Big Brother? Welcome to family hour. We’ve got Big Sis, Big Cuz, Big Mama, Big Papa. And no doubt Big Waitress, Big Walmart Checkout Woman. They’re everywhere! I worry about the collaboration. Not just that our allies and enemies swap all this vital information with each other. I worry about all the household appliances gossiping at their electronic coffee klatch. And conspiring. “Hey, he whacked the air conditioner last night. How ‘bout we take down this dude. Coffee maker goes on strike. Garbage disposal backs up. Toilet plugs. Pacemaker kicks into turbo mode. Microwave breaks down. Tires blow out on his way to work. We’ll teach him to mess with us.” You think this is a joke? Artificial intelligence is on the way. Robots are invading us. When AI seizes the CIA’s espionage tools the game is up. Imagine the apps that will sprout from these developments. Go to Bomber to destroy the neighbor kid’s boombox. Click on Avenger and watch your neighbor’s too-loud lawn mower melt. See that driver who is texting at 70 mph? Now you don’t. Remember all your crazy conspiracy theories? That the Russians knew your next move before you did? That the Chinese wormed into your psyche to persuade you to buy their products? Hey! They are true! The propaganda microchip was in your Cheerios. So you no longer need worry about the conspiracies. They have all come about. You were right. So stop tossing and turning at night. We got you covered. The “We” being every spy agency known to humanity. And the many we don’t know about. Here is a sobering thought. A few years ago we learned that Israeli and American spooks had deposited electronic grit in Iran’s nuclear software. We learned they had turned Iranian computers into listening and viewing devices. They could watch to check if the Iranians were prostate and praying in the proper direction. Good blackmail opportunities there. The sobering bit was this. When we learned about it a few years ago it was obsolete. It had been screwing up the Iranians for over a decade. It seemed futuristic to us. But it was Model-T to the spooks. It is revelations like these that give me comfort. I figure if the Iranians ever try to harm Israel they will fry. Israel will flip every Iranian screen to porn. And then blitz the country back to Muhammad’s salad days. The same goes for the dimwits in North Korea. Every time we see a photo of Kim Jong-un we see military imbeciles in over-sized hats. They stand behind him with little notebooks and pencils at the ready to record Kim’s every word of wisdom. Such as “Snuff out my brother.” “Machine-gun Uncle Goon-Goon.” I’ve got news for these demented stenographers. Their pencils are miniature cameras. Sending video to the BBC. To be screened in our multi-gender toilets. Along with shots of Mrs. Merkel downing her daily strudel. And thanks to the invasion of our Maytags, it will all come out in the wash. Meanwhile, Bush the Younger can take a breather. Because this is all Trump’s fault. Gotta be. Tom Morgan is a veteran columnist whose column appears weekly in the Observer-Dispatch.

Palm trees rear like horses. Birds swing on the feeder like kids on a carnival ride. A great cloud of dust swallows up the mountains, whites out the valley and dims the neon lights along the Strip. Welcome to spring in the desert. The calendar claims it’s still winter. But I know the signs of spring when I see them. If you have never lived in a desert (as I do, just outside of Las Vegas) or camped in Death Valley (as I did once, long ago, when I was young and easily led) let me assure you that it is not for the faint of heart. The same can be said, of course, for other places, other climates, including the South where I grew up, and California, where I raised my children. There are countless places where wind and cold and heat and storms are as much a way of life as the local Walmart. But spring in the desert is special. Or so it is to me. For one thing, it starts early, often weeks ahead of schedule. One day, it’s winter. Cold and dreary, the kind of day that makes you bundle up in sweatsuits and crave potatoes and chocolate for supper. Well, it does that to me. Then next day, you wake up and walk outside as I did just yesterday and everything seems somehow different. The air is clear and 10 degrees warmer. The birds are bickering at the feeder. And lo and behold, the cyclamen you planted last fall in the pot by the front porch, only to watch it die a slow death in the winter, has miraculously risen from the dead. I wish you could see it. I grinned at that one red cyclamen bud and said to myself, “Spring is here!” It occurred to me that if I had planted spring bulbs last fall – narcissus and jonquils and tulips – they might be in bloom, as well. Then I recalled the year that I planted them and they all got eaten by rabbits. Fine. I like cyclamen. Then today, the wind began to howl 40-50 mph with gusts up to 60 or more. If I had a goat, I’d have gone out and tied it down. My husband’s swimsuit was drying on a rack by the hot tub. He grabbed it just in time before it ended up flying like a flag on the top of the Stratosphere. When he waved goodbye to go work out at the gym, he said, “If I don’t make it back for dinner, you’ll know I got airlifted to Oz.” Spring is showing up in other ways, in other places. My sweet cousin Sara, in North Carolina, posted a photo on Facebook of a tulip tree in full bloom, a tree that she helped our grandfather plant more than 20 years ago. It reminded me of what Granddad once told me about spring: “March comes in like a lion,” he explained, “because the Lord sends the wind to blow away the dead remains and make room for new growth.” Then he added with a grin, “But it always goes out like a lamb.” I think of his words every spring when the winds begin to blow. I claim them as a promise of new growth, new life to come. Granddad was a baker, a salesman and an occasional Baptist preacher. He loved planting and parables and making people laugh. I wonder. Could his thoughts on spring also apply to change? The winds of change are often unsettling. They uproot our lives, muddle our view, make us long to hunker down and hide. But what if they are sent to carry away the dead remains of the past – old hurts, mistakes and finished chapters of our lives – and make room for new growth and new beginnings? What if change in our lives, like a change in the weather, is just a promise of a new season? Somedays I like to think about such things. Especially when it’s windy. Wind makes me hopeful. Maybe next fall I’ll plant bulbs. Sharon Randall can be reached at P.O. Box 777394, Henderson NV 89077, or on her website: www.sharonrandall.com.

Also on Friday March 3,  Deputy Taylor Wallace made two arrests in an investigation regarding solicitation of a female minor.  In this case the following subjects were arrested: Douglas Ray Allen II, 27, of Isabella, Mo., was arrested on an unclassified felony count of enticement or attempted enticement of a child and felony Class E sexual misconduct involving a child under 15 1st  offense. This warrant carried a $20,000 10% cash or surety bond with conditions of no contact with children under 17 years of age, CPS supervision, and no social media.  Allen bonded with a bondsman and was given a later court date. Also arrested in this investigation was Ward Michael Anderson, 46, of Cabool, who was arrested on an unclassified felony count of enticement or attempted enticement of a child and felony Class E sexual misconduct involving a child under 15 1st  offense. This warrant carried a $20,000 10% cash or surety bond with conditions of no contact with children under 17 years of age, CPS supervision, and no social media.  Allen bonded with a bondsman and was given a later court date. Also arrested on Friday, March 3,  was Chad Norton, 38, of Ava,  on a capias no bond warrant issued for failure to obey judge’s order on a felony Class C possession of controlled substance (metham-phetamine). Norton was transported to the Greene County Jail where he was housed until his court date on March 7  at 9 a.m. On Sunday, March 5 , the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office received and responded to one of the most difficult calls we will ever take, when emotionally impaired persons try to do suicide by cop. This subject had been armed with a knife but decided to put it down.  The subject began coming at Sheriff Degase and trying to get him to kill him. He was then tackled and taken into custody by Deputy Kobby Roberts. Deputy Roberts quick actions and thinking potentially saved a man’s life. A good job to my entire staff and to Cox Ambulance personnel who responded to take care of the subject’s injuries he had inflicted upon himself prior to our arrival.  The subject was transported to the hospital for treatment. 2017-03-13 News Server tweet Previous: Plant Rhubarb In March Next: Another Band of Storms Causes Power Outages Across Missouri About News Server Related Articles City Considers Changing Electric Rate Structure, Advances Street Numbers to Names Project March 16, 2017 Another Band of Storms Causes Power Outages Across Missouri March 13, 2017 MDC Offers New Permit Card For Hunters, Anglers, and Trappers March 13, 2017 General Interest City Considers Changing Electric Rate Structure, Advances Street Numbers to Names Project March 16, 2017 Another Band of Storms Causes Power Outages Across Missouri March 13, 2017 Sheriff Report 3.9.2017 March 13, 2017 MDC Offers New Permit Card For Hunters, Anglers, and Trappers March 13, 2017 Alumni Games March 13, 2017 All-Conference Honors Announced By the SCA March 13, 2017 Notes From Hunter Creek – Hiking March 13, 2017 New Sidewalks Nearing Completion March 2, 2017 February Temperatures Ranged from 18 to 82; Rainfall Very Slight March 2, 2017 Congressman Jason Smith Announces Start of Dawt Mill Dam Removal March 2, 2017 Letter to the Editor – Electric Meters March 2, 2017 Gov.

We hope you enjoy this classic piece from Bill. *** Gerard Mulliez is often called the Sam Walton of France. The Mulliez (pronounced Mool-yay) family got started in textile manufacturing 200 years ago. By the 1950s, the textile industry in France had collapsed. So, Gerard boldly took the family out of textiles and invested what was left of the family fortune in big-box retail stores. There are a surprising number of similarities between the Waltons of Arkansas (of Walmart fame) and this retailing family of northern France. (More on that in just a second.) The Mulliez family has businesses with annual revenues of about $60 billion and more than a quarter million employees. You’ve probably never heard of them. And you’ve almost certainly never seen a picture of them. They’re discreet, private and unassuming. The family have huge discount shopping centres all over France and much of Europe. And they’re rapidly expanding in many emerging markets. The key to the family’s success was figuring out how to run large-surface, low-price, rapid-turnover merchandising enterprises. Once the family had the system figured out, they were able to apply it to several different retail industries. The family has been in business for two centuries. But only in the last 50 years has it built one of the world’s biggest and most profitable family-business empires. And it has done it while also creating one of the biggest and most successful families. I have identified six secrets to the Mulliez family’s success… Success Secret No. 1: A big family can be a big help It helps to have a big family. The founding couple had 13 children. Their children almost all had several children too. Three of them had seven children each. The disadvantage of a large family is that you have to split up the wealth among more people. But the advantage is that you have more hands to do the work. And the odds are you will have some clever people in the group. Success Secret No. 2: Make ‘everything for everybody’ Second, the Mulliez family decided not to split things up…but to have a system of ‘everything for everybody’ in which all children of the founding family shared equally in the family wealth (shares in active companies, mostly). The Walton family set things up in a similar way. Family members all received an equal share of a family-limited partnership. This was a break with tradition in two key respects. Typically, family members who are actively involved in the wealth-building process get a larger share of the family wealth than family members who are not actively involved. Although it makes logical sense to incentivize family members to participate in the business by rewarding them with a bigger share of the pie, over time this approach can be divisive. And typically in the north of France — where the Mulliez family is from — though wealth may be divided equally, women are usually given real estate and men are given the business (on the theory that men will take the risks and rewards of an active business, while women will be happy to have the security of real estate). The Mulliez family decided to buck both trends. And these two decisions, taken decades ago, made a big difference to the family business. It kept the entire family focused on it, because they were all in it together. Success Secret No. 3: Promote the affectio societatis The third secret of the Mulliez family’s success is that the family makes a huge effort at affectio societatis. In other words, they share the same ideas, and commit to achieving those together. This unites individual family members and gives them a sense of belonging to a collective group; in this case the family group. The family narrative is transmitted to each generation. Put another way, the Mulliez family consciously reinforces the family’s original principles, values and philosophies. And they take active steps to perpetuate their family culture. Success Secret No. 4: Keep out of the public eye The fourth secret of success is that the family has been careful not to get caught up in the trappings of wealth or fame. They keep out of the public eye. They won’t be seen on yachts in St Tropez or flashing their wealth in Paris. There are few — if any — photos of family members circulating in the press. Despite their wealth, few outside of their core circle of friends know who they are or what they look like. ‘When you talk to the media,’ says one of the family members, ‘you distract yourself from your own work. Worse, when you tell the media things as you wished they were, you alienate yourself from reality.’ The family lives by the famous dictum of St Francis de Sales, ‘Fame never did good. Good never got fame.’ Success Secret No. 5: Don’t sell The Mulliez family has kept control of its businesses. It has had many chances to sell and reach for a ‘liquidity event’. But it has rejected them systematically. Mulliez family members are allowed to sell their shares only to other family members. ‘If we sold,’ says one family member, ‘what would we do better with the money?’ ‘Besides, the stock market is nothing other than prostitution of businesses. You’ll never make me believe that something that is worth €100 today was worth €120 yesterday and will be worth €90 tomorrow. ‘The stock market is as though you had a daughter. And you made her put on lipstick and open her blouse and shorten her skirt and every day you put her on the sidewalk at a different price. ‘Don’t expect me to value our family wealth that way. Our businesses are not expected to last for days, or weeks or months, like stocks on the stock market, but in terms of generations. We don’t build enterprises to sell. We build them in order to pass along responsibility to our children. When you create an enterprise, it’s like having a child.’ Success Secret No. 6: Create active shareholders The Mulliez family requires all shareholders — who are also uncles, cousins and other relatives — to play some role in the family enterprise. Even if they are not active in the business, they are supposed to inform themselves about how the business is doing and help sustain its founding principles. These interested, knowledgeable and committed shareholders allow the Mulliez businesses to take a more long-term outlook. They are not overly concerned with quarterly results or with dividend payouts. What concerns them is the growth and health of the extended business empire.
