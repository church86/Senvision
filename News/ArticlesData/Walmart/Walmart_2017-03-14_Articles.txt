On March 9, the Cabell County Commission in West Virginia took legal action, not against users or drug dealers, but against companies that distribution prescription painkillers. The lawsuit alleges these companies knowingly ignored the opioid epidemic, by delivering huge amounts of opioids to drug stores in Cabell County. It says the companies “sold some 40 million doses of hydrocodone and oxycodone to Cabell County pharmacies between 2007 and 2012” The county’s population is less than 100,000. The suit names AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, CVS Indiana, L.L.C., Cardinal Health, Inc., Rite-Aid of Maryland, Inc., Walmart Stores East, LP, Kroger Limited Partnerships I & II, McKesson Corporation, Walgreen Eastern Co. Inc.,and H.D. Smith Wholesale Drug Co. AmerisourceBergen response: AmerisourceBergen has been and remains committed to the safe and appropriate delivery of controlled substances. We work on a daily basis with regulatory agencies and our customers to combat drug diversion, while being mindful of the need for appropriate access to medications for patients whose doctors and care providers have prescribed them. Lawsuits modeled on legal claims that have already been settled with the State of West Virginia divert attention and resources from the collective action that’s needed from prescribers, wholesalers, pharmacists, patients, insurers, regulators and enforcement authorities to address the impact of prescription drug abuse in our communities. We plan to vigorously defend ourselves in this litigation while continuing to work collaboratively with our supply chain partners in combating drug diversion.” CVS response:   “CVS Health is committed to the highest standards of ethics and business practices, including complying with all federal and state laws governing the distribution of controlled substance prescriptions from our distribution centers, and is dedicated to reducing prescription drug abuse and diversion. We also have stringent policies, procedures and tools to ensure that our pharmacists properly exercise their corresponding responsibility to determine whether a controlled substance prescription was issued for a legitimate medical purpose before filling it. Our commitment to preventing prescription drug abuse also extends to our patient and youth education efforts, an industry-leading program to increase access to the overdose-reversal medication, naloxone, and a drug collection unit donation program to local police departments nationwide. And in West Virginia specifically, all of our pharmacies replaced single ingredient PSE products with a tamper-resistant PSE product to prevent its usage in the making of methamphetamine.” Cardinal Health response: “We believe that these copycat lawsuits do not advance any of the hard work needed to solve the opioid abuse crisis – an epidemic driven by addiction, demand and the diversion of medications for illegitimate use. Cardinal Health maintains a sophisticated anti-diversion program that includes advanced analytics, technology and the deployment of teams of investigators embedded within our supply chain. We continue to work collaboratively with all participants - regulators, physicians, manufacturers, and pharmacists - to collectively address the constantly changing tactics utilized by those determined to obtain these medications for non-medical use. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against these allegations.” RiteAid response:   “We do not comment on pending litigation.” MSNBC asked, but did not receive a response from:             Walmart             Kroger             McKesson Corp             Walgreens             HD Smith The national organization representing primary pharmaceutical manufacturers, the Healthcare Distribution Alliance: “Prescription drug abuse is a complex problem and each component of the supply chain shares the responsibility for controlling the availability of opioid pain medications. This epidemic must be addressed through a multi-faceted, collaborative approach that includes the doctors who write the prescriptions, the pharmacists who dispense the drugs, the distributors who deliver the medicines, the manufacturers who make and promote the products, and the federal and state regulators who license and regulate these entities and determine supply. “Enhanced communication and coordination between the DEA and supply chain stakeholders is critical to successfully addressing prescription drug abuse and diversion. To that end, HDA is pleased with the willingness of the current leadership at the DEA to meet with and engage registrants, and is encouraged by the agency’s desire to ‘reset the relationship’ with our industry. “The DEA’s strategy now is to work with registrants to actively clarify ambiguities in the regulations before they become a problem. The agency is laying the groundwork for an even more collaborative approach to solving the opioid abuse epidemic in exactly the way that the Government Accountability Office recommended in 2015 by developing rulemaking to further clarify the responsibilities of distributors. We look forward to engaging with the DEA as this effort unfolds.” Explore: Drugs Tuesday's Mini-Report, 3.14.17 Obtained tax documents shed new light on...

(WLS) WLS By Sarah Schulte Tuesday, March 14, 2017 04:01PM CHICAGO, IL -- A person is in custody after a shooting in a Walmart parking lot in southwest Chicago, police said. One person was hospitalized with a gunshot wound, and another was hospitalized after being struck by a vehicle, said Bedford Park Police Chief Daniel Godfrey. Police said the people in two vehicles were allegedly flashing gang signs to each other while driving. The vehicles pulled into the Walmart parking lot where one vehicle reportedly stopped, and two people got out. Police said the driver of the second vehicle ran over one of the people who exited the first vehicle. Then there was gunfire, according to police, and the driver of the striking vehicle was shot at least once in the face. Inside the store, there was chaos as employees and customers were trying to figure out what was happening. "I was waiting for a cab. I saw people running, women running, men running, I was running, too," said shopper Angela Jernagin. Customers and employees were told to go to the back of the store. Some began posting pictures on social media as they were trying to reach family members. Eventually, police allowed everyone to leave. Some employees who were working later shifts came to check on their coworkers. "A lot of them are shaken up," said employee David Pineda. "I was so scared for my life. I didn't know what was going on. I know I was getting out of the way, I didn't want to get hit with bullets," Jenigan said. No word on whether charges have been filed.

Top Retailers>Walmart Walmart CEO cites growing importance of private label Store brands seen as driver of margins, loyalty Mark Hamstra 1 | Mar 14, 2017 With national brand grocery product increasingly available through pure-play e-commerce retailers such as Amazon, Walmart sees its private label brands, such as Great Value, playing a bigger role in the company’s success going forward. The widespread availability of name-brand products online will compress the margins of those products over time, said Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Walmart, speaking at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2017 Consumer & Retail Technology Conference in New York on Tuesday. “Having a private brand from a margin mix point of view has always been important, but it is even more important now,” McMillon (left) said. Walmart has undertaken a significant effort to improve its sourcing capabilities in private label, an effort led by David Cheesewright, president and CEO of WalMart International, as the company seeks to improve both the quality and the profit margins of those items. The company, which has long relied on offering “name brands for less,” is increasingly looking for its private labels to drive loyalty, he explained. “If we have engineered our specs so that you really love our granola, then there’s a loyalty there that passes not just through the store but into the e-commerce business as well,” said McMillon. “Product-driven loyalty becomes even more important than it was in the past.” Battling Lidl Product attributes including quality and package size are also key to battling the expected rollout of German discounter Lidl in the U.S., McMillon said, citing Walmart’s experience competing against hard-discounter Aldi in the U.S. and against both Aldi and Lidl in the U.K. “It starts with assortment,” he said. “We’ve got to make sure that the quality of our merchandise is right, not just the price.” Product package sizes are important, “so it is easy for a customer to compare one item against another,” McMillon added. “Product engineering has to come first, and pricing has to come second.” In addition, shopping has to be quick and easy for customers, even in large Supercenters, he said, so they can better compete against the small, easy-to-shop formats of Aldi and Lidl. “We need to innovate for speed, so people can find the item they need to get in and out of the store quickly,” he said. “We are going to try to take away the advantages the discounters have, and then play to our strengths.” Responding to a question about how Wal-Mart is working with its suppliers to achieve its efforts around price reductions, McMillon said that cutting back on advertising and promotions will help. He said the company had “drifted away” from its core EDLP model and was running too many promotions in print ads. By cutting back on promotions, Walmart is asking its vendors for less ad funding and instead focusing on negotiating off-invoice pricing, McMillon said. Improving store pickup Walmart is also refining its click-and-collect grocery operations to make them more efficient at the store level, he said. “Our customers love [store] pickup,” McMillon said, citing high customer-satisfaction scores around the service. Now that Walmart has been providing the service for a while — it has expanded to more than 600 locations — it has learned how to better organize its stores to manage the offering, he said. “The physical store is improving as it relates to pickup,” said McMillon. “We are learning how to manage the outside experience so it’s faster, and we are learning how to build the back room so inventory can be moved from in-store pickup to exterior pickup quickly and easily.” Stores have also begun locating refrigeration close to the pickup area to improve speed of service, he said. Those same refinements are also helping the company as it gears up to expand home delivery, he said. McMillon noted, however, that delivery will likely only account for a small percentage of orders. In the U.K., where Walmart’s ASDA banner has been offering delivery for more than 15 years, “well over 90%” of sales volume is still done in-store, he said. Walmart has also learned that click-and-collect and delivery services need scale to be economically viable. In some areas, the company has found that using a single store to supply pickup and home delivery for other nearby locations is more efficient. “It actually does make sense in some cases to have a hub, picking and delivering to other stores, and to the home,” McMillon said. “We are figuring out where to do it, and where not to do it.” Walmart still sees its Supercenters as the backbone of the company’s success, he said, noting that the company continues to experiment with different Supercenter formats and designs. Two of the newest Supercenter prototypes in Lake Nona, Fla., near Orlando, and in Tomball, Texas, in the Houston market, display features that will be incorporated in other stores going forward, McMillon said, although he did not reveal which specific features would be rolled out further. As previously reported, the Lake Nona store includes an organic restaurant, called Grown, offers a mobile “scan-and-go” app, in-store order kiosks and includes enhancements around store pickup. The stores also feature a bright, modern layout and an expanded offering of perishables. These newest stores “represent some of our latest thinking in supercenter design, and that might give you some idea of where we might allocate some of our remodel dollars going forward,” McMillon said.

Most Popular The name denotes smallness, but body wash Le Petit Marseillais is big in France. Now Johnson & Johnson hopes it can attain similar stature in the U.S. with a relatively small budget and full distribution at retail giant Walmart, as the company for the first time launches a beauty brand here with no TV. Le Petit Marseillais is France's leading body wash, used in more than half the country's households and already sold in more than 20 countries worldwide. Launched originally in the 1980s and acquired by J&J in 2006, it started its U.S. launch last month with five body wash products backed by digital and social media plus scented magazine ads. The brand rolls into Walmart's specialty bath and body sections with a fuller 17-item line that includes body lotions on March 16. The U.S. launch, which follows successful expansion for into Russia and Turkey last year, is handled by DDB, Paris, which handles the brand globally. "We're not following the traditional launch model using TV," said Jorge Mesquita, worldwide chairman of J&J Consumer Cos., in a presentation at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference last month. "We're creating a grassroots movement for LPM by using digital media as our primary source." "I think a digital-first approach has worked," said Dawn Kidd, senior marketing director at J&J in an interview, who said the brand is off to a fast start. The introduction has included backing from social-media influencers who have French roots, such as Christina Caradona, a beauty blogger who grew up in France and New York. Ads include Google search and Facebook, with the brand already logging a million likes in the U.S. Its video featuring line drawings of its trademark sailor boy bringing the brand to the U.S. got more than 630,000 views in two weeks. Comments on the video are heavy with fond remembrances among people who've encountered the brand in France and look forward to finding it in U.S. stores. Ms. Kidd said the brand "conveys the sunniness and joie de vivre of being in the south of France in Provence" and has gotten a 1-5% share in markets it's recently entered. "We feel like the U.S. market is perfect," she said. "There's a lot of fondness for everything French." That includes, she hopes, at Walmart, with a mid-tier value price ahead of Colgate-Palmolive Co.'s Softsoap but a bit below Unilever's Dove and well below J&J's own Neutrogena or OGX. Like the latter, Le Petit Marseilles has a natural positioning, including olive-oil-based soap and ingredients such as Mediterranean algae, marine minerals, beeswax and orange blossoms. Correction: An earlier version of the story mistakenly said Le Petit Marseillais ranks among the top five body-wash brands in every market it's entered up to now. The brand has gotten a 1-5% share in new markets it's recently entered.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 14 March 2017 by Military News Is TripAdvisor Inc the Next Buyout Candidate in the Online Travel Industry? On this episode of Market Foolery , Mac Greer is joined by Motley Fool analysts Ron Gross and Matt Argersinger as they open the mailbag to respond to three listener questions: How do companies manage their massive stock buybacks? Is it possible that Priceline (NASDAQ: PCLN) and Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE)  are both pursuing TripAdvisor (NASDAQ: TRIP) right now? And is taking profits on your big stock winners a good way to rebalance, or just trimming your flowers and watering your weeds? A full transcript follows the video. 10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks  for investors to buy right now… and Wal-Mart wasn’t one of them! That’s right — they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. Click here  to learn about these picks! *Stock Advisor returns as of March 6, 2017 The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned. This podcast was recorded on March 8, 2017. Mac Greer:  It’s Wednesday, March 8th. Welcome to Market Foolery . I’m Mac Greer. Joining me in studio we have Ron Gross, from Motley Fool Total Income, and Matt Argersinger, from Million Dollar Portfolio . Gentlemen, welcome! Matt Argersinger:  Thanks, Mac! Ron Gross: How you doing, Mac? Greer:  Guys, I’m doing well, and we’re going to try something a little different today. We are going with an all mailbag episode. Fool mailbag, OK? Gross:  OK. I’m in. Like I have a choice. Greer:  You have no choice. We’re going to begin with a question about stock buybacks from Tom Smith from Antioch, California. Tom also identifies himself as listener No. 13, and he’s a Stock Advisor and Rule Your Retirement member. Gross:  A baker’s dozen! Greer:  A baker’s dozen. And he’s a member, so bump up your game. Tom’s question: How are stock buybacks actually done? For example, did Home Depot  just put $15 billion in their Schwab  account and then put in a limit order? It seems like they have to be careful not to make huge purchases that would shoot their stock price up, too. I’m just curious as to the mechanics of the repurchase process. Ron Gross? Gross:  Nothing says good podcasts like the mechanics of stock buybacks, but I will refer everyone to SEC rule 10b-18. Of course, I’m sure most of us are familiar with it. Greer:  Wow. This is where we lower expectations. Argersinger:  This is getting interesting. Gross:  No, but the bottom line is, yes, you do certainly need a broker. It’s not your Schwab account, it’s an actual human being who can work and order for you and make trades for you. There’s many, many rules associated with stock buybacks, a big one being that you can’t be in possession of material nonpublic information, so insider information, which is actually kind of hard, because everything is inside when you work for a company. But it can’t be really material, something that you know will affect the stock either way. You only can use one broker in any given day. You can’t have many brokers out there putting out different bids for a stock for you, for example. You can’t buy more than 25% of the daily volume. You can’t be the first trade of the day, you can’t trade in the last 30 minutes of the day. Lots and lots of different rules you must follow to keep everything on the up-and-up. Once you get the hang of it, it’s not too hard to stay compliant. Argersinger:  I’d say it’s fair to say that Home Depot is not opening a discount brokerage account at Charles Schwab . They obviously have a specialist, probably someone at a major brokerage or investment bank that’s able to buy in bulk, I would imagine. That’s generally how it works. Greer:  Related question here: When are stock buybacks a bullish indicator, and when should investors beware? Gross:  The easiest thing to say is, it’s a great use of capital when the stock is undervalued. But how do you judge that? That’s the trick. Companies, history has shown, will often buy their stock back at the wrong time, when the stocks are someone overvalued, and that is a terrible use of capital, and it destroys shareholder value. So, you have to be careful. Another reason I hate to see stock buybacks is when the company is trying to offset the dilution caused by issuing options to its employees. I understand why it’s done, but you don’t want to see that, typically, as a good use of capital. So, if they have a lot of cash, they don’t have growth opportunities for all of it, they see their stock as being a great growth opportunity at a good price, then go for it, buy all the stock you can back. Greer:  Our second email comes from Gilly Beaman. Gilly asks, what are the odds that Priceline and Expedia are both calling TripAdvisor at the same time to discuss an acquisition? Matt? Argersinger:  Ah, yeah, Gilly, I think with TripAdvisor at a five-year low, the odds are probably as good as they’ve ever been right now. And there’s been rumors in recent years about an acquisition. I think the best fit is probably Priceline. One, it would really boost Priceline’s share of U.S. travel customers. We know booking.com is their big platform. Super popular in Europe. Not so huge here in the U.S. So, it really boosts their marketing potential here in the U.S. TripAdvisor has 350 million unique visitors each month. That’s a huge number. Something like almost 400 million reviews. Mac, I know that you’re responsible for at least a dozen or so reviews. Greer:  I am. I get their emails, I’m one of their top-rated reviewers, at least in this ZIP code. Gross:  Wow, we’re here with royalty. Greer:  That’s right. Argersinger:  So, there are a lot of eyeballs that Priceline can gain by buying TripAdvisor. And TripAdvisor has this growing activities business, which is getting some kind of scale. If you think about Priceline as mostly getting people to the destination, while TripAdvisor has things they can actually do when they get to the destination. So, it helps Priceline become more of a one-stop shop OTA. What I’ll say though, in reality, I don’t think Priceline will ever get the chance, because I think Expedia would be — if TripAdvisor was compelling enough — they would actually be the one to make the acquisition. And that’s because there’s a strong relationship between TripAdvisor and Expedia through Liberty Interactive . And I’ll explain that for those who don’t know, and you kind of have to bear with me here. Barry Diller and John Malone, longtime friends, occasional business partners. Diller is Expedia’s chairman. Liberty Interactive, which is controlled by John Malone, owns 16% of Expedia. Liberty Interactive, in turn, owns a controlling stake in TripAdvisor through its Liberty TripAdvisor tracking stock. Gross:  For those that are still with us — Argersinger:  It goes on. The CEO of Liberty Interactive, Greg Maffei, also happens to be the chairman of TripAdvisor. Gross:  Am I crazy, or wasn’t TripAdvisor spun out of Expedia? Argersinger:  It was. It’s not controlled by Expedia except to the extent that Liberty Interactive has a stake in Expedia and TripAdvisor. Greer:  At this point, I almost want to go back to the stock buyback discussion. [laughs] Argersinger:  I think, at today’s price, an acquisition of TripAdvisor looks compelling to both. But I would say Expedia has, probably, the first dibs. Priceline would have to make a very compelling case and pay a pretty big premium. Gross: And Priceline is a much bigger company, $85 billion or so, versus Expedia at $18 billion, TripAdvisor now, as Matt said, only a $6 billion company in. So you could get this done with stock, or even low-cost debt if you wanted to. But Priceline is more likely. Greer: See, I like the Expedia angle because I like Priceline, I love the reviews, I contribute reviews and I post reviews, but I don’t buy and I don’t transact — I’m sorry, I just blew that. I love TripAdvisor. I contribute reviews, I read reviews. But the problem for me and TripAdvisor is I don’t transact through TripAdvisor. I find the hotel or the place I like, and then I go to Expedia, or I go to the hotel’s website. If Expedia buys them, then it’s that one-stop shop, I could book my flight on Expedia, I could book my hotel on Expedia, and I can read the reviews. Argersinger:  That’s absolutely right, and that’s the challenge. TripAdvisor is trying to move to that booking platform where you can do everything there. Greer: Inertia, I’m not doing it. Argersinger:  [laughs] You’re right. So, something like an Expedia acquisition accelerates that, and makes that redundant. Greer: Our third email comes from Jerry Valanni from Cleveland, Ohio. Jerry writes: Due to the great market over the past year I have a few stocks in my portfolio that have doubled since I bought them. I have been reading up on the strategy of selling half a position when the position doubles. The pro seems to be locking in profits and rebalancing your portfolio. The con seems to be cutting in a half a potential huge winner. I was wondering what your thoughts were on this. Argersinger:  Jerry, I’d say the con is pretty strong for us. We have a term hear at the Fool, and I’m not sure if David Gardner coined it or if he was the first to use it, but it’s called trimming your flowers and watering your weeds. Jerry, that sounds a little bit like what you’re thinking about doing. In most cases, you actually want to do the exact opposite. You really want to add to your winners and sell your losers, in most cases. But have a healthy biased toward holding on to your winners as long as you can. And, I’d say, especially if you have high conviction in the company, you don’t need the cash immediately, and, of course, if you don’t see better opportunities elsewhere. If that’s all going for you, I would always lean toward holding onto your winners. Gross: Yeah. I take a little bit more of a value investor slant to that, although I won’t completely disagree with Matty. In fact, I won’t disagree with a lot of that. But for me, it boils down to two things: Do you think the stock still has market-beating potential? If it doesn’t, you probably shouldn’t own any of it, if you really want to take a value investor perspective. But if you think it does, then own as much as you like. The second thing is: Can you sleep at night? If a stock is 20% to 40% of your portfolio, is it literally affecting your sleep? If not, maybe it’s OK. For me, it’s not. I don’t typically go over 10%. That’s a big number for me. Everyone is different. But for me, the bottom line is, it’s not how big of an allocation you have, it’s what is the future potential of the stock? Greer: And guys, Jerry also had some thoughts on how Starbucks could solve its traffic problem. You may have read recently that Starbucks, with the popularity of its mobile ordering system, a lot of in-store traffic. Here’s Jerry’s idea: After listening to your report that Starbucks’ problem is too many orders at morning rush hour, it got me to thinking that maybe they should institute Uber-like surge pricing. During the morning rush, it’s $0.10 or $0.20 more, and then cheaper in the afternoon when demand is slow. Gross: So Jerry got two questions here today? Greer: It’s a question and a comment. Gross: OK. The business term for what he’s talking about, Uber’s surge pricing, but it’s dynamic pricing. And most pricing is based on demand, and supply, for that matter. But typically, it doesn’t get adjusted intra-day like you could see in surge pricing with Uber. But, a great example would be airlines. Airlines fluctuate their prices based on demand and the seat supply all the time. Auto dealerships do it, bars have happy hours where they charge less of a price at the time of day where it’s not typically crowded. Greer: I’ve heard of that. Gross: [laughs] There’s dynamic pricing all over the place. Disneyland is starting. I read a great article that really summarizes all the ways dynamic pricing is currently being used. The problem is, there’s going to be backlash. There’s backlash at Uber. People hate the surge pricing. There have been giant periods of time where they’ve had to phase it out, it still remains, however. If you go to Starbucks and you end up leaving angry that you paid more than you would have if you had waited a half hour, I have a feeling that won’t work. Argersinger:  Yeah. I think with quick serve restaurants — it’s not fair to put Starbucks in that category — but there is a transparency of pricing that’s pretty important. So I think if you walked into a Starbucks and you’re thinking, „I know what I want, but I don’t know how much it’s going to cost until I go up to the cashier,” that creates an interesting dilemma. But I have to say, I think Jerry is onto something here. I think dynamic pricing, as Ron described really well, that’s something that can work for more and more industries. And I think because we are an on-demand consumer now, we’re willing to pay more if our time is more important to us in certain cases. So I like the idea. Gross: I think the stock market is the biggest example of dynamic pricing. The pricing changes literally by the second based on supply and demand. And we seem to accept that. So, I think it could translate elsewhere. Greer: But, do you think, in our situation, we have a Starbucks and a Dunkin’ Donuts right by the office. If Starbucks did something like this and hiked the price of coffee $0.10 to $0.20 in the morning, could they get away with that? I already go to Dunkin’, so I’m probably not the best example, but do you think they could get away with that? Argersinger:  You’ll start seeing, like with gasoline, they put the prices out front, and it’s like, „Oh, it’s $0.20 cheaper over here, I’ll go here.” I’ll walk an extra two blocks to save myself $0.20 on a cup of coffee. I don’t know. Gross: The toll roads have it now based on the demand for the express lane. They have the prices change up and down. And for me, it remains to be seen. It sometimes can backfire, and you have the opposite reaction that you want folks to have, ends up happening. So you run into Dunkin’ Donuts instead because you’re angry at Starbucks? That could be a problem. Argersinger:  It really is fascinating, because it is the value placed on time. I’ve been in lines many times where I thought, „I will pay an extra $1 if I can get out of here in two minutes as opposed to waiting 15 or 20 minutes.” That happens all the time. Greer: OK guys, we will leave it there. You can always email your questions to marketfoolery@fool.com . Thanks to Jerry, Gilly, and Tom. Matt and Ron, thanks for joining me.

(KTRK) KTRK Tuesday, March 14, 2017 07:56AM HOUSTON -- A wild scene was caught on camera in the parking lot of a Walmart in west Houston. In the video, a man suspected of checking car doors to see if they were unlocked was held at gunpoint by a potential victim. The potential victim and his wife had been watching the suspect from inside their vehicle, according to a Facebook post. When the suspect approached, the man pulled out his gun to subdue him. The man was taken to a hospital on an emergency detention order, but the DA's office did not press any charges against him.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 14 March 2017 by Military News One Put, One Call Option To Know About for Wal-Mart Stores Shutterstock photo Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist at Stock Options Channel is Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Symbol: WMT). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the April expiration for WMT. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $67.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 66 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1% return against the $67.50 commitment, or a 7.8% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ). Selling a put does not give an investor access to WMT’s upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. sees its shares decline 3.4% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $66.84 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the 66 cents from $67.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 7.8% annualized rate of return. Worth considering, is that the annualized 7.8% figure actually exceeds the 2.9% annualized dividend paid by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. by 4.9%, based on the current share price of $69.97. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 3.36% to reach the $67.50 strike price. Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., looking at the dividend history chart for WMT below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.9% annualized dividend yield. Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the April expiration, for shareholders of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Symbol: WMT) looking to boost their income beyond the stock’s 2.9% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $70.50 strike and collecting the premium based on the $1.21 bid, annualizes to an additional 13.8% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost ), for a total of 16.7% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $70.50 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but WMT shares would have to climb 0.9% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 2.7% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called. The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., highlighting in green where the $67.50 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $70.50 strike in red: The chart above, and the stock’s historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the April put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (considering the last 251 trading day WMT historical stock prices using closing values, as well as today’s price of $69.97) to be 18%. In mid-afternoon trading on Monday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 685,332 contracts, with call volume at 685,332, for a put:call ratio of 0.73 so far for the day, which is above normal compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65. In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we’d expect to see, we’re actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in options trading so far today. Find out which 15 call and put options traders are talking about today .

Revenue, excluding currency, increased 3% to $133.6 billion in retailer's fourth quarter 2016. Comparable store sales in the Walmart U.S. business grew 1.8%, driven by a 1.4% increase in customer traffic. As the industry tries to adapt to a new omnichannel reality, Walmart has been accelerating its e-commerce growth after acquiring Jet.com last year and bringing on Marc Lore as CEO of Walmart's U.S. e-commerce business. "We saw strong growth this quarter in the Walmart U.S. e-commerce business with GMV and sales growth of 36% and 29%, respectively," said Brett Biggs, EVP and CFO. The company also saw an uptick in its e-commerce business since its January 31 switch to free two-day shipping with a minimum order of $35.  "Our integrated offering means customers are shopping with us through multiple channels. In fact, over the holidays, Pickup Today, which is available in Walmart U.S. stores, grew by 27% over last year," said Biggs. Over the holidays, wait times were down for Pickup and the retailer is adding more items to Pickup Today. "Customers love being able to order an item with an app and get it that day," explained CEO Doug McMillon. Walmart said it is now the second-largest U.S. online retailer by revenue, one of the top three online retailers by traffic and its Walmart app is among the top three apps in retail. Walmart is rolling out new capabilities in the Walmart app in March and a new store experience that allows customers to skip traditional service lines using “express lanes” in these areas. The app will now allow for easy refills of prescriptions and simplified money transferring where the shopper can fill out information on the app ahead of time instead of filling out paperwork in store. After using the app for either of these service shoppers will be able to use the “express lane” to move to the front of the line. The new capabilities are expected to be available in Walmart’s 4,700 stores by fall. “These capabilities are the latest example of how we’re bringing together all of the conveniences of Walmart – great stores, convenient pickup, easy checkout and a top-notch app – to deliver one seamless shopping experience for customers,” said Daniel Eckert, SVP, Walmart Services. Updates to the app aren’t surprising as mobile becomes increasingly important for Walmart. Black Friday weekend sales marked the first time the number of people shopping online surpassed people shopping in stores for Walmart, and over half did through mobile devices. Further, more than 70% of traffic to Walmart.com during Black Friday and Cyber Monday was driven by mobile.  Inside the workforce, Walmart said new technology and apps are providing real-time information to improve its in-stock levels and better manage inventory, which is down 7% this quarter versus last year on a comp-store basis. The company has also been experimenting with customer experience initiatives, opening two new Supercenters in Florida and Texas, with features like scan-and-go, touch-screens where customers can access more items on Walmart.com, virtual item displays, and an integrated Health & Wellness section. Customer expectations continue to change rapidly, noted McMillon. "They will increasingly expect even more personalization and convenience in their shopping experience. We’re moving quickly to respond to the current opportunities as well as to innovate and transform the shopping experience for our customers in the future."     RELATED LINKS Customer Engagement Tech Trends Study: The Personalization Imperative The Fulfillment Revolution: Adapting Slow Systems for Fast-Moving Shoppers An Engaged Workforce is the Key to Prolonged Omnichannel Success Strategies to Maximize the Peak Selling Season POST A COMMENT Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus RATE THIS CONTENT (5 Being the Best) Rating Rating Rating Rating Rating 1 2 3 4 5 Current rating: 0 (0 ratings) Tweet Add To Favorite Email Print Text Size + − MOST READ STORIES 10 Most Valuable Retail Brands Top 10 Biggest U.S. Retailers Top 10 Highest Rated Retail CEOs Top 5 and Bottom 5 Retailers of Q1 JCPenney COO Calls Legacy IT Systems Major Hurdle in Turnaround Efforts TRENDAGRAMMore > Digital Promotion: How Grocers Are Driving Sales topicsMore > Omnichannel Merchandising Innovation Mobility Customer Experience Marketing/ Promotions Store Systems Analytics RIS EVENTS Follow us on <script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript" src="http://edgell.nui.media/pipeline/205684/0/vj?z=edgell&amp;dim=1886&amp;kw=&amp;click=&amp;abr=$scriptiniframe"></script><noscript><a href="http://edgell.nui.media/pipeline/205684/0/cc?z=edgell"><img src="http://edgell.nui.media/pipeline/205684/0/vc?z=edgell&amp;dim=1886&amp;kw=&amp;click=&amp;abr=$imginiframe" width="728" height="90" alt="" border="0" /></a></noscript> Contact Us Editorial Board Media Kit Privacy Statement Terms & Conditions 8550 W.

(Republican File ) Print Email Jim Kinney | jkinney@repub.com By Jim Kinney | jkinney@repub.com The Republican Follow on Twitter on March 14, 2017 at 7:50 AM comments BOSTON -- Walmart announced Monday that 8,000 Massachusetts employees will share in $1.6 million in quarterly bonuses based on their store's performance in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Massachusetts payouts are part of $157 million nationwide paid to 850,000 Walmart associates in the U.S., according to a news release. Walmart U.S. had recorded its strongest sales performance of the year in the fourth quarter, the company said. It was a 1.8 percent increase in the fourth quarter. The bonuses, along with an annual pay raise, were included in their March 9 paychecks, Walmart said. For the full fiscal year, U.S. associates shared more than $700 million in bonuses, the company said. Walmart also touted its program to advance and promote workers: * Walmart U.S. promoted more than 200,000 associates, including 2,397 in Massachusetts, to jobs with higher pay and more responsibility. * More than 150,000 associates, including 1,285 in Massachusetts were converted from part-time to full-time. The profit sharing and bonuses come after Walmart sustained several years of public protests and criticism relating to the wages paid to associates.  MASSLIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA MassLive News on Facebook MassLive News on Twitter MassLive on YouTube Breaking News newsletter When the big stories break, we'll send you an alert.

Wal-Mart de Mexico, Mexico's biggest retailer, plans to increase spending by nearly 19 percent in 2017, upgrading and adding new stores and investing in e-commerce, a top executive said on Tuesday. Walmex, as the company is known, will spend 17 billion pesos ($864.80 million) in 2017, above the 14.3 billion pesos they spent last year, Chief Financial Officer Pedro Farah told investors during a company presentation. Walmex continues to see opportunities to add stores and has become more efficient with its construction projects, according to Gaston Wainstein, Walmex head of real estate. However, Central America head Carlos Arroyo said the region is not growing as quickly as the company would like, which is limiting the number of stores it is prepared to build there. Walmex also said it is paying 35 percent more in bonuses to its low-level employees this year than it did a year ago. It also plans to open a second meat-cutting plant in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey, executives said on Tuesday. Executives from the retailer, controlled by Wal-Mart Stores Inc, repeatedly emphasized investments in e-commerce. "We don't think e-commerce is a loss leader," said Philip Behn, Walmex's head of eCommerce, calling it a driver of growth, profit and capital efficiency.

(AP) — A federal judge has vacated a nearly $1 million trademark infringement award made to the owners of the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally brand. Sturgis Motorcycle Rally Inc., which owns the Sturgis logo, sued Walmart and a Rapid City retailer for allegedly improperly using the Sturgis trademark on merchandise. A jury awarded $912,500 to SMRI following a civil trial in October 2015, the Rapid City Journal reported (http://bit.ly/2mnnZYY ). Federal Judge Jeffrey Viken upheld SMRI's trademark rights, but set aside the jury award against the defendants. In the trial, the two companies said that the Sturgis Chamber of Commerce lied when it convinced the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to grant the "Sturgis" trademark. The argument was that because Sturgis is a geographical name, it could not be trademarked. The jury still disagreed, deciding in favor of SMRI. Minneapolis attorney Aaron Davis represented Rushmore Photos & Gifts in Rapid City and Walmart. "Judge Viken upheld SMRI's trademark rights per se, but the damages finding against the defendants has been vacated, dismissed basically," Davis said. "There is no money judgment that survives this court order." He said the ruling doesn't mean the case is over, pending an appeal by the plaintiffs. But he said the judge's decision is "a huge burden off of our clients." Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

"We weren't overjoyed with the judge's ruling deferring to the jury that SMRI had the (trademark) rights and that may be a point of appeal in the future," Davis said. "We feel strongly that they don't have any rights to this trademark at all." ___ Information from: Rapid City Journal, http://www.rapidcityjournal.com Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

McMillon was one of the speakers at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Investor Conference in New York City. McMillon said he and Wal-Mart CFO Brett Biggs joked on the flight that they might have to converse among themselves given the blustery winter storm Stella which had blanketed the city in snow this morning. “It’s really nice that you made it; appreciate that,” McMillon said as he took the stage. McMillon outlined a few key objectives that has Wal-Mart’s complete focus, which aside from saving people money and time involves the company’s digital transformation. That conversion is not just on the outside customer-facing areas like mobile pay or the skip-the-line feature added to the mobile application. McMillon said it’s equally important to change on the inside. “We were born with a low cost mindset,” McMillon said. “But, as time goes on and the company gets bigger and older, you inherit bureaucracy, layers and expense and in some cases we don’t need. We’ve been trying to chip away at that, but we’ve got more of a transformation to go through. We’ll keep working on the conventional ways to reduce cost. But we’re really excited about changing how we work inside the company to be digital in size, not just with the things that customers need, but how we actually do work.” McMillon said the retailer is not only using digital capabilities to enhance customer shopping experiences. It’s also figuring out how the technologies may allow employees to work more efficiently. For instance, he said in the past he might have asked a store manager to run a report for him, but now the data is readily available automatically on a mobile application. He said store managers can now run stores largely through the use of mobile applications, reducing time and overhead costs. “We must do that in the home office, which will increase our speed,” McMillon said. In the past year, McMillon said his leadership team has been reading and talking about design thinking and talking with others about what it means to be a digital enterprise. He said they’ve also brought in guest speakers from digitally native companies to talk about it. McMillon has been around Wal-Mart a long time, and he confessed one of his biggest challenges is not flooding the engine with too many ideas. “We have to be able to execute,” he added. “But it’s a really exciting time to be in our business.” Analysts asked McMillon about discount competitors Lidl and Aldi. He said Wal-Mart doesn’t underestimate those companies as competitors, but the retailer will look to win where it can, and that’s primarily on assortment and offering multiple channel options. When asked if the retailer would consider creating alternative ancillary profit streams the way Amazon does with its advertising and cloud services, McMillon admitted the company could and should do more of that. He said Wal-Mart’s board of directors and leadership team regularly discuss areas they want and need to be more involved. He said that includes different categories, geographies and formats. He said the company must be thoughtful about what areas to expand reach and not get too far from “the core DNA.” “But there are things that are closer to the core of what we do,” McMillon concluded. “Financial services would be one, health and wellness is an area where we think we have an opportunity that we probably need to be more aggressive. So, it could be in the future that you see us be more deliberate about creating additional profit pools. That’s certainly on the agenda and we’re thinking about lots of things, and many of which you could probably guess. But we will be really thoughtful and deliberate about those kinds of choices including managing our existing portfolio.” Wal-Mart Stores shares (NYSE: WMT) closed Tuesday at $70.72, up 1.10% on the day. Over the past 52-week period shares traded from a high $75.19 to a low $62.72.

On March 4, a caller with a restricted number made two phone calls "claiming to be bringing a bomb to the Jasper Walmart," the release said. Two days later, a bomb threat was made to Whataburger on South Wheeler Street, Jasper PD said. They were able to obtain a cell phone number from that call, and police were able to identify the suspects in both calls. "It was learned that the suspects were juveniles playing phone pranks," the release said. A 15-year-old will be charged with a class A misdemeanor, making a terroristic threat, for the Walmart call, Jasper PD said. Whataburger did not pursue charges. The teen has not yet been arrested, the release said. "Investigators are in the process of obtaining a warrant."

You took the time to turn my purse into the customer service department, and Walmart was able to contact me and return my purse. The outstanding thing about this was that nothing was missing. I pray that the Lord will richly bless you for doing this and for your honesty. A heartfelt thank you to the staff at Walmart who were so kind to me when I came in so upset about my purse. We hear so many bad things that happen, I just wanted to share some good news. I consider this a miracle from the Lord. Thank you so much Carol Horton Mooreville Click here to leave a comment!

It must benefit the overall mission and not just one or two supervisors. I want all of you to give and take from each and come out with a strong policy that benefits our mission. Right now we pay our people both in congress and the senate to support our State and the USA. What I see is each party stick together and it’s all yes or all no. That hurts our state and country because we just go to our corners and nothing passes that benefits our state or country. We could save a lot of money by just keeping our congressional people home and let them mailing it in. Back around the sixty both party work together for the good of all, but no more.

Should You? A few famous investors hit the sell button on these five stocks in the fourth quarter. Should individual investors follow their lead? Brian Feroldi, Dan Caplinger, Rich Duprey, Jason Hall, and Jordan Wathen (TMFTypeoh) Mar 14, 2017 at 12:02PM Billionaire investors such as Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn, and George Soros have minted themselves a fortune by staying one step ahead of the markets. That's why we Fools like to dig through SEC filings each quarter to see what these brilliant investors have been buying or selling recently.  After digging through those filings, our team of Fool contributors noticed that these investors have been selling off their positions in Barrick Gold (NYSE:ABX), Transocean (NYSE:RIG), Seadrill Ltd. (NYSE:SDRL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). Is it a good idea to follow suit? Image source: Getty Images. Looking for riches under the sea Dan Caplinger (Transocean): The offshore-drilling industry has been a tough place to make money lately, and many investors have started to lose faith in Transocean and its peers. Late last year, well-known activist investor and billionaire Carl Icahn slashed his position in Transocean, citing the need to take tax losses but also having suffered a dramatic decline in the value of the stock since his initial investment. Transocean and offshore drillers in general have been among the hardest hit in the industry, largely because the projects that rely on the company's drilling rigs tend to be more expensive than land-based exploration activity. When oil prices were above $100 per barrel, the higher potential reward made offshore drilling worth the effort, and that helped push demand for drilling equipment much higher. Yet when the energy market went into the tank, Transocean found itself with clients who no longer wanted to move full steam ahead on expensive offshore projects. In the aftermath, gluts of equipment have contributed to lower contract rates. Currently, Transocean is at a turning point. Current oil prices have rebounded somewhat, but they still aren't high enough to justify a return to full capacity. If oil rises further, then Transocean is in a position to recover its losses. But if oil sags, it could spell a long-term problem for Transocean and its growth prospects.  Does gold still glitter? Rich Duprey (Barrick Gold): Considering his track record lately, investors might not want to follow the moves billionaire investor George Soros is making these days, but he's not a billionaire for nothing. Soros Fund Management reportedly lost $1 billion betting against a market rally following Donald Trump's election and in the fourth quarter dumped all of its holdings in Barrick Gold, only to see shares of the miner surge this year. While it had jumped as much as 50% between its mid-December lows and the peak it hit mid-February, it's eased back a bit since, and investors should consider which way it will go from here. After all, Soros' biggest sin may have been simply selling too early -- but if we look at Barrick Gold's bigger picture, I'd say no, don't follow Soros' lead here. In its fourth-quarter earnings report last month, the gold miner reduced its all-in sustaining costs (AISC) to just $732 per ounce, or 40% below gold's current price. It shows that the cost-cutting initiatives Barrick has implemented are bearing fruit, and the gains are expected to accelerate this year, with AISC falling even further. The gold miner has paid off a good chunk of its long-term debt, and though it still carries some $8 billion worth on its balance sheet, there isn't much coming due anytime soon. Moreover, Barrick owns five core mines that should produce 70% of its volumes this year, with ore grades that are more than double that of the miner's peer group. It also expects to produce some 5.9 million ounces this year, or 5% more than in 2016. There's good reason to keep betting on gold generally and Barrick Gold in particular, and following George Soros in dumping your shares might just tarnish your portfolio. Giving the thumbs-down to this social network Brian Feroldi (Facebook): With a net worth of roughly $13 billion, Steven Cohen is one of the most successful hedge fund managers in the world. That's why it caught my attention when I found out that Point72 Asset Management -- one of Cohen's hedge funds -- dumped 96% of his position in Facebook in the fourth quarter.  If you look at the numbers, you might be scratching your head as to why Cohen would want to give up on Facebook right now. Last quarter, Facebook's revenue surged 51% while expenses grew by only 29%. The difference caused margins to balloon and allowed EPS to more than double. Those are impressive figures for any company, let alone a megacap like Facebook. Beyond the financials, Facebook's community also continues to thrive. The company welcomes 1.86 billion unique visitors a month, up 17% from the year-ago period. What's even more amazing is that 1.23 billion users interact with the site every day. That's telling about how much value users get from the site.  Given those terrific results, my hunch is that Cohen is worried that Facebook's revenue is going to significantly decelerate in the years ahead. That's a legitimate concern now that the company's ad load is leveling off. Furthermore, expenses are expected to continue to rise significantly as the company adds engineering talent. That could lead to a meaningful slowdown in profits. With shares trading near an all-time high, perhaps he wanted to cash in his chips while he could.  Regardless of Cohen's move, I for one couldn't be more excited about Facebook's long-term potential. That's why I have no intentions to part ways with my shares anytime soon. Big investors selling this troubled offshore driller (and you probably should, too)  Jason Hall (Seadrill Ltd.): After the company disclosed in its most recent quarterly earnings filing that Chapter 11 bankruptcy is on the table, investors of every ilk -- not just billionaires -- have been selling off shares of Seadrill. And for good reason, since the company is facing more than $1 billion in debt it must pay off between now and June, with hundreds of millions of it maturing at the end of April.  As things stand today, the writing's on the wall that the company won't pay off that first debt maturity, which would put it in default on essentially all of its long-term debt soon after.  Should you follow the rest of Seadrill's investors to the exits? Probably, yes, if you have capital at risk that you really can't afford to lose. The offshore-drilling industry remains an awful business right now. Offshore oil and gas producers are on track to spend less capital this year than anytime in the past decade-plus.  There's still a chance that Seadrill can turn things around and come to terms with its debt holders, in which case today's price will end up being a bargain. If you're willing to take on that risk -- and acknowledge you could end up with nothing -- there's a case for staying invested. Just don't be shocked if it doesn't work out.  Another sign of retail doom Jordan Wathen (Wal-Mart): Warren Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, nearly blew out of its billion-dollar position in Wal-Mart in the most recent quarter. And while Wal-Mart may have been a small part of Berkshire's portfolio, few likely know more about Wal-Mart than Warren Buffett does. In May 2003, Berkshire Hathaway acquired a little-known Wal-Mart subsidiary known as McLane Company, a distributor of groceries and foods to stores all around the country. Shortly after that acquisition, in 2005, Berkshire purchased shares of Wal-Mart, perhaps having learned to appreciate the retailer's operations after observing it through McLane Company. More than a decade after Berkshire's investment, Buffett apparently wants out. Wal-Mart finds itself situated between fierce competition in grocery and general merchandise. In grocery, competitors such as Aldi, which has quietly opened more than 1,600 stores in the U.S., many of which are located in proximity to Wal-Mart stores, competes directly on price for core grocery items including milk and produce. In general merchandise, online stores such as Amazon.com have the lead in distribution and can deliver products directly to their customers' doors, often at a better price. Buffett has shared his praise for Amazon's CEO, Jeff Bezos, telling CNBC last May, "We haven't seen many businessmen like him." Keep in mind that Berkshire is awash in cash and prefers to leave gains unharvested rather than collect its winnings and pay taxes. That Berkshire is reassessing its stake in Wal-Mart should give shareholders pause about the company, and retail in general. Brian Feroldi owns shares of Amazon and Facebook.

Keeping up with employment norms, Asda, the Walmart-owned British retailer, has offered a ‘flexible’ deal to its staff – BBC reports. The proposed contract changes, which Asda claim staff will not be forced to sign, will see wages rise to £8.50 an hour in exchange for Bank Holiday work requirements and unpaid breaks. This means that staff must work on bank holidays if told to, and if they want time off it must come out of their 28-day annual leave. Changes will also affect night shift staff who are currently paid an extra £2.04 an hour between 10pm and 6am. The new agreement will see Asda shorten what it recognises as unsociable hours to between midnight and 5am. However, the premium rate will rise to an additional £2.54 an hour. Asda claims 95% of its staff will be better off under the new deal. Asda said it was "maintaining its commitment not to use zero hours contracts and colleagues will be guaranteed minimum hours". They continued: "The new contract will require colleagues to be flexible [and] fair . . . reasonable notice will be given for any changes to rotas and consideration will be given to those with care requirements outside of work." Speaking to the BBC, Katherine Chapman, Director of the Living Wage Foundation, welcomed the changes at Britain’s third-largest supermarket chain: “This is a welcome pay rise for Asda's staff, however, large national retailers like Ikea, Lush and Majestic Wine are already paying all their staff - including third party contractors - the real Living Wage or above at £8.45 in the UK and £9.75 in London for every hour worked.” Roadmap to Change Management Crown Workforce Management Systems has produced a free downloadable white paper on key milestones to... Read more Amanda Powell Smith, CEO at Forster Communications, believes that the flexible working hours will benefit both businesses and the staff they employ. She said: “Flexible working needs to be recognised as a massive opportunity for both employer and employee [especially] with workers who stay into their 60s and 70s as the norm, challenging current preconceptions and forcing new ways of working.” Aldi is currently the UK’s highest-paying supermarket with staff, outside of London, earning £8.53 an hour. Lidl plan to offer an £8.45 per hour wage, outside of London, from March. Tesco have pledged to pay shop staff at least £7.62 an hour from this summer. An anonymous Glasdoor review, from a shop assistant at an Asda store in Belfast, said that working at Asda has lots of pros, including: “Flexible working hours; plenty of overtime if wanted; no huge pressure to take extra hours if doesn't suit; competitive pay for young people; straightforward work; friendly managers (mostly); ten per cent staff discount after three months.” Michael Hibbs, employment law partner at Shakespeare Martineau, offered his opinions on Asda’s introduction of a new flexible contract. He said: “This could be the new model for the sector. Adopting a flexible approach to contracts, such as zero-hour contract, has previously come with the stigma of being unfair on the employee. It is likely that this type of flexible contract will not suit everyone; however, the voluntary nature of the arrangement at this stage will give employees the option. However, whether Asda will put some gentle pressure on employees is of course not clear at this stage.

(AP) — A federal judge has vacated a nearly $1 million trademark infringement award made to the owners of the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally brand. Sturgis Motorcycle Rally Inc., which owns the Sturgis logo, sued Walmart and a Rapid City retailer for allegedly improperly using the Sturgis trademark on merchandise. A jury awarded $912,500 to SMRI following a civil trial in October 2015, the Rapid City Journal reported (http://bit.ly/2mnnZYY ). Federal Judge Jeffrey Viken upheld SMRI's trademark rights, but set aside the jury award against the defendants. In the trial, the two companies said that the Sturgis Chamber of Commerce lied when it convinced the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to grant the "Sturgis" trademark. The argument was that because Sturgis is a geographical name, it could not be trademarked. The jury still disagreed, deciding in favor of SMRI. Minneapolis attorney Aaron Davis represented Rushmore Photos & Gifts in Rapid City and Walmart. "Judge Viken upheld SMRI's trademark rights per se, but the damages finding against the defendants has been vacated, dismissed basically," Davis said. "There is no money judgment that survives this court order." He said the ruling doesn't mean the case is over, pending an appeal by the plaintiffs. But he said the judge's decision is "a huge burden off of our clients." "We weren't overjoyed with the judge's ruling deferring to the jury that SMRI had the (trademark) rights and that may be a point of appeal in the future," Davis said. "We feel strongly that they don't have any rights to this trademark at all." ___ Information from: Rapid City Journal, http://www.rapidcityjournal.com Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

Angela D. Benton, 36, no address listed, was arrested at about 10 after the incident at the Walmart at 3111 Browns Mill Road. Police said several bondsmen were trying to take Benton into custody on outstanding warrants. Police said Benton used her vehicle to intentionally ram two vehicles as she tried to escape. Damage costs estimates for each vehicle set charges at a felony level, and one vehicle was occupied by a bondsman when it was rammed. That bondsman, along with two others alongside Benton’s vehicle, were placed in immediate danger by the defendant’s actions, police said. Benton was charged with three counts of reckless endangerment by motor vehicle, leaving the scene of an accident with damage, leaving the scene of an accident involving an unattended vehicle, two counts of felony vandalism and a second offense of driving on a revoked license. She was held in the Washington County Detention Center on $32,000 bond awaiting a Sessions Court appearance set for Monday.

Watch out!

(CRI) Stock Shows Promise in Retail Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT) Criticizes Border Tax, And Rightfully So View All Posts There has been a lot of buzz around Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP), more commonly known as Snapchat, since SNAP stock went public last Thursday and traded more than its 200,000 share float in just its first day. Source: Shutterstock The offering was priced at $17, but SNAP stock opened at $24 and closed at $24.48. On Friday it continued higher, topping out at $29.44 before turning back last week to hit a low of $20.64 on Tuesday. A lot of folks who bought the first two days are looking at losses, and shareholders who got in at the IPO price are hopeful that amazing debut doesn’t vanish into thin air. It’s too early to see where the company and stock might be a year from now, but there are cautionary tales from past hot tech IPOs worth visiting. Where SNAP Stock May Be Headed Theglobe.com, inc. (OTCMKTS:TGLO) saw a couple of college undergrads take the concept of chat rooms public, and that set the world on fire. On Nov. 13, 1998, The Globe’s initial price was offered at $9. Once it began trading it rallied all the way to $97 before settling at $63 for a record one-day gain of 606%. In many ways, this took the tech IPO market into overdrive and got a number of Americans thinking they would “play” the market and retire at 40. One of the founders was known for hitting the town in leather pants with his model girlfriend. It’s not known what happened to the pants or the girl, as the stock eventually worked its way to penny stock territory. If the Globe took the tech bubble into overdrive, it was World Online that erected its brick wall. The Dutch tech company was billed as the America Online for Europe and Africa. It was successful with growing subscribers, but there was the issue of profits. However, that’s not where the deathblow came from. There was one hell of a party that day on March 17, 2000, as the stock was oversubscribed 21 times. When trading began, the shares skyrocketed. By the closing bell, they were unchanged at 43 euros, but still sported a 12 billion euro valuation. In the midst of the party, someone asked founder Nina Brink what she thought of the action and what she was going to do with her newfound wealth. That’s when she admitted to having already sold her entire 10% stake in a private transaction for only 6 euros per share. The stock went into freefall. A week later, the S&P 500 hit an all-time high and began to implode. I’d say it was a sobering wake-up call — everyone had been suckered and the game was over. I’m not saying SNAP is either theglobe.com or World Online, but now all the unicorns are going to come public, and some will be dogs looking for suckers to finish the “Greater Fool Theory,” so be careful.

The autopsy released on Friday showed that Orlando Police Lt. Debra Clayton was shot four times, including in the neck and stomach. David HarrisContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton was shot four times, including in the neck and stomach, her autopsy released Friday showed. Clayton was killed Jan. 9 while confronting a murder suspect in a Wal-Mart parking lot. The autopsy confirmed much of what was previously released. One shot entered her neck at a downward angle, suggesting that she was on the ground when she was hit. The bullet partially exited her left upper back, according to the autopsy. Police previously said this was the fatal shot, although the autopsy did not specify. She also was shot in the lower stomach, buttocks and thigh. Clayton, 42, suffered cuts and bruises on her face. She did not have any alcohol or drugs in her system. Police say she was at the Wal-Mart on Princeton Street and John Young Parkway when someone came up to her and said they had spotted Markeith Loyd, who was wanted on murder charges in the death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon. When she confronted the 41-year-old Loyd, he opened fire, striking her in the thigh. She returned fire and hit him in the chest, but he was protected by a bulletproof vest. According to police, Loyd continued shooting even after Clayton fell to the ground. Clayton’s killing set off a massive manhunt for Loyd. It ended nine days later when he was arrested at an abandoned house. He’s charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of Clayton and Dixon, and faces a slew of other charges, including shooting at an Orange County deputy. Loyd is being held without bond at the Orange County Jail. dharris@orlandosentinel.com, 407-420-5471 or @DavidHarrisOS Caption Seminole High School student shot A student was shot outside Seminole High School in Sanford.

Amazon ranked as the world’s most valuable retail brand in the annual study by valuation and strategy consultancy Brand Finance. The company’s brand value, $106.4 billion, is nearly double that of Walmart ($62.2 billion), which ranked as the second most valuable retail brand. (An explanation of the ranking is provided at the end of article.)  Amazon also ranked as the third most valuable brand across all industries, just behind Google ($109.5 billion) and Apple ($107.1 billion). “The firm (amazon) is growing strongly as it continues to both reshape the retail market and to capture an ever larger share of it,” stated Brand Finance in a release. “Its brand value is already nearly double that of second-placed Walmart. Amazon Fresh, its grocery service, is still relatively limited in scale but this year began operating overseas for the first time, serving Central and East London initially. Rounding out the top five most valuable retail brands were Alibaba, with a brand value of $34.9 billion; The Home Depot, $30.2 billion; and Ikea, at $24.1 billion. Other top ranking retail brands included CVS, No. 6 with a brand value of $23.2 billion; Target, No.7 (brand value of $17 billion; Walgreens, No. 8 ($16 billion); Lowe’s, No.9 ($14 billion); and Costco, No.10 ($13.4 billion). The brands in the Brand Finance study are first evaluated to determine their power / strength (based on factors such as marketing investment, familiarity, loyalty, staff satisfaction and corporate reputation) and given a corresponding letter grade up to AAA+. Brand strength is used to determine what proportion of a business’s revenue is contributed by the brand, which is projected into perpetuity to determine the brand’s value.  Login or Register to post a comment. ﻿ Newsletter Sign Up Get the latest news sent to your inbox   Popular Most Commented Lowe’s by the numbers Evolution in the power tool aisle True Value makes gains in 2016 Bankruptcy for hhgregg In Search of: The Smartest Home in America HBSDealer Stock Watch: HBP jumps ahead Westlake paints a picture of growth Home furnishings giant plugs in another fuel cell system Study: More than half of U.S. shoppers haven’t tried BOPIS Readers Respond: Not so up-to-date Poll Poll When was your store's last major IT improvement project?

Independent Mail , KHOU 9:06 PM. CDT March 13, 2017 (Photo: Michael Madrid, USA TODAY) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST ANDERSON, S.C. — A Girl Scout's mother was punched and kicked as she tried to stop someone from stealing a money box from a cookie stand outside of the Powdersville Walmart on Sunday afternoon, according to an Anderson County Sheriff's Office report. Juli Spann has been volunteering with Girl Scouts for nearly two decades. She said she's sold cookies dozens of times over the years. Spann and her daughter were selling cookies around 2:15 p.m. Sunday when a woman came out of a black Jeep and went to a vending machine before asking if the Scouts had a newer $1 bill, according to a deputy's report. The women exchanged money and the woman from the Jeep went back to her vehicle several times before picking up several boxes of cookies and asking the driver of the Jeep what kind of cookies she wanted, according to the Sheriff's Office report. Spann said the woman paid $4 and grabbed a box containing about $300 from the Scouts' sales. The woman held the box for a few moments and stared at the girls before leaving, according to Spann, who said her daughter initially thought the woman was just joking with them. When Spann realized the woman was stealing the money, she tried to take the box back. "I wasn't going to let the girls lose that hard earned money," she said. There was a struggle for the money box and the thief punched and kicked Spann before getting into the Jeep to leave, according to Spann. The Girl Scout, whose age was not made public in the report, also tried to get the money back. According to Spann, employees and customers at Walmart also tried to help. Once the woman got away, Spann said Walmart employees spread the word that the money had been stolen and the troop saw an immediate increase in sales. Donations made since the incident have more than made up for what was lost, according to Karen Kelly, director of marketing and communications for Girl Scouts South Carolina-Mountains to Midlands. An emotional Spann said the most difficult thing about the theft was feeling like she let the girls down by not getting the box back, but she knows she did everything she could. "That woman was bold and brazen and no matter what we would've done, she would've taken it," she said. The deputy's report said video from Walmart confirms an assault on the volunteer and the theft of the money box. Spann said she didn't have any major injuries, but her hand was in some pain and she has a compression fracture in one vertebra. In a statement, a Walmart spokesman said customers and employees gave donations to the Girl Scouts after the theft. "It was great to see our associates and customers step forward to help these young ladies recoup the money they lost," the company said in the statement.   USA TODAY CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Investigation continues into report of shots fired at rodeo Viewer video: Chaos at RodeoHouston after reports of possible shooting 3 in custody after robbery at Pappas BBQ HPD responding to possible shooting at rodeo Popular gas station chain, Buc-ee's, sues roadside competitor Firefighters tackle blaze at refinery in Houston KHOU 11 Breaking News Navasota Train Death Vigil Rodeo attendees exit stadium following possible shooting Deadly fire in SE Houston More Stories Two arrests made in connection with suicide of Texas… Mar 16, 2017, 1:40 p.m. HPD: Bullet casing found on rodeo grounds, man arrested Mar 15, 2017, 10:03 p.m. 2 killed in fire at boarding house in SE Houston Mar 16, 2017, 4:40 a.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home Weather Health Detail Closings & Delays Location Search Radars Conditions Hurricane Central More...

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) (Photo: Scott Olson, 2009 Getty Images) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST The owners of Neiman Marcus are weighing whether to sell the famed department store chain as it struggles in an era of declining visits by shoppers -- and one potential buyer has already signaled its interest. Neiman Marcus Group said in a statement that it is “undertaking a process to explore and evaluate potential strategic alternatives, which include the sale of the company or other assets.’’ The announcement came as the retail company reported a loss of $117.1 million in the quarter that ended Jan. 28, as compared to the $7.8 million profit the company eked out during the same three-month period a year earlier. Neiman is among retail's most iconic department stores which are struggling to survive at a time when a growing number of consumers are choosing the ease of shopping online with Amazon, or gravitating toward the discounts and all-in-one shopping experience available at big box giants like Walmart. Sears announced in January that it would close 150 stores and sell its Craftsman tool brand, while Macy's closed 66 locations in its last fiscal year and is planning to close another 34 stores. In the case of Neiman Marcus, a potential suitor has already appeared. Canadian retailer Hudson's Bay which had reportedly been considering a merger with Macy's, is now interested in acquiring Neiman Marcus instead, according to CNBC, citing sources who spoke to Dow Jones. Hudson's Bay had been trying to secure funding to potentially purchase Macy's according to previous reports. But investors were hesitant about a deal that would anchor them in shopping malls which are seeing declining shopper visits. Now, Hudson's Bay is reportedly turning its attention to Neiman Marcus, which it would like to buy if it can find a way to deal with the chain's nearly $5 billion in debt, according to the CNBC report. A company spokesperson for Hudson's Bay said that the retailer does not comment on rumors or speculation, but "generally speaking, as we have previously stated,  we selectively evaluate opportunities to accelerate the company’s strategic growth while maintaining or enhancing its credit profile.'' Neiman Marcus, which was purchased in 2013 by Ares Management and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, planned an initial public offering in 2015 that would have helped to reduce the debt, according to Reorg Research. But in January, Neiman's owners formally withdrew their bid to go public, Reorg Research says.

In a letter Tuesday to congressional leaders, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg, who is chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association, or AIA, this year, expressed the group’s strong support for measures it described as “comprehensive reforms of our tax code.” That puts all 330 companies in the aerospace lobbying group firmly on the side of what’s called the border adjustment tax, which they say will stimulate U.S. manufacturing jobs. The tax-system reform package is hugely controversial and opposed in particular by large retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target, which say it will cause steep price increases for consumers. Muilenburg — along with the CEOs of other major corporations including GE, Caterpillar, United Technologies, Raytheon, Oracle and Merck — had already last month joined the American Made Coalition that is lobbying for the change. In a separate statement, AIA Chief Executive David Melcher described the current U.S. tax system as “broken” and not globally competitive. “We need a modern tax system which creates a level playing field with the rest of the world in order to locate and grow jobs, manufacturing and profits inside the United States,” Melcher said. The plan, proposed by House Speaker Paul Ryan and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Kevin Brady, represents a structural shift from taxing bottom-line corporate profits to taxing companies through their cash flow. If the Ryan plan becomes law, every time an item is sold in the U.S., the sales revenue would be taxable at 20 percent, with deductions allowed for labor and inventory costs. Another boost to business is that capital investment — such as the billions of dollars Boeing invests in its assembly plants — would be immediately deductible in the year the money is spent, instead of being accounted for through depreciation over many years. The most controversial piece of the proposal is the “border adjustment” element, which would exempt U.S. exports from the tax entirely, while imports would be taxed at 20 percent. President Donald Trump was initially cool to the plan but recently seems to have come around to the idea. “I certainly support a form of tax on the border, because everybody else does,” Mr. Trump told Reuters last month. Bloomberg News reported that top Trump strategist Steve Bannon is an enthusiastic backer, citing a person familiar with discussions between Bannon and Ryan. A company like Boeing, a huge net exporter, is likely to come out well ahead. The impact on other companies will vary according to how much they import. How other countries might react to the tax on imports is uncertain. Proponents of the new system insist it won’t distort the trade balance. But some experts are skeptical and believe U.S. trading partners, including perhaps China, could impose retaliatory tariffs — potentially even triggering a destructive trade war. Nonetheless, the AIA leadership, in its letter, urges Congress “to act now.” Filed under: Airplane, Boeing, Republican, Tax Print Email Gmail Related Boeing CEO Sees “Near Term” Plane Deal After Trump Meeting Trump Denies Air Force One Threat Is Retaliation for Boeing CEO’s Comments Boeing Says Dennis Muilenburg Will Become CEO on July 1 Boeing Boosts Stock-Buyback Plan By $10 Billion Boeing Nears Deal to Sell Jetliners to Iran More in Business Asian Share Markets Gain, U.S. Dollar Weaker After Fed Hike Business Briefs – March 15, 2017 Stocks Climb, Led by Energy Companies and Dividend Payers Fed Hikes Key Rate for Second Time in 3 Months Ahead of Fed Announcement, Stocks Climb, Led By Gains in Energy Companies OP-ED The Intelligence Committee’s Hearing On Russia Won’t Satisfy Democrats A Head Start on Discrimination Antidote to Amalek More Can Be Done for Missing IDF Soldiers Mitzvos and “Making It” More Than a Buzz Cellphone Withdrawal Down the Conspiracy Rabbit Hole Laziness isn’t why People are Poor, iPhones Aren’t why they Lack Health Care.

Trump spoke in his first speech to a joint session of Congress. Despite the negative reputation Trump carried from his past, his speech to Congress seemed to change the tune of his public speaking skills and his presidency as a whole. “I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength,” Trump said. “A message that is deeply delivered from my heart.” Trump began the speech in regards to Black History Month and civil liberty. From that point forward, he discussed his ideal nation: a place bonded together, standing against injustice. Trump spent the majority of his speech focused on American renewal within his Presidency. Weaved into this message, he broadly discussed practical issues within the nation. One major reoccurring theme throughout the President’s speech was the creation of new jobs. “Since my election,” President Trump said. “Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.” He also mentioned how the constructions of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines and the use of American-made steel would generate jobs within the country. President Trump noted the large impact that improving business conditions in America would have on the economy and American workers. “Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world,” Trump said. “My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.” President Trump also mentioned reforming the system of legal immigration, which he noted could impact job availability as well. “The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers,” Trump said. “Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others — have a merit-based immigration system. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.” According to President Trump, discontinuing the current system of immigration in the U.S. and switching to the merit-based system could save countless dollars, raise workers’ wages and help struggling families enter the middle class. President Trump mentioned other methods of creating jobs, as well as “draining the swamp,” defeating ISIS, repealing Obamacare and engaging in a new system of “fair trade.” “As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS — a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs,” Trump said. “We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.” President Trump also urged members of both parties to pass an education bill that would fund school choice for disadvantaged youth and allow them to attend their school of choice. Trump spoke about about supporting police and sheriffs within our local communities as well as the victims of crimes. “I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. The office is called VOICE — Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests,” he said. President Trump also mentioned sending Congress a new budget that “rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history” as well as the American foreign policy. “We will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations,” he said. “Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people — and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America. But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict — not more.” While President Trump did not go into great detail, he used his new plans as a symbol of renewal in order to motivate the American Congress. “I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country,” Trump said. “And I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and believe in yourselves. Believe in your future. And believe, once more, in America.” Overall, Trump’s speech received good reviews. Journalist and founder of Citizen University, Eric Liu, discussed his opinion of Trump’s speech with CNN. “This speech was his most effective moment as president,” Liu said. “It played to his natural strengths — performance and theatricality — while keeping his liabilities, like cynical incuriosity and casual cruelty, at bay.” However, others were displeased with the topics discussed in the speech itself. Within his speech, the President seemed to have disregarded planned details for the future. Jen Pskai, journalist and former White House Director of Communications, expressed her opinions on Trump’s speech. “The goal of such an address is to give marching orders for the months ahead,” Psaki said. “But Trump failed to lay out a specific path to achieve his policy objectives.” Throughout the evening, Trump used a poetic, generic tone. This style may be beneficial for the Trump administration to keep the peace and focus away from President Trump’s controversial Executive Orders. Trump’s first Executive Order, announced in late January, suspended entry for citizens of seven Muslim majority countries into the United States during 90 days. This order was denied by a three-judge panel who deemed that the ban did not advance national security. According to the New York Times, the panel declared that there is “‘no evidence’ which showed that anyone from the seven nations — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — had committed terrorist acts in the United States.” After the negativity and anger that sprouted from this order, the Trump administration decided to wait before taking action again. At the end of Trump’s speech, Daily Mail Political Editor, David Martosko tweeted, “A senior admin. official says the ‘revised’ travel ban order will be signed later in the week. They don’t want to step on tonight’s big win.” Although Trump has not held the highest of reputations, joint-congressional speech in his joint-congressional message placed him in a new light. “From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears,” Trump said. “Inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past, and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.” Sharing Twitter0 Facebook0 Google +0 Linkedin0 Email this article Print this article Authors Katrina Williams The Clause News President Trump addresses Congress for the first time Site index Clause Mission Statement The Clause is a student publication dedicated to providing a realistic educational experience for students of Azusa Pacific University; to seeking truth and reporting it boldly, fairly, and accurately; to enhancing the University community by providing a student voice imbued with truth, responsibility and accountability.

The trial of Christopher Whetstone, 48, began Tuesday. He is charged with the murder of Rachel Taylor, 22, who died of two gunshot wounds to her chest and stomach Jan. 13, 2014, after being found on the 500 block of Charles Street on Aurora's west side. If convicted of murder, Whetstone faces a prison term of 20 to 60 years, plus another 25-year add-on if jurors determine that he fired the shots that killed Taylor. Whetstone and Taylor had two children, ages 5 and 20 months when she was killed. They had lived with each other for nearly a year before Taylor moved out in fall 2013 to live with her mother in West Chicago, according to court testimony. Authorities said Taylor, a part-time worker at the Batavia Wal-Mart, was shot after a domestic dispute. Kane County Assistant State's Attorney Alex Bederka told jurors in his opening statement that Taylor was found shot three houses down from Whetstone's home. Witnesses say they saw Whetstone running from the scene, and police recovered spent .22 caliber shell casings near her body and inside her white Dodge Durango, which she had purchased earlier that day. Tests showed the presence of gunshot residue on Whetstone's hands after he was caught by police, Bederka said. Whetstone even asked an officer for a cigarette, saying it was going to be the last one he would have while free, Bederka added. "Christopher Whetstone shot Rachel Taylor for the worst reason of all," Bederka said. "Because he wanted to." But Assistant Public Defender Jackie Leder said Taylor was gunned down in a drive-by shooting. "That's how Rachel Taylor became a tragic victim on Jan. 13, 2014. It was a chaotic night in Aurora," Leder told jurors, noting how police had responded to a murder at a restaurant earlier that night. Whetstone ran away from the scene because he wanted to draw gunfire away from Taylor's Dodge Durango, where their children were buckled up in the back seat, Leder said. She said there were no eyewitnesses of the shooting, noted that police did not recover a gun and only focused on Whetstone as a suspect, and added that the initial 911 call from the shooting said a suspect vehicle was a black Nissan.

Ted S. Warren / AP Share Adjust Comment Print There will be a push by ride-hailing companies like Uber to get a pool of drivers signed up now that the provincial Liberal government has set a target of December for bringing their services to B.C. There are some telling examples of what drivers in other cities have faced as would-be drivers in B.C. try to figure out what wages and conditions Uber will offer here. Uber Canada says the number of drivers in B.C. who might be interested in working with them is in the tens of thousands, based on information sessions it has run over the last year in Kelowna, Victoria, Vancouver and Surrey. In Houston, meanwhile, there are drivers commuting several few hours to Austin so they can avoid working with Uber. Instead, they are opting to drive for smaller, ride-hailing companies that leave them with $100 or even $200 more at the end of each day than they would get with Uber, according to CNNMoney last week. Related B.C. to create new auto insurance for ride-hailing companies, taxi industry B.C. tech firms ready to vie with Uber for ride-hailing business Cab drivers balk at B.C. Liberal government welcoming the likes of Uber Uber and Lyft, another large ride-hailing company, decided to leave the Austin market last May because city officials there wanted their drivers to be fingerprinted. Their departure led to the flourishing of new and local apps such as Ride Austin and Fasten. In Houston, Uber drivers get 87 cents a mile, a figure that has dropped in recent years, said CNNMoney, which profiled one woman who got into financial trouble when Uber lowered its prices and changed its commission split. She eventually discovered that making the three hour trek from Houston to Austin was worth the trouble of sleeping in her car, which she would park “in an Austin Wal-Mart or apartment complex” every night from Thursday to Sunday. She now splits an apartment in Houston with three other drivers who also travel to Austin because they can earn more there than driving for Uber in Houston.  It’s typical for a company like Uber to court drivers with generous rates until it is the dominant player, said Sumeet Gulati, a UBC professor of environmental and resource economics, who has researched these ride-hailing companies.  After that, however, he worries that wages for drivers can fall to the point where they might not earn minimum wage. Doing informal research, Gulati talked to some drivers in Atlanta making as little as US$10 an hour during off-peak hours, and they had yet to account for expenses such as insurance and wear-and-tear on their car. He spoke to one woman who “lived in a nice neighbourhood and had a decent job and was trying to make some extra money to see a game” as well as a “programmer for Apple who was driving on his day off.” Said Gulati of the potential pressure on wages: “There is a lot of underused capital in North American cities. People have cars and have time.” At one point, Gulati paid an Uber driver in Atlanta a mere “$3 for a 40-minute ride. It was off-peak, but I started questioning if wages will fall to the point where people will stop driving or unionize.” In Seattle, Uber is suing the city after it approved a law that allows drivers for Uber and Lyft to unionize and collectively bargain for better working conditions, earnings and other benefits. Uber Canada official Susie Heath cited research by Princeton University professor Alan Krueger, who looked at the labour market for Uber drivers at the end of 2016, finding that hourly earnings (before expenses) remained stable even as prices fell and that hourly earnings aren’t related to how many hours a person drives per week. jlee-young@postmedia.com CLICK HERE to report a typo.

Penney Stock a Buy? The turnaround has ground to a halt, and the department store's strategy is a long shot. Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Mar 14, 2017 at 6:33PM Department store chain J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP) has successfully pulled itself back from the brink over the past few years. Sales are still seriously depressed, but the company expects to produce a meaningful adjusted profit this year, ending a long streak of losses. Gross margin has largely recovered, and operating costs have been slashed. Despite this progress, J.C. Penney hit a wall during the fourth quarter of 2016. Comparable sales slumped 0.7%, a disaster for a company that needs to grow sales at a brisk pace in order to have any chance at making a full recovery. This marked the second consecutive quarter of declining revenue, prompting investors to sell off the stock. With shares of J.C. Penney now trading for around $6, close to a 37-year low, investors looking for bargains are no doubt eyeing the beleaguered department store. J.C. Penney is now worth just $1.85 billion despite annual revenue of about $12.5 billion. But the risks outweigh the potential rewards, making the stock one to avoid. JCP data by YCharts The fundamental problem with J.C. Penney Department stores are not faring well, and that's not just a recent development. 2016 marked the 11th consecutive year of sales declines, a streak that doesn't look like it will let up anytime soon. Pressure from discounters like Wal-Mart and Target, specialty apparel chains, and online retailers like Amazon is taking a toll. This pressure is only going to intensify as more retail sales shift online. Brick-and-mortar retailers are going to need to become more aggressive to get customers into their stores. That means lower prices and lower margins. Announcements of store closings are becoming commonplace as weaker retailers attempt to downsize in order to survive. J.C. Penney announced plans to close as many as 140 stores after its weak holiday quarter. A sales decline wasn't the only problem with J.C. Penney's fourth-quarter report. Gross margin tumbled 100 basis points to 33.1%, with the decline driven by increased promotional activity. This need to spend heavily on markdowns and marketing in order to drive sales isn't going to go away. Cost-cutting and gains from real estate sales helped J.C. Penney break even during the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis, but the two most important numbers, comparable sales and gross margin, are moving in the wrong direction. Total U.S. retail sales in November and December of last year increased by 4%. Department stores, meanwhile, suffered a 7% sales decline. If J.C. Penney is having this much trouble despite generally strong retail sales, I don't see much hope for the company. J.C. Penney has a plan, but it's a long shot Marvin Ellison, who became CEO of J.C. Penney in August 2015 after being an executive at Home Depot for many years, has a plan to return the company to growth. The company is betting on its customers spending more on their homes and less on apparel. Major appliances made a return to J.C. Penney last year after decades of absence, and the company began testing initiatives to sell carpet and flooring. Image source: J.C. Penney. Earlier this month, J.C. Penney announced that it would begin offering turn-key services for heating and cooling systems, bathroom remodeling, installed blinds, and whole-home water solutions in some stores via partnerships with service providers and manufacturers. The company is betting that its customer base, 70% of which are female homeowners, will turn to J.C. Penney for these types of services. This isn't an unreasonable plan given the state of the department store industry, but the kind of transformation that J.C. Penney is attempting is a long shot. It seems like J.C. Penney is trying to become more like Sears, which is perhaps not the best path to take. J.C. Penney will have the opportunity to pick up market share as Sears continues to decline, but I'm not convinced a mall-based department store is a good platform for appliance and home services sales. J.C. Penney is worth less today than during the darkest depths of the financial crisis. The stock has dipped below the current level briefly over the past few years, but it's trading at about the same price as it was in 1980. The turnaround, which showed some progress over the past few years, has faltered. The plan is now to expand into new areas where J.C. Penney has no experience or competitive advantage. Investors would be wise to look elsewhere. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends AMZN. The Motley Fool recommends Home Depot.

(WISH photo) INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) – Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department’s administration has analyzed its pursuit policy for almost a year. Changes to the policy are on the horizon to ensure the policy is safe for citizens and officers. IMPD Chief Bryan Roach released statistics on pursuit numbers for police departments comparable or larger than Indianapolis. In June 2015, a vehicle that police were pursuing crashed into Donna Niblock, 63, and killed the grandmother. The crash injured LaDonna Rogers, 37, Indianapolis and an 11-year-old boy was also critically hurt in the crash. Police later arrested and charged 21-year-old Matthew Edmonds at the scene of South State Avenue and Prospect Street on the city’s southeast side. Police say that officers were pursuing Edmonds at one point for stealing a pair of jeans at a Wal-Mart. IMPD released the department’s pursuit statistics for the past two years, including 2017’s numbers: 2015 – 462 pursuits 2016 – 464 pursuits 2017 – 106 pursuits Those numbers were accumulated from a staff that includes 1,635 IMPD officers. However, the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department in North Carolina has a larger police department that includes 1,906 officers, and less pursuits. Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department pursuit numbers: 2015 – 34 pursuits 2016 – 48 pursuits 2017 – 9 pursuits 24-Hour News 8 has learned that the Charlotte Police Department has more restrictions on when officers can and can’t pursue a vehicle. Currently, IMPD is working with the Fraternal Order of Police (police union) to determine what policy may or may not be best for the city of Indianapolis. Despite the discussion, much of the framework for the new policy is in place, and Roach made it known he is anxious to get something done. “We are concerned about the number of pursuits here in Indianapolis and we are working to tighten that policy down, ” said Roach. We could learn more about IMPD’s pursuit policy in the coming months.

And as usual, the party has it wrong (“Legislators work to undo cities’ rules,” March 13). Rep. Pat Garofalo, R-Farmington, says that “the cultural values of Minneapolis are drastically out of alignment with greater Minnesota, so there’s going to be conflicts.” Well, actually it’s the other way around: The values of politicians like Garofalo are “out of alignment” with the views of the majority of the Twin Cities metro area, where 60 percent of Minnesotans live. One has to ask: What “values” is this politician citing? Are plastic bags, no sick leave and (God help us) permits for using bike lanes that critical to outstate voters? Do they really want state mandates that trump (so to speak) reasonable local ones? Are Garofalo’s values the same ones that are driving many young people to the Twin Cities? Perhaps if the Republicans really stood for the values that historically have defined Minnesota, they wouldn’t have to hyphenate their high schools and gerrymander their way into power. Doug Wilhide, Minneapolis • • • Perhaps Garofalo and like-thinking persons from the rest of the state will very much want to avoid the “conflicts” they will encounter when entering this cultural wasteland known as the Twin Cities. Let’s see — that would include games for the Twins, Wild, Vikings, Loons, Gophers and Timberwolves; performances at the Guthrie, Northrop, Walker, MIA, Ordway, Orchestra Hall and numerous other smaller venues, as well as visits to HCMC, Abbott Northwestern, the University of Minnesota Medical Center and the State Fair, just to name a few. As a decades-long resident of Minneapolis (just moved to Bloomington), I can only imagine how my cultural values are in need of re-imagining, especially at the behest of the likes of the good representative. Here’s the deal: We are all Minnesotans. We are in this deal together. We Twin Citians won’t denigrate the Eelpout Festival in Walker, the Fiesta Days in Montevideo, Defeat of Jesse James Days in Northfield (and on and on), and we’ll still go “Up North” and spend our millions, just so long as the rest of you let us do our thing here in the great cesspool of culture we choose to live in. Paul Linnee, Bloomington • • • When reading about pending legislation proposed by outstate Republican legislators, it appears the supposed divide between urban and rural is between special interests with economic objectives. How does a plastic bag ban in Minneapolis have deleterious effects on a shopper at Wal-Mart in Pine City? Do constituents of Rep. Duane Quam really think bikers in cities should have a permit to use bike lanes? Perhaps farmers should have permits to drive tractors down the road. I was outstate for 33 years, and not once did I feel as though Twin Cities ordinances had an effect on me. The real elephant in the room is ALEC (the American Legislative Exchange Council) and legislators who are members and adhere to that organization’s philosophy. Chuck Justice, Woodbury AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT The impact, the obligation, the media coverage, the history I was alarmed to read that Minnesota stands to lose as much as $80 million over the next five years under the proposed American Health Care Act (front page, March 13). Public health programs play an essential role creating the healthy Minnesota we all enjoy, and such a drastic cut in funding would hurt many Minnesotans. Just as physicians strive to improve the health of an individual patient, public health professionals work to improve the health of communities. From helping new mothers keep their babies healthy, to increasing access to cancer screening, to making sure the elderly maintain access to flu vaccines, public health programs create healthy communities for all of us. Not only does public health make our communities healthier, it also saves money. By investing in programs that keep Minnesotans healthy and prevent illnesses from progressing, public health programs reduce the burden on our health care system and reduce health care costs. If, instead of cutting public health funding, we invested just $10 per person per year in programs proven to increase physical activity, improve nutrition and prevent tobacco use, the U.S. could save more than $16 billion annually within five years. Cutting public health funding would make Minnesotans more sick and waste money. At a time when our nation is struggling to stay healthy and contain health care costs, it would be foolish to defund these critical prevention programs. Annie Krapek, Minneapolis The writer is a public health professional. • • • My handy pocket-size copy of the U.S. Constitution quite clearly states that promotion of the general welfare is inherent in our values. Maintaining a healthy population via prevention appears to be anathema to the Republican Party, at the expense of everyone else. Richard A. Pommier, Long Prairie, Minn. • • • The misleading media is shouting about 14 million people who may lose their health insurance under the proposed new AHCA. What the Congressional Budget Office report actually says is most of that number is voluntary: “CBO and JCT estimate that, in 2018, 14 million more people would be uninsured under the legislation than under current law. Most of that increase would stem from repealing the penalties associated with the individual mandate. Some of those people would choose not to have insurance because they chose to be covered by insurance under current law only to avoid paying the penalties, and some people would forgo insurance in response to higher premiums.” Bill Coleman, Plymouth • • • I’m on the White House mailing list and received an e-mail declaring that Obamacare was a “total failure” and inviting me to share my story of what happened to me under Obamacare. So I did. I told the White House that my daughter developed a serious health condition when she was 17, but that she was able to stay on our family’s health insurance because of Obamacare. I don’t know how we would have afforded her care otherwise. When she turned 26, she was able to get on other insurance regardless of her preexisting condition because Obamacare prevented insurance companies from rejecting people like her. Overall, Obamacare was a godsend for our family. I told the White House that I expected it wouldn’t use my story because I didn’t trash Obamacare and that seems to be all the White House and the Republicans want to hear. Although they don’t want to hear about the success stories, I hope others do, because good news about Obamacare isn’t fake news. My story and many others’ stories are real. Michael Jaes, Roseville SURDYK’S PENALTY City was shortsighted It is unfortunate that the city of Minneapolis acted so hastily to invoke an ill-conceived penalty on the Surdyk’s liquor store (“Nasty hangover for Surdyk’s,” March 14). The small, $2,000 cash penalty pales compared with the value of the publicity, fame and profits for that Sunday of sales. The loss of state and federal tax collections from the July liquor license suspension will be substantial on an average $2 million to $3 million in monthly sales. It would have been more tax-effective to the state to impose a penalty equal to the profits of that day of sales, or the profits from the month of July, which would preserve substantial tax collections. We expect more from our political leadership that only continues to let us down.

The Government Operations & Technology Appropriations Subcommittee voted 7-6 to support an amended proposal (HB 81) that would end a Depression-era law requiring liquor stores and bars to be separated from groceries and other retail goods, an issue commonly referred to as the "liquor wall." The contentious bill --- sought by Wal-Mart and Target and opposed by Publix and ABC Fine Wine & Spirits --- needs to make it through one more committee in the House and awaits a floor vote in the Senate (SB 106). House sponsor Bryan Avila, R-Hialeah, rejected claims by opponents that his legislation, three years in the making, will increase access to liquor by minors and harm existing businesses. "While shopping at Publix is a pleasure, certainly their argument is not," Avila said. "The only reason the antiquated law is being opposed is to maintain the status quo." Before the vote, Avila proposed an amendment that would sort alcohol licenses into two categories, one for businesses that seek to remain stand-alone for liquor, the other imposing fees --- based on county population --- for those that want to sell liquor in the same stores as other goods. Avila said he's also considering additional changes for when the proposal goes to the Commerce Committee. That could include requiring cashiers to be 18 or older when liquor is purchased and increasing penalties on businesses that are found selling to minors. He also indicated he is open to proposals in the Senate bill that would require small bottles, 6.8 ounces or less, to be displayed only behind the counter and phasing in the law over a four-year period. Still, the House bill, which appeared to stall a week ago, remains controversial for many. "The losers are clearly going to be the small businesses," said Rep. Kathleen Peters, a Treasure Island Republican who voted against the bill. Thomas Culligan, representing Publix, said in opposing the measure that the supermarket chain may be able to support a delayed implementation. Publix has opened stand-alone liquor stores in many shopping centers that also include grocery stores. "We've invested so much in the stores that we have built out in the state," Culligan said. "We also have a number of leases that we'd like to see expire if this does happen." Pat McClellan, owner of the Flora-Bama lounge and package store in the Panhandle, said the change would result in a greater ability for minors to get their hands on liquor and would lead to more impulse-buying of alcohol. "It ain't right to put the apple schnapps next to the apple sauce," McClellan said. Proponents contend abolishing the "outdated" law is necessary to provide more convenience to shoppers, reduce regulations and save money for businesses. Joseph Salzverg, a lobbyist for Target, said the change would allow the Minnesota-based company to meet customers' needs and expectations. "The way Target structures their business model is a racetrack type of shopping," Salzverg said. "That's why we don't currently operate bifurcated stores in the state of Florida."   false false false false false false false false false Popular false false false Recent Group wants cross taken from Longwood City Hall 'Just another case' says new proscutor Prosecutor Ayala was to be honored at banquet Law enforcement express dismay over prosecutor SpaceX sends satellite into orbit after delay Stories You May Be Interested In – includes Advertiser Stories false false false All content © Copyright 2000-2015 Fox Television Stations, Inc.

Evan Vucci/AP hide caption toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP White House Director of Strategic Initiatives Christopher Liddell (from left) with Dell CEO Michael Dell and General Dynamics CEO Phebe Novakovic during a meeting with President Trump on Feb. 23. Evan Vucci/AP Federal records indicate that a key adviser to President Trump held substantial investments in 18 companies when he joined Trump in meetings with their CEOs. The investments of Christopher Liddell, the president's director of strategic initiatives, totaled between $3 million and $4 million. Among the companies in Liddell's portfolio, and whose CEOs were in the meetings: Dell Technologies, Dow Chemical, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, Lockheed Martin and Wal-Mart. When Trump conferred with the chiefs of Ford, General Motors and Fiat-Chrysler last month, Liddell attended the session. He was invested in all three companies at the time. Politics Trump Ethics Monitor: Has The President Kept His Promises? Details of Liddell's investments are contained in documents he filed with the White House ethics officer in preparation for divesting his holdings. He was seeking certificates of divestiture, which allow federal appointees to defer paying capital-gains taxes by reinvesting in a blind trust or similar arrangement. The watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a complaint Tuesday with White House Counsel Donald McGahn, raising concerns that Liddell may have violated the federal conflict of interest law, a criminal statute. The complaint states: "If Mr. Liddell personally participated in meetings with companies in which he held significant amounts of stock, he may have violated these rules." The White House responded with this statement: "Mr. Liddell has been working with the Office of the White House Counsel to ensure he is fully compliant with his legal and ethical obligations in connection with his holdings and his duties in the White House." Liddell was born in New Zealand and is a U.S. citizen. In the past he has worked as chief financial officer of Ford Motors, International Paper and Microsoft. It's not clear whether Liddell now has sold off his investments, but he apparently had not done so before the meetings in question. The meetings were held on Jan. 23, Jan. 24 and Feb. 3. On Feb. 9, the Office of Government Ethics issued four certificates of divestiture for Liddell and his wife. They would be worthless if the assets had already been sold. The complaint is one of several actions by CREW on White House ethics issues. The group says in a lawsuit that Trump is violating the Constitution's ban on foreign emoluments (gifts); it has questioned the ethics of presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway after she urged TV viewers to buy Ivanka Trump's fashion merchandise; and it challenged the lack of transparency of two White House advisory committees. CREW Director Noah Bookbinder said of the White House, "It seems nobody is concerned about people making decisions based on their personal interests and not the interests of the American people."

By Dominic Gates, The Seattle Times SEATTLE — The trade group representing the nation’s largest aerospace and defense companies is throwing its full weight behind a sweeping Republican plan that would transform the U.S. tax system, lowering the corporate tax rate while imposing new taxes on imported goods. In a letter Tuesday to congressional leaders, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg, who is chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association, or AIA, this year, expressed the group’s strong support for measures it described as “comprehensive reforms of our tax code.” That puts all 330 companies in the aerospace lobbying group firmly on the side of what’s called the border adjustment tax, which they say will stimulate U.S. manufacturing jobs. The tax-system reform package is hugely controversial and opposed in particular by large retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target, which say it will cause steep price increases for consumers. Muilenburg — along with the CEOs of other major corporations including GE, Caterpillar, United Technologies, Raytheon, Oracle and Merck — had already last month joined the American Made Coalition that is lobbying for the change. AIA Chief Executive David Melcher described the current U.S. tax system as “broken” and not globally competitive. “We need a modern tax system which creates a level playing field with the rest of the world in order to locate and grow jobs, manufacturing and profits inside the United States,” Melcher said. The plan proposed by House Speaker Paul Ryan and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Kevin Brady, represents a structural shift from taxing bottom-line corporate profits to taxing companies through their cash flow. If the Ryan plan becomes law, every time an item is sold in the U.S., the sales revenue would be taxable at 20 percent, with deductions allowed for labor and inventory costs. Another boost to business is that capital investment — such as the billions of dollars Boeing invests in its assembly plants — would be immediately deductible in the year the money is spent, instead of being accounted for through depreciation over many years. The most controversial piece of the proposal is the “border adjustment” element, which would exempt U.S. exports from the tax entirely, while imports would be taxed at 20 percent. President Donald Trump was initially cool to the plan but recently seems to have come around to the idea. “I certainly support a form of tax on the border, because everybody else does,” Trump told Reuters last month. Bloomberg News reported that top Trump strategist Steve Bannon is an enthusiastic backer, citing a person familiar with discussions between Bannon and Ryan. A company like Boeing, a huge net exporter, is likely to come out well ahead. The impact on other companies will vary according to how much they import. How other countries might react to the tax on imports is uncertain. Proponents of the new system insist it won’t distort the trade balance. But some experts are skeptical and believe U.S. trading partners, including perhaps China, could impose retaliatory tariffs — potentially even triggering a destructive trade war. Nonetheless, the AIA leadership, in its letter, urges Congress “to act now.”   Most Read Standoff between woman, Everett police ends peacefully EVERETT — A nearly six-hour-long SWAT standoff ended peacefully Wednesday evening on… Mar 16th, 2017 by Herald Staff Intestinal illnesses linked to Marysville trampoline park MARYSVILLE — The Snohomish Health District is looking into reports of a… Mar 16th, 2017 by Kari Bray Cocoon House raises $8 million for new building EVERETT — Cocoon House, a nonprofit that serves homeless youth, is now… Mar 15th, 2017 by Chris Winters Tree house turned into bed and breakfast near Woodinville WOODINVILLE — Tree houses are growing up.

Should You Actually Try It? Fast Food Packaging: Are Chemicals Leaking into Your Food? Historic NYC Pub McSorley's Shut Down by Department of Health How to Stock a Healthy Pantry Drinking Lots of Water Prevents Kids from Eating Junk Food Genetics Could Be To Blame for Your Salt Cravings By Beth Kowitt Posted March 14, 2017 Packaged convenience foods are getting healthier, maybe. For years Big Food lured consumers to its processed and packaged products with an irresistible combination of sugar, fat, and salt. Now it seems at least some of those consumer packaged giants are reversing course. A new study released by the Consumer Goods Forum found that the 102 companies it surveyed ranging from Walmart to Nestle reformulated more than 180,000 of their products to “support healthier diets and lifestyles and address public health priorities.” That’s an increase from just 84,000 products in 2015 and 22,500 in 2014. The number one ingredient the companies—representing some $1.8 trillion in 2015 revenue—were looking to remove was sugar. Sodium came in second, followed by trans fats and saturated fats. Whole grains and vitamins were the top two elements companies added to recipes. Sugar has long been on its way to becoming public enemy No. 1. Research firm NPD Group has found that sugar is the main substance that consumers are now trying to eliminate from their diets. As David Turner, a global food and drink analyst at market research firm Mintel, recently told Fortune, “Sugar is the new tobacco” in the minds of the public. (For more, read “The Hunt for the Perfect Sugar.”) Despite the reduction that the survey indicates, sugar is still pervasive in packaged foods and beverages. Some 74% of them contain some form of the sweetener, according to a recent study in The Lancet. Robert Lustig, a professor at the University of California at San Francisco’s School of Medicine and a leading critical voice on the topic, explained that companies “use hedonic substances, and sugar is the most ubiquitous hedonic substance.” The problem for Big Food companies is that the alternatives they have long turned to—artificial sweeteners—are also becoming unpalatable to their customers. According to Mintel, 39% of consumers think it’s best to avoid products containing artificial ingredients like aspartame and saccharin because of perceptions of health risks. Sales of such substitutes fell 13% between 2011 and 2016. That’s led to rush to find the perfect substitute to sugar—one that’s natural, zero-calorie, and tastes just like the real stuff. Nestle, for example, is trying to change sugar’s structure by essentially hollowing it out. As I wrote last month: Stefan Catsicas, the company’s head of innovation, describes a sugar crystal as being like a box. We taste only the outside of it in our mouths, but we swallow the contents of the entire thing even though the sugar on the inside is not essential to the sense in our mouth. “We can structure it so whatever we put on the tongue will be perceived and will represent most of what we swallow,” Catsicas says. This could potentially cut down on sugar by up to 40%. The problem is that the structure is destroyed in water, which is present in most foods. Luckily for Nestlé, chocolate is one of the only foods that are not aqueous. Meanwhile, a cottage industry of startups has developed to try to solve the sugar problem, either by searching for the perfect natural substitute or messing with our taste receptors.

Evan Vucci/AP Federal records indicate that a key adviser to President Trump held substantial investments in 18 companies when he joined Trump in meetings with their CEOs. The investments of Christopher Liddell, the president's director of strategic initiatives, totaled between $3 million and $4 million. Among the companies in Liddell's portfolio, and whose CEOs were in the meetings: Dell Technologies, Dow Chemical, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, Lockheed Martin and Wal-Mart. When Trump conferred with the chiefs of Ford, General Motors and Fiat-Chrysler last month, Liddell attended the session. He was invested in all three companies at the time. Politics Trump Ethics Monitor: Has The President Kept His Promises? Details of Liddell's investments are contained in documents he filed with the White House ethics officer in preparation for divesting his holdings. He was seeking certificates of divestiture, which allow federal appointees to defer paying capital-gains taxes by reinvesting in a blind trust or similar arrangement. The watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a complaint Tuesday with White House Counsel Donald McGahn, raising concerns that Liddell may have violated the federal conflict of interest law, a criminal statute. The complaint states: "If Mr. Liddell personally participated in meetings with companies in which he held significant amounts of stock, he may have violated these rules." The White House responded with this statement: "Mr. Liddell has been working with the Office of the White House Counsel to ensure he is fully compliant with his legal and ethical obligations in connection with his holdings and his duties in the White House." Liddell was born in New Zealand and is a U.S. citizen. In the past he has worked as chief financial officer of Ford Motors, International Paper and Microsoft. It's not clear whether Liddell now has sold off his investments, but he apparently had not done so before the meetings in question. The meetings were held on Jan. 23, Jan. 24 and Feb. 3. On Feb. 9, the Office of Government Ethics issued four certificates of divestiture for Liddell and his wife. They would be worthless if the assets had already been sold. The complaint is one of several actions by CREW on White House ethics issues. The group says in a lawsuit that Trump is violating the Constitution's ban on foreign emoluments (gifts); it has questioned the ethics of presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway after she urged TV viewers to buy Ivanka Trump's fashion merchandise; and it challenged the lack of transparency of two White House advisory committees. CREW Director Noah Bookbinder said of the White House, "It seems nobody is concerned about people making decisions based on their personal interests and not the interests of the American people."

Vibrator users will receive $10,000 each after company tracked their sexual activity Which lightbulb should you buy? Think in lumens Warren Buffett is worth more than $70 billion, but he often doesn’t act like it — and neither do many other affluent Americans. The documentary “Becoming Warren Buffett” that aired recently on HBO shows Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, eating breakfast each day at McDonald’s. Each morning, he asks his wife to set out $2.61, $2.95 or $3.17, which determines which breakfast he gets. “When I’m not feeling quite so prosperous, I might go with the $2.61, which is two sausage patties, and then I put them together and pour myself a Coke,” he says in the film. He also still lives in the five-bedroom home he bought for just over $30,000 in 1958 in Omaha. He’s not the only rich person behaving like this: “Rich people don’t get rich by spending it all,” says Pam Danziger, a researcher focused on the affluent market and founder of Unity Marketing, which helps brands better connect with affluent consumers. “They know better than anyone that by being careful shoppers, they can achieve a lifestyle several rungs up the income ladder.” There are myriad reasons that many affluent people are, well, cheap. Some of them are self-made and have spent many years before they were rich being thrifty. “Thriftiness is habit-forming,” says Scott Tucker, president and founder of financial firm Scott Tucker Solutions in Chicago. Others fear that their wealth isn’t permanent, so they don’t spend a lot of their money. This is particularly true of the top 10 percent of the income spectrum, according to the 2015 Survey of Affluence and Wealth by research and polling firm YouGov. “The resourcefulness, financial independence and spending constraints that arose from the fear of the recession are now enduring attitudes of family financial management,” the study authors write. During the recession, like many Americans, “fear drove them to step up their savings, cut spending, and retool their household budgets, and to become more resourceful and independent when evaluating and making significant purchases. Over time, panic has given way to confidently applying these practices to their purchasing habits.” Of course, rich people spend a ton. In 2015 alone, the affluent upped their spending by 6.6 percent on luxury goods — largely driven by increased spending on travel, dining out, home entertainment and cars, YouGov found. Still, many of them are very thrifty. Here are five stats that prove this: They tool around town in a Ford Sure, there are plenty of loaded Americans driving BMWs, but many drive far more modest cars. Data released in August 2016 by car site Edmunds.com found that the most popular car among those with incomes above $250,000 a year was the Ford F-Series, followed by the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Jeep Wranger; the Lexus RX and BMW X5 were only Nos. 4 and 5 on the list. “There will always be an interest in and market for high-end exotic vehicles,” says Edmunds.com executive director of industry analysis Jessica Caldwell. “But, overall, most of the wealthiest Americans look for their vehicles to perform the same kind of functional tasks that everyone else does.” Other studies show a similar penchant for modest cars among the wealthy: Among the top 10 most popular vehicles in America’s wealthiest neighborhoods, half are non-luxury vehicles, an analysis of car-buying habits of residents of the 10 wealthiest zip codes in America by TrueCar.com found. These include the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Honda CR-V, Volkswagen Jetta and Toyota Prius. You’ll find them in the aisles of Wal-Mart … One in three people with a net worth of more than $5 million say they shop at Wal-Mart, according to a survey of 1,200 ultra-high-net-worth investors released in 2014 by financial information site Millionaire Corner. What’s more, nearly half say they shop at Costco, and more than four in 10 at Target. More On: savings Save six figures over your lifetime by making your own latte How to win the game and retire in your 30s Most Americans plan on saving their tax refund Saving for retirement isn't all it's cracked up to be … And dropping coin at the dollar store Many dollar store shoppers make $100,000 a year or more, data released by research firm NPD Group in July found. “Considering that nearly one in five dollars spent there is contributed by the affluent, dollar stores’ value proposition clearly resonates across economic segments,” says Andy Mantis, executive vice president of Checkout Tracking, a division of NPD. The average wealthy dollar store shopper makes about one trip a month to those stores, the data showed (though, to be fair, lower-income people do make more frequent trips). They clip a lot of coupons Millionaire actress Kristen Bell says she’s an avid couponer. Her favorite: the Bed Bath and Beyond coupon. And she’s not the only rich person to do so. People making over $100,000 were actually more likely than those making less to use coupons, a survey of more than 8,000 shoppers released in 2010 by deal site Deals.com found. What’s more, one in four people who often use six or more coupons during each shopping trip were affluent, reporting incomes of $75,000 or more, according to research released in 2011 by the University of Arizona’s John Davis Norton School of Family and Consumer Sciences. They’re known as “coupon divas” by the researchers. “They don’t use coupons because of financial constraints but because they perceive coupons as saving them money,” said Anita Bhappu, an associate professor at the University of Arizona. They give a lower percentage of their income to charity than do other groups “The rich aren’t the most generous,” concludes a study published in the Chronicle of Philanthropy. “Middle-class Amer­i­cans give a far bigger share of their discretionary income to charities than the rich.” The data, which looked at IRS records, found that while households earning $50,000 to $75,000 give an average of 7.6 percent of their discretionary income to charity, households making $100,000 or more give an average of 4.2 percent.

According to the Bartlesville Police, an elderly woman inside the store discovered that her purse was missing. She then reportedly confronted a young woman in the store who she suspected had taken her purse. The young woman ran outside and got into the passenger side of a red Pontiac Vibe. She was later identified as a 14 year old female. The case has been turned over to Office of Juvenile affairs and the District Attorneys Office. Because it was a misdemeanor offense she was not arrested for the purse snatching. However, Bartlesville Police Department Public Information Officer, Jay Hastings, says she was arrested on a non-related offense of Domestic Abuse which had taken place over the weekend. Hastings says there may  be other pending charges from other reports taken recently.   « Back to News KWON Cooking Extravaganza Advertising Opportunities Contest Rules About Us Make Us Your Home Page Employment Opportunities Terms of Use Privacy Contact Us 2017 © KCD Enterprises.

(March 14, 2017) Related Coverage Trump lays out tougher approach to illegal immigration Legal challenges to Trump’s travel ban mount from US states KALAMAZOO, Mich. (WOOD) — A Michigan organization is working to protect immigrants who fear deportation by housing them in churches. Michigan United has partnered with a dozen or so Calhoun and Kalamazoo County churches — some in secret — that have agreed to act as safe havens for people concerned they may be at risk of deportation. “We’re here today to say with a united voice that we stand with the immigrant and refugee families here in Kalamazoo,” Pastor Nathan Dannison said Tuesday at a press conference at First Congregational Church in downtown Kalamazoo. Organizers of the so-called “resistance” effort handed out a 2011 memo in which U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it would not perform planned operations or arrests at churches or other sensitive sites barring extraordinary circumstances. Leaders told stories of undocumented immigrants who are afraid to go outside, afraid their families will be torn apart because of President Donald Trump’s stricter stance on immigration. “They won’t even go to Wal-Mart. They’re just terrified to go to the store,” Milwood United Methodist Church Pastor Kim Clark said. But is the fear of ICE coming to people’s homes justified? “I have heard that it has happened in Michigan. I have not particularly heard that it has happened in Kalamazoo,” Michigan United volunteer Nelly Fuentes said. “ICE is in Kalamazoo regularly picking up people with warrants. I have not heard anything about massive raids.” And while Pastor Clark said he had heard anecdotes of ICE arrests, he said he didn’t know any families that had experienced one. Regardless, Fuentes said the Trump administration has increased “hatred against people who are brown.” “We just keep getting pounded and pounded with this administration,” she added. She said immigrants come to the U.S. fleeing terrible conditions. “People are leaving their homes because they absolutely have to. They must otherwise they will perish,” she said. “I am grateful that this (the sanctuary church effort) is here but it should not be needed.” Michigan United is a statewide group that advocates for immigration reform, among other things. It says it will help anyone from the West Michigan area and hopes to get some grand Rapids-area churches on board. It is also organizing similar efforts in other cities, including Detroit. Those looking to benefit from the sanctuary churches can contact Michigan United online.

Separately the DJIA closed down 0.20% on the day at 20,840.25, down approximately 41.23 points. The overall drop in the markets was brought about by oil and gas stocks, as crude oil continues to drop further below the $50 mark. We also saw industrial goods drop off and major airlines continued to fall from Monday. Not too much was positive in the market industry-wise besides textiles but a few big winners on the day were Wal-Mart and Nike. Crude oil continued its journey down, closing 1.1% lower at $47.86. Gold fell slightly below the $1,200 level. On the day it fell 0.4% or $5.20, closing at $1,197.90. As we have said before, the oil and gas companies helped pull the S&P down along with industrial goods and major airlines. It would appear that the price of crude dropping would be a common denominator across these industries. Textiles was the only industry that was positive across the board. Nike, with its apparel business, spearheaded the industry after recent analyst reports were very bullish on the stock and industry as a whole. The S&P 500 stock posting the largest daily percentage loss ahead of the close Tuesday was United Continental Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: UAL) which traded down 4.7% at $66.59. The stock’s 52-week range is $37.41 to $76.80. Volume was 7.2 million versus the daily average of 3.3 million shares. The stock posting the largest daily percentage gain in the S&P 500 ahead of the close Tuesday was The Western Union Co. (NYSE: WU) which jumped 3.6% to $20.28.

Want uninterrupted access to TheMercury.com on your computer, smartphone and tablet? We have many subscription options to fit your needs. See my options Riley County police are investigating the use of so-called “skimmers” at two area gas stations. RCPD spokesman Alexander Robinson said the devices, which read the magnetic strip on a debit or credit card when customers insert their card to pay for gas at a pump, were found last week at two Shop Quik locations — 529 Richards Drive and 430 Fort Riley Blvd. The thief responsible is apparently using the stolen card information, rather than selling it in bulk. “It seems like they are using it and paying for stuff online at Walmart, which is generally not what you would see if they were sold in bulk,” Robinson said. Because the devices are installed inside the pump, there is no way for customers to know a skimmer is present. Getting inside of the pump requires the criminal to have a key, pick the lock, force it open, or take advantage of a pump left unlocked. “We won’t be able to find out for sure until we catch the people and have a chat with them,” Robinson said. Robinson said gas pumps are the only target. “Anything where you are using a debit or credit card is susceptible to skimming or some type of electronic hacking where they can get your information,” he said. RCPD doesn’t know how many cards were potentially affected. “We don’t know how long they were there for,” he said. “They could have been installed that morning and were found four hours later or they could have been there a while.” Robinson recommends people regularly check their financial statements and make sure there is no fraudulent activity. If a person suspects fraudulent activity, Robinson said to call Riley County dispatch at 785-537-2112 to report it.

(Karrierebibel.de) A heavily lobbied measure intended to knock down a decades-old prohibition on selling liquor in grocery and large retail stores narrowly continued to advance in the House on Tuesday. The Government Operations & Technology Appropriations Subcommittee voted 7-6 to support an amended proposal (HB 81) that would end a Depression-era law requiring liquor stores and bars to be separated from groceries and other retail goods, an issue commonly referred to as the “liquor wall.” The contentious bill — sought by Wal-Mart and Target and opposed by Publix and ABC Fine Wine & Spirits — needs to make it through one more committee in the House and awaits a floor vote in the Senate (SB 106). House sponsor Bryan Avila, R-Hialeah, rejected claims by opponents that his legislation, three years in the making, will increase access to liquor by minors and harm existing businesses. “While shopping at Publix is a pleasure, certainly their argument is not,” Avila said. “The only reason the antiquated law is being opposed is to maintain the status quo.” Before the vote, Avila proposed an amendment that would sort alcohol licenses into two categories, one for businesses that seek to remain stand-alone for liquor, the other imposing fees — based on county population — for those that want to sell liquor in the same stores as other goods. Avila said he’s also considering additional changes for when the proposal goes to the Commerce Committee. That could include requiring cashiers to be 18 or older when liquor is purchased and increasing penalties on businesses that are found selling to minors. He also indicated he is open to proposals in the Senate bill that would require small bottles, 6.8 ounces or less, to be displayed only behind the counter and phasing in the law over a four-year period. Still, the House bill, which appeared to stall a week ago, remains controversial for many. “The losers are clearly going to be the small businesses,” said Rep. Kathleen Peters, a Treasure Island Republican who voted against the bill. Thomas Culligan, representing Publix, said in opposing the measure that the supermarket chain may be able to support a delayed implementation. Publix has opened stand-alone liquor stores in many shopping centers that also include grocery stores. “We’ve invested so much in the stores that we have built out in the state,” Culligan said. “We also have a number of leases that we’d like to see expire if this does happen.” Pat McClellan, owner of the Flora-Bama lounge and package store in the Panhandle, said the change would result in a greater ability for minors to get their hands on liquor and would lead to more impulse-buying of alcohol. “It ain’t right to put the apple schnapps next to the apple sauce,” McClellan said. Proponents contend abolishing the “outdated” law is necessary to provide more convenience to shoppers, reduce regulations and save money for businesses. Joseph Salzverg, a lobbyist for Target, said the change would allow the Minnesota-based company to meet customers’ needs and expectations. “The way Target structures their business model is a racetrack type of shopping,” Salzverg said. “That’s why we don’t currently operate bifurcated stores in the state of Florida.” –Jim Turner, News Service of Florida Recommend or share: Tweet Print More Email Share on Tumblr Questions?

Isn’t it hard enough for kids looking for work without the damage this will do because of age requirements? No doubt, a backroom with pallets of hooch will be of no interest to young stock clerks and others. Right Bryan? Reply Fred says: March 14, 2017 at 7:36 pm Just what America needs…More DRUNKS !!!!

Reply Larry Krasner says: March 15, 2017 at 8:56 am What I dislike about this proposed change is it will mean a significant loss in shoppers’ choices. They’re going to take out an aisle or two of groceries and replace them with booze. It will also drive up prices a bit because that’s what happens when they reduce buyer choices.

The group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, filed a complaint with the White House on Tuesday. CREW says Christopher Liddell, President Trump's director of strategic initiatives and a former top executive for General Motors, Microsoft, International Paper and William Morris Endeavor, may have broken a conflict-of-interest law. In the early weeks of the administration, Liddell attended meetings with Trump and executives from more than a dozen companies, the complaint says. At that time, Liddell appears to have held millions of dollars' worth of stock in many of those same companies, including GM, International Paper, Tesla Motors, Lockheed Martin, JPMorgan Chase, Pepsi and Walmart, the complaint says. CREW says it based its conclusion on what are known as certificates of divestiture, indicating that Liddell owned stock in hundreds of companies, including those whose executives were in the White House meetings. Those certificates would have allowed him to sell stock holdings identified as ethically problematic without having to pay steep capital gains taxes. Liddell would get the benefit so long as he reinvested his money in an investment allowed by the government, like a highly diversified mutual fund. The certificates were not issued until Feb. 9, six days after the last of the meetings. That "strongly indicates Mr. Liddell still held stock in the companies at that point and had not divested his financial interests in these assets prior to his participation in the meetings," CREW says. The ethics office did not immediately respond to a request from CNNMoney for the documents. A White House spokesperson said Liddell "has been working with the Office of the White House Counsel to ensure he is fully compliant with his legal and ethical obligations in connection with his holdings and his duties in the White House." The spokesperson did not address whether Liddell owned those specific stocks at the time he sat in the meetings, as the CREW complaint alleges. Federal code prohibits federal employees from participating personally in a particular matter in which, to their knowledge, they have a "financial interest." CREW wants the White House to confirm whether Liddell held stock in the companies, whether he sold the stocks or got a waiver before the meetings, and whether the Justice Department should investigate. CREW notes that it's not publicly known what was discussed at the meetings. But Trump has publicly indicated that he discussed policy matters and other regulations. "Will be meeting at 9:00 with top automobile executives concerning jobs in America," he tweeted about the Jan. 24 meeting with General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler.

The powerful nor'easter fell well short of forecasters' snow predictions in New York and Philadelphia but unloaded 1-2ft in places mostly inland, grounded more than 6,000 flights, and knocked out power to nearly a quarter of a million customers from Virginia northward. By the time it reached Massachusetts, it had turned into a blizzard, with near hurricane-force wind gusting over 70mph along the coast and waves crashing over the seawalls. Up to a foot of snow was expected in the Boston area. It was easily the biggest storm in a winter that had mostly spared the north-east. "It's horrible," said Don Zimmerman, of Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, using a snowblower to clear the pavement. "I thought winter was out of here. ... It's a real kick in the rear." While people mostly heeded dire warnings to stay home and off the roads, police said a 16-year-old girl was killed when she lost control of her car on a snowy road and hit a tree in Gilford, New Hampshire. The storm closed schools in cities big and small, Amtrak suspended services and the post office halted deliveries. Philadelphia and New York City escaped the brunt of the snow, getting just a few inches and not the foot or more forecasters had expected before the storm switched over mostly to sleet. In New Jersey, which saw rain or just a little snow in many areas, Governor Chris Christie called the storm an "underperformer". Inland areas, meanwhile, got hit hard. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Worcester, Massachusetts, received a foot or more of snow. The Binghamton, New York, area was hit with over 2ft, while Vernon, New Jersey, got at least 19 inches. The storm came just days after the region saw temperatures climb into the 60s, and less than a week before the official start of spring. February, too, was remarkably warm. In the nation's capital, non-essential federal employees were given the option of reporting three hours late, taking the day off or working from home. The city got less than 2 inches of snow. As the storm closed in, the National Weather Service used terms like "life-threatening" and urged people to "shelter in place," language that has come to be associated with mass shootings. In the end, the line between snow and rain shifted slightly to the west, sparing some of the Northeast's big cities. Government meteorologists realised by late Monday afternoon that there was a good chance the storm was not going to produce the giant big-city snow totals predicted. But they did not change their forecast for fear people would mistakenly think the storm was no longer dangerous, said Greg Carbin, chief of forecast operations at the Weather Prediction Centre.

None of the above home : local news : local news March 16, 2017 3/14/2017 3:46:00 PM Man charged for filching pills at Walmart PETE WILSON Editor A Jackson area man faces two charges after he allegedly stole prescription pills from an unattended cart at the Jackson Walmart store last Saturday afternoon, March 11. Jackson Police report that Matthew A. Floyd, 36, of Jisco West Road, Jackson, faces charges of Theft Of Drugs and Possession Of Drugs as a result of the incident. Police say the store's video surveillance system was instrumental in leading to his identification and arrest, which occurred just two hours after the theft. Police were notified at 12:30 p.m. Saturday that Thomas Pratt of Chillicothe Street, Jackson, had reported the theft of prescription drugs which he had just purchased at the Walmart pharmacy. Pratt had left a bag containing his newly purchased prescription medication in a motorized cart in the store's breezeway, then departed from the store. When Pratt realized he had left behind his medicine and went back to the cart, he found the bag was no longer there. When he went to the pharmacy department to see if the bag had turned in, he was relieved to see it had been turned in, but he then discovered that one of the bottles of pills was missing from the bag. Police and store personnel immediately checked surveillance videotape, which showed a male taking the bag from the unattended motorized cart, then going to his parked vehicle in the parking lot. He then returned to the store with the bag and turned it into the pharmacy department, allegedly minus one bottle of pills. Police, however, were able to make a tentative identification from the surveillance videotape and the search was on for Floyd. At 2:38 p.m. that same afternoon, officers on patrol were able to locate Floyd driving his vehicle on East Street in Jackson and conducted a traffic stop. After a canine alerted on the vehicle, a search was conducted and officers found a bottle of prescription pills with Thomas Pratt's name on it. The prescription was for 90 pills, but there was only 25 pills remaining in the bottle.

The group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, filed a complaint with the White House on Tuesday. CREW says Christopher Liddell, President Trump’s director of strategic initiatives and a former top executive for General Motors, Microsoft, International Paper and William Morris Endeavor, may have broken a conflict-of-interest law. In the early weeks of the administration, Liddell attended meetings with Trump and executives from more than a dozen companies, the complaint says. At that time, Liddell appears to have held millions of dollars’ worth of stock in many of those same companies, including GM, International Paper, Tesla Motors, Lockheed Martin, JPMorgan Chase, Pepsi and Walmart, the complaint says. CREW says it based its conclusion on what are known as certificates of divestiture, indicating that Liddell owned stock in hundreds of companies, including those whose executives were in the White House meetings. Those certificates would have allowed him to sell stock holdings identified as ethically problematic without having to pay steep capital gains taxes. Liddell would get the benefit so long as he reinvested his money in an investment allowed by the government, like a highly diversified mutual fund. The certificates were not issued until Feb. 9, six days after the last of the meetings. That “strongly indicates Mr. Liddell still held stock in the companies at that point and had not divested his financial interests in these assets prior to his participation in the meetings,” CREW says. The ethics office did not immediately respond to a request from CNNMoney for the documents. A White House spokesperson said Liddell “has been working with the Office of the White House Counsel to ensure he is fully compliant with his legal and ethical obligations in connection with his holdings and his duties in the White House.” The spokesperson did not address whether Liddell owned those specific stocks at the time he sat in the meetings, as the CREW complaint alleges. Federal code prohibits federal employees from participating personally in a particular matter in which, to their knowledge, they have a “financial interest.” CREW wants the White House to confirm whether Liddell held stock in the companies, whether he sold the stocks or got a waiver before the meetings, and whether the Justice Department should investigate. CREW notes that it’s not publicly known what was discussed at the meetings. But Trump has publicly indicated that he discussed policy matters and other regulations. “Will be meeting at 9:00 with top automobile executives concerning jobs in America,” he tweeted about the Jan. 24 meeting with General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler. “I want new plants to be built here for cars sold here!” Trump to announce do-over on fuel economy rules for automakers Neiman Marcus is up for sale Related Posts Here’s why Uber may pay more than $3 billion for Nokia’s maps McDonald’s tests putting mac and cheese on its menu America’s most hated retailer is… DEP Reorganizes “To Improve Efficiency, Transparency” Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Another traumatic effect of war, moral injury, is receiving more attention. David Wood is the senior military correspondent for The Huffington Post and a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who has covered conflict for more than 35 years throughout the Middle East, Africa, Russia and China. A self-described pacifist Quaker, Wood takes a humanistic approach to his work about war. His latest book "What Have We Done" explores this infrequently addressed burden our soldiers are bringing back from war. How can the average American understand the difference between PTSD and moral injury? If you have severe moral injury or PTSD, both of those can make you feel anxious, can make you lose sleep, can make you susceptible to eruptions of anger, irritability, that sort of thing. Mostly anxiety I think. But the causes are different. PTSD the way I understand it is a purely physical thing that happens when you’re faced with a life-threatening situation or big threat. Your body involuntarily reacts to that. It’s automatic, it kicks off and it helps you get through a crisis. The problem is when something kicks that off and you’re not in danger. So you’re at Walmart and something kicks off your fight-or-flight response and all of a sudden you’re sweating heavily, there’s adrenaline squirting into your bloodstream, you’ve got all this excess energy and it can be really profoundly disturbing to have that happen. Moral injury is a completely different thing where your sense of what’s right is violated, either by something that happens external to you, or something that you did or failed to do, or something that you saw. We all walk around with a pretty well developed sense of what’s right. It comes from what you learned growing up and it comes from military values on top of that. The big one is you’re responsible for your buddy no matter what ... Even if the sniper came out of nowhere, you can feel guilty at the time for not being able to protect your buddy. So that’s not right, that’s a hard thing to deal with. Those things can be difficult to absorb and reconcile with. You’ve done a lot of work exploring moral injury. When did you first learn of the concept and what struck you about it? In retrospect, thinking back I sort of noticed there were things that were happening during deployments that people felt bad about in some way. It wasn’t until I went back and started to re-interview people that I’d known when I was deployed and started seeking out other people, that I really started to zero in on this whole idea of moral injury. Because it’s kind of hard to see, and it’s not the kind of thing that people necessarily want to talk about. What recent executive orders mean for Texas’ military community Do you feel moral injury was more difficult for soldiers to discuss than PTSD? Some people are okay talking about anything and some people are more private, so I don’t think I can generalize there. One thing I noticed early on was that this was not PTSD. I’d done a big project on the physically wounded of Iraq and Afghanistan, and then that sort of got me interested in mental wounds. So I did a lot of stories on traumatic brain injury, and so after I got that done I said, well I still don’t understand this because it seems to me that most of the people I know don’t have PTSD, it’s something different. The work of Jonathan Shay, a VA psychiatrist who worked in Boston for decades with Vietnam veterans, sort of coined the phrase moral injury and really he is a father of modern understanding of moral injury. I’d known him for a long time and I’d read his books, but I went back to reread them and I thought “A-ha! This is what we’re talking about.” Soldiers with 2nd Platoon, A Company 1-30 Infantry, 1st Brigade Combat Team 3rd Infantry Division of the U.S. Army, from Fort Benning, Georgia, are the first to set foot in Iraq as they search an Iraqi borderpost that was hit with artillery just hours before, as U.S. ground forces moved across the border from Kuwait, Thursday evening March 20, 2003.  KRT; DAVID P. GILKEY/DETROIT FREE PRESS  Do you feel like you experienced moral injury during your time in war zones? How do you connect to it? Thinking back on my experiences ... I think that I’ve experienced a tiny bit of moral injury. It’s important and only interesting because it allowed me to gain understanding of the severe moral injury that other people can go through. I don’t put my experience up against people who’ve deployed as combatants. But I’ve had a couple experiences that were just enough to make me think, Oh yeah, something happened to me that I didn’t feel too good about when it was over. I think all of us have had moments where ... we later thought I’m not terribly proud of that. And that’s a small moral injury. There’s a tremendous realm of severity. A lot of moral injury that’s experienced in wartime is transitory and certainly not disabling. What is being done right now to help troops with moral injury, and is it enough? There are people in the department of Veterans Affairs who recognized moral injury way before me and set about trying to deal with it. My sense is that there are plenty of people with moral injury who feel perfectly well-adjusted and that they don’t need help, and that’s fine. I certainly don’t think that everyone who’s experienced moral injury has to take therapy or pills or anything of that sort. But there are some people that feel so morally injured that it drives them to their knees. It’s disabling. Why can't Americans muster much empathy for Muslim victims of terrorism? It can be difficult for a combat veteran to talk openly about what happened because of what people might think. So I think for people who are bothered by their moral injury, being in an environment where you can talk about what happened, about what’s bothering you and have people accept that ... there can be a sense of acceptance in that for the veteran. Ancient societies and even some cultures today have formal ceremonies of cleansing and forgiveness for their returning warriors. There are Native American groups where the women would paint warriors when they went off to battle. And then when they came back there would be a ceremonial washing off of the warpaint as a way of acknowledging that they may have done some things that are hard, but they’re still loved and welcome at home. We don’t have anything like that in our culture. It’s now been 14 years since the Iraq invasion, how would you like for civilians to look at an anniversary like this one? Try to envision the enormous human capital that’s gone into fighting that war and others. The enormous sacrifice that those people made and are still making in ways that are very difficult to see like moral injury. There’s a lot civilians can do. One of the reasons I wrote this book was to encourage civilians who know nothing about the military and have no connection to it to recognize that there is a burden that falls on the men and women we send to war, and they carry that around with them. So if there are ways that people can find to meet veterans and say: “I didn’t go, I chose not go, so I can never really understand what it was like, but I’d to try to understand a little bit and if you can try to talk about it I’d like to listen.” And then listen with validation, which just means accepting what the person is telling you and not trying to dismiss it. Just acknowledging, “Yeah that sounds kind of painful.” Reports indicate President Donald Trump may deploy more troops in the Middle East in the future. Is that a positive move in a war that’s been going on this long? We’ve got active wars going on in Syria, Yemen, in Iraq and Afghanistan among many other places, but those are big hot ones. I think we know deep down that you don’t win those wars by dropping explosives on people. You gotta have people go in and hold ground. So I thought for a long time it’s inevitable, we’re gonna start sending American ground forces into Syria -- which we’ve done -- send them back into Afghanistan -- which we’ve done -- send them back into Iraq -- which we’ve done. So I’m not surprised by this kind of thing, but I’m always a little bit bothered by how easily that happens. How almost invisible and painless it is. So we’re sending more marines back into Afghanistan... a lot of marines got killed there. It’s a dangerous place. And it happened without any discussion or without much notice. I’m sorry, this is a huge deal. People volunteered to put their lives on the line for their country and it hardly even causes a ripple. It does bother me that these decisions are made basically without any of us in the civilian world being aware of it. I think we’ve gotten so blasé about sending people off to war that we hardly even think about it. And I think that gives political leaders the leeway to do it. Could that effect intensify if we continue these wars? Yes, unless people make a fuss and say maybe we agree that we send Marines, but you need to come to us to ask, at least go to Congress. They’re the ones that have the war-making power under the Constitution. The public’s not paying attention, and we all sort of shrug when we send more people off to war. How would you feel if you went off to war and nobody noticed? There’s another moral injury right there before they even get off the plane in Kabul or wherever they’re flying to.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars GAMES Nintendo Switch’s traffic data proves new consoles are the lifeblood of retail Jeff Grubb@jeffgrubb March 14, 2017 1:10 PM Tags: console gaming, nintendo, Nintendo Switch, Switch Above: Nintendo Switch launch at the Nintendo Store in New York City. Image Credit: Nintendo We are coming off a major console launch, and an event like that can significantly affect the business of selling games. And retailers that are prepared for it can take advantage of that to boost its web traffic and its sales, and that’s exactly what happened with the Nintendo Switch. Every major retailer in the United States saw an increase in their web and mobile traffic from Nintendo’s site and from searches for the Switch, according to analytics firm SimilarWeb. GameStop and Toys ‘R’ Us traffic peaked over a 30-day period on the Nintendo Switch’s March 3 launch day. Nintendo.com also sent a surge of clicks to GameStop, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — but Amazon and Toys ‘R’ Us saw the biggest increases compared to January 2017. Most of this data isn’t surprising, but it does highlight the importance of a console launch to both the online and brick-and-mortar retail space. Over the month leading into the launch of the Switch, Nintendo’s website sent 1.4 million clicks through to Amazon. That outpaced every other retailer. Toys R Us received the lead amount of hits from Nintendo.com, but it also had the largest spike in traffic from the publisher’s website with an increase of 813 percent compared to January. Above: Nintendo Switch launch data. Image Credit: Nintendo When it came to search, GameStop showed its market dominance. It owned more than 3 percent of the clicks for the term “Switch” in the month leading up to the launch of the system. But Target, Best Buy, Toys R Us, and Walmart also all saw an increase in traffic during that period after barely getting a quarter of the traffic from that term in January. Above: Target and other retailers benefitted greatly from the excitement as March 3 approached. Image Credit: SimilarWeb Finally, traffic patterns to Nintendo’s website reveal when gaming fans are more likely to take action. Above: Traffic patterns for Nintendo.com. Image Credit: SimilarWeb March 3 was a big day for hits to Nintendo.com, but it was well behind the deluge of clicks that happened on January 13 when the company revealed the Switch during a live video presentation. And no day over the last year led to more traffic for Nintendo.com than the launch of the Miitomo smartphone app on March 31, 2016. That game debuted alongside the new My Nintendo account, which required fans to get on the company’s website to sign up. Miitomo and My Nintendo account signups led to 1.7 million visitors whereas the Switch launch day had just around 1 million.

So if this week’s edition ends up not sitting well with you, please send the hate mail, the bomb, etc. their way. Thanks for understanding. And thanks for all the fish … I am not what you call fluent in fashion. My style is that I don’t really have any style. However, I am observant, and I’ve noticed that true nerds have a consistent dress code. While there is a range in … “upscaleness” (is that even a word?) in attire from nerd to nerd, there are a few common, basic building blocks. Take shirts, for example. Shirts are an essential weapon in the nerd wardrobe arsenal. A shirt doesn’t just give a nerd some style — it can even signal to other nerds that the wearer is part of the club. This is especially true shirts that are less common and mass-produced than the ones you can get for $7.50 at Walmart. And all the while, the right shirt really reflects the feelings the wearer has for favorite fandoms. Yes, the right shirt is truly a Swiss Army knife-like fusion of function, feeling and fashion. And I believe there are five basic types of shirt that all well-dressed nerds should have in their closet … The graphic tee This is the nerd’s fashion bread and butter. Emblazoned with logos and depiction of your favorite pop culture characters or properties, the graphic tee can be in instant identifier to like-minded people that you know what’s up. For example, let’s say I wear my Babymetal tee out to Best Buy or the zoo or someplace like that. Ninety percent of people will have no idea what Babymetal is and no desire to learn. But the people that know will give me a thumbs up or a knowing nod. They may approach me and have an instant opening line: “Nice shirt, homie.” And if I see a beautiful woman who’s also wearing Babymetal gear? Well, I would be too scared to approach her, but I DEFINITELY would spend a lot of time beating myself up for not talking to a gorgeous female who may actually share a common interest with me. Sometimes you have to take what life gives you. The long-sleeved button-down Hard to believe, but there may come a day where you may not feel like wearing Green Lantern or Chewbacca on your chest. Or maybe you may need to look more presentable. Or perhaps you may just want to wear something with a little more to offer in the sleeves department. That’s why having at least two or three long-sleeved button-downs in your closet. Solid colors and plaid flannels are my personal favorites, but there are plenty of other options. The floral print Hawaiian shirt Because if they’re good enough for Wash of “Firefly,” they’re good enough for any nerd. The sports jersey with nerdy stuff on it The battle between jocks and nerds still rages today, and most of the time, jocks have most of the ammunition. But you can strike at a jock’s heart by wearing a football or baseball jersey defaced and desecrated with nerdy logos and images. Wear your Team Gryffindor hockey jersey to your jock brother-in-law’s house and watch the pain well up in his face. Or maybe just wear them because they look cool. The sweater Sweaters, cardigans and sweater vests are essential nerd attire. Not only do they keep skinny nerds warm at social gatherings held in drafty rooms, they also don’t stand out or draw too much attention, allowing you to blend into the background of a party or family gathering. Unless, of course, we’re talking ugly sweaters. Then all bets are off. I prefer my sweaters of the hooded sweatshirt variety. They’re super comfy, and since most of them are splattered with “Star Wars” graphics or Marvel Comics characters, they serve some of the same purposes that my graphic tees. If I REALLY want to show my “Star Wars” love, I can wear my Boba Fett hoodie over my “Return of the Jedi” T-shirt. Hey, this was kind of fun. Maybe I should do headgear next … NEVER MISS A STORY!

I’m writing to inform you that we do, and to educate our residents on the truths about homelessness. We believe in Auburn and love it, so we have to believe in our ability to serve ANY one in Auburn. Have you ever heard the term “a team is only as good as it’s weakest member”? That one family that sleeps in their car in the Wal-Mart parking lot every night represents our city just as much as the President of our University does. Do you know where individuals whom are homeless in our area sleep? They sleep in abandoned buildings, cars in parking lots, in and out of cheap, unsanitary hotels and under bridges. Have you seen them in these locations?  If so, this would be a good time to mention that. I have met people coming through local help resources that tell me they sleep in their cars at night. Let’s get some facts straight about why people become homeless. No, it’s not just individuals who do not want to work. Homeless individuals are people such as youth who age out of the foster care system, single mothers or fathers who lost a spouse that are now living off of one income, elderly who barely receive enough per month to live, or even individuals with a disability. You may be thinking, “what about all that government assistance” and “why can’t they just get a job and use their money the way they are supposed to” (both questions I hear frequently). The truth lies in these statistics: according to livingwage.mit.edu, the wage needed to live, not be comfortable, is $10.17 per/hour for one adult. Minimum wage in Alabama is still $7.25 per/hour. So no, you cannot expect that the mother, father, older adult, young adult or teen taking your order at a fast food restaurant is making even close to enough to find a bed that night. Our system in Alabama is designed to keep individuals whom are homeless where they are. By the way, two highly talked about government assistance funds: food stamps and TANF are also not enough to feed and help families in need. TANF is Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. According to The Kaiser Family Foundation, the average monthly assistance through food stamps (SNAP) in Alabama is only about $125.73 per person. I am what is considered a poor college student and that is barely enough to help me through the month. I want to also be clear that programs such as TANF have strict requirements. TANF is time limited – only allowed for 48 months. According to TANF.us, you must work or take part in work activity for 30 hours per week. That means recipients MUST attend school, work or look for jobs actively for 30 hours per week. This is not free money. To wrap this up, I suggest a solution to help homeless individuals in the Auburn/Opelika area. The city governments have both denied the production of a homeless shelter in our local cities. I want to advocate for city funding to be used to build and maintain a homeless shelter in the Auburn/Opelika area. Let us provide care for people in need of our love, rather than ignore the problems they face. Julie Spear is a concerned Auburn citizen who has a passion to bring awareness of the reality of homelessness in the area.

In a letter Tuesday to congressional leaders, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg, who is chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association, or AIA, this year, expressed the group’s strong support for measures it described as “comprehensive reforms of our tax code.” That puts all 330 companies in the aerospace lobbying group firmly on the side of what’s called the border adjustment tax, which they say will stimulate U.S. manufacturing jobs. The tax-system reform package is hugely controversial and opposed in particular by large retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target, which say it will cause steep price increases for consumers. Advertisement Continue reading Muilenburg — along with the CEOs of other major corporations including GE, Caterpillar, United Technologies, Raytheon, Oracle and Merck — had already last month joined the American Made Coalition that is lobbying for the change. In a separate statement, AIA Chief Executive David Melcher described the current U.S. tax system as “broken” and not globally competitive. “We need a modern tax system which creates a level playing field with the rest of the world in order to locate and grow jobs, manufacturing and profits inside the United States,” Melcher said. The plan proposed by House Speaker Paul Ryan and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Kevin Brady, represents a structural shift from taxing bottom-line corporate profits to taxing companies through their cash flow. If the Ryan plan becomes law, every time an item is sold in the U.S., the sales revenue would be taxable at 20 percent, with deductions allowed for labor and inventory costs. Another boost to business is that capital investment — such as the billions of dollars Boeing invests in its assembly plants — would be immediately deductible in the year the money is spent, instead of being accounted for through depreciation over many years. The most controversial piece of the proposal is the “border adjustment” element, which would exempt U.S. exports from the tax entirely, while imports would be taxed at 20 percent. President Donald Trump was initially cool to the plan but recently seems to have come around to the idea. Advertisement Continue reading “I certainly support a form of tax on the border, because everybody else does,” Trump told Reuters last month. Bloomberg News reported that top Trump strategist Steve Bannon is an enthusiastic backer, citing a person familiar with discussions between Bannon and Ryan. A company like Boeing, a huge net exporter, is likely to come out well ahead. The impact on other companies will vary according to how much they import. How other countries might react to the tax on imports is uncertain. Proponents of the new system insist it won’t distort the trade balance. But some experts are skeptical and believe U.S. trading partners, including perhaps China, could impose retaliatory tariffs — potentially even triggering a destructive trade war. Nonetheless, the AIA leadership, in its letter, urges Congress “to act now.” —— ©2017 The Seattle Times Visit The Seattle Times at www.seattletimes.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. _____ Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe Most Recent Biz News Suggested Stories: States grovel before Boeing in bid for 777X jobs – Dec 5, 2013 Washington state pitches more help for Boeing – Jan 15, 2014 Military fuel tanker delays pull down Boeing's 2Q earnings – Jul 22, 2015 Boeing chief pledges to work with new administration after Trump threatened to kill Air Force One deal – Dec 7, 2016 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

Terrill Chatman, 48, pleaded guilty to one count of misappropriation of postal funds in November 2016. Chief U.S. District Judge Karon O. Bowdre sentenced Chatman to 12 months of probation. He was ordered to complete a financial literacy program during his probation, and barred from obtaining any new debts. According to court documents, Chatman was a postal worker when he stole two gift cards from the mail in 2015. The gift cards included a $50 Publix gift card and a $10 Walmart gift card from mailboxes at the Crowne at Grandview apartment complex, which was on his postal route. When police questioned Chatman about the missing gift cards, he denied taking them but told officers that he was experiencing financial trouble, documents showed. Chatman said he was divorced and had children to support, which made him financially strained. Records show he said, "Yes, I'm having financial problems." Police said when Chatman was arrested, he had several gift cards in his possession and numerous others in his vehicle. Chatman, of Birmingham, was an offensive lineman on the 1989 Alabama football team that finished with a 10-2 record and a share of the SEC Championship. He was one of nine Alabama players who received All-SEC honors that year. Must-see concerts in Alabama this year ...

Hot Topics: Box of ducklings Lafayette suicide Boulder trail graffiti Boulder Junction settlement Leanin' Tree Museum closing News tips Print   Email   Font Resize Boulder County judge to allow stalker Robert Vinyard to take supervised trips By Mitchell Byars Staff Writer Posted:   03/14/2017 12:03:43 PM MDT Updated:   03/14/2017 05:10:18 PM MDT Accused stalker Robert Vinyard sits in the jury box listening to testimony during his trail at the Boulder County Justice Center in August 2005. (File photo) A Boulder County judge will allow Robert Vinyard — found not guilty by reason of insanity in 2005 for stalking a Longmont woman since the 1970s — to take supervised trips away from the state hospital. Boulder District Judge Ingrid Bakke issued a written ruling Monday approving the trips, which staff at the Colorado Mental Health Institute in Pueblo say are needed to help Vinyard socialize and get over his obsession with the victim. "It is clear to the court that the defendant has declined in health, both mentally and physically, since his commitment," Bakke wrote. "Because of this decline in health, the court is convinced the transition to supervised off grounds privileges is a means of slowing this decline and perhaps affording him an opportunity to progress away from his fixation with the victim." Staff at the hospital said that out-of-hospital trips — which include outings such as trips to Walmart, disc golf and eating out at restaurants — are necessary should Vinyard ever be released. Advertisement Vinyard, 62, began stalking Peggy Anderson — who later changed her name to Kaia Anderson in an effort to distance herself from Vinyard — in 1979. The two met at the University of Colorado in 1977 and were never romantically involved, but officials say Vinyard has delusions they have a connection. He was arrested in 2003 for the stalking — which included cards, phone calls, letters and personal confrontations — and was committed in 2005. While a patient at the hospital, he continued to contact Anderson through letters and phone calls. Anderson and the Boulder County District Attorney's Office objected to the supervised trips during a hearing last week, saying that there was nothing to suggest he had gotten over his obsession of Anderson. "We respect the court's decision in this matter," Boulder Deputy District Attorney Tim Johnson said in a statement. "However, we have serious concerns about Mr. Vinyard being able to leave the hospital facility, even while supervised. While his physical health has deteriorated, he maintains a strong and unshakable obsession for the victim. I don't believe his supervision in the community will diminish this obsession." But Bakke said that at this point she felt the threat to Anderson "has diminished significantly." "It should be noted the defendant is housed in an area which is not secured, and yet he has never attempted to escape. It is the opinion of the defendant's treatment providers that he is not a safety risk to the community in general. Testimony indicated his primary motivation at this time in his life is to stay out of trouble and not lose the privileges he has obtained thus far." But Bakke did say the hospital needed to make sure it communicated with Anderson. "Ms. Anderson's complaints regarding a lack of recognition regarding the harm the defendant is able to impose on her and her family by any communication, as well as a lack of communication with her about the defendant and his status at the hospital has merit," Bakke wrote. "Hopefully better efforts will be made to work with her during this transition in privileges in order to assuage her fears and allow her to feel as though her input matters and will be considered as the defendant's treatment moves forward." In 2014, the state hospital briefly planned on allowing Vinyard to leave the hospital on short trips, but quickly retracted the idea, and Anderson testified that she lodged a complaint with the Colorado Department of Public Safety because she had not been notified of the 2014 plan. She said DPS found the hospital at fault, which sparked a process by which the hospital was brought into compliance with the Victims Rights Act. "It is the District Attorney's Office's hope that the state hospital will work closely with the victim to address her fears about him being in the community," Johnson said. "Efforts by the state hospital can go a long way to ensure the victim that Mr. Vinyard is being supervised and precautions are being made to address her safety concerns."

News Boeing Expanding In China As Aerospace Group Backs Tax Overhaul Boeing, a supporter of the House GOP border adjustment tax, is expanding its China manufacturing operations. (Boeing) GILLIAN RICH 3/14/2017 Reprints An aerospace industry group sent a letter to congress Friday backing Republican plans to overall the tax system as member and Dow Jones industrial average component Boeing (BA) will break ground on a new finishing plant in China by the end of the month. "We urge you to enact legislation that modernizes our tax system, allows America's businesses to better compete in the global marketplace and encourages job creation and innovation in the United States," the Aerospace Industries Association of America said in its letter to congress said according to Reuters. In a letter made public by the AIA, the group said the proposed House corporate tax reform blueprint would "benefit American businesses and American workers across the board." The blueprint would lower the corporate tax rate to 20% from 25% and would add a border adjustment tax. Last month Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, Dow industrials peer General Electric (GE) CEO Jeffrey Immelt, and other industrial exporters along with drugmakers Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY) and others wrote their own letter to congress urging support for the bill. Boeing has a lot to gain from the proposed tax overhaul. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts released a note Monday saying that Boeing's stock could jump 40% from the border adjustment tax alone. Boeing shares were down 0.2% to 178.73 on the stock market today. GE stock fell 1.1% to 29.54. Not all businesses support the House's blueprint. Wal-Mart (WMT), another Dow stock, strongly opposes a border adjustment tax, along with most retailers whose goods would become more expensive. Wal-Mart shares were up 1.1% to 70.72, retaking their 200-day moving average. While the tax blueprint is supposed to support jobs at home, Boeing will break ground on its finishing plant in Zhoushan by the end of March, according to a report from China's business media outlet Caixin out Tuesday. Boeing announced plans for the facility to finish 737s and started preliminary work in 2015 as it looks to build market share in the rapidly growing aerospace market. The workers at the plant will paint planes and install in-flight entertainment and other systems. While some work is being outsourced to China, Boeing has argued the plant will create more, not less, American jobs. "That finishing center is a location where we can add value in China, but every airplane that goes there is built in the U.S.," CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in January. "It's a great example of how growth in China creates growth in U.S. manufacturing jobs."

CDT March 14, 2017 neiman marcus1 (Photo: KHOU) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST The owners of department store chain Neiman Marcus are considering a sale of the company, among other options, as it struggles in an era of declining foot traffic and increased competition from online sellers. Neiman Marcus Group said in a statement that it is “undertaking a process to explore and evaluate potential strategic alternatives, which include the sale of the company or other assets.’’ The announcement came as the retail company reported a loss of $117.1 million in the quarter that ended Jan. 28, as compared to the $7.8 million profit the company eked out during the same three month period a year earlier. Many of retail's most iconic department stores are struggling to survive at a time when a growing number of consumers are choosing the ease of shopping online at Amazon, or gravitating toward the discounts and all-in-one shopping experience available at big box giants like Walmart. Sears announced in January that it would close 150 stores and sell its Craftsman tool brand, while Macy's closed 66 locations in its last fiscal year and is planning to close another 34. Neiman Marcus may already have a potential buyer. Canadian company Hudson's Bay which had reportedly been considering a merger with Macy's, is now interested in acquiring Neiman Marcus instead, according to CNBC which cited sources who spoke to Dow Jones. Hudson's Bay had been trying to secure funding to potentially purchase Macy's according to previous reports. But investors were hesitant about a deal that would anchor them in shopping malls which are seeing declining foot traffic. Now, Hudson's Bay is reportedly turning its attention to Neiman Marcus, which it would like to buy minus its $5 billion in debt, according to the CNBC report. Neiman Marcus, which was purchased in 2013 by Ares Management and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, planned an initial public offering two years later to help pay down its $4.9 billion in debt, according to Reorg Research. But Neiman's owners formally withdrew its bid to go public in January, says Reorg.  USA Today CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Investigation continues into report of shots fired at rodeo Viewer video: Chaos at RodeoHouston after reports of possible shooting 3 in custody after robbery at Pappas BBQ HPD responding to possible shooting at rodeo Popular gas station chain, Buc-ee's, sues roadside competitor Firefighters tackle blaze at refinery in Houston KHOU 11 Breaking News Navasota Train Death Vigil Rodeo attendees exit stadium following possible shooting Deadly fire in SE Houston More Stories Two arrests made in connection with suicide of Texas… Mar 16, 2017, 1:40 p.m. HPD: Bullet casing found on rodeo grounds, man arrested Mar 15, 2017, 10:03 p.m. 2 killed in fire at boarding house in SE Houston Mar 16, 2017, 4:40 a.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home Weather Health Detail Closings & Delays Location Search Radars Conditions Hurricane Central More...

Don’t ask why, and don’t ask how; it really doesn’t matter. What matters is that it’s there, and that the camera tilts down to see it: a visual metaphor that manages to punctuate the film in a way that can’t possibly have been intentional, saying everything you need to know about the movie while still managing to say absolutely nothing at all. Had director Richie Keen possessed even a modicum of self-effacing irony he would have opened with this shot and thrown the title on screen right then and there. And that’s “Fist Fight” in a nutshell. It isn’t even funny by accident, let alone on purpose. It’s a film where everyone shouts their dialogue BECAUSE THAT’S WHAT MAKES IT FUNNY, and where the word “f—k” is treated as both a foolproof set-up and punchline. As such, it’s just people shouting “f—k” without understanding that, like when you’re actually doing what the word means, it’s all in how you use it. This turgid, overlong cacophony of migraine-inducing noise is the feature-length equivalent of that last sketch of the night on any of the worst seasons of “Saturday Night Live,” snuck in during the final minutes before its shot and put out of our misery by the closing credits. The idea of two teachers (Charlie Day and Ice Cube) having an afterschool row in the parking lot has about five minutes’ worth of mineable material; in this case, it’s bloated, corpse-like, to eighteen times that length, decomposing gaseously before your very eyes. It’s like watching an autopsy video on the concept of humor. There are literally no jokes. It’s the aforementioned shouting (peppered at times with screeching), and a preoccupation with erect penises, masturbation, and ejaculation, all of which serve as metaphors for the People of Walmart filmmaking you’re watching. It’s unintentionally meta. Charlie Day continues to refine his performance as “Charlie Day,” while Ice Cube, who used to wear his Compton background as a seal of authenticity, continues his transformation into a safe and fuzzy Saturday morning cartoon caricature. Once upon a time, he was rapping about gang violence, or informing white America that to inner city youth, “Uncle Sam was Hitler without an oven.” Now, he’s play-fighting an actor from “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” inside a toilet stall while a nerdy kid jerks off to internet porn. Keepin’ it real! Straight-up hardcore frontin’ duties go to Day’s onscreen (and I’m pretty sure unnamed) daughter (Alexa Nisenson), who performs a song I’m happy to say I’d never heard and can’t be bothered to investigate for this review (because I’m keepin’ it real). This sequence, built around a climactic middle school talent show, is groundbreaking in its effort to raise the comedic bar. Instead of uptight old people dancing to rap music, “Fist Fight” has a pre-teen singing a rap song! With gang signs! And eff-bombs! That’s why it’s funny! KEEPIN’ IT F—KIN’ REAL! But maybe I’m off base. The audience at my preview screening spent the entire film in a near-convulsive state of hysteria so visceral that the floor was literally shaking from the stamping of feet. All the while my bitter migraine was exacerbated by the braying, hyena-like laughter fired directly into my ears. “Fist Fight” provoked a football-like response, as the crowd spent ninety-one minutes engaging the movie, directly – asking questions, repeating back every other line of dialogue, and kindly going so far as to narrate the action for the benefit of everyone else in their row (who, strangely, were all doing the same thing at the exact same time). This might have led to some missed spots on the crowd’s part, as I overheard more than one group trying to piece together the plot on the way out, or attempting to explain to their slightly slower companions the deep intricacies of the many penis jokes. In that respect, “Fist Fight” is an amazing success, as it can miss something as obvious as a (literally) shitty ending and its intended audience doesn’t even notice. Directed by Richie Keen Written by Van Robichaux, Evan Susser, and Max Greenfield Rated R for language throughout, sexual content/nudity, and drug material Trailer Share this: Email Print Like this: Like Loading...

Comments aAFont Size On the calendar of the mind, March 1 can be the first day of spring. Big deal if it's not the official start, but it's springtime nonetheless with daffodils blooming, birds singing and grass getting green. What better way to usher in springtime than to hop on a bike to welcome a new season. That is, unless it's cold with a stiff breeze to match, as it was this March 1. So we moved the first day of springtime to March 3 on our mind's calendar, perfect for a ride on the Razorback Greenway. Sixty-eight degrees beats 40 when you're pedaling into a headwind. Ah, but we were on a mission this fine Friday afternoon. Two missions, really. First, to check out the new reroute of the Razorback Greenway that's just been finished near Village on the Creeks shopping area in Rogers. Second, to see if the temporarily closed section of the Greenway that goes under Interstate 49 near the Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion might have opened. We found the biking on the reroute to be fine and dandy. A second delight was seeing the closed section is open again. To get this springtime jaunt going, we started at the Rogers Regional Sports Park at Dixieland and Hudson roads. The concrete trail for bikes and feet heads west through town, near Mathias Elementary and into a pretty meadow and woods in the Turtle Creek neighborhood. This isn't part of the Razorback Greenway, but Rogers' own trail network. There are pedestrian traffic signals to help bikers cross Olive Street and busy Walnut Street. The path returns quickly to a quieter ride en route to New Hope Road where the Razorback Greenway reroute starts. Bikers, runners and walkers pass under Interstate 49 and continue west along flowing Osage Creek toward the shops and restaurants at Village on the Creeks. There's a nice new bridge on the trail over Osage Creek, where it's worth a stop to gaze at this pretty, urban stream. Now the ride gets really nice, meandering along the lake behind Village on the Creeks, before curving north to cross Stony Brook Road at another light. The Greenway now blocks away from the original route along bustling South 52nd Street. From here the Greenway goes up a moderate hill past some upscale apartments and then joins the original Razorback Greenway route, which heads north to Bentonville. The afternoon was perfect to spend on a bike. We kept heading north, past the Horsebarn Road trailhead where kids played in the creek and took turns on the swings. The Greenway heads into Bentonville through a tunnel under the traffic on Walton Boulevard. Trail travelers pass some wetlands, meadows and go past Bentonville High School. Then it's a short ride to the downtown square or farther to Lake Bella Vista. After a water break on the square, we pedaled back toward Rogers. At New Hope Road, springtime thoughts turned to that closed section of the Greenway under the interstate. Could it be open? We pedaled south, past the Mercy Hospital trailhead. Lo and behold, the trail is open again, at least it was on March 3. Barricades were removed and we met runners and walkers headed both ways. To ride from Bella Vista to Fayetteville or vice versa, one had to take a detour on busy streets to bypass the closed section. It was a hallelujah moment to see the trail open again. That made our ride back to the sports park even more pleasant. No telling how far we pedaled to ring in springtime. There's no odometer on our handlebars that tells the distance to the inch. Same reason we don't have a digital fish weighing scale in the boat. If you catch a big old bass, you can eyeball it and say, "That fish is 6 pounds, easy," when it might really only be four and a half on the scale. Then you release the fish. "Yep. Six pounds." That little ride on the Greenway had to be 30 miles. Yep, 30 miles, easy. Flip Putthoff can be reached at fputthoff@nwadg.com or on Twitter @NWAFlip.

Source: Ellentube JACKSON, MS (WDAM) - A Mississippi kid rapper and entrepreneur from Jackson was featured on the Ellen DeGeneres show Monday.  Cory J, AKA Lil C Note was interviewed by the comedian for his rapping skills and entrepreneurial business model.  Cory sold CDs in Walmart parking lots to raise money for toys. He even gave Ellen his best sales pitch. What he did with the money piqued Ellen's interest, and landed him a coveted interview on her show.  Cory told Ellen he went to different cities in Mississippi, Tennessee and Louisiana to give away $10,000 worth of toys to children in need.  "Why did you give away your money?" Ellen asked.  "Because I am a kid, and I would love to get free toys!" Cory exclaimed.  Cory then rapped a song that is featured on the albums he has sold.  To watch the entire interview, click here.  Copyright WDAM 2017. All rights reserved.

 Amazon offers Spanish-language option BI Intelligence Mar. 14, 2017, 11:11 AM 411 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Amazon has brought Prime to Mexico Amazon would fare better than legacy retailers under a US import tax Walmart ups stake in JD.com This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "E-Commerce Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Amazon plans to release a toggle option to flip between English and Spanish on its US site over the next few weeks, reports CNET. This is a logical site update, as the US is the world’s second-largest Spanish-speaking country after Mexico, with 40 million native Spanish speakers and 10 million bilingual speakers.  Catering to Spanish-speakers in the US will allow Amazon to find additional growth in a market it already dominates. Amazon reportedly accounted for 43% of all online retail purchases in the US in 2016, meaning that the company is hitting a saturation point in the country. Expanding its language options will allow it to reach the approximately 17% of the population in the US that it's been missing. This will be a direct threat to Walmart and Target, which have heavily invested in marketing to Hispanic shoppers. Walmart, the fourth largest spender on Hispanic advertising, has focused on localizing its stores, launching marketing campaigns, and featuring more Hispanic items, such as bolillo rolls and empanadas, in areas where it has a larger Hispanic customer base. Meanwhile, Target spent $51.5 million on Hispanic media in 2013 and has been in the top 50 spenders in that category since 2004. Amazon is once again challenging these retailers as they already struggle to keep their market share.

Does a bold statement like that seem incredulous? It's not. In general, the House Republican "A Better Way" tax blueprint has many excellent attributes. The problem is that the "pay for" is a direct hit on the apparel, footwear and retail industry. It is also a direct hit on the American consumer. Sen. Tom CottonTom CottonNervous GOP senators rooting for Ryan to fail Defense secretary pulls deputy's nomination: report Medicaid rollback looms for GOP senators in 2020 MORE (R-Ark.) expressed his concerns about working Americans getting stiffed (yet again) by adding tax to consumer items: "Why would we make the stuff they get at Wal-Mart more expensive?" he asked. Will people stop shopping for clothes and go naked? That's unlikely. But, as prices rise (perhaps by 20 percent or more), consumers will buy less — and several retailers will probably go bust in the process. If anyone thinks that retail is healthy, think again. If anyone thinks it's a good idea to kick an industry when its down, speak up now or forever hold your retail peace. If BAT passes, there will be fewer retail stores to clothe you, and fewer name brands to satisfy your fashion prerogatives. ADVERTISEMENT In the last few months, the retail community has seen a string of bankruptcies including, among them Pacific Sunwear, American Apparel, Eastern Mountain Sports, Bob's Stores, Sports Chalet, Quiksilver, Aeropostale and Golfsmith.   In addition, Limited Stores, Wet Seal and Sports Authority closed their doors for good. And JCPenney plans to close up to 140 stores, Abercrombie will close 60, Sears and Kmart 150, Macy's 68, Golfsmith 59, and Crocs 160. Any legislator who thinks retailers need another tax or price hike is not in tune with the current economic environment. Sure, we may have been a tad over-retailed, and sure, e-commerce has been nibbling away at brick and mortar store, but higher retail prices from a BAT tax? Really? Many in Washington have gone to great lengths explaining what the tax is meant to do. The problem is that 98 percent of all apparel and footwear is already imported, and the Republicans' BAT only targets imports. Wearable products won't get a second chance, especially after your accountant reveals that the cost of goods sold (if imported) is no longer deductible. Lowering the tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent while eliminating deductibility for cost of goods sold is like Siegfried and Roy making an elephant disappear while creating an amazing illusion. Taxing a larger amount at a lower rate doesn't help anyone, not even the elephant that was on the stage (he was also imported, by the way). Retailers will be forced to raise prices, and consumers will be forced to pay more, give up shopping, go naked or just get angry. With logic staring legislators in the face, why would anyone be concerned that BAT could happen? Well, Congress works in mysterious ways, and the BAT has a chance to make our apparel and footwear industry the sacrificial lamb of 2017, as revenue for the plan must come from somewhere, and we are the likely target. Right now, it appears that the House of Representatives has the votes and the power to pass this tax. To his credit, President Trump hasn't taken sides on the issue. He did comment in The Wall Street Journal that he had an issue with the word "adjustment" as he is never sure what someone is "adjusting." "Anytime I hear border adjustment," he said, "I don't love it. Because usually it means we're going to get adjusted into a bad deal." However, the president could side with the House of Representatives, and then all eyes will be fixated on the Senate. Likely, the Senate will reject the House bill and submit its own version — and that's a good situation. But, with conflicting legislation, the two groups end up in "conference" where they try to reconcile their differences behind closed doors. What will happen in that room is anybody's guess. The core problem is a more than a $1 trillion revenue shortfall occurs as the tax rate is lowered from approximately 35 percent to 20 percent — and that shortfall must be made up or the legislation becomes dysfunctional. Reconcilers may just decide to add the tax to wholesale or retail, and that action will certainly initiate a national consumer-centric disaster. It will put us back on the stage with Siegfried and Roy, along with the disappearing imported elephant. So, no doom and gloom. Just understand that everyone wants tax reform, and the House Republicans have the power to make this happen — or mess it up. If BAT passes, you will be paying more for your imported consumables. You will buy less, and you will have fewer places to shop. And, those are just the facts! The economic theory that the dollar will adjust (and all will be OK) is just absolute fiction.

 MCX technology to live on in Chase Pay BI Intelligence Mar. 14, 2017, 10:11 AM 449 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Here's what's holding back wearable payments THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY EXPLAINED: The Trends Creating New Winners And Losers In The Card-Processing Ecosystem Credit cards are going the way of fax machines This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Payments Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. JPMorgan Chase has agreed to purchase the payments technology of Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX), the consortium of large merchants, including Walmart, Chili's and Kohl's, behind the now-defunct mobile wallet “CurrentC.” The move is designed to help Chase boost uptick its own mobile wallet, Chase Pay, in two ways: MCX merchants will grow Chase Pay’s merchant footprint. Chase Pay’s website lists only two merchants presently accepting it – Starbucks and Best Buy – squeezing adoption potential significantly. Other merchants, including Walmart, Shell, and Phillips 66, plan to support Chase Pay in the near future. The acquisition could accelerate that integration. And the move could give Chase capabilities to integrate with merchants both within and outside of the conglomerate. The latest play comes the heels of two smaller merchant partnerships that also grew the wallets’ acceptance. It can also give user more reason to use the wallet. In addition to places to pay, customers need good reasons to pay with the wallet — that’s why Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay have failed to catch on despite being accepted at millions of merchants. Chase can tackle the user value proposition head on with MCX’s tools, including offers and discounts that redeem automatically at checkout. Chase’s recent $10 million investment in LevelUp was similarly designed to allow customers to order ahead and pay with Chase Pay — a strong incentive to use the wallet, and one that could encourage habitual usage. The acquisition offers an unexpected afterlife for MCX. The merchant’s mobile wallet “died” in June 2016, as MCX announced it was indefinitely postponing the rollout of CurrentC due to poor results in a limited trial. Now, the technology is back to help power Chase Pay, which was already seeking out MCX partners specifically. But time will tell whether the bank's wallet is brought down by the same factors that ended MCX — namely fragmentation and too much focus on aligning its merchants’ competing interests at the expense of the end-user experience.   Retailers like Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts are winning over consumers with their mobile wallets — apps developed by stores to make it easier for their customers to pay, and to deliver valuable perks.  And these retailer wallets are leading the overall mobile wallets industry, thanks to their ability to rapidly push out innovative features like rewards programs, coupons, mobile order-ahead, and custom marketing. This may be surprising considering that retailer mobile wallets can be used only at a specific retailer’s locations; in contrast, popular universal mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay can be used at multiple retailers, as long as users are using the necessary smartphones. Ayoub Aouad, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on retailer mobile wallets that assesses what makes them so successful and which retailers can most effectively leverage the technology to push sales, traffic, and average ticket size. The report also outlines what makes these mobile wallets attractive, and discusses some of the advancements being made in the payments industry that will affect mobile wallets' growth rate. Here are some key takeaways from the report:  Retailers with large addressable user bases who are loyal, repeat visitors, will see their mobile wallets continue to be popular with consumers, especially as there continues to be slow merchant adoption of near-field communication (NFC) technology as well as weak offerings by universal mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. Loyalty programs will be a significant driver in retailer mobile wallet adoption. Companies like Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts have been able to leverage their loyalty programs to acquire mobile wallet users, which, in turn, has driven store traffic and conversion rates. By leveraging these programs, sales are expected to grow at a five-year compound annual growth rate of 68%. However, adoption will begin to decelerate as a result of increased competition by 2020. As universal mobile wallet players begin to add effective loyalty programs and coupons to their offerings, adoption for retailer-based mobile wallets is likely to slow down because these offerings are their main marketing points.  In full, the report:  Explains what hurdles universal mobile wallets have faced. Details what features retailers have adopted into their mobile wallets that have been successful   Analyzes the use cases of retailers that have successfully leveraged their mobile wallet offerings to push growth. Identifies how universal mobile wallets will eventually slow growth for retailer-based mobile wallets.  Interested in getting the full report?

(AP) — A federal judge has vacated a nearly $1 million trademark infringement award made to the owners of the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally brand. SMRI sued Walmart and a Rapid City retailer for improperly using the Sturgis trademark on merchandise. A jury awarded $912,500 to SMRI following a civil trial in October 2015. Federal Judge Jeffrey Viken has upheld SMRI's trademark rights, but set aside the jury award against the defendants. Minneapolis attorney Aaron Davis represented Rushmore Photos & Gifts in Rapid City and Walmart. He says the ruling doesn't mean the case is over, pending an appeal by the plaintiffs. But he tells the Rapid City Journal (http://bit.ly/2mnnZYY ) the judge's decision is "a huge burden off of our clients." ___ Information from: Rapid City Journal, http://www.rapidcityjournal.com Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

(AP) - A federal judge has vacated a nearly $1 million trademark infringement award made to the owners of the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally brand. SMRI sued Walmart and a Rapid City retailer for improperly using the Sturgis trademark on merchandise. A jury awarded $912,500 to SMRI following a civil trial in October 2015. Federal Judge Jeffrey Viken has upheld SMRI's trademark rights, but set aside the jury award against the defendants. Minneapolis attorney Aaron Davis represented Rushmore Photos & Gifts in Rapid City and Walmart. He says the ruling doesn't mean the case is over, pending an appeal by the plaintiffs. But he tells the Rapid City Journal (http://bit.ly/2mnnZYY ) the judge's decision is "a huge burden off of our clients."

((Joe Songer/jsonger@al.com)) Print Email Guest Voices By Guest Voices AL.com on March 14, 2017 at 7:15 AM, updated March 14, 2017 at 8:06 AM comments Daniel Tait c/o Daniel Tait  By Daniel Tait, CEO, Energy Alabama, a nonprofit advocating for clean energy policies Alabama says it is open for business, but does it really mean it? A recent piece in AL.com explored many of the ways Alabama is, in fact, closed for business when it comes to renewable energy. The AL.com profile looked at a report titled the Corporate Clean Energy Procurement Index authored by the Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade group representing large retailers like Target, Walmart, Best Buy, Home Depot, and Lowe's. Alabama's score on the index was 1.82 out of 100. The next-lowest score was a 13.60; putting Alabama about as far behind as is technically possible. We can do better and there are a lot of reasons to do so. Take a look at solar's recent break-neck growth, according to the Solar Foundation Solar Jobs Census: One out of every 50 new jobs added in the United States in 2016 was created by the solar industry, representing 2 percent of all new jobs Over the next 12 months, employers surveyed expect to see total solar industry employment increase by 10 percent to 286,335 solar workers What about Alabama? Well, brace yourself. Alabama has just 287 workers in the solar industry. Our neighbors in Tennessee have almost 3800 workers in solar, and Florida has more than 6500. So where does the difference come from, because we're not that different from Tennessee or Florida, right? It's simple, the difference is policy. Alabama needs solid market-driven policies that will let the private sector do what it does best; work. The renewable energy industry is not asking for a handout, tax credit, or special treatment. However, it does deserve fair compensation and a level playing field. Businesses and homeowners deserve a choice about where their energy comes from. They should be allowed to lease systems, enter into power purchase agreements, and receive a fair market value for their investment. Taking the shackles off the private sector in Alabama will only increase competition and create opportunity for all energy sources. If we are serious about putting Alabamians to work in high paying jobs that give their families a fighting chance, we would invest in renewable energy. It's proven to create jobs and we have some of the best solar resource in the country. The place to start? Contact your state representatives about allowing Alabama to take advantage of renewable energy. The best way to begin is to ask them for an open integrated resource plan from regulated utilities and also ask for the state to draft a comprehensive energy plan. You can also contact the Alabama Public Service Commission at 1-800-392-8050 or you can submit a complaint online. The energy market is changing fast and it all comes down to proper planning.

Box 964, Chiloquin, OR 97624 ← Yeast Is A Cause of Cancer And Turmeric Can Kill Both, Research Confirms High winds off lake turn western New York home into an ice house → Since Trump, Quiet Upstate Road Becomes a Busy Exit From U.S. Posted on March 14, 2017 by Ruth New York Times – by Rick Rojas CHAMPLAIN, N.Y. — Roxham Road is a quiet country road jutting off another quiet country road, where a couple of horses munch on soggy hay and a ditch running along the muddy pavement flows with melted snow. It cuts through a thicket of dormant trees, passing a half-dozen trailer homes and after almost a mile runs into a line of boulders and a rusted railing with a sign: Road Closed. Chris Crowningshiele has been driving a cab, on and off, for 30 years in this rural corner of upstate New York known as the North Country. He lives south of here in Plattsburgh, and his fares usually come from ferrying students from a state university there or picking shoppers up at a Walmart in his gray minivan. But in recent weeks, riders have been asking him — two, three, sometimes as many as seven times a day — to bring them to the end of Roxham Road. He is carrying them on the last leg of their journey out of the United States. Just on the other side of that sign is Canada. Border officials and aid workers there say there has been a surge in people illegally crossing from the United States in the months since President Trump was elected, many of them natives of Muslim countries making bids for asylum. Roxham Road, just a brief detour from a major border crossing on Interstate 87, has become one of the busier illegal points of entry. Mr. Crowningshiele picks up passengers in Plattsburgh, mostly at the airport or the bus station, and over the 25-mile drive north, they have told him that they had traveled from across the country. Some were migrants from Yemen and Turkey. They confided that they were fearful, of what was happening in the countries they wanted to leave behind — not just their homeland but now also the United States — and of what they faced once they stepped out of Mr. Crowningshiele’s cab. “You wonder what’s going through their heads, you know?” he said. Many of his passengers have been families, with parents carrying young children and whatever possessions they could take with them. Champlain, a small town in a rural corner of upstate New York known as the North Country.CreditTodd Heisler/The New York Times “People just want to live their life,” Mr. Crowningshiele, 48, said, “and not be scared.” Given their proximity to Canada, people around here have always had some awareness of the world beyond the border. A pop music station in Montreal comes through clearly on the radio, and it is not all that unusual to make a run to the other side to shop. But the steady stream of cabs that have started driving up Roxham Road has forced them to reckon with life on the border and decisions made in Washington in ways they never have before. This is not exactly Trump Country. In Clinton County, which includes Champlain, Hillary Clinton eclipsed Mr. Trump by 610 votes. Many residents on Roxham Road said they did not bother to vote and had followed politics just enough to feel disenchanted, if not disgusted. “I used to just blow everything off,” said Melissa Beshaw, whose house is the second to last before the border. “I was never into politics until this road became famous.” She, like some others, was quick to assign blame to Mr. Trump. Immigration advocates in Canada said the reasons for fleeing were more complicated: The president’s executive order in January on immigration that affected countries that are mostly Muslim was certainly a factor, but so were frustration with the immigration process in general and concern over anti-Muslim rhetoric. Migrants have been coming to places like Roxham Road not because they want to sneak over the border; the expectation is to walk right into the arms of the Canadian authorities. An agreement between the United States and Canada makes it virtually impossible for them to ask for asylum at a legal border crossing; Canadian border officials would have to turn them back. But a technicality allows them to bypass the agreement by illegally setting foot in Canada. “Once they get arrested, they’re already on Canadian soil,” said Jean-Sébastien Boudreault, the president of the Quebec Immigration Lawyers Association, “so we have to let them do a refugee claim.” A family that crossed into Canada from the United States was arrested by a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer.CreditTodd Heisler/The New York Times A travel document covered in snow and mud near Champlain, where migrants trying to reach Canada have become a common sight.CreditTodd Heisler/The New York Times Just after a gentle rain let up on a recent afternoon, a blue Prius with a yellow taxi sign perched on its roof approached the border. A husband and wife got out. He loaded on a backpack, a duffel bag and several shopping bags. She carried a young boy. The couple declined to speak with a reporter, though the man said they were Turkish. The family was the second spotted arriving that day on Roxham Road, with at least two other cabs coming later. By the count of the people living on the road, it was a slow day. Almost 20 people had come the day before. As the family approached the border, a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police told them it was not legal for them to enter here. If they continued, he said, they would be arrested. “I apologize about this,” the man replied, his voice unsure, “but I have to break your rules.” He paused. “I’m sorry.” The couple hopped across a narrow, mucky creek that divides the two countries. A Canadian officer gently grabbed the woman’s left arm as she held her son in the crook of her right arm, helping her up. Lawyers said families like this one were usually taken to immigration offices at the nearest legal border crossing, where they can officially ask for asylum. If they have identification and do not appear to pose a security threat, the lawyers said, they are typically released and given a bus ticket to Montreal, where they wait for a hearing on their refugee status. Many of them are staying at a Y.M.C.A. there. The border crossings, despite being freighted with emotion, happen quickly and can seem almost procedural, occurring over and over every day in recent weeks.

He said that years ago the road had been an official crossing. He certainly has noticed the pickup in traffic recently. He has seen people left at the intersection, forced to drag their suitcases a mile through the snow. His sleep apnea keeps him awake, he said, and he has seen taxis creeping up the road in the dead of night. Mr. Hogle did not vote in November and said he was “leery” of Mr. Trump. On some counts, he said, the president is “doing all right.” Mr. Trump’s campaign promises about the economy and bringing back jobs had some appeal. There are some jobs around here, mostly in warehouses, Mr. Hogle said, but he wished there was better-paying work. He used to be a forklift driver in a warehouse before a medical condition left him on disability. His wife works at a gas station and at a discount store. “I think what he set out to do, he’s doing,” Mr. Hogle, 54, said of Mr. Trump. “He’s a man of his word.” He understood the president’s motivation in pursuing his immigration policies, but the situation at his own doorstep made him question the “way he went about it.” “I can see his point of view,” he said. “He’s trying to protect the United States. It’s hard. Some are good. Not everybody’s bad. Just like the white man — you have good ones and you have bad ones. There should be something better than this.” Across the street from Mr. Hogle, Matthew Turner said the influx had been unsettling. “I’m not O.K. with it,” he said of the border crossings, “but I definitely can’t blame them.” He recently discovered the lock on his shed had been tampered with and worried that border security was not tight enough. A resident of Champlain standing near the Canadian border. CreditTodd Heisler/The New York Times “I used to hunt along the border,” said Parker Cashman, who was staying with Mr. Turner, “and there’s too many places where it’s too easy to cross.” “Maybe we need to build a wall!” Mr. Turner replied, jokingly. “Have Canada pay for it!” He pointed out that Roxham Road can be hard to find. Until recently, if you typed it into Google Maps, the pinpoint landed on a roadway on the other side of the border. “It’s almost like this road doesn’t exist,” said Mr. Turner, a 21-year-old warehouse worker. It is unclear how the border hoppers, as some call them, first found Roxham Road. There are moments when residents are frustrated by it, like the day when local television stations discovered what was happening and came out with their satellite trucks. But, mostly, they sympathize with the people passing through. Ms. Beshaw, who stays at home to raise two grandsons in her custody, said she had never had a conversation or even shared a word with the migrants. But she has watched as the taxis arrive again and again, and she sees the passengers, especially the children, getting out and trudging through rain, snow and bitter cold. An obelisk marking the boundary between the United States and Canada near Champlain.CreditTodd Heisler/The New York Times “I don’t feel sorry for the adults as much as the kids,” she said. Still, she understands their motivation. “All they want is a life like what we have,” she said. Ms. Beshaw also wishes that life for her would return to how it was just a few weeks ago. “It was a quiet road,” she said wistfully. As dusk settled in, dogs could be heard yapping through the woods, and Ms. Beshaw’s grandsons pedaled around on their bicycles, chasing each other. Before long, darkness blanketed the trees and stars freckled the vast country sky. All was quiet on Roxham Road, except for the babbling water in the ditch. Still, just over the border, Mounties were posted on a muddy hill, waiting for the next car to arrive. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/nyregion/champlain-ny-canada-migrants.html?nl=todaysheadlines&emc=edit_th_20170308&_r=0 Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

At 7 p.m. Saturday, police responded to a woman at Wal-Mart, 4104 N. Vermilion St., who told them that she had left children in her vehicle in the parking lot while she shopped inside, and at some point a man and a woman approached it and forced the two young children to get out, then drove away, leaving them in the parking lot. The children were not injured The vehicle was later found in Indianapolis in the possession of Dwayne Jackson, 24, of Peoria and Julia Hill, 22, of Chillicothe, just north of Peoria. Both were taken into custody. After a review by the Vermilion County State's Attorney's Office, arrest warrants were issued for Jackson and Hill on charges of vehicular hijacking, with bond set at $100,000. Both are currently still in custody in Marion County, Ind., on charges of possession of a stolen vehicle. The investigation into the incident continues, and anyone with information is asked to call Danville police at 217-431-2250 or, if wishing to remain anonymous, Vermilion County Crime Stoppers at 217-446-TIPS.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds subscribe Site Archive Council to hear financial report, TAB fund report Wednesday Tuesday Mar 14, 2017 at 12:01 AM Jessica Weston City Editor Jessica_Weston9 In what looks to be a full agenda, the Ridgecrest City Council will hear a presentation about the fiscal year 2016 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, also known as the CAFR. Overall, according to the CAFR, the city “is witnessing a leveling off of the recession along with mild growth.” The report will be presented by Ken Pun, of the Pun Group LLP and is available for viewing online as an agenda attachment at http://ridgecrest-ca.gov/council-agendas The report notes that any conclusions are reached based on data supplied by the city: “Responsibility for the accuracy of the data presented and completeness and fairness of the presentation, including disclosures, rests with the City.” Council will also hear a report on TAB funds and will discuss and provide direction to Mayor Peggy Breeden, who represents the city on the Indian Wells Valley Groundwater Authority Board, as to whether she should vote for the by-laws. Council will also decide whether to move forward with the bid process for the Pearson/Upjohn Parks project. FY 2016 CAFR First up on the agenda is a presentation of the CAFR for fiscal year 2016. An introductory section in the report describes the city's economic outlook in cautiously optimistic terms, noting that “[a]fter experiencing the worst economic decline in recent history, the City’s financial position has begun to stabilize with modest improvements.” The report describes the city's economic outlook as “favorable” and notes that based on data from the Economic Development Department, the city has maintained job levels and the city's unemployment rate has dropped from 6.9 to 6.1 percent. According to the report, the city received $2.69 million in revenue from Measure L during fiscal year 2016. Measure L, of course, is a 0.75 percent voter approved general fund sales tax that went into effect Oct. 1, 2012. It will end March 31, 2017. At that point, the voter approved follow-on, Measure V will kick in. Measure V increases the tax amount to 1 percent. Representatives of the city have repeatedly stated that the extra 0.25 percent will go toward road projects. Permitting and construction activity is trending upward. The report attributes some of this increase to the influence of the new Walmart Super Center which opened last year. Permits in 2016 totaled 1,305, as opposed to 615 in 2015 and 1,020 in 2014. The report notes several developments which it implies have led Ridgecrest to have a positive outlook for economic development in 2017. These include the opening of the new Walmart, the planned “entertainment project” or casino complex, and the new Tractor Supply and Harbor Freight locations. The report also mentions 450 planned jobs at NAWS as another positive. This circumstance is uncertain at the present time, however, due to President Trump's civil service hiring freeze. Other topics Also on the agenda is a report on TAB funds including permitted uses, current funding allocations and the current status of the economic development TAB grant contracts. For more on this topic, see the March 11 edition of the Daily Independent. Council is also scheduled to decide whether or not to direct Breeden to vote to approve the draft IWVGA bylaws. At the previous meeting council voted 3-2 to present comments to the full JPA board with the stipulation that council “requires a written explanation of any further objections to the recommendations.” As of the time of agenda compilation, council had not yet heard back from the groundwater authority. If they have not heard anything back by the time of the meeting, they will presumably decide how to direct Breeden to vote. The bylaw draft was already approved by the IWVGA pending approval of the member agencies. Council will also be asked to decide whether to re-bid the Upjohn/Pearson Parks Project. According to a staff report, there is some uncertainty whether staff was directed to re-bid the project due to a technical error during the bidding process when the topic was discussed at a council meeting Jan. 18. Staff is seeking clarification as to whether they should re-bid the project or not. Also on the agenda are several consent calendar items relating to construction. Council will be asked to approved notices of completion on the Gateway Boulevard project and the Bowman Road Traffic Signal and Fiber Optic Communication System Installation.

Sundeep Khanna Volkswagen has announced an initial agreement with Indian market laggard Tata Motors. Photo: Bloomberg New Delhi: Recent moves in the global automobile industry show how important the India business has been for multinational companies like Suzuki Motor Co. and what an edge their sustained success in the country has given them outside India as well. Toyota Motor Co.’s recent interest in Suzuki culminating in the announcement of a business partnership is premised on the smaller company’s 47% market share in the world’s fastest growing market for automobiles. Similarly, Volkswagen AG, under pressure following the emissions scandal that has already cost it a CEO and considerable loss of reputation, has announced an initial agreement with Indian market laggard Tata Motors. In its sights is the potentially promising domestic market which it has been unable to crack on its own. It isn’t as if India hasn’t been on the radar of Toyota and Volkswagen earlier. Both have had businesses here for over a decade now, with varying degrees of success. But with projections suggesting the Indian market is red-hot ready for growth, neither of these two global heavyweights find themselves positioned to push for leadership. Hence, the belated moves to look for another route. Unfortunately, the window of opportunity in India is beginning to close. Already in sectors like telecom, conventional automobiles, information technology and white goods, the scope for a new company to make a mark in India is limited. The early players are now entrenched incumbents. For every Suzuki, Nestlé SA, Unilever and Siemens that figured years ago that India could be the jewel in its global business, there’s been a string of multinationals that kept waiting for the right timing and didn’t show up until it was too late or if they did come in, they aborted their ventures in India way too early. French car-maker Peugeot, which recently acquired General Motors’ loss-making European brands Opel and Vauxhal, was an early entrant to India’s newly liberalized car sector. But in 1997, Peugeot, which was making 306 sedans in India, decided to stop producing cars and sold its Indian stake to partner Premier Automobiles. A fraction of the £1.9 billion it is spending on the latest acquisition may have won it bragging rights in India. For inspiration it could have checked the record of The Coca Cola Company following its re-entry into the country. The $60 million the beverage company paid in 1993 to buy Parle Exports’s best selling brands like Thums Up and Limca may well have been its smartest investment in India, killing off its strongest local competitor and also adding a strong local brand to its portfolio. Today Thums Up lords over the Indian market for colas. Late-comers to the Indian market have also included six-pack companies like Apple Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. For over 15 years, ever since it embarked on a strategy of going global in 1991, Wal-Mart chose to ignore India, intimidated perhaps by the politics surrounding organized retail in the country. Instead of working with the government to shape policy and its own strategy in the firm belief that one of the world’s youngest populations would also one day become the fastest growing consuming segment, it waited until 2007 to open its first store in the country. With growth prospects in the US quite limited, it has now spent the last 10 years trying to forge a meaningful partnership at a time when the market for organized retail in India is booming. Its six-year-old venture with Bharti Enterprises was dissolved in 2013 with the result that it has little to show for its 10-year sojourn in the country. Reams have been written about how Apple ignored India for most of the last 14 years before getting serious over the last two years. Given Indians’ appetite for iPhones, 2.5 million of which have been sold here, that should count as a significant opportunity loss. By 1984-85, Apple already had as many as five distributors in India before it appointed Raba Contel in 1985 as its sole distributor. Despite the early start, Apple never really focused on India and will probably need to invest heavily to make a significant dent now. The sheer size of the market in India, the potential upside in terms of growth as well as the opportunities to experiment that the diversity of consumer experiences present, lend heft to any multinational company’s global operations. But the time to get in is now. Otherwise it may well be too late.

But he knew there were two ways to enter the country: legally or illegally. “I always said I wanted to go legally because I was scared of the alternative,” said Hernandez, who is now 18 and in his senior year at Westhill High School. The only affordable option was to be smuggled on an underground railroad of sorts from Honduras’s border with Guatemala, through Mexico and finally over Tijuana’s border with San Diego, California. “I came home at about 6:30 p.m. one night when I was nine years old, and there’s a suitcase packed in my room,” Hernandez said. “My grandma tells me, ‘You’re going to the United States tomorrow.’” Hernandez knew the day would come. He was four years old when his mother left Honduras to find work in the U.S. She spent the next six years saving up the $11,000 it would take to get her oldest son safely across the border and away from the gang violence that had endangered their family for generations. The next morning, Hernandez and his grandmother stood in a crowded bus terminal in San Pedro Sula, the Honduran capital city. “That was a lot to take in,” Hernandez said. “I was like, ‘wow, this exists here in my country?’ Because I’m from a very small town that’s tucked in the mountains. The most modern thing about the town was that we had electricity—sometimes.” Hernandez and his grandmother met up with a Guatemalan man who had been hired to bring him to his new “Aunt Santos,” a woman who helped children cross over to the U.S. The man moved quickly, and Hernandez struggled to keep up. He was finally stopped in his tracks at the top of an escalator. “I didn’t know how to use it — I was so terrified,” Hernandez said. “If there is any metaphorical threshold I had to cross to get to the U.S., that’s it.” The journey For each crossing with Aunt Santos and her surrogates, Hernandez was given a new identity to memorize. When he arrived in Tijuana, the last stop on the long trek up the Mexican coast, he was given a fake American identity—his ticket into the U.S. Hernandez sat in the backseat of a yellow convertible at the Californian border, while his 22-year-old driver answered border agents’ questions. “We just told them we were going to Wal-Mart in San Diego to buy toys,” Hernandez said with a laugh. “And we weren’t really lying. We actually did go shopping for toys at Wal-Mart — we just never came back.” Eventually, Hernandez traveled to the east coast of Virginia, where his mother picked him up at a rest stop and brought him the rest of the way to Stamford. Proud American During the transition to American life, Hernandez had what he called his most formative moment here. Playing basketball with his younger brother, who he met for the first time in Stamford, a teenage boy rode up on a bicycle and began taunting Hernandez and his brother. “He stole our basketball, he got into our house ... he kept trying to say something to me, but I just couldn’t understand and I could tell he was getting frustrated,” Hernandez said. “Then, he spat on my face and he left.” In that moment, Hernandez realized he needed to fully commit to life as an American. He worked hard to learn English and move out of the ESL classes at Northeast Elementary School. “I didn’t have to abandon my culture, but I had to integrate into this new country,” he said. A self-described “undocumented and unafraid” Honduran-American, who orchestrated a rally for student immigrants in front of the government center earlier this month, said he is grateful for the educational opportunities he has received since moving here eight years ago. He is also now a master of language — fluent in Spanish, English, French and Italian. Heading into the final months of his high school career, Hernandez awaits permanent-residence status in preparation for college. He’s hopeful the green card will arrive by the time he starts getting letters from Harvard, the University of Chicago and NYU — his top college choices — but regardless of his status, Hernandez said he became an American a long time ago. “Being an American is more than a piece of paper to me. It’s in here,” he said, fist-pounding his chest. “To be an American is to live in the world ... to be surrounded by different cultures.” nnaughton@stamfordadvocate.com; @noranaughton Sign Up for Email Alerts Sign up for our email newsletters    Breaking News    Daily Newsletter EMAIL: Most Popular 1 Stamford restaurants get poor ratings from city 2 Stamford math whiz to graduate college at 16 3 Downtown Stamford loses trio of restaurants 4 Police: 3-year-old girl lived alone with dead mom for days 5 Calm weather day today; more snow ‘likely’ Saturday 6 Stamford cop honored for role in murder investigation 7 Despite regional appetizers, food halls yet to bust out in...

Workday adopted early as a proof-point for a cloud approach and Workday Financials. By Larry Dignan for Between the Lines | March 9, 2017 -- 11:00 GMT (03:00 PST) | Topic: Cloud Workday is betting that a new revenue recognition standard to be adopted over the next year or so will be a catalyst to highlight financial systems based in the cloud. More Cloud TV videos Cloud computing powers Nissan Leaf and will be key for autonomous driving Dunkin' Brands CISO tells how cloud solutions help them drive customer engagement and loyalty Accenture CTO Paul Daugherty on how the cloud enables the AI revolution Forrester Research's senior analyst Clement Teo gives 6 reasons why cloud is a no-brainer When Workday reported its fourth quarter results last month, executives such as Robynne Sisco spent a lot of time talking about ASC 606. In a nutshell, ASC 606 is a new revenue recognition standard that melds international accounting with the US. You can wonk out all you want on the accounting standard change here and here, but the primary CXO takeaway is that Workday adopted ASC 606 early, was dinged a bit on guidance for the new fiscal year and may have landed a entry to sell Workday Financials more. Workday beats Q4 expectations | Workday touts Amazon as latest customer win | Workday lands massive Walmart contract By being the first software company to adopt ASC 606, Sisco said Workday was aiming for two constituencies. The first was customers who needed to know they could use Workday Financials for ASC 606. The second one was investors so they could know what it means to Workday and revenue trends. Workday pulled its billings guidance due to ASC 606 and a few analysts were miffed. Sisco said Workday doesn't look at billings as a key metric internally. "There is some marketing benefit to it (ASC 606)," said Sisco. "Adopting it early shows the value of a SaaS financial system and the ability to deliver functionality ahead of the accounting change." What Sisco is hoping is that Workday Financials gets a look from enterprises, who may have already adopted Workday HCM, who are struggling to tweak legacy on-premises financial systems. "ASC 606 may allow companies to realize that this isn't the last accounting change that's going to happen." On the fourth quarter earnings conference call, Sisco outlined the following rationale for ASC 606 adoption. We elected to adopt ASC606 under the full retrospective method. As required by this method, we have fully restated FY16 and FY17 under the new standard using financial data all the way back to 2010. We were able to adopt under this method because we have detailed accessible historical data in our Workday financial system. Under this method all future reporting will be under the new standard only. We believe many companies will have difficulty accessing their data as far back as necessary and in enough detail to adopt the full retrospective method and will therefore adopt what is known as the modified retrospective method instead. Workday Financial Management functionality also supports the dual reporting under both the old and new standards, which is required under this alternative method of adoption. Simply put, Workday sees an accounting change as a marketing event. To Workday, a bet that potential customers will look at the money they will spend on customization for ASC 606 and consider cloud alternatives makes sense. "We believe a lot of companies will be looking at a wholesale shift to the cloud," said Sisco.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Business Asda offers 135,000 UK store employees £8.50 per hour as part of new contract The offered rate is £1 more than the National Living Wage of £7.44. By Kedar Grandhi March 14, 2017 04:25 GMT Asda said around 95% of its staff would gain by choosing the new contract and some of them could earn an additional £1,000 annuallyMatt Cardy/Getty Images Supermarket retailer Asda is offering a pay rise to its 135,000 store employees in Britain. The company announced on Monday (13 March) that the new £8.50 ($10.37) per hour rate would be offered from October 2017 as part of a new "Your Choice" contract. The offered rate is £1 more than the government's National Living Wage of £7.44, which is set to come into effect from 1 April 2017. The Walmart subsidiary claimed that its offer was one of the highest hourly pay rates in the UK supermarket sector. Asda said that employees accepting the new contract would benefit from flexible work timings. The supermarket chain said that this flexibility would help customers as well and would allow the company to place the right staff in the right place at the right time. A few more changes have been incorporated in the new contract like working on bank holidays if needed, annual leave of 28 days including bank holidays, all breaks being unpaid, change in the "night shift window" and an increase in night shift "premium". The Leeds-headquartered firm has assured that the renewed contract will not be a zero hours contract and staff will retain guaranteed minimum hours. It added that other non-pay benefits such as colleague discount, pension, sharesave and bonus will remain unchanged. Other geographic and role premiums will also remain the same. As per Asda's calculations, 95% of its staff would gain by choosing the new contract and some of them would earn an additional £1,000 annually. Commenting on the move, Asda senior vice president of People, Hayley Tatum said in a statement, "Our colleagues have always made Asda special. We want to be the best we can for our customers, which means not only investing in our products and prices but critically, we also need to invest in our people. "Our colleagues help our customers every day and we want to offer them a rate of pay that recognises the amazing job they do." Meanwhile, UK's general trade union GMB has reportedly given its seal of approval for the new contract. The union's general secretary Tim Roache said, "These new flexible contracts will help to ensure job security, ensure those accepting them are on the same terms and - best of all – ensure that people will earn more money as a result. The new contract offer involves quite a few changes, but as it's voluntary, this allows colleagues to choose whatever suits their circumstances best."

(John Carl D'Annibale / Times Union) Photo: John Carl D'Annibale Buy this photo Bigger ban on foam rejected 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Albany After months of public comment largely in support of Albany County expanding its ban on foam products, the county Legislature Monday defeated the bill to expand the measure. The lawmakers voted 21-16, with one abstention, opposing the expansion. The ban on polystyrene – commonly known as Styrofoam – was initially enforced in 2014 on chain food establishments only. The expansion would have encompassed all food service businesses inspected by the Albany County Health Department, but doesn't apply to raw meat, poultry or seafood sold to be cooked at home, or for appliances packaged in foam. The measure, which was sponsored by a several progressive Democrats, was voted down by the 10 minority Republicans and 11 Democrats. GOP Legislator Todd Drake of the Latham said the proposed expansion picks on small businesses and community organizations, and instead further regulation should focus on big businesses that sell foam products like Walmart and Sam's Club. "When you talk about setting the tone, it's not about cost for me," he said. "I want to set the tone that Albany County is a good place to do business." Democratic legislators favored expanding the ban out of concern about the product's environmental impact, including waste in the local landfill, and potential effects on public health. As to concerns about hurting business, Democrat Bill Reinhardt of Slingerlands told his fellow legislators before the vote: ""The economy is always changing. We're always changing what we make and what we consume. Don't just think about the status quo. Vote for innovation and our future economy." Industry lobbyists and some business owners said it would be cost prohibitive on businesses, and they called for a stronger effort to recycle foam products. Scott Wexler, executive director of the Empire State Restaurant and Tavern Association, applauded the vote's result. "Our restaurants were particularly ticked off that they were being singled out," he said. "Most of our members would like the choice, not have that decision dictated for them." He said over 100 business owners submitted letters and petitions in opposing the measure. The bill had allowed businesses to opt out if switch from foam containers to compostable or recyclable products would be a financial burden. Over 1,700 county residents and roughly 40 local small businesses submitted petitions urging legislators to expand the foam ban. "I think we we're all let down and we're disappointed that they're not listening to their constituents," said Caitlin O'Brien, with Environmental Health Advocates of New York. Foam takeout containers and coffee cups typically are the cheaper option, however there's the potential for styrene – a chemical used to make foam products that is a "reasonably anticipated" carcinogen – to leach into fatty or hot foods, according to a report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Polystyrene also takes hundreds of years – if ever – to decompose. While the county Board of Health previously said there was "insufficient data" to determine any adverse public health effects from using foam products, it recognized the ban would be beneficial for the environment and could reduce the burden on landfills. afries@timesunion.com • 518-454-5353 • @mandy_fries News Videos Most Popular 1 Boy, 10, dies after being trapped under snow pile 2 18-hour manhunt in Bethlehem ends with arrest 3 AG seized cellphone of DA Joel Abelove 4 The highest and lowest SAT scores in the Capital Region 5 Driver admits she was drunk in deadly Colonie crash 6 McDonald's tweets to Trump: 'You are actually a disgusting... 7 Be on the lookout for 'eraser challenge' a new and disturbing...

Across the U.S. about 850,000 store employees met the qualifications to receive a bonus in their March 9 paycheck. The bonus averaged $184.70 per person. Wal-Mart said more than 20,000 store employees in Arkansas received their share of the bonus along with annual pay raises for those who qualify. Store employees may earn quarterly bonuses based on store performance. In Northwest Arkansas, employees shared more than $ 1.1 million in fourth quarter bonuses. Statewide the bonus pool totaled $3.1 million, according to Wal-Mart. The retailer said in the most recent full fiscal year its store employees shared more than $700 million in bonuses. CEO Doug McMillon paid tribute to store workers with a post to his Facebook page recently. McMillon has said taking care of employees is key for the company reaching its financial goals, which is why he doled out more than $2 billion in higher pay and increased training over the past two years. Sometimes you need to say “Thank You” in an extra-special way. #TeamWalmart تم نشره بواسطة ‏‎Doug McMillon‎‏ في 9 مارس، 2017 “We’re proud to be leaders in the new world of retail. No other retailer offers as wide a range of jobs, training opportunities, room for advancement, benefits and the opportunity for financial advancement as Walmart,” said Rogers store manager Tina Budnaitis. “We have invested in wages and training to create a system that can help our associates go as far as they want to.” Wal-Mart’s top executives’ bonus pay for fiscal 2017 will be detailed in the company’s Proxy filing with the Securitiy and Exchange Commission next month. Looking at fiscal 2016, the top executives received the following cash bonus pay: • Doug McMillon $3.406 million • Brett Biggs $924,965 • Greg Foran $2.491 million • David Cheesewright $2.47 million • Rosalind Brewer $1.812 million Wal-Mart Stores is the largest employer in the state operating 127 retail stores. The retailer said it spent $8.1 billion with local suppliers and supported 46,000 suppliers jobs last year in Arkansas. Wal-Mart also said it collected $428 million in state sales tax last year and paid another $295 million in taxes to the Natural State.

Derelict malls have become attractive venues for drug addicts, homeless people and even the bodies of murdered people. Heck, why live on the cold streets of, say… Minneapolis, when there’s an empty Aéropostale to call home? Meanwhile, malls lucky enough to still operate have problems of their own. On the day after Christmas, CNN reported massive brawls and food court fights at more than a dozen malls across the country. Yikes. The age of malls is over, folks. Top retail analyst Jan Kniffen says about one-third of U.S. malls will close in the coming years. Bottom line, capitalism forces businesses to adapt or die. For companies like J.C. Penney and Sears, the chance to adapt has long passed. But what about some of America’s other great retailers? I asked my senior analyst Martin Hutchinson to drill down on the retail sector. With a handful of once-great retailers destined for the courthouse steps, we have an opportunity to profit from their demise. Hutch’s full report is below. Smart investing, Louis Basenese Chief Investment Strategist, Wall Street Daily   Question: Martin, I’m concerned about the border adjustment tax and how it will impact retailers. I’m hearing some chatter on both sides, but by and large, it’s negative. Is this going to be a net positive or negative for retailers? Martin Hutchinson: I think the border adjustment tax doesn’t have all that high a chance of being introduced. But if it is introduced, it will be a big negative for retailers, because most of them are big importers. You’ve got companies like Wal-Mart, which are importing from China. Their costs will increase by 20% with the border adjustment tax, and inevitably, that’s going to affect sales. And retailers are incredibly sales dependent. So that’s one particular factor impacting retailers — but there are several others. The main one is e-commerce, which was 8.1% of total sales in 2016, up from 7.3% in 2015. Now that’s still not a huge share of the market, but it’s eating away at the brick-and-mortar retail market steadily. And obviously, it can only get bigger. That’s a pretty big head wind, if someone else is taking market share from you every year. And then on the cost end, there are minimum wage rises. It doesn’t matter if it’s 5% or 10%. But some places are raising minimum wage to $15 like Seattle or New York City. I mean the whole state of New York is going to $12.50. That’s a huge increase in cost for low-end retailers like the Wal-Marts and Targets of this world. It doesn’t matter too much at Nordstrom, because they will pay more than that. But at the low end, it’s a big cost increase. Question: Hutch, can we talk a little bit about what seems to be the end of the mall culture in this country? I have to tell you, I try to avoid malls at all costs these days, but I had to go the other day. And it was kind of depressing. I’m one of these folks that has moved all of my purchasing, as much as I can anyhow, onto online — particularly Amazon. It’s almost depressing being in a mall these days. What can you tell us about that? Martin Hutchinson: That’s quite right, and it’s not just the world getting older. It’s that the malls are getting older as well. We were building 140 a year in the mid-1990s. But there were no new malls built from 2007–2012. Nearly 3% of malls in 2014 are dying. Which is defined as more than 40% vacancies. And if they’ve lost their anchor store, they’re in real trouble. Two hundred of 1,300 were said to be going out of business in 2016. Rising interest rates, obviously, will choke off any new construction in that area. And frankly, old, unattractive malls are just not nice places to be. They will drive people toward online. And you got some other things that will do that as well. The cost cutting, for instance, pushes people to online. For example, Eddie Lampert, who is the hedge fund guy who owns Sears, stopped cleaning the stores for several years. Now that doesn’t help traffic. As a Sears customer myself, I can assure you it was repulsing. You can generate cash through a leaseback, which Macy’s is doing currently — and Sears has done it. But Sears is now selling outright because they’re losing so much money. You can close and sell stores, which Sears and J.C. Penney are doing, but all that’s reducing your business over time. So the outlook for general retailers just isn’t very good. Question: Hutch, listening to you, it doesn’t sound like this is savable — especially for the bigger retailers. Is there a way our readers out there might be able to position themselves and profit from this? Martin Hutchinson: Well, yes, that’s what one is always looking for. The specialty retailers will do all right. For example, Ulta Beauty is expected to report good figures and is trading on 46 times earnings. That’s probably excessive. We’re in a bull market, but the specialists probably don’t have too much of a problem. But the general stores that are not on the top end have real problems. In other words, not the Nordstroms and the Neiman Marcuses of the world. And so I think we can play this fairly easily. Puts on Macy’s, for example. Its profits were down 13% in the fourth quarter. Sales are expected to be down 2% or 3% in the first quarter of 2017. Debt was just downgraded from BBB to BBB- — so one more downgrade and it’s junk. It closed 66 stores in 2016, and it plans to close another 34 this year. Now you know that’s not a happy picture, because if you’re closing stores all the time, you’re reducing your footprint and reducing your market share. The company is currently trading around $32. And the $25 January 2019 puts would cost you about $3 each. Now, if Macy’s hits its October 2008 price of $7.42, you’ll make six times your money on that trade. You’ll make 238% profit even if it gets to double its 2008 price. So overall, I think those puts at $25, costing you about $3, are a very good deal and a good value play on Macy’s — and to play the problems that retailers currently have. Question: Not a particularly uplifting conversation today, Hutchinson, especially talking about the demise of an American institution in Macy’s. But it just proves that there are profit opportunities on the downside too, if we’re willing to look for them, right? Martin Hutchinson: Very much so. Question: Thanks a lot, Hutchinson. We’ll talk to you again next week. This is Wall Street Daily signing off.

In November, Lowe’s Hardware Store debuted a bilingual customer service robot that shows users where to find specific items in-store by rolling around and taking them there itself. LoweBot, which has been spotted around several San Francisco Bay Area stores, wanders through aisles and approaches people, asking whether it can be of any service, and uses a series of cameras and lasers to navigate the shop. “I’m Lowe’s Robot helper. I can tell you where things are in the store,” announces the robot as it approaches customers. “Can I help you find something?” Both Lowe’s and Walmart appear to be using increased technological involvement in their stores to compete with the wave of online stores, such as Amazon, which allow users to find products immediately and hardly ever run out of stock.

Euphoria around the Avenue Supermarts (D-Mart) initial public offering (IPO) of equity that saw 104 times more demand than the shares on offer might have overlooked a critical factor in the company's growth so far. Namely, the predominant ownership model for its stores. The company had rapid growth in recent years, with 112 stores as of September 2016, from one in 2002. Though rapid, the net profit grew to Rs 321 crore in 2015-16 from Rs 60 crore in 2011-12, a compounded annual rate of 51.8 per cent. This, however, has been largely dependent on the predominant ownership model it chose. Including long-term lease arrangements, where the period is more than 30 years and the building is owned by the company. This is different from the rental model its peers, including Future Retail and Reliance Retail, chose. "Retail is a low-margin business. So, it is very important to not only keep the cost low but predictable," says Pinakiranjan Mishra, partner and sector leader at consutancy EY. Many of the successful retailers of the world have chosen the ownership model. US-based Wal-Mart, Dutch retail chain Ikea and American fast food chain McDonald's have thrived on it. Many Indian retailers have, however, chosen a rental model due to the high real estate cost in India. However, when rental cost became unviable, they needed to relocate the stores, which meant a decline in same-store sales (SSS) growth. "It is also a location-sensitive business. Global retailers sometimes own their stores and, in some cases, even the entire mall, to create value for the retail destination, save cost and ensure predictability of cost," says Mishra. D-Mart bucked the trend in India by choosing a cluster approach for densely populated residential areas having a majority of lower middle and middle class consumers, instead of high-street addresses. Many times, it bought land at underdeveloped locations close to such a cluster and built the property. Then, offering an 'every day low price (EDLP)' and every day low cost (EDLC)', it got regular customers. Who made the store a shoppers' destination. This is a time and capital consuming approach than renting space in developed localities. In hindsight, it helped the company in improving SSS, while peers struggled to remain at locations where rental increased sharply. "Real estate is an asset for the company. When we are making a 22-23 per cent return on capital, why should we lease properties?" says Ramakanth Baheti, finance head at Avenue Supermarts. D-Mart had tangible assets of Rs 2,300 crore as on end-December. Owning assets does not by itself ensure that stores achieve break-even faster. The company achieves this through further minimising operating costs. Beside the predominant ownership model, it procures goods directly from vendors and manufacturers, employing an efficient logistics and distribution system, and maintaining a strong focus on product assortment to minimise inventory build, supported by efficient store operations. "While others pay lease rents, we pay interest," says Baheti. The company has debt of Rs 1,400 crore, with a 9-9.5 per cent average cost of funds. The company treats its real estate as plant and machinery, and does not plan to unlock its value. However, in its draft prospectus (DRHP) for the IPO, it says the ownership model requires greater capital for opening of each store, due to which it might not be able to expand at its historical rates. The objective of the IPO seems in sync with this. The offer, likely to be priced at the top end of the price band of Rs 295-299 a share, will be Rs 1,840 crore. Of this, Rs 1,080 crore will be used to retire debt and Rs 367 crore for setting up of new stores. It also shows that having grown till now from internal accrual and debt, it is now looking for public money to bring down its cost of capital for future growth through the ownership model. "D-Mart will struggle in the coming years to continue with its predominant ownership model," says Arvind K Singhal, chairman, Technopak Advisors, which prepared a sector report at the request of D-Mart. "Availability of real estate at an affordable price is now a question. Going forward, they might have a higher mix of rentals to maintain revenue growth." 4SHARES © 2017 Business Standard     Stay Updated with Us Top 10 Stories Last Week Last Month Last Year Meet Sumeet Vyas, the poster boy of the web series...

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Business Markets US stocks close lower as energy shares drag Investors are cautious ahead of a likely interest rate hike announcement on Wednesday (15 March). By Nicole Rojas March 15, 2017 02:33 GMT A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York on 6 March 2017REUTERS/Brendan McDermid US stocks ended lower on Tuesday (14 March) as energy stocks fell ahead of a likely interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. US crude oil dropped more than 1% and the energy sector was the worst performing S&P 500 sector. The S&P 500 index dropped 8.02 points, or 0.3%, to settle at 2,365.45. The energy sector led 10 of the 11 main sectors down, with materials and industrials settling down 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively. The consumer discretionary sector was the only gainer, ending up less than 0.1%. According to MarketWatch, crude oil prices dropped 1.4% to settle at $47.72 a barrel after an OPEC report revealed production in Saudi Arabia is rising. "The continued drop in oil has got stocks rolling over again," Peter Coleman, head trader at Convvergex, told CNBC. "A little out of stocks into bonds." The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 44.11 points, or 0.2%, to end at 20,837.37. Chevron Corp and General Electric Co shares were the lead decliners, falling 1.8% and 1.1% respectively. CNBC reported that shares of Walt Disney and Wal-Mart contributed to gains. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite declined 18.97 points, or 0.3%, to close at 5,856.82. MarketWatch noted that the main indexes were only a few percentage points below their all-time highs. The Federal Open Market Committee kicked off its two-day meeting on Tuesday (14 March) and is expected to announce a rate increase after the meeting concludes on Wednesday (15 March). The market sees a 93% chance that the Fed will vote in favour of a rate hike, according to data from the CME Group. "What they have following that [rate hike], I think, is what's making people nervous," JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, told CNBC. "What will be their new targets?" The Fed is expected to vote for three rate increases this year. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield dropped to 2.595%, while the shorter-term 2-year yield briefly ticked higher at 1.38%. The US dollar index rose 0.4%, with the euro near $1.061 and the yen around 114.7 yen against the greenback. According to MarketWatch, the British pound marked its lowest level against the dollar since the start of this year, trading near $1.2152. Gold prices dropped $0.50 to settle at $1,202.60 an ounce.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) Published March 14. 2017 9:20PM  By COLLEEN LONG and DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press NEW YORK — A blustery late-season storm plastered the Northeast with sleet and snow Tuesday, paralyzing much of the Washington-to-Boston corridor but falling well short of the predicted snow totals in New York, Boston and Philadelphia. The powerful nor'easter, which came after a stretch of unusually mild winter weather that had people thinking spring was already here, unloaded 1 to 2 feet in many places inland, grounded more than 6,000 flights and knocked out power to nearly a quarter-million customers from Virginia northward. By the time it reached Massachusetts, it had turned into a blizzard, with near hurricane-force wind gusting over 70 mph along the coast and waves crashing over the seawalls. Boston ended up with 6.6 inches of snow, less than the predictions of up to a foot. It was easily the biggest storm in a merciful winter that had mostly spared the Northeast, and many weren't happy about it. "It's horrible," said retired gumball-machine technician Don Zimmerman, of Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, using a snowblower to clear the sidewalk along his block. "I thought winter was out of here. ... It's a real kick in the rear." While people mostly heeded dire warnings to stay home and off the roads, police said a 16-year-old girl was killed when she lost control of her car on a snowy road and hit a tree in Gilford, New Hampshire. In East Hartford, Connecticut an elderly man died after being struck by a snow plow truck. The storm closed schools in cities big and small, Amtrak suspended service and the post office halted mail delivery. Philadelphia and New York City got anywhere from a few inches of snow to around half a foot before the storm switched over mostly to sleet; forecasters had predicted a foot or more. In New Jersey, which saw rain or just a little snow in many areas, Gov. Chris Christie called the storm an "underperformer." But officials warned of dangerous ice. Inland areas, meanwhile, got hit hard. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Worcester, Massachusetts, received a foot or more of snow. The Binghamton, New York, area got over 2 feet, while Vernon, New Jersey, had at least 19 inches. The storm came just days after the region saw temperatures climb into the 60s, and less than a week before the official start of spring. February, too, was remarkably warm. "The winters seem to be upside down now. January and February are nice and then March and April seem to be more wintry than they were in the past," said Bob Clifford, who ventured out on an early morning grocery run for his family in Altamont, near Albany, New York. His advice: "Just hide inside. Hibernate." In the nation's capital, non-essential federal employees were given the option of reporting three hours late, taking the day off or working from home. The city got less than 2 inches of snow. A few days ago, workers on Washington's National Mall were making plans to turn on the fountains. "Obviously all that has to come to an abrupt stop until we get all the snow cleared," said Jeff Gowen, the acting facility manager for the National Mall and Memorial Parks. "The cherry blossoms, they're right on the cusp of going into bloom here. I had a feeling this was going to happen." Kelly Erskine, a 28-year-old coffee shop manager from Whitman, Massachusetts, about 25 miles south of Boston, made it almost all the way through the winter without a shovel. She went to Walmart on Tuesday morning to get one. "I live in an apartment complex and they usually take care of the shoveling, but they sent a letter to us and said, 'Expect a lot of snow.' I knew from the letter that I'd have to go out and buy a shovel," she said. As the storm closed in, the National Weather Service used terms like "life-threatening" and urged people to "shelter in place," language that has come to be associated with mass shootings. In the end, the line between snow and rain shifted slightly to the west, sparing some of the Northeast's big cities. Government meteorologists realized by late Monday afternoon that there was a good chance the storm wasn't going to produce the giant big-city snow totals predicted. But they didn't change their forecast for fear people would mistakenly think the storm was no longer dangerous, said Greg Carbin, chief of forecast operations at the Weather Prediction Center. In Pennsylvania, snowplows and state troopers escorted a 23-month-old child in need of a heart transplant 80 miles between hospitals. Gov. Tom Wolf said the youngster made the trip safely. In Narragansett, Rhode Island, high winds buckled a state-owned wind turbine. In New York City, two homes under construction collapsed near the waterfront in Far Rockaway. No injuries were reported. And two ponies broke out of their stables and roamed the snowy streets of Staten Island until an off-duty police officer wrangled them with straps normally used to tow cars and tied them to a lamppost. They were taken back to the stables. "We want to thank our cowboy officer," Mayor Bill de Blasio said. The storm coincided with New Hampshire's Town Meeting Day, a Yankee tradition in which voters in more than 100 communities elect local politicians and set budgets. Some towns postponed because of the snow. But in Hopkinton, a steady stream of voters braved the blustery conditions to make it to the polls. "You know, they're hardy New Englanders, and they're coming to vote," said Debbie Norris, a candidate for the Hopkinton Budget Committee. The flight cancellations included nearly 3,300 in the New York City area alone. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at airports. Laura and Matthew Balderstone of West Yorkshire, England, intended to spend their honeymoon in Florida but found themselves stuck at the Newark, New Jersey, airport and couldn't find a hotel room. "It's better safe than sorry, especially flying. I suppose it's a shame that we can't get another way around this," Matthew Balderstone said. "It's just the way it is, unfortunately." ------ Lavoie reported from Whitman, Massachusetts.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Search continues: Family, community keep their 'Lights on for Noah' as authorities continuously comb aqueduct Tuesday Mar 14, 2017 at 5:29 PM Mar 14, 2017 at 5:36 PM Jose Quintero Staff Writer @dd_jquintero Paola Baker Staff Writer @DP_PaolaBaker HESPERIA — Thursday marks two weeks since the tragic collision that claimed the lives of a Hesperia woman and two of her children, and authorities have yet to recover the body of Noah Abbott. The 2-year-old has been missing and presumed dead since the single-vehicle crash that claimed the lives of his brother Jeremiah Abbott, 3, and their mother Christina Eileen Estrada, 31, on March 2, when their red Volkswagen convertible went through a fence on Main Street and plunged into the California Aqueduct. San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department officials said Tuesday that deputies and volunteers from the Hesperia Sheriff’s Station continue monitoring the recovery area along the aqueduct. Sheriff’s personnel and volunteers, along with community members and aqueduct employees, have monitored a 7-mile stretch of the California Aqueduct, from the scene of the crash to south of a pump station, south of Summit Valley Road. A glimmer of hope was sparked Tuesday afternoon when Sheriff’s Dispatch received a report of “something gray” seen floating in the aqueduct near Mesquite Street around 3 p.m. However, Hesperia Sheriff’s Station spokeswoman Jackie Chambers told the Daily Press the object appeared to be debris, and nothing else was found during an aerial check. As of Tuesday, Sheriff's officials say there are no updates to their ongoing investigation into the crash. “Due to the nature and severity of the collision, a time frame for the completion of the investigation cannot be established,” Chambers said. Noah's brother Elijah Estrada, 10, was the lone survivor of the crash. Elijah was pulled from the water by Dustin and Rod DeYoung, who were driving by when they saw the Volkswagen crash into the aqueduct. Elijah was transported to Loma Linda University Medical Center and suffered a gash on his head, authorities said, while Estrada was pronounced dead at the scene after emergency personnel pulled her from the water. Emergency personnel also pulled Jeremiah from the water and transported him to Desert Valley Hospital. He was pronounced dead in the emergency department. Moments before heading to the California Aqueduct to begin a community-organized sight search earlier this month, family members told the Daily Press that Noah was not strapped in a carseat during the crash. The Daily Press also learned Noah was wearing a Mickey Mouse top, jeans and tennis shoes the day of the crash. Dozens of people met in the parking lot of Wal-Mart in Hesperia to take part in a sight search for Noah's body last week. The search was organized by several residents who have been following the story waiting to hear if "baby Noah" had been found. The sight search took several large groups of people to various points along the aqueduct. The organizers thought of the idea after authorities concluded the search due to zero visibility and unsafe water conditions for Sheriff’s dive team members. The dive team has been on standby in the event Noah’s body is found in the California Aqueduct, authorities said. They’ve searched the aqueduct for Noah from an area just north of the crash scene to roughly two miles south of Main Street. Dive team members searched the aqueduct for Noah the night of the crash and also two days after. But their efforts were suspended due to darkness and low visibility. The search resumed the morning after the crash when authorities stopped the flow of a portion of the California Aqueduct. Despite the tragedy, family members refuse to lose hope that Noah will soon be found. Siblings, cousins, and friends laughed and cried together as they reminisced about the Hesperia mother and her two boys and pledged to keep their “lights on for Noah” during a candlelight vigil last Friday. “Though my physical body is in pain, my spirit is ecstatic, because I know Christina’s in paradise surrounded by her boys — all three of them — and I’ll see her again soon,” Estrada’s brother, Johnny Estrada, said. A celebration of life for Estrada and the Abbott boys will be held at Abundant Living Family Church, located at 17555 Mauna Loa Street, at 11 a.m. Friday. The public is invited to attend.

One quarter of them are children. More than 57,000 veterans are homeless each night, and nearly 5,000 of those are female. Twenty percent to 25 percent of the homeless suffer from mental illness. This is a very sad reality. I see a homeless person many times when I shop at Walmart. They are holding signs asking for help. Some are young, others are older. I also see them walking along side roads. We are demolishing many empty buildings everywhere. Why not restore them for the homeless? That would give many people shelter and get them off the streets. Those people deserve better and need help. Obviously, our government is not doing enough. Imagine living out there in all kinds of weather like a stray dog. God bless the homeless.

Saudi Arabia told OPEC it increased production in February, putting it above 10 million barrels a day but still below a production limit agreed upon between producers in an effort to stem the global glut. Saudi Arabia increased production to 10.01 million barrels a day in February, up from 9.75 million barrels a day in the previous month, but below the 10.47 million barrels a day produced in December, according to OPEC’s monthly report. “Despite the supply adjustment, stocks have continued to rise, not just in the US, but also in Europe,” OPEC noted.” Nevertheless, prices have undoubtedly been provided a floor by the production accords.” “The speculative community is heavily stacked to the bullish side, buoyed by OPEC’s renewed willingness to correct market oversupply and underpinned by early indications of historically high conformity,” OPEC added. Saudi Arabia placed extra crude into storage at domestic refineries and terminals rather than sending it to international markets, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with policy. Wall Street slid. In 1.26pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4 percent. In 1.12pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index retreated 0.5 percent. The Federal Open Market Committee began its two-day meeting and is widely expected to announce an interest rate increase on Wednesday. Investors will scrutinise clues on whether policy makers now see a steeper pace of rate hikes ahead. “It’s a foregone conclusion that the Fed will raise rates, but there is an expectation that the central bank may raise their expectation from three hikes this year to four,” Michael Scanlon, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston, told Reuters. In the Dow, slides in shares of Chevron and those of Caterpillar, down 1.6 percent and 1 percent respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Wal-Mart and those of Nike, up 1.6 percent and 1.3 percent respectively. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the day with 0.3 percent decrease from the previous close. Germany’s DAX Index inched 0.01 percent lower, while the UK’s FTSE 100 Index slipped 0.1 percent, and France’s CAC 40 Index dropped 0.5 percent. In the Netherlands, the benchmark AEX Index shed 0.4 percent a day before Dutch elections. Opinion polls were split, with two showing Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s Liberals ahead of the anti-Islam, anti-European Union Freedom Party and the other showing the two parties tied, according to Bloomberg. In fresh deal news, shares of Brazil’s JBS rose, up 2.5 percent in afternoon trading in Sao Paulo, after the world’s top meat processor said it agreed to buy US-based Plumrose, which produces ham and bacon, for US$230 million. The acquisition, a deal between JBS USA and Danish Crown, includes five prepared foods facilities located in Indiana, Iowa, Mississippi and Vermont and two distribution centres located in Indiana and Mississippi, JBS said in a securities filing. “The acquisition of Plumrose is a continuation of JBS’ strategy of expanding its portfolio of branded, high value added prepared foods, and strengthens its customer base and geographical distribution in the United States,” JBS said.

Posted 15 Mar 2017 06:05 Updated 15 Mar 2017 06:25 The Beef Products Inc (BPI) headquarters is pictured in Dakota Dunes, South Dakota November 19, 2012. REUTERS/Lane Hickenbottom Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: A South Dakota state judge has ordered ABC Broadcasting to face a potential US$5.7 billion defamation lawsuit claiming it damaged Beef Products Inc by referring in a series of reports to a meat product it sold as "pink slime." Judge Cheryle Gering of the Union County Circuit Court in Elk Point, South Dakota, dismissed claims against anchor Diane Sawyer, but said ABC, a unit of Walt Disney Co, and reporter Jim Avila must defend against such claims. "A jury could determine that there is clear and convincing evidence that ABC Broadcasting and Mr. Avila were reckless, that defendants had obvious reason to doubt the veracity of informants, and that they engaged in purposeful avoidance of the truth," Gering said during a hearing last month. The judge said Sawyer was different in part because "her actions as anchor, which limits her involvement in doing research," were not sufficient to establish defamation. Gering did not rule on the case's merits. Reuters obtained a transcript of the Feb. 8 hearing on Tuesday. The decision was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal. "We are pleased that the court dismissed all claims against Diane Sawyer," ABC said in a statement. "We welcome the opportunity to defend the ABC News reports at trial and are confident that we will ultimately prevail." BPI's lawyer, J. Erik Connolly, said his client looks forward to proving how ABC "engaged in a disinformation campaign against a company that produces safe and nutritious beef, leading to billions of dollars in damages and hundreds of lost jobs." A jury trial scheduled for June 5 could last eight weeks. Lean, finely textured beef is made from beef chunks, including trimmings, and exposed to tiny bursts of ammonium hydroxide to kill bacteria. BPI said ABC's reports in March and April 2012 implied that the South Dakota-based company's product was not safe, not nutritious and not even meat. The network has called BPI's lawsuit an attempt to chill media coverage of the industry and inhibit free speech. BPI has claimed up to US$1.9 billion of damages, which could be tripled to US$5.7 billion under South Dakota's Agricultural Food Products Disparagement Act. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has called BPI's product safe. But some retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, stopped selling ground beef containing it after the ABC reports. Several other defendants were previously dismissed from the case, including a former Agriculture Department microbiologist said to have coined "pink slime" in a 2002 email. The case is Beef Products Inc et al v. American Broadcasting Cos et al, First Judicial Circuit Court of South Dakota, Union County, No. 12-292.

Leonid Bershidsky Martin Schulz, the Social Democrat candidate for the German chancellorship. Photo: AFP The man who would depose Angela Merkel as German chancellor also has a global plan: to reverse the onslaught of nationalism and populism. Martin Schulz, the Social Democrat (SPD) candidate for the chancellorship, laid out that vision in Berlin on Monday, speaking to comrades from the Progressive Alliance, an international group uniting socialist parties that is a testament to Germany’s growing global political influence. Formed in 2013 as the SPD’s brainchild, it includes the major European socialist parties as well as political forces from faraway lands, such as India’s Congress and the US Democrats. Even Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton’s former campaign manager, made an appearance this year to talk about politics in the post-truth era. The Berlin convention of the alliance was all about plotting a counterattack. While centre-right parties have appeared too technocratic and out of touch, the left didn’t have that problem, Schulz and the other assembled socialists declared. But they needed to rally behind big ideas in order to gain traction. “The currently predominant pessimism about change and progress comes from years of politics based on an alleged lack of alternatives—and thus consolidates existing power structures,” said a report prepared for the Alliance conference by an international group backed by German foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel and former World Trade Organization director general Pascal Lamy. Schulz’s speech on Monday was all about fixing globalization. Nationalism and protectionism wouldn’t work, he argued, because “no wall can ever be high enough to protect us permanently from global problems”. So socialists must force business to correct the social consequences of globalization. “We need accountability and transparency obligations for companies along the supply chains, the extension of social security systems, and the introduction of wages that can guarantee a standard of living,” Schulz said. The socialists put the blame for the rise of nationalist populism on “neoliberals” whose economic orthodoxy gripped the world when many people thought history was ending. It was these unabashed capitalists who led the world to its current shaky state, creating the refugee problem with “wrong political decisions, environmental changes, failing states, destroyed production conditions and human livelihoods, and conflicts”, the Progressive Alliance report said. All that happened because the world was being governed in the interests of big business, which grew at the expense of everyone else: “Of the world’s 100 biggest ‘economies’, 69 are transnational corporations, Walmart being in 10th place, before Spain, Australia and the Netherlands.” The Progressive Alliance report is essentially a generalized draft programme for socialist parties everywhere. Schulz is already pushing it in Germany—with unexpected success, born perhaps of a public fatigue with Merkel’s 11-year rule. Schulz’s message is about increasing worker protections and reversing a 14-year-old labour market reform, widely credited with giving Germany an economic advantage over France with its less flexible labour rules. An unabashed internationalist, Schulz is against tightening border protections. If Merkel’s decision to open Germany to asylum seekers were indeed her biggest problem, Schulz should fare worse than her—and yet, as the SPD draws even with Merkel’s Christian Democrats or even overtakes them, the far-right Alternative for Germany party keeps losing support. The problem with the model offered by the Progressive Alliance ideologists is that even though it appears to work in Germany, where the far right never had much of a chance, it may be far less attractive elsewhere. The far right in the Netherlands and France talks about taxing the rich and protecting the working man, but also about securing the borders and prioritizing local, not global problems. It’ll be hard to sell them a plan that reduces migration by forcing multinationals to pay better wages overseas. The progressives struggle to offer simple solutions without compromising their internationalist principles, and that is, as ever, their weak point. It’s socialism’s old slogan—“Workers of the world, unite!”—without the all-or-nothing revolutionary implications. In countries with strong populist movements, a less tame version of socialism than the Berlin-minted one is rising. The GreenLeft in the Netherlands, poised to do well in the forthcoming parliamentary election thanks to the dynamic leadership of Jesse Klaver, and the French far left, which led in this election cycle by Benoit Hamon and Jean-Luc Melenchon, feel they need to offer far more ambitious ideas than Schulz does. They are, for example, in favour of a universal income, paid to each citizen to ensure a basic standard of living—an idea that appears exotic to the mainstream. But then, just 100 years ago, an 8-hour workday seemed exotic, too. The overhyped populist tidal wave appears headed for electoral defeats throughout Europe this year. If they do lose, heartened centrists may think their decades-old agenda will be enough to stall a populist takeover of democracies. But the far left may actually have a better understanding of what lies ahead: When voters want major change, they want ambitious plans, not more incrementalism. The universal basic income and other examples of big thinking—such as universal healthcare and free college in the US—may become the rallying cry on the left once the battle resumes.

Investors fixated on the Fed meeting as new data showed higher US wholesale inflation in February, raising anxiety Fed chief Janet Yellen could hint at more rate hikes this year. The Fed already was anticipating three increases this year. "It's a foregone conclusion the Fed will raise rates" on Wednesday, said Bill Lynch, director of investment at Hinsdale Associates. "The question mark is what she says afterwards at the news conference as to how aggressive they're going to be the rest of the year in raising rates." The Fed will release its latest economic forecasts Wednesday as well, including the outlook for the benchmark federal funds rate. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.2 per cent to close the session at 20,837.37. The broad-based S&P 500 shed 0.3 per cent to end at 2,365.45, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index lost 0.3 per cent to 5,856.17. Petroleum producers Marathon Oil and Chevron lost 3.3 per cent and 1.8 per cent, respectively, as oil prices continued to retreat on worries about excess supply. Gainers included Wal-Mart Stores and Nike, each up 1.1 per cent, and Tesla Motors, up 4.8 per cent. Airline shares were battered for a second day in a row as a major snowstorm in the US Northeast led to the cancelation of thousands of flights. United Continental lost 4.7 per cent and Delta Air Lines 2.3 per cent. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International plunged 10.3 per cent as activist fund Pershing Square Capital Management exited its position in the drugmaker following major losses.

The topic is a bill under discussion in Texas that would require insurance companies to cover the cost of hearing aids for children who are born with impaired hearing. Williamson sets up the debate his way: The case for the bill is exactly what you would expect, presented in exactly the way you would expect…For newborn children who can benefit from hearing aids, sooner is better: The sooner the hearing aids are in use, the better the child’s chances of normal language development. The case against the bill is exactly what you would expect, presented in exactly the way you would expect: Business groups oppose the mandate, as they oppose all additional mandates, arguing that such mandates increase the cost of health insurance for all Texans and for employers who provide insurance. This is seemingly a straightforward debate about values. Should children get hearing aids as soon as possible so that they have a good chance of normal language development, or should they be denied this health care so that Texans as a whole can enjoy slightly lower costs? But Williamson is too clever to debate on those terms. For him, it’s wrong to mandate that insurance plans cover anything, but it’s also wrong to deny children the opportunity to hear and develop normally. So the solution is to have the State of Texas man-up and offer to provide these hearing aids directly to the kids who need them. The state can budget for this (it would be expensive but not that expensive) and they can stop pretending that a mandate to an insurance company is anything other than a disguised social-welfare program. What motivates Williamson to take this stance? If you want to provide the benefit, then, for Pete’s sake, write the damned check. The alternative is not — no matter what our Democratic friends insist — getting insurance companies to pay for children’s hearing aids out of their profits and the bonuses of their fat-cat executives. What offends him isn’t the cost, since he’s happy to have Texas pay it. He’s not really concerned about the premiums people will have to pay, since that’s just a laundered way of paying the taxes that Texas would need in his preferred scenario. No, what bothers him is that when the state mandates something be covered in an insurance plan, it comes out of the “profits and the bonuses of their fat-cat executives.” Insurers might simply try to pass those costs along to subscribers in the form of higher premiums, but, contrary to the economic model that exists in the head of Bernie Sanders, companies do not have the power to unilaterally set prices. Companies in very competitive and price-sensitive businesses (think McDonald’s or Walmart) cannot simply raise consumer prices. And here I thought the problem with Obamacare was that there wasn’t enough competition to keep premiums low. In any case, I’d actually be fine with Texas paying for kids’ hearing aids instead of having it all washed through a for-profit insurance industry. It’s just that it’s kind of crazy to me that the motivation for doing that wouldn’t be to reduce cost by cutting out the middle man and instead would be to avoid cutting into the profits and bonuses of insurance executives. But it gets even more confusing, because Williamson certainly doesn’t want Texas to pay directly for kidney dialysis or chemotherapy or separating conjoined twins. That would destroy the health insurance industry and take socialism to level not seen outside the Veterans Administration. So, why hearing aids but not birth control pills or hysterectomies? There’s nothing really coherent here in terms of policy or principle. The only consistency is that Williamson thinks that health insurance executives shouldn’t suffer from anything that will interfere with their compensation, and that means that they should be able to sell crap insurance of any kind that they want with no regulation. If some benefit must absolutely be provided because the people in need are so sympathetic, then let the state do socialism in just those cases but no others.

Saudi Arabia told OPEC it increased production in February, putting it above 10 million barrels a day but still below a production limit agreed upon between producers in an effort to stem the global glut. Saudi Arabia increased production to 10.01 million barrels a day in February, up from 9.75 million barrels a day in the previous month, but below the 10.47 million barrels a day produced in December, according to OPEC’s monthly report. “Despite the supply adjustment, stocks have continued to rise, not just in the US, but also in Europe,” OPEC noted.” Nevertheless, prices have undoubtedly been provided a floor by the production accords.” “The speculative community is heavily stacked to the bullish side, buoyed by OPEC’s renewed willingness to correct market oversupply and underpinned by early indications of historically high conformity,” OPEC added. Saudi Arabia placed extra crude into storage at domestic refineries and terminals rather than sending it to international markets, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with policy. Wall Street slid. In 1.26pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4 percent. In 1.12pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index retreated 0.5 percent. The Federal Open Market Committee began its two-day meeting and is widely expected to announce an interest rate increase on Wednesday. Investors will scrutinise clues on whether policy makers now see a steeper pace of rate hikes ahead. "It's a foregone conclusion that the Fed will raise rates, but there is an expectation that the central bank may raise their expectation from three hikes this year to four," Michael Scanlon, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston, told Reuters. In the Dow, slides in shares of Chevron and those of Caterpillar, down 1.6 percent and 1 percent respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Wal-Mart and those of Nike, up 1.6 percent and 1.3 percent respectively. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the day with 0.3 percent decrease from the previous close. Germany’s DAX Index inched 0.01 percent lower, while the UK’s FTSE 100 Index slipped 0.1 percent, and France’s CAC 40 Index dropped 0.5 percent. In the Netherlands, the benchmark AEX Index shed 0.4 percent a day before Dutch elections. Opinion polls were split, with two showing Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s Liberals ahead of the anti-Islam, anti-European Union Freedom Party and the other showing the two parties tied, according to Bloomberg. In fresh deal news, shares of Brazil's JBS rose, up 2.5 percent in afternoon trading in Sao Paulo, after the world's top meat processor said it agreed to buy US-based Plumrose, which produces ham and bacon, for US$230 million. The acquisition, a deal between JBS USA and Danish Crown, includes five prepared foods facilities located in Indiana, Iowa, Mississippi and Vermont and two distribution centres located in Indiana and Mississippi, JBS said in a securities filing. "The acquisition of Plumrose is a continuation of JBS’ strategy of expanding its portfolio of branded, high value added prepared foods, and strengthens its customer base and geographical distribution in the United States," JBS said.

Cyrus Farivar - Mar 14, 2017 9:22 pm UTC Enlarge / David Charles Hahn (left), pictured here with his half brother Kevin Breeding, just months before his death in September 2016. Kenneth Hahn reader comments 95 Share this story Further ReadingThis fall, the “Radioactive Boy Scout” died at age 39Last year, Ars reported on the death of David Charles Hahn, who was profiled by Harper’s Magazine in 1998 for having attempted to build a homemade breeder nuclear reactor in his mother’s backyard shed. Hahn’s death was still being investigated by the medical examiner in Macomb County, Michigan, and it was not known whether his exposure to radiation as a teenager contributed to his death. That investigation concluded on December 2, 2016. On Tuesday, David’s father, Kenneth Hahn, called Ars to confirm that his son died of alcohol poisoning and that his previous nuclear experiments played no role in his passing. He said that he came upon our months-old request for comment while cleaning out old e-mails. Citing a toxicology and autopsy report, Kenneth Hahn said his son was found with a dangerous level of blood alcohol content, 0.404, late in the evening on September 26, 2016. The "radiation injury," he explained, refers to a small burn on David's wrist dating back to his experiments. "Dave was shopping at Walmart to get some food. It was around 10:30pm at night, and I guess he went to get some groceries," Kenneth Hahn said. "They found him in the restroom about 20 minutes later, deceased. There was no way to revive him." Kenneth Hahn added that he didn’t learn of his son’s death until the Shelby Charter Township police arrived at about 2am the following morning to inform him of the news. Prior to his death, Hahn accompanied his son to the Veterans Administration hospital for quarterly routine checkups. Medical staff there found no lingering ill effects from the earlier radiation exposure. Father and son lived about a half mile away from one another. At the time of his death, Kenneth Hahn said, David was "in school taking three classes and was going to get his ASE certification to work as a major mechanic." Kenneth Hahn said previously that his son had served as a sniper and master helmsman aboard the USS Enterprise, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. "I’m proud of my son and I’m very sad that he’s gone," he said. "He could have done a lot more in this world." David Charles Hahn was laid to rest at Great Lakes Military Cemetery in Holly, Michigan.

The Brooklyn Bridge can be seen in the background. (Reuters/Brendan McDermid) NEW YORK (AP) - A blustery late-season storm clobbered the Northeast with sleet and heavy snow Tuesday, crippling much of the Washington-to-Boston corridor, after a stretch of unusually mild winter weather that had people thinking spring was already here. The powerful nor’easter unloaded one to two feet of snow in places, grounded more than 6,000 flights, knocked out power from nearly a quarter-million customers from Virginia northward and, by the time it reached Massachusetts, had turned into a blizzard, with the wind gusting at nearly hurricane force over 70 mph along the coast and waves crashing over the seawalls. It was easily the biggest storm in a merciful winter that had mostly spared the Northeast. While people mostly heeded dire warnings to stay home and off the roads, police said a 16-year-old girl was killed when she lost control of her car on a snowy road and hit a tree in Gilford, New Hampshire. The storm closed schools in cities big and small, Amtrak suspended service and the post office halted mail delivery. Shoveling snow in Nyack, a northern suburb of New York City. (Reuters/Mike Segar) Philadelphia and New York City escaped the brunt of the snow, getting just a few inches and not the foot or more that forecasters had expected before the storm switched over mostly to sleet. In New Jersey, which saw rain or just a little snow in many areas, Gov. Chris Christie called the storm an “underperformer.” But officials warned of dangerous ice. Inland areas, meanwhile, got hit hard. Binghamton, New York, had 22 inches by mid-afternoon, while more than a foot fell in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Vernon, New Jersey, got at least 19 inches, and Monterey, Massachusetts, 15, with snow still accumulating in the afternoon. Up to a foot was expected in the Boston area. The storm came just days after the region saw temperatures climb into the 60s, and less than a week before the official start of spring. February, too, was remarkably warm. “The winters seem to be upside down now. January and February are nice and then March and April seem to be more wintry than they were in the past,” said Bob Clifford, who ventured out on an early morning grocery run for his family in Altamont, near Albany, New York. His advice: “Just hide inside. Hibernate.” In the nation’s capital, non-essential federal employees were given the option of reporting three hours late, taking the day off or working from home. The city got less than two inches of snow. A few days ago, workers on Washington’s National Mall were making plans to turn on the fountains. “Obviously all that has to come to an abrupt stop until we get all the snow cleared,” said Jeff Gowen, the acting facility manager for the National Mall and Memorial Parks. “The cherry blossoms, they’re right on the cusp of going into bloom here. I had a feeling this was going to happen.” Tourists take photos in front of the White House Tuesday morning. (Reuters/Kevin Lamarque) Kelly Erskine, a 28-year-old coffee shop manager from Whitman, Massachusetts, about 25 miles south of Boston, made it almost all the way through the winter without a shovel. She went to Wal-Mart on Tuesday morning to get one. “I live in an apartment complex and they usually take care of the shoveling, but they sent a letter to us and said, ‘Expect a lot of snow.’ I knew from the letter that I’d have to go out and buy a shovel,” she said. In northeastern Pennsylvania, snowplows and state troopers escorted a 23-month-old child in need of a heart transplant 80 miles between hospitals. Gov. Tom Wolf said the youngster made the trip safely. In Narragansett, Rhode Island, high winds buckled a state-owned wind turbine. In New York City, two homes under construction collapsed near the waterfront in Far Rockaway. No injuries were reported. And two ponies broke out of their stables and roamed the snowy streets of Staten Island until an off-duty police officer wrangled them with straps normally used to tow cars and tied them to a lamppost. They were taken back to the stables. “We want to thank our cowboy officer,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said. The storm coincided with New Hampshire’s Town Meeting Day, a Yankee tradition in which voters in more than 100 communities elect local politicians and set budgets. Some towns postponed this because of the snow. But in Hopkinton, a steady stream of voters braved the blustery conditions to make it to the polls. “You know, they’re hardy New Englanders, and they’re coming to vote,” said Debbie Norris, a candidate for the Hopkinton Budget Committee. The flight cancellations included nearly 3,300 in the New York City area alone. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at airports. Laura and Matthew Balderstone of West Yorkshire, England, intended to spend their honeymoon in Florida but found themselves stuck at the Newark, New Jersey airport and couldn’t find a hotel room. “It’s better safe than sorry, especially flying. I suppose it’s a shame that we can’t get another way around this,” Matthew Balderstone said. “It’s just the way it is, unfortunately.” Filed under: Snow, Storm, Weather Print Email Gmail Related More Snow Predicted for Parts of Northeast Forecasters Predict Less Snow for Some Parts of Northeast As Northeast Braces for Storm, Snow Wallops Syracuse Area More Snow for New England; Less for Rest of Northeast Winter Storm Threatens Cape Cod With Up to 18 Inches of Snow More in National Admitted Al-Qaida Fighter Convicted in NY Terror Case President’s Budget Makes Sweeping Cuts to EPA And State, Boosts Defense Spending Feds Investigate Threats to Jewish Centers as Hate Crimes Illinois Lawmaker Seeks $25M Anti-Terrorism Grant for Jewish Groups President Trump Entry Ban Suffers 2nd Setback in Maryland Court OP-ED The Intelligence Committee’s Hearing On Russia Won’t Satisfy Democrats A Head Start on Discrimination Antidote to Amalek More Can Be Done for Missing IDF Soldiers Mitzvos and “Making It” More Than a Buzz Cellphone Withdrawal Down the Conspiracy Rabbit Hole Laziness isn’t why People are Poor, iPhones Aren’t why they Lack Health Care.

(AP Photo/Michael Dwyer) NEW YORK — A blustery late-season storm clobbered the Northeast with sleet and heavy snow Tuesday, crippling much of the Washington-to-Boston corridor after a stretch of unusually mild winter weather that had people thinking spring was already here. The powerful nor’easter unloaded 1 to 2 feet of snow in places, grounded more than 6,000 flights, knocked out power to nearly a quarter-million customers from Virginia northward and, by the time it reached Massachusetts, had turned into a blizzard, with the wind gusting at nearly hurricane force over 70 mph along the coast and waves crashing over the seawalls. It was easily the biggest storm in a merciful winter that had mostly spared the Northeast, and many weren’t happy about it. “It’s horrible,” said retired gumball-machine technician Don Zimmerman, of Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, using a snowblower to clear the sidewalk along his block. “I thought winter was out of here. ... It’s a real kick in the rear.” While people mostly heeded dire warnings to stay home and off the roads, police said a 16-year-old girl was killed when she lost control of her car on a snowy road and hit a tree in Gilford, New Hampshire. The storm closed schools in cities big and small, Amtrak suspended service and the post office halted mail delivery.

In northeastern Pennsylvania, snowplows and state troopers escorted a 23-month-old child in need of a heart transplant 80 miles between hospitals. Gov. Tom Wolf said the youngster made the trip safely. In Narragansett, Rhode Island, high winds buckled a state-owned wind turbine. In New York City, two homes under construction collapsed near the waterfront in Far Rockaway. No injuries were reported. And two ponies broke out of their stables and roamed the snowy streets of Staten Island until an off-duty police officer wrangled them with straps normally used to tow cars and tied them to a lamppost. They were taken back to the stables. “We want to thank our cowboy officer,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said. The storm coincided with New Hampshire’s Town Meeting Day, a Yankee tradition in which voters in more than 100 communities elect local politicians and set budgets. Some towns postponed because of the snow.

Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations News US & World News Northeast clobbered with heavy snow by late-season storm Colleen Long, Denise LavoieAssociated Press Privacy Policy A blustery late-season storm plastered the Northeast with sleet and snow Tuesday, paralyzing much of the Washington-to-Boston corridor but falling well short of the predicted snow totals in New York, Boston and Philadelphia. The powerful nor'easter, which came after a stretch of unusually mild winter weather that had people thinking spring was already here, unloaded 1 to 2 feet in many places inland, grounded more than 6,000 flights and knocked out power to nearly a quarter-million customers from Virginia northward. By the time it reached Massachusetts, it had turned into a blizzard, with near hurricane-force wind gusting over 70 mph along the coast and waves crashing over the seawalls. Boston ended up with 6.6 inches of snow, less than the predictions of up to a foot. It was easily the biggest storm in a merciful winter that had mostly spared the Northeast, and many weren't happy about it. "It's horrible," said retired gumball-machine technician Don Zimmerman, of Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, using a snowblower to clear the sidewalk along his block. "I thought winter was out of here. ... It's a real kick in the rear." While people mostly heeded dire warnings to stay home and off the roads, police said a 16-year-old girl was killed when she lost control of her car on a snowy road and hit a tree in Gilford, New Hampshire. In East Hartford, Connecticut an elderly man died after being struck by a snow plow truck. The storm closed schools in cities big and small, Amtrak suspended service and the post office halted mail delivery. Philadelphia and New York City got anywhere from a few inches of snow to around half a foot before the storm switched over mostly to sleet; forecasters had predicted a foot or more. In New Jersey, which saw rain or just a little snow in many areas, Gov. Chris Christie called the storm an "underperformer." But officials warned of dangerous ice. 'Life-threatening' snowstorm clobbers the Northeast after weeks of mild weather Colleen Long, Michael Hill A sloppy late-season storm lashed the Northeast with sleet and more than a foot of snow in some places Tuesday, paralyzing much of the Washington-to-Boston corridor after a remarkably mild February had lulled people into thinking the worst of winter was over.

A sloppy late-season storm lashed the Northeast with sleet and more than a foot of snow in some places Tuesday, paralyzing much of the Washington-to-Boston corridor after a remarkably mild February had lulled people into thinking the worst of winter was over. The powerful nor'easter grounded more... (Colleen Long, Michael Hill) Inland areas, meanwhile, got hit hard. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Worcester, Massachusetts, received a foot or more of snow. The Binghamton, New York, area got over 2 feet, while Vernon, New Jersey, had at least 19 inches. The storm came just days after the region saw temperatures climb into the 60s, and less than a week before the official start of spring. February, too, was remarkably warm. "The winters seem to be upside down now. January and February are nice and then March and April seem to be more wintry than they were in the past," said Bob Clifford, who ventured out on an early morning grocery run for his family in Altamont, near Albany, New York. His advice: "Just hide inside. Hibernate." In the nation's capital, non-essential federal employees were given the option of reporting three hours late, taking the day off or working from home. The city got less than 2 inches of snow. A few days ago, workers on Washington's National Mall were making plans to turn on the fountains. "Obviously all that has to come to an abrupt stop until we get all the snow cleared," said Jeff Gowen, the acting facility manager for the National Mall and Memorial Parks. "The cherry blossoms, they're right on the cusp of going into bloom here. I had a feeling this was going to happen." Kelly Erskine, a 28-year-old coffee shop manager from Whitman, Massachusetts, about 25 miles south of Boston, made it almost all the way through the winter without a shovel. She went to Walmart on Tuesday morning to get one. "I live in an apartment complex and they usually take care of the shoveling, but they sent a letter to us and said, 'Expect a lot of snow.' I knew from the letter that I'd have to go out and buy a shovel," she said. As the storm closed in, the National Weather Service used terms like "life-threatening" and urged people to "shelter in place," language that has come to be associated with mass shootings. In the end, the line between snow and rain shifted slightly to the west, sparing some of the Northeast's big cities. Government meteorologists realized by late Monday afternoon that there was a good chance the storm wasn't going to produce the giant big-city snow totals predicted. But they didn't change their forecast for fear people would mistakenly think the storm was no longer dangerous, said Greg Carbin, chief of forecast operations at the Weather Prediction Center. In Pennsylvania, snowplows and state troopers escorted a 23-month-old child in need of a heart transplant 80 miles between hospitals. Gov. Tom Wolf said the youngster made the trip safely.

Matthew Frankel (TMFMathGuy) Mar 14, 2017 at 4:03PM If you want stocks that pay high dividends and also have the potential for market-beating long-term growth, retail real estate is one smart place to look. Despite the common misconception that retail is inherently risky, there are several retail REITs that deliver consistently strong results year after year. With that in mind, here are five of the best retail REITs in the market, all of which pay dividend yields over 4%. Company Symbol Type of Retail Recent Price Dividend Yield Realty Income O Freestanding $57.18 4.42% Simon Property Group SPG Malls $168.10 4.13% Kimco Realty KIM Shopping centers $21.55 5.00% Tanger Factory Outlet Centers SKT Outlet malls $31.18 4.18% National Retail Properties NNN Freestanding $42.19 4.30% Chart is author's own. Share prices and dividend yields are current as of 3/10/17. Image source: Getty Images. Five excellent retail REITs for the long term 1. Realty Income Realty Income (NYSE:O) primarily invests in freestanding retail properties which it leases to high-quality tenants on a net-lease basis. As of the end of 2016, Realty Income owns more than 4,900 properties, leased out to 248 different tenants, and located in 49 states plus Puerto Rico. The company's tenants and lease structure make it an inherently defensive real estate investment. Most of the tenants are recession-resistant (drug stores, gas stations, dollar stores), are immune to e-commerce competition (fitness centers, movie theaters), or both. And the tenants sign long-term (15+ year) net leases that require them to cover most of the variable expenses of property ownership such as taxes, insurance, and maintenance. This business model has resulted in a consistently high occupancy rate, as well as dividends that have increased for 77 quarters in a row. 2. Simon Property Group Mall REIT Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) is the largest REIT of any kind. It currently owns more than 200 mall properties with about 184 million square feet of space, including those operating under the "Premium Outlets" and "The Mills" brand names. One of Simon's competitive advantages, aside from its size, is its willingness to continuously reinvest in its properties and adapt to the latest in consumer trends and preferences. For example, Simon's malls have amenities like electric vehicle charging stations and free Wi-Fi. In fact, there are redevelopment projects under way at about 15% of Simon's malls as I write this. And with $7 billion in available liquidity, the company has an advantage over peers when it comes to funds available for investment. 3. Kimco Realty Kimco Realty (NYSE:KIM) owns over 500 shopping center properties with about 86 million rentable square feet. And with shopping center demand rising faster than new supply is being built, the dynamics are favorable for strong occupancy and pricing power for REITs. While tenants in shopping centers can be somewhat riskier than say, freestanding net-lease retail tenants like Realty Income's, Kimco's strength is in its diversification. The company rents space to 4,100 separate tenants, none of which makes up more than 3.4% of the total rental revenue. Tenants are on long-term leases with initial terms of 10 years or more, and Kimco deliberately fills a good portion of its properties with defensive businesses. For example, top tenants TJX Companies, Wal-Mart, and Dollar Tree actually tend to do better during tough times. 4. Tanger Factory Outlet Centers Tanger Factory Outlet Centers (NYSE:SKT) arguably has the most well-known brand name out of the REITs on the list as it owns 44 outlet centers in 22 states and Canada. Retailers who sell goods at deeply discounted prices like Tanger's tenants are resistant to e-commerce competition, and tend to weather recessions better than other types of retail businesses. As president and CEO Steven Tanger has said, "in good times people love a bargain, and in tough times people need a bargain." Demand for outlet retail is high and growing, which is one reason Tanger's portfolio is 98% occupied, and has never had an occupancy rate below 95% for any year in the company's 24-year public history. And, outlet retail may still be in its infancy. Tanger says there is less than 70 million square feet of quality outlet space in the U.S. -- less than the size of the retail space in the city of Chicago. 5. National Retail Properties National Retail Properties (NYSE:NNN) actually has a very similar business model to Realty Income, which you can read above. However, notice that I said Realty Income primarily invests in freestanding retail properties. In fact, about 20% of Realty Income's portfolio is made up of office and industrial properties. On the other hand, National Retail Properties exclusively invests in high-quality freestanding retail, making it more of a pure play on the property type. The company owns more than 2,500 properties occupied by more than 400 different tenants. The company's net-lease business model delivers consistency and growth -- at the end of 2016, 99% of the company's properties were occupied. The company has delivered market-beating returns for investors for more than two decades, and has increased its dividend for 27 consecutive years. With a rock-solid balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating (BBB+/Baa1), National Retail Properties has the financial flexibility to take advantage of growth opportunities as they come up.

Photo / AP Oil prices dropped, with US crude approaching US$47 a barrel, as Saudi Arabia pared some of its production cuts. Saudi Arabia told OPEC it increased production in February, putting it above 10 million barrels a day but still below a production limit agreed upon between producers in an effort to stem the global glut. Saudi Arabia increased production to 10.01 million barrels a day in February, up from 9.75 million barrels a day in the previous month, but below the 10.47 million barrels a day produced in December, according to OPEC's monthly report. "Despite the supply adjustment, stocks have continued to rise, not just in the US, but also in Europe," OPEC noted." Nevertheless, prices have undoubtedly been provided a floor by the production accords." "The speculative community is heavily stacked to the bullish side, buoyed by OPEC's renewed willingness to correct market oversupply and underpinned by early indications of historically high conformity," OPEC added. Saudi Arabia placed extra crude into storage at domestic refineries and terminals rather than sending it to international markets, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with policy. Wall Street slid. In 1.26pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4 percent. In 1.12pm trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index retreated 0.5 per cent. The Federal Open Market Committee began its two-day meeting and is widely expected to announce an interest rate increase on Wednesday. Investors will scrutinise clues on whether policy makers now see a steeper pace of rate hikes ahead. "It's a foregone conclusion that the Fed will raise rates, but there is an expectation that the central bank may raise their expectation from three hikes this year to four," Michael Scanlon, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston, told Reuters.

Mark Davenport WBTV i By Mark Price msprice@charlotteobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story One of Charlotte’s best-known chronically homeless men has been identified as the pedestrian killed Monday while pushing a shopping cart across Sardis Road North in southeast Charlotte. Motorists in the area say George Sumter, 62, was well known to them for pushing a shopping cart full of belongings along Monroe Road day after day. It was never clear where he was going. He died at 6:26 a.m. Monday, near Monroe Road and Sardis Road North, after stepping into the path of a Chevrolet Malibu driven by Debra Lynne Williams, 53. Homeless advocates were saddened but not surprised at the news. Sumter has been living on the city’s streets for years, in part because a traumatic brain injury left him permanently disabled. The Urban Ministry Center had been trying to get Sumter into housing the past two years. “George would sleep on whatever bench he was sitting on, and he’d go through phases where that bench would be in uptown or in Cotswold,” said Allison Winston, leader of outreach and engagement for Urban Ministry. “He was one of the most vulnerable chronically homeless individuals in Charlotte, because he had several illnesses and did not take good care of his health. He is someone who had fallen through the cracks.” Criminal records indicate Sumter may have been homeless as far back as 1995. His arrests, including one last month, typically involved trespassing or having an open container of alcohol. Both are common offenses among Charlotte’s 300-plus chronically homeless people. The chronically homeless are a segment of the homeless population that lives on the streets for years, due to addictions and disabilities. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police often listed either the Men’s Shelter of Charlotte or the Urban Ministry Center as his home. It’s unclear if he had any family in Charlotte, advocates say. There were rumors that he had once been married. Homeless advocates say Sumter was “hard to miss,” particularly in the Cotswold area, because he wore layer upon layer of clothing and went everywhere with his shopping cart. His personality was lively, too, including a claim that he frequented the Harris Teeter in the Cotswold area because the women were prettier there. “He was always entertaining,” said Winston. “He loved orange soda, McDonald’s and shopping at Wal-Mart. A few weeks ago, a case worker was visiting him in jail and he asked if he could get some McDonald’s hamburgers brought in. Never a dull moment.” Tonya Little-Reids of Matthews says she drove by the accident scene Monday and knew instantly what had happened. “I did not know this gentleman but I have interacted with him several times over the years, and when I pulled up this morning and saw his shopping cart in the street, I knew it was bad,” Little-Reids said. “I often saw him pushing his cart along Monroe Road, all the way to Matthews. I once bought him food at a Bojangles, and he didn’t want to accept it at first. He never begged. In fact, I once saw him give a $10 bill to a woman who stopped and talked to him, because he said people never would talk to him.” Charlotteans are now stepping up with offers to help bury Sumter properly, including Minister Toye Allen, who says she will provide last rites at his service. Little-Reids says she’d like to buy clothing for Sumter to be buried in. “That’s if they decide to bury him,” she says. “I feel like I need to at least make sure he is put away nice.” Mark Price: 704-358-5245, @markprice_obs George Sumter, age 62, was killed Monday while crossing Sardis Road North.

Yes No View Results  Loading ... Follow @LethHerald on twitter By Colleen Long And Denise Lavoie, The Associated Press on March 14, 2017. This satellite image taken around 12:12 a.m. EDT and released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, shows clouds around the Northeast of the United States, Tuesday, March 14, 2017. A powerful nor'easter could bring blizzard conditions and more than a foot of snow from the mid-Atlantic to parts of the Northeast, and officials warn of potential beach erosion, possible coastal flooding and power outages from the late-season snowstorm. (NOAA via AP) NEW YORK – A blustery, late-season storm clobbered the Northeast with sleet and heavy snow Tuesday, crippling much of the Washington-to-Boston corridor after a stretch of unusually mild winter weather that had people thinking spring was already here. The powerful nor’easter unloaded 1 to 2 feet of snow in places, grounded more than 6,000 flights, knocked out power to nearly a quarter-million customers from Virginia northward and, by the time it reached Massachusetts, had turned into a blizzard, with the wind gusting at nearly hurricane force over 70 mph along the coast. It was easily the biggest storm in a merciful winter that had mostly spared the Northeast, and many weren’t happy about it. “It’s horrible,” said retired gumball-machine technician Don Zimmerman, of Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, using a snowblower to clear the sidewalk along his block. “I thought winter was out of here. … It’s a real kick in the rear.” While people mostly heeded dire warnings to stay home and off the roads, police said a 16-year-old girl was killed when she lost control of her car on a snowy road and hit a tree in Gilford, New Hampshire. The storm closed schools in cities big and small, Amtrak suspended service and the post office halted mail delivery. Philadelphia and New York City escaped the brunt of the snow, getting just a few inches and not the foot or more forecasters had expected before the storm switched over to sleet. But officials warned of dangerous ice. Inland areas got hit hard. Binghamton, New York, had 22 inches by mid-afternoon, while more than a foot fell in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Vernon, New Jersey, got at least 19 inches, and Monterey, Massachusetts, 15, with snow still accumulating in the afternoon. Up to a foot was expected in the Boston area. The storm came just days after the region saw temperatures climb into the 60s, and less than a week before the official start of spring. February, too, was remarkably warm. “The winters seem to be upside down now. January and February are nice and then March and April seem to be more wintry than they were in the past,” said Bob Clifford, who ventured out on an early morning grocery run for his family in Altamont, near Albany, New York. His advice: “Just hide inside. Hibernate.” A few days ago, workers on Washington’s National Mall were making plans to turn on the fountains. “Obviously all that has to come to an abrupt stop until we get all the snow cleared,” said Jeff Gowen, the acting facility manager for the National Mall and Memorial Parks. “The cherry blossoms, they’re right on the cusp of going into bloom here. I had a feeling this was going to happen.” Kelly Erskine, a 28-year-old coffee shop manager from Whitman, Massachusetts, about 25 miles south of Boston, made it almost all the way through the winter without a shovel. She went to Walmart on Tuesday morning to get one. “I live in an apartment complex and they usually take care of the shovelling , but they sent a letter to us and said, ‘Expect a lot of snow.’ I knew from the letter that I’d have to go out and buy a shovel,” she said. In Narragansett, Rhode Island, high winds buckled a state-owned wind turbine. In New York City, two homes under construction collapsed near the waterfront in Far Rockaway. No injuries were reported. And two ponies broke out of their stables and roamed the snowy streets of Staten Island until an off-duty police officer wrangled them with straps normally used to tow cars and tied them to a lamppost. They were taken back to the stables. “We want to thank our cowboy officer,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said. The storm coincided with New Hampshire’s Town Meeting Day, a Yankee tradition in which voters in more than 100 communities elect local politicians and set budgets. Some towns postponed because of the snow. But in Hopkinton, a steady stream of voters braved the blustery conditions to make it to the polls. “You know, they’re hardy New Englanders, and they’re coming to vote,” said Debbie Norris, a candidate for the Hopkinton Budget Committee. The flight cancellations included nearly 3,300 in the New York City area alone. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at airports. Laura and Matthew Balderstone of West Yorkshire, England, intended to spend their honeymoon in Florida but found themselves stuck at the Newark, New Jersey, airport and couldn’t find a hotel room. “It’s better safe than sorry, especially flying. I suppose it’s a shame that we can’t get another way around this,” Matthew Balderstone said. “It’s just the way it is, unfortunately.” ___ Lavoie reported from Whitman, Massachusetts.

The powerful nor'easter, which came after a stretch of unusually mild winter weather that had people thinking spring was already here, unloaded 1 to 2 feet in many places inland, grounded more than 6,000 flights and knocked out power to nearly a quarter-million customers from Virginia northward. By the time it reached Massachusetts, it had turned into a blizzard, with near hurricane-force wind gusting over 70 mph along the coast and waves crashing over the seawalls. Boston ended up with 6.6 inches of snow, less than the predictions of up to a foot. It was easily the biggest storm in a merciful winter that had mostly spared the Northeast, and many weren't happy about it. "It's horrible," said retired gumball-machine technician Don Zimmerman, of Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, using a snowblower to clear the sidewalk along his block. "I thought winter was out of here. ... It's a real kick in the rear." While people mostly heeded dire warnings to stay home and off the roads, police said a 16-year-old girl was killed when she lost control of her car on a snowy road and hit a tree in Gilford, New Hampshire. In East Hartford, Connecticut an elderly man died after being struck by a snow plow truck. The storm closed schools in cities big and small, Amtrak suspended service and the post office halted mail delivery. Philadelphia and New York City got anywhere from a few inches of snow to around half a foot before the storm switched over mostly to sleet; forecasters had predicted a foot or more. In New Jersey, which saw rain or just a little snow in many areas, Gov. Chris Christie called the storm an "underperformer." But officials warned of dangerous ice. Inland areas, meanwhile, got hit hard. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Worcester, Massachusetts, received a foot or more of snow. The Binghamton, New York, area got over 2 feet, while Vernon, New Jersey, had at least 19 inches. The storm came just days after the region saw temperatures climb into the 60s, and less than a week before the official start of spring. February, too, was remarkably warm. "The winters seem to be upside down now. January and February are nice and then March and April seem to be more wintry than they were in the past," said Bob Clifford, who ventured out on an early morning grocery run for his family in Altamont, near Albany, New York. His advice: "Just hide inside. Hibernate." In the nation's capital, non-essential federal employees were given the option of reporting three hours late, taking the day off or working from home. The city got less than 2 inches of snow. A few days ago, workers on Washington's National Mall were making plans to turn on the fountains. "Obviously all that has to come to an abrupt stop until we get all the snow cleared," said Jeff Gowen, the acting facility manager for the National Mall and Memorial Parks. "The cherry blossoms, they're right on the cusp of going into bloom here. I had a feeling this was going to happen."

She went to Walmart on Tuesday morning to get one. "I live in an apartment complex and they usually take care of the shoveling, but they sent a letter to us and said, 'Expect a lot of snow.' I knew from the letter that I'd have to go out and buy a shovel," she said. As the storm closed in, the National Weather Service used terms like "life-threatening" and urged people to "shelter in place," language that has come to be associated with mass shootings. In the end, the line between snow and rain shifted slightly to the west, sparing some of the Northeast's big cities. Government meteorologists realized by late Monday afternoon that there was a good chance the storm wasn't going to produce the giant big-city snow totals predicted. But they didn't change their forecast for fear people would mistakenly think the storm was no longer dangerous, said Greg Carbin, chief of forecast operations at the Weather Prediction Center. In Pennsylvania, snowplows and state troopers escorted a 23-month-old child in need of a heart transplant 80 miles between hospitals. Gov. Tom Wolf said the youngster made the trip safely. In Narragansett, Rhode Island, high winds buckled a state-owned wind turbine. In New York City, two homes under construction collapsed near the waterfront in Far Rockaway. No injuries were reported. And two ponies broke out of their stables and roamed the snowy streets of Staten Island until an off-duty police officer wrangled them with straps normally used to tow cars and tied them to a lamppost.

The rep positioned today’s move as part of a “major restructuring to respond to the changing needs of clients, improve the quality of work … and move toward a more client-centric structure.” The ultimate goal is to facilitate agility and efficiency by reducing the size of client teams, thereby allowing the Martin organization to become “more nimble” in “adapt[ing] to what our clients need as the agency changes rapidly.” The language sounds very similar to that surrounding other recent industry changes like the round of global structural changes announced at Havas late last week. The Richmond Times published its account of the shift before we could post today, including this quote from CEO Matt Williams: “This restructuring will allow us to execute great ideas faster, respond to opportunities more quickly, and better connect with consumers. This will require a shift in our workforce toward new sets of skills and different ways to work. While these changes are critically important for us to make, this is still a very tough day for us because saying goodbye to some of our colleagues is never easy.” The Martin Agency spokesperson declined to elaborate, and we’re not aware of any account changes that precipitated the move. Last September, the organization went through a similar but slightly larger reduction directly related to Walmart’s decision to consolidate its ad business with Publicis. In that case, 29 individuals departed, accounting for 5.6% of Martin’s total workforce. Tipsters tell us that a small number of senior staffers were included in today’s announcement, but the agency did not comment directly. We have no reason to believe that other such moves will follow, and The Martin Agency has been hiring: art director Megan Sheehan joined its New York office earlier this month as a group creative director. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

I'm back to being a shutterbug again! Written by Dr. Jackass and Mr. Hide Topics: Pornography, Spy, photography, New Technology, Kellyanne Conway, Hobbies Monday, 13 March 2017 I bought this spiffy little microwave right after Kellyanne Conway said it could be used as a camera. I bought an inexpensive microwave at Bucky's Bucking Bronco Big Lots Extravaganza today. Way out there on the fringes of the city, that hideous store stands like a cinder-box outhouse on the busy thoroughfare. I'm going to take pictures with my new appliance. Yes, that's it - I plan to do very little microwaving with it and instead, will be using my new microwave as a camera. I went out and bought the thing right after I heard that Kellyanne Conway on TV say that Donald Trump's microwave was spying on him by taking pictures of our new Republican President. "Hey, that means that I can take up the hobby of being a photo-taking fool again," I thought to myself. "And I can do it on a budget that even I can easily afford!" For most of my adult life, I was involved with a profession that required me to take pictures. For publication - yes, I was a print newsman at a number of outfits and at most, being second-lead photographer came with my writing and/or editing duties and obligations. I heard Trump's girl, Conway, say this morning, "What I can say is there are many ways to surveil each other. You can surveil someone through their phones, certainly through their television sets - any number of ways." Conway added that monitoring could be done with "microwaves that turn into cameras," adding: "We know this is a fact of modern life." Well, I thought of running out right then and purchasing another 60-inch widescreen TV and using it to take photos. Then I realized how clumsy it would be, how heavy those things are, and their steep price - they start out at around a grand brand new. I could go out and buy a digital, Canon AE-1 right in its plastic in a box, along with a few choice lenses and sundry other accoutrements, at a lot less than that! What's more, I doubted, as I sat thinking about it all right then, that a used wide-screen TV at a second-hand store would have a camera built into it. This all sounds like it's a new phenomenon. Then I remembered, during a stop last week, seeing a brand-new microwave on the shelf of a deep-discount, big-lot store being sold for a little more than forty bucks. This is a lot less than it would cost for a good cell phone that could take top-notch photos or a digital camera equipped with all the bells and whistles that would allow for colorful and compelling shots snapped by even a novice picture-taker that would be suitable for the inside art of some glossy mags. I dropped everything and drove right over there to that bargain store and bought a nice, white, Microwave - a little bit bigger than the average toaster but a lot smaller than a small refrigerator (I won't mention the brand but I got it on sale of $25.99). After I bought the microwave, I went to a local public park and took pictures of some ducks and geese swimming around on a lake. After I took the roll back to Wal*Mart and had them developed on their speedy-print option, they looked good. But at the park I had to unscrew a good three-dozen bolts on the back of the microwave, lift its cover, so as to find the button deep in its innards used to snap photos. I stuck my head in there and wallah, far in the back I found a little yellow button near a 24-frame, 35mm film roll. But it was black and white film, so I drove back home and replaced it with a 36-frame roll of the same film type, only this roll was color film. It's not the best grade of film but it was good in the day for print newspaper work, so that certainly passes the mustard for my own fancy of just being a picture-taking hobbyist now. Anyhow, I had an old roll back at the homestead. It was under the sink. The microwave's only drawback turned out to be it's a lot heavier and more cumbersome than a cell phone or a digital camera. The new microwaves are much lighter than those old dinosaurs that were sold a decade-or-so ago, but still, it's hard to maneuver them around and get the perfect shot. Even though the ducks and geese were swimming slowly, they still moved and for me, trying to steady that big square box in front of me to zero in on that flock of swimming birds was very challenging. Even though they swam ever-so-slowly, I dropped the microwave twice as I tried to follow their route across the lake. My new appliance may not be able to heat soup or pop popcorn now, but at least it's still a great camera! And after being printed on glossy paper, the wood ducks on the pond - with their colorful plumage - showed a rainbow of dynamic colors and tints! And guess what? Some guy who publishes a magazine that features women wearing bikinis and skimpy lingerie gave me a gig to take pictures of a busty 45-year-old blonde who goes by the name of 'Secret'. What a lucky hound dog I am! "Be at Secret's place at 11 p.m. Thursday," this publisher ordered. "Secret gets off her shift at Hardy's Topless Diner then. She's not really the shy or skittish type, but I don't know how she'll take to having her pictures taken with a microwave. But hey, if they're good, I have plenty of work. I'll pay you ninety bucks if that microwave delivers on some good shots. I have a warning, though, Secret's a real bitch when she's tired, especially after she gets all those whistles, cat-calls, and lewd comments after a long ten hours at the diner." Whew! Ninety bucks! I hit the jackpot! After I get paid, I'm going back to Bucky's Bucking Bronco Big Lots Extravaganza and I'm buying another microwave - the same make and model as the one I just bought. As a spare, of course, since every professional photographer needs a spare picture-taking device handy. And hey man, I'll have another thirty to throw down for fishing tackle at Bucky's, too.

(AP photo) - + NEW YORK (AP) - A sloppy, blustery late-season storm lashed the Northeast with sleet and more than a foot of snow in places Tuesday, paralysing much of the Washington-to-Boston corridor after a remarkably mild February had lulled people into thinking the worst of winter was over. The powerful nor'easter grounded nearly 6,000 flights, knocked out power to almost a quarter-million customers from Virginia northward, closed schools in cities big and small and prompted dire warnings to stay off the roads. Amtrak suspended service and the post office halted mail delivery. As the morning wore on, the storm track shifted slightly and snow switched to sleet in Philadelphia and New York, prompting forecasters to lift blizzard warnings for the two big cities and cut their prediction of a foot or more of snow by over half. But Boston was still in the crosshairs, with up to a foot expected in the metropolitan area and gusts up to 75 mph forecast along the Massachusetts coast. And inland areas up and down the Northeast got clobbered. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, received at least a foot of snow, and Wantage, New Jersey, got at least 17 inches. New York's Hudson Valley had up to 20 inches by mid-afternoon. "The winters seem to be upside down now. January and February are nice and then March and April seem to be more wintry than they were in the past," said Bob Clifford, who ventured out on an early morning grocery run for his family in Altamont, near Albany, New York. His advice: "Just hide inside. Hibernate." A 16-year-old girl was killed in New Hampshire after she lost control of her car on a snowy road and hit a tree. But many other people were home, and stayed there, when the storm rolled in Monday night and Tuesday morning. "Good day to make brownies ... and or read a book," said Gov Dannel P Malloy of Connecticut, which was expecting up to 2 feet of snow in some areas. The above-ground portions of the New York subway system were shut down, and the flight cancellations included nearly 3,300 in the New York City area alone. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at airports. Laura and Matthew Balderstone of West Yorkshire, England, intended to spend their honeymoon in Florida but found themselves stuck at the Newark, New Jersey, airport and couldn't find a hotel room. "It's better safe than sorry, especially flying. I suppose it's a shame that we can't get another way around this. It's just the way it is, unfortunately," Matthew Balderstone said. In the nation's capital, the federal government announced a three-hour delayed arrival for non-emergency employees, with an option to take the day off or telecommute. The nor'easter came a week after the region saw temperatures climb into the 60s, and less than a week before the official start of spring. A few days ago, workers on Washington's National Mall were making plan to turn on the fountains. "Obviously all that has to come to an abrupt stop until we get all the snow cleared," said Jeff Gowen, the acting facility manager for the National Mall and Memorial Parks. "The cherry blossoms, they're right on the cusp of going into bloom here. I had a feeling this was going to happen." Kelly Erskine, a 28-year-old coffee shop manager from Whitman, Massachusetts, about 25 miles south of Boston, made it almost all the way through the winter without a shovel. She went to Wal-Mart on Tuesday morning to get one. "I live in an apartment complex and they usually take care of the shovelling, but they sent a letter to us and said, 'Expect a lot of snow.' I knew from the letter that I'd have to go out and buy a shovel," she said. In Narragansett, Rhode Island, high winds knocked down a state-owned wind turbine. In New York City, two homes under construction collapsed near the waterfront in Far Rockaway. No injuries were reported. And two ponies broke out of their stables and roamed the snowy streets of Staten Island until an off-duty police officer wrangled them with straps normally used to tow cars and tied them to a lamppost. They were taken back to the stables. "We want to thank our cowboy officer," Mayor Bill de Blasio said. The storm coincided with New Hampshire's traditional Town Meeting Day, when voters in more than 100 communities elect boards of selectman, library trustees and a host of other local positions, and in some locations, set their annual budgets. Some towns postponed their elections because of the snow. But in Hopkinton, a steady stream of voters braved the blustery conditions to make it to the polls. "You know, they're hardy New Englanders, and they're coming to vote," said Debbie Norris, a candidate for the Hopkinton Budget Committee. At Rosie's Liquor & Deli in Abington, about 20 miles south of Boston, business was steady as customers with the day off from work came in to buy something to get through the storm, including a woman who bought a bottle of champagne to bring to a friend's house. "Nobody's working, so everybody's drinking," said store clerk Steve Correia. Schools in New York, Philadelphia, Boston and elsewhere closed. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf said about 700 National Guard members would be deployed along with more than 2,000 snowploughs to keep up with the storm. The snow threat led college basketball teams to alter their March Madness travel plans. Villanova, top overall seed in the men's NCAA Tournament, left Philadelphia on Monday afternoon for Buffalo, New York, to get ahead of the storm. But teams in the men's and women's tournaments rely on chartered flights, so any backlog at commercial airlines shouldn't be a problem.

The powerful nor'easter, which came after a stretch of unusually mild winter weather that had people thinking spring was already here, unloaded 1 to 2 feet in many places inland, grounded more than 6,000 flights and knocked out power to nearly a quarter-million customers from Virginia northward. By the time it reached Massachusetts, it had turned into a blizzard, with near hurricane-force wind gusting over 70 mph along the coast and waves crashing over the seawalls. Boston ended up with 6.6 inches of snow, less than the predictions of up to a foot. It was easily the biggest storm in a merciful winter that had mostly spared the Northeast, and many weren't happy about it. "It's horrible," said retired gumball-machine technician Don Zimmerman, of Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, using a snowblower to clear the sidewalk along his block. "I thought winter was out of here. ... It's a real kick in the rear." While people mostly heeded dire warnings to stay home and off the roads, police said a 16-year-old girl was killed when she lost control of her car on a snowy road and hit a tree in Gilford, New Hampshire. In East Hartford, Connecticut an elderly man died after being struck by a snow plow truck. The storm closed schools in cities big and small, Amtrak suspended service and the post office halted mail delivery. Philadelphia and New York City got anywhere from a few inches of snow to around half a foot before the storm switched over mostly to sleet; forecasters had predicted a foot or more. In New Jersey, which saw rain or just a little snow in many areas, Gov. Chris Christie called the storm an "underperformer." But officials warned of dangerous ice. Inland areas, meanwhile, got hit hard. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Worcester, Massachusetts, received a foot or more of snow. The Binghamton, New York, area got over 2 feet, while Vernon, New Jersey, had at least 19 inches. The storm came just days after the region saw temperatures climb into the 60s, and less than a week before the official start of spring. February, too, was remarkably warm. "The winters seem to be upside down now. January and February are nice and then March and April seem to be more wintry than they were in the past," said Bob Clifford, who ventured out on an early morning grocery run for his family in Altamont, near Albany, New York. His advice: "Just hide inside. Hibernate." In the nation's capital, non-essential federal employees were given the option of reporting three hours late, taking the day off or working from home. The city got less than 2 inches of snow. A few days ago, workers on Washington's National Mall were making plans to turn on the fountains. "Obviously all that has to come to an abrupt stop until we get all the snow cleared," said Jeff Gowen, the acting facility manager for the National Mall and Memorial Parks. "The cherry blossoms, they're right on the cusp of going into bloom here. I had a feeling this was going to happen." Kelly Erskine, a 28-year-old coffee shop manager from Whitman, Massachusetts, about 25 miles south of Boston, made it almost all the way through the winter without a shovel. She went to Walmart on Tuesday morning to get one. "I live in an apartment complex and they usually take care of the shoveling, but they sent a letter to us and said, 'Expect a lot of snow.' I knew from the letter that I'd have to go out and buy a shovel," she said. As the storm closed in, the National Weather Service used terms like "life-threatening" and urged people to "shelter in place," language that has come to be associated with mass shootings. In the end, the line between snow and rain shifted slightly to the west, sparing some of the Northeast's big cities. Government meteorologists realized by late Monday afternoon that there was a good chance the storm wasn't going to produce the giant big-city snow totals predicted. But they didn't change their forecast for fear people would mistakenly think the storm was no longer dangerous, said Greg Carbin, chief of forecast operations at the Weather Prediction Center. In Pennsylvania, snowplows and state troopers escorted a 23-month-old child in need of a heart transplant 80 miles between hospitals. Gov. Tom Wolf said the youngster made the trip safely. In Narragansett, Rhode Island, high winds buckled a state-owned wind turbine. In New York City, two homes under construction collapsed near the waterfront in Far Rockaway. No injuries were reported. And two ponies broke out of their stables and roamed the snowy streets of Staten Island until an off-duty police officer wrangled them with straps normally used to tow cars and tied them to a lamppost. They were taken back to the stables. "We want to thank our cowboy officer," Mayor Bill de Blasio said. The storm coincided with New Hampshire's Town Meeting Day, a Yankee tradition in which voters in more than 100 communities elect local politicians and set budgets. Some towns postponed because of the snow. But in Hopkinton, a steady stream of voters braved the blustery conditions to make it to the polls. "You know, they're hardy New Englanders, and they're coming to vote," said Debbie Norris, a candidate for the Hopkinton Budget Committee. The flight cancellations included nearly 3,300 in the New York City area alone. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at airports. Laura and Matthew Balderstone of West Yorkshire, England, intended to spend their honeymoon in Florida but found themselves stuck at the Newark, New Jersey, airport and couldn't find a hotel room. "It's better safe than sorry, especially flying. I suppose it's a shame that we can't get another way around this," Matthew Balderstone said. "It's just the way it is, unfortunately." ___ Lavoie reported from Whitman, Massachusetts.

Americans’ butter consumption is forecast to jump 8 percent this year, partly thanks to hipster food trends like butter coffee and brown butter cocktails. Nutritionists are also rethinking the once-vilified food, with experts such as the Cleveland Clinic’s Dr. Mark Hyman writing in his book, “Eat Fat: Get Thin,” that butter and other saturated fats should be part of a healthy diet. The craze is spreading across all segments of the food industry, as Bloomberg News points out. McDonald’s is adding butter to its muffins and cooking with butter, while restaurant chain Cracker Barrel promotes its breakfast dishes made with “real butter.” At farmer’s markets and high-end restaurants, customers shell out for butter churned at small local dairy farms and for butter coffee, which is exactly what it sounds like: butter mixed with coffee.  Play Video Sunday Morning What's bad is good: butter Foodies will welcome any word that things once thought to be bad for your health might actually be good. And one such food, butter, is making a c... The result? American butter consumption is nearing a 50-year peak.  Like many recent trends, the Kardashians may be behind some of butter’s newfound popularity. Kourtney Kardashian has cited a type of clarified butter called ghee for helping her shed weight. “Ghee is the first thing I put in my body every morning,” she told US Magazine last year. The fat is “categorized as a healthy fat, like coconut oil, meaning the fatty acids are absorbed directly into the liver and burnt as energy.” While the argument that butter is a health food might be hard to swallow, it’s clear Americans are enjoying the food’s resurgence. Butters from all over the world are appearing at upscale grocers such as Whole Foods as well as mainstream retailers such as Krogers.  High-end butter doesn’t come cheap, however. Walmart.com sells “decadent, fresh, creamery” Irish butter for $7.99 for half a pound, for instance. Land O’Lakes butter costs $5.19 for 1 pound of butter at Jet.com. Prices have whipped up in recent months, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasting higher prices this year on “continued demand strength,” according to Dairy Herd Management.  Still, butter lovers in the U.S. won’t find their budgets spread as thin as those in the U.K., where butter prices almost doubled last year because of lower milk production.  Even with America’s revived love of butter, people don’t take the butter-rich cake when it comes to consumption. That prize goes to France, where consumers in 2015 ate an average of about 17 pounds of butter per person, compared with less than 6 pounds per year for Americans, according to the Canadian Dairy Information Centre.  Butter’s rise hasn’t gone unnoticed by margarine makers. Unilever, whose roots go back to the origins of margarine in 1872, replaced the head of its margarine business last year, raising speculation that the company might spin it off or separate it from faster-growing businesses.  © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc..

Mandates Are Government Benefits in Disguise Share article on Facebookshare Tweet articletweet Plus one article on Google Plus+1 Print Article Adjust font size AA AA AA AA AA AA AA by Kevin D. Williamson March 14, 2017 2:10 PM @kevinNR An example of what is wrong with our health-insurance/health-care system(s) can be found in a humane and well-intentioned bill in the Texas legislature what would require Texas insurance companies to cover the cost of hearing aids for children. The case for the bill is exactly what you would expect, presented in exactly the way you would expect: A public-radio story on the subject earlier this week focused on a mother describing her feelings of grief and helplessness (melancholy piano music played behind her voice, like that Sarah McLachlan song in those horrible SPCA commercials) after she discovered that her daughter was born with a severe hearing problem. For newborn children who can benefit from hearing aids, sooner is better: The sooner the hearing aids are in use, the better the child’s chances of normal language development. The case against the bill is exactly what you would expect, presented in exactly the way you would expect: Business groups oppose the mandate, as they oppose all additional mandates, arguing that such mandates increase the cost of health insurance for all Texans and for employers who provide insurance. This is true, and so the argument is met not with counter-argument but with boos and hisses. The mother in the public-radio story pronounced herself “offended” by the situation. Here is the thing: Hearing aids for children are expensive, but they are not outrageously expensive — they run about $5,000 at the higher end. According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, the number of children born with detectable hearing loss in one or both ears is about 0.2 percent. Texas has about 400,000 births a year. Assuming that all of the children born with hearing problems required $5,000 hearing aids and that none of their families had the means to pay for them, that would imply any annual outlay of $4 million for state-purchased hearing aids, i.e. roughly the municipal budget of Muleshoe, Texas. Using a more realistic estimate — that 30 percent of those children both need those hearing aids and have families that cannot pay for them — then the outlay would be something on the order of $1.2 million, which is less money than the four best-paid employees of the San Antonio city government make among them annually. Question: Who really believes that the most efficient way for the state of Texas to provide a benefit of $1.2 million to $4 million per annum to the families of 0.2 percent of the state’s newborns is . . . laundering that money through insurance companies? If you want to provide the benefit, then, for Pete’s sake, write the damned check. The alternative is not — no matter what our Democratic friends insist — getting insurance companies to pay for children’s hearing aids out of their profits and the bonuses of their fat-cat executives. For one thing, insurance companies’ profits are not looking so great in the age of Obamacare, and plans are being canceled from sea to shining sea, with the result that in many areas there are only a few insurers, and sometimes only one, offering plans in the ACA exchanges. For another thing, that simply is not how business actually works in the real world. Insurers might simply try to pass those costs along to subscribers in the form of higher premiums, but, contrary to the economic model that exists in the head of Bernie Sanders, companies do not have the power to unilaterally set prices. Companies in very competitive and price-sensitive businesses (think McDonald’s or Walmart) cannot simply raise consumer prices. They are more likely to find savings elsewhere, such as squeezing their suppliers and business partners — or their employees. In the case of an insurance company, the expense of a new mandate might be passed along in the form of higher monthly premiums, or it might be passed along in the form of less generous coverage for other expenses. It might be passed along in the form of internal work-force reductions that mean the paperwork that used to take weeks to get done will take months instead, or that that 20 minutes on hold you’re used to becomes 40 minutes. There is no way to know. But we do know this: There is no such thing as a free lunch, free birth-control pills, or free hearing aids for children, no matter how sympathetic the children are. Somebody pays. The problem is that politicians would rather not have the paper trail. If the state of Texas were to package the hearing-aid benefit as what it is — a straightforward social-welfare program — then that would mean accounting for expenditures on the state’s budget, and levying taxes to pay for them. Because politicians are cowardly creatures, they would rather have the insurance companies tax you on their behalf rather than do the thing themselves. After all, it does not end with hearing aids: Free false teeth come in all sorts of configurations. We are a very, very rich country. We can afford all sorts of things: food for the hungry, health care for the indigent, education for children, and hearing aids for families that for whatever reason cannot manage to scrape together $1,000 a year to invest in the well-being of their own children. (Those $5,000 hearing aids last for about five years, meaning that their real cost over time is less than the $1,200 a year typical American family spends on cable television.) I myself am all for doing many of those things, though I do not think that government very often is the best instrument for getting them done. But if we are going to use government, then, by all means, let’s use government in the most honest, transparent, and straightforward way we can. Forget the insurance mandate and just write the check. We can afford the hearing aids. We cannot afford the stupidity.  The Corner The one and only.

Brands are among the firms that are ranked below the 20% band range.  These companies are being urged by CHRB to “act decisively, learn from leading practices, and emulate rapidly their existing standards”...company scores are significantly skewed toward the lower percentage bands, reflecting the early stage that many companies are at when implementing the UN Guiding Principles...CHRB suggests that low-performing companies must follow the example of current industry leaders and recognise the moral imperative, business case and commercial viability of taking action on human rights.  [Also refers to Marks and Spencer (M&S), BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Nestlé, Unilever and Adidas].

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) NEW YORK (AP) — A blustery late-season storm plastered the Northeast with sleet and snow Tuesday, paralyzing much of the Washington-to-Boston corridor but falling well short of the predicted snow totals in New York, Boston and Philadelphia. The powerful nor'easter, which came after a stretch of unusually mild winter weather that had people thinking spring was already here, unloaded 1 to 2 feet in many places inland, grounded more than 6,000 flights and knocked out power to nearly a quarter-million customers from Virginia northward. By the time it reached Massachusetts, it had turned into a blizzard, with near hurricane-force wind gusting over 70 mph along the coast and waves crashing over the seawalls. Boston ended up with 6.6 inches of snow, less than the predictions of up to a foot. It was easily the biggest storm in a merciful winter that had mostly spared the Northeast, and many weren't happy about it. "It's horrible," said retired gumball-machine technician Don Zimmerman, of Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, using a snowblower to clear the sidewalk along his block. "I thought winter was out of here. ... It's a real kick in the rear." While people mostly heeded dire warnings to stay home and off the roads, police said a 16-year-old girl was killed when she lost control of her car on a snowy road and hit a tree in Gilford, New Hampshire. In East Hartford, Connecticut an elderly man died after being struck by a snow plow truck. The storm closed schools in cities big and small, Amtrak suspended service and the post office halted mail delivery. Philadelphia and New York City got anywhere from a few inches of snow to around half a foot before the storm switched over mostly to sleet; forecasters had predicted a foot or more. In New Jersey, which saw rain or just a little snow in many areas, Gov. Chris Christie called the storm an "underperformer." But officials warned of dangerous ice. Inland areas, meanwhile, got hit hard. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Worcester, Massachusetts, received a foot or more of snow. The Binghamton, New York, area got over 2 feet, while Vernon, New Jersey, had at least 19 inches. The storm came just days after the region saw temperatures climb into the 60s, and less than a week before the official start of spring. February, too, was remarkably warm. "The winters seem to be upside down now. January and February are nice and then March and April seem to be more wintry than they were in the past," said Bob Clifford, who ventured out on an early morning grocery run for his family in Altamont, near Albany, New York. His advice: "Just hide inside. Hibernate." In the nation's capital, non-essential federal employees were given the option of reporting three hours late, taking the day off or working from home. The city got less than 2 inches of snow. A few days ago, workers on Washington's National Mall were making plans to turn on the fountains. "Obviously all that has to come to an abrupt stop until we get all the snow cleared," said Jeff Gowen, the acting facility manager for the National Mall and Memorial Parks. "The cherry blossoms, they're right on the cusp of going into bloom here. I had a feeling this was going to happen." Kelly Erskine, a 28-year-old coffee shop manager from Whitman, Massachusetts, about 25 miles south of Boston, made it almost all the way through the winter without a shovel. She went to Walmart on Tuesday morning to get one. "I live in an apartment complex and they usually take care of the shoveling, but they sent a letter to us and said, 'Expect a lot of snow.' I knew from the letter that I'd have to go out and buy a shovel," she said. As the storm closed in, the National Weather Service used terms like "life-threatening" and urged people to "shelter in place," language that has come to be associated with mass shootings. In the end, the line between snow and rain shifted slightly to the west, sparing some of the Northeast's big cities. Government meteorologists realized by late Monday afternoon that there was a good chance the storm wasn't going to produce the giant big-city snow totals predicted. But they didn't change their forecast for fear people would mistakenly think the storm was no longer dangerous, said Greg Carbin, chief of forecast operations at the Weather Prediction Center. In Pennsylvania, snowplows and state troopers escorted a 23-month-old child in need of a heart transplant 80 miles between hospitals. Gov. Tom Wolf said the youngster made the trip safely. In Narragansett, Rhode Island, high winds buckled a state-owned wind turbine. In New York City, two homes under construction collapsed near the waterfront in Far Rockaway. No injuries were reported. And two ponies broke out of their stables and roamed the snowy streets of Staten Island until an off-duty police officer wrangled them with straps normally used to tow cars and tied them to a lamppost. They were taken back to the stables. "We want to thank our cowboy officer," Mayor Bill de Blasio said. The storm coincided with New Hampshire's Town Meeting Day, a Yankee tradition in which voters in more than 100 communities elect local politicians and set budgets. Some towns postponed because of the snow. But in Hopkinton, a steady stream of voters braved the blustery conditions to make it to the polls. "You know, they're hardy New Englanders, and they're coming to vote," said Debbie Norris, a candidate for the Hopkinton Budget Committee. The flight cancellations included nearly 3,300 in the New York City area alone. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at airports. Laura and Matthew Balderstone of West Yorkshire, England, intended to spend their honeymoon in Florida but found themselves stuck at the Newark, New Jersey, airport and couldn't find a hotel room. "It's better safe than sorry, especially flying. I suppose it's a shame that we can't get another way around this," Matthew Balderstone said. "It's just the way it is, unfortunately." ___ Lavoie reported from Whitman, Massachusetts.

(AP Photo/Steven Senne) NEW YORK (AP) — A blustery late-season storm plastered the Northeast with sleet and snow Tuesday, paralyzing much of the Washington-to-Boston corridor but falling well short of the predicted snow totals in New York, Boston and Philadelphia. The powerful nor'easter, which came after a stretch of unusually mild winter weather that had people thinking spring was already here, unloaded 1 to 2 feet in many places inland, grounded more than 6,000 flights and knocked out power to nearly a quarter-million customers from Virginia northward. By the time it reached Massachusetts, it had turned into a blizzard, with near hurricane-force wind gusting over 70 mph along the coast and waves crashing over the seawalls. Boston ended up with 6.6 inches of snow, less than the predictions of up to a foot. Story continues below video × Advertisement It was easily the biggest storm in a merciful winter that had mostly spared the Northeast, and many weren't happy about it. "It's horrible," said retired gumball-machine technician Don Zimmerman, of Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, using a snowblower to clear the sidewalk along his block. "I thought winter was out of here. ... It's a real kick in the rear." While people mostly heeded dire warnings to stay home and off the roads, police said a 16-year-old girl was killed when she lost control of her car on a snowy road and hit a tree in Gilford, New Hampshire. In East Hartford, Connecticut an elderly man died after being struck by a snow plow truck. The storm closed schools in cities big and small, Amtrak suspended service and the post office halted mail delivery. Philadelphia and New York City got anywhere from a few inches of snow to around half a foot before the storm switched over mostly to sleet; forecasters had predicted a foot or more. In New Jersey, which saw rain or just a little snow in many areas, Gov. Chris Christie called the storm an "underperformer." But officials warned of dangerous ice. Inland areas, meanwhile, got hit hard. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Worcester, Massachusetts, received a foot or more of snow. The Binghamton, New York, area got over 2 feet, while Vernon, New Jersey, had at least 19 inches. The storm came just days after the region saw temperatures climb into the 60s, and less than a week before the official start of spring. February, too, was remarkably warm. "The winters seem to be upside down now. January and February are nice and then March and April seem to be more wintry than they were in the past," said Bob Clifford, who ventured out on an early morning grocery run for his family in Altamont, near Albany, New York. His advice: "Just hide inside. Hibernate." In the nation's capital, non-essential federal employees were given the option of reporting three hours late, taking the day off or working from home. The city got less than 2 inches of snow. A few days ago, workers on Washington's National Mall were making plans to turn on the fountains. "Obviously all that has to come to an abrupt stop until we get all the snow cleared," said Jeff Gowen, the acting facility manager for the National Mall and Memorial Parks. "The cherry blossoms, they're right on the cusp of going into bloom here. I had a feeling this was going to happen." Kelly Erskine, a 28-year-old coffee shop manager from Whitman, Massachusetts, about 25 miles south of Boston, made it almost all the way through the winter without a shovel. She went to Walmart on Tuesday morning to get one. "I live in an apartment complex and they usually take care of the shoveling, but they sent a letter to us and said, 'Expect a lot of snow.' I knew from the letter that I'd have to go out and buy a shovel," she said. As the storm closed in, the National Weather Service used terms like "life-threatening" and urged people to "shelter in place," language that has come to be associated with mass shootings. In the end, the line between snow and rain shifted slightly to the west, sparing some of the Northeast's big cities. Government meteorologists realized by late Monday afternoon that there was a good chance the storm wasn't going to produce the giant big-city snow totals predicted. But they didn't change their forecast for fear people would mistakenly think the storm was no longer dangerous, said Greg Carbin, chief of forecast operations at the Weather Prediction Center. In Pennsylvania, snowplows and state troopers escorted a 23-month-old child in need of a heart transplant 80 miles between hospitals. Gov. Tom Wolf said the youngster made the trip safely. In Narragansett, Rhode Island, high winds buckled a state-owned wind turbine. In New York City, two homes under construction collapsed near the waterfront in Far Rockaway. No injuries were reported. And two ponies broke out of their stables and roamed the snowy streets of Staten Island until an off-duty police officer wrangled them with straps normally used to tow cars and tied them to a lamppost. They were taken back to the stables. "We want to thank our cowboy officer," Mayor Bill de Blasio said. The storm coincided with New Hampshire's Town Meeting Day, a Yankee tradition in which voters in more than 100 communities elect local politicians and set budgets. Some towns postponed because of the snow. But in Hopkinton, a steady stream of voters braved the blustery conditions to make it to the polls. "You know, they're hardy New Englanders, and they're coming to vote," said Debbie Norris, a candidate for the Hopkinton Budget Committee. The flight cancellations included nearly 3,300 in the New York City area alone. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at airports. Laura and Matthew Balderstone of West Yorkshire, England, intended to spend their honeymoon in Florida but found themselves stuck at the Newark, New Jersey, airport and couldn't find a hotel room. "It's better safe than sorry, especially flying. I suppose it's a shame that we can't get another way around this," Matthew Balderstone said. "It's just the way it is, unfortunately." ___ Lavoie reported from Whitman, Massachusetts.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) NEW YORK (AP) — A blustery late-season storm plastered the Northeast with sleet and snow Tuesday, paralyzing much of the Washington-to-Boston corridor after a stretch of unusually mild winter weather that had people thinking spring was already here. The powerful nor'easter fell well short of the predicted snow totals in New York and Philadelphia but unloaded 1 to 2 feet in many places inland, grounded more than 6,000 flights and knocked out power to nearly a quarter-million customers from Virginia northward. By the time it reached Massachusetts, it had turned into a blizzard, with near hurricane-force wind gusting over 70 mph along the coast and waves crashing over the seawalls. Up to a foot of snow was expected in the Boston area. It was easily the biggest storm in a merciful winter that had mostly spared the Northeast, and many weren't happy about it. "It's horrible," said retired gumball-machine technician Don Zimmerman, of Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, using a snowblower to clear the sidewalk along his block. "I thought winter was out of here. ... It's a real kick in the rear." While people mostly heeded dire warnings to stay home and off the roads, police said a 16-year-old girl was killed when she lost control of her car on a snowy road and hit a tree in Gilford, New Hampshire. The storm closed schools in cities big and small, Amtrak suspended service and the post office halted mail delivery. Philadelphia and New York City got anywhere from a few inches of snow to around half a foot before the storm switched over mostly to sleet; forecasters had predicted a foot or more. In New Jersey, which saw rain or just a little snow in many areas, Gov. Chris Christie called the storm an "underperformer." But officials warned of dangerous ice. Inland areas, meanwhile, got hit hard. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Worcester, Massachusetts, received a foot or more of snow. The Binghamton, New York, area got over 2 feet, while Vernon, New Jersey, had at least 19 inches. The storm came just days after the region saw temperatures climb into the 60s, and less than a week before the official start of spring. February, too, was remarkably warm. "The winters seem to be upside down now. January and February are nice and then March and April seem to be more wintry than they were in the past," said Bob Clifford, who ventured out on an early morning grocery run for his family in Altamont, near Albany, New York. His advice: "Just hide inside. Hibernate." In the nation's capital, non-essential federal employees were given the option of reporting three hours late, taking the day off or working from home. The city got less than 2 inches of snow. A few days ago, workers on Washington's National Mall were making plans to turn on the fountains. "Obviously all that has to come to an abrupt stop until we get all the snow cleared," said Jeff Gowen, the acting facility manager for the National Mall and Memorial Parks. "The cherry blossoms, they're right on the cusp of going into bloom here. I had a feeling this was going to happen." Kelly Erskine, a 28-year-old coffee shop manager from Whitman, Massachusetts, about 25 miles south of Boston, made it almost all the way through the winter without a shovel. She went to Walmart on Tuesday morning to get one. "I live in an apartment complex and they usually take care of the shoveling, but they sent a letter to us and said, 'Expect a lot of snow.' I knew from the letter that I'd have to go out and buy a shovel," she said. As the storm closed in, the National Weather Service used terms like "life-threatening" and urged people to "shelter in place," language that has come to be associated with mass shootings. In the end, the line between snow and rain shifted slightly to the west, sparing some of the Northeast's big cities. Government meteorologists realized by late Monday afternoon that there was a good chance the storm wasn't going to produce the giant big-city snow totals predicted. But they didn't change their forecast for fear people would mistakenly think the storm was no longer dangerous, said Greg Carbin, chief of forecast operations at the Weather Prediction Center. In Pennsylvania, snowplows and state troopers escorted a 23-month-old child in need of a heart transplant 80 miles between hospitals. Gov. Tom Wolf said the youngster made the trip safely. In Narragansett, Rhode Island, high winds buckled a state-owned wind turbine. In New York City, two homes under construction collapsed near the waterfront in Far Rockaway. No injuries were reported. And two ponies broke out of their stables and roamed the snowy streets of Staten Island until an off-duty police officer wrangled them with straps normally used to tow cars and tied them to a lamppost. They were taken back to the stables. "We want to thank our cowboy officer," Mayor Bill de Blasio said. The storm coincided with New Hampshire's Town Meeting Day, a Yankee tradition in which voters in more than 100 communities elect local politicians and set budgets. Some towns postponed because of the snow. But in Hopkinton, a steady stream of voters braved the blustery conditions to make it to the polls. "You know, they're hardy New Englanders, and they're coming to vote," said Debbie Norris, a candidate for the Hopkinton Budget Committee. The flight cancellations included nearly 3,300 in the New York City area alone. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at airports. Laura and Matthew Balderstone of West Yorkshire, England, intended to spend their honeymoon in Florida but found themselves stuck at the Newark, New Jersey, airport and couldn't find a hotel room. "It's better safe than sorry, especially flying. I suppose it's a shame that we can't get another way around this," Matthew Balderstone said. "It's just the way it is, unfortunately." ___ Lavoie reported from Whitman, Massachusetts.

Today, things are very different for the 'glorified welder', 47. Gone is the LA home – swapped for a $2 million mansion in Texas – while the Long Beach garage that propelled him to fame is a thing of the past. Now happily remarried to wife number four, drag racer and heiress Alexis DeJoria, 39, James has thrown himself into a panoply of new ventures, including a gun manufacturing business and a National Rifle Association clothing range. West Coast Choppers still powers on, albeit largely in the form of clothing, and James says his $25,000 apiece guns are now his main focus – among them the weapon he is making as a gift for President Trump. In exclusive interview with DailyMail.com, Jesse James says he is in a good place with wife number four, Alexis DeJoria, and his new business ventures - a gun manufacturing company and a National Rifle Association clothing line  Speaking exclusively to DailyMail.com, he said: 'I'm just not sure how I'm going to get it to him. I asked his people and they don't know either. They only just started this stuff so I guess they're still getting things figured out.' Along with weapons, James' passions include his motorbike – a hot rod customized to look like a New Orleans Police Department chopper, complete with a siren – and his family. His two eldest children, from his marriage to first wife Karla James, live close to his Dripping Springs, Texas, home: son Eli, 19, lives in Austin where he plays in two bands and has 'a passion for music' according to his proud father. Meanwhile his daughter Chandler, 22, is getting back on track following well-publicized drug problems that saw her enter rehab in 2013 and is a committed 'PETA vegetarian'. Ex-wife Bullock, 52, also keeps a house in the area, as does Janine Lindemulder, 48, the porn star mother of his youngest daughter Sunny, 13. Seven years ago, the West Coast Choppers founder endured the worst time of his life following revelations he cheated on his then-wife Sandra Bullock He remarried drag racer and billionaire heiress Alexis DeJoria, 39, in March 2013. Of their relationship he said: 'We like the same stuff, the same music, the same everything. It makes me look back at other relationships and be like, I was an idiot! What was I thinking?' James, 47, was married three times before, including to porn star Janine Lindemulder. The pair had an acrimonious divorce and vicious custody battle over their daughter, Sunny  He has no contact with Bullock now – nor the son, Louis, they were in the process of adopting at the time of their divorce – but he says he does not regret a thing and is happy with how life turned out. James married Alexis DeJoria in 2013. She is the daughter of billionaire entrepreneur John Paul DeJoria, co-founder of the Paul Mitchell hair care products line and Patron Spirits Company. Speaking about her, he said: 'It's just a different deal this time and it just happened. 'I was like, I'm just going to be that old dude who's single now and never find anybody else, and then it's like – there she is. 'We like the same stuff, the same music, the same everything. We like all these things. It makes me look back at other relationships and be like, I was an idiot! What was I thinking? That was never going to work. But I guess that's how you learn, you know.'  He added: 'The first one [Karla] doesn't count because I was 20 when I got with her and she was 30. Isn't that kind of bad? 'Like my daughter's 22 right now and I imagine if some 30-year-old dude came round, I'd be like no, no, no. James is now working on new business ventures, including manufacturing $25,000 guns The 'glorified welder' says he is in the process of making a gun as a gift for President Trump. He said: ': 'I'm just not sure how I'm going to get it to him. I asked his people and they don't know either. They only just started this stuff so I guess they're still getting things figured out' The TV star swapped his LA home for a $2 million Austin, Texas property shortly after his split from Sandra Bullock James said:  'I always felt more relaxed in Austin [during his marriage to Bullock], so I opened a shop, started doing projects here and it got more and more' Along with weapons, James' passions include working on his motorbikes in his Texas garage Jesse and wife Alexis after she won the Carquest Auto Parts event in Chandler, Arizona, America  in 2014 'That was kind of scandalous. No ill will but by the time I was 30 and she was 40, we had nothing, nothing in common.' James was born in Long Beach, California, to a working class family and made his first foray into business in 1989 from his mother's garage. That business, West Coast Choppers, would go on to become a multi-million dollar enterprise – given a boost via a reality TV show named Monster Garage that made its debut in June 2002. From there, James expanded into further TV work – appearing in the Discovery Channel's Sons of Guns, Jesse James is a Dead Man, American Chopper and, most recently, Jesse James: Outlaw Garage. West Coast Choppers, originally a business specializing in custom motorcycle parts and complete bikes, expanded into clothing and accessories – most featuring a logo resembling the Maltese Cross. For a decade, the brand was sold through the 5,000 US branches of Walmart – as well as internationally, in countries ranging from the U.K. to China. But James' business – and his personal reputation – came crashing down in March 2010 after several women came forward claiming to having had affairs with the 47-year-old. At the time, James was married to his third wife, actress Sandra Bullock, whom he married in 2005, after meeting her during a tour of the Monster Garage set. Prior to that, he had been married to Karla James, 57, between 1991 and 2002 with whom he had two children, and porn actress Janine Lindemulder, 48. Lindemulder, whose main claim to fame is her appearance on the cover of Blink 182's 1999 album Enema of the State, was his wife between 2002 and 2004. On his ex-wife Sandra Bullock, James says a lot of good came out of the marriage and he has 'no regrets' except about the loss of 'his son' Louis. Bullock and James started the process of adopting Louis before their divorce but she finalized the adoption alone  A year before his marriage to Bullock ended, Lindemulder was the cause of another scandal – igniting a custody battle over James' youngest daughter Sunny following her release from prison in October 2009 on tax evasion charges. At the time, Bullock stood by her husband but all that changed after it emerged that he had cheated on her with tattooed model Michelle 'Bombshell' McGee. Two other women, stripper Melissa Smith and Los Angeles photographer Brigitte Daguerre also came forward claiming to have had affairs with James. In April 2010, he checked himself into a rehab facility in Arizona after apologizing profusely to Bullock, although that wasn't enough to save the marriage – they divorced the following June. James told DailyMail.com: 'Yeah, I did cheat on my wife, yeah, I stood up and took accountability for it and apologized. And that's end of story. Everything else was just… [shakes his head]'. The 47-year-old, who is still targeted on social media over the affair, added: 'The easy [put down] is like, oh well you cheated on Sandra Bullock. That's the world's easiest comeback. 'In general, both women and men cheat. It's part of life.' He continued: 'It's like people love to see you fall. And the farther you get, the higher you get, the more they love it. 'I look at myself now and I look at how I was feeling then, and I think I was completely overreacting as far as letting it really get to me. 'I think it was having 50 or 60 or paparazzi outside my house for five or six months… That was not a good feeling. I'm a fighter man, I come from the tradition of – if you do something I don't like, I'm going to punch you. 'There's no lawsuits, nothing – we're just going to fight it out. It's hard for me to bite my cheeks and not say anything and just look down. 'You learn what's important – that that whole fame thing is not really…. It's meaningless when your quality of life goes to zero.' Despite finding the going tough, James now says 'a lot of good' came out of the end of his marriage – including his move to Austin, Texas, shortly after his divorce from Bullock. He said: 'I always felt more relaxed here [during his marriage to Bullock], so I opened a shop, started doing projects here and it got more and more. 'Finally, in 2010, I was like, I'm out of here [Los Angeles]. I got sick of LA, I went through a bunch of BS – I thought, it's time to go, get a better life for my kids, you know. James was one of the first celebrities to endorse Donald Trump, whom he met while filming Celebrity Apprentice in 2009, he has been outspoken in his support for the president 'A lot of good happened out of [the end of his marriage] because it helped me focus on being a dad more, it helped me focus on doing the right thing and being myself, and getting out of LA and getting a better life for my kids.' Nonetheless, James, who remains at the helm of West Coast Choppers as well as Jesse James Firearms Unlimited, Texas Hot Rods and, most recently, NRA Originals, isn't shy about putting his head above the parapet. One of the first celebrities to endorse Donald Trump, whom he met while filming Celebrity Apprentice in 2009, he has been outspoken in his support for the president. He said: 'I know he's working hard and he's doing a lot of stuff – like the thing he signed for equality for women. 'We don't even know about it and you know why? Because no one does any press on it. They're all like, oh he hates women. I think he's doing good.' Speaking about the President's recent visit to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, James added: 'I thought, even if he's not my friend or nothing, it's kind of bad a** we have a president who can take someone and entertain and probably get that guy to pay more for us to defend them – that's how it's done. 'That's how they do sales meetings – they say let's go out for dinner and they'll get the buyer to pay more and that's how it's done. I don't know if Obama was cut out for that.' James, who voted for Obama in 2008, says he was left disappointed by the former president, while Hillary Clinton he dismisses as a person 'who only cares about herself'. On Liberals such as Amy Schumer who continue to protest the Trump administration, James is cutting. '[Schumer] is not funny. Even her skits and all the things like that. I don't care about her personal views but I don't think she's that funny. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Cops illegally searched the home of Sandra Bullock's stalker... Wedding bells?

On Schumer's anti-gun stance, he added: 'It's all bulls*** because if she came here and hung out for a day and learned to shoot, she would love it. 'It's all, even the anti-Trump stuff, it's a little bit a grab at fame. If I tell everybody what an asshole Trump is and how I hate him, then I'll be on CNN or CNBC. They're all getting a bump in fame by slamming him.' Although James says he hopes that people will come around to Trump and unite behind the flag, for himself, the focus is now on the recently launched NRA Originals and his Jesse James Firearms Unlimited brands. But for all the politicking he does on Twitter and other social media outlets, he says he is not interested in making the move to Washington DC himself and wants to carry on with what he does best – welding and creating choppers and firearms. He said: 'I'm just a welder. A glorified welder. That's really what my core is. Everything else is just like frosting. How I weld today, that's what really means the most.'

just-style home News & insights News US Q4 in brief – Cato Corp, DSW , Bon Ton, Tilly's, Genesco By Michelle Russell and Beth Wright | 16 March 2017 Font size Email Print In the most recent fourth-quarter filings from US apparel and footwear brands and retailers, Abercrombie & Fitch booked results that missed expectations, while The Children's Place achieved what it said was a "spectacular" year. VF Corporation, meanwhile, revealed a fall in both sales and earnings for the quarter, while Stein Mart moved to a loss as a result of "aggressive" promotions.  Cato Corp Cato Corp reported a net loss of US$12.8m for the fourth quarter, compared to net income of $11.8m in the year-ago period. Fourth-quarter gross margin decreased to 28.8% of sales from 36.1% of sales in 2015, primarily due to reduced merchandise margins and higher occupancy costs. Sales for the period were $218.2m, a decrease of 12% on last year's $247.3m. Same-store sales were also down 12% for the quarter. CEO John Cato said 2016 was a "very disappointing year" for the company. He added: "The overall apparel retail environment continued to be difficult and was compounded by several mistakes of our own.  We also are being impacted by the disruption caused by the growth of online sales at other retailers, resulting in lower store traffic.  In the back half of the year, we made several mistakes in our merchandise assortment, fit and timing.  This resulted in significant reductions to regular priced sales causing us to liquidate a large portion of our slow selling inventory which put severe pressure on earnings." DSW DSW said its return to year over year earnings growth continued in the fourth quarter, with net income rising 158.5% to US$30.5m, compared to $11.8m in the year-ago period.

Net income meanwhile, slipped 12.2% to $64m from $72.9m in the year-ago period. For the full year, total company net sales increased to $3.5bn or 3% over the prior year. Comparable sales increased 1%. Net income fell 2.9% to $218m, versus $224.5bn last year.

The Dow fluctuated wildly today, at one point being down nearly 350 points before closing almost 200 points down. U.S. stocks traded lower Tuesday as oil prices continued to fall and traders looked ahead to a likely interest rate hike on Wednesday. U.S. crude oil prices gave up earlier gains to hit a fresh three-month low after a monthly OPEC report said oil inventories had continued to rise despite the start of a global deal to cut supply.

Treasury yields traded slightly lower, while the U.S. dollar index held slightly higher. "It's really monetary policy and the timing and complexity of U.S. legislation" that are in focus for markets this week, said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. He added that trade volume would likely be light given a snowstorm in the greater New York area. The Federal Open Market Committee is set to begin its two-day meeting Tuesday and is expected to raise rates. Traders will be watching for indications on how many more rate hikes to expect this year. Late Monday, the Congressional Budget Office said it estimated 14 million more people would become uninsured next year if the American Health Care Act is signed into law. "The CBO review of the Obamacare repeal and replace [is] just adding to uncertainty about the timing of any legislation," Boockvar said. "If that gets delayed, then tax reform gets delayed." In economic news, the Producer Price Index (PPI) rose 0.3 percent last month. In the 12 months through February, the PPI jumped 2.2 percent, the biggest advance since March 2012 and ahead of the 2.0 percent gain forecast in the Reuters poll. Earlier on Tuesday, the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) said its small business optimism index fell 0.6 points to 105.3 last month. Overseas, the STOXX Europe 600 declined 0.4 percent in morning trade ET. The Shanghai composite eked out a roughly 2-point gain, while the Nikkei 225 fell 0.12 percent. In morning trade, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 43 points, or 0.21 percent, to 20,836. Caterpillar had the greatest negative impact, while Wal-Mart was one of the top contributors to gains. The S&P 500 fell 8 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,365, with energy leading all sectors lower. The Nasdaq composite declined 19 points, or 0.33 percent, to 5,855. The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX), considered the best gauge of fear in the market, climbed to near 11.9. About five stocks declined for every advancer on the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 47 million and a composite volume of 123 million in morning trade.

By Kristin M. Kraemer Tri-City Herald Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS A Pasco man’s case for threatening to kill his ex-wife was dismissed after investigators found evidence that she sent the text messages to herself. The attorney for Paul M. Gillum said even though the criminal charges were dropped in Benton County Superior Court, his client did not get justice. “It worked out in the end for him, but what happened to him was not fair in any way shape or form,” lawyer Kevin Holt told the Tri-City Herald. “It was devastating to my client. It almost cost him his job. He went to jail. It cost him his reputation in the community. We’re just thankful that occasionally liars get caught.” Gillum’s ex-wife, Christine Gillum, has not been charged. But Deputy Prosecutor Anita Petra said the woman is being investigated, though she would not say what type of charges the woman could face. Christine Gillum did several things during the case that raised red flags for Benton County sheriff’s deputies and Richland police, Petra said. As a result, they followed their instincts and discovered a store surveillance video showing her buying a throwaway phone that ultimately was linked to the threatening text messages, Petra said. “The state firmly believed, and still believes, that there was probable cause in this matter (against Paul Gillum) with the evidence that was available to them at the time” the charges were filed, Petra said Monday. “As of now, the state believes it would be very difficult to prove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt because of the credibility issues involving Ms. Gillum.” Paul Gillum, 45, had been charged with second-degree rape, second-degree assault with domestic violence and felony harassment with domestic violence. Holt described the probable cause affidavit filed against his client in November as scathing. He acknowledged that prosecutors may have been justified in charging Gillum based on the initial evidence, but added that law enforcement didn’t want to believe Gillum or do any more investigating on the case until the defense persisted. Gillum works for a Tri-City towing company and was in the Army for more than two decades, said Holt, who took the case for free. Holt said while charging Christine Gillum may have a chilling effect on sexual assault or abuse victims who are often anxious about coming forward, she should not get away with it if investigators have evidence that she made up serious allegations against her ex. In the meantime, the attorney will try to get all civil protection orders removed so Paul Gillum can see his kids. He said they’re also considering filing a lawsuit against Christine Gillum. Christine Gillum first contacted deputies on Nov. 11, alleging her ex had sexually assaulted her twice, beat and choked her and sent obscenity-laced messages about plans to squeeze the life out of her and being in control. The messages also mentioned previous alleged attacks. She had bruising on her body that prosecutors said was consistent with the allegations, and she got physically ill while describing the abuse for investigators. She said she had moved out of her home so her ex could not find her. In a follow-up interview, investigators asked for her phone to preserve the text messages. Gillum said she would bring it to the sheriff’s office, but didn’t come in until four days later after being called repeatedly, Petra wrote in the dismissal order. Paul Gillum initially was locked up on $250,000 bail. It was reduced to $100,000 and he was freed from custody after his father helped post bond. But he was back behind bars days later when his ex-wife reported Gillum had sent her new text messages and left voicemails. Petra wrote that based on the content of the messages, it appeared they were from Gillum, even though they were coming from a different number than before. However, Petra said it soon was clear that “things just weren’t lining up,” and it became a joint investigation with Richland and Benton County doing “good old-fashioned police work.” She released Gillum during the 72-hour-hold period and opted not to file an additional harassment charge. Officers connected the most recent phone number to a T-Mobile Alcatel brand burner phone with no registered owner. It was activated Nov. 28 – the same day Christine Gillum alleged her ex started harassing her again, and just a half hour after she bought the same type of phone and a $40 prepaid card at Walmart, the dismissal order said. Surveillance footage allegedly shows her buying those items with cash, then going back into the store to pick up other goods with her debit card. Officers got a copy of the receipt which shows the phone’s identifying serial numbers. Meanwhile, investigators began the forensic examination on Christine Gillum’s phone for the initial messages, and found she had deleted a lot of the content before handing it over, the court document said. Police recovered a texting application that is capable of sending and receiving messages. Investigators, working with T-Mobile, confirmed the second round of messages came from the number on the phone that she was seen buying. When questioned about a burner phone, she initially denied ever buying a throwaway, then said she bought one for her son but turned over a different phone, the document said. Petra said it took a few months to finally dismiss Paul Gillum’s case because they were waiting for subpoenas with the phone company to verify the evidence. “We had the video, which was extremely incriminating, but we needed to get further documentation just to confirm,” she said. The initial messages, which came from a different number, reportedly have not yet been linked to a person.

Liliana Segura Liliana Segura 2017-03-14T13:00:35+00:00 Photo: Patrick Semansky/AP When Ilene Hurd Smoot’s brother went to prison in 2004, she was angry at him at first. Their parents had strived to raise them right; their father was a deacon at their childhood church in Mississippi and the siblings sang in the choir. “They were hardworking people,” Ilene said. “They didn’t steal. They worked for everything they had.” Her brother, Shannon Hurd, was mischievous growing up, she says, but he had never done anything to hurt anyone. His main problem was a drug addiction he couldn’t seem to shake, which led to a couple of arrests in his 20s. Although she was the baby of the family, Ilene felt protective of her older brother. “I used to say, ‘Shannon, please, whatever you do, just be good.’” But in 2003, Shannon was arrested for walking into a home in Kenner, Louisiana, and stealing $14 from an elderly couple. He insisted police had the wrong man — the couple had not seen his face — but his clothes closely resembled the description of the culprit, and the cops discovered $14 when they found him soon after the robbery. Despite his relatively minor crime, at trial the state cast Shannon as “the worst kind of defendant. He’s a predator.” In a 11-1 split, the jury found him guilty. He was given 30 years in prison. But Jefferson Parish prosecutors weren’t satisfied. On September 10, 2004, according to court records, “the state introduced fingerprint cards, certified copies of convictions, and arrest registers” from Shannon’s previous run-ins with the law. They dated back to the 1990s. One was for unauthorized entry. Another was for “theft over $500.” A third, in 1997, was possession of a firearm by a felon. On December 4, 2004, under Louisiana’s habitual offender law, Shannon was resentenced to life without parole. Ilene was incredulous — “Life for $14? Come on, seriously?” — but she couldn’t help but be mad at her brother. “I kind of like cut off communication with him,” she admitted. For years, Shannon kept writing to her anyway, certain that she would respond eventually. That moment came suddenly, when Ilene opened a letter in April 2014. Shannon was gravely ill. He had long complained about a pain in his side, but prison doctors dismissed the symptoms. By the time he was diagnosed with kidney cancer, the tumors had spread to his brain. “Please don’t think I’m playing games with y’all,” Shannon wrote in his letter to his sister. “I’m sick and I don’t want to die alone.” The Hurd family. Photo: Hurd Family Ilene immediately got back in touch with her brother, going to see him at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, known as Angola. As he deteriorated, advocates helped him apply for medical parole or compassionate release, but officials rejected the request, citing behavior violations during Shannon’s time in the prison hospice. In a letter last summer to Louisiana Department of Corrections Secretary James LeBlanc, Catholic nun and prison activist Alison McCrary called it “wildly inappropriate” to subject Shannon to disciplinary measures. “Mr. Hurd is a dying man with multiple brain tumors taking steroid medication, all of which means that his control over his behavior is diminished for reasons he has no control over,” she wrote, to no avail. On Sunday, March 5, at age 42, Shannon died at Angola. Ilene was by his side, along with her older sister. Ilene’s 20-year-old daughter made the drive too, but was barred from seeing him despite being on his visiting list. (“They’re like, he didn’t put her on this list.”) Prison officials wanted to bury Shannon quickly, on Tuesday, but he had repeatedly begged them not to leave his body at Angola. Bringing his body home was an expense the siblings could hardly afford, a reality for many families. It is one major reason half of the men who die at Angola are buried there. Still, Ilene was determined to try. The day after her brother’s death, the family put up a crowdfunding webpage seeking money to cover the transportation and funeral expenses. “Shannon was well loved by all, and he was never thrown away,” Ilene wrote. “He was our brother — not just another inmate — and we want to remember him as such.” Men incarcerated at the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, La., attend a screening in 2011 of the documentary “Serving Life,” about the volunteer hospice work done by inmates for inmates dying in the prison. Photo: Gerald Herbert/AP Cruel and All Too Usual The case of Shannon Hurd may seem uniquely cruel, but it is not unusual. In 2015, Glenn Ford died from untreated lung cancer after spending decades on Louisiana’s death row for a crime he did not commit. Scores of other men and women are growing old in state and federal prison for nonviolent crimes, with little hope of release. Barack Obama granted clemency to a historic 1,927 people serving draconian sentences during his presidency, but denied many thousands more. In 2013, the American Civil Liberties Union published a major report on the thousands serving life without parole for nonviolent crimes at the state level. Louisiana easily outpaced all other states, with a tally of 429. Florida was a distant second, with 270. Behind the figure was the same habitual offender law that sent Hurd to die in prison. As I wrote in The Nation in 2013, the report highlighted men like Fate Vincent Winslow, “who, while homeless, ‘acted as a go-between in the sale of two small bags of marijuana, worth $10 in total, to an undercover police officer’; Timothy Jackson, who stole a jacket from a department store in New Orleans; Paul Carter, convicted of ‘possession of a trace amount of heroin residue that was so minute it could not be weighed’; and Sylvester Mead, a Shreveport man who drunkenly threatened a police officer while seated, handcuffed, in the back of a patrol car.” In another case out of Jefferson Parish, a man named Keith Barnes stole items valued at $188.22 from a Walmart and was given a two-year sentence — the maximum for such a low-level offense. But, as with Shannon Hurd, prosecutors argued that Barnes was a repeat offender. It did not matter than he had already served serious prison time for earlier offenses, including 16 years for an armed robbery he committed as a teenager. At 39 years old, Barnes too was resentenced to life without parole. Like Shannon — and like some 90 percent of those serving life without parole for nonviolent crimes in Louisiana — all the aforementioned men are black. “Dogs get treated better than black people here,” Ilene says. At Angola, a functioning plantation named for the origins of the slaves who once worked the same land, abysmal medical care accelerates the in-house death sentences given to men like her brother. The prison runs on inmate labor; in a six-month investigation by reporters Katie Rose Quandt and James Ridgeway last year, a man named Francis Brauner argued that the prison denies treatment to those no longer seen as useful. “You get hurt, you get sick, or you can’t produce for them no more in their fields. … They put you on a ward on a bed and let you die,” he said. Brauner, who arrived at Angola in 2010 after becoming paralyzed in an accident at a different Louisiana facility, spent years surreptitiously documenting the prison’s repeated failure to provide him medical treatment. Quandt and Ridgeway recounted how the records became the basis for a class-action lawsuit in 2015. The 63-page suit is rife with horrific details describing gross medical neglect at Angola, from untreated wounds to refusals to provide a cane to a man who lost his eyesight. Guards and EMTs accuse injured men of “malingering” in order to get out of physical labor. Cancer screenings are virtually nonexistent. Among the plaintiffs in the lawsuit is Shannon Hurd, who had begun complaining about a pain in his side the same year Brauner began keeping his notes. In the years that followed, Quandt and Ridgeway wrote, Shannon “developed numbness in his feet, legs, and fingertips, lost his appetite, and dropped nearly 100 pounds. When he finally received a CT scan in 2015, he was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in his kidneys and lungs.” Ilene remembers her brother telling her repeatedly, “They are killing me in here.” The sun shines through concertina wire on a fence at the Angola Prison Rodeo in Angola, La., April 26, 2014. Photo: Gerald Herbert/AP Free at Last On March 10, the Friday after her brother’s death, Ilene was at her sister’s place across from the New Orleans airport, listening to the radio and cooking up a storm. Her aunt had gotten up early that morning to prepare potato salad and green salad; her sister had made macaroni and cheese. There was catfish in a propane fryer outside. The family had handed out fliers around the neighborhood advertising a two-day fundraiser, with a few lines about her brother printed along the bottom. “Please help bring some peace to Shannon in his final resting,” it read. For $9 on Friday you got a full plate including peas, bread, and a slice of cake. Chicken plates would be available Saturday for $8 apiece. Some people had already come by just to give donations. “Like yesterday a lady just came by and gave me ten dollars,” Ilene said. “She was like, ‘I don’t want a plate. Here, take the ten dollars.’” The crowdfunding site had raised more than $2,000 so far, but that was far from the $7,000 goal. Ilene knows too well how much a funeral costs: Her mother died of a sudden heart attack in 1995 and her 23-year-old brother, Daryl, drowned while fishing in Port Fouchon, Louisiana, a year later. In 1998 her father died, too. Like his wife, he was in his 50s. “This isn’t our first rodeo,” Ilene said. They would sell as many plates as possible. There was a lot more to do. Over the weekend she would drive to Mississippi to arrange for the burial plot. But for now Ilene and her remaining siblings were debating how to dress Shannon for his funeral. Ilene was planning to find a nice suit at Goodwill and get it dry-cleaned, but her sister pointed out that he never dressed formally. “I think we might go with something casual,” she said. When her parents and brother died, the family organized both a wake and a funeral, but it got to be too much. Regardless of how much money they raise, Ilene is planning something simple but beautiful, a single event to commemorate her brother. There will be a church service in Kenner on Saturday, March 18. And then they will make the hour and a half drive to Liberty, Mississippi, to lay him to rest alongside his parents and brother. “I want to call it a home-going celebration,” Ilene said. “I don’t want to call it a funeral. Because he’s free.” Top photo: The Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, La., in 2011.

The 2014 study has 603 pages, 258 tables and figures. Worldwide markets are poised to achieve significant growth as the Stationary Fuel Cells used to provide distributed power for campus environments achieve better technology and economies of scale. They have achieved grid parity in many cases. They improve and lower energy costs. They threaten to erode utility profitability. Browse Full Report Visit – http://www.acutemarketreports.com/report/stationary-fuel-cells-market Stationary Fuel Cells are on the cusp of becoming commercially viable, creating companies that are profitable and produce electricity at or below parity with the grid giving every user alternatives to the grid. Bloom Energy has solved the SOFC engineering challenges. Breakthroughs in materials science, and revolutionary designs give Bloom SOFC technology a cost effective, all-electric solution. Vendors have solved the SOFC conundrum, developing new materials that make units affordable and provide energy device economies of scale and support for wind and solar renewable energy sources. Stationary fuel cells represent the base for distributed power generation worldwide. No more new coal plants, no mare extensions to the grid. Distributed power has become mainstream. Distributed generation (DG) refers to power generation at the point of consumption. Generating power on-site, rather than centrally, eliminates the cost, complexity, interdependencies, and inefficiencies associated with energy transmission and distribution. Distributed energy is evolving in a manner like distributed PC and laptop computing, cars for transportation, and smart phones. As distributed Internet data and telephony have found a place in the market, so also will distributed energy generation become widespread. Distributed power shifts energy generation control to the consumer much to the consternation of the existing utility companies. Renewable energy is intermittent and needs stationary fuel cells for renewables to achieve mainstream adoption as a stable power source. Wind and solar power cannot be stored except by using the energy derived from these sources to make hydrogen that can be stored. Stationary fuel cells are likely to function as a battery in the long term, creating a way to use hydrogen that is manufactured from the renewable energy sources. It is likely that the wind and tide energy will be transported as electricity to a location where the hydrogen can be manufactured. It is far easier to transport electricity than to transport hydrogen. Hydrogen servers as an energy storage mechanism.

As government funding shifts from huge military obligations, sustainable energy policy becomes a compelling investment model for government. Stationary fuel cell markets at $1.2 billion in 2013 are projected to increase to $14.3 billion in 2020. Growth is anticipated to be based on demand for distributed power generation that uses natural gas. Systems provide clean energy that is good for the environment. Growth is based on global demand and will shift from simple growth to rapid growth measured as a penetration analysis as markets move beyond the early adopter stage. The big box retailers including many, led by Walmart, the data centers, and companies like Verizon are early adopters. Eventually hydrogen will be used as fuel in the same stationary fuel cell devices. The hydrogen is manufactured from solar farms. Stationary fuel cells have become more feasible as the industry is able to move beyond platinum catalysts.

(TWNK) Stock Will Keep on Shining in 2017 Hostess Brands' Q4 earnings report should drive TWNK stock even higher By Vince Martin, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Mar 14, 2017, 7:00 am EDT     View All   Popular Posts: 7 High-Yield Dividend Stocks That Are Actually Safe Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock Could Be More Trouble Than You Think 7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Lows in 2017 Recent Posts: Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE) Stock Soars on Earnings Beat Sell the Bounce In Sears Holding Corp (SHLD) Stock Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Holders Might Have a Painful Wait View All Posts On Tuesday, Hostess Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWNK) holds what might be considered its first ‘real’ earnings release. The company did release third-quarter results back in November, but in a quiet press release, with no conference call. On Tuesday, however, investors will get the first clean look at the new Hostess Brands, complete with post-earnings commentary. And that should be a good thing for TWNK stock. To be sure, shares have gone on a torrid run, after the merger with Gores Holdings. But there should be more upside. TWNK stock’s valuation is higher than it was a couple of months ago, but it still trades at a discount to its snack food peers. Furthermore, Hostess Brands’ growth figures in Q3 were very impressive, and there’s little reason to see a deceleration, at least not yet. It’s true that TWNK went bankrupt twice in the last twelve years. But this is a different Hostess Brands, and a different TWNK stock. The more investors that hear the Hostess Brands earnings story, the better TWNK stock will perform. A Lot of Optimism Toward TWNK Stock Hostess stock has gone pretty much straight up before and after its merger with Gores Holdings. In fact, TWNK is up nearly 23% in 2017 alone, and it has almost doubled since July. Even in a bull market, that’s a huge amount of appreciation. But there’s a major reason the performance has been rather impressive. In Q3, for instance, Adjusted EBITDA increased 37% year-over-year, on an impressive 24% increase in revenue. Deep Fried Twinkies — sold only at Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) — have been a huge hit and Twinkies ice cream — a partnership with Nestle SA (ADR) (OTCMKTS:NSRGY) — could drive upside to 2017 results. Purely from a near-term trading perspective, it’s difficult to see TWNK stock getting tripped up by the Q4 results. Performance has been good for several quarters, and seems unlikely to reverse. Expectations likely aren’t that high, particularly with a dearth of Wall Street sell-side coverage. In fact, there’s a decent level of short interest in the stock — about 6.5% — that could provide a bit of a “short squeeze” if investors like the report. So while there is a long-term argument that Hostess Brands stock will be pressured, the Q4 report hardly seems like a downside catalyst. Hostess Brands: Cheaper and Growing Faster Than Its Peers The two knee-jerk reactions toward TWNK stock from a bearish standpoint are rather simple to understand. First, the company has gone bankrupt twice in twelve years. Secondly, Twinkies, Ho Ho’s and other “junk food” hardly seem like a growth market in an environment where consumers are paying closer attention to what they (and their children) eat. As far as the first argument goes, Hostess stock has gone to zero — twice. But the third time may be the charm. The company has completely changed its cost structure, most notably by exiting union contracts through the bankruptcy process. Not only has the cost structure changed, but it’s one of the best in the food business. TWNK’s EBITDA margins of ~29% over the last four quarters are well above majors like Hershey Co (NYSE:HSY) and Mondelez International Inc (NASDAQ:MDLZ). In fact, they are nearly twice those of J & J Snack Foods Corp (NASDAQ:JJSF).

just-style home News & insights News US Q4 in brief – Cato Corp, DSW , Bon Ton, Tilly's, Genesco By Michelle Russell and Beth Wright | 16 March 2017 Font size Email Print In the most recent fourth-quarter filings from US apparel and footwear brands and retailers, Abercrombie & Fitch booked results that missed expectations, while The Children's Place achieved what it said was a "spectacular" year. VF Corporation, meanwhile, revealed a fall in both sales and earnings for the quarter, while Stein Mart moved to a loss as a result of "aggressive" promotions.  Cato Corp Cato Corp reported a net loss of US$12.8m for the fourth quarter, compared to net income of $11.8m in the year-ago period. Fourth-quarter gross margin decreased to 28.8% of sales from 36.1% of sales in 2015, primarily due to reduced merchandise margins and higher occupancy costs. Sales for the period were $218.2m, a decrease of 12% on last year's $247.3m. Same-store sales were also down 12% for the quarter. CEO John Cato said 2016 was a "very disappointing year" for the company. He added: "The overall apparel retail environment continued to be difficult and was compounded by several mistakes of our own.  We also are being impacted by the disruption caused by the growth of online sales at other retailers, resulting in lower store traffic.  In the back half of the year, we made several mistakes in our merchandise assortment, fit and timing.  This resulted in significant reductions to regular priced sales causing us to liquidate a large portion of our slow selling inventory which put severe pressure on earnings." DSW DSW said its return to year over year earnings growth continued in the fourth quarter, with net income rising 158.5% to US$30.5m, compared to $11.8m in the year-ago period. Gross profit increased by 50 bps, while total sales edged up slightly, increasing 0.4% to  $674.6m. Comparable sales meanwhile, decreased 7% compared to last year's 0.7% increase. CEO Roger Rawlins, said: "After making fundamental changes to our core business last year, we are laser focused on driving comp growth through our merchandise and allocation initiatives and the elevation of our customer's digital experience." The Bon-Ton Stores US department store retailer The Bon-Ton Stores saw earnings and revenue decline in the fourth quarter. The York, Pennsylvania-based company recorded net income of US$44.7m, down from $50.6m in the year-ago period. Gross margin increased 145 basis points to 36.2% compared to last year, primarily due to reduced markdowns and lower distribution costs, partially offset by deleverage from lower sales volume. Total sales in the period decreased 5.5% to $877.3m, versus $927.9m last year, while comparable store sales decreased 4.7% as compared with the prior year period. Tilly's  Apparel, footwear and accessories retailer Tilly's says it is encouraged by its fourth-quarter results as earnings reached US$6.3m from $2.9m a year earlier. Gross margin dropped to 30.6% from 31.4% last year, primarily due to a 60 basis point decline in product margins from increased markdowns and a 20 basis point increase in buying, distribution and occupancy costs. Total sales edged up 0.7% to $160.2m, while comparable sales were up 0.1%. CEO, Ed Thomas, said: "While we are encouraged by these results, we will continue to seek ways to improve profitability and continue our progress during fiscal 2017." Genesco Genesco booked declines in both earnings and revenue during the fourth quarter. Net earnings reached US$46.5m compared to earnings of $44.7m in the year-ago period. Net sales dropped 5% to $883m from $932m, reflecting the sale of the Lids Team Sports business in the fourth quarter of last year and a decrease of approximately 2% in sales from the remaining businesses. Comparable sales, including same store sales and comparable e-commerce and catalogue sales were flat  with an 8% increase in the Lids Sports Group, a 6% decrease in the Journeys Group, a 2% increase in the Schuh Group, and a 1% decrease in the Johnston & Murphy Group.  Citi Trends  US value fashion retailer Citi Trends posted profit and sales increases in its fourth-quarter. For the 13 weeks ended 28 January, net income increased 60% to US$5.6m, compared to $3.5m in the year-ago period. Sales were also up, increasing 5.4% to $185.5m from $176.1m last year, while comparable sales grew 3.4%.  The Buckle The Buckle booked a drop in both earnings and sales in the fourth quarter, with the former dropping to US$36m from $54.3m a year earlier. Revenues were down 15.7% to $280m from net sales of $332m for the year-ago period, while comparable sales fell 16.1%. Online sales were down 8.8% to $32.2m for the 13-week period ended 28 January.  Zumiez  Zumiez said its fourth-quarter earnings performance exceeded expectations,with net income in the period ended 28 January, increasing 38.3% to US$18.2m, compared to $13.1m in the year-ago period. Net sales for the quarter were also up, increasing 8.7% to $263.6m from $242.4m, while comparable sales for the period increased 5.1% compared to a 9.5% decrease last year. Differential Brands Group Differential Brands Group, which owns Robert Graham and Hudson Clothing, moved to a loss in its fourth-quarter. For the period ended 31 December, net loss from continuing operations was US$4.9m, compared to net income from continuing operations of $0.7m for the prior year period. Net sales, meanwhile, were up 108% to $42m from $20.3m in the prior year period, primarily due to the addition of the Hudson Jeans and Swims brands, as well as 3% growth in Robert Graham. Gross margin fell to 51.8% compared to 59.9% last year, reflecting the inclusion of Hudson Jeans, which carries a lower gross margin rate as a wholesale business. Sears Holdings US retail giant Sears Holdings revealed a widening of its net loss in the quarter to US$607m from $580m a year earlier. Gross margin narrowed slightly from 21.8% to 21.3%, primarily attributed to lower margins in the apparel business, and an increase in promotional activities. Net revenues fell to $6.1bn from $7.3bn in the prior year quarter. CEO Edward Lampert, noted: "We delivered significant Adjusted EBITDA improvement in the fourth quarter, reflecting our firm focus on profitability to offset ongoing revenue pressures. Building on this positive momentum, we are taking decisive actions to become a more agile and competitive retailer with a clear path toward profitability." Tailored Brands Tailored Brands, the former Men's Wearhouse, said it has booked a lower than expected fourth-quarter, despite driving its net loss down to US$30.1m, compared to $1.1bn last year. Retail gross margin increased 60 basis points to 39.0%, primarily as a result of "anniversarying" an $11m inventory write-down in last year's fourth-quarter. "Unfortunately, the challenging retail environment resulted in soft traffic across our retail brands, which drove lower than anticipated fourth quarter and full year net sales and gross margins," said CEO Doug Ewert. Express Express said its fourth-quarter earnings were in line with its guidance, despite net income dropping to US$22.8m from $56.1m a year earlier. Merchandise margin declined by 330 basis points, driven by increased promotional activity. Net sales fell 11% to $678.8m from $765.6m, while comparable sales (including e-commerce sales) decreased 13%. CEO David Kornberg, noted:  "Despite ongoing pressures in the retail sector, our fourth quarter earnings were in line with previously issued guidance. As expected, our store performance continued to be impacted by challenging mall traffic and a promotional retail environment. As our industry adapts to changing consumer preferences, we continue to invest in our omni-channel and marketing capabilities to ensure that we capitalize on this evolution."  The Children's Place, Inc The Children's Place has achieved what it says was a "spectacular" year thanks to significant progress on its numerous self-help initiatives. "Our product assortment, supported by a foundation of superior design, sourcing and merchandising capabilities, clearly resonated with our customers," said CEO Jane Elfers. Net income for the quarter almost doubled to US$34.2m from $17.5m a year earlier. Gross margin improved 50 basis points to 36.1% thanks to merchandise margin leverage and a higher Average Unit Retail (AUR). Net sales were up 4.5% to $520.8m on a comparable retail sales increase of 6.9%. For the full year, earnings soared 77% to $102.3m, while net sales were up 3.4% to $1.78bn. Stein Mart, Inc Stein Mart has revealed a "disappointing" fourth-quarter as the company continued to work through higher than desired inventory levels and the impact of changes to marketing, merchandising and promotions implemented during the third quarter. The company moved to a net loss of US$4.9m from earnings $6.3m a year earlier. Gross margin narrowed to 22.8% from 26.8% a year earlier. Total sales were down 2.2% to $385.5m, while comparable store sales dropped 5.5%. CEO Hunt Hawkins, said: "With our new executive leadership now in place, 2017 will be a year of transition as we refine and organise around our strategies. Lessons learned from last year have us keenly focused on changes we need to make to our business to significantly improve management of our inventories and increase sales productivity." Weyco Group, Inc Weyco has booked a mixed fourth-quarter as earnings rose but sales fell. For the three month period, net income amounted to US$8.3m from $8.2m a year earlier. The 2015 figure included a $458,000 earnout payment relating to the company's 2011 acquisition of the BOGS/Rafters brands. Without this, earnings would have been down 9%. Net sales for the quarter were down 6% to $82.1m. Dick's Sporting Goods Omni-channel sporting goods retailer Dick's Sporting Goods said it was pleased with its fourth-quarter, despite booking a mixed period which saw revenues rise but earnings fall. For the 13 weeks to 28 January, net income fell 30% to US$90.2m, compared to $129m in the year-ago period. Net sales increased 10.9% to US$2.5bn, while same-store sales were up 5.3%. Looking ahead, CEO Edward Stack said the company will "continue to be aggressive" and evolve its business.  Black Diamond, Inc. Black Diamond has narrowed its losses in the fourth quarter, to US$1.39bn from $31.7bn a year earlier. Gross margin narrowed to 29.1% from 33.5%, weighed down by foreign currency headwinds. Sales were down 6% to $41.4m, due to unseasonably dry European winter conditions impacting ski product sales and the company's measured approach to scaling back its apparel line. CEO John Walbrecht, said: "While we still faced foreign exchange headwinds and margin constraints due to our manufacturing repatriation, demand for climbing and mountain products remained strong. We also continued to experience growing momentum in our direct-to-consumer and independent global distributor businesses, as both channels continue to grow in the strong double-digits." Sequential Brands Brand management company Sequential Brands narrowed its losses to US$980,000 in the fourth quarter, from $5.7m in the same period last year. Revenue for the three months to 31 December increased 44% to $45.4m, compared to $31.4m in the year-ago period. For the year ending 31 December, 2017, the company is expecting $170m to $175m in revenue. CEO Yehuda Shmidman said: "Looking ahead, despite a challenging macro retail environment, we will remain focused on growing our core business and maximising operating efficiencies, inclusive of new revenue initiatives already underway." Stage Stores Stage Stores moved to a loss in the fourth quarter and revealed a drop in sales. For the quarter ended 28 January, net loss was US$6.8m versus a profit of $21m last year. Net sales fell 9.6% to $454.4m, compared to $502.6m in the year-ago period. Comparable sales were down 8.5%. CEO Michael Glazer, noted: "Our fourth-quarter adjusted earnings reflect continued challenges in our oil impacted and border states, as well as the overall soft retail environment. Weak traffic led to heightened promotional activity and gross margin pressure in the quarter, yet we are pleased to end 2016 with inventory levels that are 6% lower than last year. In addition, our direct-to-consumer business grew at a double digit rate as we enhanced our customers' online experience."   Burlington Stores Burlington Stores saw both earnings and revenue incense in the fourth quarter, booking a 27.1% rise in net income from US$98.8m to $125.6m in the year ago period. Gross margin expanded 80 basis points to 41.8%, driven by improved shortage results. Net sales were up 9.4%, or $144.9m, to $1.7bn from $1.5bn thanks to a 4.6% increase in comparable store sales and $82.1m in sales from new and non-comparable stores. For the full year, the company expects sales to increase in the range of 7.5% to 8.5%, and comparable sales to be up 2% to 3%. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. Abercrombie & Fitch said its fourth-quarter results did not meet expectations, despite 2016 being a year of "significant progress" on each of its strategic priorities. Earnings were down 15.4% to US$48.8m, while gross margin narrowed 90 basis points to 59.3%. Net sales fell 7% to $1.04bn, with comparable sales for the quarter down 5%. The Abercrombie brand saw sales drop 13% to $442.4m, while Hollister sales were down 2% to $594m. Sales in all geographies were also down in the quarter, at 8% to $688.2m in the US, and 5% to $348.2m in international markets. CEO Fran Horowitz, said: "We continued to proactively respond to the evolving retail landscape through our store closure and channel optimisation initiatives. While the environment is likely to remain challenging in 2017, we have a strong balance sheet and continue to aggressively manage costs … to position our business for sustainable growth." Croc's US footwear firm Crocs  booked revenue in-line with guidance at US$187.4m from $208.7m a year earlier. On a constant-currency basis, revenues fell 10.5%. The company reported a net loss of $40.6m, compared to a loss of $70.2m in the year ago period. CEO Gregg Ribatt said: "Our fourth quarter revenues were in line with our expectations while our adjusted gross margin rate improved by approximately 550 basis points versus prior year. This gross margin gain was less than previously anticipated due to currency and channel mix fluctuations and also to certain one-time events, however we are still on track to achieve our medium-term target for gross margins in the low 50% range." Crocs also revealed Ribbatt will step down as CEO but continue in his board role. Andrew Rees, who joined the company in June 2014 as president, will be promoted to president and CEO, effective 1 June. The company will also close aroundd 160 stores by the end of 2018, reducing its total store count from 558 to around 400.  American Eagle Outfitters American Eagle Outfitters booked a decline in both earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter, with net income slipping 33.1% to US$54.6m from $81.7m in the year ago period. Gross margin increased 30 basis points to 35.4%, compared to 35.1% last year. Total revenues decreased 1% to $1.1bn from $1.11bn in the same period last year. Consolidated comparable sales were up slightly, following a 4% increase last year. CEO Jay Schottenstein said: "We've made great progress, yet we have much more opportunity across the marketplace. I'm confident that the strength of our brands and focused priorities will enable us to deliver long-term returns to our shareholders." Ross Stores Ross Stores booked fourth-quarter earnings and sales that beat company expectations. Net profit grew 13.8% to US$300.6m from $264.2m last year, while total sales rose 8% to $3.5bn. Comparable store sales were up 4% versus a 4% gain in the prior year. CEO Barbara Rentler noted: "We are very pleased with our better-than-expected sales and earnings results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year, especially given our strong multi-year comparisons and the highly competitive and promotional holiday season. Our results continued to benefit from our ability to offer customers great values on a wide assortment of gifts and fashions for the family and the home."For the year ending 3 February, 2018, the company has forecast EPS in the range of $3.02 to $3.15, up 7% to 11% from $2.83 in fiscal 2016. Steve Madden US footwear and accessories specialist Steve Madden said it is pleased with the momentum in its core business after delivering what it called "solid" earnings results in the fourth quarter. For the three months ended 31 December, earnings climbed 11.5% to US$28.7m from $25.7m last year. However, the company said overall sales declined "modestly" due primarily to softness in its private label footwear and cold weather accessories businesses. Sales were down 2.3% in the period to $336.4m, compared to $344.3m last year. Gross margin expanded 260 basis points to 38.7% as compared to 36.1%. CEO Edward Rosenfeld said while the company is cautious about the overall environment, it is confident it can drive top and bottom line growth in 2017 and beyond. Target Corp US retail group Target has booked a drop in earnings and sales in its fourth-quarter on the back on soft store traffic declines and what it calls rapidly-changing consumerbehaviour. For the three months ended 28 January, net earnings tumbled 42.7% from US$1.4bn to $817m. Sales dropped 4.3% to $20.7bn from $21.6bn, reflecting a 1.5% decline in comparable sales combined with the removal of pharmacy and clinic sales from this year's results. Digital channel sales however increased, up by 34% and contributing 1.8 percentage points to comparable sales growth. Gross margin narrowed to 26.9%, compared with 27.9% in the year ago period. The retailer said it will reveal a new financial model later today, designed to position Target for long-term, sustainable growth in "this new era in retail".  "Our fourth quarter results reflect the impact of rapidly-changing consumer behaviour, which drove very strong digital growth but unexpected softness in our stores," said Brian Cornell, chairman and CEO of Target. Foot Locker, Inc US footwear retailer Foot Locker has generated what it says is its seventh consecutive year of "meaningful" sales and profit growth as it revealed higher earnings in its fourth-quarter to US$189m from $158m a year earlier. Gross margin improved to 33.7% of sales from 33.6% a year ago, while total sales climbed 5.3% to $2.11bn. Comparable store sales increased 5%. CEO Richard Johnson, said: "Generating our seventh consecutive year of meaningful sales and profit growth is a strong testament to Foot Locker's solid position at the centre of sneaker culture. Due in part to the change in the cadence of income tax refund check distribution, we are facing a challenging retail sales environment as we enter 2017; however, we believe the strategic initiatives we have in place, coupled with our strong vendor relationships, will enable us to deliver another year of record performance." Nordstrom Upscale US fashion retailer Nordstrom has booked fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations, reflecting what it calls "continuous improvements" to its operating model. For the period ended 28 January, net earnings were up 11.7% to US$201m, from $180m in the year ago period. Net sales were also up, rising 2.4% to $4.2bn compared to $4.1bn last year, while comparable sales slipped by 0.9%. Gross margin, meanwhile, improved 112 basis points, reflecting strong inventory execution in addition to reduced competitive markdowns. For the full year, the company reached record sales of $14.5bn, up from $14.1bn last year. Carter's, Inc Carter's has had what it says was a "strong finish to another record year" as it revealed higher sales and earnings in its fourth-quarter. Net income was up 20% to US$87.1m, while operating margin improved 150 basis points to 14.9%. Net sales, meanwhile, grew 7.8% to reach $67.7m, thanks to revenue growth in nearly every business segment. CEO Michael Casey, said: "Our focus on providing the best value and experience in young children's apparel, extending the reach of our brands, and improving profitability enabled us to achieve our 28th consecutive year of sales growth, improve our profit margins, and increase the return of capital to shareholders. We are forecasting good growth in sales and earnings in 2017." Kohl's Department store retailer Kohl's has posted what it says are "weak" sales results for the fourth quarter, driven by declines in brick and mortar traffic. For the three months ended 28 January, net sales dropped 2.8% to US$6.21bn from $6.39bn in the year-ago period. Net profit was also down, falling 15% to $252m, compared to $296 last year. Gross margin was flat at 33.4%. CEO Kevin Mansell, said: "Sales results were weak for the quarter in total, driven by declines in brick and mortar traffic, and offset somewhat by strength in online demand. We saw improvement in merchandise margin, and our team continued to manage inventory and expenses extremely well. In 2017, we will accelerate our focus on becoming the destination for active and wellness with the launch of Under Armour in early March. We will also extend our efforts on improving our speed to market across all of our proprietary brands into all apparel areas and home." L Brands L Brands booked a mixed fourth-quarter as sales climbed but earnings fell, albeit only slightly. For the three months ended 28 January, the owner of Victoria's Secret said net income fell 0.7% to US$631.7m from $636.0m a year ago. Meanwhile, the company reported net sales of $4.5bn, an increase of 2% compared to sales of $4.4bn for the year ago period. Comparable sales were flat for the period. L Brands noted the exit of the swim and apparel categories had a negative impact of 2 percentage points and 4 percentage points to total company and Victoria's Secret comparable sales, respectively. Looking ahead, the company said it expects first-quarter earnings per share to be $0.20 to $0.25, and $3.05 to $3.35 for 2017 full-year earnings. Iconix Brand Group Brand management company Iconix Brand Group booked a loss of approximately US$297.5m in its fourth-quarter, compared to a loss of around $263.0m a year earlier. Licensing sales fell 8% to $87.1m Revenue in the prior year's fourth quarter included approximately $1.3m of licensing revenue from the Badgley Mischka brand, Iconix said, for which there was no comparable revenue this year, due to its sale in the first quarter. The company also made an operating loss of around $385.8m, as compared to a loss of $398.2m in the year ago period. CEO John Haugh said: "2016 was a year of transition for Iconix. Our operating performance was in-line with our guidance. I believe the changes we have made over the past year provide a strong foundation to drive long term growth and shareholder value."  Chico's FAS, Inc Chico's says it is "extremely pleased" with its fourth-quarter results as it moved to a profit thanks to gross margin expansion and execution of its strategic initiatives. Earnings amounted to US$13.5m from a loss of $21.1m a year earlier, while gross margin expanded to 35.5% from 34.4%. Sales, meanwhile, dropped 4.9% to $600.8m as a result of the sale of the firm's Boston Proper direct-to-consumer business last year. Excluding this, sales dropped 2.3%, primarily reflecting a decline in comparable sales of 2.5%, comprised of reduced transaction count and an increase in average dollar sale. TJX Companies TJX Companies revealed an "above-plan" fourth-quarter, booking increases in both sales and earnings. For the 13 weeks ended 28 January, net income grew1.7% to US$678m from $666m in the year ago period. Gross profit margin was down 0.4 percentage points to 28.3%, versus the prior year. Net sales were up 6% to $9.5bn, compared to $9bn last year, while consolidated comparable store sales increased 3%.

We were proud to mark our 40-year milestone as a company and surpass $33bn in sales." Wolverine Worldwide US clothing and footwear business Wolverine Worldwide has reported a net loss of $2.4m in the fourth quarter, compared to earnings of $11.9m last year. For the period ended 31 December, the company booked a drop in sales, with reported revenue falling 2.9% to US$729.6m compared to the year ago period. Reported gross margin widened slightly to 36.6% from 36.2% in the prior year, and 37.7% on a constant currency basis, an increase of 110 basis points versus the prior year. Reported diluted earnings per share were $0.89, compared to $1.20 in year ago period. CEO Blake Krueger said the company is "well positioned going into 2017 to deliver stronger earnings and perform in what we believe will be a consumer and retail environment that we refer to internally as the 'new normal.'"  Dillard's, Inc Dillards has booked a drop in earnings and sales in its fourth-quarter on the back on mall traffic declines from continued retail industry challenges. "In response, we are ramping up our efforts to bring more distinctive brand and service experiences to Dillard's, both in-store and online," said CEO William Dillard. Earnings fell to US$56.9m from $84m a year earlier, while gross margin from retail operations narrowed 73 basis points. Net sales dropped to $1.94bn from $2.07bn last year. Macy's Department store retailer Macy's saw both earnings and sales fall in its fourth-quarter, and said it expects total sales to be down between 3.2%-4.3% in fiscal 2017, reflecting the 66 stores closed in 2016. Net income fell 12.7% to US$475m from $544m in the year ago period. Gross margin widened slightly to 38.8% from 37.4%, while net sales totalled $8.5bn, a drop of 4.5% on last year. Comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis were down 2.1% in the quarter. Macy's also revealed its previously announced CEO transition will take place on 23 March. Jeff Gennette, currently president of Macy's, will assume the CEO role and Terry Lundgren will continue as executive chairman of the company. Walmart, Inc US retail giant Walmart has booked a drop in fourth-quarter earnings, weighed down by a drop in sales in its international division and heavy investment in its both its store and e-commerce operations. Net profit fell 17.9% to US$3.76bn, while total sales edged up 1% to $130.9bn. Comparable sales were up for the tenth consecutive quarter, at 1.8%. Wal-Mart's online sales also accelerated, boosted by its acquisition of Jet.com, with US digital sales jumping 29%. Domestic sales were up 2.8% to $83.7bn, while international sales fell 5.1% to $31bn. Sam's Club sales were up 3% to $14.98bn. "We're moving with speed to become more of a digital enterprise and better serve customers," says CEO Doug McMillon. "We had a very solid fourth-quarter. Our international business is consistently delivering solid sales growth in constant currency, and Sam's Club posted its best comp sales growth of the year." VF Corporation US apparel giant VF Corporation revealed a fall in both sales and earnings for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2016. Net income fell 15% to US$264.3m in the three months to December, from $312.2m the year before. As a result of the sale of its Contemporary Brands businesses, VF's net loss from discontinued operations was $98m in 2016, which also includes the operating results of the businesses, net of tax. Gross margin improved 90 basis points to a record 49.1% on a reported basis, while total revenues were relatively flat at $3.32 from $3.33. Brand revenue at Vans was up 14% and by 4% at Timberland, but fell 8% at The North Face. For fiscal 2017, VF Corp is forecasting revenue to increase at a low single-digit percentage rate. Kate Spade & Co Kate Spade says it is exploring and evaluating "strategic alternatives to further enhance shareholder value" as it revealed higher fourth-quarter earnings and sales. Net earnings reached US$87m in the three months to the end of December from $62m a year earlier. Gross margin, however, narrowed to 59.2% from 60.2%, while net sales were up 9.8% to $471m. Direct-to-consumer comparable sales growth reached 9.3%. For the full year, earnings jumped to $153.6m from $17.1m, while net sales climbed 11.2% to $1.38bn. Rocky Brands Rocky Brands has moved to a loss in both its fourth-quarter and full-year, after incurring non-cash impairment charges. Despite this, CEO Mike Brooks said he is "confident" the changes to the company's operating strategies and leadership team has made it a stronger organisation that will return greater value to its shareholders over the long-term. For the three months ended 31 December, Rocky Brands reported a net loss of US$0.6m from earnings of $1.4m in the year ago period. Excluding charges, the company recorded earnings of $1.3m. Sales, meanwhile, increased 2.6% to $67m. Wholesale sales declined 8.9% to $42.4m, while retail sales edged up to $13.7m from $13.5m. Gross margin dropped 140 basis points to 32.5%.

Levi Strauss & Co Jeans giant Levi Strauss & Co saw net sales increase slightly in the fourth quarter, up 1% to US$1.29bn from $1.28bn in the year-ago period. In the three months ended 27 November, net income slipped to $96m, down 5% from $101m last year. The decline reflected investments associated with the expansion of company-operated stores network and e-commerce, the San Francisco-based company said. Gross margin narrowed to 50.7% from 51.2%. In Europe, net revenues were up 13%, while in both the Americas and Asia net revenues declined 1%. "We are pleased to report our fourth consecutive year of profitable constant currency revenue growth behind the strength of the Levi's brand and our global direct-to-consumer business," said Chip Bergh, president CEO. "Looking ahead, although it remains a very challenging environment, given our diversified portfolio we remain optimistic about our long term prospects for growth." Columbia Sportswear Columbia Sportswear has revealed record four-quarter net sales of US$717.4m, a 3% increase compared with net sales of $699.4m last year. Net income also reached record levels, up 34% to $84.7m from $63.4m in the year ago period. For the full year, Columbia also booked record sales and earnings, with net sales up 2% to $2.38bn and net income reaching $191.9m, a 10% increase on fiscal 2015. For the year ahead, the company expects net sales growth of around 4%, and net income of between $192m and $200m. CEO Tim Boyle said: "We are very proud of our fourth quarter and full year 2016 performance against a challenging backdrop in many of our largest markets. Record net sales, record gross margins, record operating income, expanded operating margin, and record net income reflect our powerful brand portfolio, robust operational platforms and disciplined prioritisation of investments." Skechers  Despite achieving new fourth-quarter and full-year net sales records, footwear maker Skechers saw earnings slip by more than three quarters in the three months ended 31 December.

Urban Outfitters Teen retailer Urban Outfitters has delivered "record" fourth-quarter sales, growing 2% to US$1.03bn. However total comparable sales were flat, but were up 2% at the Urban Outfitters brand and 1.2% at Free People. Comparable sales decreased 2.9% at the Anthropologie Group. The company said comparable sales were driven by strong, double-digit growth in the direct-to-consumer channel, but were offset by lower retail store comparable net sales. Net income meanwhile, slipped 12.2% to $64m from $72.9m in the year-ago period. For the full year, total company net sales increased to $3.5bn or 3% over the prior year.

E-commerce: Is it truly good for trucking? Amazon and others in e-commerce seem to be pursuing cheap freight strategies; that may only continue as online ordering keeps growing. Mar 14, 2017 Sean Kilcarr | Fleet Owner EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 E-commerce is also becoming something of a “destructive force” in the retail sector, which represents a key freight demand market for trucking, according to a new report released last month. (Photo by Sean Kilcarr for Fleet Owner) Related Media Preparing for the snow No freight rate increases forecasted yet for trucking Why Amazon dominates freight world discussions One would think ever-increasing volumes of e-commerce shipments tied to time-sensitive delivery demands would prove a boon to trucking companies in terms of boosting freight rates. However, that may not be the case. John Larkin, managing director and head of transportation capital markets research for Stifel Capital Markets, noted in a recent research update that e-commerce giant Amazon, in particular, seems to be increasingly pursuing a low-cost model when purchasing truck transportation. “First, core carriers and dedicated carriers appear to be used by Amazon only in cases where brokers cannot find cheaper capacity in the open market,” he said. “This is a new, less attractive version of what core carriers and dedicated fleets traditionally represented [and] we have heard that several carriers have backed away from this customer for this reason.” This is also occurring within a truckload pricing environment that continues to be difficult, as well, Larkin added. Popular Now New CEO and president for U.S. Xpress Pix: Expo Transporte truck show in Guadalajara, Mexico ConocoPhillips reports on liquid titanium-enhanced oil “[The truckload market] is still tough; excess capacity continues to exist, prolonging a very competitive pricing environment,” he said. “Trucking companies are still having trouble finding drivers and, to boot, poor weather is troubling the first quarter.” E-commerce is also becoming something of a “destructive force” in the retail sector, which represents a key freight demand market for trucking. The inaugural Benchmark Report: e-Commerce Impacts Global Trade launched by the American Association of Exporters & Importers (AAEI) in partnership with software provider Amber Road last month, stressed that retailers that are slow to adopt new online channels are suffering in slowing brick-and-mortar sales, “leading to store closures or bankruptcy.” Meanwhile, e-commerce activity continues to increase rapidly. According to a report by Adobe Digital Insights, between November 1st and December 31st last year, online sales hit $91.7 billion – up 11% from $82.5 billion during the same period in 2015. “E-commerce is not new but it has reached critical mass; it’s increasing 20% per year and is a destructive force most prominently in the retail sector,” Marianne Rowden, AAEI’s president & CEO, explained in a recent conference call with reporters. “The impact of this colossal growth on online sales is especially being felt in cross-border sales, affecting shippers, transport providers, and others,” she said. And those challenges are carrying over to 2017, noted Gary Barraco, director of product marketing for Amber Road, on the same call. “The pace of change is only accelerating – redefining what it means to be ‘agile’ in supply chain operations,” he said. “Online [sales] grew by leaps and bounds [last year] especially emerging markets where low cost goods are hard to find in local shops.” Barraco pointed out that sales of goods over the Internet is expected to be worth $1 trillion by 2020 and will comprise 13% of global trade by 2019. E-commerce alone will be worth $3.5 trillion by 2023, he added.   “The sheer size and potential of e-commerce sales are too lucrative to pass up,” Barraco stressed. “Some 95% [of retailers polled in the new report] have an optimistic experience with online sales and 51% are seeing an uptick in overall sales due to it. This is indicative of a new dynamic in retail [with] e-commerce beating 3-to-1 online sales to brick-and-mortar sales over the holidays.” He added that led to widespread “retooling” of retail supply chain models in January and February; a “retooling” that no signs of stopping. “[Retailers] are scrambling to change their sales processes to meet change in consumer habits; we’re looking at a 12-month pattern of falling in-store sales, with a huge corresponding increases in online sales,” Barraco noted. “We have a huge swing. For example, the Sports Authority closed 400 stores last year and Walmart closed 269 stores.” He pointed out that, ultimately, more than one industry will get impacted by this shift in the retail sector to online sales. “Distribution centers [DCs] and logistics providers are slowing down their business with brick-and-mortar stores; shopping malls are taking it on chin; and [local] governments are seeing a loss of tax revenues,” he emphasized. “Technology is also changing rapidly [as] the consumer sets the bar – they are driving demand. They want to purchase products easily across the globe, so there will be competition with online marketing places and manufacturers selling direct to consumers.” This is already triggering change in “seemingly the most entrenched supply chains,” Barraco said. “Kellogg is overhauling its supply chain – they are shuttering 39 of their own DCs, consolidating, then shipping right from the manufacturing plant to grocery store warehouses directly. Why? Because customers are increasingly doing more shopping online,” he stressed. “These colossal changes are being made to meet consumer demands.” Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Sarah Halzack By Sarah Halzack March 14 Follow @sarahhalzack There’s no doubt that online shopping is a wave that is roiling the retail industry — and our culture, for that matter. But it’s wave that’s not sweeping up all shoppers in quite the same way. According to new data, the rise of online shopping across the United States is rather uneven, with more affluent states marching more quickly toward a lifestyle in which buying happens on a screen instead of at the mall. Adobe, whose software runs under many retail websites, analyzes data on billions of website visits to create its Digital Price Index, a real-time snapshot of online consumer spending. Analysts there studied digital shopping patterns over the one-year period ended February 2017. At a state level, they measuring the growth in total e-commerce spending, as well as the online spending per person. Looking first at the year-over-year growth rates in total spending, you see the choppiness. For example, coastal states such as New Hampshire, Oregon, Rhode Island, New Jersey and California have some of the strongest surges in online shopping. But big pickups are not limited those geographies, with Texas and Mississippi also posting robust e-commerce growth. Maryland saw an 8 percent increase in spending, while Virginia saw a 7 percent increase. Meanwhile, online spending actually retreated or held steady in a handful states, including Idaho and South Dakota. But things get especially interesting is when you look at per-person online spending in relationship to the state’s affluence.The second chart below plots per-person online spending against the most recent Census Bureau figures for state-level median income. As you can see, there is a noticeable correlation that suggests affluent shoppers are adapting to online shopping especially quickly. Luiz Maykot, a data science analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, said a number of factors could be shaping the difference, including that low-income shoppers are less likely to have credit cards, which are table stakes to participating in online shopping. There are other interesting lessons embedded in this chart, too. Look, for example, at Alaska and Hawaii, which are affluent states that don’t fit the pattern of having strong per-person online spending. Maykot said this likely reflects the fact that shipping to those states can be pricey and relatively slow — factors that make online shopping less attractive. The data also offers hints that perhaps our varied adoption of online shopping is not just about relative affluence, but other lifestyle factors. Take, for example, how much the District of Columbia stands out in the data set. It’s a city, and its growth and spending look much different than in any of the 50 states. The District’s growth in per-person online spending was 38 percent during the one-year period. The next-largest growth rate, recorded in New Hampshire, was significantly lower: 20 percent. Plus consumers in the District spent a whopping $3,353 per person online. That is dramatically higher than the per-person rate in any state. (New Jersey was the highest, with $1,736 per person.) So perhaps the gap is telling us that urbanites, in general, have migrated to online shopping much faster than their counterparts in less densely populated areas. Maykot said that while he can’t say for sure because Adobe doesn’t yet perform city-level analyses, this is a “credible hypothesis” for why D.C. is an outlier. After all, there are unique pain points to brick-and-mortar shopping in cities: Checkout lines at high-traffic stores can be excruciatingly long. Nabbing an on-street parking spot can feel like a miracle. Many city residents don’t own a car, and it can be hard to lug purchases on public transit or on foot. All these factors may be pushing them to adopt online shopping more quickly than those in smaller towns. Taken together, this data helps provide valuable context for how we should think about the business strategies of some of the biggest names in retail. For example, Amazon’s same-day delivery service is largely concentrated in affluent cities. Sure, that’s in part because the economics are better when customers are clustered close together. But this information also suggests that Amazon is first trying to make this a habit among the kinds of shoppers who are already the most dependent on e-commerce. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) Similarly, people sometimes ask me how Walmart, for example, could possibly be sustaining over 4,000 U.S. stores in the digital era. This data helps explain that: You may see a tower of Amazon boxes in your big-city condo building each evening, but that isn’t a good proxy for how people are shopping in, say, rural Tennessee. Even if you’re personally doing less of it these days, there is still enormous appetite for shopping in brick-and-mortar stores. And yet Adobe’s research suggests there are ways to attract different kinds of shoppers — including low-income ones — to the digital channel. Take, for example, what Adobe observed during the holiday season when it came to purchasing TVs. Researchers looked at how many televisions were bought online during November and December in each state, and then looked at what share of those purchases were made during Black Friday week — the time period when discounts were running highest. States with lower median incomes tended to see a larger share of TVs bought during Black Friday week, suggesting value pricing was important in getting these consumers to fill their digital shopping carts. “If retailers want to bring more low-income people into the online space, that week is very important for you,” Maykot said. business economy true Please provide a valid email address.

To what extent his policies will affect individual Americans is up for debate. The administration, for instance, disagrees with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s report that estimates his health reform plan would see 24 million additional Americans go without health insurance within 10 years. Here’s a look at some estimates of how his policies will affect Americans. Health care Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan are pushing legislation that would repeal key aspects of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Changing the health insurance marketplace is a complicated business, and there is no universal agreement on how any legislation would affect coverage. But the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan scorekeeper on Capitol Hill, released its best guess — the official score of the legislation — on Monday, and some of the numbers are quite large. Immigration From the day he announced his campaign, Trump made cracking down on undocumented immigration one of his signature issues. He pledged to round up and deport the millions of men, women and children who live in this country without documentation. He pledged to build a wall with Mexico and make the country pay for it. He also pledged to build a “big, beautiful door” in that wall to facilitate legal immigration. Shortly after taking office, Trump issued a broad executive order enforcing immigration law that calls for an end to sanctuary cities and a robust increase in resources to the Department of Homeland Security to increase the level of deportations. These moves could affect the more than 11 million estimated undocumented immigrants in the US. However, Trump has signaled a willingness to respect Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that Obama started to offer legal status to people who came to the US as children and still live in there. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has touted a major decrease in recorded illegal Southwest border crossings as evidence that the President has quickly changed the situation at the border. Federal hiring freeze The number of executive branch employees has floated around 2.7 million since the mid-1990s. With a goal of reducing that workforce, Trump imposed a freeze on new hires, which could cut the number of employees while increasing reliance on contractors. The White House said the freeze did not apply to the military, and Trump has called for an increase in defense spending. Trump took another action on immigration enforcement, and DHS guidance on that action said it would request 10,000 additional employees for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and 5,000 new employees for Customs and Border Protection. The travel ban Trump’s executive order imposing a so-called travel ban has garnered global attention. The original order suspended the refugee program and temporarily halted travel to the US by citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries. People caught in the air during the rushed implementation of the order were detained at airports and some were flown back to the countries they flew in from. All in all, 746 individuals nationwide were detained, including green-card holders. According to Pew, people from these countries made over 900,000 entries to the US since 2005. A government lawyer said more than 100,000 visas had been revoked though later the same day, the State Department disputed the number, saying it was closer to 60,000. The executive order was halted in the court system, and after one ruling, Trump tweeted, “SEE YOU IN COURT!” Trump issued a new executive order targeting six Muslim-majority countries and putting in place a temporary ban on all refugees. The new ban doesn’t include Iraq and specifically exempts green-card holders and those with valid visas. The order, issued on March 6, is due to take effect on March 16. Even with the changes, aimed at avoiding legal challenges and smoothing implementation, the new order would affect millions directly. Transgender students The Trump administration rescinded guidance from the Obama administration that protected the right of transgender students in public schools to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identities. In 2016, the Department of Education said there were 50.4 million students in public schools, but as The New York Times noted, the number of transgender children has been “elusive” — in that no official data or agreed-upon measure exist. The Williams Institute at UCLA released a study in 2016 that found about 0.6% of US adults identified as transgender; another study from the institute in January 2017 estimated 0.7% of people ages 13 to 17 years old identified as transgender. However, these estimates may not be reflective of the population of transgender children in public schools. Private prisons Then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates last August directed the Bureau of Prisons to restrict its use of private prisons, a formal shift away from their use in federal incarceration. Quickly within his tenure, Attorney General Jeff Sessions reversed the Obama administration’s shift away from private prisons. The federal and state private prison populations have increased over the years, experiencing a small dip in the latter portion of the Obama administration. However, people incarcerated in private prisons make up only a tiny fraction of the federal and state prison populations. The guidance to the Bureau of Prisons would only affect federal prisoners. Although its impact on the overall prison population would be relatively small, Trump’s election ushered in a reversal of fortunes for the private prison industry. Following his election, CoreCivic — previously known as the Corrections Corporation of America — and the Geo Group saw their stocks rocket upward. The Yemen raid Just days into office, Trump greenlighted a major raid in Yemen with the stated goal of targeting al Qaeda. The raid has since become more controversial than most operations because of the death of Navy SEAL William “Ryan” Owens and reports of many civilian deaths, including the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki. Drone strikes under Obama had previously killed Awlaki, a US citizen and al Qaeda spokesman, as well as Awlaki’s 16-year-old son. The US government said several other service members were injured in addition to Owens’ death. It also claimed to have killed 14 al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula fighters in the raid. Human Rights Watch has said at least 9 children were killed along with five other civilians. However, as Buzzfeed noted, confirmation of the total number of deaths and who they were does not yet exist — and may never exist. The United States has since executed dozens of strikes, saying that it did more than 30 in Yemen in one week. Pipelines Trump moved to expedite the process holding up two major oil pipeline projects that have earned blowback from environmentalists and the communities affected by their construction. One is Keystone XL, a major project to transport oil from Canada through the US. Environmentalists railed against the project for years, while Big Oil and labor groups united in support of the project. Obama ultimately opposed the pipeline, but Trump reversed course. The other project is the Dakota Access Pipeline, which has enraged the Sioux Tribe at the Standing Rock reservation in North and South Dakota. The company working to build the pipeline has said the tribe will not be affected, but the tribe has said the pipeline poses a direct threat to their lives. A non-Native American community had successfully blocked the pipeline from being constructed through its territory. According to the pipeline’s site: “The Dakota Access Pipeline project will result in an estimated $156 million in sales and income taxes during construction, and $55 million in property taxes annually.” The Sioux tribe numbered about 8,500 people in 2015, and it stood in staunch opposition to the project, attracting protesters from around the country. At the peak of protests, the camp’s population climbed to as many as 10,000 people. TPP The Trans-Pacific Partnership was a proposal among the governments of 13 Pacific-facing countries that sought to establish one harmonious free trade zone. The deal would have brought a plurality of the global economy under one umbrella, pointedly excluding China from coordination with many of its neighbors, and it built on North American Free Trade Agreement extensively. If the deal were ratified and to take effect, it could have been one of the most influential policy changes of the Obama administration. However, Obama faced steep resistance to the deal within his own party, and during the presidential election, both contenders for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination — free trade skeptic Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who once called TPP “the gold standard” of trade deals — came out against it. While support for the deal crumbled within the Democratic Party, the largely pro-free trade Republican coalition began to rally around Trump, who has for years railed against free trade deals and cited the US trade deficit as a cause for concern. Quickly after taking office, Trump pulled the US out of the deal. Several member countries said in turn that they would have to abandon the TPP on their end as well, and Trump has said he will pursue bilateral trade agreements as well as a review of NAFTA. Bringing jobs back Trump has leaned into a few companies since the election, saying he is using his position to stop companies from off-shoring jobs and getting contractors to cut back on their prices. Trump said a Carrier worker reminded him of a promise he made to stop Carrier’s Indiana factory workers from being outsourced to Mexico. Alongside then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence — now Trump’s vice president — Trump announced that he had saved the jobs. However, the workers’ union said Trump didn’t save all the jobs, just under 800. Trump attacked the union chief for speaking out, and some of the jobs are still on track to be outsourced or eliminated. Trump publicly aired grievances with the cost of some F-35 flight variants, and Lockheed in turn lowered the cost slightly of three of the joint strike fighters. All told, Lockheed said Trump had caused them to save the US $700 million on what is already the most expensive weapons project ever. Dow Chemical said it would create 100 new jobs and “repatriate” 100 others. Trump and his White House have also touted planned moves by GM, Ford, SoftBank, FiatChrysler, Amazon, Walmart, Intel and ExxonMobil. Some companies have credited Trump’s agenda for their plans while others haven’t commented on Trump at all. CNNMoney has a running fact check on these announcements. Other Obama-era rollbacks Republicans had for years protested Obama’s executive orders and regulatory actions as overreach, even warning of the specter of an “imperial presidency.” So newly empowered with control of both houses of Congress and the White House, Republicans in Washington moved swiftly to roll back Obama-era rules. Some were undone with the Congressional Review Act, a rarely invoked law that allows Congress to undo executive actions permanently. And other policy changes have come either from Trump’s pen or his administration’s agencies, many of which are now headed by people with radically different visions from their predecessors. Here is a list of rules either eliminated or under review: Stream protection rule This rule was meant to prevent waste materials from coal mines entering water sources. It had originally gone into effect on January 19, according to the Department of the Interior. Trump signed a bill ending the rule on February 16. Oil payment disclosure The SEC adopted the Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers rule on July 27, 2016. The rule required oil, natural gas and mineral companies to tell the SEC if they made payments to foreign governments. Supporters saw it as an anti-corruption measure while opponents, particularly in the energy sector, said it put US energy companies in a bad position relative to companies from other countries. Congress passed a bill blocking the rule in early February, and Trump signed it into law on February 14. Fiduciary rule — under review The Department of Labor unveiled the fiduciary rule, also known as the fiduciary standard, in April 2016 with an applicability date of April 10, 2017. It would require retirement advisers to always act in the best interest of their clients, regulating potential conflicts of interest for retirement advisers. Trump signed an executive order putting it under review on February 3. Mortgage rate cut One of the very first actions in the Trump administration was wiping out a Housing and Urban Development rule issued in the final days of the Obama administration. The rule creating a mortgage rate cut for people with low incomes would have gone into effect on January 27. On Inauguration Day, HUD issued a letter stopping it. Waters of the US — under review The EPA enacted a rule, effective on August 28, 2015, under the Clean Water Act that gave the government regulatory authority over waterways throughout the country. Trump signed an executive order reviewing the economic impact of the Waters of the United States rule at the end of February. Gun measure The Obama administration implemented a rule on December 19, 2016, aimed at preventing Americans with a mental illness from getting guns by sharing information with the national background check system. It said the rule would be effective January 18 with compliance not required until December 19, 2017. Trump signed a bill to eliminate it on February 28. Mexico City policy Implemented by former President Ronald Reagan in 1984, the Mexico City policy, or Global Gag Rule, blocks US funding to non-governmental organizations that perform or promote abortions. Since Reagan instituted the rule, it’s ping-ponged in and out of existence depending on the political party of the President. Obama rescinded the rule, and on January 23, Trump reinstituted it. Kaiser Family Foundation has a guide that outlines the history of the policy. Voting Rights Act lawsuit Under Obama, the Department of Justice battled rules it believed were in violation of the Voting Rights Act, which the Supreme Court ruled against in part. On February 27, Sessions’ DOJ shifted away from a legal battle against Texas SB 14, a voter ID law. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, now Trump’s energy secretary, signed the bill into law on May 27, 2011. The move offers an early sign of the wide gulf that could emerge between the DOJ under Obama and Trump. For example, the DOJ is not expected to pursue major civil rights suits against cities and their police departments as the Obama administration had done in Fergson, Missouri, and other locations.

We’re only a year into this so-called “next big thing” and it’s hard not to notice signs of dwindling interest. SXSW, though, hasn’t really gotten the memo. Popular Searches Adobe Systems Inc ADBE ▲ 122.35 +0.24 +0.20% Intel Corp INTC ▲ 35.14 +0.04 +0.11% Verizon Communications Inc VZ ▼ 50.04 -0.10 -0.20% CBS Corp CBS.A ▼ 68.63 -0.42 -0.61% If CES was VR heaven — featuring accessories, games, and everything else you can slap a VR label on — SXSW is its fiery underworld equivalent. Just two months later, the excitement has faded, and it’s time to take your headset out to pasture. It’s over, and the only thing that remains are publishers trying to squeeze every last dime out of a trend that never really caught on. It’s not VR’s fault. It seems consumers just weren’t ready, nor was the technology. In fact, there are dozens of reasons analysts will find to explain VRs failure, but there are really only a few that are important. Barrier to entry Of the “big three” headset manufacturers, Sony was the clear-cut winner in 2016, selling more than 745,000 units. Oculus managed to sell just under a third that amount (243,000), while HTC shipped 420,000 units, according to SuperData Research. Sony’s dominance detailed the problems Oculus and HTC face moving forward. Both are a third-party solution to existing hardware, and expensive hardware at that. Sony, on the other hand, kills the barrier to entry problem by offering a plug-and-play solution to hardware millions already own. At $399, it’s a cheaper — albeit under-spec’d (when compared to Oculus and HTC) — option that taps into an established ecosystem full of gamers looking for new experiences. Spending thousands on a gaming PC is nothing new to gamers. Adding a $600-ish VR headset is a drop in the bucket compared to the money some have tucked away inside PC cases with flashing LEDs, high-end components, and enough fans to cool a small server farm. This is Oculus and HTC’s market, and one both have done reasonably well to tap. The problem, however, is that most casual gamers are of the console variety. It’s looking bleak Sony shot out of the gates, but it’s only as good as the content it offers. So far, we have a handful of release titles, and one blockbuster: Resident Evil 7. Adoption will inevitably slow if Sony doesn’t pick up the pace, and unfortunately, there’s really not all that much on the horizon to be excited about. For Sony, this is bad news. It needs more content at a time when developers are shifting away from VR just as fast as they embraced it. RocketWerkz LTD., creators of “Out of Ammo” — a $20 VR game — have recouped only 60-percent of the estimated $650,000 it cost to make the indie title. According to Dean Hall, the company’s chief executive: The future of virtual reality is very bright, but in the short term, it’s not where we see ourselves. The return on investment is not enough for us. Voyager Capitol offers another cautionary tale. After investing in Envelop VR — a company that allows users to interact virtually with traditional desktop apps — the company closed the doors last month after raising more than $5 million, according to Erik Benson, a senior partner at Voyager. “All the enthusiasm from VR manufacturers and developers just hasn’t been met with the same volume from the consumer market,” said Shauna Heller, founder of advisory firm Clay Park VR and a former developer relations specialist at Oculus. Moving forward The path forward for higher-end manufacturers seems to be in bundled hardware. Sony is the clear favorite here, but both Oculus and HTC have explored bundles that include the headset and a PC capable of running it. Unfortunately, these are still $1,500-plus solutions, compared with half that for a PlayStation console and a PS VR headset — although it’s probably the worst option of the three for the hardcore gamer. Until a VR enthusiast can walk into a local Best Buy or Walmart and plop down a fixed amount that includes a beast of a PC bundled with a high-end headset, the market is going to continue sluggish growth until it stalls altogether. If you want to pick up the pace, you have to hit consumers where they are — mobile devices. There are only a handful of machines capable of such a feat so far, but it’s clear this is the path forward. You’ll have to hit the laptop market, or beg and plea with consumers who’ve long-since abandoned desktop PCs to take a step back in time. It’s a stretch to believe this is even a possibility. By all accounts, none of these solutions are the answer. Instead, consumers are turning to smartphone-friendly solutions like Google Cardboard, or Samsung’s Gear VR. Like Sony, both offer a solution to use existing hardware without breaking the bank on upgrades — assuming you have a flagship smartphone. Smartphone VR solutions offer another benefit too: it’s easier to demonstrate the experience. Unlike PC or console-based solutions, you’re typically carrying around all you need in your pocket. Just plug in a viewer, and you’re experiencing VR within minutes. Trade shows like SXSW are the perfect example of tone deaf manufacturers ignoring consumer demand. As headsets from Google and Samsung continue to get more approachable, HTC and Oculus are quickly on their way to a fork in the road.

Outdoor retailer Gander Mountain is closing two stores in Indiana as part of a bankruptcy restructuring plan, but the Greenwood location will remain open. Gander Mountain sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization Friday. The company plans to close 32 of the 150-plus stores it has in 26 states. The closing list does not include Indianapolis-area stores in Castleton, Avon and Greenwood, which was built in 2005 at County Line Road and Interstate 65 next to the Walmart. The stores in Greenfield and Merrillville are slated to close. The retailer has other Indiana stores in Lafayette, Terre Haute, Fort Wayne and Evansville. A company statement says the stores will begin closing in coming weeks, but it doesn’t give a date for the shutdowns. The Minnesota-based company is blaming the closings on changing consumer patterns linked to online merchandising. Gander Mountain got its start in 1960 as a catalog-based retailer of hunting and camping supplies. The retailer has gone through several acquisitions, gone public twice and filed for reorganization in the 1980s and the 1990s.
