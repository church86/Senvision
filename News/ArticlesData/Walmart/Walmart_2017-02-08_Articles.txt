Saturday, February 11, 2017 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Archive thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Business  Wal-Mart aims to leverage British arm Asda back to health February 10, 2017, Friday LONDON: Wal-Mart is throwing its weight as the world’s largest retailer behind its struggling British arm Asda after admitting it was too slow to respond effectively to the threat posed by the discount supermarkets. Asda thrived for a decade as Britain’s cheapest supermarket after it was bought by Wal-Mart in 1999 and remains the third-biggest in the country. But German-owned Aldi and Lidl have steadily cut into Asda’s market share. The two discounters started opening stores in the UK in 1990 and 1994, respectively, but their big breakthrough came when the economic crisis hit in 2008 and more British shoppers were prepared to give them a go. Declining sales show signs of tapering off since Wal-Mart veteran Sean Clarke became Asda’s president and chief executive last July, with a focus on improving the look and feel of the stores as well as enhancing product lines. Wal-Mart will provide further firepower by ensuring Asda leverages the parent’s purchasing strength in everything from refrigerators to own-brand products and real estate to drive down prices and costs, said Scott Price, chief administrative officer of Walmart International. “One thing that maybe we would criticise ourselves for is that we didn’t start the repositioning of the business sooner, that we didn’t focus more on the leverage opportunities so that Asda was able to invest more aggressively in price,” Price told Reuters in an interview. “What Sean is able to do with his global experience at Wal-Mart is to know what levers to pull,” he said, in a reference to Clarke’s time with Wal-Mart in Japan, Canada and most recently as chief executive in China. Working more closely with its parent, Asda will be able to market more Wal-Mart brands as its own at a lower price than rivals, Price said. “He’s able to pull private (Wal-Mart) brands and put an Asda brand on it that is equal to the national brand in the UK in terms of quality and sensory, but at a price that no one else can match,” he said of Clarke. In return, Wal-Mart was looking for more ways to exploit the areas where Asda has excelled, for example with a popular olive oil originally sourced by Asda and now sold across the group, including in the United States and 10 other international markets. From its headquarters in Leeds in northern England, Asda claimed to be the first of Britain’s major grocers – which also includes market leader Tesco, No. 2 Sainsbury’s and No. 4 Morrisons – to spot the threat from the discounters. With fewer stores in the more affluent southeast of England than its rivals and the vast majority of its business in the large stores that have become less fashionable in recent years, Asda was most exposed. After it lost its price advantage and failed to offer other reasons to shop there, performance slumped. Wal-Mart added to Asda’s problems by diverting key executives from Britain to the United States and focusing too much on cutting costs and maximising short-term profit at the expense of investing to protect market share, analysts said. The result has been nine straight quarters of underlying sales decline since the middle of 2014, which translated into a more than 1 per centage point loss in market share, according to researcher Kantar Worldpanel. Its share currently stands at 15.6 per cent, versus more than 28 per cent for Tesco. David Cheesewright, CEO of Walmart International, in June expressed disappointment at Asda’s weak performance and said it would shift from protecting profit to protecting market share. The data shows signs of improving. In November Asda reported a like-for-like sales decline of 5.8 per cent for the third quarter to Sept 30, compared to the second quarter when it reported a fall of 7.5 per cent, its worst drop in quarterly sales. A further material improvement is expected when it reports fourth quarter sales on Feb. 21, with analysts forecasting a decline of 2-3 per cent. Monthly industry data has also shown a better performance over Christmas and January. While sales fell 1.9 per cent year-on-year by value in the 12 weeks to Jan. 29, according to Kantar, Asda increased the number of shoppers visiting its stores. The improvements reflect the early work of Clarke and former Sainsbury’s executive Roger Burnley, who joined as chief operating officer in October, analysts said. That includes making Asda stores cleaner and less cluttered, with more staff on the shop floor and better availability of fresh produce and meat –key ranges that either drive customers into stores or, if you get them wrong, out. Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital, said there are also signs that Asda is stepping up product innovation with, for example, new items in the frozen and chilled areas and in its ‘Extra Special’ premium brand. At the same time Asda has developed complementary services and partners within its stores, such as with sports retailer Decathlon and butcher McGee’s, while more freedom is being given to individual managers when it comes to the layout of their stores. It looks likely to be a long road to recovery, however. “Things are going a bit better but they’re going a bit better from a catastrophic level of performance,” one senior UK retail industry executive told Reuters, asking not to be named. “Everybody thinks you can turn around a business in a year or two and you can’t. This is a five-year project,” he said. He questioned whether Wal-Mart would provide the necessary investment. “Their instinct is to save their way to victory.” Price said Wal-Mart was committed to Asda and has tasked Clarke with building a sustainable business model. While Asda has said it will cut prices equating to 1.5 billion pounds of savings to the customer over five years from November 2013, washing through at about 300 million pounds a year, Price declined to say what additional investment was required in the stores. “We are making very solid progress, (but) there’s no timeline (for recovery),” he said. — Reuters What do you think of this story?

It’s her daughter’s birthday. But every year, two weeks earlier, she now marks another anniversary: the day that same daughter disappeared. Kelsie Schelling was 21 years old and eight weeks pregnant when she vanished on Feb. 4, 2013. She had her first doctor’s visit and had seen a sonogram of her baby earlier that day. After the trip to the doctor and a shift at work, the Denver woman drove two hours south to Pueblo to visit her boyfriend and the father of her child, Donthe Lucas. But exactly what happened once Schelling got to Pueblo remains a mystery. She hasn’t been seen since. Watch Liz Gelardi and James Dougherty's video version of this story in the player below or by clicking here. What happened to Kelsie? “Her phone was going straight to voicemail,” Saxton says. On Feb. 7, Pueblo police found Schelling’s car, a black 2011 Chevy Cruze, at St. Mary-Corwin Medical Center in southern Pueblo. They pored over surveillance tape and found an unidentified black man had pulled up and parked it, then walked away. Police started looking over surveillance footage from other businesses and discovered that Lucas had parked the car at a Walmart three miles west of the hospital on Feb. 5, the day after Schelling was last seen. She wasn’t with him in the video. Donthe Lucas was Schelling's boyfriend and eventually became a person of interest in her disappearance. (Photo by James Dougherty, Denver7 Photographer) Then, police watched as video from Feb. 6 showed the unidentified man get in the car and drive off. He dropped the car at St. Mary-Corwin the next day and still hasn’t been identified. But the location of the car proved noteworthy later, when Lucas told investigators he had at one point dropped Schelling off at Parkview Medical Center – almost 4.5 miles north of St. Mary-Corwin. Parkview confirmed Schelling was never there. A lawsuit filed by Saxton and Schelling’s father in 2015 against Lucas, his family members and various members of the Pueblo Police Department that contains bits of the police investigation and unveils some of the details about the time leading up to Schelling’s disappearance. It contains records of text messages Schelling and Lucas exchanged in the days leading up to her disappearance. Since the two agencies now handling the case consider it to be an open investigation, the details are not public record and were not released to Denver7. The lawsuit has since been dropped, but is one of the only public documents that detail police records in the case. The ultrasound that Kelsie got before driving to Pueblo, where she disappeared. (Photo courtesy Laura Saxton.) According to the messages, Lucas had wanted Schelling to come down to visit him a day earlier, but she told him she had to make her Feb. 4 doctor’s visit. Eventually the next day, she agreed to come to visit him after she got off work. She arrived at the same Walmart where Lucas was eventually seen with her car just before midnight Feb. 4, but Lucas wasn’t there. The two exchanged messages, and around 12:30 a.m., Schelling sent Lucas another message wondering why he still hadn’t shown up, according to the suit. It was the last time anyone knew she was alive. At some point, Schelling left the Walmart and went to another address. Phone records show Lucas called her phone again just before 4 a.m. on Feb. 5 and that the two phones were close to one another at the time, according to the suit. At 11:39 a.m., Lucas was seen at a Pueblo bank, where he allegedly withdrew $400 with Schelling’s debit card. Not long afterward, the Walmart surveillance video showed him dropping Schelling’s car off and being picked up. Saxton’s lawsuit says Lucas’ mother and grandmother were in that car. Charges dropped against boyfriend; family gets scammed Pueblo police eventually identified Lucas as a primary person of interest in Schelling’s disappearance and arrested him on felony identity theft and misdemeanor theft charges for allegedly using her debit card to make the withdrawal. But the charges were dropped and no one else was arrested in connection with Schelling’s disappearance. “It was pretty much a debacle from the beginning,” Saxton says. She continues to have reservations about the work Pueblo detectives did on the case and maintains that she believes Lucas had something to do with her daughter vanishing. A photo of Schelling from before she disappeared. (Photo courtesy Laura Saxton.) The 2015 suit accuses the department of failing to properly process her car, not submitting evidence and lying to Saxton and her family about possible evidence found in and on the car. It also claimed that the lead detective on the case failed to follow up on a tip from a fisherman who said he had hooked a woman’s body in Lake Minnequa, which sits in between the Walmart and the hospital where Schelling’s car was found. But in October 2015, Saxton got a glimmer of hope when, through the Facebook page she started to find her daughter, a message arrived from someone saying Schelling was alive. The mysterious messenger knew explicit details of the case and said Schilling wasn’t killed, but instead was human trafficked. The messenger told Saxton to bring $25,000 to a McDonald’s in Vancouver, Washington, and she’d get her daughter back. She contacted local police to loop them in on the deal in case it was a set up. But before it could even take place, Vancouver police found out she was being scammed. Saxton was back to square one, her daughter still a ghost. New investigators, increased reward bring hope In Saxton’s mind, Lucas’ story just doesn’t add up – despite the fact that no formal charges relating to Schelling’s disappearance were ever filed against him. Pueblo police say he remains a person of interest because he was the last person known to see her alive. Requests to speak with Lucas for this story went unreturned. Lucas was arrested on charges relating to him allegedly using Schelling's debit card, but the charges were eventually dropped. (Photo courtesy ABC News.) “I have no doubt that Danthe – her boyfriend, the father of her child – is responsible for her disappearance,” she said. “I can’t sleep at night. I hope he can’t either.” But she says she has hope that new leads will soon come in the case. The Pueblo Police Department has assigned a new lead detective to the case and the Colorado Bureau of Investigation joined on to assist last spring – a welcome sign, according to her, since she says the department had been reluctant to turn the entire case over to the bureau. Pueblo police did not directly address the early days of the investigation when asked, but the department says it is hopeful that after four years, someone might be willing to break their silence about the case. “I think Kelsie’s case is very solvable. I think it should’ve been solved a long time before now, and we’re not giving up…there will be a resolution to this,” Saxton says. She says she hopes the added help from CBI, which is involved with a task force devoted to missing persons cases and cold cases in the state, will help turn up new evidence. “We’re hopeful that somebody is going to see this and just say it’s time, the suffering needs to end,” Saxton says. “We’re just praying really hard about that – that someone will come forward with some piece of information that will lead us to where she is.” The family doubled the reward for information on the whereabouts of Schelling or her remains to $100,000 for the month of February in the hopes of getting more leads. CBI Director Michael Rankin says his when his team is brought in they re-examine and scrutinize the evidence and details collected in the case so far. Laura Saxton stands in front of the state Capitol in Denver on Colorado Missing Persons Day. (Photo by James Dougherty, Denver7 Photographer) “I think that the starting point [is] let’s take a look at, first of all, what happened? What do we know? What’s been done to further that investigation, and then, where can the CBI plug in to further advance the investigation and hopefully the prosecution as well,” Rankin said. He showed up to a Colorado Missing Persons Day Event organized by Saxton at the state Capitol in Denver on Feb. 3 to reinforce the agency’s support for families with missing loved ones. Dozens of families of missing people in the state and of cold case murder victims’ flanked him as he thanked her personally. And the next day, on the anniversary of Schelling’s death, Saxton and other family members revisited the Walmart in Pueblo where the pregnant 21-year-old was last known to have been, releasing purple balloons in her memory and in the hopes her case will someday be solved. “To lose somebody and to not know what happened to them, to not be able to have answers, to bury them, to honor them…your mind constantly runs,” Saxton says. “I hope she’s found. I pray to God she’s found.” Schelling would have celebrated her 26th birthday on Feb. 18. --- Anyone who may have information regarding Kelsie Schelling’s disappearance is asked to contact the Pueblo Police Department at 719-553-2538 or Colorado Bureau of Investigation at 303-239-4300. Saxton has also created a website dedicated to helping find her daughter. The Family of Homicide Victims and Missing Persons is also a resource for families of murdered and missing persons and does extensive work in Colorado. --------- Sign up for Denver7 email alerts to stay informed about breaking news and daily headlines.

Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Feb 9, 2017 at 4:16PM Can Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) save the craft-beer industry? Few are aware that the deep-discount retailer has been selling its own craft beer for almost a year now, but as more people discover it, there's the potential for it to revive industry sales. No laughing matter Before you laugh, there might be some very good reasons this could happen. After years of double-digit growth, craft breweries are expected to post just single-digit gains for 2016. Even though there are more than 5,000 U.S. craft breweries in existence today, more than at any other time in the country's past, the Brewers Association industry trade group estimates that volumes grew only around 8% last year. Others think it could be even lower. Image source: Wal-Mart. The market analysts at IRI, for example, say its channel checks indicate fourth-quarter volumes rose only 3% from the year-ago period, leaving full-year volumes up just 5%.  Much of the weakness is due to reports of soft sales from the largest names in the industry. Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM), which many consider to still be the face of craft beer, suffered an 8% drop in depletions in the third quarter and expects them to fall by as much as 6% for the full year, compared with previous guidance that saw them as possibly being flat. (Depletions are shipments to distributors and retailers and are considered a reliable industry proxy for consumer demand.) Similarly, Craft Brew Alliance, New Belgium Brewing, and even Anheuser-Busch InBev's Shock Top brand are all suffering from slack sales. While a few of these might not fit the industry definition of what constitutes a craft brewer, beer drinkers still view their beer as craft. That showing would coincide with IRI's data showing that brewers such as Boston Beer and Pabst were down sharply in the last three months of 2016, with Craft Brew Alliance, New Belgium, and Gambrinus down by low- to mid-single-digit rates. It's not all bad news, as brewers such as Lagunitas and Dogfish Head, among others, were up by double-digit percentages. Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) also surged, and though much of that increase might be attributable to its imported Corona brands, it also has its Ballast Point craft brand to thank, as it's been living up to its reputation as the fastest-growing craft beer. Wal-Mart to the rescue? So how is Wal-Mart going to save the industry? First, the retailer isn't actually brewing beer on its own in Bentonville, Ark., but rather contracts with WX Brands, which describes itself as developing "exclusive brands of wine, beer, and spirits for retailers around the world." It packages Wal-Mart's craft beers under the Trouble Brewing brand and offers a number of beer labels such as Cat's Away IPA, After Party Pale Ale, and California-only Pacific Drift. A 12-pack of a Wal-Mart craft brew sells for around $13. Image source: Wal-Mart. While you might not find many hipsters shopping Wal-Mart's craft-beer aisle looking to pick up some 'Round Midnight Belgian White, with more than 4,600 stores nationwide it remains the most heavily trafficked grocery store in the country, and stocking its shelves with "craft beer" has the potential to introduce more people to craft labels than just about any other outlet. The mass merchandiser might not break any sales records or have Boston Beer worrying it will be stealing market share from it, but as the supermarket giant told The Street last year, "We want to bring craft beer to the masses." Although there's a level of snobbery in the craft-beer market that would exclude a Wal-Mart beer from being considered truly craft, the retailer has a unique ability to put craft beer front and center for the American consumer in a way no one else is able to. Beer drinkers who might normally not consider anything other than some mass-produced suds might now join the traditional craft-beer crowd that's constantly on the prowl for new flavors and tastes. And anything that introduces more people to craft beer can't be all bad. Even if what they're drinking is a Wal-Mart Red Flag Amber, it's a development that might very well reverse the craft-beer industry's sinking fortunes.

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Feb 9, 2017 at 1:00PM February will be a busy month for investors. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) will report this week, looking to extend its streak of impressive earnings beats. Networking hardware giant Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) reports next week, aiming to convince investors that its transition to a softwarecentric company will eventually return it to growth. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) will report in two weeks, in the midst of a major shift in its e-commerce strategy . Sky-high expectations Graphics chip company NVIDIA destroyed analyst estimates throughout 2016, with its latest quarterly report in November beating expectations by a wide margin. Its gaming business is booming, driven by strong demand for its Pascal graphics cards and the soon-to-launch Nintendo Switch game console. The data center and automotive businesses, both much smaller than gaming, are growing at an even faster rate. Image source: NVIDIA. When its fourth-quarter results are revealed after the market close on Thursday, Feb. 9., all eyes will be on whether NVIDIA can keep up its incredible growth rate. Its stock more than tripled in 2016 as revenue and profit expanded rapidly, but with AMD set to launch competing high-end graphics cards in the next few months, NVIDIA's significant market share may take a hit. NVIDIA's early focus on pushing its graphics chips as machine learning accelerators has paid off in a big way. The data center segment, which includes NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs aimed the data center and high-performance computing , nearly tripled year over year during the third quarter. That kind of growth rate can't go on forever, but it's clear that NVIDIA has struck gold. With the stock now trading for around 60 times trailing-12-month earnings, the company will need to continue to impress investors in order to keep the stock price afloat. Any disappointing numbers could send this highflier tumbling. A tough quarter Cisco Systems, the dominant provider of networking hardware, doesn't expect a remarkable fiscal second quarter. The company sees its revenue declining by 2% to 4% year over year even after excluding divestitures, a slowdown that reflects both uncertainty among its major customers and its ongoing shift to a recurring revenue business model. Image source: Cisco Systems. Cisco's core switching and routing businesses were inconsistent throughout 2016, with growth in some quarters and declines in others. This was counteracted by solid growth in its smaller businesses, including collaboration, data center, and security. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, though, both the data center and collaboration segments suffered 3% year-over-year revenue declines. Security posted a double-digit increase, but the results raise questions about Cisco's growth strategy. Its fiscal second-quarter results are expected after the market close on Feb. 15. Analysts aren't expecting much, with the average estimate calling for a 3.2% decrease in revenue and a slight dip in adjusted earnings per share. Cisco recently announced a major acquisition, agreeing to pay $3.7 billion for software company AppDynamics, a move that should help accelerate its shift toward software. But Cisco remains dependent on hardware, and weakness in its core businesses will continue to hurt its results. Two-day shipping for everyone After testing a subscription shipping program similar to Amazon Prime, Wal-Mart has scrapped that effort, instead shifting to free two-day shipping on millions of items for orders over $35. This is far more generous than Amazon's non-Prime free shipping offer, which has a minimum order of $50 and shipping times that vary. Image source: Wal-Mart.http://corporate.walmart.com/galleries/e-commerce Wal-Mart has been accelerating its push into e-commerce, paying $3 billion for start-up Jet.com last year and putting Jet's CEO in charge of its entire e-commerce business. The company's online grocery service, which allows customers to place orders online and pick up for free at hundreds of Wal-Mart locations, is another facet of the e-commerce strategy, one that can't be duplicated by online-only retailers. Wal-Mart will report its fourth-quarter results before the market opens on Feb. 21. The retailer's e-commerce business has been accelerating in recent quarters, a sign that the company's initiatives are having a positive effect. Wal-Mart's stores are still the core of the business, and they enable initiatives like online grocery pickup. But Wal-Mart will need to greatly expand its e-commerce business to avoid being left in the dust. Timothy Green owns shares of Cisco Systems.

Scott Markley, a spokesman for the big-box retailer, said the deal is part of Walmart's January 2013 U.S. Manufacturing Commitment to buy an additional $250 billion in U.S. products to support American jobs over 10 years. Renfro Corporation, a long time producer of socks and hosiery products for Walmart, is based in North Carolina but has had a manufacturing facility in Fort Payne since the late 1980s. "The products that Renfro supplies to Walmart that are made in its U.S. factories include Athletic Works, Fruit of the Loom Work Gear and Dr. Scholl's healthcare products," Renfro CEO and President Bud Kilby told AL.com. "Both Walmart and Renfro share in the commitment for products made in the USA and this new arrangement was a result of that common interest." Kilby said Renfro began selling socks to Walmart in the late 1970s. As Walmart has grown over the years, so has Renfro, which now has 5,000 employees worldwide and 628 in east Alabama. Renfro has already begun filling the new manufacturing positions in Fort Payne and will continue to do so through 2018 as the company's capacity increases and Walmart's product offering evolves. "Our expanded program at Walmart represents meaningful growth in our business," Kilby said. "We expect the offering to continue to expand at Walmart, resulting in continued job growth at our U.S. factories." Walmart expects to help create 1 million jobs by purchasing American-made, grown, assembled and sourced products through 2023. In addition to Renfro, the chain is working with California Innovations to move production of the Ozark Trail "super cooler" out of China to a factory in Atlanta, creating 350 jobs. Edgewell Personal Care, which makes personal hygiene products, is also working with Walmart to create 272 jobs by bringing production from Canada to Delaware. "We're making a tangible impact on communities across America," Markley said. "In the three years since we launched our initiative, we've seen factories opened, jobs created and American products added to our shelves in stores and online." Renfro is a global business, but has manufactured products in its own U.S. factories continuously since 1921. The company has other plants in Mount Airy, N.C.; Los Angeles; Cleveland, Tenn.; and Clinton, S.C. Kilby said there are advantages to manufacturing in the U.S., such as lower energy costs, reliable labor and infrastructure, and closer proximity to the consumer market. "We want to offer good jobs to people here in the U.S.," he said. "This builds stronger communities and serves all of our interests."

Walmart says it will begin to source materials from American-based companies like Renfro Corporation in an effort to invest in U.S. manufacturing. Renfro Corporation believes the investments will create around 442 jobs in textile manufacturing, namely by providing Walmart with athletic socks. Renfro Corp. currently has 605 employees and is the largest employer in Fort Payne’s hosiery industry, according to the DeKalb County Economic Development Authority.  These new jobs will push the company over the 1,000 mark. Additionally, Walmart will partner with six universities across the country to help advance sustainability in the production of textiles. Across the country, Walmart said it plans to create up to 34,000 jobs and spend $6.8 billion in capital investments. The investments will go towards construction and remodeling stores, as well as expansion of new services such as its new Online Grocery Pickup. The company’s announcement also follows a commitment made in 2013 to purchase an additional $250 billion in American-made, sourced, and assembled products through 2023. Walmart believes the commitment will produce around one million jobs. 34.444255 -85.719689 Filed in: Northeast Alabama Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Popular Meet the newest Duggar baby UPDATE: Jackson County deputy shoots, kills teen after 2 taser attempts UPDATE: Triple homicide suspect Boyette dead, Rice in custody in Georgia Latest News Bo Jackson to lead annual charity bike ride April 29 Super Bowl Champion surprises his mother with 1,000 flowers March of Dimes walk Marshall Co.

Timothy Green, Todd Campbell, and Brian Feroldi (TMFBargainBin) Feb 9, 2017 at 8:40AM When a company manages to raise its dividend every year for decades, investors should take notice. A quarter-century of annual dividend hikes earns the title of Dividend Aristocrat, an exclusive club of a just few dozen companies. Out of those companies, three of our Fool contributors think Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), and Nucor (NYSE:NUE) are the best buys. Here's why. All-in on e-commerce Tim Green (Wal-Mart): Retail behemoth Wal-Mart has increased its dividend every year since first declaring one in 1974. Dividend growth has been slow in recent years, with the current quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share representing just a 2% increase. But Wal-Mart is going through an important transition as it aggressively goes after the e-commerce market. These investments, along with higher wages and better training for its employees, are knocking down the company's profits. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart can no longer ignore the threat of Amazon.com and other online retailers. The company made a big move to acquire startup Jet.com last year, installing Jet CEO Marc Lore as the head of its entire e-commerce business. After toying with an Amazon Prime-like subscription service, Wal-Mart is now offering free two-day shipping on millions of items for orders above $35. Wal-Mart's e-commerce strategy is simple: Offer the best prices and fast, free shipping with no strings attached. Analysts expect Wal-Mart to produce $4.33 in earnings per share both in 2016 and 2017, down considerably from a few years ago, reflecting the headwinds created by the company's investments. The payout ratio based on these estimates is about 46%, leaving Wal-Mart some room to continue raising the dividend even if earnings continue to languish. With a dividend yield of 3% and a management team that's thinking long-term, Wal-Mart is a Dividend Aristocrat worth considering. The medical device king Brian Feroldi (Medtronic): The world's population is aging, which is a terrific tailwind for the healthcare industry in general. As a leading provider of medical devices, Medtronic is a healthcare giant that looks well positioned to benefit from the trend. Medtronic has grown into a behemoth thanks to its long history of expanding its treatments to address an ever-increasing range of diseases. While the company is likely best known for its pacemakers, Medtronic also sells devices that treat diabetes, treat neurovascular disease, assist with pain management, and more. This diversification makes Medtronic far more than just a one-trick pony. Beyond product diversification, Medtronic has also made a lot of progress at getting its products into the hands of providers around the globe. Roughly 44% of the company's revenue comes from international markets, which adds yet another layer of diversification to its business. When combined, these two factors have helped to ensure that the company's top and bottom lines move forward each and every year. That's one reason it has been able to increase its dividend for 39 consecutive years. Looking ahead, I think that the company's current product lineup and its recently announced partnerships with Fitbit and Mazor Robotics provide investors with plenty of reasons to expect more of the same. That makes Medtronic a great Dividend Aristocrat to consider adding to your portfolio today.  Betting on economic growth Todd Campbell (Nucor): Nucor's shares are currently yielding 2.63%, management has increased the dividend every year for 44 straight years, and the stock is the biggest weighting in the Pro Shares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF, but President Donald Trump is the real reason investors ought to stash this stock in their portfolios. Trump won the fight for the U.S. presidency on his plans to reinvigorate the economy, and if his plans succeed, then U.S. steel demand could jump. On the campaign trail, Trump advocated for billions in new spending on projects that could benefit Nucor, the nation's biggest steel producer. Nucor's products are used to construct highways, bridges, utilities, airports, and high-rise buildings, and that diversification makes this company a solid pick for investors trying to get exposure to GDP growth. If tariffs mean fewer steel imports, and demand for U.S. steel grows, then rising revenue could give management plenty of financial flexibility to increase dividends in the future. As fellow Fool Dan Caplinger recently pointed out, Nucor sold 5.82 million tons of steel in Q4, up 14% year over year, and Nucor's revenue rose 14% to $3.96 billion. Clearly, this company's already got momentum heading into this year, and if that momentum builds because of Trump, then this stock is worth owning in dividend portfolios.

News Business Business News GlaxoSmithKline, Asda, IBM: Business news in brief, Thursday 9 February Brexit boost for pharmaceuticals giant; Walmart aims to battle Aldi and Lidl; Tech company to train 25 million Africans for free Thursday 9 February 2017 09:29 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online WalMart boss admits it was too slow to respond effectively to the threat posed by the discount supermarkets iStock GlaxoSmithKline reveals earnings boost from Brexit-hit pound GlaxoSmithKline has revealed a boost to annual earnings from the Brexit-hit pound but warned over a potential hit from looming competition to its blockbuster asthma drug. The FTSE 100 drugs giant, which makes a significant amount of its earnings overseas, posted a 36 per cent surge in underlying operating profits to £7.8bn for 2016 thanks to the pound’s plunge since the EU referendum. It said it hopes to make “continued progress” in 2017 but cautioned over “uncertainty” if US regulators allow generic competitors to its asthma drug Advair. The group said if generic competition to Advair launched in the US in the summer, it could wipe out earnings growth and even leave earnings per share lower. Outgoing chief executive Sir Andrew Witty said: “Clearly, this year we face some uncertainty as to the level of our earnings performance, given the possibility of substitutable generic competition to Advair in the US.” But the group is hoping its new asthma medicines will help offset the sales blow. Presenting his last set of results, Sir Andrew unveiled a 17 per cent surge in annual revenues to £27.8bn and a 21 per cent leap in the fourth quarter. With the benefit of the weak pound on overseas earnings stripped out, full-year revenues were 6 per cent higher, while operating profits lifted 14 per cent. PA Walmart aims to bring struggling Asda back to health Walmart is throwing its weight as the world’s largest retailer behind its struggling British arm Asda after admitting it was too slow to respond effectively to the threat posed by the discount supermarkets. Asda thrived for a decade as the country’s cheapest supermarket after it was bought by Walmart in 1999 and remains the third biggest in the country. But German-owned Aldi and Lidl have steadily cut into Asda’s market share. The two discounters started opening stores in the UK in 1990 and 1994, respectively, but their big breakthrough came when the economic crisis hit in 2008 and more shoppers were prepared to give them a go. Declining sales show signs of tapering off since Walmart veteran Sean Clarke became Asda’s president and chief executive last July, with a focus on improving the look and feel of the stores as well as enhancing product lines. Walmart will provide further firepower by ensuring Asda leverages the parent’s purchasing strength in everything from refrigerators to own-brand products and real estate to drive down prices and costs, said Scott Price, chief administrative officer of Walmart International. “One thing that maybe we would criticise ourselves for is that we didn’t start the repositioning of the business sooner, that we didn’t focus more on the leverage opportunities so that Asda was able to invest more aggressively in price,” Price told Reuters in an interview. Reuters Profits surge for Hargreaves Lansdown after Brexit shares frenzy Financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown has seen half-year profits surge by more than a fifth thanks to share dealing frenzy in the wake of the Brexit vote. The Bristol-based investment supermarket said it saw client-driven share deals jump by 51 per cent to 1.95 million in the six months after the EU referendum. It added there was no sign yet of a slowdown in share trading, as the so-called Trump Bump following the US president’s election continues to boost global stock markets. The share dealing boost helped pre-tax profits leap 21 per cent to £131m in the last six months of 2016, while the group also notched up another record for assets under administration – up 13 per cent since June 30 at £70bn. But the uncertainty caused by the decision last June to leave the EU also saw nervous investors withdraw cash and invest less, with net new business falling by 16 per cent in its first half, at £2.34bn against £2.77bn a year earlier. The group said it saw a “partial recovery” in investor confidence after the US presidential election, while it continues to benefit from an ongoing share dealing boom. PA IBM to Train 25 million Africans for free to build workforce IBM is ramping up its digital-skills training programme to accommodate as many as 25 million Africans in the next five years, looking toward building a future workforce on the continent. The US tech giant plans to make an initial investment of 945m rand ($70m) to roll out the training initiative in South Africa, a country where 31 per cent of 15-to-24 year-olds are unemployed, according to Statistics South Africa. At the same time, the programme will be started at IBM’s offices in Nigeria, Kenya, Morocco and Egypt, enabling an expansion of the project across the rest of the continent. The move may help bring and keep digital jobs in Africa instead of losing them to India, said Hamilton Ratshefola, IBM’s country manager for South Africa. As many as 50,000 such jobs are currently farmed out from Africa, predominantly to India, Ratshefola said. The company has worked in partnership with the United Nations in extending the initiative throughout Africa. IBM is also talking to a number of other potential partners, including mobile phone companies, to further scale the programme, Ratshefola said.  Bloomberg Dunelm slumps as retailer warns of ‘transitional year’  UK home furnishings retailer Dunelm reported a slide in first-half profit and indicated that the rest of the year may not be any easier, sending its shares tumbling. The company is in “a transitional year”, chief executive John Browett said in a statement on Wednesday. Dunelm shares fell as much as 11 per cent in London to the lowest in more than four years. Browett’s comment “sounds a bit ominous”, Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said in a note. “When you say that ‘this is a transitional year’, then it usually means that profits will be down.” The retailer, which has doubled its store numbers since going public just over a decade ago, is experiencing growing pains at a time when sterling’s Brexit-induced drop is causing it to raise prices and online competition is intensifying. Business in the first half of the year was “slightly softer than normal”, Browett said by phone, adding that conditions remain challenging. Bloomberg VW labour bosses accuse brand chief of breaking cost-cutting deal Volkswagen’s works council has accused top executives of breaching a cost-cutting deal, risking fresh turmoil at the German carmaker as it struggles to overcome its emissions scandal. In a letter to VW brand chief Herbert Diess, seen by Reuters, the labour leaders said he and personnel boss Karlheinz Blessing had breached the terms of November’s “future pact” by ruling out possible hirings in the first half of 2017 and cutting temporary jobs more quickly and deeply than agreed. “The management board with its actions is undermining the terms of the future pact,” the labour leaders said in the letter delivered to Diess on Tuesday. VW is under pressure to make cuts at high-cost operations in Germany to fund a shift to electric cars and mobility services in the wake of its emissions scandal, while still grappling with billions of euros in costs related to that scandal. Reuters Denmark joins race to host EU drug agency instead of London after Brexit The Danish government on Wednesday teamed up with the former head of drug company Novo Nordisk in its campaign to become the new host of the London-based European Medicines Agency (EMA) after Britain's vote to leave the European Union. “EMA should be situated in a place where there is a strong tradition of putting the patient in focus... We have that in Denmark,” said Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen in a statement. Denmark is not the only country courting to EMA and will compete with offers from other EU members including Sweden, Spain, France and Poland. Denmark is home to a cluster of pharmaceutical and biotech companies, including Novo Nordisk, the world’s largest diabetes drug maker, Lundbeck and Genmab. The government appointed former Novo Nordisk chief execuutive Lars Rebien Sorensen as a special envoy being tasked with promoting the Danish offer. Reuters Barcelona rejects Airbnb plan to limit rentals in fresh clash Barcelona’s city hall rejected a proposal by Airbnb to limit the number of home rentals in the city, setting off a fresh clash between the platform and local authorities vowing to clamp down on unregulated tourism. The city hall said the plan to limit home listings in the central Barcelona area of Ciutat Vella doesn’t go far in enough in tackling the use of unlicensed rentals for tourists. While Airbnb hoped the new limits would ease tensions after a year marred by sanctions and public backlash from locals complaining about crowds in central Barcelona, the city hall said Airbnb must stop advertising all properties without a licence while adding that it would keep sanctions against the home-rental platform unchanged. “Airbnb’s response is a joke,” said Agusti Colom, Barcelona’s councillor for companies and tourism, at a press conference on Tuesday after the plan was made public. “The law is clear. You can’t advertise tourist apartments on these platforms if they don’t have a licence number, so what Airbnb needs to do is to remove them.” Bloomberg EU fines 3 battery recycling companies for forming cartel  The European Union has fined three battery recycling companies a combined $72m (£57.5m) for forming a cartel that artificially kept the purchasing price for used car batteries low.  EU Antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said Wednesday the companies were purposely “reducing competition in this essential link of the recycling chain”.  The US company Johnson Controls received full immunity because it revealed the cartel to the EU, but British firm Eco-Bat Technologies was ordered to pay €32.7m (£28m) and Recyclex from France €2.7m. Campine of Belgium has to pay €8.1m.  The EU recycles practically all of its car batteries. By keeping the purchasing price low, the companies hurt used battery sellers, mainly small and medium-sized companies.  AP More about: GSK Glaxosmithkline Asda Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

Photo by Contributed Photo /Times Free Press. The one-time 'Sock Capital of the World,' Fort Payne, Ala., will soon get 442 new jobs making socks for Wal-Mart as part of the retailer's $250 million commitment to American manufacturing. The Renfro Corp., the single largest producer of socks in DeKalb County, Ala., recently landed a deal with Wal-Mart that should swell employment at Renfro's manufacturing plant in Fort Payne by more than 70 percent. The deal is the latest in Wal-Mart's 4-year-old commitment to buy an additional $250 billion worth of U.S. products to support American jobs, Wal-Mart spokesman Scott Markley said. "With changes in energy costs and labor costs overseas, it is increasingly cost effective and efficient to manufacture closest to the point of consumption," Markley said. "And it is just good business. Our customers tell us that where products are made is most important second only to price." The brands include Fruit of the Loom, Russell, Dr. Scholl's, and Faded Glory, among others. "They've been a supplier of socks to Wal-Mart for a very long time," Markley said. "They're sold under various brands." Renfro Corp. CEO Bud Kilby wasn't immediately available Wednesday. But county officials said Renfro now has about 605 employees, so the additional jobs will push employment for the hosiery mill to more than 1,000 workers. "Renfro is the largest employer in our hosiery industry," said Jimmy Durham, executive director of the DeKalb County Economic Development Authority. "We're also seeing an increase in sales and production from our other hosiery mills." While Wal-Mart's decision to stock more Renfro socks is a shot in the arm for Fort Payne, it still won't nudge the sock production numbers for the city, which has some 14,000 residents, back to the heyday. At its peak in the 1990s, Fort Payne had more than 120 hosiery mills with some 7,500 workers who made one out of every eight pairs of socks worn worldwide, according to a 2016 New York Times article. Fort Payne produced 600 million dozen pairs of socks at its peak, Durham said. Job loss accelerated after Gildan, a company based in Montreal, Canada, bought in 2007 V.I. Prewett & Son Inc., a homegrown hosiery mill and moved production elsewhere, including Honduras. "We lost at least 6,500 employees. Our unemployment spiked to about 16.9 percent," Durham said. "Now we're back down to about 5.9 percent unemployment," he said. "We've been very fortunate to get some good automotive and other companies." Dan Bartlett, Wal-Mart executive vice president for corporate affairs, said Wal-Mart is hiring more workers and buying more American goods as it expands its store network, e-commerce services and training for more than 225,000 frontline associates this year. "With a presence in thousands of communities and a vast supplier network, we know we play an important role in supporting and creating American jobs," Barlett said in a statement last month. "Our 2017 plans to grow our business — and our support for innovation in the textile industry — will have a meaningful impact across the country."

Walmart has upped its shareholding from 10.8 per cent to 12.1 per cent, just three months after almost doubling its stake in China’s second largest e-commerce player. The retailer secured its initial share of 5.9 per cent in June 2016 after selling its e-commerce business Yihaodian to JD.com in exchange for the shareholding as part of a strategic alliance between the two businesses. While Walmart operates bricks-and-mortar stores in China, investing in JD.com has given the retailer access to its logistics and warehousing across the country.       Comments (0) Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Sign up for free news updatesGo Popular news Read: LatestMost read 1Major landmark for T&G Global 2Florida orange volumes dip 3Japanese grape exports on the up 4New blueberry brand launches at Sainsbury's 5Strong mid-season figures for Vog 6USDA pumps funds into greening fight 7Walmart ups stake in JD.com, again 8Limoneira rolls out round citrus sales 9Biosecurity planning goes digital 10Mexican melons seek successful season 1Fukushima to promote produce in Tokyo 2China access in sight for CA strawberries 3Modi to feature at Fresh Produce India 4Fruit consumption hits 14-year low 5Record year for Australian citrus 6Aus closer to Japan/Thai access 7NZ cherry exports flying high 8Amazon moves on Indian FDI 9Eureka headed to Western Australia 10Walmart ups stake in JD.com, again Upcoming Events March to May 2017 Global Berry Congress ROTTERDAM (The Netherlands) 27-29 March 2017 Fresh Produce India MUMBAI (India) 27-28 April 2017 FPJ Live - The UK Fruit & Vegetable Congress Belfry Hotel & Resort, Birmingham (United Kingdom) 4 May 2017  Keep informed...  Twitter  Blog  Podcasts  Video  RSS Feed  Instagram Sign up for free news updatesGo Features & Analysis Online dating for fresh produce They describe themselves as the matchmakers of fresh produce – but what does this latest wave of fruit and veg e-commerce platforms offer suppliers?

Senate Bill 284, which was filed on Monday and given a committee “do-pass” recommendation on Tuesday, was approved by the full Senate after several lawmakers said they’ve been inundated with emails and phone calls from a second group of liquor store owners who said they were caught by surprise by the bill. SB284 sponsor Sen. Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, defended the bill as consumer-friendly legislation that will enable grocery stores to obtain permits to sell wines of all types. Currently, grocery store chains operating in Arkansas, such as Walmart U.S., Kroger’s, Edwards Food Giant and Brookshire’s, can only sell Arkansas and other small farm wines that produce less than 250,000 gallons of vinous product year. “This is a bill that the Grocers Store Association has been working on since 2015. There were some concerns then and they pulled it down and worked on it with different areas of the wine industry in the state of Arkansas for two years now,” Hester said. “This is a simple change to allow the grocery stores to carry the product and brands that best suits their customers (needs).” Sens. Linda Collins-Smith, R-Pocahontas, and Joyce Elliott, D-Little Rock, peppered Hester with several questions about why the bill was pushed through committee so quickly without input from a group of liquor store operators who said they were not involved in negotiations before HB284 was filed. Elliott also questioned Hester concerning a one-page missive circulating at the State Capitol by opponents of SB284 that grocery stores and other retailers won’t have to abide by the same rules and restrictions that now govern liquor stores, such as store setback rules on the distance from school and churches and prohibitions that prevent most wine retailers from selling groceries. Hester testified he was well aware that some liquor store owners were upset with his bill, but said his legislation would open up the state’s liquor industry to “free market” principles. He also dismissed concerns that Walmart and other “big box” grocery store chains would have an unfair advantage in obtaining volume price discount on out-of-state wines, and offering food products at wine tasting events that liquor stores can’t. “Some factions of the liquor store owners (will) support this bill, others will not,” Hester said. “Today, if the liquor stores want to pass bills where they can sell crackers, I would be supportive of that.” After a few other questions about other details of the six-page bill, the Senate approved the bill by a vote of 18-11. Three senators voted present and two did not vote. Afterward, members of a newly-created group of about 400 liquor store owners from across the state, called United Beverage Retailers of Arkansas (UBRA), said Hester bill’s caught them off-guard. Tom Smith, owner of Spirits Liquor in Little Rock, said two years ago the liquor stores and small wineries across the state were solidly united against a similar bill. He said Walmart and the grocery groups only sought out a few “county-line” and dry county liquor store owners to help pen Hester’s bill. “We were not invited to the table. (This) really took me out of the blue … and got me by surprise, I did not know that these discussions were going on,” Smith said. “Last time around two years ago, we had the wineries on our side and we had all the county line liquor stores. They took those two groups right away from us.” Francois Guilloux, owner of There Performance Group, a Little Rock-based data analytics and consulting firm for the liquor store industry, told Talk Business & Politics that SB284 will negatively impact smaller, independent liquor stores across Arkansas. “This bill will have devastating impacts on the wine and spirits industry in Arkansas,” said Guilloux, who has sent hundreds of emails to liquor store owners and lawmakers. “We estimate that close to $80 million of cash flow is in jeopardy for a group of 1,000 small businesses and over 2,000 jobs are at risk in Arkansas.” Supporters of SB284 say the independent liquor store owners are exaggerating the economic impact of SB284, citing how similar legislation in Tennessee, Florida and other states allow retail sales of wine. During a bill signing ceremony on the other side of the State Capitol on Wednesday, Gov. Asa Hutchinson refused to jump into the fray, saying he would remain “neutral” on SB284 and “the interested parties should seek some common ground.” “When you have those competing interests, I was counting on them communicating and talking and working out consensus. I think they thought they had a consensus bill that they were presenting,” the governor said. “We are continuing to monitor that. We are hearing from some people that had some concerns about it, so we will continue to watch that as it goes through the process.” Hutchinson said lawmakers need to balance any “competing interest” between all the interested parties. “The legislation tries to do, (but) we will see if there needs to be modifications as it goes through the legislature,” he said. Late Wednesday evening, Hester’s bill was on the agenda of the House Select Committee on Rules, which generally deals with all legislation concerning alcohol, cigarettes, tobacco, lobbying, code of ethics, pari-mutuel betting and other similar bills. One particular note discussed by some lawmakers interested in SB284 is the potential revenue that it would generate from increased wine sales. In Hester’s bill, a grocery store seeking a wine permit would pay $1,000 for building space of less than 35,001 square feet. Larger stores with space over 75,000 square feet would pay $5,000 for wine permits. According to the bill, fees from the wine permits would be equally divided between the “Arkansas Wine Grant” program and the Tourism Development Trust Fund, which would be designated to the Department of Parks and Tourism to promote the state’s wine industry.

REUTERS/Eddie Keogh 21/21 By James Davey | LONDON LONDON Wal-Mart (WMT.N) is throwing its weight as the world's largest retailer behind its struggling British arm Asda after admitting it was too slow to respond effectively to the threat posed by the discount supermarkets. Asda thrived for a decade as Britain's cheapest supermarket after it was bought by Wal-Mart in 1999 and remains the third-biggest in the country. But German-owned Aldi [ALDIEI.UL] and Lidl [LIDUK.UL] have steadily cut into Asda's market share. The two discounters started opening stores in the UK in 1990 and 1994, respectively, but their big breakthrough came when the economic crisis hit in 2008 and more British shoppers were prepared to give them a go. Declining sales show signs of tapering off since Wal-Mart veteran Sean Clarke became Asda's president and chief executive last July, with a focus on improving the look and feel of the stores as well as enhancing product lines. Wal-Mart will provide further firepower by ensuring Asda leverages the parent's purchasing strength in everything from refrigerators to own-brand products and real estate to drive down prices and costs, said Scott Price, chief administrative officer of Walmart International. "One thing that maybe we would criticise ourselves for is that we didn't start the repositioning of the business sooner, that we didn't focus more on the leverage opportunities so that Asda was able to invest more aggressively in price," Price told Reuters in an interview. "What Sean is able to do with his global experience at Wal-Mart is to know what levers to pull," he said, in a reference to Clarke's time with Wal-Mart in Japan, Canada and most recently as chief executive in China. Working more closely with its parent, Asda will be able to market more Wal-Mart brands as its own at a lower price than rivals, Price said. "He's able to pull private (Wal-Mart) brands and put an Asda brand on it that is equal to the national brand in the UK in terms of quality and sensory, but at a price that no one else can match," he said of Clarke. In return, Wal-Mart was looking for more ways to exploit the areas where Asda has excelled, for example with a popular olive oil originally sourced by Asda and now sold across the group, including in the United States and 10 other international markets. PERFORMANCE SLUMPED From its headquarters in Leeds in northern England, Asda claimed to be the first of Britain's major grocers -- which also includes market leader Tesco (TSCO.L), No. 2 Sainsbury's (SBRY.L) and No. 4 Morrisons (MRW.L) -- to spot the threat from the discounters. With fewer stores in the more affluent southeast of England than its rivals and the vast majority of its business in the large stores that have become less fashionable in recent years, Asda was most exposed. After it lost its price advantage and failed to offer other reasons to shop there, performance slumped. Wal-Mart added to Asda's problems by diverting key executives from Britain to the United States and focusing too much on cutting costs and maximising short-term profit at the expense of investing to protect market share, analysts said. The result has been nine straight quarters of underlying sales decline since the middle of 2014, which translated into a more than 1 percentage point loss in market share, according to researcher Kantar Worldpanel. Its share currently stands at 15.6 percent, versus more than 28 percent for Tesco. David Cheesewright, CEO of Walmart International, in June expressed disappointment at Asda's weak performance and said it would shift from protecting profit to protecting market share. The data shows signs of improving. In November Asda reported a like-for-like sales decline of 5.8 percent for the third quarter to Sept. 30, compared to the second quarter when it reported a fall of 7.5 percent, its worst drop in quarterly sales. A further material improvement is expected when it reports fourth quarter sales on Feb. 21, with analysts forecasting a decline of 2-3 percent. Monthly industry data has also shown a better performance over Christmas and January. While sales fell 1.9 percent year-on-year by value in the 12 weeks to Jan. 29, according to Kantar, Asda increased the number of shoppers visiting its stores. The improvements reflect the early work of Clarke and former Sainsbury’s executive Roger Burnley, who joined as chief operating officer in October, analysts said. That includes making Asda stores cleaner and less cluttered, with more staff on the shop floor and better availability of fresh produce and meat -- key ranges that either drive customers into stores or, if you get them wrong, out. Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital, said there are also signs that Asda is stepping up product innovation with, for example, new items in the frozen and chilled areas and in its “Extra Special” premium brand. At the same time Asda has developed complementary services and partners within its stores, such as with sports retailer Decathlon and butcher McGee's, while more freedom is being given to individual managers when it comes to the layout of their stores. NO RECOVERY TIMELINE It looks likely to be a long road to recovery, however. "Things are going a bit better but they're going a bit better from a catastrophic level of performance," one senior UK retail industry executive told Reuters, asking not to be named. "Everybody thinks you can turn around a business in a year or two and you can't. This is a five-year project," he said. He questioned whether Wal-Mart would provide the necessary investment. "Their instinct is to save their way to victory." Price said Wal-Mart was committed to Asda and has tasked Clarke with building a sustainable business model. While Asda has said it will cut prices equating to 1.5 billion pounds of savings to the customer over five years from November 2013, washing through at about 300 million pounds a year, Price declined to say what additional investment was required in the stores. "We are making very solid progress, (but) there's no timeline (for recovery)," he said.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    A group of prominent Republicans and business leaders backing a tax on carbon dioxide were taking their case Wednesday to top White House aides, including chief economic adviser Gary Cohn. The group, including former Treasury Secretaries Hank Paulson and James Baker, is pressing President Donald Trump to tax carbon dioxide in exchange for abolishing a slew of environmental regulations. They unveiled their plan with a press conference in Washington and an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. "We know we have an uphill slog to get Republicans interested in this," Baker said before heading to the White House. But "a conservative, free-market approach is a very Republican way of approaching the problem." Other possible attendees at the meeting include the president’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, who weighed climate change policy during the campaign, and Vice President Mike Pence. The Republican and business leaders, calling themselves the Climate Leadership Council, lend their stature to an approach for addressing climate change that mirrors an idea already advanced by Exxon Mobil Corp. Supporters say the tax is a conservative solution to climate change that replaces a regulatory regime with a free-market approach for addressing the greenhouse gas emissions. Wal-Mart Founder Paulson, who served as Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush, previously has advocated a carbon tax through his eponymous think tank, the Paulson Institute. Baker, who served as secretary of state and Treasury secretary under two Republican administrations, as well as former Secretary of State George Shultz, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. founder Rob Walton and Sequoia Capital Operations LLC partner Thomas Stephenson, among others. Economic advisers to former presidents George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan also are involved in the effort. "Climate change poses an unacceptable risk to our climate and to our economy," Paulson said in a statement. "Putting a price on carbon is by far the most efficient and effective way to restrict emissions." Baker himself conceded he remains "somewhat of a skeptic about the extent to which man is responsible for climate change" but the "risks are too great to ignore." The plan faces strong political headwinds; both Trump and a majority of the House of Representatives have come out against a carbon tax in the past year. Trump also has pledged to do away with environmental regulations limiting emissions of carbon dioxide But the idea of a carbon tax, long favored by economists as the most straightforward way to address climate change, could gain traction as part of a broad tax overhaul on Capitol Hill. Carbon Pricing Spreads Along With Debate About Payoff: QuickTake The blueprint involves a $40 tax on every metric ton of carbon dioxide released by burning fossil fuels, with the price climbing over time. To avoid an undue burden on the poor from the higher energy bills that would result, the projected $200 billion to $300 billion in annual revenue would be redistributed to households in the form of quarterly checks from the Social Security Administration. Families of four would see an average annual payout of $2,000 under the plan. The proposal also calls for border adjustments that would act to hike the costs of products imported from countries that do not put a price on carbon. Martin Feldstein, who headed former President Ronald Reagan’s Council of Economic Advisers, said the tax would be imposed at the point fossil fuels enter the economy, such as when oil leaves the refinery or coal leaves the mine. "The tax at the source is then built in to the prices of the products made from that raw material," Feldstein said. Romney Tweet Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney described the proposal in a tweet as a "thought-provoking plan from highly respected conservatives to both strengthen the economy and confront climate risks." The group envisions the carbon tax taking the place of an array of Obama-era environmental regulations that raise the cost of fossil fuels. The centerpiece of President Barack Obama’s climate agenda, the Clean Power Plan slashing emissions from electricity, would be immediately repealed, while others would be phased out over time. U.S. companies emitting carbon dioxide also could win liability protections under the deal.  The idea dovetails with an approach advocated by some large integrated oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, which has promoted a revenue-neutral carbon tax instead of a patchwork of environmental regulations. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Exxon’s former chief executive, previously acknowledged the climate is changing and described a carbon tax as the most efficient means of embedding its cost in economic decisions stretching from oil companies to consumers. Oil Companies BP Plc has said a well-constructed carbon tax or cap-and-trade system would encourage energy producers and consumers to pare emissions, while Royal Dutch Shell Plc Chairman Charles Holliday has called a carbon tax the most effective and practical way of driving that change. It is unclear how the new plan will be received by Republicans in the White House and on Capitol Hill.  The Republican-led House last June approved a non-binding resolution condemning the idea of a carbon tax as "detrimental to American families and businesses." The measure, which passed 237-163, was designed to lock in lawmakers’ positions, making it harder for those who lodged a vote opposing a tax to support one later on. Trump has come out against the idea, rejecting a carbon tax in responses to a survey by the American Energy Alliance last March. Many of the conservative advocates guiding Trump’s energy and environment policy also eschew the idea. The approach also runs counter to Trump’s campaign promise to help bring back coal mining jobs. Because it generates more carbon dioxide emissions than natural gas and oil, coal would be the fossil fuel hardest hit by a tax on carbon. Opponents fear that with the foundation laid now, lawmakers could seize on a carbon tax as a potent source of revenue to offset rate reductions during a future congressional debate on overhauling the tax code. "This is not a climate proposal; it’s a tax proposal," said Thomas Pyle, head of the free-market advocacy group American Energy Alliance. "There’s no need to trade Obama’s climate regulations for a carbon tax. Donald Trump has already promised to undo them." The idea of scuttling carbon dioxide regulations also is a non-starter with many environmentalists who could be critical to advancing the tax idea. “We have a moral obligation to protect future generations from the growing dangers of climate change,” said Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Effective action means building on the progress we’re already making — not sacrificing those gains by weakening the laws Congress has already passed.” But a carbon tax has gained traction in some circles. Republican Bob Inglis, a former representative from South Carolina, has pitched the tax as a free-market solution to climate change. Tesla Inc. founder Elon Musk also has pressed the Trump administration on the issue. It could benefit his electric vehicle business by driving more consumers away from gasoline-fueled automobiles. The issue divides the oil industry; though Exxon Mobil is just one of several large integrated companies that favor a carbon tax, the idea is opposed by many independent producers that do not own pipeline and refining operations.   © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/filesMore By James Davey LONDON (Reuters) - Wal-Mart <WMT.N> is throwing its weight as the world's largest retailer behind its struggling British arm Asda after admitting it was too slow to respond effectively to the threat posed by the discount supermarkets. Asda thrived for a decade as Britain's cheapest supermarket after it was bought by Wal-Mart in 1999 and remains the third-biggest in the country. But German-owned Aldi [ALDIEI.UL] and Lidl [LIDUK.UL] have steadily cut into Asda's market share. The two discounters started opening stores in the UK in 1990 and 1994, respectively, but their big breakthrough came when the economic crisis hit in 2008 and more British shoppers were prepared to give them a go. Declining sales show signs of tapering off since Wal-Mart veteran Sean Clarke became Asda's president and chief executive last July, with a focus on improving the look and feel of the stores as well as enhancing product lines. Wal-Mart will provide further firepower by ensuring Asda leverages the parent's purchasing strength in everything from refrigerators to own-brand products and real estate to drive down prices and costs, said Scott Price, chief administrative officer of Walmart International. "One thing that maybe we would criticize ourselves for is that we didn't start the repositioning of the business sooner, that we didn't focus more on the leverage opportunities so that Asda was able to invest more aggressively in price," Price told Reuters in an interview. "What Sean is able to do with his global experience at Wal-Mart is to know what levers to pull," he said, in a reference to Clarke's time with Wal-Mart in Japan, Canada and most recently as chief executive in China. Working more closely with its parent, Asda will be able to market more Wal-Mart brands as its own at a lower price than rivals, Price said. "He's able to pull private (Wal-Mart) brands and put an Asda brand on it that is equal to the national brand in the UK in terms of quality and sensory, but at a price that no one else can match," he said of Clarke. In return, Wal-Mart was looking for more ways to exploit the areas where Asda has excelled, for example with a popular olive oil originally sourced by Asda and now sold across the group, including in the United States and 10 other international markets. PERFORMANCE SLUMPED From its headquarters in Leeds in northern England, Asda claimed to be the first of Britain's major grocers -- which also includes market leader Tesco <TSCO.L>, No. 2 Sainsbury's <SBRY.L> and No. 4 Morrisons <MRW.L> -- to spot the threat from the discounters. With fewer stores in the more affluent southeast of England than its rivals and the vast majority of its business in the large stores that have become less fashionable in recent years, Asda was most exposed. After it lost its price advantage and failed to offer other reasons to shop there, performance slumped. Wal-Mart added to Asda's problems by diverting key executives from Britain to the United States and focusing too much on cutting costs and maximizing short-term profit at the expense of investing to protect market share, analysts said. The result has been nine straight quarters of underlying sales decline since the middle of 2014, which translated into a more than 1 percentage point loss in market share, according to researcher Kantar Worldpanel. Its share currently stands at 15.6 percent, versus more than 28 percent for Tesco. David Cheesewright, CEO of Walmart International, in June expressed disappointment at Asda's weak performance and said it would shift from protecting profit to protecting market share. The data shows signs of improving. In November Asda reported a like-for-like sales decline of 5.8 percent for the third quarter to Sept. 30, compared to the second quarter when it reported a fall of 7.5 percent, its worst drop in quarterly sales. A further material improvement is expected when it reports fourth quarter sales on Feb. 21, with analysts forecasting a decline of 2-3 percent. Monthly industry data has also shown a better performance over Christmas and January. While sales fell 1.9 percent year-on-year by value in the 12 weeks to Jan. 29, according to Kantar, Asda increased the number of shoppers visiting its stores. The improvements reflect the early work of Clarke and former Sainsbury’s executive Roger Burnley, who joined as chief operating officer in October, analysts said. That includes making Asda stores cleaner and less cluttered, with more staff on the shop floor and better availability of fresh produce and meat -- key ranges that either drive customers into stores or, if you get them wrong, out. Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital, said there are also signs that Asda is stepping up product innovation with, for example, new items in the frozen and chilled areas and in its “Extra Special” premium brand. At the same time Asda has developed complementary services and partners within its stores, such as with sports retailer Decathlon and butcher McGee's, while more freedom is being given to individual managers when it comes to the layout of their stores.

"Their instinct is to save their way to victory." Price said Wal-Mart was committed to Asda and has tasked Clarke with building a sustainable business model. While Asda has said it will cut prices equating to 1.5 billion pounds of savings to the customer over five years from November 2013, washing through at about 300 million pounds a year, Price declined to say what additional investment was required in the stores. "We are making very solid progress, (but) there's no timeline (for recovery)," he said.

REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo 22/22 By James Davey | LONDON LONDON Wal-Mart (WMT.N) is throwing its weight as the world's largest retailer behind its struggling British arm Asda after admitting it was too slow to respond effectively to the threat posed by the discount supermarkets. Asda thrived for a decade as Britain's cheapest supermarket after it was bought by Wal-Mart in 1999 and remains the third-biggest in the country. But German-owned Aldi [ALDIEI.UL] and Lidl [LIDUK.UL] have steadily cut into Asda's market share. The two discounters started opening stores in the UK in 1990 and 1994, respectively, but their big breakthrough came when the economic crisis hit in 2008 and more British shoppers were prepared to give them a go. Declining sales show signs of tapering off since Wal-Mart veteran Sean Clarke became Asda's president and chief executive last July, with a focus on improving the look and feel of the stores as well as enhancing product lines. Wal-Mart will provide further firepower by ensuring Asda leverages the parent's purchasing strength in everything from refrigerators to own-brand products and real estate to drive down prices and costs, said Scott Price, chief administrative officer of Walmart International. "One thing that maybe we would criticize ourselves for is that we didn't start the repositioning of the business sooner, that we didn't focus more on the leverage opportunities so that Asda was able to invest more aggressively in price," Price told Reuters in an interview. "What Sean is able to do with his global experience at Wal-Mart is to know what levers to pull," he said, in a reference to Clarke's time with Wal-Mart in Japan, Canada and most recently as chief executive in China. Working more closely with its parent, Asda will be able to market more Wal-Mart brands as its own at a lower price than rivals, Price said. "He's able to pull private (Wal-Mart) brands and put an Asda brand on it that is equal to the national brand in the UK in terms of quality and sensory, but at a price that no one else can match," he said of Clarke. In return, Wal-Mart was looking for more ways to exploit the areas where Asda has excelled, for example with a popular olive oil originally sourced by Asda and now sold across the group, including in the United States and 10 other international markets. PERFORMANCE SLUMPED From its headquarters in Leeds in northern England, Asda claimed to be the first of Britain's major grocers -- which also includes market leader Tesco (TSCO.L), No. 2 Sainsbury's (SBRY.L) and No. 4 Morrisons (MRW.L) -- to spot the threat from the discounters. With fewer stores in the more affluent southeast of England than its rivals and the vast majority of its business in the large stores that have become less fashionable in recent years, Asda was most exposed. After it lost its price advantage and failed to offer other reasons to shop there, performance slumped. Wal-Mart added to Asda's problems by diverting key executives from Britain to the United States and focusing too much on cutting costs and maximizing short-term profit at the expense of investing to protect market share, analysts said. The result has been nine straight quarters of underlying sales decline since the middle of 2014, which translated into a more than 1 percentage point loss in market share, according to researcher Kantar Worldpanel. Its share currently stands at 15.6 percent, versus more than 28 percent for Tesco. David Cheesewright, CEO of Walmart International, in June expressed disappointment at Asda's weak performance and said it would shift from protecting profit to protecting market share. The data shows signs of improving. In November Asda reported a like-for-like sales decline of 5.8 percent for the third quarter to Sept. 30, compared to the second quarter when it reported a fall of 7.5 percent, its worst drop in quarterly sales. A further material improvement is expected when it reports fourth quarter sales on Feb. 21, with analysts forecasting a decline of 2-3 percent. Monthly industry data has also shown a better performance over Christmas and January. While sales fell 1.9 percent year-on-year by value in the 12 weeks to Jan. 29, according to Kantar, Asda increased the number of shoppers visiting its stores. The improvements reflect the early work of Clarke and former Sainsbury’s executive Roger Burnley, who joined as chief operating officer in October, analysts said. That includes making Asda stores cleaner and less cluttered, with more staff on the shop floor and better availability of fresh produce and meat -- key ranges that either drive customers into stores or, if you get them wrong, out. Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital, said there are also signs that Asda is stepping up product innovation with, for example, new items in the frozen and chilled areas and in its “Extra Special” premium brand. At the same time Asda has developed complementary services and partners within its stores, such as with sports retailer Decathlon and butcher McGee's, while more freedom is being given to individual managers when it comes to the layout of their stores. NO RECOVERY TIMELINE It looks likely to be a long road to recovery, however. "Things are going a bit better but they're going a bit better from a catastrophic level of performance," one senior UK retail industry executive told Reuters, asking not to be named. "Everybody thinks you can turn around a business in a year or two and you can't. This is a five-year project," he said. He questioned whether Wal-Mart would provide the necessary investment. "Their instinct is to save their way to victory." Price said Wal-Mart was committed to Asda and has tasked Clarke with building a sustainable business model. While Asda has said it will cut prices equating to 1.5 billion pounds of savings to the customer over five years from November 2013, washing through at about 300 million pounds a year, Price declined to say what additional investment was required in the stores. "We are making very solid progress, (but) there's no timeline (for recovery)," he said.

Some Wall Street Analysts Are Saying Yes Bernstein On Broadline, Hardline Retail: Target, Dollar General Favored Stocks Close At Record Highs; Nike Leads Dow (Investor's Business Daily) This article was originally published on Motif Investing. Traditionally viewed as a safe haven for investors during tough economic times, discounters are emerging as a portfolio insurance policy during good times, as well. Over the past year, middle-class retail bastions like Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT), Ross Stores (NASDAQ: ROST), Big Lots (NYSE: BIG) and Dollar General (NYSE: DG) have posted strong gains; higher wages and a strong employment outlook are likely to push retail sales higher in 2017. The last severe downturn, the Great Recession of 2007-09, shaved $16.4 trillion from U.S. household wealth – almost enough money to fuel the entire economy for a year. Real unemployment soared past 16 percent, and almost 3 in 4 Americans surveyed said they had either lost a job or knew a family member or close friend who had become unemployed. A 2010 Pew Research Center study found that more than 60 percent of Americans had cut back on spending, and 1 in 3 said they planned to spend less after the recession ended. They apparently stayed true to their word; while a slow recovery favored wealthy consumers, middle-class Americans who had been forced to shop at discounters by economic circumstance remained there by habit. Sales at Dollar General and Family Dollar rose more than 25 percent between 2010 and 2013. The 800-Pound Gorilla As the planet’s largest retailer, the Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart would seem to be a prime candidate to reflect the state of the economy. Yet in the depths of the Great Recession, the company’s same-store sales – a key indicator — rose more than 5 percent annually at its 5,000 U.S. stores. A 2011 University of California-Berkeley study found the average customer had spent $43.95 per visit, making 27 trips to Wal-Mart each year. While Wal-Mart isn’t a pure discounter, its sheer size has continued to attract bargain-hunters and people on limited incomes. Although the U.S. Department of Agriculture is considering appealing a South Dakota court ruling that it release individual store revenues for its Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, the company estimated that it received about 18 percent of the $80 billion program in 2013. The number of food stamp recipients has decreased slightly over the last three years to 43.5 million people, but 1 of every 6 American households still requires government help to buy food. Wal-Mart shares have increased about 10 percent over the last year, outpacing gains enjoyed by competitors such as Target (NYSE: TGT) and Costco (NASDAQ: COST). The retailer is in the process of cutting roughly 1,000 corporate jobs and shut 269 stores last year, in part to focus on increasing its online presence. Finally, the company is in the midst of a two-year, $20 billion stock buyback plan that can only boost share value. Twenty-eight of 31 analysts covering the company rate the stock as a hold or buy. Dollar Values At the other end of the discount spectrum are retailers such as Dollar General, Big Lots and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR). Shares of all three have made modest gains over the last year, but the big story may be that many analysts believe there’s still room for growth. In the heart of the Great Recession, Dollar Tree stock traded around $10.50; lately, a share is valued at roughly $75. Big Lots has soared from $17.50 to almost $50 during the same time, and Dollar General shares have more than doubled, rising to $71 per share from about $22 during the worst of the downturn. Although its average 7,400-square-foot size is dwarfed by Wal-Mart, Dollar General has one surprising advantage. After adding 900 stores in 2016 and remodeling another 900, it has plans to add 1,000 more locations this year, bringing its U.S. total to almost 15,000 locations. And for investors who are leery of the Goodlettsville, Tenn.-based company’s estimates of 7 to 10 percent annual growth, they can take comfort in the company’s record of 26 consecutive years of increases in same-store sales. Dollar Tree, based in Chesapeake, Virginia, has also expanded rapidly, growing to almost 14,000 stores after it beat out Dollar General in 2015 to acquire Family Dollar in an $8.5 billion deal. While such huge mergers can often depress share values because of the large amounts of debt required, investors have punished the company; its stock has remained more or less even during the last year. A much smaller chain with fewer than 1,500 stores, the Columbus, Ohio-based Big Lots, hasn’t had problems with flat share prices. Over the past year, its stock has shot up 40 percent. While its revenue figures haven’t been rising, analysts see the company’s decision to close many of its under-performing stores as a step in the right direction, and the consensus estimate sees Big Lots stock rising from its current level of $49 per share to $54.50. Off-Price, On Target The off-price retail segment of the discount market is performing well, also. Off-price retailers primarily sell irregular items, closeouts, end of season, overrun and other merchandise before selling it at discount. Shares of TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX), the Framingham, Mass.-based retailer whose stores include T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and Home Goods, have risen more than 10 percent over the last year. Ross Stores, headquartered in Pleasanton, Calif., has posted an almost 30 percent gain for the 12-month period. TJX, which has about 3,600 stores worldwide, plans to expand to 5,600 locations over the long term, according to its chief executive. Ross, which has more than 1,300 stores, also is working on an expansion plan that could increase its presence to 2,500 stores. While online titans such as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) have hurt middle-income retail bastions such as Macy’s, Ross and TJX stores have boomed because of the value to consumers. Instead of having to wait for sales at department stores, consumers know they’ll be able to buy clothes at a discount. “It’s more like treasure hunting,” a shopper explained recently to the Chicago Tribune.

The larger supercenters employ about 300 people.  Construction began on May 25, 2016. It signaled the end of a long, pre-construction legal battle between the Bentonville, Ark.-based company and a local group calling itself BOW NOT -- Back Off Wal-Mart, Not Our Town.   BOW NOT and those who filed the lawsuit -- not all of them close neighbors of the proposed development -- claimed the township's approval of Wal-Mart in August 2013 injured them in several ways.  Whitehall Township planners approve Wal-Mart site plan on 5-0 vote, but issue is far from settled  The store will offer a full line of fresh produce, general merchandise including health and beauty items, baby and pet supplies, toys and games, electronics, sporting goods, apparel and household items.   A full-service pharmacy with drive-thru, vision center, money center, digital photo-processing center and Wal-Mart pickup will also be at the location.   Wal-Mart has more than 33,000 employees in Michigan, according to the release. During 2016, the company promoted 5,800 associates in the state, and 3,185 were converted from part-time to full-time.  Nationwide, Wal-Mart has hired more than 120,000 veterans through its Veterans Welcome Home Commitment, which began Memorial Day 2013, according to the release. The company will offer a job to any eligible U.S. veteran honorably discharged from active duty.  Veterans can find more information here.   Wal-Mart offers a benefits program to eligible full- and part-time employees, including health, matching 401(k) contributions, discounts, stock purchasing, life insurance and quarterly cash bonuses based on store performance, according to the release.   Michigan's Best 'They deserve it' - community rallies around Michigan's Best Bowling Alley Michigan's Best Bowling Alley: Top 10 revealed Michigan's Best bowling alley is in Fowler: E-Lanes Guide to all Michigan's Best searches Complete coverage » Find Local Homes for Sale Apartments Car Dealers Used Cars Jobs Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries Connect with MLive Subscribe to our newsletters Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Most Read Active Discussions About Us MLive Media Group Our Team Advertise Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us Jobs at MLive Subscriptions Newspaper | Digital Editions | eNewsletters The Ann Arbor News The Bay City Times The Flint Journal The Grand Rapids Press Jackson Citizen Patriot Kalamazoo Gazette Muskegon Chronicle The Saginaw News MLive Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Apartment Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Business Resource Center Your Regional News Pages Ann Arbor Bay City Detroit Flint Grand Rapids Jackson Kalamazoo Lansing Muskegon Saginaw Mobile Mobile apps | Tablet apps More on MLive Photos Video Weather Post a job Post a free classified ad Sell your car Sell/Rent your home Apartments and Rentals Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | YouTube Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 MLive Media Group.

Felix A. Tejeda, 35, allegedly fabricated stories of the victim’s relatives’ arrests while requesting the victims wire transfer money to him for bail. Then he’d pick up the money at Wal-Mart in Hometown until Rush Township police and store employees apprehended him Jan. 31. He faces three counts each theft by unlawful taking, access device fraud, theft by deception and identity theft — all third-degree felonies. Tejeda was arraigned the day of his capture by Magisterial District Judge Stephen Bayer, Tamaqua, who set bail at $25,000. Unable to post the money, he was taken to jail. Law enforcement in Ithaca, Michigan, contacted Rush Township police Jan. 13 stating a male contacted a couple in Michigan claiming he was a legal aide in Pennsylvania and that their grandson was involved in an accident and needed $5,000 bail, according to arrest papers. The male gave the victims the names of two bail bondsmen and told them they would have to wire $2,500 from two different Wal-Mart stores since the company only allows a person to receive $2,500 per day. As instructed, the victims sent the $5,000 in separate transactions from stores in the towns of Alma and St. Johns, police wrote, but when they got in touch with their grandson later that day they found they were duped. Knowing then that their grandson wasn’t in trouble in Pennsylvania, they contacted their local police. The couple managed to cancel one of the transactions but by the time they found out they were being scammed the first transaction had already been picked up at Wal-Mart in Hometown by Tejeda, who used a fake identification card, court papers state. Then on Jan. 26, an employee from the Hometown store contacted Rush Township police stating a 75-year-old woman from North Carolina just wired $2,500 to a male and it seemed similar to the Jan. 13 scam. Police received a photograph of the male picking up that money and later identified him as Tejeda — the same male pictured in video surveillance in the previous scam, police said. Rush Township police were back at the store Jan. 31 for another incident when a store employee told them the male committing the frauds was in the store again, completing another $2,500 transaction from a Nebraska woman, court records state. The officer took Tejeda into custody, finding him in possession of an Illinois driver’s license with a fake name and Tejeda’s photo and birthdate. Rush Township Police Chief Joe Lipsett said Tejeda invoked his right to an attorney so police weren’t able to interview him and are unsure if he committed other similar crimes. Upon his apprehension, police did retrieve the $2,500 he allegedly bilked from his latest victim, Lipsett said. The chief said the arrest resulted from good police work by Patrolman Ryan Oldt, who investigated and obtained Tejeda’s picture so police were able to identify him despite him using fake identities. “It was good police work by the officer here,” Lipsett said. He said officers will do what they can to resolve any crimes being committed. The arrest also serves as a educational tool to keep other victims from falling prey to similar schemes. Lipsett said before ever sending money for bail, people should try to contact the family member in question and/or other relatives to ensure the person is actually in jail. Lipsett suggested people also contact the jail where the person is reportedly being held, the court office the case supposedly was heard, and even their local police departments to find out if the claims and phone calls are legitimate. Locally, he said, bail requests are often made from a district judge’s office or from a jail. Residents should be aware that scammers often do “extensive” research on people to find out intimate details about their families before preying on them. achristman@standardspeaker.com We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.

(WLS) WLS Tuesday, February 07, 2017 10:43PM PALATINE, Ill. (WLS) -- Police said a man was found shot in the parking lot of a Walmart in northwest suburban Palatine Tuesday night. Police said they received the reports around 7:30 p.m. to the store in the 1500-block of Rand Road. Police said they found a 19-year-old male victim who had sustained one gunshot wound. The victim was conscious and able to provide information to officers, police said, and was taken to Lutheran General Hospital for treatment. Witnesses told the police the shooter or shooters may be inside the store, but police said a search of the store indicated they were no longer at the scene. In the parking lot police checked for bullet holes in parked cars and shell casings. Witnesses said shots rang out in the parking lot, sending people running for cover. Customers were upset, saying there's gang activity in that area. A Walmart spokesperson said no one inside was injured and the store remained open to customers. Palatine police remained on the scene, piecing together the circumstances of the shooting. Related Topics: newsshootingwalmartPalatine Email share share tweet email (Copyright ©2017 WLS-TV.

A 75-year-old man is in critical condition after driving his vehicle off the roadway and into a pond near the Brainerd Wal-Mart late Tuesday afternoon. Battalion Chief Rick Boatwright with the Chattanooga Fire Department said the man was leaving the Wal-Mart and traveling north on Greenway View Drive when he drove off the roadway and down an embankment to the water below. When responders arrived, the car was completely submerged and upside down. Firefighters clambered down the embankment, climbed on top of the car and attached a winch, which was used to pull the vehicle onto its side to so they could see the driver. Once the vehicle had been raised partially, firefighters broke one of the windows and pulled the unconscious man out of the car. Firefighters immediately began administering cardio pulmonary resuscitation, according to a fire department news release. It has not been reported how long the man was underwater before responders arrived. Paramedics with Hamilton County Emergency Services took the man to Erlanger hospital. Two of the firefighters rode with the victim in the ambulance and continued CPR. The man's identity has not been revealed. Crews were able to retrieve the white Cadillac from the water. "They really had to think outside the box on this one," said Boatwright. "The car was totally submerged so they knew they had to act quickly, and they did just that. We are all hoping and praying for a positive outcome for the patient." Boatwright said the stretch of road that the driver wrecked on has been a known trouble spot for traffic. He said another car crashed in a similar way a little over a year ago, but the driver in that case was able to extricate himself. A spokesman for the Chattanooga Police Department said the traffic division will likely be looking at potential preventative measures along the road, including guard rails, in the wake of Tuesday's accident.

Carol A. Smith claims she was injured by an employee who was texting. (File photo) (The Associated Press) Print Email Aimee Green | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Aimee Green | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on February 07, 2017 at 5:50 PM comments A Wal-Mart shopper who says she was knocked down when an employee texting on his cellphone pushed a cart full of boxes into her filed a $175,000 against the world's largest retailer. Carol A. Smith claims the employee was texting while rounding a corner and maneuvering a stock cart stacked high with boxes when he crashed into her and her shopping cart. The incident happened at Wal-Mart's Bend store on Aug. 13, 2015, according to Smith's lawsuit filed last week in Deschutes County Circuit Court. The suit says Smith suffered a concussion; tenderness to her ears; and stiffness, tightness and loss of range of motion to her neck, shoulders and back. Nearly 11/2 years later, she still suffers from post-concussive syndrome, which includes short-term memory loss, said her attorney. Wal-Mart's national director of media relations, Ragan Dickens, on Tuesday said, "We have just been served with this complaint. We take Ms. Smith's claims seriously and will respond appropriately with the court. Due to this matter being active litigation, we can't comment further." Dickens also declined to answer a question about whether the store has any policies prohibiting employees from texting while on the job. Smith's Bend attorney, Warren John West, said he's represented many car crash victims who were struck by drivers who were texting or talking on their cellphones. But the circumstances surrounding Smith's injury is much more rare, he said. Smith, who lives in the Bend area, seeks up to $25,000 for medical costs, and $150,000 for pain and suffering.  Read the lawsuit here. -- Aimee Green agreen@oregonian.com o_aimee Most Read Active Discussions AM News Snapshot The day's important news, including local and national headlines, delivered every morning.

(Source: Southaven Police Department) MEMPHIS, TN (WMC) - A simple trip to Walmart turned into a nightmare for one Southaven woman. Instead of quickly getting in and out of the store, she ran into car problems, but now police are wandering if her car problems were part of a crime. Southaven Police Department is working to identify a man seen on surveillance video. The man walks up to the woman and tells her that her car appears to have oil leaking from it. He offers to help her out. "She declines so she goes ahead and drives to the Ford dealership," Lt. Mark Little said. Mechanics at the Ford dealership said someone cut her car's transmission line Police said they don't know if the man in the video had anything to do with the woman's car trouble. In fact, they said he may have just been a Good Samaritan trying to help. Still, they want to talk to him to find out what he knows. Copyright 2017 WMC Action News 5.

So what does that mean for Riverhead’s bustling shopping district? “I think residents like Route 58 because it’s a compact shopping district where they can get their wares and goods and then get right back out to rural areas or farm fields,” town Supervisor Sean Walter said. But in this era of remote and online shopping, the supervisor said the town “has to be wary,” adding that he hopes the Town Board can begin a master plan update of Route 58 zoning this year. “I’m cautiously optimistic that we will have some additional funding this year to maybe start that study, because I want to be ahead of the curve if it’s true that box stores could be coming to an end,” Mr. Walter said. An examination of building applications pending or underway along Route 58 showed 13 projects in various stages of development. Here’s where they all stand. EAST OF THE TRAFFIC CIRCLE • In 2016, the Town Board changed zoning once again to permit movie theaters on Route 58, having previously limited them to downtown Riverhead in hopes of drawing a multiplex there. The owner of the former Walmart shopping center, Manhattan-based Philips International, has submitted an application to raze the Walmart building, replace it with a multiplex and create two new restaurants at the north end of the property. “We are negotiating a lease with Regal Entertainment Group at this point,” said Andrew Aberham, international director of sales and leasing for Philips International. “We’re pretty far along. We’re not at the finish line, but we’re definitely closer to the finish line. Time is critical here, so we’re moving on all fronts.” Regal, the country’s largest movie theater chain, is the same company Mr. Walter tried to lure to the former Woolworth site in downtown Riverhead several years ago, an offer Regal ultimately turned down. A theater was also proposed in 1996 for Riverhead Centre, the complex anchored by Home Depot, but Regal eventually dropped out of that project, which had been stalled by a lawsuit. A Regal spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on its possible interest in the Route 58 site. “We’re excited about it,” Mr. Aberham said of a possible deal with Regal. “The Riverhead market is definitely in need of a movie theater.” • Developer Richard Israel’s Riverhead Commons development at the former Rolle Brothers site, across from Firestone, has been in the proposal stages since 2011. Mr. Israel’s company bought the property in 2009. Riverhead Commons calls for one restaurant and three retail spaces comprising approximately 50,000 square feet. It was last before the Riverhead Planning Board in October, when issues under discussion included the location of an RPZ (reduced pressure zone) valve to protect water from contamination and whether to require a cross access easement with a medical office proposed for Ostrander Avenue, enabling cars to exit away from Route 58. • The southeast corner of Route 58 and Ostrander Avenue, site of a former gas station, could also be redeveloped. In October, owner TSA Capital received Planning Board approval to add 14,378 square feet of property acquired from an adjacent church, which would make it possible to build a new gas station in the same spot. Chris Kent, the attorney for TSA, said at the time that no convenience store was planned, just a gas station. • After twice being hit by cars barreling off the Route 58 traffic circle, Pizza Hut asked to be let out of its lease late last year. Michael Hartofelis, an attorney for property owner Bell Boulevard Realty LLC, told the Riverhead Zoning Board of Appeals in December that Pizza Hut would surrender its lease for the site and that an urgent care walk-in clinic called STAT Health was interested in taking over the location. STAT Health recently appeared before the town Architectural Review Board. • Tire Country, which took over the 1,933-square-foot former Meineke Muffler building, seeks to build a 3,067-square-foot L-shaped addition that would stretch behind Friendly’s. That application was granted several zoning variances by the ZBA in December. • A Popeye’s chicken has been proposed for a vacant one-acre lot on the north side of Route 58, east of Malvese. That application has been before the Planning Board once and no action has been taken on it yet. WEST OF THE TRAFFIC CIRCLE • A 2,590-square-foot Sonic drive-in fast food restaurant was proposed for land across from Apple Honda on Route 58 in January 2016. It called for 40 indoor seats, 16 outdoor seats and 22 drive-in parking stalls. Town planning and building administrator Jeff Murphree said the town asked Sonic to supply more information following a public hearing but hasn’t heard from them since. • A similar situation exists regarding Zwanger Persiri’s proposal for a radiology center at the southwest corner of Route 58 and Osborn Avenue, according to Mr. Murphree, who said he has not heard back from the applicant. That property is currently being used to store cars from the adjacent Apple Honda, which is constructing a previously approved two-story 7,433-square-foot showroom and office building just east of its existing building. • Just west of the proposed Sonic site, Apple Honda has proposed a 60,048-square-foot retail center on 12 acres east of Riverhead Centre on Route 58. That project received preliminary site plan approval from the Planning Board in September. • The Shops at Riverhead, proposed by Brixmor Property Group has been the source of criticism dating back to 2012, when the developers clear-cut the entire 41-acre site, with town approval, to allow for construction of Costco, to date the only tenant at the site. Neighbors and town officials said the clear-cutting led to noise and dust and that the trees Brixmor planted to shield neighbors often died. Now, Brixmor is back with plans for 120,450-square-foot of additional retail on a different section of the property. In January, the Planning Board granted preliminary site plan approval, with the stipulation that Brixmor build a 10-foot sound wall to protect private homes to the east. Ulta Beauty, PetSmart and Marshalls/Home Goods are among the proposed tenants, according to the applicant. • Peconic Bay Medical Center is currently building a 3,500-square-foot annex at the northwest corner of Route 58 and Kroemer Avenue. The project, approved in 2015, is aimed at reducing emergency room traffic at PBMC’s main Roanoke Avenue campus, according to hospital president and CEO Andrew Mitchell. • Directly across the street, Barclay Ehrler received site plan approval in 2016 for a 14,400-square-foot retail building on a vacant 1.5-acre lot, a property Mr. Ehrler told the Planning Board he purchased 20 years ago and has been trying to develop for more than a decade. • Just west of Walmart is the second of two hotels developer Lee Browning planned for Route 58. The 114-room Hilton Garden Inn was built in 2007 and a 140-room Marriott Residence Inn hotel is now being erected directly beside it.

That property is currently being used to store cars from the adjacent Apple Honda, which is constructing a previously approved two-story 7,433-square-foot showroom and office building just east of its existing building. • Just west of the proposed Sonic site, Apple Honda has proposed a 60,048-square-foot retail center on 12 acres east of Riverhead Centre on Route 58. That project received preliminary site plan approval from the Planning Board in September. • The Shops at Riverhead, proposed by Brixmor Property Group has been the source of criticism dating back to 2012, when the developers clear-cut the entire 41-acre site, with town approval, to allow for construction of Costco, to date the only tenant at the site. Neighbors and town officials said the clear-cutting led to noise and dust and that the trees Brixmor planted to shield neighbors often died. Now, Brixmor is back with plans for 120,450-square-foot of additional retail on a different section of the property. In January, the Planning Board granted preliminary site plan approval, with the stipulation that Brixmor build a 10-foot sound wall to protect private homes to the east. Ulta Beauty, PetSmart and Marshalls/Home Goods are among the proposed tenants, according to the applicant. • Peconic Bay Medical Center is currently building a 3,500-square-foot annex at the northwest corner of Route 58 and Kroemer Avenue. The project, approved in 2015, is aimed at reducing emergency room traffic at PBMC’s main Roanoke Avenue campus, according to hospital president and CEO Andrew Mitchell. • Directly across the street, Barclay Ehrler received site plan approval in 2016 for a 14,400-square-foot retail building on a vacant 1.5-acre lot, a property Mr. Ehrler told the Planning Board he purchased 20 years ago and has been trying to develop for more than a decade. • Just west of Walmart is the second of two hotels developer Lee Browning planned for Route 58. The 114-room Hilton Garden Inn was built in 2007 and a 140-room Marriott Residence Inn hotel is now being erected directly beside it.

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Feb 9, 2017 at 1:00PM February will be a busy month for investors. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) will report this week, looking to extend its streak of impressive earnings beats. Networking hardware giant Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) reports next week, aiming to convince investors that its transition to a softwarecentric company will eventually return it to growth. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) will report in two weeks, in the midst of a major shift in its e-commerce strategy . Sky-high expectations Graphics chip company NVIDIA destroyed analyst estimates throughout 2016, with its latest quarterly report in November beating expectations by a wide margin. Its gaming business is booming, driven by strong demand for its Pascal graphics cards and the soon-to-launch Nintendo Switch game console. The data center and automotive businesses, both much smaller than gaming, are growing at an even faster rate. Image source: NVIDIA. When its fourth-quarter results are revealed after the market close on Thursday, Feb. 9., all eyes will be on whether NVIDIA can keep up its incredible growth rate. Its stock more than tripled in 2016 as revenue and profit expanded rapidly, but with AMD set to launch competing high-end graphics cards in the next few months, NVIDIA's significant market share may take a hit. NVIDIA's early focus on pushing its graphics chips as machine learning accelerators has paid off in a big way. The data center segment, which includes NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs aimed the data center and high-performance computing , nearly tripled year over year during the third quarter. That kind of growth rate can't go on forever, but it's clear that NVIDIA has struck gold. With the stock now trading for around 60 times trailing-12-month earnings, the company will need to continue to impress investors in order to keep the stock price afloat. Any disappointing numbers could send this highflier tumbling. A tough quarter Cisco Systems, the dominant provider of networking hardware, doesn't expect a remarkable fiscal second quarter. The company sees its revenue declining by 2% to 4% year over year even after excluding divestitures, a slowdown that reflects both uncertainty among its major customers and its ongoing shift to a recurring revenue business model. Image source: Cisco Systems. Cisco's core switching and routing businesses were inconsistent throughout 2016, with growth in some quarters and declines in others. This was counteracted by solid growth in its smaller businesses, including collaboration, data center, and security. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, though, both the data center and collaboration segments suffered 3% year-over-year revenue declines. Security posted a double-digit increase, but the results raise questions about Cisco's growth strategy. Its fiscal second-quarter results are expected after the market close on Feb. 15. Analysts aren't expecting much, with the average estimate calling for a 3.2% decrease in revenue and a slight dip in adjusted earnings per share. Cisco recently announced a major acquisition, agreeing to pay $3.7 billion for software company AppDynamics, a move that should help accelerate its shift toward software. But Cisco remains dependent on hardware, and weakness in its core businesses will continue to hurt its results. Two-day shipping for everyone After testing a subscription shipping program similar to Amazon Prime, Wal-Mart has scrapped that effort, instead shifting to free two-day shipping on millions of items for orders over $35. This is far more generous than Amazon's non-Prime free shipping offer, which has a minimum order of $50 and shipping times that vary. Image source: Wal-Mart.http://corporate.walmart.com/galleries/e-commerce Wal-Mart has been accelerating its push into e-commerce, paying $3 billion for start-up Jet.com last year and putting Jet's CEO in charge of its entire e-commerce business. The company's online grocery service, which allows customers to place orders online and pick up for free at hundreds of Wal-Mart locations, is another facet of the e-commerce strategy, one that can't be duplicated by online-only retailers. Wal-Mart will report its fourth-quarter results before the market opens on Feb. 21. The retailer's e-commerce business has been accelerating in recent quarters, a sign that the company's initiatives are having a positive effect. Wal-Mart's stores are still the core of the business, and they enable initiatives like online grocery pickup. But Wal-Mart will need to greatly expand its e-commerce business to avoid being left in the dust. Timothy Green owns shares of Cisco Systems.

Hot Topics: Fire & Ice Festival Taft Widening Windy and Hot Day Tiny House for Rent Love of Hiking TVHS Basketball RH Line Horse Rescued Police Calls Library Director to Retire Brady Murr-Andrews pleas guilty to crimes in several cases The 23-year-old will face at least 15 years in prison on multiple felony charges in three separate cases By Sam Lounsberry Reporter-Herald Staff Writer Posted:   02/08/2017 08:47:19 PM MST Murr-Andrews A man Loveland police chased from the north Wal-Mart last January after a reported shooting there took a plea deal Wednesday. Appearing in custody, Brady Murr-Andrews, 23, pleaded guilty to first-degree assault, a Class 5 felony, and first degree kidnapping, a Class 1 felony, the latter of which carries a mandatory prison sentence of 10-15 years. He avoids a charge of attempted murder with the plea. As part of the plea deal, Murr-Andrews also pleaded guilty Wednesday to two charges from separate cases; he admitted to committing forgery, a Class 6 felony, for cashing fraudulent checks in 2015 as well as contributing to the delinquency of minors, a Class 4 felony, for providing alcohol to three underage girls in 2015. An additional case against Murr-Andrews alleging counts of identity theft, forgery and theft will also likely be dismissed as part of the plea deal offered by the Larimer County District Attorney's Office, Eighth Judicial District Judge Susan Blanco said. The arrest affidavit in that case, though, shows that Murr-Andrews told police he was forced to cash forged checks by threats from 48-year-old John Krallis, the man Murr-Andrews admitting to assaulting and kidnapping last year. Murr-Andrews also reportedly received methamphetamine for cashing the checks, court documents show. Originally, Murr-Andrews faced an attempted murder charge for his involvement in the January 2016 police chase that led law enforcement to discover Krallis severely beaten and with bullets lodged in a vehicle suspected to have been abandoned by Murr-Andrews and 23-year-old Eric Mecseji. Advertisement Mecseji pleaded guilty to the same charges as Murr-Andrews in the case in December, and awaits a sentencing hearing March 2. Murr-Andrews will be sentenced April 13 to at least 15 years in prison, said Deputy District Attorney Bob Percifield, the prosecutor on the case. A pre-sentencing investigation will take place before that hearing for Percifield and Murr-Andrews' attorney Eric Vanatta to summon any witnesses to the case whose reports may affect the defendant's sentence. Murr-Andrews is currently being held in Larimer County Jail on $220,000 of five separate bonds that can be met by putting up property he owns or paying $22,000 in cash out of his own pocket through the services of a bondsman. Additionally, he is being held on a $300 cash-only bond. Sam Lounsberry: 970-376-7598, lounsberrys@reporter-herald.com and twitter.com/samlounz.

WTVD By Stephanie Lopez Thursday, February 09, 2017 01:58PM APEX, North Carolina -- A group of firefighters in North Carolina are sending out a big thank you after a good Samaritan took care of their grocery bill for them. The firefighters at Apex Station 2 didn't see who did it, but they want them to know how much it meant to them. A Walmart receipt with a handwritten note saying "Thank you for all you do," is one of the only clues the firefighters have about who paid for their groceries Sunday, when they got an emergency call and had to leave everything behind. "The nice employees at Walmart told us that it was a lady behind us in line," Station 2 Engineer Jeffery Jones said. "But we never did actually get to meet her and tell her, thank you." The groceries were already purchased and waiting for them when they returned after the call, and they said that means a lot to them -- especially when they spend every moment of the day getting ready for the next emergency. "Making sure our gear is ready, making sure the truck is completely in service," Jones said. When asked how big of a difference can a few minutes make when it comes to their response time, firefighter Andrew Baker said. "It can sometimes mean life and death." By the time they get the call, to the time they're on the road, the station strives to spend no more than 90 seconds to get going. "It's important to us," Baker said. "We take a lot of pride in trying to get out." Now they want the mystery shopper to know she's always welcomed at Station 2. "We would like to tell her thank you from the bottom of our hearts," Jones said. "It makes me feel like there are still good people in the world," Baker said. "You don't get that every day, so to me it gives you a warm feeling inside to know that people really do care about you."

Durkin | 1:36 pm, February 9th, 2017   Please enable Javascript to watch. Every time that a major snow storm like this wallops the East Coast, local news reporters are given the unenviable task of heading out into the inclement weather to provide commentary on the storm. Today’s storm pelting Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia is no different; and during a live segment this morning on Fox 29 in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, one SEPTA bus driver got caught up giving sneaky passengers the business. Steve Keeley, a reporter for Fox 29 in Philadelphia, was tasked with interviewing Walmart employees in the suburb of Warrington just as a SEPTA bus back to the city pulled up. But as Keeley and his cameraman hopped on board to grab an impromptu interview with the unidentified driver, a few of the Walmart employees appear to try and sneak on behind the live shot. That’s when the driver loses his cool in the middle of his sentence, firing off, “HEY! YA’LL BETTER PAY! I DON’T CARE IF IT’S SNOWING OUT THERE! YA’LL BETTER PAY!” Keeley managed brief exchanges with the young men, as the Fox 29 reporter joked that station news anchor Mike Jerrick will take care of the fees associated with the fare. “The SEPTA bus can pull into a Starbucks with Mike Jerrick’s credit card,” he added. If the name Mike Jerrick sounds familiar, by the way, he has worked himself into a few recent Mediaite headlines; the longtime Philadelphia anchor recently called out Kellyanne Conway‘s “alternative facts” flap by blurting out, “She’s good at bullshit!” live on the air, resulting in a temporary suspension. Of course, it didn’t take Jerrick long after his suspension to land a few eye rolls within minutes being back on air. Jerrick’s colleague Alex Holley, back in the studio, commented, “That’s a party bus,” before tweeting out a video of the SEPTA bus driver’s outburst. “Only in Philly,” Holley commented.

WTVD By Stephanie Lopez Thursday, February 09, 2017 12:36PM APEX, NC -- Apex firefighters are sending out a big thank you after a good Samaritan took care of their grocery bill for them. The firefighters at Apex Station 2 didn't see who did it, but they want them to know how much it meant to them. A Walmart receipt with a handwritten note saying "Thank you for all you do," is one of the only clues the firefighters have about who paid for their groceries Sunday, when they got an emergency call and had to leave everything behind. "The nice employees at Walmart told us that it was a lady behind us in line," Station 2 Engineer Jeffery Jones said. "But we never did actually get to meet her and tell her, thank you." The groceries were already purchased and waiting for them when they returned after the call, and they said that means a lot to them -- especially when they spend every moment of the day getting ready for the next emergency. "Making sure our gear is ready, making sure the truck is completely in service," Jones said. When asked how big of a difference can a few minutes make when it comes to their response time, firefighter Andrew Baker said. "It can sometimes mean life and death." By the time they get the call, to the time they're on the road, the station strives to spend no more than 90 seconds to get going. "It's important to us," Baker said. "We take a lot of pride in trying to get out." Now they want the mystery shopper to know she's always welcomed at Station 2. "We would like to tell her thank you from the bottom of our hearts," Jones said. "It makes me feel like there are still good people in the world," Baker said. "You don't get that every day, so to me it gives you a warm feeling inside to know that people really do care about you."

It has been corrected. Bloomberg Amazon might be able to convince shoppers to adapt to a more automated grocery-shopping experience — if it’s sufficiently convenient. There’s one thing that every grocery store has to have in stock if it’s going to make customers happy: convenience. If, as has been suggested, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.74% is going to make a major move into the bricks-and-mortar supermarket space, convenience and time savings are where it has to differentiate itself. But there are questions about whether its apparently favored format, which includes many robots and few human workers, will satisfy grocery shoppers. “It seems really hard to imagine a day where the retail experience becomes a bunch of robots,” said James Lamberti, chief marketing officer of Quri, a retail intelligence and analytics company. “Robotics and tech will be behind the scenes, with more people servicing out front.” Lamberti thinks there are different reasons, or “occasions,” when people go to a grocery retailer, he said, whether it’s the quick in-and-out of grabbing lunch, or the meandering trip where shoppers wander the aisles. Changing those shopping behaviors will be difficult, but Morgan Stanley, in a note published Tuesday, noted that Amazon has done it before. Read also: Supermarkets’ best weapon against e-tailers: produce See also: Amazon takes on tech’s white whale: grocery shopping “In our view, behavior modification is Amazon’s core business model — bringing consumers to the site, converting them to Prime and (through leading selection, clean interface, powerful suggestion engine, and low-friction shopping/checkout) driving them to spend more across categories,” wrote the Morgan Stanley analysts. Those analysts estimate that the grocery business is a $770 billion segment of annual U.S. consumer expenditures. The next frontier for advancement in the grocery-store space is saving time in the shopping process, experts say. “A lot of the focus on saving time is in the kitchen,” said Darren Seifer, NPD Group’s food and beverage analyst, referring to factors like cook time. “Now there’s a shift going on because more consumers are using fresh food, which requires a little more prep. The notion of saving the consumer time while getting their groceries is how they have to think. There’s no one specific way to do it.” Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -1.53% has talked up its curbside grocery pickup service as an option for busy families looking for a way to save time on what otherwise might be an hours-long supermarket trip. According to the New York Post, Amazon is looking into a 10,000-plus-square-foot automated grocery store. Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos has taken to Twitter to rebut that report. .@nypost, whoever your anonymous sources are on this story https://t.co/VFyzGQcOAZ – they’ve mixed up their meds!— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) February 7, 2017 And on the NYPost article, if anybody knows how to get 20% margins in groceries, call me! :)— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) February 7, 2017 Even if Amazon isn’t planning stores like this right now, the existence of the Amazon Fresh offering and the Amazon Go convenience store show that the company has an interest in getting deeper into groceries. “While Amazon’s business has momentum — making up [about 5%] of its total addressable U.S. consumer expenditure market, driving [approximately] 50% of U.S. expenditure growth — grocery remains one of the greener fields, with only [about] 2% estimated online industry penetration,” Morgan Stanley wrote. “At some point over the next few years, Amazon may need grocery to maintain its same-store sales and strong overall gross merchandise value growth.” In the longer term, a study from the Food Marketing Institute and Nielsen found that online grocery spending could capture 20% of all grocery shopping by 2025, totaling about $100 billion in sales annually. Here's what's behind the whiskey boom in the U.S.(3:46) Whiskey suppliers' gross revenues reached $8.1 billion in 2015 and are estimated to have grown further in 2016. The surging demand for whiskey in the U.S. has led to a boom in craft distilleries opening up across the country. “Traditional bricks-and-mortar stores have to think now about how they can get creative with tech-savvy consumers,” said Seifer. As Rupesh Pareskh, senior analyst for food, grocery and consumer products at Oppenheimer & Co., said he sees it, the equation for being a threat to Wal-Mart, Kroger Co. KR, -0.03% and any of the other players in the industry is good experience plus lower prices. “Grocery has razor-thin margins,” he said. “If they can do something to take the cost out of the grocery store, that could be viewed as a negative for other stores.” See also: Amazon is not the only online retailer developing a store for the future Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that the per-store build cost for an Amazon bricks-and-mortar location is in the range of $6 million to $10 million. For now, online grocery would be the next step in digitizing grocery shopping, and consumers have not been quick to adopt it. The latest survey data from Morgan Stanley shows that the top reason people don’t shop online is they like to select fresh produce for themselves. Where Quri’s Lamberti sees e-commerce already cutting into the grocery business are for items that are commoditized and have long shelf lives, like cleaning products and paper goods. “It’s hard not to see Amazon cutting into that in a major way, but there are lots of occasions that aren’t about robots,” he said. Even if change is slow, it’s happening, and grocers have to be ready. The NPD Group says 52 million U.S. consumers are currently grocery shopping online, with 20 million planning to increase their online grocery-shopping activity in the next six months. Younger generations, like millennials, are among those favoring the online option. Amazon shares closed Wednesday up nearly 1% and are up 68% for the past year. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.36% is up 23.8% for the last 12 months.

"The valuations are pretty darned reasonable, but I have a hard time proving it to people because we are in an incredibly visceral, polarizing moment stemming from the election of a pro-business president who seems to rack up an incredible amount of baggage on a daily basis," the "Mad Money" host said. To prove that stocks are not overvalued once and for all, Cramer compared the top companies that dominated the market back in 1999, when the market was last on the verge of collapsing due to true overvaluation. Overvaluation is a different scenario than an economic collapse, such as the Great Recession. That is why Cramer chose to look at the 1999 bear market, because it was the last time stocks collapsed under their own weight due to overrun fundamentals. Getty Images People walking outside the New York Stock Exchange on January 3, 2017. The five biggest stocks at the end of 1999 were Microsoft valued at $600 billion, General Electric at $507 billion, Cisco Systems at $355 billion, Wal-Mart at $307 billion and Intel at $275 billion. The current five largest companies are Apple at $689 billion, Alphabet at $565 billion, Microsoft at $490 billion, Berkshire Hathaway at $400 billion and Amazon at $388 billion. Cramer also looked at Facebook's $387 billion, since it's only one billion less than Amazon. Back in 1999, Microsoft and Intel sold at 65 times earnings, and 35 times earnings. The assumption was that the internet would take over the world and these companies had the software and hardware to make it happen. Unfortunately, the earnings explosion that investors expected never happened. Cisco's earnings pretty much collapsed soon after its business was crushed by telco carriers that raised money in the stock market to build out their networks. Wal-Mart was supposed to be the fastest growing retailer, too. Unfortunately, the company over-expanded and the model didn't scale overseas like it was supposed to and Wal-Mart hit a wall. "You could argue that all of these companies were overvalued on past earnings and they turned out to be even more overvalued on future earnings," Cramer said. Looking at today's top companies, Apple sells at just 14 times earnings with a rapidly growing service revenue stream. Alphabet sells at about 21 times next year's earnings with $52 billion in cash overseas and has a 16 percent growth rate. Facebook sells at 22 times next year's earnings with 52 percent revenue growth and has $29 billion in cash. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sells for 20 times earnings. The only outlier was Amazon, trading at 110 times earnings. But Amazon has always been an outlier, Cramer said. Given how it has crushed Wal-Mart and threatened the entire brick-and-mortar business with extinction, Cramer thinks it is merely taking the market capitalization away from the businesses it destroys and said the market cap is justified. "The question to ask isn't how did this current group of behemoths get so expensive. It's how did they get so cheap," Cramer said. With only one of the six largest companies not bound by conventional metrics, Trump or no Trump, the valuations seemed completely rational to Cramer. Questions for Cramer?

One victim was removed from the car. Photo by Emmett Gienapp /Times Free Press. Breaking news update A 75-year-old man died the day after he drove his vehicle off the roadway and into a pond near the Brainerd Wal-Mart late Tuesday afternoon. PREVIOUS STORY FOLLOWS Battalion Chief Rick Boatwright with the Chattanooga Fire Department said the man was leaving the Wal-Mart and traveling north on Greenway View Drive when he drove off the roadway and down an embankment to the water below. When responders arrived, the car was completely submerged and upside down. Firefighters clambered down the embankment, climbed on top of the car and attached a winch, which was used to pull the vehicle onto its side to so they could see the driver. Once the vehicle had been raised partially, firefighters broke one of the windows and pulled the unconscious man out of the car. Firefighters immediately began administering cardio pulmonary resuscitation, according to a fire department news release. It has not been reported how long the man was underwater before responders arrived. Paramedics with Hamilton County Emergency Services took the man to Erlanger hospital. Two of the firefighters rode with the victim in the ambulance and continued CPR. The man's identity has not been revealed. Crews were able to retrieve the white Cadillac from the water. "They really had to think outside the box on this one," said Boatwright. "The car was totally submerged so they knew they had to act quickly, and they did just that. We are all hoping and praying for a positive outcome for the patient." Boatwright said the stretch of road that the driver wrecked on has been a known trouble spot for traffic. He said another car crashed in a similar way a little over a year ago, but the driver in that case was able to extricate himself. A spokesman for the Chattanooga Police Department said the traffic division will likely be looking at potential preventative measures along the road, including guard rails, in the wake of Tuesday's accident.

(EDDIE KEOGH/REUTERS) Shoppers leave the Asda superstore in High Wycombe, Britain on Feb. 7. (EDDIE KEOGH/REUTERS) Wal-Mart aims to leverage struggling British arm Asda Add to ... JAMES DAVEY London — Reuters Published Wednesday, Feb. 08, 2017 5:03PM EST Last updated Wednesday, Feb. 08, 2017 5:03PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is throwing its weight as the world’s largest retailer behind its struggling British arm Asda after admitting it was too slow to respond effectively to the threat posed by the discount supermarkets. Asda Group PLC thrived for a decade as Britain’s cheapest supermarket after it was bought by Wal-Mart in 1999 and remains the third-biggest in the country. But German-owned Aldi and Lidl have steadily cut into Asda’s market share. The two discounters started opening stores in Britain in 1990 and 1994, respectively, but their big breakthrough came when the economic crisis hit in 2008 and more British shoppers were prepared to give them a go. Declining sales show signs of tapering off since Wal-Mart veteran Sean Clarke became Asda’s president and chief executive last July, with a focus on improving the look and feel of the stores as well as enhancing product lines. Wal-Mart will provide further firepower by ensuring Asda leverages the parent’s purchasing strength in everything from refrigerators to own-brand products and real estate to drive down prices and costs, said Scott Price, chief administrative officer of Walmart International. “One thing that maybe we would criticize ourselves for is that we didn’t start the repositioning of the business sooner, that we didn’t focus more on the leverage opportunities so that Asda was able to invest more aggressively in price,” Mr. Price told Reuters in an interview. “What Sean is able to do with his global experience at Wal-Mart is to know what levers to pull,” he said, in a reference to Mr. Clarke’s time with Wal-Mart in Japan, Canada and most recently as chief executive in China. Working more closely with its parent, Asda will be able to market more Wal-Mart brands as its own at a lower price than rivals, Mr. Price said. “He’s able to pull private [Wal-Mart] brands and put an Asda brand on it that is equal to the national brand in the U.K. in terms of quality and sensory, but at a price that no one else can match,” he said of Mr. Clarke. In return, Wal-Mart was looking for more ways to exploit the areas where Asda has excelled, for example with a popular olive oil originally sourced by Asda and now sold across the group, including in the United States and 10 other international markets. From its headquarters in Leeds in northern England, Asda claimed to be the first of Britain’s major grocers – which also includes market leader Tesco, No. 2 Sainsbury’s and No. 4 Morrisons – to spot the threat from the discounters. With fewer stores in the more affluent southeast of England than its rivals and the vast majority of its business in the large stores that have become less fashionable in recent years, Asda was most exposed. After it lost its price advantage and failed to offer other reasons to shop there, performance slumped. Wal-Mart added to Asda’s problems by diverting key executives from Britain to the United States and focusing too much on cutting costs and maximizing short-term profit at the expense of investing to protect market share, analysts said. The result has been nine straight quarters of underlying sales decline since the middle of 2014, which translated into a more than 1 percentage point loss in market share, according to researcher Kantar Worldpanel. Its share currently stands at 15.6 per cent, versus more than 28 per cent for Tesco. David Cheesewright, CEO of Walmart International, in June, 2016, expressed disappointment at Asda’s weak performance and said it would shift from protecting profit to protecting market share. The data shows signs of improving. In November, Asda reported a like-for-like sales decline of 5.8 per cent for the third quarter to Sept. 30, compared to the second quarter when it reported a fall of 7.5 per cent, its worst drop in quarterly sales. A further material improvement is expected when it reports fourth quarter sales on Feb. 21, with analysts forecasting a decline of 2 per cent to 3 per cent. Monthly industry data has also shown a better performance over Christmas and January. While sales fell 1.9 per cent year-on-year by value in the 12 weeks to Jan. 29, according to Kantar, Asda increased the number of shoppers visiting its stores. The improvements reflect the early work of Clarke and former Sainsbury’s executive Roger Burnley, who joined as chief operating officer in October, analysts said. That includes making Asda stores cleaner and less cluttered, with more staff on the shop floor and better availability of fresh produce and meat – key ranges that either drive customers into stores or, if you get them wrong, out. Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital, said there are also signs that Asda is stepping up product innovation with, for example, new items in the frozen and chilled areas and in its “Extra Special” premium brand. At the same time Asda has developed complementary services and partners within its stores, such as with sports retailer Decathlon and butcher McGee’s, while more freedom is being given to individual managers when it comes to the layout of their stores. It looks likely to be a long road to recovery, however. “Things are going a bit better but they’re going a bit better from a catastrophic level of performance,” one senior British retail industry executive told Reuters, asking not to be named. “Everybody thinks you can turn around a business in a year or two and you can’t. This is a five-year project,” he said. He questioned whether Wal-Mart would provide the necessary investment. “Their instinct is to save their way to victory.” Mr. Price said Wal-Mart was committed to Asda and has tasked Mr. Clarke with building a sustainable business model.

The academy, situated on a second floor above the retail store, will employ 17 people. They will train managers and supervisors for 21 Walmart stores in Adams, Cumberland, Dauphin, Franklin, Lancaster, Lebanon and York counties, according to a company representative. The academy will operate two-week training sessions designed to give students a mix of classroom instruction and sales-floor experience, the representative said. The average class will have about 15 people, but can accommodate up to 30. The idea is to take trainees out of their home stores so they can focus on training, without requiring them to travel overnight, the representative said. The Springettsbury academy is expected to begin classes this week, according to the representative. Up to 4,500 employees will be trained there each year. The curriculum will cover leadership, merchandising, operations, technology and customer service, in addition to department-specific training. Based in Bentonville, Ark., Walmart Stores Inc. has said it is spending about $2.7 billion over two years in higher wages, training and education. The company employs about 50,000 people in Pennsylvania.

In 2016, Amazon became the world’s largest apparel retailer and Zappos, owned by Amazon, is one of the fastest-growing shoe retailers in the world with its online-only business platform. Annibal Sodero, assistant professor at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, said every category is being impacted in some way, including growing online sales, often at the expense of in-store sales. He said the days of people being afraid to purchase items online are in the past. Pointing to himself, Sodero said everything he was wearing during a recent interview was purchased online, including his watch. “So many companies are coming up with technology that reaches out to consumers to allow them to seemingly try on clothes and shoes online with augmented realities and sizing apps which makes consumers more apt to shop for clothes online,” Sodero said. DISRUPTING TRADITIONAL RETAIL Last year, Amazon posted U.S. apparel sales of $16.3 billion, second to only Wal-Mart. Amazon increased the number of apparel and accessory products on its website by 87% last year from the year before, and that’s more than the combined online sales of  five large online clothing competitors — Macy’s, Nordstrom, Kohl’s, Gap, and Victoria’s Secret parent company L Brands Inc. Consumers can look at the early holiday sales results and see that more online shopping was done in late 2016 than any other year.  Everyone from Macy’s to Home Depot have said online sales were stronger than expected, while in-store sales and traffic underperformed. Sodero said it’s not just apparel, shoes and accessories quickly gravitating to online sales. Consumers are perfectly happy, he explained, to also buy washing machines and power drills online. He said Chinese e-tailer NewEgg is also making a splash in electronic sales, another example of how a startup is disrupting traditional retail. “We shouldn’t be surprised to see this shift take place,” Sodero said. “Retail has always been akin to changes. Look first at how corner bookstores were put out of business by the book giants of Barnes & Noble and Borders. Now, Amazon has decimated those giants, and that has happened in our lifetime. “There will be more of that disruption in the near future as more once-prominent retail brands fade into history.” $880 BILLION MIGRATION A recent report from the World Economic Forum said retailers can expect to see $880 billion of commerce move from brick-and-mortar to online during the next decade. Keith Anderson, vice president of strategy and insights at Profitero, said in the past there may have been some categories that were seen as insulated from the threat of online disruption, but that just isn’t the case today. Looking back to early years of e-commerce, Anderson said the price-to-weight ratio greatly dictated what was sellable online. For instance, he said a diamond ring is expensive and lightweight. He said items were also shipped in ones and twos, entirely different from the traditional full-truck load logistics that dominated traditional retail for 30 years. He said diamonds and shoes also have a sensory component to them and once companies like Blue Diamond and Zappos figured out how to deliver on the sensory and convenience propositions, those categories quickly moved online. He said there are about 10 considerations to help retailers know if a product is conducive to online sales, some as simple as temperature sensitivity, such as dairy or meat. Anderson said virtually everything is sellable online today, particularly now that retailers like Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Home Depot are offering in-store pickup and shipping from the store. Before these delivery channels were available a few years ago, some things weren’t sold online. Anderson said U.S. consumers have also become more willing to let someone else pick their cantaloupes for their grocery order, when just a few years ago that wasn’t the case. He said improved bandwidth and higher resolution photos and the iPhone have also greatly helped to push more sales online. The iPhone will be 10 years old in June, and the iPad will turn 7 in April. Suppliers can no longer depend on the linear growth patterns of the past four decades related to new store openings by retailers like Wal-Mart, Anderson said. Retailers are opening fewer stores, and more brick-and-mortar sites continue to close each year. Anderson said e-commerce is about high frequency. He said if retailers like Walmart can make the high frequency online orders easy like groceries, then it’s reasonable to assume they can also sell more general merchandise online to the same customer. “Think about how Wal-Mart moved from its discount stores to the Supercenter because it knew groceries were a trip driver,” Anderson said. “Now Walmart is looking at that same plan online with its grocery program which utilizes stores as the pickup center.” READY FOR THE MOVE Anderson credits Home Depot with making great strides in e-commerce because it had to do so. When Amazon became the search engine for a majority of consumers last year, Home Depot saw an opportunity to jump in. Anderson said people might start their search for washing machines online at Amazon, read reviews and scope out products, but they might then check Home Depot for the same model. And that retailer was ready with an online presence and a pickup-in-store or delivery option. When asked how suppliers might get themselves ready for more categories to move online, Anderson said the worst thing they can do is ignore the situation. He said the time for CPG companies to have an online strategy was yesterday and there is no time to waste going forward. Sodero agreed that a vast majority of CPG suppliers were not ready with an online strategy. Anderson said it’s imperative that suppliers define what success means for them. It could mean a certain market share in a category, perhaps the No. 1 share of washing machine sales in stores. Then they need to also define what success will look like with their online business. “It could be the No. 5 market share in stores has a goal to be the No. 2 player online, and this is a threat to the business of No. 1. The No. 5 player might be willing to ride along as the category grows online and accept a lower profit margin while it also has to invest in the immature channel,” Anderson explained. He adds that in some categories there will be suppliers who choose to support fewer retailers over time as more of their sales move online. Anderson and Sodero don’t think anyone can predict when a category will flip over to online dominance, but it’s evident that more are doing so all the time. “Roughly $1 out of every $10 is spent online for retail, and at some point that will double and double again. E-commerce is only 20 years old. In each of the past five years online sales have grown by double digits, while in-store sales struggle to grow from 2% to 3% annually. The law of big numbers still favors traditional retail, but there is no let down in strong annual growth from online sales. And someday there will be a saturation point, but we are nowhere near it yet,” Anderson said. Sodero said in the meantime categories from razors, to dog food and groceries are being disrupted from startups like Dollar Shave, Wag.com and Blue Apron, which didn’t exist five years ago. He said these online startups chip away at the market share of retailers like Wal-Mart and their suppliers.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

RedEye Your weekend plans. Delivered. News Opinion Commentary Commentary: Melania, Ivanka and the Trump family's definition of public service Melania Trump’s libel lawsuit Trump’s attorneys are "seeking redress for the commercial harm done to her, her commercial brand and her business opportunities." (Feb. 7, 2017) Trump’s attorneys are "seeking redress for the commercial harm done to her, her commercial brand and her business opportunities." (Feb. 7, 2017) Timothy L. O'BrienBloomberg View We can all thank first lady Melania Trump for giving us a clearer sense of what she and her family are looking for from their stay in the White House. In court papers Melania filed on Monday as part of a libel lawsuit against the parent company of the Daily Mail, she said that the British tabloid and website, by falsely reporting that she had once worked as a prostitute, caused the first lady to miss "major business opportunities" and "multimillion-dollar relationships." The lawsuit, first reported by the New York Post on Tuesday evening, said Melania's missed deals would have involved such products as "apparel, accessories, shoes, jewelry, cosmetics, hair care, skin care, and fragrance." Melania's role as first lady to President Donald Trump would have offered her a "once-in-a-lifetime" opportunity to cash in on such deals, the lawsuit noted, but the reputational damage done by the Daily Mail had disrupted those plans. Amid a little swirl of social media attention for the case Tuesday, Melania's spokespeople said that reporters and others had misinterpreted the language in the suit and that the first lady had "no intention" of trying to profit from her White House role. Fortunately for another Trump, the president's daughter Ivanka, nothing yet seems to have unwound similar opportunities afforded by being a member of one of the world's most famous families, with regular access to two of the world's most powerful men (her father and her husband, Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to the president). (However, on Feb. 5, Nordstrom announced it would no longer carry Ivanka's clothing label.) Shortly after Trump was elected, Ivanka's eponymous accessories company drew criticism for aggressively marketing jewelry she had sported during a "60 Minutes" interview about her and her father's White House plans. More recently, Ivanka has stated that she would part ways with the Trump Organization and her own business by moving to Washington and taking a "leave of absence" from the companies. But as ProPublica reported last week, she has yet to make public documentation proving that she has formally left her businesses. Meanwhile, she has invited titans of industry for dinner at her Washington home, where the guests included the chief executive of Wal-Mart. Ivanka's clothing line is sold in Wal-Mart stores, and Wal-Mart has an interest, inevitably, in a number of decisions that the Trump White House will make, including corporate tax rates, trade agreements and labor regulations. Ivanka seems to be blissfully unaware that any of this might appear, at a minimum, unseemly. On Tuesday morning, she tweeted a photograph of herself attending a White House meeting with her father's business advisory council, a panel of prominent corporate executives assigned to give her father guidance. The taint of possible self-dealing that clings, vaguely, to Ivanka's comings-and-goings, is a step more pronounced with Kushner. Privy to innermost White House decisions, he has yet to effectively distance himself from the Kushner family's real-estate operations: He simply moved his assets into a trust controlled by a less-than-disinterested party, his mother. And then we come to the Trump patriarch himself, who freely mingles his family's business interests and the authority of the presidency. Just Wednesday morning, he defended Ivanka's wallet and lit into Nordstrom because the retailer recently dropped his daughter's clothing line due to weak sales, tweeting: "My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!" Trump's tweets are just mood music in this discussion, though. Of greater note is that the president still hasn't released his tax returns or truly separated himself from the Trump Organization's business affairs. By these decisions, Trump, who isn't subject to federal conflicts-of-interest laws, has ignored decades of Oval Office tradition meant to reassure the public that the president — unlike Melania — isn't looking for "multi-million-dollar relationships" in the White House. For students of good government, Melania's lawsuit does have an upside: the discovery process. Since she is seeking at least $150 million in damages stemming from missed business opportunities, the lawyers representing the Daily Mail should eventually avail themselves of their discovery powers to secure each and every email, communique and document about White House business prospects that the Trump parents and children discussed. They should also subpoena the Trump family's tax returns and banking records while they're at it. If President Trump isn't inclined to release his tax returns or be more transparent about his business dealings, then maybe the courts can help him along.

America's consumer watchdog agency is sitting in the crosshairs of the White House. A D.C. court is expected to rule soon on whether the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is constitutional. But no matter the outcome, critics of the agency have begun laying the groundwork for the Trumpadministration to make dramatic changes to the institution at the heart of President Barack Obama's overhaul of the financial system. "The CFPB's structure is based on the idea that government is unlimited and rights are dependent on the special dispensation of the experts who know better than the American people," Republican Sens. Ben Sasseof Nebraska and Mike Leeof Utah wrote in a recent letter to the White House. "I'm just focused on doing my job, which is protecting consumers.  The rest of it is above my pay grade." -Richard Cordray, director, CFPB The debate is centered on the agency's director, Richard Cordray, who is serving a five-year term that ends in 2018.The CFPB is an independent government agency that is funded through the Federal Reserve. Though Cordray is a presidential appointee, the White House has limited power to remove him. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the law that established the agency, the head of the CFPB can be dismissed only for "inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office." Cordray's protected status is now being challenged by PHH, a New Jersey mortgage servicer that the CFPB had fined $109 million. In November, a panel of judges in the D.C. Circuit Court ruled that the agency lacked critical checks on the director's power. But any changes to the CFPB's structure are on hold while the court decides whether a broader set of judges should weigh in. Industry experts say the answer could arrive any day. If the court denies the CFPB's request, Trump could dismiss Cordray almost immediately — and the agency would have little recourse to appeal to the Supreme Court under a Republican administration. "I'm just focused on doing my job, which is protecting consumers," Cordray told CNBC on Wednesday on his way to Capitol Hill. "The rest of it is above my pay grade." White House already lining up a new boss Even if the court grants a broader review and the case remains in limbo, opponents of the CFPB have begun building the case for removing Cordray anyway. The White House has already begun meeting with potential replacements, such as former Rep. Randy Neugebauer, R-Texas, who had proposed legislation that would gut the agency. "Dodd-Frank was a piece of massive government overreach," a senior administration official said. "Some of the rules may have even been unconstitutional in creating new agencies that don't actually protect consumers. They might have just created more additional work. We're looking to deal with those." Critics point to a laundry list of CFPB actions that they say could warrant removal under existing Dodd-Frank standards: Republicans have excoriated the agency for the cost of renovating its building, for example, and for an alleged lack of diversity among its employees. "I think the president has at least a credible claim for removal." -Brian Knight, senior fellow, Mercatus Center They also argue the agency overstepped its authority in issuing rules intended to address discrimination in auto lending that also affect car dealers — an industry that was specifically carved out from the CFPB's purview. "I think the president has at least a credible claim for removal," said Brian Knight, as senior fellow at the libertarian Mercatus Center at George Mason University. "They've been extremely aggressive, and the courts have been pushing back on them pretty consistently." show chapters Rep. Hensarling: Dodd-Frank is to household finances as Obamacare is to health care    Tuesday, 7 Feb 2017 | 3:15 PM ET | 03:27 Still, dismissing Cordray would be virtually unprecedented, even for a White House that prides itself on jettisoning tradition. No one has been fired by a president since the Supreme Court in 1935 set those standards of inefficiency, negligence or malfeasance for removal, according to an analysis by the left-leaning Americans for Financial Reform. "The slipshod rationalizations thinly disguising an underlying desire to remove a strong enforcer surely do not justify making him the first official ever to be removed by a president for cause," wrote Brian Simmonds Marshall and Veronica Meffe. Meanwhile, House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, is about to introduce a new version of his bill to undo Dodd-Frank that is also expected to take aim at the CFPB. In an interview on CNBC on Tuesday, he said he planned to work closely with the White House on that effort. "Dodd-Frank broke all its promises," he said. "I certainly hope to do my part on Capitol Hill to return us to a healthy economy and unclog the arteries of lending." Taking on the CFPB could prove politically precarious, however. Trump's campaign was fueled by populist anger against Wall Street — the same anger that helped lead to the creation of the agency in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The CFPB is the brainchild of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, an outspoken critic of the banking industry who enjoys a 61 percent approval rating in her home state, according to Morning Consult. 'Consumers deserve to have him serve' Consumer advocacy groups have also vowed to fight any attempts in the courts or on Capitol Hill to dismantle the agency. "Director Richard Cordray has proven to be a tireless and effective leader, and consumers deserve to have him serve out the rest of his term working on their behalf," said Debbie Goldstein, executive vice president at the Center for Responsible Lending. It remains unclear how quickly and aggressively the White House may move. Oliver Ireland, a partner at the law firm Morrison Foerster, said the Trump administration may wait until after the court weighs in on whether to review the PHH case again. In addition, Trump's nominee to lead the Treasury Department, Steven Mnuchin, has yet to be confirmed, and several other key Cabinet posts remain unfilled. Those positions could take precedence, Ireland said. But he said it was likely that the president's attention would eventually land on the consumer watchdog. "It seems to me there are a lot of moving parts here," Ireland said. "I think it's very hard to handicap that from a distance."

Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Spencer Green | AP 2012 More than 100 retailers including Wal-Mart and Target as well as key trade associations are launching a new coalition aimed at fighting a Republican proposal on how imports get taxed, which they believe would harm their businesses. The National Retail Federation, along with the American International Automobile Dealers Association, the National Grocers Association and others are joining forces to form Americans for Affordable Products, which will run a campaign to educate consumers and show lawmakers that the so-called Border Adjusted Tax plan would lead to higher prices of as much as 20 percent on everyday items including clothing, food and even gas. The diversified group, which also includes such companies as Nike, Best Buy, luxury conglomerate LVMH and Dollar General, is trying to make their opposition heard even while Congress and the president try to sort out exactly what adjustments to put forth. • Related: Trump proposes big export tax, triggering fight with Mexico Congressional Republicans want to eliminate tax incentives that encourage U.S. companies to move overseas, sharply cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, and encourage more factory output at home. But opponents say the plan would have a harmful rippling effect, causing companies to even lay off workers. The proposal — spearheaded by House GOP Speaker Paul Ryan and Missouri Rep. Kevin Brady, the top Republican on the House tax-writing committee -- would constitute the most sweeping reforms to corporate taxes in at least three decades. Trump has dismissed the cornerstone of the House GOP plan as "too complicated" and has been touting a 35 percent levy on imports. Yet his spokesman appeared to put the tax back in play last week by proposing a 20 percent tax on goods from Mexico and "other countries we have a trade deficit with" to pay for a border wall. "There's a rush to get this done in Congress. We want to make sure our voices are heard," said David French, chief lobbyist for the National Retail Federation, which has been dispatching members to meet with different levels of the new administration as well as lawmakers. Details of the consumer campaign are still being worked out, according to a spokeswoman at the retail trade group. A lot is at stake. Nearly all such items that U.S. shoppers buy are either wholly or partly produced overseas as companies have sought the cheapest way to make goods. And with online competition and shoppers trained to find the best deals, U.S. retailers haven't had the power to raise prices on many goods for several years. "I'm losing sleep. I am scared out of my mind," said Rick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, which has signed on to the coalition. It is a family-owned company based in Vernon Hills, Illinois that makes educational toys and employs 150 people in the U.S. He estimates that under the GOP plan his federal tax rate would soar to 165 percent from 39.6 percent, he would have to raise prices by 10 percent to 15 percent to stay viable, and would have to lay off employees. Retail industry leaders "describe it as an existential threat," said Stephen Lamar, executive vice president at the American Apparel & Footwear Association, another member of the coalition. "When they crunch the numbers, it really affects things like solvency and profits." Lamar said companies would likely have to pass along higher prices to shoppers, who wouldn't tolerate it. Companies say they also would have to try to squeeze suppliers for more savings and fear they might even have to lay off workers or close stores. George Feldenkreis, CEO of Perry Ellis International, estimates that he would have to raise prices on his clothing anywhere from 20 percent to 25 percent if the border tax went into effect. Shirts currently range in price from $14.99 to $49.99. "People who are thinking about it don't know the consequences," Feldenkreis said. He added that the company would also have to lay off workers. "It's not just a retail implication," said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the National Retail Federation. "We know it's going to impact Main Street in many ways. It could be autos, manufacturing." The proposal would essentially tax corporations based on where their products and services are consumed, rather than on their incomes. In that way, it is similar to a sales tax. House GOP supporters such as Ryan and Brady say that would eliminate the incentives for corporations to use complex schemes to shift their incomes to lower-tax jurisdictions. To ensure the tax is focused on U.S. sales only, it would exclude a company's export sales. But the cost of imported goods would be taxed. The tax could raise as much as $1.2 trillion in revenue over the next decade, which would help pay for the steep tax cuts included in the House GOP plan. Proponents say if the plan is enacted, the dollar will increase in value by as much as 25 percent, resulting in cheaper imports and offsetting the impact. But many economists and industry executives worry the dollar wouldn't adjust, or certainly not fast enough. And Lamar said a shirt label saying "Made in China," doesn't tell the whole story. Seventy percent of the value of the garment supports U.S jobs in areas like design and logistics, he said. • More: Shaming firms that export jobs has worked for Trump so far Other groups also oppose the border-adjusted tax, including Americans for Prosperity, a conservative organization backed by billionaires Charles and David Koch, who typically donate generously to Republican campaigns. The tax would likely encourage companies to produce more in the U.S., or buy more of their parts and components in the U.S. Some companies say they could make those changes in order to avoid raising prices too much. Robert Sands, the CEO of Constellation Brands, said on a recent conference call that the company could purchase more natural gas from the United States, rather than Mexico, which it uses to make glass for the Corona and Modelo beer it imports. "It's those kinds of things that we are looking at, planning on, if this comes to pass," Sands said. "We don't expect consumer demand for our product to be affected." Woldenberg, though, whose company makes 98 percent of its products overseas, says shifting his manufacturing to the U.S. isn't an option. In the last three years, he said he tried twice to find some U.S. molders interested in making its products here, but it wasn't financially feasible. He also doesn't believe that changes in foreign exchange rates will offset the costs of the plan for retailers. And even if it did, he says relief wouldn't come right away. "I am not going to play the currency markets to run this business," he said. "I want to make toys. I am not a forex trader." Stay Informed Subscribe to our politics newsletter.

By Amanda Christman / Published: February 8, 2017 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     A Hanover Township man is accused of scamming people from out of state was caught in Rush Township, court papers say. Felix A. Tejeda, 35, allegedly fabricated stories of the victim’s relatives’ arrests while requesting the victims wire transfer money to him for bail. Then Tejeda would allegedly pick up the money at Wal-Mart in Hometown until Rush Township police and store employees apprehended him Jan. 31. Law enforcement in Ithaca, Michigan, contacted Rush Township police Jan. 13 stating a male contacted a couple in Michigan claiming he was a legal aide in Pennsylvania and that their grandson was involved in an accident and needed $5,000 bail, according to arrest papers. The male gave the victims the names of two bail bondsmen and told them they would have to wire $2,500 from two different Wal-Mart stores since the company only allows a person to receive $2,500 per day. As instructed, the victims sent the $5,000 in separate transactions from stores in the towns of Alma and St. Johns, police wrote, but when they got in touch with their grandson later that day they found they were duped. Knowing then that their grandson wasn’t in trouble in Pennsylvania, they contacted their local police. The couple managed to cancel one of the transactions but by the time they found out they were being scammed the first transaction had already been picked up at Wal-Mart in Hometown by Tejeda who used a fake identification card, court papers state. He faces three counts each theft by unlawful taking, access device fraud, theft by deception and identity theft — all third-degree felonies. Tejeda was arraigned by Magisterial District Judge Stephen Bayer, Tamaqua, who set bail at $25,000. Unable to post the money, he was taken to jail. achristman@standardspeaker.com We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.

Brown outlines plan to keep Elliott State Forest publicly owned Mohawk High School to drop Indian mascot On a date, off-duty Eugene police officer hands firearm, ammunition and badge to drunk female companion, investigation finds 2017 Eugene Community Garden application deadline is Monday Iranian baby with heart defect to undergo surgery soon More Local »   A woman suffered serious injuries after being stabbed Monday night during a string of armed street robberies in Eugene involving four people believed to be in their late teens, Eugene police said Tuesday. Police arrested four people in connection with the robberies Tuesday afternoon, after a brief chase in a stolen pickup truck that led from the Walmart parking lot on Green Acres Road to Fir Acres Drive and Willagillespie Road. It was there that officers “forcibly stopped the vehicle,” according to Lt. Doug Mozan, meaning an officer purposely crashed into the truck in order to stop it. One of the four people inside­ the truck attempted to run after the crash, but that person was quickly captured and arrested, along with the three others in the vehicle, Mozan said. Their names and ages have not been released. The vehicle matched a description that one of the nine robbery victims provided to police Monday night, according to Sgt. Jay Shadwick. The license plate, he said, was only one digit off from the number provided by the victim. A Eugene police crime prevention specialist spotted the stolen Toyota Tacoma near Walmart on Green Acres around noon Tuesday — about 14 hours after the robberies across town — with the four suspects inside and called for additional officers, police said. The stabbing victim, 25, was injured just after 10 p.m. Monday in the 200 block of West Seventh Avenue near Lincoln Street. She was taken by medics to PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center at River­Bend in Springfield, according to dispatch logs. Police said the woman’s injuries were life-threatening. At noon Tuesday, her condition was critical but improving, Shadwick said. Police said the stabbing occurred amid a series of robberies in Eugene, from Franklin Boulevard east of Matthew Knight Arena, west to Jefferson Street near Jefferson Park. The first robbery was reported at 9:31 p.m. in the 400 block of East 19th Avenue. Minutes later, a second robbery was reported in the 2000 block of Patterson Street. In each case, a white female described as 5 feet 4 inches tall with short dark hair pulled a knife on the victim, while a white man believed to be 6 feet 3 inches tall and a black man about 6 feet tall stood nearby, police said. A fourth person was involved, police said, but no description of that suspect was provided. In the third reported robbery, the woman was stabbed. Afterward, two more robberies were reported, first at West 18th Avenue and Jefferson Street, then at 2025 Franklin Blvd. In total, nine people were robbed during five or possibly six incidents, Shadwick said. The robbers demanded anything the victims had, from wallets to headphones. At least two people refused to hand over belongings and ran away, he said. Shadwick said the string of armed robberies was “very out of the ordinary” for Eugene. Follow Chelsea on Twitter @chelseagorrow. Email chelsea.gorrow@registerguard.com.

ABC11 Together highlights the strength of the human spirit, good deeds, community needs, and how our viewers can help WTVD By Stephanie Lopez Tuesday, February 07, 2017 07:05PM APEX, North Carolina (WTVD) -- Apex firefighters are sending out a big thank you after a good Samaritan took care of their grocery bill for them. The firefighters at Apex Station 2 didn't see who did it, but they want them to know how much it meant to them. A Walmart receipt with a handwritten note saying "Thank you for all you do," is one of the only clues the firefighters have about who paid for their groceries Sunday, when they got an emergency call and had to leave everything behind. "The nice employees at Walmart told us that it was a lady behind us in line," Station 2 Engineer Jeffery Jones said. "But we never did actually get to meet her and tell her, thank you." The groceries were already purchased and waiting for them when they returned after the call, and they said that means a lot to them -- especially when they spend every moment of the day getting ready for the next emergency. "Making sure our gear is ready, making sure the truck is completely in service," Jones said. Want more ABC11 Together stories? Get the ABC11 News App When asked how big of a difference can a few minutes make when it comes to their response time, firefighter Andrew Baker said. "It can sometimes mean life and death." By the time they get the call, to the time they're on the road, the station strives to spend no more than 90 seconds to get going. "It's important to us," Baker said. "We take a lot of pride in trying to get out." Now they want the mystery shopper to know she's always welcomed at Station 2. "We would like to tell her thank you from the bottom of our hearts," Jones said. "It makes me feel like there are still good people in the world," Baker said. "You don't get that every day, so to me it gives you a warm feeling inside to know that people really do care about you."

(WAVY) — A local veteran is giving back to the community by replacing old and worn American flags with new ones. Ryan Thorpe served in the Marine Corps and is currently a sheriff’s deputy. He first got the idea behind his nonprofit organization, Operation Restore Glory, in 2012. “Driving down 58, I saw what was an old grain silo. It’s kind of fallen down now. There was a flag and it was all torn up,” he said. Thorpe says he went to Wal-Mart, bought a new flag and returned to the home, where an older man lived. “He said [the flag] was for his son, who passed away because he was killed in Iraq. I asked if I could replace the flag. He said, ‘Sure.’ I did that and now I kind of have a calling to continue to do that,” Thorpe said. Now, Thorpe travels to other homes in the Hampton Roads area for his organization. He says replacing worn flags shows respect that’s missing within younger generations — especially those who stomp on flags. “Everybody thinks the flag represents the government. The flag doesn’t represent the government,” he said. “The flag reflects the people and the people are the government. The flag should be respected.” When Thorpe receives old flags, he takes them to local Boy Scout troops to retire them. “It’s also going to teach the younger generations coming through the Boy Scouts to respect the flag and they’ll teach their friends. It will go from there,” Thorpe said. Thorpe hopes that by starting this organization, others will also come to appreciate something he says symbolizes all of America. “Yes, there are some negatives through our history as a country, but we have way more positives and it’s because of that flag,” he said. Thorpe and his wife are raising money to cover costs for flags, which he says costs about $18 each.

The Freeport-based outdoors retailer will freeze its defined-benefit pension plan and boost its 401(k) savings contributions to all 5,000 workers, including 1,000 out-of-state store employees who were not previously eligible for the full pension, company officials said. The changes, which go into effect next year, were in the works before Steve Smith's arrival as CEO last year and unwanted publicity surrounding board member Linda Bean's campaign donations, officials said.  Last month, #GrabYourWallet called for a boycott of LL Bean and 38 other stores including Walmart, Macy's and Bloomingdales, because Bean contributed $60,000 to a political action committee supporting then president-elect Trump.

Bean spoke out about the boycott to the FOX Business Network, calling it 'bullying'. 'They want to control how we spend our money, what we buy, where we buy it. That's wrong, it's un-American.' Trump later tweeted support of Bean's statements with a thank you. He also urged customers to buy LL Bean. 'Thank you to Linda Bean of L.L.Bean for your great support and courage. People will support you even more now. Buy L.L.Bean. @LBPerfectMaine,' he wrote on Twitter.  In response to the boycott at the time, company chairman Shawn Gorman, who is the great-grandson of founder LL Bean, released a statement on Facebook. 'We were disappointed to learn that Grab Your Wallet is advocating a boycott against L.L.Bean solely because Linda Bean, who is only one of 50+ family members involved with the business, personally supported Donald Trump for President.  'We are deeply troubled by the portrayal of L.L.Bean as a supporter of any political agenda. Bean (pictured) spoke out about the boycott, calling it 'bullying'. 'They want to control how we spend our money, what we buy, where we buy it. That's wrong, it's un-American' In response to the boycott at the time, chairman Shawn Gorman, who is the great-grandson of founder LL Bean, released a statement on Facebook that said the company was 'disappointed to learn that Grab Your Wallet is advocating a boycott' because Bean supported Trump  'L.L.Bean does not endorse political candidates, take positions on political matters, or make political contributions. 'Simply put, we stay out of politics. To be included in this boycott campaign is simply misguided, and we respectfully request that Grab Your Wallet reverse its position,' the statement read.  But recently the company said the changes are a part of a broader look at all aspects of the business, which could lead to changes that affect shoppers. L.L. Bean currently offers free shipping on everything, and its 'satisfaction' guarantee is so liberal that it's led to abuse of the return policy.  Company officials said they will have more to say later this year about shipping and efforts to combat fraudulent returns.

Share this article Share The privately held company expects to reduce its workforce by about 500 workers — about 10 per cent — through early retirement incentives, said Smith. Other employment changes include more flexible time off, paid parental leave and paid eldercare support, benefits employees have been seeking, he said. The employment changes were announced by Smith in a memo and in meetings with workers Thursday. Gorman said such decisions 'weigh heavily' on the family-owned business. But he said they're necessary for the company to remain competitive. 'Without a healthy core business, it's really hard to satisfy any of the stakeholders,' he told The Associated Press.  Recently the company said the changes in personnel are a part of a broader look at all aspects of the business, which could lead to changes that affect shoppers. The privately held company expects to reduce its workforce by about 500 workers through early retirement incentives 'So the move is designed to get us to a more competitive and modern benefits package that allowed us to be sustainable for the foreseeable future.' The pension move is no big surprise in a challenging retail environment. L.L. Bean's sales were flat in 2015, and growth for the five years before that was slow. Nationwide, the private sector has been eliminating pensions.  In 2015, about one-fifth of Fortune 500 companies offered a traditional or hybrid defined benefit plan to new hires, down from 60 per cent in 1998, according to business consulting firm Willis Towers Watson . Smith said the goal is to return L.L. Bean to the strong growth levels the company experienced in the 1980s and 1990s. 'As long as your expenses are growing faster than your sales, then you're not able to invest in growth,' Smith said. 'What we're focused on is getting to where we're back in growth mode.'

By Nicole Rojas February 9, 2017 23:31 GMT US markets closed in the green following promising moves by President Trump regarding taxesReuters US stocks closed in the green on Thursday (9 February) after US President Donald Trump promised a "phenomenal" announcement regarding his tax plan in the next few weeks. The 45th president has vowed to cut taxes, which is expected to have a stimulative effect on asset values. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 118.06 points, or 0.6%, to close at a record 20,172.40. The blue chips gauge managed to hit an intraday all-time high of 20,206.36, according to MarketWatch. Gains were led by Nike Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc, with the help of of Goldman Sachs, which closed up 1.4%. The S&P 500 jumped 13.20 points, or 0.6%, to settle at 2,307.87 after reaching an all-time high of 2,311.08. The index traded within a 1% range for the 38th consecutive session, marking its longest streak on record. Financial sector saw big performers, according to MarketWatch. Morgan Stanley jumped 2.2% and Bank of America Corp saw an increase of 1.8%. Over on the Dow, JP Morgan Chase & Co also rose 1.6%. Energy stocks also saw gains, with a 1.3% rise in the price of crude oil to $53 (£42.40) a barrel. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite hit a closing record for a third straight session, ticking up 32.73 points, or 0.6%, to close at 5,715.18. According to MarketWatch, the last time the three major indexes all closed at records was 25 January. "I think it's a combination of investors feeling more confident that some tax package will get worked on. But I think that we also have lower interest rates recently and solid earnings," Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, told CNBC. Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth, added: "Those comments about taxes, the markets have been looking forward to that for a while, and that helps. At least we're not talking about Ivanka [Trump]'s dress line over at Nordstrom's." In the latest economic reports, weekly jobless claims dropped by 12,000 to 234,000 and wholesale trade data for December revealed a 1% increase on inventories, CNBC reported. US Treasury yields fell, with the benchmark 10-year yield rising to 2.39% and the short-term two-year yield by 1.18%. Following a sale, the 30-year bonds yielded 3.016%. Gold prices dropped 0.2% to $1,236.80 (£989.44) an ounce. The US dollar surged against a basket of currencies, jumping more than 1% against the yen. By 6.15pm EST (11.15pm GMT), the USD was at £0.80.

Contacto Casa   Financiera Espectáculos Tecnología Deporte Mundo Salud Sábado, 11 Febrero, 2017 Mundo Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered Double XP Weekend 2 Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered Double XP Weekend 2 Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered Double XP Weekend 2 Eleena Tovar | 09 Febrero, 2017, 18:50 This offer also extends to the Glacier White console bundle - which again comes with Call of Duty - and is available exclusively from Walmart. Here are more details on the bundles from a post on the official PlayStation blog. All of the consoles come with an updated DualShock 4 controller and 500GB hard drive, so while you could argue they're not directly competing, they're going to look pretty darn competitive on store shelves next to Nintendo's new piece of kit. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered's 1.08 patch added something insidious alongside numerous fixes. From Sunday, February 12 through Saturday, February 25, you'll be able to pick up the 500GB Uncharted 4: A Thief's End bundle, 500GB Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare bundle, or 500GB Glacier White Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare bundle for $249.99, which is $50 off the slimmer PS4's regular price. With games like Horizon Zero Dawn, Persona 5, and NieR Automata coming to the PS4 soon, there couldn't be a better time to scoop one up. Let us know down below in the comments.

KelleyLauderdale County Detention Center  Preston Kelley, 23, of Florence, sent his grandmother a photo that made it look like he was being held captive in the woods in Tennessee, Lauderdale County sheriff's investigator Lt. Brad Potts said. Kelley told the grandmother if she didn't go to Wal-Mart and send him $1,000 through a money gram, he would be killed, Potts said. "He never got any money," Potts said. "The grandmother came straight to us." Investigators began probing the case as a possible kidnapping Monday. Later that day, Kelley was taken into custody on a first-degree extortion charge. "We take all instances like that serious," Potts said. "But, eventually we determined it was all a hoax and he was trying to extort her for money." Potts said the local drug task force is familiar with Potts, who has crossed its path in the past. "Family is the ones people tend to prey on, particularly elderly relatives," Potts said.

The multi-rotor creates a map as it flies, and when a student clicks on a previously visited part of the map, it’s able to fly back to that spot without human intervention and without GPS. (MAGICC Lab) Robots may be the stuff of science fiction novels and movies for some. But to BYU electrical and computer engineering Professor Randy Beard, they’re an exciting reality. “(Robots have) so many, many useful applications,” Beard said. “We work on really fun and innovative problems, and we get to do things that you can see work.” Beard is a director of BYU’s Multiple Agent Intelligent Coordination and Control Lab, also known as the MAGICC Lab. Established in 1999, its primary goal is developing a robot that directs itself. “What we’re trying to do is … make robotics systems more intelligent and more autonomous and more usable,” Beard said. “We’re writing computer algorithms that … fly robots.” Those flying robots are unmanned aerial vehicles, more commonly known as drones, and the main research focus of the MAGICC Lab. The lab focuses on small aircrafts with a wide variety of uses. All flight tests are approved through BYU Risk Management. “We work in the area where we’re looking at small vehicles, things that can be hand launched … but have autonomy,” Beard said. “You have civil applications like law enforcement and border control … things like wildfire surveillance … pipelines and power-line surveillance. All of that can be automated with unmanned air vehicles.” In addition to the MAGICC Lab, Beard works with the Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems, a coalition of five universities and 23 companies that develop drones, according to center’s operations manager Rose Allen. The center and MAGICC Lab sometimes work together, but they’re also distinct organizations with separate projects. Tim McLain is another director of the MAGICC Lab and the director of the Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems. McLain, a mechanical engineer and BYU professor, worked on underwater vehicles while completing his doctorate degree, which influenced his understanding of drones. “Interestingly, some of the fundamental dynamics or governing behaviors … that govern how these vehicles work (have) similarities between underwater vehicles and aircraft, and ground vehicles too,” he said. McLain said drones have historically been fixed wing aircraft developed by the military, but now some companies are looking at them for commercial and communication applications. “Parcel delivery is something that’s being looked at very intently by Amazon, Wal-Mart, DHL and other people,” McLain said. “Facebook is looking at having high altitude (drones) that would be solar powered and stay up for long periods of time, and they would be used to pipe high-speed internet to parts of the world that don’t have the infrastructure … for internet.” Drones have the potential to change the aircraft industry in the long term, but not before other technologies develop, according to McLain. “I think the way that will evolve is we’ll see self-driving cars come along first,” McLain said. “Once we’re convinced of the safety of that … then I think you’ll see large unmanned aircraft used for parcel delivery … and then finally passenger aircraft.” McLain said although he doesn’t consider drones safer than planes flown by people, quite a bit of passenger flight is already automated, with the pilot simply overseeing processes like takeoff, landing and navigation. “(The pilot) is just watching to make sure nothing bad happens,” McLain said. “(But) even under challenging conditions, the automated landing systems can do a better job than the pilots can, so in that sense, the automation that we have currently is better and safer than what a pilot can do.” Both Beard and McLain said no one should be afraid of drones invading their privacy. “You’re probably much more likely to have an invasion of privacy from someone putting a webcam on your fence than trying to fly a drone around,” Beard said. “Drones are very loud and they don’t fly a long time, so I think that privacy concerns are overblown.” McLain said he agrees new legislation is not necessarily needed because existing laws already protect people. “I think unmanned aircraft are a technology just like … the internet,” McLain said. “We would all be pretty sad if the internet were taken away because it was viewed as a potential harm. … There will be a lot of good stuff that comes from unmanned aircraft.” Some of that “good stuff” is already being developed by doctorate electrical engineering student David Wheeler, who has worked four years in the MAGICC Lab. His research involves teaching multi-rotors to fly when GPS is unavailable. Past MAGICC Lab projects include a “Tailsitter” that lands vertically and an airplane that’s able to calculate the locations of targets on the ground while flying. A team of undergraduate students is currently preparing to compete in the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems-Student Unmanned Aerial Systems competition. To Wheeler, the future is drones. “I think over … the next thirty, fifty years … they’ll be interacting with us regularly to help us and shape the way we live our lives,” Wheeler said. McLain shared Wheeler’s optimism. “(It’s great) to work with young people that are so capable,” McLain said. “The best part is just seeing something new work for the first time, coming up with an idea that has the potential to provide a useful capability to an end user, something that’s marketable and valuable to people. I think the capabilities that will develop will enhance people’s lives and ultimately save lives too.” Tags: BYU, drones, kaitlyn bancroft, magicc lab, Robots, tim mclain, uavs, unmanned aerial vehicles Kaitlyn Bancroft 0 0 0 0 0 Related News Latter-day Saints and Catholics team up for Christmas film Husband-wife team bring puppetry prowess to Provo Life as a BYU tour guide Archives Archives Select Month February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 February 2011 January 2011 September 2010 June 2010 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005 January 2005 December 2004 November 2004 October 2004 September 2004 August 2004 July 2004 June 2004 May 2004 April 2004 March 2004 February 2004 January 2004 December 2003 November 2003 October 2003 September 2003 August 2003 July 2003 June 2003 May 2003 April 2003 March 2003 February 2003 January 2003 December 2002 November 2002 October 2002 September 2002 August 2002 July 2002 June 2002 May 2002 April 2002 March 2002 February 2002 January 2002 December 2001 November 2001 October 2001 September 2001 August 2001 July 2001 June 2001 May 2001 April 2001 March 2001 February 2001 January 2001 December 2000 November 2000 October 2000 September 2000 August 2000 July 2000 June 2000 May 2000 April 2000 March 2000 February 2000 January 2000 December 1999 November 1999 October 1999 September 1999 August 1999 July 1999 June 1999 May 1999 April 1999 March 1999 February 1999 January 1999 December 1998 November 1998 October 1998 September 1998 August 1998 July 1998 June 1998 May 1998 April 1998 March 1998 February 1998 January 1998 December 1997 November 1997 October 1997 September 1997 August 1997 July 1997 June 1997 May 1997 April 1997 March 1997 February 1997 January 1997 December 1996 November 1996 October 1996 September 1996 August 1996 July 1996 June 1996 May 1996 April 1996 March 1996 February 1996 January 1996 October 1994 ABOUT US ADVERTISING BRIMHALL WEBCAM CONTACT US COPYRIGHT / PRIVACY SUBMIT NEWS TIPS UNIVERSE ARCHIVES (PDF) UNIVERSE JOBS Site Login © 2016 The Daily Universe - Brigham Young University

Leach was hired in early December of 2011, leaving him two months to reshape the class. How'd WSU do? On paper, things looked good back on Signing Day 2012, but multiple players washed out. However, there were a handful of guys who will be remembered forever in Cougar history. Here's the breakdown. This class could best be described as up and down. The attrition is there, but the remarkable things some were able to accomplish is more than noteworthy.  For WSU's 2012 class, it featured 13 3-star prospects, one 4-star recruit and plenty of 2-star guys. The class includes the most prolific receiver in the history of not only WSU, but the Pac-12 as well. But the class was also highlighted by a large number whose stay in Pullman was all too brief, or never made it to campus at all. Here's the full breakdown" • Receiver Gabe Marks: Ok, we'll go ahead and chalk this one up as a major win for Leach. Marks was at one point an SMU commit, but flipped his verbal to the Cougars. Things worked out pretty well for him at Wazzu. Marks became the Pac-12's all-time leader in receptions this fall with 316 grabs. Not bad at all. • DL Destiny Vaeao: He didn't truly make his presence known until his senior season but when he did, it was something to see. Cougar fans won't forget the way he played down the stretch of his final year. He didn't get drafted, but signed with the Eagles as a free agent and not only made the team, he got in there on Sundays and made plenty of big plays in the NFL his rookie season. • Defensive tackle Robert Barber: Barber's senior year was dominated by headlines away from the field. He was involved in an off-campus fight over the summer and was eventually suspended by WSU mid-season. However, he won in the courts, WSU reinstated him and most importantly, he graduated in December. Despite the off-field issues, Barber was a stud nose tackle for the Cougs from this chair. He's hoping to join Vaeao in the NFL next season. • Linebacker Jeremiah Allison: Was there a player WSU fans loved more than Allison while he was in Pullman? The outgoing linebacker was a steady presence on the field, but won hearts over with his love for Cougar nation off of it. The hard-hitting 'backer was a leader for the defense while out on the Palouse, helping WSU to a huge turnaround in scoring defense his senior year in 2015. https://twitter.com/JeremiahMA8/status/712802452488265730 Here's the breakdown of the rest of the class. • Cornerback Ray Ford: Ford was a highly touted prospect and arrived to WSU with plenty of promise. However, his stay in Pullman was a short one. He left barely after fall camp started because he wasn't cleared by the NCAA. He never returned, going the JC route before winding up at Boise State for his final two seasons. In 2016, he played in all 13 games with one start, and broke up a pair of passes and made two tackles against WSU. • Quarterback Austin Apodaca: Apodaca was known in high school for having a rocket for an arm. He was Connor Halliday's back-up QB early on, but he wasn't long for Pullman. He transferred out of the program and ended up at New Mexico.  • Defensive end Austin Brown: Brown was a late addition to the class. However, his WSU career was a short one. He was kicked off the team following an alleged charge of third-degree theft at the Pullman Walmart. • Linebacker Justin Sagote: Sagote was a JUCO product out of the College of San Mateo. He finished his career in strong fashion at WSU, including a career-high 12 tackles in a late-season upset win at Arizona. • Offensive lineman Sam Jones: Jones was also a JC recruit who signed with WSU. However, he never made his way to campus.  • Safety Taylor Taliulu: Taliulu caught heat from fans on the message boards and he struggled at times at WSU. But he was still the best option available -- he never started less than 10 games each of his final three seasons and he came into his own during his senior campaign, logging 49 tackles in 2015, fifth on the team, along with six pass break-ups. • Offensive lineman Niu Sale: Sale battled weight issues from the moment he set foot on the Pullman campus. He didn't last long at WSU, eventually transferring out.  • Defensive tackle Ioane Gauta: Also a JC recruit, Gauta spent two years in Pullman, with his final season being the one fans will remember him for. The 6-3, 285-pounder was a factor at times in the trenches.  • Wide receiver Robert Lewis: Lewis grayshirted and arrived to WSU in January of 2013. He was also an SMU flip, like Marks. Lewis just wrapped up his junior year, hauling in 33 balls for 294 yards and three touchdowns. Has anyone forgotten about his block in the Utah game two years ago, which freed up Vince Mayle for a long touchdown? • Linebacker Kache Palacio: Palacio was a beast for WSU. He recorded 57 tackles as a junior and 33 as a senior. He had six sacks his final year in Pullman. He landed with the Seattle Seahawks' practice squad last season. • Wide receiver Brett Bartolone: Bartolone blew up his freshman season, earning All Pac-12 Honorable Mention honors. However, his promise was left unfulfilled as injuries led to an early retirement from the game. • Running back/defensive back Teondray Caldwell: Caldwell got his start at WSU as a running back, however, he got moved to defensive back his junior year. Caldwell quit the team midway through that season. • Punter Mike Bowlin: Bowlin was nothing short of a disappointment for the Cougars early on in his career. The JUCO product bounced back, though, and averaged 40.6 yards per punt to end his career. He made 23 starts. • Linebacker Khalil Pettway: After a strong freshman season on the scout team, Pettway had to hang up his cleats due to medical retirement. • Cornerback Alex Jackson: Jackson was recruited by WSU as a receiver, but made his way to the defensive side of the ball. However, he was suspended indefinitely by Leach as a second-year freshman and ended up leaving the program. • Linebacker Feddie Davey: Davey saw plenty of action on special teams as a second-year freshman, but left the program shortly before the 2013 bowl game vs. New Mexico. • Defensive end Keith Ewing: Ewing had high hopes of making a difference for the WSU program, but left the program in 2013. • Running back Theron West: West never truly was able to break through as a key contributor for the Cougars, but he did have a breakout game against Colorado State in the 2013 New Mexico Bowl. WSU lost that one in a heartbreaker, though. • Linebacker Jacob Tuivaiave: The in-state 'backer signed with WSU, but was unable to qualify academically. He never made his way to the Palouse. • Offensive lineman Pierson Villarrubia: Villarubia landed in Pullman all the way from Louisiana. However, his stay in the Northwest was short lived as he transferred to be closer to home. • Offensive lineman Eduardo Middleton: One Middleton found his footing, he wasn't going to be displaced.  Middleton became on of the most productive members on the o-line in the Leach era, posting 38 straight starts to cap his Washington State career. • Offensive lineman Denzell Dotson: Dotson spent one year in Pullman before leaving the program. • Offensive lineman Sam Flor: The O'Dea product logged four career starts at WSU and was the No. 2 center behind Riley Sorenson in 2014 and 2015 but chose to hang up his cleats and start his post-football life with one year of eligibility still remaining before the 2016 season. • Offensive lineman B.J. Salmonson: The pride and joy of Nooksack Valley High is entering his senior year at WSU. Salmonson hasn't been a consistent starter, but is no stranger to PT for the Cougs. In an interview with CF.C this week, offensive line coach Clay McGuire said Salmonson is expected to compete for the starting job at right guard. • Defensive back David Bucannon: The younger brother of CouGreat safety Deone Bucannon, now with the Arizona Cardinals, David transferred out of the WSU program in 2015.

Reuben Gregg Brewer (TMFReubenGBrewer) Feb 9, 2017 at 3:23PM Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (NYSE:HP) has an impressive dividend record, particularly when you take into consideration that it operates in the highly cyclical oil and gas services industry. The problem for investors, though, is that a dividend decision a few years ago obscures the income story here. This is one stock where the trend isn't what it seems, and a little more analysis is needed to understand Helmerich & Payne's true dividend potential. 44 years and counting Helmerich & Payne has increased its dividend each and every year for 44 consecutive years. That's nothing short of impressive, putting it up there with companies like Consolidated Edison, Kimberly-Clark Corp, and Wal-Mart. That's rarified air for sure, and it shows a deep commitment to returning value to shareholders. Add in the current yield of roughly 4%, and income investors are sure to be interested. Image source: Helmerich & Payne, Inc. But you can't just stop there. You have to look deeper. For example, Helmerich & Payne's dividend streak looks even more impressive when you consider that it operates in the highly cyclical oil and gas drilling services business. To give you an idea of just how volatile that business is, at the end of fiscal 2016, only 25% of the company's drill rigs were being used by customers. At the end of fiscal 2014, just as oil prices were getting set to tumble, that number was nearly 90%. You have to ask yourself how a company with such variability in demand can keep upping the dividend year-in and year-out? The answer is that it doesn't. Helmerich & Payne has historically increased dividends in the middle of a calendar year, which means it can hold the dividend steady for up to 10 quarters and still maintain its annual streak based on nothing more than timing. In fact, it did just that for eight quarters, when oil prices were tumbling in mid-2014. It only started upping the disbursement again in August of 2016. That doesn't mean you shouldn't own Helmerich & Payne stock; it just means you have to take the dividend history with a grain of salt. Some other reasons it was able to protect the dividend are a conservative culture that favors a low debt load (long-term debt is just 10% of the capital structure) and impressive cash flow. Cash flow, the lifeblood of a company, is worth a deeper look. HP Capital Expenditures (Quarterly) data by YCharts. Helmerich & Payne builds expensive drill rigs. It then depreciates those costs over the useful lives of the rigs, a non-cash charge that hits earnings. When demand for rigs is high, the expense of building new rigs offsets the depreciation add back on the cash flow statement. In a downturn, though, the company stops building rigs, and the depreciation add back flows right into the company's bank account -- leaving it with plenty of cash to keep paying the dividend. So, Helmerich & Payne's dividend streak isn't as clean as it looks, but it is built on a solid foundation. The stock really is worth a closer look for income-focused investors. It's not that big That said, there's one other metric that needs to be considered, here. Over the past three years, Helmerich & Payne's annualized dividend growth rate is 28%. Over the past five years it's 60%. And over the past decade, the dividend grew at an annualized rate of 32%. If that doesn't knock your dividend socks off, nothing will!   HP Dividend Per Share (Quarterly) data by YCharts. But somehow, those numbers don't make much sense, particularly when you consider that the dividend was static for eight quarters in a row between 2014 and 2016. Here's what's going on: In calendar year 2012, the company more than doubled the quarterly dividend from $0.07 a share to $0.15. And then in 2013, it increased it again, this time going from $0.15 a share per quarter to a $0.50. Those were huge increases that are unlikely to be repeated. Prior to that span, the dividend was usually increased just a few pennies a year. And since 2014, the dividend has basically been increased just a few pennies a year.   So, the trailing dividend data has to be taken with a grain of salt, too. In fact, the increase over the trailing year was less than 1%. And that low single-digit number is far closer to what you should expect over time than 30% or more.

Reuben Gregg Brewer (TMFReubenGBrewer) Feb 9, 2017 at 3:23PM Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (NYSE:HP) has an impressive dividend record, particularly when you take into consideration that it operates in the highly cyclical oil and gas services industry. The problem for investors, though, is that a dividend decision a few years ago obscures the income story here. This is one stock where the trend isn't what it seems, and a little more analysis is needed to understand Helmerich & Payne's true dividend potential. 44 years and counting Helmerich & Payne has increased its dividend each and every year for 44 consecutive years. That's nothing short of impressive, putting it up there with companies like Consolidated Edison, Kimberly-Clark Corp, and Wal-Mart. That's rarified air for sure, and it shows a deep commitment to returning value to shareholders. Add in the current yield of roughly 4%, and income investors are sure to be interested. Image source: Helmerich & Payne, Inc. But you can't just stop there. You have to look deeper. For example, Helmerich & Payne's dividend streak looks even more impressive when you consider that it operates in the highly cyclical oil and gas drilling services business. To give you an idea of just how volatile that business is, at the end of fiscal 2016, only 25% of the company's drill rigs were being used by customers. At the end of fiscal 2014, just as oil prices were getting set to tumble, that number was nearly 90%. You have to ask yourself how a company with such variability in demand can keep upping the dividend year-in and year-out? The answer is that it doesn't. Helmerich & Payne has historically increased dividends in the middle of a calendar year, which means it can hold the dividend steady for up to 10 quarters and still maintain its annual streak based on nothing more than timing. In fact, it did just that for eight quarters, when oil prices were tumbling in mid-2014. It only started upping the disbursement again in August of 2016. That doesn't mean you shouldn't own Helmerich & Payne stock; it just means you have to take the dividend history with a grain of salt. Some other reasons it was able to protect the dividend are a conservative culture that favors a low debt load (long-term debt is just 10% of the capital structure) and impressive cash flow. Cash flow, the lifeblood of a company, is worth a deeper look. HP Capital Expenditures (Quarterly) data by YCharts. Helmerich & Payne builds expensive drill rigs. It then depreciates those costs over the useful lives of the rigs, a non-cash charge that hits earnings. When demand for rigs is high, the expense of building new rigs offsets the depreciation add back on the cash flow statement. In a downturn, though, the company stops building rigs, and the depreciation add back flows right into the company's bank account -- leaving it with plenty of cash to keep paying the dividend. So, Helmerich & Payne's dividend streak isn't as clean as it looks, but it is built on a solid foundation. The stock really is worth a closer look for income-focused investors. It's not that big That said, there's one other metric that needs to be considered, here. Over the past three years, Helmerich & Payne's annualized dividend growth rate is 28%. Over the past five years it's 60%. And over the past decade, the dividend grew at an annualized rate of 32%. If that doesn't knock your dividend socks off, nothing will!   HP Dividend Per Share (Quarterly) data by YCharts. But somehow, those numbers don't make much sense, particularly when you consider that the dividend was static for eight quarters in a row between 2014 and 2016. Here's what's going on: In calendar year 2012, the company more than doubled the quarterly dividend from $0.07 a share to $0.15. And then in 2013, it increased it again, this time going from $0.15 a share per quarter to a $0.50. Those were huge increases that are unlikely to be repeated. Prior to that span, the dividend was usually increased just a few pennies a year. And since 2014, the dividend has basically been increased just a few pennies a year.   So, the trailing dividend data has to be taken with a grain of salt, too. In fact, the increase over the trailing year was less than 1%. And that low single-digit number is far closer to what you should expect over time than 30% or more. A great company despite the dividend confusion None of this is meant to suggest that Helmerich & Payne is a bad company. When it comes to oil and gas drilling services, it's a top-notch name.

Citizens for a New Hospital Now will host speeches, offer information and provide hot chocolate and cookies at the site of the proposed new $44.5 million hospital, across from Walmart in the Apple Blossom Center, just off Highway 97A. The campaign needs 60 percent approval from voters for a $20 million bond request in a special election on April 25. The rest of the money to build the hospital will come from donations and a loan. On Saturday, those gathered will attempt to outline the footprint of the proposed building with a human chain, and get aerial photos using a drone. More information about the hospital proposal is available at newhospitalnow.com. Reach K.C. Mehaffey at 509-997-2512 or (javascript required to see email).

The group, which includes former Secretary of State James Baker, former Secretary of State George Shultz and former secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson, says that $194 billion in revenues would be generated in year one — a figure that it expects to increase to $250 billion a decade later. That money would then be returned to the American people in the form of a “dividend,” although separate versions of the idea have suggested it go toward funding newer technologies to reduce emissions. “If you look at the priorities of President Trump, our plan ticks every one of his boxes,” said Ted Halstead, founder and president of the council, in a press conference in Washington, D.C., in a story by Scientific American. “It is pro-growth. It is pro-jobs. It is pro-competitiveness. It would balance trade. And last but hardly least, it would be good for working-class Americans.” Who else had input? Gregory Mankiw and Martin Feldstein, former chairmen of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Rob Walton, the former chairman of Wal-Mart, says the New York Times. The council says that it would help the US fulfill its obligations under the Paris climate accord. The New York Times then noted that Secretary Baker is scheduled to meet with members of the Trump administration. Getting the meeting, though, is the easy part: Convincing the Republican-led House and Senate is the hard part, especially under the leadership of Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-KY, who represents a coal state that does not want any further constraints on the product it mines and sells. That’s not to say that lawmakers eventually be couldn’t be convinced, especially because some of the oil giants have come out in favor of putting a price on carbon: ExxonMobil, BP and Royal Dutch Shell, as reported by Environmental Leader. “It’s really important that we Republicans have a seat at the table when people start talking about climate change,” Secretary Baker said, in the Times piece. “I don’t accept the idea that it’s all man made,” he said, “but I do accept that the risks are sufficiently great that we need to have an insurance policy.” In an earlier phone interview, the former EPA chief under George W. Bush and the former Governor of New Jersey, Christine Todd Whitman, told this reporter that many national conservatives are deferential to those scientists who say that global warming is largely a function of man-made emissions, notably from burning fossil fuels. But she admits that such thinkers are generally “moderate” and, by nature, are not as vocal as some of the more extreme members of the party. Such challenges and obstacles, however, are no reason to give up — that the scientists are saying that the worst effects of climate change are yet to come. She adds that the money spent repairing the most recent natural disasters is a glimpse into the future. As a governor, Whitman said that she devoted countless hours and public funds to cleaning New Jersey’s shoreline — investments accompanied by handsome returns in terms tourism dollars. To this end, she says that the United States should take a similar approach and that public investments in newer and cleaner technologies will likewise bear fruit. The former EPA chief says that she is sympathetic to those states whose economies have relied on coal and whose coal miners will be adversely affected. But Whitman says that responsible leadership is about making difficult choices. “One thing you learn when you are in a position to make decisions is that you have to do what is in the best interest of the greatest number,” Whitman says. “The decision will have the same impact on everyone but you have to mitigate the negative impact. I’d rather see us bring the new energy technologies to those states most affected. You cannot walk away from what will have the biggest benefit because there will be people who don’t get as good of a deal. At some point, you have to have leadership.” The nation’s cities, she adds, are at the forefront of adopting sustainability standards — choosing to improve the quality of life and to attract people and jobs — to their regions. Whitman points to major companies that are actively improving their communities by pledging to reduce their carbon footprints, as well as that of their suppliers: Texas Instruments Inc., United Technologies Corp. and WalMart. As Whitman says, the climate may be challenging but the cause has never been more important.

Johnson Controls is the world’s largest automotive battery manufacturer. It supplies 146 million batteries a year to auto makers and to replacement-battery sellers Interstate Batteries and retailers such as Costco, Walmart and AutoZone. Under the deal, Johnson Controls will acquire just under 5 percent of Aqua Metals outstanding shares. The company told the Wall Street Journal that its stake in Aqua Metals is worth about $11 million. “It’s a technology that really aligns well with our growth strategy and the way we want to produce batteries in an environmentally friendly way,” said Joe Walicki, president of Johnson Controls Power Solutions. The agreement also makes Johnson Controls the first licensee for Aqua Metal’s technology, which will enable it to extract lead from used car batteries. It will supply Aqua Metals with batteries to recycle, as part of the Johnson Controls closed-loop network, and purchase metals produced from the recycler’s facilities. In a statement, Dr. Stephen Clarke, chairman and CEO of Aqua Metals, said the partnership will “enable clean and efficient battery recycling around the world.” Johnson Controls told the Wall Street Journal that the US replacement battery market grew 8 percent over the past year. It expects to spend $50 million this year to increase production capacity for conventional batteries by 10 million units annually at eight US plants. Instead of smelting, the most common way to recycle lead, Aqua Metal uses an electrochemical process. The room temperature, water-based recycling method produces ingots of ultrapure lead. Because it uses a water-based process, it eliminates virtually all of the toxic waste issues generated by smelting and is safe for the environment, the company says. Last year Aqua Metals signed an agreement with Interstate Batteries under which the automotive battery distributor sends more than 1 million automotive and other lead-acid batteries to be recycled at Aqua Metals’ AquaRefineries. Interstate Batteries also invested about $10 million into Aqua Metals.   Categories Manufacturing, WasteTags Aqua Metals, Batteries, closed loop, Johnson Controls, rwrr Leave a Comment Cancel reply NEWSLETTER NEWSLETTER SIGNUP Join 100,000+ subscribers who gain a competitive advantage with our news and analysis.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Near-record Growth Propels Wind Power Into First Place as America’s Largest Renewable Resource Near-record Growth Propels Wind Power Into First Place as America’s Largest Renewable Resource Posted on February 9, 2017 by CSRwire Press Releases, Events and Reports in Press Releases American wind power just achieved its second strongest quarter ever for newly installed energy generating capacity according to a new report released today by the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA). Wind surpassed hydropower dams to become the largest source of renewable electric capacity in the U.S., and the fourth largest overall.  Business leaders from General Motors and the U.S. wind energy industry met Thursday morning to mark this historic milestone and release AWEA’s Fourth Quarter 2016 U.S. Wind Industry Market Report at General Motor’s Arlington Assembly Plant, which will soon be 100 percent wind-powered. “American wind power is now the #1 source of renewable capacity, thanks to more than 100,000 wind workers across all 50 states,” said Tom Kiernan, AWEA CEO. “Growing this made-in-the-USA clean energy resource helps rural communities pay for new roads, bridges, and schools, while bringing back manufacturing jobs to the Rust Belt. With our two-thirds cost reduction over the last seven years, household brands like General Motors, Walmart, and more are buying low-cost wind energy to cut costs and power their businesses. American wind power is on track to double our output over the next five years, and supply 10 percent of U.S. electricity by 2020.” “With more wind energy production and more wind workers than any other state, if you want to know how wind works for America, just ask a Texan,” added Kiernan. At the close of 2016, the American wind fleet totaled 82,183 MW, enough to power 24 million average American homes. And with the addition of North Carolina’s first utility-scale wind farm announced earlier today, there are now more than 52,000 individual wind turbines in 41 states plus Guam and Puerto Rico. GM’s Arlington Assembly Plant produces over 1,000 SUVs a day and is 50 percent powered by wind energy today. Starting in 2018, Arlington Assembly will be GM’s first plant to have all of its electricity needs met with wind energy. The company purchases energy from two Texas wind farms, RES’s Cactus Flats in Concho County and EDPR’s Los Mirasoles Wind Farm in Edinburg. Non-utility purchasers, like GM, Microsoft, and the Department of Defense, represent 39 percent of wind purchased through long-term contracts in 2016, totaling 1,574 megawatts (MW). More than half of that capacity is located in Texas. “At GM, we’re committed to efforts in our facilities that create business value and strengthen communities where we live and work,” said Rob Threlkeld, GM global manager of renewable energy. “Using wind power delivers on this by securing more stable energy costs while reducing our impact on the environment.” While buying low-cost wind energy helps make other industries more competitive, building wind turbines is also big business in the U.S. The wind industry employs 25,000 Americans at over 500 factories in 43 states. This includes 40 wind manufacturing facilities across Texas. In 2016, at least seven companies across the U.S. expanded existing manufacturing facilities to meet growing orders, and GRI Renewable Industries opened a new tower facility in Amarillo, Texas. Over 100,000 American workers now manufacture, construct, and maintain the U.S. wind turbine fleet according to the U.S. Department of Energy. In total, wind supports more American jobs than nuclear, natural gas, coal, or hydroelectric power plants. New growth in the fourth quarter of 2016, announced for the first time today, includes 6,478 MW, the second strongest quarter for U.S. wind power installations on record. For the year, wind developers added 8,203 MW of wind power capacity representing more than $13.8 billion in new investment. With 99 percent of wind projects located in rural areas, much of this investment is flowing to communities that need it most. Rural and Rust Belt America are among the greatest beneficiaries of wind power development. Wind projects in these areas often become the largest contributors to the property tax base, helping to improve schools, roads and other public services. Of the $13.8 billion invested by the U.S. wind industry last year, $10.5 billion was invested in low-income counties. Wind is a new drought-resistant cash crop for farmers and ranchers who host wind turbines on their land. Nationwide, wind projects provide private landowners with more than $245 million in land lease payments annually. Texas landowners receive more than $60 million of that, in many cases helping to keep farms and ranches in their families. Wind power is in high demand from utilities and other buyers because it often provides the least expensive energy available. Wind power can bring costs down further and create American jobs thanks to policy stability that passed in 2015 with bipartisan support in Congress. “Wind power isn’t a red or blue industry, it’s red, white and blue,” said Kiernan. “Low-cost, homegrown wind energy is something we can all agree on. States like Texas and Iowa are leading the way in terms of wind turbines and wind jobs.” Texas is the undisputed leader in wind energy, with approximately three times more wind generating capacity than any other state and nearly a quarter of American wind jobs. The state continues to expand wind power, becoming the first state to pass 20,000 MW of wind capacity last year, which is roughly one-fourth of national capacity. More wind is on the way in Texas. Even with the 1,790 MW installed in the fourth quarter of 2016, there is still 5,401 MW under construction and another 1,288 MW in advanced development. The Texas model for energy development stems from genuine commitment to an “all of the above” energy mix.  Free markets allowed wind to prosper in Texas, creating a low-cost, balanced energy portfolio for the state. Texas has captured $38 billion in wind investment to date and supports up to 25,000 wind jobs today. The state has also benefited from investment by corporate energy buyers who want to site data centers and factories close to the wind farms that power their facilities. A key part of the success story in Texas has been a strong backbone of transmission infrastructure – the power lines that deliver all forms of energy to homes and businesses. Texas’s CREZ (Competitive Renewable Energy Zone) transmission lines and the state’s long-standing recognition that a strong grid is essential for a free market in electricity have become the national model for transmission investments that more than pay for themselves. Looking ahead, transmission projects like Pattern Development’s proposed Southern Cross Transmission Project will allow Texas to benefit by exporting its abundant wind energy to customers in the Southeast. Wind power growth is now spreading up from Texas into the Plains states and across the Midwest. In fact, 89 percent of newly completed capacity in 2016 is found in these states. The U.S. offshore wind industry also launched in the fourth quarter of 2016 with the commissioning of the 30 MW Block Island Wind Farm off the coast of Rhode Island. Gulf Island Fabrication in Louisiana manufactured the foundations for the Block Island project, reflecting a broader opportunity for oil and gas suppliers to earn additional business in offshore wind.  As a result of the generating capacity of wind turbines in the U.S. standing at over 82,000 MW, greater than the 80,000 MW of hydropower generating capacity, wind power is now the fourth largest source of generating capacity, behind gas, coal, and nuclear.  For a library of up-to-date library images of wind energy, please use this link: http://www.awea.org/MediaCenter/content.aspx?ItemNumber=7244 ### AWEA is the national trade association of the U.S. wind energy industry. We represent 1,000 member companies and over 100,000 jobs in the U.S. economy, serving as a powerful voice for how wind works for America.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Post-Holiday Consumer Insights Study: Spending Increases Are Predominately Online Post-Holiday Consumer Insights Study: Spending Increases Are Predominately Online Posted on February 9, 2017 by Top News US Full Feed in Press Releases TrendSource Trusted Insight, a market research and strategic consulting firm, compared consumers’ pre-holiday purchase intentions, influencers, and preferences with their post-holiday realities in the annual Post-Holiday Consumer Insights Study. (PRWEB) February 09, 2017 In the 2016 Pre-Holiday Study , TrendSource Trusted Insight offered some hope for brick-and-mortar retailers. Nearly half (49%) of respondents who reported being turned off by the crowds and inconvenience of in-store shopping indicated they could be enticed to venture into brick and mortar by events such as sales and promotions. Unfortunately, this appears to be a case where intentions did not translate into action: Only 20% of these crowd-weary shoppers ultimately were drawn into physical stores during the holiday season. The progressive movement towards online retail that we have been tracking for four years really appears to have reached new heights in 2016. Obviously such news, while distressing for many retailers, is a benefit for those with a powerful online presence. First and foremost among these is Amazon, which once again was a top-three purchase destination in the three most popular gift categories—fashion/apparel, electronics, and toys. In electronics and toys, Amazon enjoys a comfortable 6% lead over its nearest competition, Best Buy and Walmart, respectively, and in fashion/apparel only trails Kohl’s 4%. More interestingly, however, Amazon also increased its the percentage of shoppers between 2% and 3% from pre-holiday intention to post-holiday reality. That means that, as shopping deadlines loomed and consumers felt the rush of the holiday season upon them, more of them turned to Amazon than had intended to, speaking to consumers’ perceptions of its convenience and practicality. How else did pre-holiday intentions compare to post-holiday reality and what trends can be identified by analyzing this study alongside data from 2015? Other topics include, what devices and platforms are most popular in online shopping, how many people bought gifts for their pets, and how effective are celebrity endorsements?

(WAVY) — Police are searching for a man and woman in connection with a robbery that led to a wild pursuit. Shortly before 1 p.m. Thursday, Virginia Beach Police were called to the WalMart parking lot on Phoenix Drive for a robbery report. The victim, Nicole Loftus, told 10 On Your Side she was returning her shopping cart when she observed a stranger opening her car door. “My purse was on the floorboard [of the driver’s seat],” Loftus said. “She just went right in, grabbed my purse.” Loftus said she shouted out at the woman and chased after her. The suspect bolted into a nearby pick-up truck. A man was behind the wheel. “I got a hold of her jacket, the truck continued to drive, dragging me. Holding on to her, she punched me, she kicked me, eventually I had to let go, they were going too fast.” Soon after, police spotted the pick-up truck, described as a dirty, lifted, newer model maroon Ford F250 truck with large tires and body damage with Virginia license plate VRB-5677. Photo courtesy: VBPD Photo courtesy: VBPD A K-9 unit tried to stop the vehicle near Holland Road and Lynnhaven Parkway, but the driver refused. The officer pursued the truck into the Green Run neighborhood. Police said the suspect struck two occupied vehicles, including the K-9 officer’s. The suspect then fled towards South Independence. 10 On Your Side spoke to two witnesses, who were stopped there at the intersection with Princess Anne Road. The light had just turned green and John Cotthaus was preparing to turn. “Corner of my eye, I saw a big truck barreling through the intersection,” John Cotthaus said. “I got really shaken. If I would have went through, the car would have been done.” Chilita Galloway was also preparing to turn but fortunately stayed put. “I’m like, ‘Oh my God, he just ran a red light, what the heck is going on?’ And then the cops right behind, and then it occurs to you, holy crap, this is a pursuit.” Galloway had a second encounter with the suspect, minutes later, near the intersection of Princess Anne and Dam Neck. “I stop and then boom, it’s that same truck that I saw, coming in my direction,” she said. “I think this is the closest to near death experience I’ve ever had.” According to police, nearby schools went on temporary lockdown as a precaution. The pursuit was eventually called off, for the sake of public safety. Loftus had minor injuries but no one else was hurt, according to police. Many hope the suspects will be taken into custody. “He can’t hide for too long,” Cotthaus said. “He was pretty reckless and hopefully gets what’s coming to him.” Loftus hopes her purse will be recovered. She told 10 On Your Side that her wedding rings were inside. “My husband, we’ve been married for 14 years, but these were new ones he had gotten me, nice ones,” she said. “When we got married, we were young and they weren’t nice but these were new, and they were beautiful, and meant a lot, and… gone.” The driver of the suspect’s vehicle is described as a white male, possibly in his 20s – 30s, with light brown/blond longer hair. The suspect passenger is described as a white female, possibly in her 20s, with brown hair. Anyone with information regarding this crime is encouraged to call Virginia Beach Crime Solvers at 1-888-LOCK-U-UP.

Beach robbery suspect escapes from police during pursuit Posted 2:58 pm, February 9, 2017, by Web Staff, Updated at 09:36PM, February 9, 2017 Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. – Police are looking for a robbery suspect who escaped from police during a vehicle pursuit. On Thursday just before 1 p.m., police received a report that someone was robbed while in the parking lot of the Walmart located at 657 Phoenix Drive. A K9 unit responding to the robbery saw the suspect vehicle, a Maroon Ford F250, near the intersection of Holland Road and Lynnhaven Parkway. The officer tried to stop the vehicle, but the suspect continued to drive. The K9 unit followed the suspect into the Green Run neighborhood. As the K9 Unit was attempting to stop the truck, the suspect hit the K9 Unit car, as well as a civilian car. The K9 Unit kept following the suspect vehicle towards South Independence Boulevard. The officer stopped the chase for safety reasons. Responding units saw the suspect vehicle traveling towards the amphitheater, but then lost sight of the vehicle. Due to the suspect being close to nearby schools, the schools were put on a temporary lockdown. The lockdown was lifted a short time later. The robbery victim sustained minor injuries and was treated at the scene. The driver of the suspect vehicle is described as a white man, possibly in his 20s or 30s, with light brown or blonde hair. The passenger in the suspect vehicle is described as a white female, possibly in her 20s with brown hair. The suspect vehicle is a dirty, newer model Maroon Ford F250 with large tires and body damage with Virginia license plate VRB-5677. 36.823460 -76.071724 Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email The News 3 App Center Get the latest news and live radar on your phone!

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox Business Home Markets Politics Features Media & Advertising Cloud Innovation Business Leaders Technology FBN TV SHOWS ANCHORS & REPORTERS SCHEDULE VIDEO Search After Losing Customers to Walmart and Kroger, Whole Foods Fights to Keep 'Whole Foodies' ADVERTISEMENT On Our Radar Refresh Close On Our Radar Load More After Losing Customers to Walmart and Kroger, Whole Foods Fights to Keep 'Whole Foodies' By Victoria Craig Published February 09, 2017 Retail FOXBusiness Facebook Twitter Comments Print The battle over customer wallets is heating up at grocery stores across the country as the taste for natural and fresh food moves from fringe to mainstream.  Continue Reading Below Whole Foods, the upscale grocer that is given credit for kick starting the organic and fresh trend, has seen six-straight quarters of sales declines at stores open for at least a year. Though the rate of decline slowed a bit in the fiscal first quarter, as the company reported earnings this week that met Wall Street expectations, it revised its 2017 guidance lower amid continued soft sales and nine store closures. Acknowledging the increasingly competitive marketplace, Whole Foods CEO John Mackey said the company has now focused its growth strategy not on acquiring new customers, but holding onto the ones it has. The brand wants to better serve its core customers by using more data to refine its merchandising, pricing and marketing strategies. Mackey explained that at first most large-format grocery stores were focused on competing with the low-cost grocery aisles popping up in Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) across the country, allowing Whole Foods to stoke the higher-priced fresh-not-frozen trend. Now, though, the CEO said as those larger grocers turn their focus more toward organic and fresh options, Whole Foods has seen a drop in the number of consumers willing to make a weekend drive to its stores.  Expand / Contract “We still see that our core customer, the ‘Whole Foodie’ customer, the person that’s really dedicated to Whole Foods Market, they are still coming to us,” Mackey said. “So, part of what our strategy here is … we’re going to do the best job that we can to keep our core customers from migrating back over to those guys.” Investors gobbled up the prospects of more focus from the company that’s struggled to grow its sales and retain customers. After losing momentum in after-hours action following the earnings announcement Wednesday, shares of Whole Foods jumped more than 3% Thursday. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT “We continue to see value in the brand, believe there is a path for improved performance over time (especially with today’s news of accelerated strategic change), and like the stock’s risk/reward,” said a team of Credit Suisse analysts led by Edward Kelly in a note to clients. Food Fight: Aisle 1 The grocery industry has been under pressure for the last year due to a drop in food prices, which, while good for consumer pocketbooks, is bad for corporate profits. For Whole Foods, that meant slightly lower selling prices for items like eggs, beef and organic apples. Though the company said it was able to make up for it a bit with more promotions around those items, and higher prices on avocados, which became a lot more expensive this year due to supply issues in Mexico.  However, while deflation concerns are starting to ease, said Joe Feldman, senior managing director at Telsey Advisory Group, the continued competition from lower-priced grocers will likely continue to pressure Whole Foods in the long run. “If you can get all that at Kroger and it’s the same product but at lower prices, why not? Kroger has stolen back share from the casual Whole Foods shopper,” he said, noting that example is a microcosm of what’s going on in the space as big grocery players are fighting harder to win customers. In fact, Kroger (KR) this week unveiled plans to buy New York's Murray's Cheese, a deal aimed at helping the biggest U.S. grocer ramp up its premium cheese offerings. What’s more, Aldi, which operates in 35 states and targets low to middle-tier shopper, is also upping its game during a time when giants in the industry appear vulnerable. It announced a $1.6 billion nationwide store remodeling plan aimed at enhancing its customer shopping experience. The chain will not only give its basic store design a face lift, but add more produce, dairy, meat and bakery goods like its gluten-free foods brand, liveGfree, and organic SimplyNature products. Aldi also said it plans to open 650 new U.S. stores by the end of next year, targeting new markets and new consumers. But it’s not the higher-end Whole Foods stores Aldi is likely trying to compete with, Fedlman said. “What’s interesting is they locate stores close to Walmart but close enough to traditional grocers that it might draw some of those mid-income consumers,” he explained. “Aldi is trying to get ready to step up their game in the space. It’s going after that low to mid-income consumer and offer them a more complete experience with better fresh products.” Web-Based Competition Heats Up Online orders are also a battleground for grocers as they try to attract younger demographics in densely-populated cities. Whole Foods continues its partnership with same-day delivery-service Instacart, as alternatives continue to coexist like Amazon (AMZN) Fresh, and lower-priced alternatives like Jet.com, with backing from Walmart after acquisition of the e-commerce platform last year. Feldman expects that more established grocery store chains located away from city centers will find success competing on buy online, pick up in store offerings rather than home delivery services. “Logistically, there are a lot of issues and it’s hard to make money doing [grocery delivery],” he said. “Kroger says 95% of its customers drive past a store on their way to work or to pick up their kids. If that’s the case, it’s a lot easier to have someone waiting for you with the basket and keep moving rather than having to set up time to go in and shop.”  More on the Evolving Retail Environment Tiffany Shares Slump as CEO Departs Amid Struggle to Attract Younger Consumers Ralph Lauren Turnaround Hits Snag as CEO Departs After Clash with Founder Consumer Sentiment Comes Back to Earth, But the Sky Isn't Falling Banana Republic on the Brink: Can Gap's Struggling Brand be Saved?

This week we have a $15 deep fryer, a $20 cordless vacuum with same-day delivery, and LED light bulbs for $2.70 each. The Procter Silex 1.5 L Professional Style deep fryer Procter Silex Most things are better deep fried, except your credit card. Fortunately, with this deal, your card will remain cool, as Walmart has the Proctor Silex 1.5 liter professional style deep fryer for $15 , about half the typical price of this low-end deep fryer. You don't get fancy features and the 1.5 liters of oil it holds limits it to single portions at a time, but it's a good pick for those who want to try out some deep-fried deliciousness. If you need to get some grunge out of the car or other tight spots, a cordless vacuum is your best bet. Amazon has a sweet deal on the Black & Decker CHV1510 Dustbuster: $19.99 gets you this cordless vacuum , and you also get free same-day shipping if you spend over $35. So why not buy two? Yup, just slap down your two virtual $20 bills, and later that same day, a smiling* Amazon delivery person will hand over your twin cordless dustbusters. There are a few caveats, though: you have to be within one of the eligible zip codes, which covers 29 major cities. So those of you in zip code 99762 (Nome, Alaska) are out of luck, but those in San Antonio, Texas, are in on this deal. Converting your home lighting to LED? Here's a bright deal: Amazon has a pack of six TCP LED light bulbs for $15.99 . That's just under $2.70 for each bulb that will outlast and outlive your incandescent and fluorescent light bulbs. These are low-end LED bulbs, though: you can't dim them, and they can't be controlled remotely. But that's a sweet deal for a straight-swap bulb that uses much less power: each bulb draws about 6 watts but produces as much light as a 60-watt incandescent bulb. Have you spotted a sweet deal? Let us know in the comments below! *Amazon delivery people are not guaranteed to be smiling, but they generally seem pretty polite in my experience.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 February 2017 by Military News Near-record Growth Propels Wind Power Into First Place as America’s Largest Renewable Resource Texas first in the nation in wind capacity, wind jobs SOURCE: General Motors DESCRIPTION: ARLINGTON, Texas, Feb. 9, 2017 /3BL Media/ — American wind power just achieved its second strongest quarter ever for newly installed energy generating capacity according to a new report released today by the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA). Wind surpassed hydropower dams to become the largest source of renewable electric capacity in the U.S., and the fourth largest overall.  Business leaders from General Motors and the U.S. wind energy industry met Thursday morning to mark this historic milestone and release AWEA’s Fourth Quarter 2016 U.S. Wind Industry Market Report at General Motor’s Arlington Assembly Plant, which will soon be 100 percent wind-powered. “American wind power is now the #1 source of renewable capacity, thanks to more than 100,000 wind workers across all 50 states,” said Tom Kiernan, AWEA CEO. “Growing this made-in-the-USA clean energy resource helps rural communities pay for new roads, bridges, and schools, while bringing back manufacturing jobs to the Rust Belt. With our two-thirds cost reduction over the last seven years, household brands like General Motors, Walmart, and more are buying low-cost wind energy to cut costs and power their businesses. American wind power is on track to double our output over the next five years, and supply 10 percent of U.S. electricity by 2020.” “With more wind energy production and more wind workers than any other state, if you want to know how wind works for America, just ask a Texan,” added Kiernan. At the close of 2016, the American wind fleet totaled 82,183 MW, enough to power 24 million average American homes. And with the addition of North Carolina’s first utility-scale wind farm announced earlier today, there are now more than 52,000 individual wind turbines in 41 states plus Guam and Puerto Rico. GM’s Arlington Assembly Plant produces over 1,000 SUVs a day and is 50 percent powered by wind energy today. Starting in 2018, Arlington Assembly will be GM’s first plant to have all of its electricity needs met with wind energy. The company purchases energy from two Texas wind farms, RES’s Cactus Flats in Concho County and EDPR’s Los Mirasoles Wind Farm in Edinburg. Non-utility purchasers, like GM, Microsoft, and the Department of Defense, represent 39 percent of wind purchased through long-term contracts in 2016, totaling 1,574 megawatts (MW). More than half of that capacity is located in Texas. “At GM, we’re committed to efforts in our facilities that create business value and strengthen communities where we live and work,” said Rob Threlkeld, GM global manager of renewable energy. “Using wind power delivers on this by securing more stable energy costs while reducing our impact on the environment.” While buying low-cost wind energy helps make other industries more competitive, building wind turbines is also big business in the U.S. The wind industry employs 25,000 Americans at over 500 factories in 43 states. This includes 40 wind manufacturing facilities across Texas. In 2016, at least seven companies across the U.S. expanded existing manufacturing facilities to meet growing orders, and GRI Renewable Industries opened a new tower facility in Amarillo, Texas. Over 100,000 American workers now manufacture, construct, and maintain the U.S. wind turbine fleet according to the U.S. Department of Energy. In total, wind supports more American jobs than nuclear, natural gas, coal, or hydroelectric power plants. New growth in the fourth quarter of 2016, announced for the first time today, includes 6,478 MW, the second strongest quarter for U.S. wind power installations on record. For the year, wind developers added 8,203 MW of wind power capacity representing more than $13.8 billion in new investment. With 99 percent of wind projects located in rural areas, much of this investment is flowing to communities that need it most. Rural and Rust Belt America are among the greatest beneficiaries of wind power development. Wind projects in these areas often become the largest contributors to the property tax base, helping to improve schools, roads and other public services. Of the $13.8 billion invested by the U.S. wind industry last year, $10.5 billion was invested in low-income counties. Wind is a new drought-resistant cash crop for farmers and ranchers who host wind turbines on their land. Nationwide, wind projects provide private landowners with more than $245 million in land lease payments annually. Texas landowners receive more than $60 million of that, in many cases helping to keep farms and ranches in their families. Wind power is in high demand from utilities and other buyers because it often provides the least expensive energy available. Wind power can bring costs down further and create American jobs thanks to policy stability that passed in 2015 with bipartisan support in Congress. “Wind power isn’t a red or blue industry, it’s red, white and blue,” said Kiernan. “Low-cost, homegrown wind energy is something we can all agree on. States like Texas and Iowa are leading the way in terms of wind turbines and wind jobs.” Texas is the undisputed leader in wind energy, with approximately three times more wind generating capacity than any other state and nearly a quarter of American wind jobs. The state continues to expand wind power, becoming the first state to pass 20,000 MW of wind capacity last year, which is roughly one-fourth of national capacity. More wind is on the way in Texas. Even with the 1,790 MW installed in the fourth quarter of 2016, there is still 5,401 MW under construction and another 1,288 MW in advanced development. The Texas model for energy development stems from genuine commitment to an “all of the above” energy mix.  Free markets allowed wind to prosper in Texas, creating a low-cost, balanced energy portfolio for the state. Texas has captured $38 billion in wind investment to date and supports up to 25,000 wind jobs today. The state has also benefited from investment by corporate energy buyers who want to site data centers and factories close to the wind farms that power their facilities. A key part of the success story in Texas has been a strong backbone of transmission infrastructure – the power lines that deliver all forms of energy to homes and businesses. Texas’s CREZ (Competitive Renewable Energy Zone) transmission lines and the state’s long-standing recognition that a strong grid is essential for a free market in electricity have become the national model for transmission investments that more than pay for themselves. Looking ahead, transmission projects like Pattern Development’s proposed Southern Cross Transmission Project will allow Texas to benefit by exporting its abundant wind energy to customers in the Southeast. Wind power growth is now spreading up from Texas into the Plains states and across the Midwest. In fact, 89 percent of newly completed capacity in 2016 is found in these states. The U.S. offshore wind industry also launched in the fourth quarter of 2016 with the commissioning of the 30 MW Block Island Wind Farm off the coast of Rhode Island. Gulf Island Fabrication in Louisiana manufactured the foundations for the Block Island project, reflecting a broader opportunity for oil and gas suppliers to earn additional business in offshore wind.  As a result of the generating capacity of wind turbines in the U.S. standing at over 82,000 MW, greater than the 80,000 MW of hydropower generating capacity, wind power is now the fourth largest source of generating capacity, behind gas, coal, and nuclear.  For a library of up-to-date library images of wind energy, please use this link: http://www.awea.org/MediaCenter/content.aspx?ItemNumber=7244 ### AWEA is the national trade association of the U.S. wind energy industry. We represent 1,000 member companies and over 100,000 jobs in the U.S. economy, serving as a powerful voice for how wind works for America.

Despite the contraction, plans for its millennial-friendly 365 concept are on track. JULIE JACOBSON , THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Whole Foods Markets said Wednesday it would shutter nine stores across the U.S., including two in California. Despite the contraction, plans for its millennial-friendly 365 concept are on track. JULIE JACOBSON , THE ASSOCIATED PRESS By BLOOMBERG Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Related stories New Los Alamitos mall, home to 365 by Whole Foods Market, to start construction Village 605 brings Whole Foods - and traffic fears - to Los Alamitos What to expect from Whole Foods' new, low-price grocery chain Whole Foods Market Inc., facing its worst sales slump in more than a decade, is taking a step that would have been unthinkable in its highflying days: shrinking the size of the chain. The grocer is closing nine locations, including two small-format stores in Davis and Encinitas. Two more will close in Colorado, along with outlets in Chicago, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona and Georgia. The company confirmed California closures in news reports at the The Sacramento Bee and The Coast News Group. Whole Foods plans to open six stores during the current quarter, including two relocations. The closures were the most announced by the chain since the last recession was underway in 2008. The company, which about 440 U.S. stores, also said it was abandoning its ambitious growth target and no longer plans to reach 1,200 locations as it tries to get expenses under control. The company also plans to open its 365 concept, a smaller and less expensive brand. A store opened last spring in Silver Lake and another is planned for Los Alamitos. Six straight quarters of declining same-store sales – a closely watched measure – have forced the organic-food grocer to tighten its belt. Whole Foods also gave a forecast for the current year that offered little hope of a quick recovery. “This is a company that owned the space for a long time, but there’s way too much competition now,” said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones. “They’ve done several things to try and drive sales, and it’s just not working.” Same-store sales dropped 2.4 percent last quarter, worse than the 1.7 percent decrease predicted by analysts. The company now expects sales on that basis to decline as much as 2.5 percent this year, compared with an earlier forecast that was closer to break-even. “People were hoping there would be some improvement,” said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s a bit concerning there’s not a reversal happening there.” Mainstream competition Whole Foods has struggled to ward off competition from mainstream supermarkets, including Kroger Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which began offering more organic fare in recent years. And a bout of food deflation has put additional pressure on the entire industry. Some on Wall Street have been pushing Whole Foods to rein in its growth plans, and the store plan was received warmly. The stock gained 2 percent percent to $29.91 at 10:02 a.m. in New York on Thursday. Prior to the drop, it was down 4.7 percent in 2017. Responsibility for the turnaround is now squarely on John Mackey, a co-founder of the company who retook sole leadership last year. He had served as co-chief executive officer with Walter Robb until November. He has an uphill fight ahead. Same-store sales declined 3.2 percent in the current quarter through Feb. 5, a sign its troubles are worsening. The Austin, Texas-based company also said it would no longer be reporting quarter-to-date figures in future reports, meaning investors will have less to go on. Activist threat? Whole Foods’ struggles have fueled speculation that an activist investor could take on the chain, and one of its largest shareholders is said to have to discussed agitating for sweeping changes. For years, Whole Foods offered products that were tough to find elsewhere, and the shares gave investors exposure to the fast-growing market for organic and natural food. But that advantage has eroded in recent years. With sales growth stagnating last year, Whole Foods announced $300 million in cost cuts. But the company is still ramping up spending elsewhere, including on marketing and technology, and that’s expected to offset the cutbacks. It also introduced a new store concept last year aimed at younger, budget-conscious consumers. So far, only three of the 365 locations have opened on the West Coast. The company announced on Wednesday it has signed leases for new 365 stores in Brooklyn, New York, and Oakland. The concept, named after the company’s private-label brand, is seen as a way for Whole Foods to connect with shoppers who perceive the chain’s conventional stores as too pricey. Whole Foods considered turning some of the stores it was closing into 365 locations, but it wasn’t practical, Mackey said. In some cases the company wanted to “thin out” its presence in a particular market, with the hope that it benefits Whole Foods locations nearby. Some of the stores had leases coming up in 2017, and management decided to accelerate the process and close them now. The decision to shutter the nine stores will help boost profits and comparable sales, Mackey said on a conference call. The company is taking a more disciplined approach to growth but still has 80 stores in the pipeline, he said. “We cleaned up the stores we needed to clean up for the time being, and we’re looking forward to moving forward,” Mackey said.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    With the support of President Donald J. Trump, the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin), has declared that Congress will undertake an effort to reform the U.S. Tax Code. The last time such a comprehensive tax reform was undertaken was during the Reagan presidency.  Generally speaking, there is broad agreement that corporate and personal taxes should be reduced, and the consensus view is that, yes, the tax code should be simplified. With most things in Washington, however, things aren’t always that simple and here too there is some disagreement, particularly over the issue of the “border adjustment tax” or BAT. The BAT would raise about $1 trillion over the next ten years that would be a tool in comprehensive tax reform to help lower the corporate tax rate and shift corporate taxation to a “territorial system.”  The BAT, as part of comprehensive tax reform, is also likely to quell Trump Administration demands for tarrifs as part of any tax reform plan.  If the goal is to improve the business climate for domestic companies then the BAT is a viable alternative to tarrifs. As a candidate for President, Mr. Trump argued that the tax code incentivizes companies to move workers and facilities abroad. As we have seen, over the past generation, more and more corporations have uprooted from places like Ohio and Michigan and moved to China, Ireland and Mexico. The House Republicans have submitted a draft tax reform proposal that reduces taxes across the board, calls for simplification, and implements numerous economic pro-growth policies.  The bill includes a provision creating a territorial system of international taxation, and adding a border adjustability component.  That has become ground zero in a battle between lobbyist for Fortune 500 companies – many of which have shipped jobs and facilities overseas.  They are intent on removing this provision from tax reform legislation. As a means of removing the provision, companies like Nike, WalMart and Levi’s have announced the formation of the “Americans for Affordable Products.” The group describes itself as a “coalition of job creators, entrepreneurs, and business leaders united against higher prices on everyday necessities.” It should come as no surprise group members have a long history of closing American factories and opening them overseas. In the early 1980s, Levi’s had 63 manufacturing plants in the U.S.  Today, Levi’s has no U.S. factories save a small factory that produces specialty jeans that retail for $260 – not necessarily affordable..  Nike has pushing production for the U.S. shoe market almost entirely overseas   There are a few thousand workers producing for Nike in the United States, but they’re rapidly disappearing -- there were 13,922 as of April 2014, and Nike’s manufacturing map lists 8,408 as of March 2016[CJV1] . According to a report by the Economic Policy Institute, Chinese imports to Walmart have cost the U.S. 400,000 jobs, mostly in manufacturing. What the House Republicans and the President suggest is the imposition of a provision known as border adjustability. While some, including members of the coalition describe the issue as a tax, proponents including the anti-tax Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) believe that is a mischaracterization.  ATR argues that “border adjustability should also be considered in the context of the many, pro-growth changes in the Better Way plan, and as part of a system that equalizes the taxation of American businesses relative to foreign competitors. It is a dramatic tax cut for businesses and consumers relative to our existing system of taxation, as the plan creates a new, low rate for corporations of 20 percent and a 25 percent rate for pass-through entities.” As part of a larger tax reduction package, the proposal combined with reductions in taxes on small business and corporations would reduce taxes by $2.4 trillion.  In short, if undertaken properly. Border adjustment would protect American jobs while making corporations more competitive.  Another step in helping make America great again.

Gaming News Game Reviews Game Trailers GR Originals Strategy Guides Hot Topics: Resident Evil 7 Kingdom Hearts Destiny Mass Effect Andromeda PS4 Pro Xbox One PC PS4 Bundles Getting Price Drop at the End of the Month By Kyle Sledge | 2 days ago  Sony Interactive Entertainment officially announces its decision to lower the prices of select PlayStation 4 Slim bundle packages at the end of this month. As many gaming fans are likely aware, Sony is still riding high in regards to its successes related to moving PS4 consoles, as the company confirmed just a couple of months ago that system sales have soared past 50 million units worldwide. Now, it seems as if Sony is aiming to move even more consoles by planning to implement a limited time price drop that will only be available for select bundle packages of the PS4 Slim at the end of this month. The news of Sony’s plans to provide a discount on certain PS4 bundles comes from an official blog post from the company, with the tech firm declaring that the price drop is set to take place from February 15 through February 25. With this being the case, fans will soon be able to snatch up both the Uncharted 4 and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare PS4 bundles for $250 a piece, which is $50 cheaper than their original costs. For those unaware, Sony’s Uncharted 4 PS4 bundle contains a console with a 500 GB hard drive and a copy of Naughty Dog’s latest entry in its long-running action-adventure franchise. The Infinite Warfare bundle, on the other hand, similarly features a 500 GB system, a copy of Activision and Infinity Ward’s first-person shooter, but also has a download code for Modern Warfare Remastered. In addition to the two aforementioned PS4 console bundles being included in Sony’s forthcoming price drop, the Walmart-exclusive glacier white Infinite Warfare PS4 bundle is also going to be a part of the deal. As it happens, this specific PS4 bundle that’s available only at Walmart will include all of features of the standard Infinite Warfare package mentioned above, but the system itself is going to be colored white instead of black, and it will come with a matching controller as well. Interestingly, Sony didn’t provide a reason as to why it plans to reduce the cost of its PS4 bundles at the end of February, with the company typically reserving such price drops for consumer holidays like Black Friday, where it offered similar markdowns on its systems packaged with games. Of course, with Sony’s CFO Kenichiro Yoshida recently stating in the company’s latest earnings report that the the new PlayStation 4 Pro is selling better than the PS4 Slim, it’s quite possible that the tech firm is attempting to balance the scales between the sales of its two recently released PS4 variants. Sony’s PS4 Slim bundle price drops are set to begin on February 15, 2017, and end on February 25, 2017. tags: PlayStation, PS4, Sony Load Comments Latest Features Latest News Latest Reviews Latest Videos © 2009-2017 WARP 10 LLC ABOUT CONTACT US PRIVACY POLICY COPYRIGHT ADVERTISE

The Vamousse brand – which is stocked by the likes of Walmart, CVS and Walgreens in the US and by Tesco, Boots and Sainsbury’s in the UK – also gained market share against its major competitors in both territories. The growth comes against a difficult backdrop for the market as a whole in the US. Back in September, TyraTech said it expected Vamousse’s growth to slow in the second half due to a wider “deceleration” in the head lice treatment market in the US. However, the market picked up again at the end of the year to finish almost flat in the US for 2016. Despite the recovery, TyraTech kept a cautious eye on its costs just in case. The North Carolina-based group said it still expects results to be in line with market expectations and its cash position to be in excess of US$1.7mln. Aside from Vamousse, the company’s Guardian non-toxic mosquito and tick repellent is set for a trial run in Kroger stores – the largest grocery chain in the US – for the 2017 season. TyraTech has also finalised the development of its OutSmart non-toxic insect repellent for horses, with an additional patent filing being made for the new formulation. OutSmart was pre-launched by TyraTech’s partner SmartPak at the end of 2016 and the full launch is expected in the second quarter of this year. The outlook for 2017 is positive as well. Even being “cautious” with its expectations, the firm is still confident that it can post double digit revenue growth in the coming 12 months as well. Final results for the year ended 31 December 2016 will be announced before the end of April.

This could be the most original take on vampires since New Line Cinemas made Wesley Snipes’ Blade. The Castlevania video game franchise was one of the most notoriously difficult of its kind, especially early on. The second game on the NES, which is included in the Classic Edition’s library of 30 titles, has been heralded as one of the top ten hardest games of all time. The franchise follows the story of Simon Belmont and his family as they take on the notorious Count Dracula (who never seems to stay dead). At one point, the franchise allowed the player to use Dracula’s son Alucard (whose name is literally his father’s spelled backward) in the fight against the forces of evil. Gamers aren’t so fond of the N64 attempt to take the franchise into the 3D platforming realm. Bringing video game storylines out of the interactive realm usually doesn’t work so well. There is a running trend where film studios attempt to take popular games and turn them into feature films, and all too often, they end up in Walmart bargain bins a year later because nobody wants to own them. Despite what critics have claimed, a few slipped through the cracks of mediocrity, like Silent Hill, Mortal Kombat, and Assassin’s Creed, but it’s movies like Doom and Super Mario Bros. which became the unfortunate norm. ‘Doom’ is part of the reason video games don’t usually become good movies. [Image by Universal Pictures] Animated TV shows based on video games haven’t been done much, but one of the most famous examples was The Super Mario Bros. Super Show. It was a silly collection of animated shorts featuring Nintendo’s most loved characters, hosted by former WWF wrestler “Captain” Lou Albano and Danny Wells as Mario and Luigi, respectively. Nintendo has enjoyed moderate success with follow-up series featuring Kirby and Mega Man, and rival Sonic the Hedgehog has been turned into a few series with less impressive results. While Castlevania becoming a Netflix series might be a good choice, it might be important to remember that the streaming service also debuts plenty of stinkers. For every Stranger Things and Santa Clarita Diet, we get Special Correspondents and Ridiculous Six. Adam Sandler has a four-film contract with Netflix, and he’s currently prepping his third. It appears that movies don’t do as well as TV series when they debut on the streaming service. It’s probably good that Castlevania will be animated. Animation offers much more creativity in visuals and storytelling, where live-action is often limited in what you can do before the audience starts getting tired of the CG. Compare Adam West’s cheesy Batman TV series with the 90s’ animated series, and it’s almost like comparing night and day. ‘Batman: the Animated Series’ could be an example of ‘Castlevania’s tone. [Image by Warner Bros. Pictures] The tendency to go either way with critics is probably why Frederator Studios hasn’t really made a major announcement of the series. According to Techspot, Netflix is calling Castlevania “super violent, dark, and satirical, [and] it would flip the vampire sub-genre on its head.” It’s possible that Belmont will be making subtle references to Twilight and Blade: Trinity, two attempts at vampire storytelling which critics were not kind to. The upcoming animated series revolves around the last remaining member of the Belmont clan taking on Vlad Dracula Tepe as he attempts to save the population of Eastern Europe from extinction. It takes place in medieval times, so it will allegedly maintain the mood which the games brought with them. The series will apparently take notes from the Batman animated series with its “lone hero against a collective evil” approach. Are you excited to see the upcoming Castlevania Netflix series?

Schultz / Courtesy of 50 Eggs Films You may have read about Backpage.com. It’s an online marketplace site in the mold of Craigslist that for several years shared a parent company—partially owned, for a time, by Goldman Sachs—with New York City’s august alt-weekly the Village Voice. Since Craigslist shuttered its own Adult classified section in 2010, Backpage has had a corner on that particular market, commanding 80 percent of online commercial sex advertising revenues in the U.S. And it’s been in the news a lot these past few year after a series of Jane Doe plaintiffs lodged high-profile lawsuits against the website for facilitating the sex trafficking of minors. “Sex trafficking: I think that’s a really antiseptic word,” says the filmmaker Mary Mazzio. “People are like: Oh, sex trafficking. Boo-hoo . . . No, no, no! This is the repeated rape of children under the age of 18. This is modern-day human slavery.” Mazzio, a former Olympic rower and corporate lawyer is lively and animated, even by phone, even talking about a subject as grim as this one. She’s gearing up to release I Am Jane Doe, a documentary about some of the plaintiffs in those lawsuits, who as teenagers—one was only 13—left home, fell into the clutches of pimps, and soon found themselves marketed as escorts on Backpage, where they were sold for sex, sometimes dozens of times a day. Mazzio, who cites estimates that hundreds of thousands of children a year fall victim to sex trafficking in this country, first heard of their plight in her local paper, The Boston Globe. “I remember thinking: Child sex trafficking happens here, literally 20 minutes from where I live?” She was shocked to hear that Backpage had anything to do with The Village Voice, famous for being the sort of progressive indie paper that speaks truth to power (her film includes interviews with many grizzled Voice reporters who are also horrified by the association). And, as a lawyer, she was further flabbergasted by the question of how Backpage, which her film refers to as “the Walmart of sex trafficking,” kept succeeding in getting federal judges to dismiss the suits brought by its child accusers. “That was inconceivable to me,” she remembers. “Federal judges were interpreting a law to basically say it’s legal to host advertisements for children? This is the United States of America! What the F?” The law in question is a provision of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which holds that “no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” That boils down to mean that online publishers aren’t legally accountable for content that third parties post on their platforms. And per the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation, we can thank CDA 230—“perhaps the most influential law to protect the kind of innovation that has allowed the Internet to thrive since 1996”—for making user-generated websites like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Craigslist possible. (We can also indirectly thank Jordan Belfort, aka The Wolf of Wall Street, for its existence: Congress passed CDA 230 after Belfort’s firm Stratton Oakmont sued primordial Internet service provider Prodigy over some possibly libelous anonymous comments posted on a message board; the court ruled in Stratton Oakmont’s favor, and Congress responded with legislation to reverse the decision and to protect fledgling Internet companies from debilitating exposure to lawsuits). Photo: Courtesy of 50 Eggs Films Be that as it may, it’s tough to believe that the legislators who dreamed up CDA 230 could have imagined that their get-out-of-jail-free proviso might be used to defend a company that may have, as lawyers for these Jane Doe plaintiffs allege and as this Senate report details, accepted the business of pimps intent on marketing underage girls, deployed filters that assisted those criminals in operating under the radar of law enforcement, and even when working with anti-trafficking groups, made a practice of reporting only selective cases. (Backpage denies these allegations). With a few exceptions including a judge in Washington State who ruled to hear a case later this year brought by three Jane Does against Backpage, the judiciary seems unprepared to reinterpret the boundaries of CDA 230: In January, the Supreme Court refused to hear a case against Backpage out of Boston (despite an amicus brief filed by marriage-equality star lawyer David Boies); in December, a California judge dismissed charges of pimping and money laundering brought by then–Attorney General Kamala Harris against Backpage shareholders Michael Lacey and James Larkin, and CEO Carl Ferrer (though new charges have since been filed and are pending). It seems that it falls to Congress to fix a problem it helped create: A bipartisan Senate subcommittee led by Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Claire McCaskill is attempting to hold Backpage’s feet to the fire, and the heat they’ve applied is, at least nominally, working. A few weeks ago, just ahead of the release of a damning report about Backpage’s corporate policies, the site dismantled its Adult section. Click on any of the Adult sub-tabs and you’ll get the message, “The government has unconstitutionally censored this content,” and a link to Children of the Night, a charity devoted to “rescuing America’s children from prostitution.” (Lest you feel too good about this development, click over to the dating section, and you’ll get an influx of the same type of ads that once appeared in Adult: they’ve migrated.) This is a complicated moment for free speech and technology in America. We’ve seen a president disavow the legitimacy of mainstream media on Twitter. We’ve seen the proliferation of fake news, and a backlash against Facebook and Google for their failure to regulate those stories. A Florida judge effectively put Gawker out of business when he ruled in favor of Hulk Hogan’s right to privacy in a lawsuit funded by Peter Thiel. And there’s a storm of public outrage brewing over Simon & Schuster’s decision to publish a book by Milo Yiannopoulos, a Breitbart News staffer who spearheaded the blatantly racist harassment of actress Leslie Jones, which got him banned from Twitter. It’s easy to get lost in an intellectual argument about CDA 230 and the freedoms it enshrines, and Backpage, says Mazzio, has “brilliantly” inserted itself into the center of that debate over free speech in the digital arena. (“It’s a really interesting legal issue,” she admits.) But, in so doing, they’ve distracted us from the real victims. She made I Am Jane Doe, Mazzio says, in part to cut through the noise, to force Americans (quite literally, if you watch the film) to face the children who feel their unthinkable suffering was aided and abetted by Backpage, and who are bravely leading by example to “move the needle on this crime.” “What kind of society do we want to be?” asks actress Jessica Chastain in a voiceover (she narrates the documentary). Mazzio and I discuss that, and more, below. Kubiiki Pride and her daughter M.A., a survivor of sex trafficking.Photo: Courtesy of 50 Eggs Films At the point at which you decided to make the documentary, your first concern must have been: Will any of these Jane Does speak to me on camera? Actually I was thinking at the beginning that I would focus on the lawyers, including the Backpage lawyers. Then I asked the lawyers, can I meet your clients? When I met the Jane Doe children and their parents, particularly their mothers, that was a game changer. The children were remarkable. For them to not only participate in the film, but also in a lawsuit where they would be at risk of unmasking their identity? I said, why would you do this? Every kid had the same answer: Well, we didn’t want it to happen to a younger friend, a younger sister. One looked me in the eye, and said, do you have a daughter? I’m doing it for her. Would she do it for me? I was like Oh, shit. This is the story. You argue that that CDA 230 is outdated. Can you explain why? Section 230 was enacted 20 years ago, when the Internet was beginning. I understand the reasons back then. If you fast-forward to today, technology has far outpaced our legal framework. Why does this law continue today when it does not apply to old media? New media is mature, robust, a profitable industry. Why are they not responsible for third-party content when TV stations and The New York Times and any sort of brick-and-mortar, off-line media have to show up in court for third-party content? Section 230 was intended really to save [new] businesses on legal fees. It has nothing to do with the first amendment. Now there have been 300 cases around the CDA, and almost all involve some sort of defamation. This is one of the few cases where criminal activity by the publisher, or the website, is alleged. So this is a really novel kind of case. And yet, the federal judges, especially the First Circuit in Boston, took Section 230 and extended it almost beyond recognition two months ago. They basically said if Backpage had participated and profited, even as a co-conspirator, in the crime of child sex trafficking, they are not liable. It doesn’t make any sense. I was at the hearing when the First Circuit was deciding in November, and [retired] U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Souter asked the lawyer for Jane Doe: Well, what’s the difference between what Backpage is doing to promote a thriving sex trade and a Washington-based car sale? I could not believe that he was comparing the sale of cars to the sale of children. I think part of the problem here is that federal judges are not aware of this crime. They don’t go online. They think they know what’s happening, and they’re just not aware. I don’t know if half of them used the word rape in these cases as it relates to these children. It goes back to child sex trafficking, it’s such a sanitized term. You almost don’t know what it means. You know, you’re seeing this play out in real time right now. Facebook is imploding with this whole fake news crisis. It’s the same argument: Well, we’re not responsible for what people are putting on our site. My argument is: I have no Internet freedom. If I go buy a Teflon pan, I see that Teflon pan everywhere I go. You are tracking me, and it’s so irritating. But if you can track me, and my purchase behavior, are you telling me that you don’t have the algorithms for a simple search technology to find people who are posting children? You do, and in fact the NSA is using that very technology to search for terrorist chatter online. The question to the tech industry, which has been supporting Backpage, is what more can you do to eradicate this harm? We’re also seeing a version of this question about the responsibility of publishers playing out in old media. Should Simon & Schuster publish a book by Milo Yiannopoulos? What responsibility do publishers have not to propagate hate speech? I think Backpage has brilliantly wrapped itself in this freedom of speech argument. This has nothing to do with freedom of speech. We’re talking about criminality; we’re not talking about free speech and defamation. There is no such thing as [truly] free speech. If you paint a swastika on a synagogue, you will be arrested. At some point hate speech becomes criminal activity. You can’t yell fire in a crowded theater. You can be arrested for that. We’ve made a decision as a society that people will be hurt [if that happens]. If we amend Section 230, it has nothing to do with free speech; we’re not touching the First Amendment. We’re just saying: New media, you have responsibilities to defend against allegations that you are involved in criminality, just like old media has. The plaintiff's argument is that Backpage basically coaches pimps and traffickers in how to word their ads so as to not call attention to the fact that they are selling children. What’s the company’s argument for why they do that? Backpage says: Oh, no, we have terms of service that make it very clear what’s legal and what’s not. And that argument sounds really good on its face. But we talked to a Backpage monitor. She said it’s getting more and more nuanced. So there’s a whole system of coding. In the film, we tracked one NGO that tried to put up an ad. Let’s say you try to post a 16-year-old; a filter will come up that’s a dropdown menu for age. If you press 16, it’ll say, oops, now you’re being criminal. Try again. Must be over 18. So they posted an ad that said “hot 15-year-old” in the title, then the dropdown said 18. And the bloody thing went live. Backpage might say, well, we’ll then delete it. But the moderator told me that sometimes it would be five minutes, sometimes five hours. These moderators, they’re often working from home, they’re reviewing 800 ads in an 8-hour, 10-hour day. And one moderator said, “I never understood why ads I tried to delete—because it clearly was a kid—how I would see it the next day on the site.” The cause has gotten support from senators like Rob Portman, John McCain, and Claire McCaskill. Why do you think Congress has gotten it in a way that judges have not? I know this issue came to the attention of senators out of the Jane Doe case in Boston that was taken on by this big white-shoe law firm. It’s fascinating because the Department of Education, Homeland Security, HHS, all of these federal agencies are coming out with anti-trafficking initiatives geared at children. Think about that for a second. The Department of Education is coming out with an initiative. It means they are seeing alarming statistics of children going missing, children being victimized. The Senate, they’ve been accused by Backpage of grandstanding, but if you look at the makeup of this investigative committee, it’s bipartisan. That’s almost unheard of. Nobody in Washington can agree on anything. The fact that they’re starting to come across the aisle is pretty amazing. This is Backpage’s own making. They could have profitably operated under the radar if they had done just a little more. They were in early conversations with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, which said, oh, we need you to do this and this: Low-cost filtering. Don’t scrub identifying marks in your ads. If it’s a kid we want to be able to trace the photo. Really reasonable requests. But Backpage was like, no can do. They then blew off the first Senate hearing. It’s one thing to have this elaborate legal structure in place; it’s another to say, I’m not going to respond to a congressional subpoena. Given how brilliant you feel their legal strategy was, why have they made such dunderheaded moves as not showing up for a congressional subpoena? You’re putting it kindly. You saw the film, you saw [Backpage co-owner] Michael Lacey yawn during the description of the harm to these children [during a later congressional hearing]. I think it’s hubris. I also think the amount of money was so extraordinary that children became collateral damage. Newsweek interviewed adult sex workers who attested that putting Backpage’s escort site out of business will put them in harm’s way. I don’t exactly think we should protect consenting adults above non-consenting children, but it does complicate the question of whether there’s a legitimate need for this kind of marketplace to operate on the Internet. I think that’s a great question. The Jane Does never sought to shut down Backpage. It’s kind of like the tobacco industry. If you have a product that’s doing harm, you have to be responsible for the harm. In the case of Backpage, they weren’t doing enough to eradicate harm. They need to do more. Period. End of story. If people want to smoke, god bless. And for consensual adults, I don’t care! If you want to sell a child, that is a crime. You have a legal background. Why did you feel you could do more as a documentary filmmaker than as a lawyer? I was a real estate lawyer, doing commercial real estate corporate work. But I was also representing the homeless and indigent on a pro-bono basis. Every time I showed up in court, it was the same story, a different face. I remember thinking: I’m not doing anything for anybody. I need to do something bigger on a policy level. That’s where I’m going to be most effective. We have a private screening tonight, a public briefing about the issue of the film tomorrow with members of Congress. I feel I can be so much more effective in helping these children than I could by showing up in court and representing one child. That being said: The lawyers in these cases, they’re doing the heavy lifting. And the credit really goes back to Nacole and Kubiiki [mothers to two of the plaintiffs] and their children. They’re the ones who have had their shoulders to the wheel since 2010. These are very different cases, but it seems relevant that in Florida a judge was willing to rule against an Internet publisher in favor of the rights of Hulk Hogan not to have his sex tape published. But here, judges can’t see past a sweeping law to recognize that an Internet platform may be helping to violate the rights of children. Exactly! Obviously the cases are different, but I think there’s this perception of consent, that, oh, this is the world’s oldest profession. It’s not necessarily malevolent; it’s ignorant. I think there’s a cultural piece that needs to be overcome. Judges need to be educated. I’ve been asked so many times: Did the children make any money? Was this consensual? I’m like, if you’re a minor, it’s rape. This interview has been condensed and edited.

In the last three months of 2016, more than 6,400 megawatts worth of new turbines were installed nationwide, the second strongest quarter on record, according to a new report by the American Wind Energy Association. “With our two-thirds cost reduction over the last seven years, household brands like General Motors, Walmart, and more are buying low-cost wind energy to cut costs and power their businesses,” AWEA CEO Tom Kiernan said in a statement. “American wind power is on track to double our output over the next five years, and supply 10 percent of U.S. electricity by 2020.” The report was released in a ceremony at a General Motors SUV plant in Arlington Thursday, which is scheduled to be completely powered by wind turbines by next year. Right now wind energy accounts for more than 80,000 megawatts of capacity on the U.S. electrical grid, more than is supplied by hydroelectric dams and fourth behind coal, natural gas and nuclear, according to AWEA. More than 20,000 megawatts is located in Texas, which has more than three times as much wind energy capacity as the next closest state.   SHOW MORE View Comments Newsletter Get FuelFix straight to your email.

The GI.biz team discusses the LA show opening its doors to 15,000 members of the public GamesIndustry Staff Thursday 9th February 2017 Share this article Recommend Tweet Share Companies in this article The ESA E3 2017 is going to be open-to-the-public. The Entertainment Software Association yesterday announced that it would sell 15,000 tickets to all comers, giving consumers access to the show floor, panel discussions, and other events at the show that had traditionally been limited to those working within the games industry. GamesIndustry.biz reached out to a number of developers and publishers to get their feedback on the move, but since the move will impact the press as well, we thought it only appropriate to offer some staff opinions in a roundtable format. Brendan Sinclair The ESA's move to open E3 to the public makes perfect sense for a number reasons. First, the internet has allowed developers and publishers to sell their games directly to customers, without the need to go through the gatekeepers E3 was originally set up for, like brick-and-mortar retailers and the press. Social media lets you reach the same enthusiastic young target demographic they always pursued without having to win over magazine editors, and online storefronts let you sell directly to them at a better profit margin without having to worry about how many boxes Walmart will want. Second, members of the public willing to pay $150 to get into the show are going to be far more enthusiastic about what they see than members of the press who develop a thousand-yard stare after a busy week covering way too many games on way too little sleep with way too much pressure to get it all done yesterday. That may sound a bit trivial, but publishers love a circus atmosphere around the show, whether they admit it or not. "There were so many GameStop employees and fringe bloggers crowding the LACC that it was getting difficult for people to conduct their actual business at the show" After a massive E3 2006 with 60,000 attendees, the ESA did its best to reformat the show because it was felt there were simply too many people who shouldn't have been there. There were so many GameStop employees and fringe bloggers crowding the LACC that it was getting difficult for people to conduct their actual business at the show. That led to the reviled E3 2007 in Santa Monica, which led to a return to the LACC and an even-more-reviled E3 2008. With just 5,000 invite-only professionals at the show in 2008, it became clear just how much publishers missed the fans they were trying to keep out. Ubisoft's Laurent Detoc memorably called the show terrible, saying it was "like a pipe-fitters show in the basement." It turns out the unwanted masses they booted from the show were the same ones that made it fun, that cheered and hollered at every big game reveal, that generated a buzz about so much of what was on display. I expect that opening the show to the public will bring back some of that circus atmosphere. Finally, 15,000 tickets at the early bird price of $150 comes out to $2.25 million, or as much as 15% of the money the ESA brings in from a standard E3, based on the ESA's previous Form 990 filings. The show itself might not be as easy to cover for the media, and the crowds will mean more waiting in line for games played on the show floor, but the ESA has clearly--and correctly, in all likelihood--decided those are drawbacks worth enduring. James Brightman As I walked around the Los Angeles Convention Center and the surrounding area at last year's E3, I continually ran into people who were excited about the show - but many of them could not get in because they were not affiliated with the industry in any way. The ESA tried to appease those people by inviting them to a free-of-charge event held in a few tents next door at the LA Live complex. Enthusiasm for that idea was big, but the ultimate result was quite disappointing. "I expected something bigger where we could play some of the big, upcoming titles," one E3 Live attendee told me at the event. Clearly, as Brendan states above, opening the show floor itself to the public and letting these fans get hands-on with big, upcoming titles makes a lot of sense. Publishers are recognizing the value of reaching their audiences directly, and E3's resistance up until now to inviting the public in is likely a big reason why companies such as Electronic Arts took it upon themselves to put on a separate show, EA Play. What doesn't make a lot of sense, in my humble opinion, is to allow 15,000 additional people into the show at the same time as everyone else. Perhaps I'm in the minority, but last year's 50,000+ attendees did make it hard to get around at times. Unlike a lot of the so-called professionals who were blocking my path to get to my next important appointment, I'm actually there to do my job. When people are shoving you, or coming close to even trampling others as they rush to get to the front of lines or to enter the West or South Halls at the start of the day, something is amiss and it's certainly not a professional atmosphere. "When people are shoving you, or coming close to even trampling others as they rush to get to the front of lines or to enter the West or South Halls at the start of the day, something is amiss" My vote would be to simply follow a system similar to the Tokyo Game Show. Offer a couple days to the fans to see all the games, have fun, and then give the industry a chance to do actual business on the next 2-3 days. This approach would not only be more productive for the press and other professionals, but it would quite literally be more productive for the ESA, which could then double or triple that 15,000 tickets figure. Generating $6 million or more is a lot healthier for the industry than $2.25 million. If last year's 50,000 figure is jumping up to 65,000, personally I'm not thrilled with that. On the other hand, maybe the ESA is doing some things behind-the-scenes that I'm not aware of, like instituting much stricter registration policies. Maybe a good chunk of the teenage faces that have been running around the show floor will actually have to buy a ticket. Ultimately, while I don't fully agree with the execution, I am definitely encouraged to see the ESA taking steps to keep E3 relevant. The show has been tweaked many, many times in the past, and it can certainly adapt again if the 2017 version isn't quite hitting the right mix. Christopher Dring E3 remains the most important week in the games industry calendar. Every year people question its relevance, and every year it surprises - even in 2016, when businesses were missing from the show floor, there were more conferences and announcements and overblown stands (whether that was 2K's Mafia III stand, the Zelda world Nintendo created or the Resident Evil mansion). Blink 182 playing the Bethesda party, and entire building next door dedicated to EA games and even a slightly rubbish consumer element - it was a gluttonous and noisy - noisier in fact - than it's ever been. The problem is the viability of the central show in the middle of it all. It was initially a retail event where deals were done and signed at the LA Convention Center, but that rarely happens anymore. It morphed into a press event, but with the growth of direct-to-consumer marketing, that's no-longer so important either. To survive it had to change, and letting gamers in through the door is exactly what it needed to do. It's not as if E3 is some stuffy business affair, either, it's always been full of gamers - just ones that managed to find a way in through the ESA's 'professionals only' rule. "It was initially a retail event where deals were done and signed at the LA Convention Center, but that rarely happens anymore. It morphed into a press event, but with the growth of direct-to-consumer marketing, that's no-longer so important either" There are two natural suggestions that people are making about E3. The first is that the show should follow the Gamescom lead and split the business and consumer areas up. That works really well in Cologne, but then Koelnmesse (the building it is based in) is absolutely huge and has the floor space to enable that. The LACC is not a small place, but it doesn't have that capacity. The second option is to extend the days over the weekend and allow the consumers in once the business has been done. That makes sense logically, but it's asking a lot from those attending the show. E3 is a busy and exhausting week already. Just imagine being a developer making a major announcement on the Monday, and then running a stand from Tuesday right through to Sunday. It'll require extra resource, money and time. Of course, they could have an overlapping business/consumer day on the final day of the show. They could (gasp) try a different venue. But rather than making a dramatic change, it is perhaps the prudent thing to do to invite a decent, but still small, number of consumers to the show. See how that goes down with the publishers, and then make a more dramatic move in 2018. Dan Pearson As someone whose writing career has been focused on covering the B2B angle for the last seven years, with a particular interest in indies and the unusual, I've actually never found that E3 has the biggest impact on my personal schedule - so much so that I've only actually attended once. GDC is probably my equivalent - with its seemingly endless list of talks and the chance of bumping into just about anyone roaming the halls, the Moscone Centre show is always where I've been able to get most done. Yes, E3 generates vast volumes of news and a wealth of amazing trailers, but not publishing previews or reviews (and being highly averse to crowded spaces) means that I've never really found it hugely useful to actually attend. It's actually a lot more efficient for me to watch the big platform and publisher conferences from home, and that's certainly not going to be improved by the addition of 15,000 people who are simply there to enjoy themselves and play as many games as possible. I think it's safe to say that I've had my last E3. Of course, that's an entirely selfish perspective. I still like the fact that E3 happens even if I'm not there myself, and there's no better platform for Sony, Microsoft and to a lesser extent Nintendo, to make a big splash with hardware news and exclusive announcements. But even from a physical remove I understand that many of the problems which E3 was once geared up to address are either no longer issues or more easily solved elsewhere, meaning the show has to evolve to survive. Once you factor in the consideration that social media means 15,000 members of the public are probably going to generate a considerable amount of press copy of their own, even the potential negative impact on press access isn't so much of a blow. This may well be E3 making a change because it's been forced to, but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad decision. Sign up for The Daily Update and get the best of GamesIndustry.biz in your inbox.

That does work very well, and it definitely makes sense. As I mentioned above, the challenge is the size of E3. Koelnmesse is absolutely massive. It's the size of a village. LACC isn't that big, nor does it have the right transport links and parking facilities for an event the size of Gamescom. I think maybe a new venue could be considered, definitely an option for them.

I heard they ran into the problem of the general public walking off with (stealing) equipment (controllers). Also: As reported by Gamespot, an initial batch of 1000 tickets will be sold at a early-bird price of $149 each, before the remaining 14,000 are shifted at $249. "Priced at $250 (or $150 as part of an early bird discount available on February 13), tickets provide access to the show floor, panel discussions, and other events from Tuesday through Thursday of E3 week." http://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-opens-to-the-public-for-the-first-time-ever/1100-6447663/ Edited 1 times. Last edit by Gary LaRochelle on 9th February 2017 3:36pm 0Sign inorRegisterto rate and reply Jeff Kleist Writer, Marketing, Licensing 2 days ago I've always thought that Japanese industry trade shows have given a good example, two days of business, followed by a weekend of public days. However this move comes at least a decade too late, what you're going to do is have a whole bunch of people who drop the price of a new console I'm going to E3, and find out how boring it really is if you don't have a reason to be there. They'll find out that they can't play any of the games they want to play, that two thirds of the games on exhibition have a demonstrator, and that they need an appointment, which they won't get because they're not a level press to play pretty much anything. The only games I've managed to play have been the ones that few people care about, or when I've managed to sneak back in the booth. If I were the ESA, I would put that on the same page you buy the tickets, I make you click through a realities of E3 disclaimer. The ESA basically gave what they should've been to PAX 0Sign inorRegisterto rate and reply Klaus Preisinger Freelance Writing 2 days ago One 30 minute demo on Youtube will reach ten times the people all the public 30 minute demos of one week of gamescom put together. 15.000 tickets does not mean a tradeshow suddenly faces or services the consumer better than before. E3 should not chase after gamescom, it should develop a concept that goes the next step, bringing the show to the consumers' homes better than a couple of livestreams. Why should a company pay for E3, when it can rent some space next door and reach more people with a stream all by themselves? The E3 of the future will have to provide more than a roof and some space. It needs to be a public platform and it needs to be part of a bigger video production. 0Sign inorRegisterto rate and reply Andrew Whitehead Journalist 2 days ago As many have already stated, just opening the show up isn't enough. Like others who've been year after year I can tell you it's already got issues without extra people coming in. For example, the line to watch the Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and I mean watch the trailer in a Zelda-themed cave not play it, had a line of over five hours. To play the game you had to line up basically as soon as the doors opened at 10am, and anyone lining up after 11am was turned away as that was all they could take. Working with the press I got through the whole Breath of the Wild booth in just over an hour, including time for photos and hands-on with the game backstage for 45 minutes. I bet we can expect the same for Mario Odyssey this year - a huge booth and now and even more insane line for the general public. I'm really not trying to sound elitist here, and look if I was outside the industry I'd probably buy a ticket, so I'm not saying people shouldn't go. But based on past experience the lines are worse than Disneyland. I have no issue with the ESA doing this, but I really do get the feeling that without a HUGE re-tooling of the show it's going to annoy a lot of fans. The hype for E3 is huge for gamers, and I think the stark reality of lining up for literally the whole day to play one or two games will be sobering. I hope they shift to the Tokyo Game Show model in 2018. 0Sign inorRegisterto rate and reply Jeremy Meyer Entertainment Columnist 27 minutes ago I love and hate the idea of E3 being open to the public. I agree with the splitting up days or extending the show for a day or two. Now in regards to splitting the show with industry and public areas. Its time to open up Kentia Hall again and make that the industry only area. Also what about the concourse area between South and west hall??

The entrance to Asda's head office in Leeds, as the store has been named named the cheapest supermarket of 2016 18:07 Wednesday 08 February 2017 0 Have your say It appears that after years of underperformance, Asda is finally clawing its way back. The latest Kantar Worldpanel figures show that its sales fell 1.9 per cent in the 12 weeks to January 29 - the only big supermarket chain to see a fall in sales. However this is far better than previous sales declines. Its all time low was last August when it reported its worst ever fall in quarterly sales as shoppers ditched its stores in favour of the discounters, underlining the mammoth task facing new boss Sean Clarke as he attempts to lure back shoppers. Leeds-based Asda said like-for-like sales fell 7.5 per cent in the three months to June 30, which was a lot worse than the 5.7 per cent fall in the three months to March 30 and represents the eighth consecutive quarter of decline. This ​came as a major disappointment to the firm at a time when arch rivals Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons ​were reporting improving underlying sales. However the latest Kantar Worldpanel figures indicate that Mr Clarke is slowing turning the tanker round. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said that Asda’s most important improvement is getting more shoppers through the door. “They are doing a better job at appealing to their core shopper​,” he told the Yorkshire Post. ​“Lower middle class families are returning to the store. They are also keeping a sharp eye on prices.” R​esearch by Which?​ found that Asda was cheaper than its big four rivals - Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons - during 2016. Which? compared the price of a basket of 80 brand​ name goods. The price at ​Asda ​was £154.14​, some £6 cheaper than Morrisons which charged​ £160.19​. Sainsbury’s charged​ £162.11 a​nd Tesco charged £164.37. ​However discounters Aldi and Lidl are not included in the Which? survey as they don’t sell enough branded products. Asda’s problem is that its big four rivals have clear attributes that it lacks. Tesco has size - it is by far the biggest player with 28.5 per cent of the market (Sainsbury’s has 16.8 per cent, Asda has 16.2 per cent and Morrisons has 10.8 per cent). Sainsbury’s has class and quality. Middle class shoppers don’t mind paying extra as they trust Sainsbury’s. Meanwhile Morrisons has heritage and a trusted “farm to fork​“ strategy. People like Morrisons and what it stands for - especially now David Potts is at the helm and returning the firm to its quality and value roots. Asda, which was bought by the world’s biggest retailer Wal-Mart in 1999, has no unique selling point other than it’s cheap. It’s a far cry from the days when it was the consumer’s champion, flogging brand names like Levi’s (when Levi’s were fashionable which tells you how long ago this was) at rock bottom prices much to the fury of the big brand names. Nowadays it lacks the loyalty that Morrisons inspires. It has none of the middle-class, ethical kudos that Sainsbury’s has maintained or the big portfolio of Tesco’s convenience stores. So how is parent Wal-Mart planning to fix this? It’s going to reduce prices further, improve the look of Asda’s stores and enhance product lines. In addition Asda is going to market more Wal-Mart brands as its own at a lower price than rivals. Analysts said the latest Kantar Worldpanel data shows the good work being done by Mr Clarke and former Sainsbury’s executive Roger Burnley. This includes making Asda stores cleaner and less cluttered, with more staff on the shop floor and better availability of fresh produce and meat. Analyst Clive Black at Shore Capital said there are signs that Asda is stepping up product innovation with new frozen and chilled items and more “Extra Special” products. It has also developed complementary services within stores, such as sports retailer Decathlon and butcher McGee’s, while more freedom is being given to individual managers on the layout of their stores. Asda is back on the right track, but it may take several years for it to regain its former glory.

Yes, the concept is called a “carbon tax.” But try to get past the T-word for a second. Because proponents see this as a blue-collar climate policy — one for the Trump era. “This is a pro-growth policy. It is a pro-competitiveness policy,” said Ted Halstead, founder and CEO of the Climate Leadership Council, which released a white paper this week advocating for a carbon tax. “It would rebalance trade, it would promote jobs — and, most of all, it would help working class Americans.” The plan — outlined in a paper called “The Conservative Case for Carbon Dividends” — has the backing of a list of influential GOP old-timers that includes James Baker and George Shultz, former secretaries of state in Republican administrations; Gregory Mankiw, a conservative Harvard economist; Henry Paulson, the former treasury secretary under President George W. Bush; and Rob Walton, the former head of Wal-Mart. They’re trying to pitch the plan to the White House — and the public. This could be a historic moment. Here are four things you should know about the proposal: 1. Most families would make money off the tax Carbon taxes have long been regarded as a “holy grail” by many climate policy experts. By putting a price on carbon pollution, you encourage people and businesses to switch to cleaner alternatives. The Climate Leadership Council proposes an escalating $40 per ton tax on each ton of carbon dioxide pollution — one of the key pollutants that’s warming the planet. The tax would increase the cost of any activity that burns fossil fuels and therefore pollutes the atmosphere and contributes to dangerous climate change. The average cost of a gallon of gas, for example, would be expected to go up 36-cents, Halstead told me. That might sound like a bad deal for consumers. But the group suggests giving proceeds from the tax back to the public. A four-person family would receive a $2,000 carbon dividend during the first year of the tax, Halstead said. That might come in the form of a check or a direct deposit into a bank account or retirement account. While families might pay more up front for fossil fuel energy, many of them would break even or make money from the carbon dividend payments. Most Americans — the bottom 70% of earners — actually would profit from the tax, he said. Meanwhile, clean activities like buying power from solar panels or wind turbines, or driving an electric car, say, would save consumers money, since nonpolluting activities wouldn’t be taxed. Over time, those cleaner sources of energy would become more popular. “Economists are nearly unanimous in their belief that a carbon tax is the most efficient and effective way to reduce carbon emissions,” the Climate Leadership Council report says. “A sensible carbon tax might begin at $40 a ton and increase steadily over time, sending a powerful signal to businesses and consumers, while generating revenue to reward Americans for decreasing their collective carbon footprint.” The tax would be applied to each ton of CO2 at the source of pollution — for example, at a refinery, mine or port. “This is as good as it gets,” Gernot Wagner, a research associate at Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and co-author of “Climate Shock,” said of the proposal. Steve Valk, spokesman for the Citizens’ Climate Lobby, a grassroots organization that advocates for putting a price on carbon pollution, called the proposal “an aggressive, properly designed carbon tax that employs the power of the free market to do the work is more effective and efficient than regulations.” 2. Backers see it as politically feasible — and popular with voters This is a strange political moment to be proposing any climate change policies. President Donald Trump erroneously has called climate change a hoax (it’s real and we’re causing it primarily by burning fossil fuels), and his “America First Energy Plan” aims to revitalize industries that contribute to dangerous warming. But Halstead told me it’s becoming clear to him that the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress need plans of their own. It’s not good enough just to repeal Obamacare, the thinking goes. You have to replace it, too. Similarly, climate regulations need to be replaced with something, he said. “This is the only way I see for Republicans to have a viable and popular way to cut regulations significantly, because otherwise there will be popular backlash,” Halstead said. “These regulations are there for a reason.” The polls are with him on this. Recent data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication shows nearly 80% of Americans — and more than 60% of Trump voters — support taxing and/or regulating carbon pollution. 3. The tax could help curb US climate pollution The Climate Leadership Council proposes repealing Obama-era climate regulations alongside passing a carbon tax. Some environmentalists certainly would take issue with removing at least some of those regulations, seeing them as compatible with the tax. But an analysis commissioned by the Climate Leadership Council says its plan would be nearly twice as effective as all Obama-era climate regulations at reducing global warming pollution. And nearly three times as effective as repealing the regulations and doing nothing else. This matters because the Earth’s atmosphere isn’t waiting for politics to catch up. Humans already have pumped dangerous quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, enough to warm the planet about 1 degree Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels. The Paris Agreement on climate change sets the international target of limiting warming to 1.5 or at most 2 degrees Celsius. The world is not far — perhaps only a number of years — from ensuring the planet moves into those danger zones. “A price signal is essential and it definitely will do the things the white paper says in terms of unleashing investment in cleaner energy and reducing dependence on foreign oil,” said Vicki Arroyo, executive director of the Georgetown Climate Center. “That all is really critical.” Some climate policy experts would rather see the dividends from the tax be spent on infrastructure projects that go further toward reducing emissions. And the idea of repealing some climate regulations — like energy efficiency standards, which help families save money — makes little sense to Arroyo. 4. Unclear if Congress, White House will go for it Of course, none of these details matter if neither the White House nor Congress takes up the idea. The GOP old-timers pushing the carbon tax aren’t in the administration — or in Congress. Halstead told me the group met with White House officials and were received warmly. But it’s hard to imagine a climate change denier like Trump championing climate legislation. “My crystal ball broke back in November and it keeps breaking every week now in terms of what might happen next,” Arroyo told me. “But I would be quite surprised” if the Trump administration ran with this policy proposal, she said. Still, this is a critical moment in climate change policy. Trump is threatening to send the US back into the fossil fuel era — and that’s happening at exactly the moment China and others are making massive investments in renewable energy. World leaders are trying to figure out how to meet the targets they set as part of the Paris Agreement on climate change — and whether that agreement will continue to exist in the modern political climate. “This kind of conservation is really essential at this particular moment,” Arroyo said. “This is the major challenge of our time — and at least they’re putting forth a proposal.” Trump goes after Dem in wake of Gorsuch comments Diplomats in state of confusion over US transition Related Posts Top Clinton aide got limited immunity in probe Trump on primary opponents who don’t back him: ‘I don’t know how they live with themselves’ Senate Dems block bill to defund Planned Parenthood Fox News national poll: Clinton leads Trump by 7 Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

On Feb. 1, a man approached a driver at a WalMart gas station asking if he could help him find a Walgreens or a hotel. The suspect identified himself as Abul, and said he is from South Africa. The victim told Abul he could drive him to the Walgreens. Once they arrived, the victim asked another man if he knew about the hotel Abul was looking for. The second suspect then got in the backseat of the car and said his name is Joe. Abul told Joe that he has a lot of cash that he needs to do something with. Joe grabbed the money and went into the Walgreens returning to say they needed a safety deposit box. The victim told the men he has a safety deposit box at the bank. All three of the men then drove to the bank where Abul asked the victim to retrieve something from the deposit box and bring it back. Abul told the victim this would prove if he could trust him. According to police, the victim returned to the car with rare coins and cash. Abul then asked the victim to drive them back to the Walgreens and park the car in the back. After they parked, Joe told the victim if he trusted him he would let Joe take the coins and cash to the front of the building. The victim agreed handing over the items from his safety deposit box. A short time later Abul told the victim he was going to check on Joe. Neither of the suspects ever returned to the car. Police are asking anyone with information to call Detective Ruben Vasque at (512)930-6114. Below is security video of the suspects.

Insisting that “on-again-off-again regulation is a poor way to protect the environment,” eight veterans of previous Republican administrations met with White House officials on Tuesday to float the idea of a revenue-neutral carbon tax. In an op-ed in the New York Times, three of the five Republican elder statesmen said a $40-a-ton carbon tax would “send a powerful signal to businesses and consumers to reduce their carbon footprints.” The authors include James Baker, Secretary of the Treasury under Ronald Reagan and Secretary of State under George H.W. Bush; George Schultz, a senior economist during Dwight Eisenhower’s administration, Secretary of the Treasury under Richard Nixon and Secretary of State under Reagan (and a huge proponent of solar power and electric cars); Henry Paulson, a former Goldman Sachs CEO and Secretary of Treasury under George W. Bush; N. Gregory Mankiw, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under the younger Bush; and Martin Feldstein, who chaired the same council during the Reagan administration. Their report, The Conservative Case for Carbon Dividends, also included as co-authors Rob Walton, chairman of Walmart’s board of directors for over 20 years and now chairman of Conservation International’s executive council; Thomas Stephenson, an ambassador during the George W. Bush administration and a partner at Sequoia Capital; and Ted Halstead, CEO of the the Climate Leadership Council, the organization that supported and funded the survey. The problem, say these GOP leaders, is that the Barack Obama administration was unable to push any significant environmental legislation through Congress, so the president enacted policy via executive orders. The outcome, they say, is that the previous administration left a “grab bag” of regulations that may have some effectiveness in curbing carbon emissions, but infuriated Republicans – who are now, of course, hell-bent on overturning them. They insist the result is uncertainty not only for businesses, but also for the environmental community, which will witness Obama-era programs and regulations disappear quickly. The solution, according to messengers Baker, Schultz, et al., is a revenue-neutral carbon tax that would push businesses to reduce their carbon footprint, put money in Americans’ pockets and account for imports from countries that do not have a carbon tax in order to maintain U.S. companies’ competitiveness. In exchange for this carbon tax, however, would be the rollback of regulations enacted during the Obama administration, including the Clean Power Plan. This carbon tax proposal has four pillars: 1. An increasing carbon tax The authors suggest that the carbon tax start at a “sensible” $40 a ton, which would be imposed at the first point where fossil fuels enter the economy — as in mines, refineries and ports. This tax would increase over time — which would not only send a relentless signal to companies that they need to change their business practices, but would also nudge Americans to change their everyday habits. And the higher the tax becomes, the more American citizens would benefit. This pillar speaks to the environmental community, who in theory would see their goals achieved as more companies ditch fossil fuels in favor of renewable sources of power such as wind and solar. 2. Redistribution of these funds to all citizens through ‘climate dividends’ All of the carbon tax’s proceeds would be paid back to Americans equally on a quarterly basis via checks, direct deposits or into individual retirement accounts. Under a $40 per ton tax, a family of four would receive about $2,000 annually. That $500 per quarter would become higher as the carbon tax increases — motivating more Americans to move toward a low-carbon lifestyle, as more climate protection means higher checks. The authors suggest that the Social Security Administration run the program, as dividend payments would be tied to social security numbers. This redistribution policy would undoubtedly appeal to the Bernie Sanders progressives who feel that too many in the working and middle classes are being left behind. 3. Border carbon adjustments This pillar appeals to citizens who believe the U.S. has become a patsy on international trade – and helped to fuel Donald Trump’s narrow win in the November election. Businesses that export to companies lacking a similar carbon tax system would receive rebates for any taxes paid, while imports from those same nations would be subjected to a surcharge based on the carbon content of their goods. The more imports from countries lacking any carbon pricing structures, the more dividends would be paid to Americans. But the report’s authors claim such a policy could actually inspire more countries to adopt a similar carbon tax policy, which would result in a bigger win for the global environment. 4. A rollback in regulations This is where the details of the plan become complicated. The report’s theory is that a higher carbon tax would negate any need for Obama-era energy and environmental regulations. The Clean Power Plan would disappear, and the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority over carbon emissions would eventually be eliminated. But in order to broaden the appeal of this carbon tax proposal, the authors suggest aiming high and setting emission reductions that are even more ambitious than what current regulations dictate. Is it feasible? The policy appears simple, but naturally there is the stubborn fact called reality. Environmental organizations will fight any rollback of the Obama administration-era rules. In an emailed statement to TriplePundit, Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), wrote: “Putting a price on carbon could be an important part of a comprehensive program. It can’t do the job alone, though, and is not a replacement for carbon limits under our current laws.” Many Republicans have also expressed hostility to any suggestion of a new tax, dating back to the “Contract for America” surge that allowed Republicans to sweep into control of Congress in 1994 after Democrats dominated both chambers for 40 years. Trump’s Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, has indicated that he favors a carbon tax. But critics say his statements are more lip service than advocacy for such a policy. Furthermore, Trump has made it clear that he is less interested in climate policy than he is in favor of harvesting America’s fossil fuel reserves. Nevertheless, the Trump administration has an opportunity to extend a hand to some of his most strident opponents. His presidency’s first few weeks have been largely lampooned for arguments over inauguration crowds and whining over Nordstrom’s. And of course there has been the huge distraction of Trump’s immigration executive order, while opponents continue to speak out against other executive orders and his cabinet picks. Embracing such a policy would show critics of all political persuasions the the president is serious about policy. Republicans would warm up to the elimination of regulations, struggling families would happily pocket the money, and environmental groups would see a reduction in emissions and pollution. But this carbon tax plan means everyone would have to give up something sacrosanct and compromise, a word that is no longer in the vocabulary of many of our nation’s leaders.

It is just one of the latest schemes for federal government to extract more revenues from its people and businesses. Good people of common sense have great hopes that Donald Trump will put the genie back into the bottle and drastically reduce the size and scope of the federal government.

Home Industry Quality, supply chain verified by Cotton Egypt Association: Welspun Quality, supply chain verified by Cotton Egypt Association: Welspun Home linen major Welspun India Ltd (WIL) today said Cotton Egypt Association (CEA) has verified its quality and supply chain reliability processes while also announcing a pact to promote and market the African country's cotton products worldwide. By: PTI | New Delhi | Published: February 9, 2017 5:23 PM Welspun had undertaken stringent audit and traceability programme to ensure the best product quality that is certifiable, verifiable and auditable, it added. (Reuters) Home linen major Welspun India Ltd (WIL) today said Cotton Egypt Association (CEA) has verified its quality and supply chain reliability processes while also announcing a pact to promote and market the African country’s cotton products worldwide. The agreement comes nearly six months after Welspun India was dropped by major US retailers, including Target and Walmart, for substituting Egyptian cotton with another type of non-Egyptian cotton to make bedsheets and pillowcases sold in the stores of the retailers. “The Cotton Egypt Association, post verifying Welspun’s quality and supply chain reliability processes, has granted the company the right to use the Egyptian Cotton logo for five years until 2022,” the company said in a BSE filing. Welspun had undertaken stringent audit and traceability programme to ensure the best product quality that is certifiable, verifiable and auditable, it added. As part of their agreement, Welspun India will invest $3 million in a stage wise manner over next few years to support joint initiatives, it added. “The two organisations will work together to create programmes for promotion of Egyptian Cotton logo in the retail markets across the globe,” the company said. The agreement will also help enhance the complete supply chain of the Egyptian cotton starting from cultivation to the final product, which will also benefit the Egyptian farmer and the industry as a whole, it said.

CEA is established by the Egyptian Ministry of Industry and Foreign Trade and Alexandria Cotton Exporters Association and it is mandated to manage, promote and protect the Egyptian Cotton and the Egyptian Cotton Logo worldwide. Last year, several foreign retailer as Target, Walmart, Bed Bath & Beyond and JCPenny has stopped sourcing Welspun India’s Egyptian cotton products following lapses in supplies by the Gujarat-based firm. This had started after Target Corporation after an extensive investigation had confirmed that Welspun substituted another type of on-Egyptian cotton when producing Bed sheets and pillows between August 2014 and July 2016.

The gross, sticky, goopy mess is a hit again with kids Feb 8 More from Tom Avril Arrow icon Drugstores are struggling to keep glue – yes, ordinary white schoolhouse glue – on the shelves. Parents are keeping a wary eye on the upholstery. And children are selling bags of an odd, glue-based concoction recently banned by at least one elementary school in Kansas. Slideshow Slime is back! The gross, sticky, goopy mess is a hit again with kids Advertisment of Gallery: Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon This can only mean one thing. Slime is back. It goes by several names, and the recipes vary, but the main ingredients are glue, water, and borax. The result is a gloriously gloppy mess, customizable with glitter, food coloring, and other add-ins. Alicia Hebert's first clue came a few months ago, when she wanted to do the laundry in her Chadds Ford home but could not find the detergent. Her daughter Hana, 10, turned out to be the culprit – as detergent contains borax, also known as sodium borate. "I go into her room, and there's this slime everywhere," Hebert said. "I had to put a stop to that." She now allows slime in uncarpeted areas of the house -- but Hana needed more glue. The family struck out at Target, Walmart, and Michaels, then finally ordered some online, Hebert said. They have plenty of company. The makers of Elmer's Glue report a slime-related increase in sales in the second half of 2016, with a particular spike in December, when retail sales of liquid glue more than doubled, compared to the same month a year earlier. Hoboken, N.J.-based Newell Brands has stepped up production to meet the demand, and has been impressed by the evidence of creativity on social media sites, spokeswoman Caitlin Watkins said. "We’ve seen a variety of slime recipes oozing through cyberspace over the past few weeks," she said. The company posted its own version a few days ago, calling it "glitter gak." On Instagram, there are 1.7 million posts with the hashtag #slime. And for the 12 weeks ending Jan. 22, unit sales of glue were up 15 percent at major retailers compared to the same period a year earlier, according to IRI, a Chicago-based market research firm. But why? A lingering effect of the 2016 Ghostbusters reboot? A yearning for simpler times? The resurgent craze has prompted amusement among educators who have been making it for years. Pattie DiTomaso, who conducts science demonstrations at the Franklin Institute, said the enduring appeal lies in its simplicity. "In this digital age, it's basic stuff," she said. "It's good chemistry." Under another name, the science museum also has used the substance for a lesson on the immune system, said Mickey Maley, assistant director of public programs. A few years back, someone made a big model of a nose to simulate how it filters pollen and other allergens, complete with black pipe-cleaners to represent nose hairs. Particles of pollen were represented by confetti, blown through the "nose" by a leaf-blower. Initially, most of the confetti blew right through. But when slime was added – dubbed "mucus" for this purpose – the nose blocked confetti much better, Maley said. "The mucus was pouring out of the nose," he said. "Great visual." Slime also is a great way to teach chemistry, said Mickey Sarquis, a professor emerita of chemistry at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. The basic principle is simple, she said. Glue is basically a mixture of water and polyvinyl acetate, a type of polymer. These long, stringy molecular chains slip and slide past each other like cooked spaghetti in a pot of water, she said. But when you add borax, it forms chemical bonds between the "spaghetti" much like the rungs on a ladder, she said. The polymer strands can no longer slip and slide, and the result is gooey and stretchy. (Technical term: a cross-linked polymer.) Sarquis taught teachers how to use slime as a classroom tool, though back in the 1980s she called it "gluep,"  and published several related papers in the Journal of Chemical Education. Pro tip: when mixing borax powder in water, do it in a ventilated area, she said. (see recipe at end) For Sarquis, the term slime meant a different substance, in which the glue was replaced by polyvinyl alcohol. Not to be confused with Slime, the commercial product made by Mattel in the 1970s, which contained a substance called guar gum. Sarquis devised classroom demonstrations in which students joined hands to mimic the long chains of polymers. Once, she did a slime workshop with Amish students in Indiana, and posed a question that she immediately regretted. "You don't ask a bunch of farm kids what it reminds you of, because you'll get answers you don't want to hear," she said. Others riding the slime train include a blogger at babycenter.com, who wrote that her child's Kansas elementary school had banned slime because it was a distraction, and Good Housekeeping, which chimed in this week with its own recipe. Though to us, it seems a bit like bad housekeeping. Getting the stuff out of your carpet is murder. Not to worry, said Miami's Sarquis. If you catch it before it dries, slime can be removed with a few dabs of vinegar – an acid that dissolves the cross-linked chemical bonds. Linda Vertlieb, who blogs at www.frugalphillymom.com, likes the activity for her children, Sophia, 9, and Alex, 4, because of the inexpensive ingredients, and advises stocking up on glue during back-to-school sales. The low cost helps for those slime-makers who are capitalists as well as chemists, said Hebert, the Chadds Ford mom. Her daughter's friends have been selling it to each other for $1 per container. But not Hana. "She thought that wasn't fair," Hebert said, "so she gives it away." How to make your own slime Measure 1 tablespoon of glue (such as Elmer's) into a cup.

Workers’ strikes may be effective in some countries. But in America striking is a tool of the distant past. Workers syndicates, with the possible exception of police unions, are hardly extant in the 21st century. Boycott is an option, but generally not a very effective political instrument where people are too attached to their pleasures and habits, whether sugary drinks, big cars, online shopping, dining or holidaying. (I admit that I myself am facing difficulty—thus far I’m managing—sustaining my boycott of SNL because of Katie Rich’s nasty remark about Trump’s young son.) But we’re in a new era, aren’t we? A new ball game, where the immediate target of boycott would be very precise, a mortal, and a businessman. A perfect prey. No need to appeal to ethics or justice, when the strategy is to vote with one’s wallet against Trump family enterprises. No court decisions are needed, no mass signatures, no parades at the gates of Trump properties. Consumers can simply stop buying, and there’s plenty to strike off the shopping list, starting with Ivanka Trump’s fashion and jewelry products—carried in upscale stores like Nieman Marcus and Saks and by peoples’ retailers Walmarts and Amazon. (A boycott that overrides class distinctions). From reports of markdowns in store this week, the action, initiated by #grabyourwallet seems well underway. But wait. Ivanka’s shoe line is the glamorous surface of this movement. Forget about quarterback Brady’s friendship with Trump, and discover an underworld of millions of possible boycotters. I’m talking about academics—an almost invisible and, dare I say, politically conservative American (liberal) population. Our scientists and academics, if they are mad enough and can summon their courage to boycott, could make a tremendous impact. Unexpectedly, tens of thousands have already signed on to what’s become a tsunami wave to challenge Trump’s Muslim ban. University staff, hospital administrators, researchers and professors in all fields of scholarship and science are publicly acknowledging the millions of women and men in their labs, their lecture halls, their conferences and panels, and their classrooms who are recent or settled immigrants, visiting students, invited professors, co-authors—all foreign born, many of them Muslim– on special visas or with green cards. In response to President Trumps travel ban, two major academic  boycotts are underway: a Canadian boycott with over 4000 signatories, arose on the heels of another initiated in the UK with over 42,000 supporters. All are refusing to attend any professional conferences in the USA. To start. Academic conferences? you inquire smugly. We need millions of plebeians in the streets to make any impact, you claim. I give street protests their due; they’re essential in demonstrating the reach and depth of public resistance. But don’t sniff at conferences. Hotels thrive on them, yes. But so do our professors, graduate students, the entire research community, and the economy. Academic conferences are where new graduates seek employment, where scholars present research findings and authors hunt for publishers, where accolades are awarded and new leaders are identified, where alumni meet and reaffirm their college’s reputation, where professional networks are strengthened and expanded. These conferences are huge events. Take my field of anthropology for example. As a U. K. graduate we had a community of barely 300 anthropologists in the 1980s. So I was overwhelmed on my initial visit to the U.S., attending the annual AAA (American Anthropological Association) conference, to find myself among 3,300 fellow researchers. (Today that figure is double.) Besides nation-wide conferences, each profession has regional gatherings and state forums. Multiply this by all the professions, from neurology to modern Chinese literature, paleontology to copyright law, and you begin to grasp the scale of this low-keyed professional world. Conferences are essential to academic growth, to career advancement, to intellectual competition and exchange, events eagerly anticipated year after year. Yet tens of thousands are ready to forego them in support of their ‘foreign’ colleagues. This is serious. These scientists know how essential ‘foreigners’ are to their own successes, to rigorous intellectual dialogue, and to America’s global cultural and scientific influence. Those foreign students joining research teams win accolades and grants for their departments, many staying on permanently. Visiting professors are welcomed, feted, and often offered permanent jobs in the U.S. The high quality education and love of learning that Indians, Iraqis, Iranians, Pakistanis, Palestinians, Sudanese, and Syrians bring from their homelands are coveted by U.S. research laboratories, colleges and institutes. Perusing the 2013 American National Science Foundation survey we can measure the prominence of immigrants. For example, between 2003 and 2013, of 341,000 immigrant scientists and engineers, more than half, 1,873,000, originated in Asia—Far East, Southeast and South Asia, and ‘other’– likely West Asia/Middle East. (Compare with 632,000 from Europe, and 179,000 from South America.) Of 21,000,000 scientists and engineers, 15.6 percent are non-native born. Over 80 percent of immigrant scholars enter computer and math sciences, increasingly important fields in our economy. Engaging in an academic boycott is a real social, political and economic sacrifice. It’s neither common nor easy, as attested in the long, uphill of the academic boycott of Israel. Older professors recall their successful boycott of South Africa (1965-1990),  part of the global Anti-Apartheid movement, 50 years ago with nostalgia, partly because of its exceptionality. So today’s boycott against Trump’s policies represents a historical breakthrough. The lists are growing daily, the most recent being the boycott by an American NGO, a Minnesota nonprofit serving Somali-American youth. Over barely two weeks, public boycotts are matching a fortnight of presidential decrees. Join the debate on Facebook Barbara Nimri Aziz is a New York based anthropologist and journalist.

As previously announced, all our indictors have increased: revenue, operating margin (amount and percentage of revenue), headline diluted EPS and dividend payout. On top of these positive elements, it worth mentioning the very high level of free cash flow generation and debt reduction. These results have been achieved against the backdrop of a modest organic growth rate, mainly due to lower US revenue as a result of media accounts lost in 2015 and the first half of 2016, but also to serious issues at Razorfish. This led us to merge Razorfish and SapientNitro in order to create the worlds first entity dedicated to consumer experience, and to book an impairment charge in our 2016 accounts. After this impairment, the balance sheet now shows very solid indicators with a debt / equity ratio of 0.21 and liquidity of close to five billion euro, considerably enhancing our agility. 2016 was devoted to the implementation of Publicis Groupes new organization and transformation from an "advertising holding company to a "connecting company with the creation of a completely new approach called "The Power of One. The results of this have been excellent since they were first felt in the summer of 2016, with remarkable client successes such as Asda in the UK, Wal-Mart in the USA, account wins including Merck, KFC and, more recently, HSBC, but also the return of Special K and the retention of Mars with a budget extension and the recent retention of GMC after a lengthy review. This new approach is still in the very early stages but, given the results already achieved, strikes me as very promising. 2017 clearly marks the beginning of a new era, as much for the market as for our Groupe. Society is evolving spectacularly as the exponential development of digital and other technologies obliges companies to undergo very deep transformation. Outcomes of referendums in the UK and Italy and elections in the US have rung in geopolitical upheavals bringing with them new uncertainties for Europe whereas Americas traditional positions seem to produce economic consequences that are difficult to gauge. Our Groupe is ready for this new world thanks to its high-potential digital assets and capacities to help our clients embrace this new order, including help with their own transformation. And we have a new generation at the helm. After 30 years devoted to developing the superb brand that is Publicis and making the Groupe a global player, I will be passing over the chairmanship of the Management Board to Arthur Sadoun on June 1. Arthur has demonstrated the very broad range of his abilities over the last ten years, he is a great professional driven by his passionate approach to clients and his desire to make them winners. He understands the world of tomorrow, knows how to attract talent and bring people together to work in multidisciplinary teams, which is the only way to get the best out of The Power of One which has already proved such a success. As for myself, subject to approval from the shareholders, I will succeed Elisabeth Badinter as Chair of the Supervisory Board and will have the immense pleasure of having her continued vigilant presence on the Board. At this point, I would like to express heartfelt thanks to the people who, through their input over the last three decades, have made Publicis what it is, namely the worlds third-ranked global communications group, first in digital, with operations in over 100 countries. Over the last 30 years, Publicis has multiplied its revenue by 50, its staff by 25 and its market cap by 100. We are and will continue to be ambitious. I know that our successors are ready to step in, and they are energetic, curious, committed, creative and very determined. This new team will build Publicis Groupes future by achieving the ultimate goal of our transformation with The Power of One. To defy the challenges of the future, Arthur Sadoun can count on the top-flight expertise of Management Board members Jean-Michel Etienne and Anne-Gabrielle Heilbronner, enriched by the arrival of Steve King whose stellar career to date commands admiration. To achieve our future objectives we must improve our organic growth. The first half of 2017 will still bear the marks of previous difficulties, but as of the second half year, the Groupe should be back to levels of growth which are more comparable to its peers. And beyond, growth should be sustainably back on track with performances that are more consistent with our profile and history. Our recent commercial successes, which we should leverage to improve our margins and continue to generate substantial cash flow, give me confidence about our future. This is why we are planning to propose to the Shareholders AGM to approve a 16% increase of our dividend to 1.85 euro, and we are confirming our objectives for 2018. Publicis Groupes Supervisory Board met on February 8, 2017, under the chairmanship of Elisabeth Badinter, to examine the annual accounts for 2016 presented by Maurice Lévy, Chairman of the Management Board and Chief Executive Officer. 1 - KEY FIGURES EUR million, excepting percentages and per share data (in euro)   2016   2015   2016 vs. 2015 Revenue   9,733   9,601   +1.4% Operating margin before Depreciation & Amortization 1,682 1,661 % of revenue 17.3% 17.3% Operating margin 1,516 1,487 +2.0% % of revenue 15.6% 15.5% Operating income 9 1,378 Net income attributable to the Groupe (527) 901 Headline EPS, diluted (1)   4.46   4.39   +1.6% Free Cash Flow before changes in working capital requirements   1,261   1,097   +14.9% (1) After elimination of impairment charges, amortization of intangibles arising from acquisitions, main capital gains (losses) on disposals and revaluation of earn-out payments 2 - BUSINESS ACTIVITY IN 2016 Publicis Groupes business environment was one of global growth comparable to that of 2015, but characterized nonetheless by recovery in the emerging markets and continued sluggish performance in the American and European economies. Inflation remained low. Organic growth was weak, as expected, at +0.7% due to accounts lost in 2015 and early 2016 and to issues at Razorfish. Given this context, the Groupe has taken the required decisions to re-launch growth, fully benefit from Razorfishs assets, and keep costs under strict control. Therefore, operating margin rate improved slightly and Free Cash Flow rose by 14.9% to 1.261 billion euro. 2.1 - Q4 2016 revenue Publicis Groupes consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was 2,665 million euro, down 2.5% from 2,734 million in Q4 2015. Exchange rates impacted revenue negatively by 27 million euro, i.e. 1.0% of revenue in Q4 2015. Net acquisitions contributed 25 million euro to revenue in Q4 2016, i.e. the equivalent of 0.9% of Q4 2015 revenue. Growth at constant exchange rates was -1.6%. Organic growth was -2.5% in the fourth quarter. It was negative due to media accounts lost in 2015 and early 2016, the fact that certain digital projects reached completion at Razorfish before others had fully ramped up, and a very unfavorable basis on comparison in North America in Q4 2015 (+6.3%) where the market was not as strong as anticipated. Breakdown of Q4 2016 revenue by region EUR   Revenue   Organic   Reported million   Q4 2016   Q4 2015   growth   growth Europe 768   770 +5.1% -0.3% North America 1,362 1,417 -6.9% -3.9% Asia Pacific 321 320 -1.5% +0.3% Latin America 124 134 -1.1% -7.5% Middle East & Africa   90   93   +1.3%   -3.2% Total   2,665   2,734   -2.5%   -2.5% 2.2 - 2016 Revenue In 2016, Publicis Groupes consolidated revenue rose to 9,733 million euro, an increase of 1.4% from 9,601 million in 2015. Exchange rates adversely affected revenue by 177 million euro, i.e. 1.8% of 2015 revenue. Net acquisitions contributed 247 million euro to revenue in 2016, i.e. the equivalent of 2.6% of 2015 revenue. Growth at constant exchange rates was +3.3%. Organic growth was 0.7% in 2016. Breakdown of 2016 revenue by region EUR   Revenue   Organic   Reported million   2016   2015   growth   growth Europe 2,760   2,664 +5.9% +3.6% North America 5,236 5,184 -2.2% +1.0% Asia Pacific 1,085 1,066 +1.5% +1.8% Latin America 365 412 +2.9% -11.4% Middle East & Africa   287   275   +1.1%   +4.4% Total   9,733   9,601   +0.7%   +1.4% Europe posted 3.6% revenue growth. When the impact of acquisitions and exchange rates is factored out, organic growth was +5.9%. France performed well (+6.5%), and Germany and Italy both posted strong momentum (+8.0% and 6.3% respectively), all shored up by the improving macroeconomic situation. The situation was volatile in Russia where growth for the full year was +11.8%. The UK showed a marked improvement at +5.9% (including organic growth in excess of 8% in the second half of the year, following on close to 4% in the first half). Overall, digital progressed sharply in Europe, achieving growth of 11.1%. North America reported growth of 1.0% but organic growth of -2.2% due notably to a decline in the fourth quarter (-6.9% on an organic basis). This downturn is attributed to the loss of accounts, particularly during the Mediapalooza, but also to the completion of certain digital projects at a time when more recent projects have yet to ramp up to cruising speed. In addition, organic growth was high in Q4 2015 (+6.3%) which served as the basis of comparison for Q4 2016, where the market was not as strong as anticipated. Asia Pacific achieved reported growth of 1.8% and organic growth of 1.5%. China decreased in the second half year (-6.0%) as a result of difficulties encountered by Genedigi, after achieving +4.4% in the first half year. India and Singapore posted full year growth of 0.5% and 8.1% respectively. Latin America was down 11.4% on a reported basis, mainly because of exchange rates, whilst organic growth was +2.9% for the period. Brazil saw its revenue fall by 1.9% in 2016 despite Rio hosting the Olympic Games. This represents an outperformance in a declining market overall. Mexico continued to post strong growth (+7.7% in 2016). The Middle East & Africa region achieved reported growth of 4.4% and organic growth of 1.1%. 2016 organic growth by region: digital and analog     Europe   North America   Asia Pacific   Latin America   Middle East & Africa   Total Digital   +11.1%   -0.4%   +9.5%   -1.4%   +11.2%   +3.2% Analog   +1.5%   -5.3%   -2.8%   +4.0%   -1.5%   -2.0% Total   +5.9%   -2.2%   +1.5%   +2.9%   +1.1%   +0.7% The Groupes growth continued to be driven by its digital activities (organic growth of +3.2%). North America saw its digital growth decline by 0.4% due to the impact of media accounts lost and the completion of certain digital projects at Razorfish at a time when new projects are only slowly gathering speed. Razorfish posted negative growth in double digits. It should also be mentioned that analog activities continued to decline. 3 - ANALYSIS OF THE KEY FIGURES 3.1 - Income statement Operating margin before depreciation and amortization reached 1,682 million euro in 2016, up 1.3% from 1,661 million in 2015, i.e. a percentage margin of 17.3% of revenue (stable versus 2015): - Personnel costs totaled 6,059 million euro at December 31, 2016, up 1.2% from 5,988 million in 2015. Fixed personnel costs amounted to 5,268 million, i.e. 54.1% of total revenue (unchanged versus 2015). Freelance costs reached 444 million euro in 2016, after 414 million in 2015. Restructuring costs stood at 73 million euro in 2016 as the Groupe implements its reorganization and adjusts to an environment that is increasingly digital-oriented, while continuing to generate synergies from the Sapient acquisition. Operational efficiency will be enhanced by the various projects in which the Groupe continues to invest (ERP roll-out, the development of production platforms, on-going regionalization of the Shared Services Centers, as well as a number of technological developments). - Other operating costs (excluding Depreciation & Amortization) totaled 1,992 million euro after 1,952 million in 2015. These costs represented 20.5% of consolidated revenue (versus 20.3% in 2015). Depreciation for the period was 166 million euro, i.e. a 4.6% decrease on 2015. Operating margin rose to 1,516 million euro, i.e. a 2% increase over 1,487 million in 2015. As a percentage of revenue, the margin stood at 15.6%, compared with 15.5% in 2015. As a percentage of revenue, operating margin was impacted by 20 basis points as a result of acquisitions and currencies impact versus the euro. At constant perimeter and currencies, operating margin as a percentage of revenue improved by 30 basis points due to the positive impact in 2016 of cost reduction measures implemented since end 2015 including Sapient cost synergies, lower restructuring charges, partly offset by higher costs related to the ERP deployment and other IT initiatives. The operating margin by region was 15.5% in Europe, 15.5% in North America, 15.9% in Asia Pacific, 14.0% in Latin America and 17.4% for the Middle East & Africa region. Amortization of intangibles arising from acquisitions totaled 79 million euro in 2016, down from 89 million in 2015. The Publicis.Sapients assets, which goodwill and intangible assets amount to 4.9 billion euro, have been analyzed thoroughly given the underperformance of some of its entities. The solution hub has been confronted to delays in the integration of acquisitions, in particular Razorfish. A new management team has been put in place and required investments in consulting teams have been revalued. New forecasts now factor in a faster-than-expected growth in the business transformation activity but a slower-than-anticipated growth for the remaining digital activities, which in total, will impact estimated growth of the coming years. In order to take those new market conditions into account, which impact both the value of some of Publicis.Sapients assets and future cash flows of the solution hub, the Groupe booked a non-cash depreciation charge of 1,440 million euro (including 1,392 million for Publicis.Sapient), after an impairment of 28 million in 2015. Other non-recurring income (expenses) amounted to income of 12 million euro, corresponding mainly to the capital gain on the disposal of Mediavision, after income of 8 million euro in 2015. Operating income totaled 9 million euro in 2016, versus 1,378 million in 2015. Financial income (expense), excluding earn-out revaluation, amounted to a net expense of 74 million euro in 2016, after an expense of 77 million euro in 2015. The cost of net financial debt is stable - 74 million euro in 2016 as in 2015  and the other components of the financial income (expense), mainly foreign exchange gains and losses as well as expenses relating to the discounting of long-term provisions, are slightly improving, from 3 million euro expense in 2015 to 0 in 2016. Revaluation of earn-out costs totaled 108 million euro in 2016, up from 12 million in 2015. This includes revaluations concerning Genedigi (end of earn-out), Heartbeat, Turner Duckworth, 3 Share as well as a certain number of more recently acquired subsidiaries whose expected performance has been revised upwards.

The Supervisory Board has proposed that, upon completion of his term of office, Maurice Lévy join its ranks and take over as Chairman. This motion will be put to a vote before the shareholders at their AGM on May 31, 2017. 6 - OUTLOOK The implementation of "One company and the transformation from a "holding to a "connecting company are taking place according to the announced plan, with an excellent feedback from clients to the "Power of One proposal. Recent successes in client retention (GMC, Mars, Special K) as well as client and budget wins (HPE, USAA, HSBC) are promising signs that Publicis Groupes growth will resume. The first half of 2017 will be impacted by some account losses and the difficulties at Razorfish, but they will progressively be offset by the ramp up of account wins. The 2018 plan should be delivered as expected. The economic and business environment for our clients on one hand, and the "One company and transformation concepts on the other hand, should be favorable to Publicis Groupe. * * * Disclaimer Certain information contained in this document, other than historical information, may constitute forward-looking statements or unaudited financial forecasts.

Yet with a little time and some effort you can drive the costs down while still churning out page after page of Mapquest directions or FedEx shipping labels. 1) Get familiar with your printer's settings Image: Screenshot If you've never delved into the settings dialog box for your printer, now's the time to do so, via Devices in Settings in Windows or Printers & Scanners in System Preferences on macOS. There are various ways you can tweak the output to save on ink and cut down your costs, and if you're doing a lot of printing then the savings can quickly add up. The exact options available will vary depending on your printer but the basic ones can be found on all models: the option to print in draft (or super draft) mode, which cuts down on the amount of ink used and can sometimes make things look faded, and the option to print in black and white only, which will avoid using pricey color inks all together. Both will save you money in the long run. Your choice of printer may well come with some more advanced ink-saving options of its own too. 2) Shop around and buy in bulk Image: Screenshot It's usually best to stick with the ink cartridges that are officially approved for your printer-those made by the same manufacturer-as they're the only ones guaranteed to work perfectly with the model you've got, but there's some scope for saving money if you shop around various online outlets rather than buying ink directly from the website (or a big box store like Wal-Mart or Best Buy). Buying in bulk can also save you money in the long run, even if there's a bigger financial hit to absorb to begin with (keep an eye out for special offers). You can use unbranded cartridges and refills too for even bigger savings (especially if quality isn't paramount), but make sure you do your research carefully first, and check reviews from other users. 3) Choosing paper and duplex printing Image: Screenshot Think about who you're printing for: if they're going to be happy enough with lower-quality paper then you can make big savings on the type of paper you buy. Another well-known trick is to switch to duplex printing, which prints two pages on one sheet of paper, if your printer supports it. You're effectively halving the number of pieces of paper you need for each print run. Of course, anything you can do to cut down the number of sheets will help, from reducing the font size in documents to shrinking down several sheets to fit on one page. Not all of these tricks are going to be appropriate for all of your print jobs, but if you put some thought into it you might well be able to save a little bit of ink or paper along the way. 4) Upgrade your printer and share the bills Image: Screenshot These days you can pick up wireless, network-capable printers very cheaply indeed without sacrificing too much on quality along the way. If you've got several older printers knocking around the house then it might be time to consolidate your printing operation and set up one central device that all of your family's computers and phones can link to. It's going to mean some financial outlay in the short term, but you should get that back over time if you're all sharing the cost of inks and paper-remember laser is usually cheaper over time if you're doing a lot of regular printing, otherwise go for inkjet. And if the printer is connected to your network, you can use it from pretty much anywhere . 5) Outsource your printing Image: HP A more radical approach would be to get rid of your printer altogether and rely on printing shops (or maybe friends and neighbors) for your future printing needs. Do you really need to have access to a printer or can you replace your print jobs with other options (like the digital tickets you can generate for everything from flights to gigs on today's mobile apps)? Check with local stores (and friends and neighbors) to see what they'll print for you and what their turnaround times are. And always check the print preview page, even if you're in a rush, before passing your files to the print shop. Sending out botched print jobs is going to end up costing you money, money that can be easily saved if you take the time to double-check your work before printing.

Continue Reading Below Shares in the organic and natural food grocer were down 2.1 percent in extended trading. "We're examining every aspect of our retail operations," Whole Foods co-founder John Mackey, who recently resumed the role of sole chief executive officer after the departure of co-CEO Walter Robb, said on a conference call with analysts. Whole Foods has been battling intense competition from rivals that include Kroger and Wal-Mart Stores, as well as new competitors such as Amazon.com Inc and meal kit provider Blue Apron. The company has been lowering prices and experimenting with its value-oriented 365 by WholeFoods Market chain, as it tries to shed its unflattering "Whole Paycheck" nickname. Mackey said the company is "doubling down" on its most loyal customers, continue to lower prices and taking other steps to improve profitability and efficiency. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT "What has become clear is that we don't want to compete in a 'race to the bottom' as consumers have ever increasing choices for how much and where they shop," Mackey said. Whole Foods has closed one commissary kitchen and will be closing nine stores and the company's last two remaining commissary kitchens in the current quarter. It also terminated two leases. Mackey said the majority of the stores slated for closure were smaller, older acquisitions and that shuttering them should improve results. Whole Foods also is teaming up with dunnhumby, a private, wholly owned consumer data subsidiary of Tesco Plc, in a bid to catch up with Kroger and other rivals that already use such information to improve merchandising and personalize offers to loyal customers. The organic and natural food grocer on Wednesday said same-store sales fell a sharper-than-expected 2.4 percent in the fiscal first quarter ended Jan. 15, the sixth straight quarterly drop. That decline accelerated to 3.2 percent for the current second quarter through Feb. 5. Whole Foods it expects sales for the year to rise 1.5 percent or greater, compared with its previous forecast of growth of 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent. It also cut its profit forecast for the year to $1.33 per share or greater, from its previous view of $1.42 or greater. First-quarter revenue rose 1.9 percent to $4.92 billion from a year earlier. Net income fell to $95 million, or 30 cents per share, from $157 million, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier. The company said it incurred a charge of about 9 cents per share in the quarter, related to Robb's separation agreement and store closures. It expects to incur an additional charge related to the closures of about 6 cents per share in the current quarter.

File Picture: BUSINESS DAY The newly appointed chairman of Edcon said the retailer was too important to fail and would be turned around. Gareth Penny, who took up the position on Wednesday, said he was "confident we can continue to make progress in recreating a world-class retailer". Penny, the former group CEO of De Beers, said Edcon, which is the largest clothing retailer in SA, had 45,000 employees, 9-million registered customers and was a major player in local malls. "It will be got right," said Penny, who during his tenure at De Beers was instrumental in reshaping the world’s largest diamond company. Edcon and watchdog sing from same book The other board members are Bernie Brookes, Rhidwaan Gasant, Daphne Motsepe, Marti Murray, Grant Pattison and Keith Warburton. Brookes, who is CEO, is the only executive of the relatively small board. Former Massmart CEO Pattison is the only nonexecutive with any significant retail experience, although it did not involve much exposure to clothing. Walmart has failed to make inroads in the local clothing market with Makro and Game failing to crack the market. Analysts were generally unimpressed by the list of new directors. "It looks as though Bernie [Brookes] doesn’t want to be challenged," said Sasfin analyst Alec Abraham. But Penny said Pattison and Brookes had good hands-on retail experience and as a former chief financial officer of Clicks, Warburton would provide good financial back-up. He said Motsepe, who is a former Absa executive, and Gasant, who is CEO of Rapid African Energy Holdings, would bring important perspectives to the board. Murray, an American and along with Brookes the only non-South African on the board, "has great experience in dealing with corporate challenges". Penny said former Edcon CEO Steve Ross and former Woolworths top executive Andrew Jennings, who had been touted as candidates for the role of chairman, would play an advisory role to the company. Edcon aims to win hearts and reap rewards in peak season Jennings, who is South African, worked in Australia as a consultant for Brookes in his largely successful efforts to turn around leading Australian group Meyers. The previous Edcon board also had limited retail experience and was dominated by bankers with a sprinkling of miners. As well as diamond retailing, Penny’s experience includes mining and banking. Penny said Brookes had done a good job since he took over in October 2015. "We’ve made progress but there is still a significant period ahead." Please login or register to comment.

The discount supermarket, which along with Lidl upended the UK market as they undercut rivals on pricing, is in the middle of a $3bn-plus US expansion to increase the number of stores by 650 to 2,000 over the five years to the end of 2018. Quotes in the article Whole Foods Market Inc WFM ▼ 30.34 -0.01 -0.03% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 68.02 -1.06 -1.53% Aldi has grown to more than 1,600 stores. The company said the additional $1.6bn would cover the cost of expanding and remodelling 1,300 stores to accommodate its ramped up offerings of fresh produce as well as improving lighting and using recycled materials and energy-saving refrigeration. The move comes as Lidl is entering the US market, constructing distribution centres ahead of plans to open its first store. With groceries already suffering from price deflation, in part due to aggressive pricing by Walmart, Aldi’s new investment underlines the heated competition in the US supermarket industry. The US grocery market has fragmented since the financial crisis, with consumers prepared to pay for quality items but also keeping a sharp eye on their purse strings. And as Walmart and other grocers including Aldi increase their organic offerings, Whole Foods has struggled to maintain comparable store sales. The revamped stores, which will offer a wider range of organic and gluten-free products, will compete directly with Whole Foods’ cheaper 365 brand aimed at the younger demographic. The move comes as US and foreign companies are getting to grips with the new president, who has singled out a string of companies in recent months from Lockheed Martin to Nordstrom.

Competitors try to nap, or they sit around eating junk food, he said. Then, the match locations are announced. “You run in there and you’re immediately this sophisticated young person talking eloquently to the judge,” Kinville, 17, said. “It’s an adrenaline rush too, to go in there and attack your opponent on something you’ve both been learning about.” Kinville has been a member of Madison’s speech and debate team for three years. His interest in the team grew from a “bandwagon approach” to a sophomore debate class. “You come into high school and that’s one of the classes everybody takes, that or speech. A lot of my friends were taking it so I figured ‘Why not? I’ll do it.’ And I just got hooked,” Kinville said. Ryan had shown a penchant for verbal matches long before high school, mother Nancy Kinville said. Ryan and his brother, four years older, have held months-long running debates since they were children, she said, including one that began in a Wal-Mart check out line to figure out what constitutes the color pink. “Ryan loves debate because he’s a very logical thinker. He likes to think outside the box, and he loves to see others’ points of view,” Nancy said. “He’s also a hard worker and loves the challenge. He’s always been that way.” Ryan is balancing speech and debate with four AP classes this term, along with his duties as student council president. He may attend Brigham Young University or University of Utah next year, possibly on a pre-law path. The speech and debate season begins in November and ends in February, followed by the postseason. Ryan will compete at the state competition in March in Boise; he’ll try to qualify for the national championship to be held in Birmingham, Ala., in the summer. Ryan was among eight Madison students to make last year’s national competition in Salt Lake City. “Just being in a convention center surrounded by thousands of people who are interested, motivated and who worked as hard as you did to qualify to get there was exceptional, to be around those people and see how much this event transforms their lives,” Ryan said. Speech and debate provides more than a venue to compete, he said. “I also enjoy what I get from it. So much has changed in my ability to communicate with people after participating for just three years. I feel a lot more confident, especially around other people, or in situations where people would be hesitant to talk in front of groups. I have no inhibitions for that anymore; I just kind of go for it,” Ryan said.

In 1962, the store moved to the corner of 35th and Calumet, once the home of the famed Sunset Café, owned by Louie Armstrong. In the mid-50's it was the Grand Terrance, a jazz mecca. A mural from back in the day still adorn the walls of Meyers' office from when greats like Ella Fitzgerald played the club. But times have changed, and so has the hardware business. Now Meyers finds himself in debt. "I have the pressure from Home Depot, and Amazon, and Walmart, keeping my prices down, but I need to raise my prices to pay the property tax bill," he said. Despite the building's landmark status, Meyers says it didn’t fetch a big enough price for him to retire comfortably. So as emotional as it for the customers, it's even harder for Meyers, who doesn’t know what he’s going to do. "I used to cut class in high school to come work in the store," he said. "I've never had another job." Meyers said he’s never hired a white person to work there, because he believes in giving back to the community he serves. He says if they shop here, they should be able to make money there too. The community has responded to news of the closing in a big way: they are throwing him a party on March 17, and jazz musician George Freeman will be performing.

By: Lucie Edwardson Metro Published on In the early hours of July 14, 2014, while under surveillance by the Calgary police, Douglas Garland attempted to return to his family's farm, court heard Wednesday.   Douglas Garland, 57, is charged with three counts of first-degree murder in the summer 2014 deaths of Alvin and Kathy Liknes and their five-year-old grandson Nathan O'Brien. Court heard Wednesday from two members of the Calgary Police Service Strike Force Unit- CPS surveillance team. The officers told jurors of how they were tasked with following "T5" – code for Douglas Garland – in July 2014. On the night of July 13 into the early hours of July 14 the officer detailed tailing Garland when, after purchasing a flashlight and gloves from Wal-Mart, he drove past his family's farm before ultimately attempting to walk onto the property from a back road. Blood showed signs of 'clean up' in kitchen of Liknes home: Analyst DNA from all three victims located at Garland farm: Expert Aerial photographs believed to show bodies on Garland farm Baby tooth identified by forensic dentist in materials from Garland farm Const. Richard Massicotte said it's at that point that a marked police car already on the farm moved towards where Garland was walking and shone their lights at him. Massicotte said Garland took off, running away from police and into the tall grass of the field. "There were two constables in pursuit of him at that point," said Massicotte, “They kept saying he was 10 feet in front of them, 15 feet in front and we were wondering how they hadn’t caught him.” Massicotte said the constables became separated, but one officer remained on Garland’s heels as he disappeared into a tree line. According to Massicotte, he and other members of the Strike Force Team quickly figured out why it had been difficult to catch Garland as they drove into the grass in a truck—becoming engulfed in the thick pasture. Once at the treeline, Massicotte said HAWCS shone their lights down at the area. He said he could hear Garland moving around in the bush, and called him by name to surrender. “Douglas Garland, this is city police come out of the bushes,” Massicotte told court he yelled. Garland then emerged from the bushes and was arrested.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid By Lisa Baertlein Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) on Wednesday said it is closing some stores and increasing use of customer data to improve results after cutting its full-year sales and profit forecasts after posting its sixth straight quarter of same-store sales declines. Shares in the organic and natural food grocer were down 2.1 percent in extended trading. "We're examining every aspect of our retail operations," Whole Foods co-founder John Mackey, who recently resumed the role of sole chief executive officer after the departure of co-CEO Walter Robb, said on a conference call with analysts. Whole Foods has been battling intense competition from rivals that include Kroger Co (KR.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), as well as new competitors such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and meal kit provider Blue Apron. The company has been lowering prices and experimenting with its value-oriented 365 by Whole Foods Market chain, as it tries to shed its unflattering "Whole Paycheck" nickname. Mackey said the company is "doubling down" on its most loyal customers, continue to lower prices and taking other steps to improve profitability and efficiency. "What has become clear is that we don't want to compete in a 'race to the bottom' as consumers have ever increasing choices for how much and where they shop," Mackey said. Whole Foods has closed one commissary kitchen and will be closing nine stores and the company's last two remaining commissary kitchens in the current quarter. It also terminated two leases. Mackey said the majority of the stores slated for closure were smaller, older acquisitions and that shuttering them should improve results. Whole Foods also is teaming up with dunnhumby, a private, wholly owned consumer data subsidiary of Tesco Plc, in a bid to catch up with Kroger and other rivals that already use such information to improve merchandising and personalize offers to loyal customers. The organic and natural food grocer on Wednesday said same-store sales fell a sharper-than-expected 2.4 percent in the fiscal first quarter ended Jan. 15, the sixth straight quarterly drop. That decline accelerated to 3.2 percent for the current second quarter through Feb. 5. Whole Foods it expects sales for the year to rise 1.5 percent or greater, compared with its previous forecast of growth of 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent. It also cut its profit forecast for the year to $1.33 per share or greater, from its previous view of $1.42 or greater. First-quarter revenue rose 1.9 percent to $4.92 billion from a year earlier. Net income fell to $95 million, or 30 cents per share, from $157 million, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier. The company said it incurred a charge of about 9 cents per share in the quarter, related to Robb's separation agreement and store closures. It expects to incur an additional charge related to the closures of about 6 cents per share in the current quarter.

Photo: REUTERS/Mike Segar This story was produced in conjunction with the nonprofit news publication Capital & Main. Torrance Chambers has been calling Andy Puzder for weeks to talk to him about a problem with his paycheck from the Hardee's restaurant where he works in Birmingham, Alabama. Ordinarily, Chambers wouldn’t bother the CEO of the fast-food chain’s parent company, CKE, Inc., but he claims his shift leader, store manager and several higher-ups told him no one else could help. Chambers said his store issues paychecks only in the form of a prepaid Visa debit card — and it comes with fees. He’d prefer to get a paper check or a direct deposit, the way he has at other jobs. “In order to get the money out the card, you have to go to the ATM, and the one I have to go to, they charge $3.95 for every transaction I have,” said Chambers. He said he’s been charged different fees for using the card in stores and for paying his bills, and there’s no option to get his full paycheck at any particular bank or store without being charged. “Including food and gas and everything, in a week, total, I’m out $80 [just on transaction fees]. And I’m only getting paid roughly $250 a week,” he said. These fees mean that Chambers’ real wages are significantly less than the national minimum wage required by law, $7.25 an hour. Having received no return call from Puzder, Chambers filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor on January 25, 2017, alleging minimum-wage violations related to the cards, as well as other problems at the store. CKE did not respond to queries related to this article. It’s not the first such complaint against the company, as a 2014  Department of Labor investigation found that the company’s use of debit cards violated minimum wage laws. The agency ordered CKE to pay $2,071.98 to an undisclosed number of employees, again at a Hardee's in Alabama, for similarly issuing cards that incurred fees. Investigation documents state outright that the company refused to pay the money, stating it would mean “changing the payroll practices of the company,” but it is unclear how the case was resolved or if any changes to the payroll cards were ever made. CKE is one of many employers now paying with plastic. Prepaid debit cards are a common way to pay employees at American mega-employers like Walmart and Home Depot, as well as many other burger chains such as McDonald’s, Burger King and Sonic Drive-In. Almost half of U.S. states pay their government employees with cards. The cards are usually offered as an option for those employees who don’t have bank accounts and want to avoid high fees at check-cashing locations. According to a 2016 report by Restaurant Opportunities Centers (ROC) United, an advocacy group for restaurant employees, 7.4 million American workers received their payroll via debit card in 2015, and that number is expected to rise to 12.2 million by 2019. The cards are popular with some employees and very popular with payroll companies, who see huge savings by going paperless. The ROC United report found, for instance, that Darden Restaurants, the parent chain of Olive Garden, Yard House and LongHorn Steak House restaurants, saved $2.75 per check per pay period by going to plastic, saving the company $5 million a year. In New York City, Deyanira Del Río, co-director of the New Economy Project, which helped implement new state rules regarding payroll card use, said that in surveying New York state workers, NEP, Retail Action Project and NYPIRG found two egregious problems that she compared directly to what Chambers said he experienced with Hardee's in Alabama: Some workers could not access their full pay without paying some kind of fee; and workers said they were coerced or pressured by management into taking the card even if there were other options like direct deposit or a paper check. Chambers said he was unaware if any other option existed, because multiple managers informed him he could not have a paper check or direct deposit. “On the part of employers, the motivation is to offset the costs of their payroll processing,” said NEP Campaigns Coordinator Andy Morrison. NEP led a labor-civil rights working group that pressed for the New York rules, which go into effect next month  and are touted as the toughest in the nation. Plastic payroll is cheaper and also harder to track, since there’s no paystub or statement. The payroll card companies, which are often the same or affiliated companies as the rest of the prepaid debit card industry that is dominated by such giants as Visa and Mastercard, can offer cheaper services to employers because they make huge profits on all those card fees. This schedule of fees, as provided by the 2016 ROC United study and other  reports, shows just how many times the card company is touching a worker’s money: ATM fee, typically anywhere from $1 to $3.95 Point of Sale (swipe) fee (the merchant also pays an interchange fee on this) ATM balance inquiry fee Optional paper statement fee Point of Sale decline fee Overdraft fee Card-to-card transfer fee Fee to talk to customer service if there is a problem (such as the payroll not loading on payday, which is a common occurrence) Monthly maintenance fee Card replacement fee Inactivity fee if the card isn’t used often enough Del Rio pointed out that the cards are marketed as a vehicle to help the low-wage worker manage his or her money by limiting the amount they can spend — since the cards are not linked to other accounts or to a card that would cover over-limit spending — but most workers don’t realize they’ll still get dinged for hitting the limit. “These payroll cards are supposed to help you manage your spending and not go over, but you can actually trigger overdraft fees with a lot of these cards. And those can be quite high, like $30 to $40,” she said. The ROC United study detailed other hidden problems that put workers into the red. For instance, Darden employees interviewed for their study found that some gas stations put a hold on a prepaid debit card for $75 to $150 and left it on there for several days. Employees unaware of the hold often went over their card’s limit or got POS declines, incurring more fees, causing them to call in to make a balance inquiry — which also incurred more fees — and reported not having the money they needed on time to pay their rent and other expenses. The study surmised: “Payroll cards should be offered as one of several free and safe ways for workers to receive their wages rather than be used as a vehicle for steering employees towards costly and unwieldy accounts.” To date, Alabama has no state regulations governing the issuance of payroll debit cards. Federal regulations don’t directly address them, either, other than requiring that payroll cards be insured with deposit insurance (unlike other prepaid debit cards). But in 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — the agency created by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protect Act passed in the wake of the Great Recession — issued a  stern warning  that federal law prohibits employers from mandating that workers take their pay on plastic. They must also be offered a choice of a paper check or a direct deposit. Acknowledging that the bureau had received reports that employers in the retail and food service industries were forcing their workers to take the cards, CFPB director Richard Cordray said at the time, “Today’s release warns employers that they cannot mandate that their employees receive wages on a payroll card. And for those employees who choose to receive wages on a payroll card, they are entitled to certain federal protections.” Hardee’s employees in Birmingham had filed complaints in the past claiming the company forced them to take the cards. The 2014 Department of Labor investigation into Hardee's in Birmingham addressed these claims and interviewed a company district manager who said that employees were required to take the plastic card for their first check and they could then receive their pay via direct deposit. Two years later, Torrance Chambers and at least one other employee in his store – which may not be the same store investigated in 2014 – insist that they were told it’s the card or nothing. One of the significant findings of the 2015-16 workgroup led by the New Economy Project was that workers were coerced into accepting the cards, regardless if other options were available. They even found one company that was taking a tiny kickback from the card company for every new account they enrolled in the card. Subsequently, New York’s new labor rules expressly prohibit coercing workers to use the cards. Morrison noted, “[New York’s new rules have] been trumpeted as the strongest in the nation, so in theory other states could follow suit." The 2014 Department of Labor investigation into Hardee's in Birmingham documents company pushback similar to that seen in New York. That investigation found that fees incurred while using payroll debit cards at “ATMs, gas stations and grocery stores” reduced the received wages to below $7.25 per hour, resulting in multiple  Section 206 (Minimum Wage)  violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act. A Hardee’s Vice President of Payroll, interviewed for the investigation but whose name was redacted from released documents, stated that the “’the card is designed to incur no fee’s [sic] and the employee’s [sic] should receive 100% of their money.’” The vice president pointed out that, at the time of his interview in 2014, the card should work without ATM fees at PLUS and INTERLINK ATMs and at Kangaroo gas stations, as well as some other places, but that “it is up to the employees to use the cards wisely” and that “all employees are told this when they start working here.” Chambers, who said he has been active in the movement to raise the minimum wage, ended up trying to call Puzder’s office to get help with his payroll card problems. Chambers, however, does not work for CKE itself, but rather for HNI LLC, a franchisee of the Hardee's chain. As detailed in Capital & Main’s companion piece about the relationship between CKE and its franchisees, the company demands that its franchisees adhere closely to what is referred to in its 45-page franchise agreement as the “System,” a zealously enforced operations guide regulating everything from burger look and taste to dining room design, to which products are used to clean the bathrooms — but which leaves employee hiring and firing, payroll and pricing to the franchisee. Related Stories Where Puzder Stands On Labor Issues Did Trump's Labor Secretary Nominee Target Longtime Managers? Which means that Puzder is under no obligation to call Chambers back. But all Chambers wants is for the big boss to show him some love. “Well, first off, if he’d show a little bit more concern with the employees, and come talk personally, then there wouldn’t be [any] complaints,” said Chambers. “[I want him to] just try to make it better for the employees and try to make them happy, and he’s the only one that can do it. Without his say-so, [there's] not going to be any progress with these issues.” Chambers thought that disqualified Puzder from being a good candidate for labor secretary. “It’s a terrible idea,” he said. “One, he’s not a people person. Two, he’s very inconsiderate. And furthermore, he’s just concerned about himself and no one else, so I really don’t think that he should be in that position.” Dean Kuipers is an L.A.-based writer on ecology and renewable energy, and the author of Burning Rainbow Farm.

Keely Meagan, 55, said she stopped because nationwide news about police officers injuring and killing black people had made her fear for the black driver's safety. "It felt at the time like the life of every black person pulled over by a police officer was at risk," Meagan said during her one-day trial Wednesday. Meagan faces a misdemeanor charge of interfering with a peace officer by refusing to obey a lawful order. She also was ticketed for alleged illegal stopping, standing or parking — a violation. Jackson County Circuit Judge David Hoppe will issue his ruling in the case Thursday. Meagan waived her right to a jury trial. On Sept. 8, 2016, an OSP trooper stopped the black driver and his passenger on I-5 near Exit 27 on the south side of Medford. Trooper Marc Williams then arrived to help handle the suspected case of driving under the influence of intoxicants. The driver admitted he had consumed marijuana within the last hour and consented to field sobriety tests, which he passed. The driver was not charged with DUII, but a tow truck was called to impound his vehicle because he was driving without insurance, according to court testimony. Meagan was driving on I-5 and did not see the field sobriety tests, but she testified she saw the driver with his hands on his head with the two troopers. She testified the driver appeared to be in a "vulnerable" position. Meagan parked on the I-5 shoulder behind the troopers, the driver and his passenger. She turned on her hazard lights, according to court testimony. "My intention simply was to observe. I was sending a nonverbal message to the officers and the young man that someone cared," Meagan said, adding that she wanted the officers to be on their best behavior. She said Williams demanded that she leave several times and threatened to arrest her and have her vehicle towed. "It made me wonder what he was trying to hide," Meagan said. Meagan testified she offered to park farther off the edge of I-5, but the trooper said that wouldn't work. He suggested she park at Walmart, but Meagan believed the situation would be over before she could walk back to continue observing. For his part, Williams said he told Meagan that parking her vehicle on the edge of I-5 was creating a safety hazard. He noted she was about 200 feet from an off-ramp and there was heavy rush-hour traffic on the interstate. "I advised her I was not opposed to her observing our traffic stop, but she needs to find a safer place to pull over," Williams testified. Williams said Meagan offered to drive onto a grassy slope, but he was concerned she could get stuck, creating an additional safety problem. Williams said Meagan's vehicle, which he described as a van, also may have been blocking the view of other drivers, who may not have been able to see the emergency lights flashing from his Dodge Charger patrol car. Meagan countered that her vehicle is a Pontiac Vibe and is about 5 feet tall. The Vibe is a hatchback automobile. Williams said he was not able to focus his attention on the driver and passenger, who were the subjects of the traffic stop. "I felt like I'm having to divide my attention between the defendant and the two subjects, who were becoming increasingly agitated. It was a safety concern, because I had to go talk to her," he said. Williams said while he was talking to Meagan, the other trooper had to deal with the two occupants of the stopped vehicle by himself. Also while he was talking to Meagan, he said, a passing truck with a travel trailer screeched its tires as the tires locked up. Williams said he pointed out to Meagan the danger of the passing truck and trailer. He said such dangers were exactly why he asked her to leave and park in a safer location. Williams said Meagan told him it is her duty to stop every time she sees a black man pulled over by police. Meagan said she needs to make sure drivers who are pulled over are safe, but Williams told her it is the duty of troopers to keep such drivers safe. On the verge of tears, Meagan testified she was compelled to stop because she didn't want to learn later that the man had been killed, or wonder the next day whether he was still alive. Long an environmental and social justice activist, Meagan is the author of the online essay "How Whites Can Say 'Black Lives Matter,'" which she posted in 2015. The courtroom was crowded with her supporters on Wednesday. Also a driver education teacher, Meagan said she stopped despite her fears she could lose her job. She testified the I-5 shoulder is a place to pull over in case of emergencies or other serious circumstances. "It's not a place to use lightly, but it is a place that is available to you if you need it," she said. Meagan said she teaches people to drive safely and would never encourage them to defy a police officer. Under cross examination by Jackson County Deputy District Attorney Jordan Bailey, Meagan said she saw no guns, saw no physical violence and didn't see anyone in handcuffs when she stopped. "There was no immediate threat to this individual," Bailey said of the driver who had been pulled over by troopers. "She was going off a gut feeling." Meagan said the role of a police officer includes keeping people safe and enforcing the rules of the road. Meagan said after watching an OSP video of the incident, she understood why the troopers were concerned about the situation. In her closing argument, defense attorney Lisa Janoski said Meagan was not creating a danger by stopping temporarily on the side of I-5 with her hazard lights on. She said Meagan had a right to observe the situation. "She was there to make a statement. She was there to protect an African-American," Janoski said. Bailey closed the prosecution's case by saying Meagan had constitutionally protected rights to observe the situation — but not when she was creating a danger for herself, the driver and passenger who were stopped, the troopers and passing motorists. She never would have been charged if she had been in a safe spot, Bailey said. "We need to preserve Ms. Meagan's rights, but we also need to make sure law enforcement can do its job," he said. — Reach staff reporter Vickie Aldous at 541-776-4486 or valdous@mailtribune.com.

It's the biggest remodeling investment ever for the Batavia-based company.   By Leslie Patton Bloomberg News Batavia-based lowbrow grocer Aldi is making things a little more posh, part of a plan to steal market share from the big supermarket chains. The discounter is spending $1.6 billion to upgrade 1,300 U.S. stores while keeping its prices low. It's the biggest remodeling investment ever by Aldi U.S., which is controlled by a faction of Germany's billionaire Albrecht family. "We're becoming more and more mainstream with more customers," Aldi U.S. Chief Executive Officer Jason Hart said in an interview as he toured a remodeled location in Plainfield. "We've got older stores. We need to get up to date." The remodeling comes as supermarkets are competing fiercely with Wal-Mart and Amazon to draw customers with lower prices, streamlined selections and even services like delivery. Aldi's plans may allow it to steal share from foodie favorites such as Whole Foods Market Inc. and Trader Joe's, which is controlled by a different bloc of the Albrecht clan. Aldi hopes to draw about 60 million shoppers a month by 2020, up from about 40 million currently, but it faces an uphill climb. U.S. grocery industry sales are projected to increase only 0.2 percent this year to about $612 billion, according to researcher IBISWorld. And revenue is forecast to gain 1 percent or less for the next five years after that. "There's limited growth," said Jim Sanderson, managing director at Arthur W. Wood Co., an investment firm. "For the typical U.S. grocery store, there's just too much square footage right now." Even so, there's still room for private-label chains like Aldi to expand, Sanderson said. The chain is projected to reach $12 billion in revenue this year, up from $11 billion two years ago, according to IBISWorld. "You've got under-penetration of the hard discounters, which is what Aldi is," he said. About 300 Aldi stores in the U.S. already have the new look. The upgrades include sleeker refrigerator doors and windows to bring in more natural light. The company is widening the first aisle, expanding the front of the store and raising ceilings by as much as six feet (1.8 meters). The stores also are about 20 percent larger, allowing Aldi to add more items to its quickly growing lines of organic produce, fresh meat and alcohol. The wine is housed in fancier wood fixtures with spotlights. A picture by the fresh meat shows a rare-cooked steak being cut and seasoned. "It's a modern shopping experience," Hart said. With its no-frills approach -- bag-your-own groceries, 25-cent cart rentals, giant quick-to-scan bar codes -- Aldi has managed to sell its wares for less than others. It advertises that customers can save up to 50 percent by shopping there. And the chain won't be raising its signature low prices to pay for the remodels, Hart said. "Although they are trying to add more organic options and things like that, it's important to keep the customers they have," said Madeline Hurley, an analyst at IBISWorld. "The balance is crucial."

The holiday celebrating love is the perfect time for some of hip-hop’s finest to flex their creativity when it comes to wining and dining their significant other. For RiFF RAFF, it’s also a moment to showcase his skills when it comes to making a Valentine’s Day Card the Jody HiGHROLLER way. The rapper, who dropped his Aquaberry Aquarius project last month, stopped by XXL to provide step-by-step instructions on how to make a greeting card without going the traditional Hallmark route. “You could go to the Walmart aisle and be like, Okay, I’ma get a… card, but why do that when you can go spend extra money and go make a card out of RiFF RAFF or Jody HiGHROLLER quotes,” he shares. The inspiration for his hip-hop Hallmark is a play on the lyrics to the track “Only in America,” off his Peach Panther album. Using scissors, glue, crystallized paper (“Some nice magentas, you got some black licorice [and] of course you got the emerald green medallions”) and a surprise addition, RiFF RAFF creates the ultimate Valentine’s Day card all while he’s dressed to impress — check out that name-engraved belt buckle and his signature red braids.

Not exactly ‘elite’ Vikings release offensive guards Brandon Fusco, Mike Harris By Sarah Halzack, (c) 2017, The Washington Post WASHINGTON – In January, days before President Donald Trump’s inauguration, his daughter Ivanka Trump declared that she’d be stepping away from her management role at the clothing and shoe brand that bears her name. And yet, on Wednesday, the president lashed out on Twitter at department store Nordstrom over its decision to stop carrying Ivanka Trump products, saying his daughter “has been treated so unfairly” by the retailing giant: “My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!” The social media missive adds to a cloud of confusion swirling around the Trump administration about how the family’s business interests are colliding with Trump’s job at the White House. Sean Spicer, Trump’s press secretary, defended Trump’s tweet to reporters during a briefing on Wednesday, saying “He has every right to stand up for his family and applaud their business activities, their success.” Spicer also said, “This is a direct attack on his policies and her name.” Related Articles Minnesota county halts condom distribution DeVos fight stokes Minnesota’s debate over charters, school choice Fewer Minnesotans buy individual health insurance, but more use MNsure and get help paying Charles Samuelson, longtime Minnesota ACLU head, steps down Senate panel narrowly approves Real ID changes Nordstrom on Wednesday doubled down on its earlier remarks on the matter, saying the move was based on sales results, not politics. In a statement, a spokeswoman said: “To reiterate what we’ve already shared when asked, we made this decision based on performance. Over the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn’t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now. We’ve had a great relationship with the Ivanka Trump team. We’ve had open conversations with them over the past year to share what we’ve seen and Ivanka was personally informed of our decision in early January.” Trump’s reproach of the company comes as a growing slate of retailers appear to be backing away from the Ivanka Trump brand. Neiman Marcus is no longer offering fine jewelry from the label on its website. Belk said on Wednesday that it is no longer selling Ivanka Trump merchandise on its website, though it continues to carry it in stores. “We continually review our assortment and the performance of the brands we carry. We make adjustments as part of our normal course of business operations,” the company said in a statement. A campaign called Grab Your Wallet has been urging shoppers to boycott retailers and other companies connected with the Trump family business empire. It encourages consumers to stay away from retailers that carry Ivanka Trump products as well as businesses such as Trump wineries and golf courses. President Trump’s adult children have been visible figures in the early days of their father’s administration. Ivanka Trump was at the table last week for a gathering of the president’s Business Advisory Council, a meeting that was attended by chief executives of corporate behemoths such as Walmart, PepsiCo and IBM. Her brothers, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., appeared recently at the event announcing Neil Gorsuch as President Trump’s pick for an open seat on the Supreme Court. Moves like these have had critics asking how much distance there is between the president and his family’s business empire. His sons are running the Trump Organization during his presidency. And while Ivanka has taken a “formal leave of absence” from the Trump Organization, it’s not clear that she has relinquished her financial interests in it. President Trump has declined to divest his own stake in his business. Richard Painter, a former chief White House ethics counsel under George W. Bush, called President Trump’s tweet about Nordstrom a “misuse of public office for private gains.” “I have never seen a senior administration official lash out at a particular company based upon a strictly personal grudge,” Painter said in an e-mail. Painter is a professor of corporate law at the University of Minnesota and is part of a team that has filed a lawsuit which alleges that President Trump is violating a constitutional provision known as the emoluments clause, which forbids him from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments. The president’s criticism of Nordstrom exemplifies the uncharted territory that Corporate America finds itself in during the Trump era. During his campaign and since his election victory, Trump has not shied away from ripping into specific companies. He has criticized General Motors for making cars overseas, and suggested that an order from Boeing for a new Air Force One jet should be canceled because of its costs. Perhaps as part of an effort to keep out of Trump’s crosshairs, big names such as Walmart and Amazon.com have touted their plans for creating thousands of jobs in the United States – catnip for a president who has pledged to be the country’s “greatest jobs president.” (Jeffrey Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) Meanwhile, the fractious political climate has lit the fuse on several consumer boycotts, leaving big companies to try to unravel what these outcries actually mean for their reputations and bottom line. For example, days after President Trump signed an executive order that barred refugees and others from seven majority-Muslim nations from coming to the United States, Starbucks announced that it planned to hire 10,000 refugees. On social media, calls quickly bubbled up for consumers to boycott Starbucks. Uber, the ride-hailing company, saw more than 200,000 users delete the app from their phones after a “#DeleteUber” campaign sprang up on social media. It arose after the company said it was dropping its surge pricing during a protest at John F. Kennedy International Airport over Trump’s travel ban. Some interpreted that move that undermined a protest by taxi drivers who were staying away from the airport to show their disapproval of the ban. And while Grab Your Wallet had encouraged shoppers to boycott Nordstrom for carrying Ivanka Trump apparel, now a new round of boycott talk is simmering that targets the department store chain, this time from shoppers who are outraged with the retailer for dropping the line. — The Washington Post’s John Wagner contributed to this report.

Though Whole Foods plans to open six stores during the current quarter, including two relocations, the company said Wednesday that it’s shutting down nine. That kind of retrenchment hasn’t happened since the last recession was underway in 2008. The company, which about 440 U.S. stores, also said it was abandoning its ambitious growth target and no longer plans to reach 1,200 locations as it tries to get expenses under control. Six straight quarters of declining same-store sales -- a closely watched measure -- have forced the organic-food grocer to tighten its belt. Whole Foods also gave a forecast for the current year that offered little hope of a quick recovery. “This is a company that owned the space for a long time, but there’s way too much competition now,” said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones. “They’ve done several things to try and drive sales, and it’s just not working.” Same-store sales dropped 2.4 percent last quarter, worse than the 1.7 percent decrease predicted by analysts. The company now expects sales on that basis to decline as much as 2.5 percent this year, compared with an earlier forecast that was closer to break-even. “People were hoping there would be some improvement,” said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s a bit concerning there’s not a reversal happening there.” Mainstream Competition Whole Foods has struggled to ward off competition from mainstream supermarkets, including Kroger Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which began offering more organic fare in recent years. And a bout of food deflation has put additional pressure on the entire industry. Some on Wall Street have been pushing Whole Foods to rein in its growth plans, and the store plan was received warmly. The stock gained 2 percent percent to $29.91 at 10:02 a.m. in New York on Thursday. Prior to the drop, it was down 4.7 percent in 2017. Responsibility for the turnaround is now squarely on John Mackey, a co-founder of the company who retook sole leadership last year. He had served as co-chief executive officer with Walter Robb until November. He has an uphill fight ahead. Same-store sales declined 3.2 percent in the current quarter through Feb. 5, a sign its troubles are worsening. The Austin, Texas-based company also said it would no longer be reporting quarter-to-date figures in future reports, meaning investors will have less to go on. Activist Threat? Whole Foods’ struggles have fueled speculation that an activist investor could take on the chain, and one of its largest shareholders is said to have to discussed agitating for sweeping changes. For years, Whole Foods offered products that were tough to find elsewhere, and the shares gave investors exposure to the fast-growing market for organic and natural food. But that advantage has eroded in recent years. With sales growth stagnating last year, Whole Foods announced $300 million in cost cuts. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up But the company is still ramping up spending elsewhere, including on marketing and technology, and that’s expected to offset the cutbacks. It also introduced a new store concept last year aimed at younger, budget-conscious consumers. So far, only three of the locations -- dubbed 365 by Whole Foods Market -- have opened on the West Coast. The company announced on Wednesday that it has signed leases for new 365 stores in Brooklyn, New York, and Oakland, California. The new concept, named after the company’s private-label brand, is seen as a way for Whole Foods to connect with shoppers who perceive the chain’s conventional stores as too pricey. Whole Foods considered turning some of the stores it was closing into 365 locations, but it wasn’t practical, Mackey said. In some cases the company wanted to “thin out” its presence in a particular market, with the hope that it benefits Whole Foods locations nearby. Some of the stores had leases coming up in 2017, and management decided to accelerate the process and close them now. The decision to shutter the nine stores will help boost profits and comparable sales, Mackey said on a conference call. The company is taking a more disciplined approach to growth but still has 80 stores in the pipeline, he said. “We cleaned up the stores we needed to clean up for the time being, and we’re looking forward to moving forward,” Mackey said.

Republican Senior Statesmen Promote Carbon Tax Plan - Irish Sun Issue 042/15 Irish Sun        http://www.irishsun.com   Ireland News Breaking International News Breaking Business News Europe Sports News Dublin News Economics News Belfast News Breaking Internet News Web Site Development News Healthcare News Ireland News Utilities News Republican Senior Statesmen Promote Carbon Tax Plan VOA Wednesday 8th February, 2017 Their plan would also set 'border adjustments' based on carbon, which would result in fees for products from countries without similar carbon pricing systems. And they would seek to roll back regulations enacted under President Barack Obama, including the Clean Power Plan. So far, Trump has sent mixed signals on whether or how he will try to slow Earth's warming temperatures and rising sea levels. During the transition, Trump met with prominent climate activists Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio. Ivanka Trump, a close adviser to her father, has indicated interest in working on the issue. But the president has also hired oil industry champions who want to reverse Obama's efforts to rein in emissions. The White House press office did not immediately respond to request for comment. Also supporting Baker's effort are Hank Paulson, treasury secretary for former President George W. Bush; Greg Mankiw, who chaired Bush's Council of Economic Advisers; and Marty Feldstein, chairman of President Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, according to the person familiar with the plans. Also on the list are former Wal-Mart Chairman Rob Walton; Thomas Stephenson, a partner at the venture capital firm Sequoia Capital; and Ted Halstead, founder of New America and the Climate Leadership Council. The vast majority of peer-reviewed studies and climate scientists agree the planet is warming, mostly because of man-made sources. Under Obama, the U.S. has dramatically ramped up production of renewable energy from sources like solar, in part through Energy Department grants. Sanders backed tax Some environmental activists support a tax on emissions to help transition off fossil fuels. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders advocated for a carbon tax as part of his bid for the Democratic nomination last year. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, never supported a tax, though she offered a slew of proposals to deal with climate change. Trump's secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, was the longtime chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil. Exxon was long considered a leading opponent of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels. But under Tillerson's leadership, Exxon has started planning for climate change and even voiced support for a carbon tax. Trump's choice to run the Environmental Protection Agency is Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, who denies climate change science. And Trump's nominee to run the Energy Department, former Texas Governor Rick Perry, also has questioned climate science while working to promote coal-fired power in Texas. He did, however, oversee the growth of renewable power in Texas, which became a leading wind-energy producer while he was governor. Carbon tax legislation is unlikely to receive a warm welcome in the GOP-controlled Congress, where Republicans were staunchly opposed to Obama's climate agenda. Last year, Republicans in the House approved symbolic measures opposing a fee on crude oil and a carbon tax on emissions.

Reuters Published Wednesday, Feb. 08, 2017 4:35PM EST Last updated Wednesday, Feb. 08, 2017 4:52PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Whole Foods Market Inc cuts its sales and profit forecasts for the year, citing lower-than-expected sales growth and costs related to store closures. The organic and natural food grocer also said sales at established stores fell in the first quarter, declining for the sixth quarter in a row, and were on track to drop in the current quarter as well. Whole Foods’ shares fell 3.2 per cent to $28.35 in trading after the bell on Wednesday. The company said it expects sales for the year to rise 1.5 per cent or greater, compared with its previous forecast of growth of 2.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent. It cut its profit forecast for the year to $1.33 per share or greater, from its previous view of $1.42 or greater. Whole Foods has been grappling with intense competition from rivals that include Kroger Co and Wal-Mart Stores Inc as well as new competitors such as Amazon.com and meal kit provider Blue Apron. The company has been lowering prices and experimenting with its value-oriented 365 by Whole Foods Market chain, as it tries to shake its “Whole Paycheck” reputation. Whole Foods has also been streamlining its management, with co-founder John Mackey taking over as sole chief executive after Walter Robb, who had split CEO duties with Mackey for six years, stepped down last year. The company said sales at established stores fell 2.4 per cent in the first quarter ended Jan. 15. Analysts on average had expected a 1.7 per cent drop in same-store sales, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. The company said its same-store sales were down 3.2 per cent in the current quarter through Feb. 5. Whole Foods said it would not report quarter-to-date comparable store sales results going forward. Revenue rose to $4.92-billion in the first quarter from $4.83-billion a year earlier. Net income fell to $95-million, or 30 cents per share, from $157-million, or 46 cents per share. The company said it incurred a charge of about 9 cents per share in the quarter, related to Robb’s separation agreement and store closures. Whole Foods said it expects to incur an additional charge related to the closures of about 6 cents per share in the current quarter.

In Arkansas, the infrastructure is not in place to allow for self-driving trucks, but a form of the technology, known as platooning, could be implemented in the state if legislation allowed for it. The Arkansas Trucking Association (ATA) wants the legislation to allow for semitrailer platooning. Once engaged, the technology wirelessly syncs the lead truck to the one following, allowing the trucks to maintain a specific speed or following distance based on their load weight and to assist the drivers, such as automatically applying a truck’s brakes. Goals of platooning are improved safety and fuel economy. Legislation would be required to modify the minimum distance restriction between to vehicles, which is 200 feet, ATA President Shannon Newton said. Platooning would allow two trucks “to talk to one another” and travel together much more closely. “Platooning is not prohibited by law,” she said. Elements of platooning are similar to drafting, which is when one truck follows closely behind another to minimize wind drag, improving fuel economy. “Drafting is really not legal,” and it would likely remain illegal with the new legislation. The ATA and a technology vendor recently met with the Arkansas Highway Police, a division of the Arkansas Highway and Transportation Department, to discuss possible legislation that would provide for an exception to the minimum following distance requirement “but only when certain safety and technical requirements have been met,” said Danny Straessle, public information officer for the highway department. “We will be watching with great interest that which is put forth [in the legislature] by the Arkansas Trucking Association. We are waiting for additional information from the vendor so we can evaluate the proposed legislation and thus determine if we have any issues or opposition,” he said. The plan is to have legislation approved this year, since legislators won’t meet again for two years, Newton said. With the legislation in place, carriers could test the technology in the state. Several carriers have shown interest in the technology, including J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Wal-Mart Stores and FedEx Freight, which has planned routes. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 35,092 people died on U.S. roads in 2015, and 94% of crashes “can be tied to a human choice or error.” Automated vehicle technology “could dramatically decrease the number of crashes tied to human choices and behavior.” The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) “is also encouraged about the potential for [automated vehicle technology] to use other complementary senor technologies such as vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure capabilities to improve system performance.” Platooning would use the previous technology, and Peloton Technology, based in Mountain View, Calif., is a provider. Its Peloton System offers a combined fuel savings of 7%, at 4.5% for the lead truck and 10% for the following truck, according to the company’s website. “Drivers choose when to platoon and always retain primary control of their own trucks. They work together to save fuel and manage the changing environment.” AUTOMATION IMPACT While vehicle automation technology such as platooning will assist the driver, some debate remains over whether it will impact the driver shortage. Newton doesn’t expect it will impact the shortage and won’t lead to the need for fewer drivers. But the technology could attract more drivers to the industry because it could allow for more drivers to qualify to drive commercially. She compared the use of autonomous vehicle technology in the trucking industry to the airline industry and how each airplane still has two pilots even though they use autopilot to fly an airplane. Automation “is leveling the competitive landscape across the globe,” and the “ramifications for labor are monumental,” according to Stifel transportation analyst John G. Larkin. “Taken alone, autonomous trucks operating on the interstate highway system would likely eliminate the persistently challenging driver shortage and might destroy highway to rail intermodal conversion economics. Taken together with double 53s, triple 28s, platooning and/or other highly productive vehicle combinations and technologies, autonomous trucks could be the next transformational driver leading to a sizeable reduction in the ratio of logistics costs to GDP.” The NHTSA defines vehicle automation technology in the following six levels. • Level 0, no automation: driver is in complete control of the vehicle. • Level 1, automated system can “sometimes assist” the driver to handle “some parts” of driving. • Level 2, the system can do some of the driving, but the driver does the rest and must watch the “driving environment.” • Level 3, the system can drive and monitor “the driving environment in some instances,” but the driver must be available to take control of the vehicle if needed. • Level 4, the system can drive and “monitor the driving environment” without the driver needing to take control. However, the system can only operate in “certain environments and under certain conditions.” • Level 5, the system performs all the driving tasks that a driver could. Platooning meets the definition of level-one vehicle automation, but this past fall, Otto Motors, which is based in Canada and owned by Uber, used self-driving trucks to perform level-three vehicle automation tasks. In October, Otto and Anheuser-Busch teamed up to deliver 51,744 cans of beer using autonomous technology as “the world’s first commercial shipment by self-driving truck,” according to a news release. A driver let the computer take control of the truck and watched from its sleeper berth as it “hauled a fully loaded trailer of Budweiser beer more than 120 miles on I-25 from Fort Collins, Colo., through Denver, to Colorado Springs.” In November, an Otto self-driving truck operated a similar task in Ohio. Before he met a team of Otto engineers, Joe Rajkovacz, director of governmental affairs and communications for the nonprofit Western States Trucking Association (WSTA), was skeptical of the technology. Just say self-driving trucks in trucking circles, “and you are likely to get an earful about how this technology should never replace having a human driver behind the wheel,” he wrote. But after seeing a self-driving truck in operation, Rajkovacz said he is no longer a skeptic. The concept, he wrote, is “nearing reality today. Although technological and regulatory hurdles still lie ahead, they will be solved.” LEGISLATION NEEDED Rep. Mike Holcomb, R-Pine Bluff, chairman of the public transportation committee in the House and previously committee vice chair, has yet to see legislation regarding autonomous vehicles, but he expects a law to be in place before it would be allowed in the state. Sen. Eddie Williams, R-Cabot, also was unaware of any legislation regarding automated vehicles, and said a conversation about it is one he “wouldn’t even dream of having” three to five years ago. Williams, who worked nearly 40 years for Union Pacific Railroad, and Holcomb were co-chairs of an intermodal transportation and commerce task force that looked into the intermodal segment in the state. The vision of Otto and Anheuser-Busch for the technology includes reducing roadway fatalities, decreasing emissions and “enhancing truck utilization and providing a sustainable solution for the driver shortage that continues to put pressure on drivers to work long hours at the risk of safe driving,” according to a news release. “One major opportunity for Otto’s technology is that drivers will be able to rest during long stretches of highway, and perhaps even catch up on sleep. That begs the question of whether the driver is ‘on-duty’ with respect to hours of service laws while they are resting.” The hours of service regulation limits truck drivers to 11-hours of driving per day after 10 consecutive hours off duty, according to Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. Also, drivers cannot drive after the 14th consecutive hour after coming on duty, and they must take a 30-minute break from driving at least every eight hours. A driver is also limited to driving 60 hours per week or 70 hours over eight consecutive days. On Jan. 16, the DOT’s 25-member automation committee met for the first time “to immediately begin work on some of the most pressing and relevant matters facing transportation today, including the development and deployment of automated vehicles,” according to a news release. Committee member Chris Spear, who is president and CEO of American Trucking Associations, said the transportation industry “must embrace technology for the betterment of safety, the environment, productivity, but also to do it thoughtfully in ways that do not impeded our employment base, particularly in the trucking sector,” according to Transport Topics, a publication of the trade organization.

The victim recently received a call from a male suspect who said he was a family member who had been arrested and needed bail money to get out of prison following a DUI crash in New York, police said.  The suspect told the man that he needed him to send him $2,500 via a money transfer service at a local Walmart, according to police.  After sending the money, the victim received another call from the suspect Wednesday, police said. The suspect told the man he needed even more money, following his initial hearing with the judge, police said. The victim sent an additional $2,500.  After receiving the money, the suspect called the victim a third time and asked for an additional $2,140, which he said would be used to pay for medical bills related to the owner of the struck vehicle, police said. The suspect said police would send him to "county" if the victim didn't send the money. The victim refused to send the suspect cash following the third call, and reported the incident to police.  Anyone who receives a similar call should not send money to the caller via wiring service without verifying the arrest, police said.  Robber with terrible timing sentenced to 7 to 14 years in state prison Most Read PENNLIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA Facebook Twitter Instagram Pinterest Tumblr Active Discussions Get 'Today's Front Page' in your inbox This newsletter is sent every morning at 6 a.m. and includes the morning's top stories, a full list of obituaries, links to comics and puzzles and the most recent news, sports and entertainment headlines.

Shares in the organic and natural food grocer were down 2.1 percent in extended trading. "We're examining every aspect of our retail operations," Whole Foods co-founder John Mackey, who recently resumed the role of sole chief executive officer after the departure of co-CEO Walter Robb, said on a conference call with analysts. Whole Foods has been battling intense competition from rivals that include Kroger Co and Wal-Mart Stores Inc , as well as new competitors such as Amazon.com Inc and meal kit provider Blue Apron. The company has been lowering prices and experimenting with its value-oriented 365 by Whole Foods Market chain, as it tries to shed its unflattering "Whole Paycheck" nickname. Mackey said the company is "doubling down" on its most loyal customers, continue to lower prices and taking other steps to improve profitability and efficiency. "What has become clear is that we don't want to compete in a 'race to the bottom' as consumers have ever increasing choices for how much and where they shop," Mackey said. Whole Foods has closed one commissary kitchen and will be closing nine stores and the company's last two remaining commissary kitchens in the current quarter. It also terminated two leases. Mackey said the majority of the stores slated for closure were smaller, older acquisitions and that shuttering them should improve results. Whole Foods also is teaming up with dunnhumby, a private, wholly owned consumer data subsidiary of Tesco Plc, in a bid to catch up with Kroger and other rivals that already use such information to improve merchandising and personalize offers to loyal customers. The organic and natural food grocer on Wednesday said same-store sales fell a sharper-than-expected 2.4 percent in the fiscal first quarter ended Jan. 15, the sixth straight quarterly drop. That decline accelerated to 3.2 percent for the current second quarter through Feb. 5. Whole Foods it expects sales for the year to rise 1.5 percent or greater, compared with its previous forecast of growth of 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent. It also cut its profit forecast for the year to $1.33 per share or greater, from its previous view of $1.42 or greater. First-quarter revenue rose 1.9 percent to $4.92 billion from a year earlier. Net income fell to $95 million, or 30 cents per share, from $157 million, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier. The company said it incurred a charge of about 9 cents per share in the quarter, related to Robb's separation agreement and store closures. It expects to incur an additional charge related to the closures of about 6 cents per share in the current quarter.

Business Trump lashes out at Nordstrom in a tweet for dropping his daughter's apparel line What is the ‘Grab Your Wallet’ campaign? The "Grab Your Wallet" campaign is celebrating after Nordstrom said it will stop selling Ivanka Trump clothing and accessories. (Feb. 3, 2017) The "Grab Your Wallet" campaign is celebrating after Nordstrom said it will stop selling Ivanka Trump clothing and accessories. (Feb. 3, 2017) Sarah HalzackThe Washington Post In January, days before President Donald Trump's inauguration, his daughter Ivanka Trump declared that she'd be stepping away from her management role at the clothing and shoe brand that bears her name. And yet, on Wednesday, the president lashed out on Twitter at department store Nordstrom over its decision to stop carrying Ivanka Trump products, saying his daughter "has been treated so unfairly" by the retailing giant. "My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!" The social media missive adds to a cloud of confusion swirling around the Trump administration about how the family's business interests are colliding with Trump's job at the White House. Sean Spicer, Trump's press secretary, defended Trump's tweet to reporters during a briefing Wednesday, saying, "He has every right to stand up for his family and applaud their business activities, their success." Spicer also said, "This is a direct attack on his policies and her name." Nordstrom did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump's tweet, but the company previously said its decision to stop carrying Ivanka Trump goods was based on sales results, not politics. Each year, Nordstrom said in its statement, it prunes about 10 percent of the brands it carries based on performance. It's not clear why Trump believes his daughter was treated unfairly by Nordstrom if she is no longer involved in the label's operations. But his reproach of the company comes as a growing slate of retailers appear to be backing away from the Ivanka Trump brand. Neiman Marcus is no longer carrying fine jewelry from the label on its website, while Belk also no longer features Ivanka Trump clothes and accessories online. A campaign called Grab Your Wallet has been urging shoppers to boycott retailers and other companies connected with the Trump family business empire. It encourages consumers to stay away from retailers that carry Ivanka Trump products as well as businesses such as Trump wineries and golf courses. Trump's adult children have been visible figures in the early days of their father's administration. Ivanka Trump was at the table last week for a gathering of the president's Business Advisory Council, a meeting that was attended by chief executives of corporate behemoths such as Walmart, Pepsi and IBM. Her brothers, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., appeared recently at the event announcing Neil Gorsuch as Trump's pick for an open seat on the Supreme Court. Moves like these have had critics asking how much distance there is between the president and his family's business empire. His sons are running the Trump Organization during his presidency. And while Ivanka has taken a "formal leave of absence" from the Trump Organization, it's not clear that she has relinquished her financial interests in it. Trump has declined to divest his own stake in his business. The president's criticism of Nordstrom exemplifies the uncharted territory that corporate America finds itself in during the Trump era. During his campaign and since his election victory, Trump has not shied away from ripping into specific companies. He has criticized General Motors for making cars overseas, and suggested that an order from Boeing for a new Air Force One jet should be canceled because of its costs. Perhaps as part of an effort to keep out of Trump's crosshairs, big names such as Walmart and Amazon.com have touted their plans for creating thousands of jobs in the United States - catnip for a president who has pledged to be the country's "greatest jobs president." (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) Meanwhile, the fractious political climate has lit the fuse on several consumer boycotts, leaving big companies to try to unravel what these outcries actually mean for their reputations and bottom line. For example, days after Trump signed an executive order that barred refugees and others from seven majority-Muslim nations from coming to the United States, Starbucks announced that it planned to hire 10,000 refugees. On social media, calls quickly bubbled up for consumers to boycott Starbucks. Uber, the ride-hailing company, saw more than 200,000 users delete the app from their phones after a "#DeleteUber" campaign sprang up on social media. It arose after the company said it was dropping its surge pricing during a protest at John F. Kennedy International Airport over Trump's travel ban. And while Grab Your Wallet had encouraged shoppers to boycott Nordstrom for carrying Ivanka Trump apparel, now a new round of boycott talk is simmering that targets the department store chain, this time from shoppers who are outraged with the retailer for dropping the line.

The report, "The Conservative Case for Carbon Dividends," was published online Wednesday by the Climate Leadership Council. The paper acknowledged that the evidence for climate change is "mounting" and that while "the extent to which climate change is due to man-made causes can be questioned, the risks associated with future warming are too big and should be hedged." At the very least, the authors say, "we need an insurance policy." The team also said the populist allure of politicians such as President Donald Trump suggests a frustration and disaffection among many Americans who feel left behind by economic disruption and change. Taxing carbon and returning the money to ordinary citizens provides an unusual opportunity to provide relief for struggling Americans while hedging against the potential effects of climate change. The team behind the paper includes several men who have served in key roles in Republican administrations: former Secretary of the Treasury under George W. Bush (and one-time Goldman Sachs chairman and CEO) Henry M. Paulson Jr., and James A. Baker III, who served as secretary of State under George H.W. Bush, Treasury secretary under Ronald Reagan and chief of staff for both administrations. Harvard economics professor Martin Feldstein, also in the group, served as chairman of the President Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, and George P. Shultz served as Reagan's secretary of State and secretary of the Treasury and Labor under Richard Nixon, while Harvard economist N. Gregory Mankiw served as chairman of George W. Bush's President's Council of Economic Advisers. Other contributors include former Wal-Mart Chairman Rob Walton, venture capitalist Thomas Stephenson of Sequoia Capital (who served as Ambassador to Portugal under George W. Bush), and Climate Leadership Council founder, president and CEO Ted Halstead. The authors say economists "are nearly unanimous in their belief that a carbon tax is the most efficient and effective way to reduce carbon emissions," as opposed to caps on emissions or other regulations. Their plan has four pieces or stages. First, it calls for creating a gradually increasing carbon tax, that would be assessed at refineries, or at the place where fossil fuels enter the U.S. economy, such as wells, mines or ports. For example, a tax could start at $40 a ton, and then steadily increase over time. Second, the plan calls for returning that money to the American people as dividends, either through direct deposit, retirement plan contributions, or other means. A family of four could receive $2,000 in dividends in the first year of such a plan, and that would grow over time. The third step is establishing "border carbon adjustments that protect American competitiveness," by assessing taxes on imports from countries that don't have similar carbon tax plans. Exports sent to those same countries would be given rebates for the carbon taxes already paid in the U.S. Then, after the first three pieces are in place, the policymakers could begin rolling back other government regulations meant to prevent carbon pollution. That would include repealing the Clean Power Plan and removing the Environmental Protection Agency's carbon regulation responsibility, since such things would, in theory, be no longer necessary. The authors say such a program would help reduce the country's carbon footprint, while also providing support to many economically disaffected Americans. They cite an estimate from the Department of the Treasury, saying the bottom 70 percent of Americans, in terms of wealth, would "come out ahead under such a program." "Carbon dividends would increase the disposable income of the majority of Americans while disproportionately helping those struggling to make ends meet. Yet these dividends are not giveaways; they would be earned based on the good behavior of minimizing our carbon footprints." The notion of a carbon tax has proven unpopular among many Republican politicians, and some have expressed skepticism that climate change is occurring, or that it is influenced by human activity. For example, the Republican party platform during the last presidential campaign explicitly opposed any kind of carbon tax. But many polls have shown that climate change and carbon pollution are a concern to a majority of Americans, and that even a clear majority of Republicans acknowledge climate change is occurring. Polls conducted by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and George Mason University's Center for Climate Change Communication have found, for instance, that nearly half of all Republicans would support a carbon tax if other taxes were reduced to compensate. Thus the current report's writers say a carbon tax would reduce the potential for the potentially disastrous consequences of climate change, and offer Republicans a chance to repeal other current laws that might be even more burdensome than a carbon tax, reduce entanglements with oil-producing countries, and appeal to the concerns of a wide variety of Americans, including voters who are younger, or among the fast-growing groups of Latino and Asian Americans. They say the "plan could strengthen our economy, benefit working-class Americans, reduce regulations, protect our natural heritage and consolidate a new era of Republican leadership. These benefits accrue regardless of one's views on climate science." Robert FerrisScience Reporter

The newly formed Climate Leadership Council – which includes James Baker, Henry Paulson, George Shultz, Marty Feldstein and Greg Mankiw – is proposing elimination of nearly all of the Obama administration’s climate policies in exchange for a rising carbon tax that starts at $40 per ton, and is returned in the form of a quarterly check from the Social Security Administration to every American. “I really don’t know the extent to which it is manmade, and I don’t think anybody can tell you with certainty that it’s all manmade,” Baker said in an interview with the Washington Post. However, he also said, “the risk is sufficiently strong that we need an insurance policy and this is a damn good insurance policy.” Despite the group’s impeccable Republican credentials – Baker, Paulson and Schultz served as treasury secretaries, and Feldstein and Mankiw as CEA chairs under GOP presidents – the proposal faces long odds. Advertisement Continue reading Many congressional Republicans are adamantly against a tax increase of any kind, and President Trump repeatedly emphasized he is far more interested in promoting the extraction of fossil fuels in the United States than curbing the nation’s carbon emissions. A proposed carbon tax also failed recently in a ballot initiative in Washington state, in part because it divided the left – with many liberals wanting to use any revenue to invest in clean energy and other social causes rather than to return it to the public. Baker and his colleagues met Wednesday with Gary Cohn, the head of Trump’s National Economic Council, as well as speaking more briefly with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway. A White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations, said in an email it would be premature to conclude that the administration was embracing the idea of a carbon tax. “Secretary Baker is obviously a distinguished public servant with a wealth of experience,” the official said. “This morning is one of many listening meetings the administration is having with experts on a variety of issues and does not represent any eventual policy decision one way or the other.” The vice president’s spokesman, Marc Lotter, said in an email that Baker had requested the meeting over the weekend when they ran into each other “at the Super Bowl on Sunday. The Secretary mentioned going to the White House and the Vice President asked him to pop by his office while he is here.” As for how the idea would be received politically, Baker said, “I have no idea but it is a good proposal, it’s simple, it’s conservative, it’s free market, it’s limited government.” Other supporters of the group’s proposal include Ted Halstead, who founded the Climate Leadership Council and previously the New America Foundation, Rob Walton, the former chairman of the board of Walmart, and Thomas Stevenson, a U.S. ambassador to Portugal under George W. Bush. Advertisement Continue reading The revenue-neutral “carbon fee and dividend” idea, as it is sometimes called, has been popular among economists, including conservative ones, for years. It has also been strongly embraced by some leading climate scientists, such as former NASA researcher James Hansen, and such advocacy groups as Citizens’ Climate Lobby. But never before have major Republican statesmen from past administrations aligned behind it as publicly as they’re doing now. Baker and his colleagues estimate that the average family of four would receive $2,000 annually in dividends from the fee if it starts at $40 per ton – hard to see why that wouldn’t be popular – and as the tax rises, so would their dividends. This would naturally create a constituency for ever-tougher climate change action. They also assert that the proposal would be fundamentally progressive, because everyone would receive the same amount of revenue from the tax regardless of their income level, meaning that as a percentage, the new source of income would make much more of a difference for poorer people than for wealthier ones. Finally, they suggest it’s a needed compromise. “We have a regulatory left and a deregulatory right that are far, far apart,” said Mankiw. “Both should acknowledge they’re not going to have control forever.” As soon as the plan was hatched, it got a tweet endorsement from Mitt Romney: “Thought-provoking plan from highly respected conservatives to both strengthen the economy & confront climate risks: http://www.clcouncil.org.” Among Trump administration leaders, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is also familiar with and supportive of a carbon tax, which he championed at ExxonMobil. In general, however, Trump’s Cabinet appointees have been largely noncommittal about the issue of climate change and its human causation, seeming more to try to deflect on the topic than to seek some big idea to break the political logjam over it. Meanwhile, at agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Department, Trump transition teams have brimmed with conservative think tank personas who have a history of questioning the science of climate change and standing up for fossil fuels. Advertisement Continue reading Another problem for taxing carbon, meanwhile, is how it would affect the carbon-intensive coal industry, which Trump spoke out on behalf of during his campaign. Halstead admits coal would fare poorly under the plan — although as the carbon tax rises over time, he noted, it would eventually be beneficial to the economics of carbon capture and storage technology. The new idea is quintessentially conservative, the group argues, because it would not increase the size of government – revenue would go to the public instead of to new government programs – but, by canceling out President Obama’s climate regulatory moves, it would reduce it. “This ticks every one of their boxes, it is pro growth, pro competition, pro jobs, deregulatory, and it will help the working class voters that Trump promised to help,” said Halstead. However, responding to the proposal Wednesday, the Natural Resources Defense Council, a leading environmental group, said it would not support a regulatory rollback in exchange for a carbon tax, underscoring the difficult politics behind the idea. “Putting a price on carbon could be an important part of a comprehensive program. It can’t do the job alone, though, and is not a replacement for carbon limits under our current laws,” said Rhea Suh, the group’s president, in a statement. An even deeper question is whether the current White House is up for big, wonky crossover ideas – especially when recent polling suggests that only a small fraction of Trump voters even believe in human-caused climate change. Still, Baker said, the idea “gives Republicans a seat at the table on an important issue and does so in keeping with Republican principles.” Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe More News Suggested Stories: Obama climate plan to bypass Congress – Jun 25, 2013 Why many economists support Obama's idea of a tax on oil – Feb 8, 2016 The bizarre political fight over Washington state's ballot measure to tax carbon – Nov 7, 2016 Carbon tax push from former GOP officials faces uphill slog – Feb 8, 2017 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

Joe Dontrel Gesse was arrested by Hattiesburg police, Lamar County deputies and constable at an apartment on Shears Road shortly after the incident. “Officers were called to 6072 Highway 98, at Walmart in reference to a shoplifter, and the suspect assaulted the two officers and fled on foot,” Hattiesburg Police Lt. Jon Traxler said.  After the incident, the suspect fled on foot toward a residential area on Shears Road. MOBILE USERS: View photos from the scene here. Hattiesburg officers with the assistance of Lamar County deputies set up a perimeter around an apartment complex on Shears Road, and the suspect was found at 7 Shears Road #2 and taken into custody. “He will be facing several charges pending the outcome of the investigation,” Traxler said.  Neither officer received any serious injuries in the incident, and Gesse was transported by Hattiesburg police to the Forrest County Jail.

RedEye Your weekend plans. Delivered. Business Trump lashes out at Nordstrom in a tweet for dropping his daughter's apparel line What is the ‘Grab Your Wallet’ campaign? The "Grab Your Wallet" campaign is celebrating after Nordstrom said it will stop selling Ivanka Trump clothing and accessories. (Feb. 3, 2017) The "Grab Your Wallet" campaign is celebrating after Nordstrom said it will stop selling Ivanka Trump clothing and accessories. (Feb. 3, 2017) Sarah HalzackThe Washington Post In January, days before President Donald Trump's inauguration, his daughter Ivanka Trump declared that she'd be stepping away from her management role at the clothing and shoe brand that bears her name. And yet, on Wednesday, the president lashed out on Twitter at department store Nordstrom over its decision to stop carrying Ivanka Trump products, saying his daughter "has been treated so unfairly" by the retailing giant. "My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!" The social media missive adds to a cloud of confusion swirling around the Trump administration about how the family's business interests are colliding with Trump's job at the White House. Sean Spicer, Trump's press secretary, defended Trump's tweet to reporters during a briefing Wednesday, saying, "He has every right to stand up for his family and applaud their business activities, their success." Spicer also said, "This is a direct attack on his policies and her name." Nordstrom did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump's tweet, but the company previously said its decision to stop carrying Ivanka Trump goods was based on sales results, not politics. Each year, Nordstrom said in its statement, it prunes about 10 percent of the brands it carries based on performance. It's not clear why Trump believes his daughter was treated unfairly by Nordstrom if she is no longer involved in the label's operations. But his reproach of the company comes as a growing slate of retailers appear to be backing away from the Ivanka Trump brand. Neiman Marcus is no longer carrying fine jewelry from the label on its website, while Belk also no longer features Ivanka Trump clothes and accessories online. A campaign called Grab Your Wallet has been urging shoppers to boycott retailers and other companies connected with the Trump family business empire. It encourages consumers to stay away from retailers that carry Ivanka Trump products as well as businesses such as Trump wineries and golf courses. Trump's adult children have been visible figures in the early days of their father's administration. Ivanka Trump was at the table last week for a gathering of the president's Business Advisory Council, a meeting that was attended by chief executives of corporate behemoths such as Walmart, Pepsi and IBM. Her brothers, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., appeared recently at the event announcing Neil Gorsuch as Trump's pick for an open seat on the Supreme Court. Moves like these have had critics asking how much distance there is between the president and his family's business empire. His sons are running the Trump Organization during his presidency. And while Ivanka has taken a "formal leave of absence" from the Trump Organization, it's not clear that she has relinquished her financial interests in it. Trump has declined to divest his own stake in his business. The president's criticism of Nordstrom exemplifies the uncharted territory that corporate America finds itself in during the Trump era. During his campaign and since his election victory, Trump has not shied away from ripping into specific companies. He has criticized General Motors for making cars overseas, and suggested that an order from Boeing for a new Air Force One jet should be canceled because of its costs. Perhaps as part of an effort to keep out of Trump's crosshairs, big names such as Walmart and Amazon.com have touted their plans for creating thousands of jobs in the United States - catnip for a president who has pledged to be the country's "greatest jobs president." (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) Meanwhile, the fractious political climate has lit the fuse on several consumer boycotts, leaving big companies to try to unravel what these outcries actually mean for their reputations and bottom line. For example, days after Trump signed an executive order that barred refugees and others from seven majority-Muslim nations from coming to the United States, Starbucks announced that it planned to hire 10,000 refugees. On social media, calls quickly bubbled up for consumers to boycott Starbucks. Uber, the ride-hailing company, saw more than 200,000 users delete the app from their phones after a "#DeleteUber" campaign sprang up on social media. It arose after the company said it was dropping its surge pricing during a protest at John F. Kennedy International Airport over Trump's travel ban. And while Grab Your Wallet had encouraged shoppers to boycott Nordstrom for carrying Ivanka Trump apparel, now a new round of boycott talk is simmering that targets the department store chain, this time from shoppers who are outraged with the retailer for dropping the line. The Washington Post's John Wagner contributed.

The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. Among Tom Brady's many amazing feats on Sunday was getting Aaron Rodgers' girlfriend into the game. Olivia Munn, who's been dating the Green Bay Packers' quarterback, starred in Proactiv's first-ever Super Bowl ad, a contingency buy that aired during the overtime spawned by the New England Patriots comeback. The first overtime in Super Bowl history may have seemed totally unexpected. But not by Proactiv, said a spokeswoman in an email: "Proactiv strategically planned to air its branded spot during OT, as they knew it was going to be a close game, and it would be the perfect opportunity to showcase a more brand-focused approach vs. the traditional direct-marketing approach that's historically been the company's focus." A Proactiv spokeswoman did not disclose how much it paid Fox to run the ad, but said the cost of buying the overtime option was less than what it would have been to run an ad during the regulation game. Icon Media Direct handled the buy. The 30-second spot was cut from a 60-second version that had been running elsewhere in recent months. A bilingual version also aired on Fox Deportes during overtime. But neither would have run (such as during postgame) had it not been for the overtime, the spokeswoman said. Student-loan refinancer Sofi, which also had an ad in the game, made a similar overtime option buy for the Super Bowl and "got a great price," a spokesman for the brand said in an email. "You can imagine what our group text thread looked like in the fourth quarter as the game got close!" he said. The ad was made in a week, in-house, using photos and videos members sent during the company's #WhyISoFi contest. It follows the brand's first appearance in the game last year. For more on Fox's overtime windfall check out Ad Age's report from earlier this week. With the Super Bowl over, Valentine's Day marketing is heating up. Zipcar is trying to crank up the passion early by promoting next weekend as"#MAKEorBREAKweekend." According to a survey by the car-sharing marketer, "more than half of Americans ages 18-34 feel that the first day or overnight trip is a good test of a new relationship." So Zipcar says it wants to encourage new couples to "put their relationships to the test with their first day or overnight trips together" and give them the chance to "make it or break it before getting into the potentially messy gray area of Feb. 14." The campaign is getting paid support on Facebook, where Zipcar is posing questions like the one below: Credit: Walker & Co. Meantime, Walker & Co.'s Bevel is launching a digital campaign today in advance of Valentine's Day featuring black gay couples celebrating love. "Valentine's Day is an opportunity to celebrate love," said Cassidy Blackwell, brand marketing lead for Walker & Co. "Our goal at Walker & Co. is to build brands for people of color, which in and of itself is a very diverse community." Besides its original subscription business for men's razors and grooming products, including an electric trimmer launched last year, the brand's expansion into outside retailers has continued with last fall's rollout to Amazon, after the brand moved into Target stores in 2015. Who says you can't innovate around soap? Procter & Gamble Co. has just launched a new "Duos" form for its Olay, Old Spice and Ivory brands, and showering may never be quite the same. Liquid body wash has been edging bar soap out of showers for years. But Duos are something different, neither bar soap nor liquid. Kind of like mushy soap, or Play-Doh. Duos are described by Teen Vogue as a "souped up Scotch-Brite sponge" shaped like a Smucker's Uncrustable with a "cleansing dough" inside. It does away with the need for a loofah or washcloth, with packs containing a 30-day supply of the soapy dough. Credit: Broo.com Men's grooming has been growing in recent years, though not as fast as some marketers would like, particularly in the U.S. as opposed to Europe. A new mashup with a faster-growing category -- craft beer -- can only help. The Broo Craft Beer collection of men's grooming products has made it big time now with a launch into Walmart stores and Walmart.com, Drug Store News reports. Onto food marketing: A new Taco Bell ad looks to get real about morningtime. It kicks off like a typical breakfast product spot, with sunshine streaming through the bedroom window. There's even a jingle. But the guy who wakes up doesn't smell coffee brewing in his kitchen and isn't chipper. He must respond to work emails and deal with the typical morning moments that likely keeps him from eating a full breakfast. While at first the Taco Bell song sounds like a standard relaxing tune, it is not all bright and cheery. "When your morning is hell, just go to Taco Bell," the Mexican fast feeder proclaims in the song, which is also set to run on radio. Chief Marketing Officer Marisa Thalberg said the idea of the latest breakfast ad is one of realistic sincerity. "We're in on this with you, we get it," she said, noting that Taco Bell does not want to create a false representation of modern morning routines, such as sitting down and eating breakfast at the kitchen table in robes. The current spot ends with a mention of the chain's $1 grilled breakfast burrito. The work, from Deutsch, comes three years after the national launch of Taco Bell's breakfast menu. "There's a big group that's really open to it, it's just not top of mind yet," Ms. Thalberg said. "We haven't built a Taco Bell breakfast habit." Restaurants including Panera and Chipotle are not the only brands playing up their use of fresh ingredients. After 2015's "All to the Table" campaign, Stouffer's is now using quick online videos to promote the idea of coming together over frozen lasagna. The campaign from Swift, "It's What's on the Inside that Counts," plays up the packaged food marketer's use of real ingredients by showing real families and friends. According to the Nestle brand, the three stories were unscripted. The people featured are a family in which the father recently returned home from military service; a trio of friends in New York including a married gay couple; and a family in which the wife and husband both work different shifts in an emergency room. The spots are currently running as pre-roll ads and will appear in 30-second versions as well. Plans include running on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and the brand's site, plus additional content made for Pinterest and Twitter. Fiat Chrysler -- which went all-in on its Alfa Romeo brand for Super Bowl -- is going country for its Ram brand. The auto marketer has struck a programming deal with Viacom's CMT network for a March 31 special called "CMT Hometown Heroes." It will feature Chris Stapleton, Darius Rucker and Brett Eldredge "as they make surprise returns to their hometowns to give back and perform for their very own hometown heroes," according to CMT. Turning to financial services: Consumers can look out for a fresh campaign later this year from Fifth Third Bank. The Cincinnati-based regional lender has just tapped Pereira & O'Dell as its creative agency of record. The news follows Fifth Third's recent appointment of Empower MediaMarketing as its media agency of record. The 158-year-old bank, which worked with Leo Burnett on a campaign last year, will reveal new marketing, including TV, radio, digital and out-of-home, in May. Lastly, MillerCoors -- which this week hired Publicis Media to handle media buying and planning -- is sticking with MDC Partners-owned Team Enterprises for experiential marketing and retail sampling.

Home Mail Search News Cricket Movies Lifestyle Celebrity Flickr Mobile Answers More Yahoo Search Search Mail News Home Follow us State Elections 2017 National World Finance Cricket Lifestyle Sports Videos Autos The US is making a big shift away from factory farming Gus Lubin Business Insider8 February 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share chicken farmMore (Flickr/Phil Roeder) The US is quietly making historic progress on farm animal welfare, with ten states and hundreds of brands coming out against the most notorious kinds of factory farming. "You’re seeing almost every major retailer, almost every major fast food producer and restaurant chain committing to phasing out the use of battery cages and/or gestation crates," ASPCA Farm Welfare director Daisy Freund tells Business Insider. "We are going beyond our dreams here, and yet we’re really just getting started." Wins for farm animal welfare in the past few years include: —More than 100 big brands, from Walmart to McDonalds, committing to phasing out battery cages for egg-laying hens over the next 3 to 10 years. —Lots of big brands committing to phasing out gestation crates for pigs. —Big brands including Whole Foods, Aramark, and Compass committing to humane conditions for broiler chickens by 2024. —Ten states banning excessive animal confinement in one form or another, with Massachusetts passing the most comprehensive bill yet in November. —State legislatures repeatedly rejecting "Ag-Gag" or "Right to Farm" bills that prohibit investigations into industrial farms, with the latest example in Oklahoma. —The USDA introducing a new rule mandating better living conditions for organic-certified animal products. These developments could be enough to force changes in the industry. "The market is shifting," says Freund. "[Producers] have to move forward, they have to start adjusting their infrastructure, they have to start investing in cage-free environments at the very least." Changes in the US market could also have global effects, especially when commitments by US brands apply to their international businesses. In many cases, the international markets are already far ahead of the US on farm animal protection. It’s not all good for farm welfare advocates. Indeed, President Donald Trump has some people worried, with Mother Jones warning that his nominee for ambassador to China is in deep with the meat industry and his nominee for head of the EPA is a supporter of Ag-Gag bills; and Forbes warning that Trump could jeopardize the USDA’s new organic rules. Still, the ASPCA is celebrating 2016 as a great year for animal rights and the past few years as good for farm animals in particular. "In the last five years, especially, this has gone from being a fringe issue … to where it is now, where through investigations and media coverage and documentaries and corporate commitments to change, it’s increasingly clear to the American public that what’s happening on factory farms is unacceptable," Freund says. Currently, 99% of US farm animals are raised on factory farms, according to the ASPCA. That number could go down in the coming years, or factory farms themselves could evolve. Because these changes are only beginning, concerned shoppers still need to be careful what they buy. The ASPCA offers a shopping guide and endorses three animal welfare certifications: Animal Welfare Approved, Global Animal Partnership (steps 2 and above), and Certified Humane. (Labels like "Natural" and even "grass-fed" or "cage-free" are often unregulated and unaudited.) Improving conditions for chickens doesn’t take a lot. Getting to step 2 on the Global Animal Partnership, for instance, means providing both cage-free living conditions and enrichments like perches, hay bales, and hanging CDs that reflect the light. "These can seem silly, but they’re extremely important," Freund says. "Chickens are sentient, intelligent creatures, and having interesting objects that they can jump up on or hide behind is not not only good for their own physical health … but also allows them to exercise their natural curiosity and their natural desire to do things like perch, which if denied to them is really a form of cruelty."
