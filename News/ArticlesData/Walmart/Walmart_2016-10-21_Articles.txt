The move is an extension of Wal-Mart's pact with JD.com, China's no. 2 e-commerce site. New Dada, partly owned by JD.com, has more than 25 million registered customers and delivers to more than 300 cities. China is a key growth market for Wal-Mart — potentially lucrative but challenging. The world's largest retailer has increased its stake in JD.com to 10.8 percent, following an initial deal that gave JD.com ownership of its Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian. Wal-Mart said it will be using New Dada's network to offer customers two-hour delivery on groceries ordered from Wal-Mart stores.

(Photo/China Daily) Walmart on Friday announced a million strategic investment in New Dada, China's largest local on-demand logistics and grocery online-to-offline e-commerce platform. The investment is an extension of Walmart's broader agreement with JD.com. As part of the cooperation, New Dada offers customers two-hour delivery on groceries ordered from Walmart stores through the JD Daojia Dada application. The two-hour delivery service is available to customers within a 3 km radius of more than 20 Walmart stores that are currently part of the program. The number of Walmart stores offering two hour delivery is expected to double by the end of the year. New Dada, an independent joint venture of JD.com and Dada, has more than 25 million registered customers and provides local on-demand delivery capabilities, with 2.5 million crowdsourced deliverers across more than 300 cities in China. Walmart has 426 stores in nearly 170 cities. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said: "All around the world, we're creating seamless shopping experiences that bring together our stores, sites and apps to make shopping faster and easier. Our alliance with JD and cooperation with New Dada will provide seamless shopping to millions of customers across China." Philip Kuai, CEO of New Dada, said: "Combining New Dada's delivery network with Walmart stores means consumers will enjoy convenient access to a wide range of high-quality goods delivered to their homes and offices in record time." Fresh food is generally seen as one of the key differentiators in grocery retailing and local retailers. Shopping behaviors of Chinese consumers are rapidly changing in light of the explosive growth of e-commerce and more time spent on leisure and entertainment, said Jason Yu, general manager of Kantar Worldpanel China. At the moment, Walmart offers e-commerce service in a limited number of cities. However, fresh food e-commerce is more challenging because Chinese shoppers are extremely sensitive to freshness and timely delivery as well as prices, he said, noting that's why a number of pure play fresh e-commerce players went bust and more will follow. "The investment in New Dada and JD means that Walmart can significantly expand its shopper reach and leverage the cost efficiency and convenience provided by the New Dada platform," he said. "It is difficult for Walmart alone to make profits on fresh food delivery without sufficient scale." Therefore, the investment-based strategic collaboration makes sense, he said. JD.com formed its partnership with Walmart Stores Inc in June of this year. Walmart sold its e-commerce operation in China to JD.com Inc in exchange for a 5 percent stake in the Chinese e-commerce major.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds subscribe Site Archive Council intitates landscaping and lighting district annexation for Walmart area Saturday Oct 22, 2016 at 12:01 AM Jessica Weston City Editor Jessica_Weston9 The Ridgecrest City Council at their meeting Wednesday initiated proceedings to annex land in and around the Walmart site to a Ridgecrest landscaping and lighting district and to levy and collect annual assessments, beginning in fiscal year 2017-2018. The item was on the consent calendar and pulled for discussion by Mayor Peggy Breeden. Breeden asked about the staff report, which said that the new assessments would not “fund any portion of the flood control facilities irrigation system and planting.” “A lighting and landscaping maintenance district is specifically for lighting and landscaping for the  Walmart project as well as the surrounding properties,” City Engineer Loren Culp said. “It is very specific in what that will allow you to do. That lighting and landscaping district has to be specifically for those uses. It cannot include something with a drainage facility.” Culp reiterated the staff report and said that flood control or drainage facilities would require a Special Benefit Assessment district. Breeden asked who would fund drainage facilities and irrigation systems not covered by the district. “Drainage is not covered by any assessment district, that work will have to be funded by the city,” Culp said. Council candidate Dave Matthews spoke up during public comment, asking if the land is being annexed to the city or “just to a maintenance district?” Culp replied that it is “an annexation to an existing lighting landscaping maintenance district” that was established for a previous project. “Are other properties involved besides Walmart complex and are ballots are going to be sent out to those property owners?” Matthews asked. Culp replied yes and explained the process. “The state requirements are that we have to send out to those properties that are benefiting by the improvements to allow them to agree or disagree to be annexed into the assessment district. “It's in the form of a ballot, which they can protest or decline being involved within the assessment district. Those ballots are taken and if there is a majority of those property owners that agree within that assessment district then we will be able to impose that assessment district on those properties . . . if there is a majority that decide that they do not want to be in this assessment district, then the annexation fails.” Culp said should the majority protest “I think that might be something that the council might consider. It is my understanding that if the majority decides they do not want the assessment district then the . . . the annexation fails.” Total annual maximum assessment for the annexation to be balloted is $42,600.75 and “the total assessment proposed for Fiscal Year 2017/2018 is $36,043.96” if approved, according to the staff report. According to the staff report, if annexation is unsuccessful the city will be responsible for all costs for operation and maintenance. “If annexation is successful Walmart pays O & M costs for the first year,” according to the report, and the city will pay for general benefit expenses of operations and maintenance of $1,239 per year. “City also fronts the O&M cost from the end of the developers one year period until the districts funded approximately January of 2018. The City would be reimbursed for fronting the O&M costs in the January 2018 tax payment,” according to the staff report. Approval of the consent calendar item was unanimous by all five council members.

Mr. Dewan, 40, is the CEO of Arena Holdings Management, an investment business in Cincinnati, Ohio.  Number of households without a bank account dropped in 2015 The number of U.S. households without a bank account dropped sharply in 2015 to 7 percent, according to a biannual survey by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The number of unbanked households fell from 7.7 percent in 2013 and 8.2 percent in 2011. “Developing a relationship with a bank helps consumers build assets and create wealth, makes them less susceptible to discriminatory or predatory lending practices and can provide a financial safety net against unforeseen circumstances,” FDIC chairman Martin Gruenberg said. Bombardier to scrap 7,500 more jobs as CEO deepens cost cuts Bombardier Inc. will cut an additional 7,500 jobs — more than 10 percent of its workforce — over two years as the maker of trains and airplanes accelerates a restructuring plan after taking on billions of dollars of debt to develop its marquee C Series jetliner. Restructuring charges of $225 million to $275 million will be reported as special items starting in the fourth quarter and continuing through 2017, Bombardier said. The Montreal-based company expects the program to yield savings of about $300 million a year by the end of 2018. This is the second major employment cut in eight months by CEO Alain Bellemare, who was hired in February 2015 with a mandate to restore profitability. Wal-Mart invests $50M in China's online grocery business Wal-Mart is investing $50 million in New Dada, China’s largest online grocery and logistics company, as it moves to strengthen its foothold in the nation’s fiercely competitive food market. The move is an extension of Wal-Mart’s pact with JD.com, China’s no. 2 e-commerce site. New Dada, partly owned by JD.com, has more than 25 million registered customers and delivers to more than 300 cities. China is a key growth market for Wal-Mart — potentially lucrative but challenging. The world’s largest retailer has increased its stake in JD.com to 10.8 percent, following an initial deal that gave JD.com ownership of its Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian. Wal-Mart said earlier this week it will be using New Dada’s network to offer customers two-hour delivery on groceries ordered from Wal-Mart stores. Tesla may enter ride ride-hailing business next year Electric car maker Tesla Motors has plans to get into the ride-hailing and sharing businesses. The company hinted at the venture earlier this week when it announced that all of its cars would come equipped with hardware needed to drive themselves. The company says in a disclaimer that use of self-driving Teslas to make money with ride-hailing or sharing will be allowed only on Tesla’s own network. Details will be released next year. A message left for a Tesla spokeswoman was not immediately answered on Friday. BAT bids $47 billion for full ownership of Reynolds American British American Tobacco Plc offered to pay $47 billion for full control of Reynolds American Inc., proposing a trans-Atlantic deal that would create the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company and put brands such as Lucky Strike and Camel under the same roof. The unsolicited cash-and-stock offer of $56.50 a share would allow London-based BAT to acquire the 58 percent of Reynolds that it doesn’t already own. But the U.K. company only plans to pursue the transaction with the support of Reynolds. The two sides haven’t yet held negotiations, BAT said, and the Reynolds’s board is just now reviewing the offer.  Sign up for free newsletters and get more of the Post-Gazette delivered to your inbox Most Read Most Emailed Advertisement Most Commented Join the conversation: Commenting policy | How to report abuse To report inappropriate comments, abuse and/or repeat offenders, please send an email to socialmedia@post-gazette.com and include a link to the article and a copy of the comment.

Thinkstock By Bob Niedt, Online Editor Originally published October 21, 2016 It’s only October, but the eyes of retailers and bargain-hunters are trained on late November, when the holiday shopping season launches in earnest on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving. Stores are already starting to stock, organize and get ready to advertise Black Friday doorbusters and deals. SEE ALSO: 8 Things You Should Never Keep In Your Wallet Retailers are also hoping for a solid uptick in sales, which is looking likely. The National Retail Federation forecasts holiday-season sales in November and December will jump 3.6% over 2015, to $655.8 billion. Online sales are projected to increase between 7% and 10% over last year to as much as $117 billion. Thinking about doing your holiday shopping Thanksgiving week? Here’s the early edition forecast of what to expect for Black Friday 2016. Don’t Jump the Gun Many retailers are already rolling out displays and sales. I’ve seen holiday merchandise at BJ’s Wholesale, Costco, Lowe’s and Walmart. At this point, much of it is centered around décor: outdoor and indoor lights, artificial Christmas trees and the like. Hold your horses for the real deals in gifting, though. Advertisement “Store will advertise ‘early Black Friday’ deals in early November, but that's just a marketing ploy,” says Benjamin Glaser of deals website DealNews.com. “The really good discounts start the Monday before Black Friday.” If you’re marking your calendar, that’s November 21. Keep an Eye on Walmart and Target Deals experts keep a tight watch on Walmart and Target for hints of the direction holiday shopping is headed and the hot products the two will be touting. SEE ALSO: Reasons to Shop at Walmart, Even If You Hate Walmart If Walmart sticks to its pattern from recent years, expect to see its Black Friday ad land on or around Nov. 10, about two weeks before Black Friday. (Insider tip: The ad first rolled out in 2015 on Walmart’s mobile app before it went online or in print.) Walmart called last year’s game plan for select doorbuster items a success – so it will likely be implemented again in 2016. That includes the 1-hour guarantee: Shoppers who lined up an hour before stores opened were guaranteed to get select doorbuster merchandise on sale – even if that store ran out of its stock. Target’s Black Friday ad is one of the most eagerly awaited of the season, according to deals websites. Shoppers look for the best bargains and competing retailers seek out what they’re going to match – or undercut – on price. Last year, Target’s ad topped out at 40 pages, up from 32 in 2014. Advertisement Brace for the Thanksgiving Revolt After seeing increasingly more stores and shopping centers move up the start of Black Friday shopping to Thanksgiving Day, there seems to be a retrenching this year. There’s a growing list of retailers vowing to keep brick-and-mortar stores dark on Thanksgiving (online is always 24/7, of course). Minnesota’s massive Mall of America, for one, will be closed on Thanksgiving Day for the first time in years. So too will the Barnes & Noble, BJ’s Wholesale Club, Costco, Lowe’s, H&M, Nordstrom, Sam’s Club, T.J. Maxx and GameStop chains. As a journalist, I’ve followed the retail scene since 1992. I’ve worked several Thanksgivings covering the growing number of retailers who propped open their doors on the holiday. And I covered the people who shopped those days, as well as the ones who brayed at Retail America for stepping on an important family tradition. Whichever side you fall on, if you plan to shop during Thanksgiving week this year, plan accordingly. TVs Will Take Center Stage It’s a truism of Black Friday that televisions will lead the way in electronics deals. That’s because many retailers drastically discount doorbuster TVs in order to get shoppers excited – and inside stores. It will be no different this year. On Black Friday, DealNews projects some retailers will be offloading 65-inch 4K TVs at doorbuster prices. Look for the super-high-resolution models – 4K TVs have four times the resolutions of traditional HD sets – for around $459, down from the average price of $1,025.

Comments By Lucas Mearian Follow Computerworld | Oct 21, 2016 12:32 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Sustainable IT Computer Hardware Comments Target has surpassed perennial champion Walmart as the U.S.'s top corporate user of solar power, according to a new report. Target has installed 147 megawatts (million watts or MW) of solar capacity on 300 stores, according to the 2016 Solar Means Business Report from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). "We're incredibly proud of the progress we've made in improving building efficiencies and reducing environmental impact. Our commitment to installing solar panels on 500 stores and distribution centers by 2020 is evidence of that progress," John Leisen, vice president of property management at Target, said in the SEIA statement. Walmart had held the top spot for the previous four years and still claims second place with 145MW of solar power installed on 364 buildings, according to the SEIA, which has been tracking corporate solar deployments for the past five years. This year, real estate developer Prologis came in third with 107.8MW of solar. Apple, which is in fourth place with 93.9MW of installed solar power, is a likely contender for first place sometime next year. Last year, Apple announced it was investing $850 million in a solar power plant through a partnership with First Solar, one of the nation's largest photovoltaic (PV) manufacturers and provider of utility-scale PV plants. Through a 25-year purchasing agreement, Apple will get 130MW from the new California Flats Solar Project. The project is currently under construction and is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Other Top 10 companies recognized in the SEIA's report include Costco (50.7 MW), Kohl's (50.2 MW), IKEA (44 MW), Macy's (38.9 MW), General Growth Properties (30.2 MW) and Hartz Mountain Industries (22.7 MW). While IKEA is in seventh place, it powers 91% of its retail locations through solar, according to the SEIA. Overall, U.S. corporations have doubled their solar installations year over year and are expected to close out 2016 with nearly 280MW of solar power -- compared to 130MW in 2015. The SEIA's report covers corporate solar installations in 38 states plus Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico; it tracks almost 1,100MW of solar installations at 2,000 U.S. companies. "To put that in context, that's enough electricity to power the equivalent of 193,000 homes every year," the report stated. "Also noteworthy, in just the first three quarters of 2016, the report found 142MW of corporate solar was added in the U.S., more than was installed in all of 2015 (129 MW)." In 2014, frustrated by a lack of renewable energy and a purchasing system that's too complicated, major U.S. companies joined an initiative to force the government and utilities to change. Along with the World Wildlife Fund and the World Resources Institute, the corporations signed a pact supporting six principles to clearly identify what's needed when purchasing renewable energy. The initial companies included Bloomberg, Facebook, General Motors, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, Mars, Novelis, Procter and Gamble, REI, Sprint and Walmart. The companies called for six specific changes they wanted the energy industry to adopt to increase renewable energy use: Greater choice in procurement options More access to cost competitive options Longer- and variable-term contracts Access to new projects that reduce emissions Streamlined third-party financing Increased purchasing options with utilities "Solar plays a vital role within our renewable energy portfolio," Mark Vanderhelm, vice president of energy for Walmart, said in a statement. "This is evident by our 2020 commitment of doubling solar energy projects at our Walmart stores, Sam's Clubs and distribution centers across the nation. Our focus is on finding those solar projects that are right for the business."

That includes two-hour delivery services at some Walmart stores and a Walmart global store on JD Worldwide, JD.com’s cross-border platform. Walmart bought an initial stake in JD.com, China’s No. 2 e-commerce site, this year in a deal that gave JD.com ownership of its Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian. This month, Walmart increased its stake in JD.com to 10.8 percent from 5.9 percent. The world’s largest retailer is trying to improve its business in China, the globe’s most populous country that is lucrative but challenging. In China, Walmart faces a business that has been slow and uneven. Singles Day was launched by Chinese college students in the 1990s as a version of Valentine’s Day for people without romantic partners. The Nov. 11 timing was based on the four singles of 11.11. Unattached young people would treat each other to dinner or bestow gifts to woo someone and end their single status. It became a shopping bonanza as sellers of everything from necklaces to TVs moved to cash in on the marketing opportunity, and it is now China’s answer to Cyber Monday in the United States.

Back in the day I’d go to Circuit City and walk out with one of the mid-range Cobra or Whistler models that would run between $100-$150 and they seemed to work well. Over the years many of the local brick and mortar electronic stores went out of business, but luckily the local Walmart always had multiple Cobra brand radar detectors in-stock. The last one I purchased was the Cobra SPX7700 from Walmart in late 2014 and it was by far the worst radar detector that I had ever used, let alone purchased. My particular Cobra SPX7700 would constantly have false alarms at the highest level every few minutes and then fail to detect pretty much every police car that was doing radar. That one purchase ruined my long running faith in radar detectors and was tossed in the closet while I drove around with no radar detector for the first time in my life. Sure Cobra is considered a lower tier brand that was recently bought out by Escort, but not everyone wants to spend over $200 on a radar detector. The silence was nice, but having a radar detector does give you peace of mind and that was missing during spirited driving. I later learned that many of the false alerts might have due to new car technologies that are wreaking havoc on lower-end radar detectors. Cars like the Audi Q7 or Mercedes-Benz E-Class use radar-based safety features when their active cruise control is engaged and that is picked up by many radar detectors that aren’t filtering those signals. Most car manufactures now offer some form of collision avoidance or active cruise control and rely on lasers to detect the presence of other vehicles. Most radar detectors can’t separate the ‘noise’ from all these new technology packages on vehicles, but manufactures have been ‘fine-tuning’ their solutions to do a better job at it. The vehicle safety systems rely on radar receivers operating at the same short-range 24 GHz frequency bandwidth as police K-band radar guns. Radar detectors are designed to scan the 24.050 – 24.250 GHz bandwidth to report the use of police radar. That’s where the false positives come from  unless the radar detector manufacturer offers a specific filtering technology to address this. When Legit Reviews was approached by K40 Electronics to do a review on one of their radar detectors we were intrigued. K40 claims to have ‘the most advanced radar detector and laser jamming system in the world’ on a  fully-integrated 360º radar protection solution called the K40 RL360i. A full car installation wasn’t something we were interested in, but K40 does make a couple portable radar detectors. There is the K40 RLS2 all-band radar and laser detector with GPS technology ($299.99 shipped) and the K40 RD950 Radar and Laser Detector ($249.99) that doesn’t have GPS connectivity and fewer bells and whistles. Both have advanced K-Band filtering to help eliminate false alerts from OEM radar-based accessories (adaptive cruise control or lane departure warning systems).  The use of GPS technology allows The K40 RLS2 to offer four programmable settings to ensure you remain focused on real threats: Mark to Mute – Silence regularly encountered non-police radar locations. Mark to Alert – Mark speed traps, cameras, school zones, and any other location of particular interest. Quiet Ride – Silence warnings under a pre-selected speed (default is 5 mph). Great for mall areas as well as long highway speed road trips. Speed Monitor – Alerts if selected speed is exceeded. Good reminder for teen drivers! The model that we will be taking a look at today is the K40 RLS2 Portable Radar Detector (product page), which is the flagship portable model made by K40 Electronics. Priced at $299.99 with free shipping on Amazon, we’d classify this model as being an upper mid-tier model. K40 RLS2 Protection Features: Detects all North American-approved police radar bands GPS-based “Mark to Alert” and “Mark to Mute” allow you to mark specific threats and to filter specific locations three selectable modes for highway or city driving digital voice and audio tone alerts for radar, laser, and POP K-band filter rejects alerts from vehicles with radar-based safety systems traffic sensor filter allows filtration of K-band traffic flow sensors display includes signal strength meter dim and mute modes Three Filter Settings: Level/Mode Sensitivity Recommended Use 1. Highway Detects all North American police radar (X, K, and Ka-Band) and laser signals at full sensitivity. For highway travel or in any area in which you are unfamiliar with the types of radar used. 2. City 50% reduction in X-band sensitivity. This is because it is the most common source of non-police radar signals. K, Ka, and Laser will remain at full sensitivity. When traveling in an urban area with minimal non-police radar signals. 3. Filter Eliminates X-Band detection completely. Reduces K and Ka-Band sensitivity by 50%. Laser detection will remain at full sensitivity. When traveling in a congested traffic area with a high concentration of non-police radar signals.   K40 RLS2 Radar Detector Retail Box The retail packing for the K40 RLS2 Radar Detector is fairly simple with a ‘Drive Ticket-Free’ logo on the front edge of the box. If you get a speeding ticket (except in school or construction zones and/or due to a DUI or DWI violation) K40 electronics will reimburse you for the ticket. Simply send them a copy of the radar or laser speeding ticket, your proof of payment of the ticket, and your receipt for your K40 purchase. K40 Electronics also backs their products with a 100% performance guarantee that allows you to return it within 30 days if it doesn’t meet your expectations and if you want to keep it there is a one-year warranty that covers any repair or replacements of a defective product. K40 Electronics has without a doubt one of the best ownership guarantees around. Update 10/22/2016: After posting this review K40 electronics contacted us and also posted a statement in the comment section in this review saying that they will not honor any warranties, guarantees, and/or services for K40 products purchased from most all online stores. Basically they are 100% supporting their Authorized Dealer network. In St. Louis there are only six K40 dealers in a 100 mile radius, so if you live in a rural are you’ll likely have to drive to a major city and pay more to get a warranty and any guarantees. We called a couple of the St. Louis distributors only to find them closed on the weekend and will update when we find out what local pricing is.  K40 RLS2 Radar Detector Accessories Inside the packaging you’ll find the RLS2 portable radar detector, mounting bracket, suction cups, hard wired power adapter cord, coiled power adapter cord, extra fuses for each power adapter and the typical paperwork. It was a bit odd that the cigarette lighter power adapters used different fuses, but it is certainly nice to have the option of two cables. We wish the K40 RLS2 came with an extra set of suction cups as those always fail 1-2 years down the road any they are not the standard sizes you’ll find at a local Walmart or Home Depot type big box retail stores. The K40 RLS2 utilizes a simple dot matrix display that is easy to read during the day or night and you do have the ability to adjust the brightness levels. This model has seven buttons on the top: MARK Button: Press and hold to mark specific locations for alert. Press and release to mute specific radar / laser alerts in a location. QUIET Ride Button: Press and release to confirm speed setting and enter Quiet Ride menu MUTE Button: Press and release to mute audio for 30 seconds or the duration of the alert. Press and hold for 3 seconds to engage a 5-minute mute. UP & Down Buttons: Navigation in MENU mode Filter Button: Press and release to select level of alert sensitivity DIM / MENU Button: Press and release to adjust display brightness, or hold for 3 seconds to enter MENU mode. When it comes to programmable features there are 15 to select from and rather than explaining them all we scanned in a copy of the RLS2 quick reference guide that comes with the radar detector that you can keep in the car if you want. On the side of the K40 RLS2 you have the power port and the volume wheel. We were a bit shocked to learn that there was no USB port, WiFi or Bluetooth functionality with the K40 RLS2. This means that the firmware isn’t upgradeable. We asked K40 Electronics about why they made this design decision and you can read the response below. The firmware isn’t upgradeable and doesn’t need to be upgraded as we don’t maintain any kind of database of locations. To us, we give the driver the power to control/select such via GPS marking instead of having to constantly update to get the latest information. – K40 Electronics The screen is easy to read and below you can see what it looks like when you the RLS2 picks up a Ka-band signal. The RLS2 shows the type of band detected on the left, the strength of that band in the middle and then your speed in either mph or kph. The radar signal strength ranges from 1 being the low to 9 being the highest. The real test of any radar detector is actually using it. I’ve been using the K40 RLS2 radar detector daily in St. Louis, Missouri and have been more than impressed. As I mentioned in the introduction, I’ve been a long time user of Cobra radar detectors up until all the cars with collision avoidance technologies became wildly popular in the past year. All the false alerts were so annoying it drove me to not use a radar detector at all. The K40 RLS2 has very good K-Band filtering and I’ve actually gone for short 10-20 mile trips around the metro area on the highway with no false alarms whatsoever. In fact, the K40 RLS2 was so quite that I was worried it wasn’t working properly the first few days that I was using it. Finally, after several days of seeing no police doing radar I finally got to see it in action and 99% of the time it detects the radar signal well before I see the police car. On previous detectors there were times where you’d see the car on the side of the road ahead and then the radar detector starts going off. That is not the case with the K40 RLS2 unless they are doing spot radar and then there is nothing you can do about that. I’m also very impressed with how well it detects cross-street radar when the officer is doing radar along a main road from a side street. Many local police do that around my home and the K40 RLS2 does a very good job picking that up before I get there even when there are no cars ahead of me to reflect the signal. The Quiet Ride and other GPS features make $50 price premium on the RLS2 over the RD950 worth it in my opinion. Before using the K40 RLS2 there is no way I’d ever spend $300 on a radar detector as the lower cost models worked and got me by. After using a higher-end model like the K40 RLS2 it showed me what I was missing and that was a quality detector that didn’t have a zillion false alarms. It almost makes me wonder what the top-dollar models perform like as the Valentine One Radar Detector runs $499.98 and the Escort Max 360 Radar Detector demands $595.00. The K40 RLS2 is currently priced available for $299.99 with free shipping on Amazon (MSRP $399.95). It may not have all the features that the competitors have, but it has solid range performance and it is night and day better than the lower cost models that you can pick up at local brick and mortar stores. Legit Bottom Line: K40 Electronics might not be the first brand that comes to mind when you think about radar detectors, but the K40 RLS2 was found to be a solid performer that worked as advertised.

Overall, U.S. corporations have doubled their solar installations year over year and are expected to close out 2016 with nearly 280MW of solar power -- compared to 130MW in 2015. The SEIA's report covers corporate solar installations in 38 states plus Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico; it tracks almost 1,100MW of solar installations at 2,000 U.S. companies. "To put that in context, that's enough electricity to power the equivalent of 193,000 homes every year," the report stated. "Also noteworthy, in just the first three quarters of 2016, the report found 142MW of corporate solar was added in the U.S., more than was installed in all of 2015 (129 MW)." In 2014, frustrated by a lack of renewable energy and a purchasing system that's too complicated, major U.S. companies joined an initiative to force the government and utilities to change. Along with the World Wildlife Fund and the World Resources Institute, the corporations signed a pact supporting six principles to clearly identify what's needed when purchasing renewable energy. The initial companies included Bloomberg, Facebook, General Motors, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, Mars, Novelis, Procter and Gamble, REI, Sprint and Walmart. The companies called for six specific changes they wanted the energy industry to adopt to increase renewable energy use: Greater choice in procurement options More access to cost competitive options Longer- and variable-term contracts Access to new projects that reduce emissions Streamlined third-party financing Increased purchasing options with utilities "Solar plays a vital role within our renewable energy portfolio," Mark Vanderhelm, vice president of energy for Walmart, said in a statement. "This is evident by our 2020 commitment of doubling solar energy projects at our Walmart stores, Sam's Clubs and distribution centers across the nation. Our focus is on finding those solar projects that are right for the business."

Most Popular For years, Walmart has followed Amazon, putting inventory online and starting its own version of a marketplace where third-party merchants can sell their wares. Now Amazon is returning the favor. The e-commerce behemoth is building pickup locations for groceries in Seattle that could open by the end of the year, according to someone familiar with the plans, echoing a strategy embraced by its chief brick-and-mortar rival. Delivering fresh food is complicated and the one thing keeping Amazon and other tech companies from disrupting the grocery business. Most consumers still get their milk, produce and meat from Walmart, Kroger and other traditional grocers. But while e-commerce has yet to take hold in the $800 billion U.S. grocery market, Amazon is betting that could change as millennials accustomed to shopping online enter their prime food-buying years. "We know their best customers are willing to buy groceries online," says Cowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge. "The onus is on Amazon to deliver because the demand is there." Amazon began experimenting with the grocery business in 2007 when the company started AmazonFresh in the Seattle area, where the company is based. The service offered doorstep delivery of a limited selection of groceries, saving consumers driving time and the trouble of pushing a shopping cart around a store. The service has slowly expanded to 16 U.S. markets, including Los Angeles, New York and Boston. In June, the company rolled out the service to Prime subscribers in London, the first time it has been offered outside the U.S. Amazon currently offers same-day delivery of more than 130,000 items for 7 pounds ($8.58) per month on top of the cost of Prime. Recently AmazonFresh hit a milestone when it stopped losing money in Seattle, according to the person. Earlier this month, the company dropped the price from $299 a year to $15 a month in the U.S. -- $180 annually -- which proved immediately popular with shoppers and emboldened Amazon to accelerate its grocery ambitions, the person said. Delivering groceries to a customer's home is an expensive and tricky proposition because fresh food spoils and can't be left at the door like electronics or clothing. It has taken Peapod, the grocery delivery service owned by Royal Ahold, years to figure out how to deliver meat and produce profitably. Instacart, a San Francisco upstart that has partnered with Whole Foods, employs legions of shoppers who troll the aisles and deliver food to customers' homes. It, too, has struggled to crack the code. Walmart and Kroger have embraced the so-called click-and-collect model. Shoppers select their food online, and then workers fill the order and have it ready for pickup in the store parking lot. Besides side-stepping potential spoilage, Walmart is hoping that shoppers will buy other things once they've made it as far as the parking lot. The service has only been around for a few years and is still rolling out nationally, so it's too early to judge its popularity among the targeted demo of millennial mothers. Amazon, of course, doesn't have much of a physical presence in the U.S. beyond a few bookstores. So the company is turning to pickup locations for its groceries. In Seattle, Amazon is building facilities that resemble gas stations, where shoppers could pull in and pick up their groceries. Seattle Planning Department documents reveal two similar projects in the city featuring car canopies. One of the sites is near a new Amazon Prime Now distribution hub where shoppers pick up packages ordered through the company's one-hour delivery service, according to another person familiar with the matter. Construction crews were busy at both locations earlier this week. The company declined to comment. Amazon could also team up with local grocers to offer grocery pickup sites allowing it to expand the concept more quickly than it could by building new locations around the country, according to another person briefed on the plans. In the U.K., Amazon has pickup lockers at stores operated by the Morrisons supermarket chain where shoppers can pick up online orders. Under such partnerships, Amazon can also put the grocers' inventory on its site. Meanwhile, Amazon is testing the appetite for grocery delivery among Prime subscribers who don't pay extra for AmazonFresh. Prime members in Southern California and Indianapolis, for instance, can get fresh food delivered from Bristol Farms and Fresh Thyme Farmers Market, via the Prime Now quick delivery service. Further grocer partnerships lets Amazon feel out new markets while competing with Whole Foods-Instacart. Ultimately, Amazon could integrate the Fresh and Prime Now services into one, one of the people said. Amazon's push into fresh food is a direct threat to the established players. In the U.K., the company has entered a crowded market where Tesco Plc and web grocer Ocado Group Plc have been engaged in a price war for years. Ocado shares plummeted when Amazon announced its U.K. plans. In the U.S., the main tussle will play out between Amazon and Wal-Mart, which is the nation's largest grocer, generates more than half its sales from selling food and uses cheap food to lure customers to its stores. Time and again, Amazon has shown itself willing to absorb losses while it builds a commanding market share. In groceries, the company is willing to break even in an effort to persuade shoppers to visit the site more often, one of the people said. The big question is whether sizable numbers of Americans will be prepared to purchase fresh food online, sight unseen. For many people, there's no substitute for personally assessing the ripeness of an avocado or the thickness of a steak. Wal-Mart and other traditional grocers are spending billions to improve the shopping experience and doubling down on prepared meals and private label products you can't get anywhere else. "There's still going to be a place for stores that have a good selection and provide that experience," says industry consultant Roger Davidson. Still, many experts said shoppers wouldn't buy furniture or cars online. Turns out they will, and Amazon is betting the same will be true of fresh food. ~~ Bloomberg News In this article: Beverages CMO Strategy Creativity Digital Packaged Food Shopper Marketing Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2016 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17 x Scroll to Continue

Target has installed 147 megawatts (million watts or MW) of solar capacity on 300 stores, according to the 2016 Solar Means Business Report from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). "We're incredibly proud of the progress we've made in improving building efficiencies and reducing environmental impact. Our commitment to installing solar panels on 500 stores and distribution centers by 2020 is evidence of that progress," John Leisen, vice president of property management at Target, said in the SEIA statement. Walmart had held the top spot for the previous four years and still claims second place with 145MW of solar power installed on 364 buildings, according to the SEIA, which has been tracking corporate solar deployments for the past five years. This year, real estate developer Prologis came in third with 107.8MW of solar. Apple, which is in fourth place with 93.9MW of installed solar power, is a likely contender for first place sometime next year. Last year, Apple announced it was investing $850 million in a solar power plant through a partnership with First Solar, one of the nation's largest photovoltaic (PV) manufacturers and provider of utility-scale PV plants. Through a 25-year purchasing agreement, Apple will get 130MW from the new California Flats Solar Project. The project is currently under construction and is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Other Top 10 companies recognized in the SEIA's report include Costco (50.7 MW), Kohl's (50.2 MW), IKEA (44 MW), Macy's (38.9 MW), General Growth Properties (30.2 MW) and Hartz Mountain Industries (22.7 MW). While IKEA is in seventh place, it powers 91% of its retail locations through solar, according to the SEIA.

The investment in New Dada, which is part-owned by JD.com, would also deepen collaboration between Wal-Mart and JD.com. Wal-Mart earlier this year sold its subsidiary, Shanghai-based online retailer Yihaodian, for a minority stake in JD.com. “We look forward to deepening our cooperation with Wal-Mart as China’s O2O (online-to-offline) retail industry continues to evolve and grow,” said Philip Kuai, CEO of New Dada. Earlier this week, Wal-Mart, which has 426 stores in nearly 170 Chinese cities, said it would launch exclusive Sam’s Club and Global Imports stores on JD.com and a two-hour grocery delivery service for orders placed on JD.com dispatched by New Dada.

The organization received a grant from the Walmart Foundation of $92,000, allowing for the purchase of two new food delivery vehicles, called "hot shots", which have heated and refrigerated compartments. By DAILY CHRONICLE- news@daily-chronicle.com SYCAMORE – Voluntary Action Center is a step closer to expanding its meal delivery programs thanks to a $92,000 grant from the Walmart Foundation. VAC unveiled two new “hot shot” vehicles at a ceremony Thursday at its Sycamore facility, 1606 Bethany Road. The food delivery vehicles are equipped with hot and cold compartments to ensure proper temperature regulation for food transported as part of VAC’s Meals on Wheels program. A grant from the Walmart Foundation’s State Giving Program was used to buy the vehicles. “Meals on Wheels continues to a good service to seniors and others who cannot prepare their own meals,” DeKalb Mayor John Rey said. “Citizens receive benefit from Walmart partnering with this generous support.” Rey said the donation underscored the importance of public-private partnerships. The vehicles allow VAC to replace part of its aging fleet of vehicles and expand meal delivery service to rural areas that previously were too far away for safe delivery, according to a news release. In addition to food service for the Meals on Wheels program, VAC plans to use the vehicles to serve meals to students during the summer as part of the free and reduced lunch program. VAC serves meals to several sites in DeKalb County, including Camp Power in University Village, as part of that effort, VAC Executive Director Ellen Rogers said. Voluntary Action Center, a nonprofit organization, provides transportation and nutritional services in DeKalb, LaSalle, Putnam, Bureau and Kendall counties. Rogers said the Meals on Wheels program would be expanded once the state starts paying it bills and service cuts have been restored. “At the Walmart Foundation, we know how important it is to have access to healthy, affordable food,” said Jim Haager, manager of the Rochelle Walmart store. “We’re proud to support VAC and their efforts to help the residents of DeKalb, LaSalle, Putnam, Bureau counties live better.” Related Links Marlyn Burkart, founder of Marlyn’s Majorettes, dies Propane storage facility plans up for another vote Sycamore library board picks new leader 4-day volunteer event kicks off for Feed My Starving Children Sycamore adds stop sign, parking restrictions downtown Sycamore City Council to review budget adjustments Get breaking and town-specific news sent to your phone.

Published Oct 20th, 2016 8:46 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Wal-Mart Stores and its strategic partner JD.com in China outlined a new game plan Thursday (Oct. 20) to expand access to more products in hopes of growing share against chief online competitor Alibaba. It comes on the heels of the Bentonville-based global retailer recently raising its stake in JD.com to 10.8%, and ahead of the Chinese holiday Singles’ Day (Nov. 11), which is one of biggest online shopping days of the year. “Today’s news is the culmination of months of hard work and collaboration with the JD team. Our new services will leverage our combined strengths to give Chinese consumers access to quality products from around the world,” Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon said in the statement. Wal-Mart is establishing a flagship Sam’s Club store on JD.com that will launch Friday. The site will provide consumers access to Sam’s Club products – largely imports and higher valued items – that can be delivered same or next-day as with JD’s typical service. With this play, Wal-Mart is leveraging JD.com’s nationwide logistics network with merchandise stocked in Sam’s Club merchandise in JD’s warehouses. With this initiative Wal-Mart is able to reach more consumers seeking imported goods which are typically sold only in physical clubs. Sam’s Club is one of the hottest formats in China, according to Walmart International CEO David Cheesewright. He told the media in June that the first question he gets when talking with Chinese officials in specific towns is when they will get a Sam’s Club. Walmart International plans to build 20 more Sam’s Clubs by 2019, but in the meantime, Chinese consumers will access Sam’s Club’s flagship store online. To kick off this launch Wal-Mart said all JD.com users will be able to buy Sam’s Club products at membership prices during a 10-day introduction period following the launch. Annibal Sodero, a supply chain and e-commerce expert at the University of Arkansas, said this is a smart strategy by Wal-Mart because it allows them to leverage physical assets while also appealing to a new consumer demographic that has more money to spend. He said the Club format in China is the most unexplored and Wal-Mart has an advantage in this area. Wal-Mart announced its partnership with JD in June as a a way to grow it footprint in China. “Walmart is getting this right. It’s good to see them leveraging their assets with JD’s expertise in delivery,” Sodero said. “Alibaba has had a huge advantage over Walmart in China in the past because it’s close to where most of the products come from. This new initiative by Walmart will put them head-on with Alibaba in that sense.” Wal-Mart also plans to launch a Walmart Global Imports Store on JD.com that provides a variety of imports from around the world, giving Chinese consumers more options to buy products from outside their homeland. Wal-Mart is relying on JD’s last mile logistics network that will deliver to customers through a speedy home delivery service. Sodero said Amazon has invested in a fulfillment center behind the Empire State Building in Manhattan, some of the most expensive real estate in the nation, and did so to be able to offer immediate delivery in New York City for which it charges Prime members $8. If they are willing to wait two hours, it’s free. Sodero said JD has that same kind of logistic infrastructure in China and Wal-Mart being able to leverage it is a big move, and fits with the third strategy outlined by Wal-Mart. The retailer said it will use 20 of its physical stores to fulfill online grocery and fresh food orders for customers on the new site JD Daojia, a joint venture between crowd-sourced logistics firm New Dada and JD.com. The service will provide two-hour delivery in limited cities. Wal-Mart said it plans to double the store fulfillment capacity by the end of the year. “Walmart and JD.com share a vision of providing consumers the best products, quality and service, at highly competitive prices,” JD.com CEO Richard Liu said in a statement. “The three areas of cooperation that we are launching exemplify the rapid pace with which our strategic alliance with Walmart is progressing. Combining the strengths of Walmart, as the world’s largest retailer, and JD’s unparalleled same-day delivery network and reputation for authentic products is a potent force for providing Chinese consumers the best shopping experience.” Wal-Mart said such initiatives will expand the number of products available to Chinese consumers, as well as the number of consumers who have access to some of the products already in the Chinese market. “Walmart is playing offense here and they are headed in the right direction with these moves as I see it. The partnership with JD is quite strategic. This is a very good petri dish (experiment) in the largest market in the world for e-commerce. Walmart can learn a lot here. They will learn how to play locally against Alibaba but more importantly they can apply those learnings in other markets to be springboard of growth,” Sodero said. However, Sodero cautioned that it’s not always easy for a juggernaut like Wal-Mart to partner, but he said the two companies appear to be aligned in strategy. He said there will be some mistakes and there are risks, but Wal-Mart has no choice to but to try and figure out the Chinese market. “Walmart has to grow internationally for the long term because the U.S. growth is limited. This looks like a consistent and solid strategy,” he added. “The are moving ahead quickly with JD.” Author Bio: See latest posts Comments 3shares Talk Business & Politics by email Arkansas headlines delivered to you on demand Email address Statewide Newsletter Northeast Arkansas Newsletter Fort Smith Newsletter Northwest Arkansas Newsletter Submit Opinion Ruth Whitney Volunteering should be part of the business plan Michael Tilley Riff Raff: A Veterans Day remembrance Justin Allen Marijuana and the constitutionality of ‘Shall means shall’ Randy Zook Issue 3 will mean jobs for Arkansas Michael Tilley Riff Raff: 3 concerns with Issue 3 Special Sections Home Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Magazine Opinion © 2015 Talk Business & Politics.

Walmart opens training academy in Williamstown Celeste E. Whittaker, @cp_CWhittaker 10:22 p.m. EDT October 20, 2016 Walmart regional manager Thomas Underwood (right in suit) and others cut the ribbon as they celebrate the grand opening of the training academy at the Walmart store in Williamstown on South Blackhorse Pike. The training academy is the retail giant's first in New Jersey and will be among 200 across the country. There were 50 hourly supervisors and department managers that graduated from the academy on Thursday morning. (Photo: Photo provided) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE WILLIAMSTOWN – Holly Ford is proud to say she’s a graduate now. Ford was one of 50 Walmart employees who graduated Thursday morning from a new training academy inside the Walmart store here. The New Gretna native, who is a department manager in the lawn and garden section, has worked at Walmart for 22 years, the last five at the Williamstown store. She makes the hour-long commute each day from Burlington County. “It was very exciting,” said Ford, who got to wear a cap and gown. “I never graduated high school, so to do this, it was like amazing. I never thought it would happen ever. I was excited. I was so proud. This is an amazing program, it really is, and everybody just needs to give it a chance. When you go in with an open mind, you have that chance. The training academy inside the Walmart at 1840 South Black Horse Pike is the first in the state and one of four planned for the region. Two more are planned for North Jersey and one for New York. The retail giant, which is also celebrating its 25th year of operations in New Jersey, plans to open 200 training academies across the country, which are all scheduled to open by the end of 2017. Walmart opened its first New Jersey store in Turnersville in 1991 and now has more than 70 locations throughout the state with more than 20,000 employees. The company’s plan is for the academies to give hourly supervisors and department managers hands-on training in the classroom and on the sales floor, which it says will help them gain retail skills and knowledge to run their specific departments, ultimately helping the people they supervise and improving the experience for customers. "This is a really good learning experience for all of us. I’ve been with Walmart for over 33 years. The training academies are by far the best thing that I have seen Walmart do to train hourly associates, ever," said Thomas Underwood, Walmart regional general manager. The crop of graduates from the Williamstown store all work at the location, but that won’t always be the case with the academy graduates. Each academy across the country will train associates from approximately 25 nearby stores in two-week sessions. More than 140,000 hourly associates will be trained around the country over the course of a year. Each academy, located in or adjacent to a Walmart Supercenter, will have its own team of about 14 associates with retail operations experience to lead the training. Jacqueline Williams, a Williamstown resident, also graduated early Thursday morning. A claims supervisor at the store, Williams said the training academy helped to reinvigorate her. “I wasn’t really enthused about it at first,” said Williams, a 19-year Walmart employee. “As we were sitting in the class, it was what you’ve kind of been asking for, for a long time. If you know anything about Walmart, you have all these stores, all these departments. I could call four different stores for some help or advice and you might come up with four different answers. It wasn’t real cohesive. From the class, it reminded me how it was when I first started ...The company, they hear us. That’s like the best thing.” Walmart, which has 1.5 million employees in the U.S. and 2.3 million workers worldwide, raised its minimum wage to $9 per hour in 2015 and $10 this year. According to the company, full-time hourly associates in New Jersey earn an average of $13.98. The New Jersey minimum wage is $8.25. Recently, Gov. Chris Christie vetoed a minimum wage hike, which would’ve raised it to $15. The federal minimum wage has been $7.25 since 2009. For years, the retail giant had been criticized for its low pay structure and labor practices, and has also faced legal battles with employees in the past. In April, Walmart, Inc., lost its appeal of a multimillion dollar class-action lawsuit to employees from Pennsylvania who said they had to work through breaks. The 186,000 current and former employees had been owed $140 million of the $187 million they sought and are due $224 million with interest. The suit first came up in 2006. Brandy Jordan, senior director of human resources for the Northeast Division for Walmart, said the training academies are not a reaction to anything. “This is not a PR stunt. It’s not to address any of the negative concerns in the media. This is about it was the right thing to do for our associates," Jordan said. “…Over the course of the last 18 months, Walmart’s invested over $2.7 billion into our hourly associates and we’re very proud that the academies are a portion of our investment.” Said Underwood: “Something Doug McMillon, our CEO, is very much behind is making sure we offer our customers the best shopping experience we possibly can. This is one way of doing that.” Walmart also offers a program called Pathways, which Jordan said is a computer-based training program that helps serve the needs of entry-level hourly associates. “We’ve had that program in effect for almost a year,” she said. “We provide them entry-level skill set training. We also start to prepare them for their next role. The academies pick up at our hourly supervisor level for associates.” Asked how it felt to pull that tassel over across her cap, Ford got a little emotional. “I could’ve cried,” she said. “My mom was out there. It was very exciting. I can imagine what it would’ve been like to graduate high school. I didn’t get the chance to do that.” Celeste E.

David Chapman Guest Columnist October 20, 2016 0 A significant transaction took place in the national retail market recently when the world’s largest retailer paid more than $3 billion for the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com. Wal-Mart bought the company in an effort to fight off competition from Amazon, the online industry leader. In 2015, Amazon saw a 97-percent increase in year-over-year sales. Its phenomenal increase is chipping away at the sales-of-brick and mortar national retail chains, like Wal-Mart, Target and Barnes & Noble. Those of us in real estate academia have been predicting this trend for years, but the purchase of Jet.com by Wal-Mart finally confirms what we believed. At the same time, Wal-Mart announced it will slow new store openings and focus on increasing sales in the online space. A month ago Ted Jones, chief economist and senior vice president for Stewart Title Guaranty Co., presented data to the Oklahoma real estate community that showed retail and industrial as the strongest real estate segments in Oklahoma City. While residential and office segments appear to be slowing, rents for retail and industrial space continue to show gains in price per square foot. This latest move by Wal-Mart will create the necessity of other large retailers to counter the move by increasing their focus in the online retail space to compete with Amazon and Wal-Mart. Local retailers relying on brick-and-mortar sales will need to justify their less convenient and more expensive shopping method by concentrating on the customer experience, thereby creating a high-end destination atmosphere in addition to a concierge shopping experience. While the continued consumer move to online purchases is probably not good news for retail in Oklahoma City, it could be really good news for the growing industrial space in our market. With access to interstate highways, rail infrastructure, underutilized airport capacity, relatively inexpensive land, and a centralized location in the middle of the United States, Oklahoma City is one of the most attractive regional and national distribution plays in the country. The current investment in large brick-and-mortar retail stores might just be repositioned in the large, modernized distribution centers to feed this growing online marketplace. When given lemons, make and distribute lemonade. J. David Chapman is an associate professor of finance and real estate at the University of Central Oklahoma (jchapman7@uco.edu).

An attorney for the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union argued that the National Labor Relations Board, not the Benton County judge, should have jurisdiction over the matter. Wal-Mart had sought the order against the union and the Organization United for Respect at Wal-Mart in response to the group picketing at its stores over its pay and benefits. George Wiszynski, the attorney for the union, said the Bentonville-based company’s trespassing complaint was nearly identical to one it had also filed with the national board. “At the end of the day, Wal-Mart relied on the same conduct for its unfair labor practice, its National Labor Relations Board charge as it does for its lawsuit,” Wiszynski told justices. Wal-Mart’s attorney, however, said trespassing is a state issue and was properly before the judge. “Trespass, repeated, defiant trespass absolutely is a significant state interest,” Steven Wheeless told justices. “Second, there is no risk of interference between a state court hearing a trespass claim and a labor board hearing about a labor violation that arose during the trespass.” Wal-Mart sued the union over the demonstrations, which it said has included “flash mobs” where demonstrators have banged on pots and pans march and chant through its stores. Other activities have included rallies and picketing at its stores and offices, the company said. The retail giant has filed similar suits against the union in Florida and Texas in recent years. The union has also argued that the judge’s order was too broad since it bars entering Wal-Mart’s property for “non-shopping” activities, rather than barring the demonstrations that prompted the retailer’s complaint.

Black Friday sales have been interfering with Thanksgiving since 2013, and the most popular stores will be open.  By Rebecca Lehmann, Brad's Deals October 22, 2016 Save for later Saved Holiday shoppers wait in the rain outside a Best Buy in Lawrence, Kan. last year Orlin Wagner/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Malls may close, but the most popular stores aren't likely to give up their foothold on Thanksgiving's turf anytime soon. Looking to history for guidance Taking at look at what Black Friday hours the top players have kept over the last nine years, we can see the long, slow march into Thursday. Click to view the chart  Recommended: Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz. This should surprise absolutely no one who's paid even the smallest bit of attention to  Black Friday over the years, but the visual is striking in that it shows that Black Friday sales have been interfering with Thanksgiving dinner since 2013. That's when  Walmart,  Best Buy and  Toys R Us all crossed over into hours traditionally reserved for Americans' evening meals. Test your knowledge Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz. Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/15 It's telling that after three years of public backlash, with the exception of  Staples, the merchants in our chart haven't pulled back at all. On the contrary, it seems as though they've settled in. The message is clear: Outrage takes a backseat to profitability. Smaller stores will close in greater numbers. Sure, the smaller stores you typically find inside malls are more likely to close, partly under pressure from so many malls across the country that have  effectively made that decision for them. For the vast majority of these stores, you can start shopping their Black Friday sales online at midnight on Thanksgiving morning, anyway, and save all of your crowd-fighting energy for bigger fish. We'll see more mid-tier stores retreat to Black Friday. And we may see more mid-tier defections, like  Office Depot, which followed Staples' lead after watching them closely last year. Likewise, we expect to see more sporting goods stores closing after  REI's wildly popular anti-Black Friday campaign. As heartening as that seems to the anti-Black Thursday crowd, these stores never have been the kind of stores that anyone was really excited to camp out for or hit up at 2am after an exhausting run through Walmart's Black Friday gauntlet. Light foot traffic in the wee hours ultimately doesn't justify the cost of keeping the lights on overnight. The big boxes and major department stores will stick to Thanksgiving open times. But it's  Macy's that's made it clear that the Thanksgiving status quo isn't going anywhere when they announced plans to open at 5pm on Thursday, an hour earlier than last year. There's no retreat happening here. Macy's feels no pressure from the malls since their stores are typically anchors with their own entrances. It doesn't matter if shoppers are angry, just so long as they show up with cash in hand. So in the end, we don't expect to see any earth-shattering announcements from the likes of Walmart, Target, Best Buy and Kohl's. Forget caving to public pressure – they know that shoppers are at their beck and call. If you want a shot at a stellar 4K TV doorbuster, you'll suck it up and be there. Even if your heart is full of resentment. 2016 Black Friday Store Hours Predictions There are our predictions for the Black Friday store hours at some of the most popular merchants. Best Buy - Thursday at 5pm Best Buy has been holding steady at 5pm for a couple years now, and we think they'll stay put. Home Depot - Friday at 6am Home Depot has opened at 6am on Black Friday for many years now. Any change is very unlikely. JCPenney - Thursday at 2pm JCPenney has been pushing earlier and earlier on Thanksgiving for awhile, casting about for an optimal start time. Kmart - Thursday at 7pm There's been very little consistency to Kmart's hours over the last few years. In 2014, they had doorbusters at both 6am and 7pm on Thursday. In 2015 dropped the 6am opening time but kept 7pm. Is that their sweet spot? It seems like a safe bet. Kohl's - Thursday at 6pm Another case of part consistency serving up a solid prediction. Macy's - Thursday at 5pm (CONFIRMED) This one isn't a prediction. Macy's confirmed the news to  CNBC on October 16th. We're treating it as a sign of things to come this season. Sears - Thursday at 6pm They've opened their doors at 6pm for two years running, and we're looking for three. Target - Thursday at 6pm If Walmart stays open on Thanksgiving as expected, there's no way that Target lets that go unanswered. Look for them to match whatever Walmart does. Toys R Us - Thursday at 5pm Toys R Us has been comfortably settled in at 5pm on Thursday for the past three years. Walmart - Thursday at 5pm or 6pm  Walmart has launched their sale at 6pm for the last three years, but we also think there's about a 50/50 chance that they may push it to 5pm for 2016 to steal some of Best Buy's thunder. Not having it? We're also keeping a list of  stores that will be closed on Thanksgiving. This article first appeared in Brad's Deals.

The world’s largest retailer is making an ambitious push into e-commerce in China and aims to deliver goods from its stores around the world to Chinese consumers within hours. Shoppers in select remote villages could even see their Walmart products being delivered by drones as part of a pilot project by its Chinese partner, JD.com. After unsuccessful efforts to scale up its own e-commerce network, Walmart launched several new initiatives this week through a tie-up with JD.com — China’s second-largest e-commerce website, with almost 200 million active users. With this partnership, Walmart said, it will now be able to deliver its goods, ranging from American vitamins to Japanese hand cream, to more than 90 percent of China’s 1.4 billion consumers. “There isn’t another country in the world that represents the kind of retail growth opportunity that China does, given the growth rate of the market itself and the consumer demand here,” Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon, 50, said in an interview in Beijing. “We see opportunities to partner together to provide goods to our customers, to leverage our supply chain and their digital capabilities.” Walmart has a lot riding on its new online strategy aimed at getting a bigger slice of the world’s biggest e-commerce market. The retailer this month forecast that earnings will be flat the next two years while it invests in e-commerce. As it looks to China to fuel growth, Walmart will need to crack the Chinese online game more than ever. “They have found a clever way to leverage someone else’s network to help them sell things online, and it’s easier to jump on the back of JD.com,” said Chan Wai-Chan, a senior partner at Oliver Wyman’s Asia Pacific consumer practice. “They need to do something online to stop e-commerce from taking away their business. This is Walmart’s solution.” McMillon, who took over the top role in 2014, said the initiatives will keep the company’s China operations on track to contribute a quarter of its global retail growth in the next five years. That’s despite sluggish sales at Walmart’s retail stores in China while shoppers there increasingly turn to online websites for convenience. The strategy also gives it access to new Chinese consumers in smaller cities where Walmart doesn’t operate stores. “The scale of the last mile here in China is unique — the economics related to it are different,” McMillon said. “We could have built this ourselves, but everything requires investment. What we are doing is being very deliberate about where we’re putting our resources and being open to working with others.” To reach customers, Walmart is relying on JD.com and its extensive logistics and delivery network. JD.com founder and CEO Richard Liu said the company wants to build a fully automated delivery infrastructure that includes automated warehouses and distribution centers, self-driving delivery cars and drones. The company is delivering products to a limited number of remote villages in southern China by drones. Villagers who order Walmart and Sam’s Club products could see some goods flown to them, according to JD.com spokesman Josh Gartner. Walmart has struggled in China with multiple attempts to get a foothold in the market since its entry two decades ago. In 2007, it acquired Taiwanese chain Trust-Mart, though the company struggled to integrate it into its wider business. In the last few years, it’s pulled back on an expansion. The new strategy follows Walmart’s decision to sell its Chinese e-commerce platform Yihaodian in June in exchange for a 5 percent stake in JD.com.

Amazon Is Coming After the Grocery Business Bloomberg 10/22/2016 Spencer Soper and Craig Giammona © Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images An AmazonFresh truck. For years, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has followed Amazon.com Inc., putting inventory online and starting its own version of a marketplace where third-party merchants can sell their wares. Now Amazon is returning the favor.

Delivering fresh food is complicated and the one thing keeping Amazon and other tech companies from disrupting the grocery business. Most consumers still get their milk, produce and meat from Wal-Mart, Kroger and other traditional grocers. But while e-commerce has yet to take hold in the $800 billion U.S. grocery market, Amazon is betting that could change as millennials accustomed to shopping online enter their prime food-buying years. “We know their best customers are willing to buy groceries online,” says Cowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge. “The onus is on Amazon to deliver because the demand is there.” Amazon began experimenting with the grocery business in 2007 when the company started AmazonFresh in the Seattle area, where the company is based. The service offered doorstep delivery of a limited selection of groceries, saving consumers driving time and the trouble of pushing a shopping cart around a store. The service has slowly expanded to 16 U.S. markets, including Los Angeles, New York and Boston. In June, the company rolled out the service to Prime subscribers in London, the first time it has been offered outside the U.S. Amazon currently offers same-day delivery of more than 130,000 items for 7 pounds ($8.58) per month on top of the cost of Prime.

Earlier this month, the company dropped the price from $299 a year to $15 a month in the U.S. -- $180 annually -- which proved immediately popular with shoppers and emboldened Amazon to accelerate its grocery ambitions, the person said. Delivering groceries to a customer’s home is an expensive and tricky proposition because fresh food spoils and can’t be left at the door like electronics or clothing. It has taken Peapod, the grocery delivery service owned by Royal Ahold, years to figure out how to deliver meat and produce profitably. Instacart, a San Francisco upstart that has partnered with Whole Foods, employs legions of shoppers who troll the aisles and deliver food to customers’ homes. It, too, has struggled to crack the code. Wal-Mart and Kroger have embraced the so-called click-and-collect model. Shoppers select their food online, and then workers fill the order and have it ready for pickup in the store parking lot. Besides side-stepping potential spoilage, Wal-Mart is hoping that shoppers will buy other things once they’ve made it as far as the parking lot. The service has only been around for a few years and is still rolling out nationally, so it’s too early to judge its popularity among the targeted demo of millennial mothers. Amazon, of course, doesn’t have much of a physical presence in the U.S. beyond a few bookstores. So the company is turning to pickup locations for its groceries. In Seattle, Amazon is building facilities that resemble gas stations, where shoppers could pull in and pick up their groceries. Seattle Planning Department documents reveal two similar projects in the city featuring car canopies. One of the sites is near a new Amazon Prime Now distribution hub where shoppers pick up packages ordered through the company’s one-hour delivery service, according to another person familiar with the matter. Construction crews were busy at both locations earlier this week. The company declined to comment. Amazon could also team up with local grocers to offer grocery pickup sites allowing it to expand the concept more quickly than it could by building new locations around the country, according to another person briefed on the plans. In the U.K., Amazon has pickup lockers at stores operated by the Morrisons supermarket chain where shoppers can pick up online orders. Under such partnerships, Amazon can also put the grocers’ inventory on its site. Meanwhile, Amazon is testing the appetite for grocery delivery among Prime subscribers who don’t pay extra for AmazonFresh. Prime members in Southern California and Indianapolis, for instance, can get fresh food delivered from Bristol Farms and Fresh Thyme Farmers Market, via the Prime Now quick delivery service. Further grocer partnerships lets Amazon feel out new markets while competing with Whole Foods-Instacart. Ultimately, Amazon could integrate the Fresh and Prime Now services into one, one of the people said. Amazon’s push into fresh food is a direct threat to the established players. In the U.K., the company has entered a crowded market where Tesco Plc and web grocer Ocado Group Plc have been engaged in a price war for years. Ocado shares plummeted when Amazon announced its U.K. plans. In the U.S., the main tussle will play out between Amazon and Wal-Mart, which is the nation’s largest grocer, generates more than half its sales from selling food and uses cheap food to lure customers to its stores. Time and again, Amazon has shown itself willing to absorb losses while it builds a commanding market share. In groceries, the company is willing to break even in an effort to persuade shoppers to visit the site more often, one of the people said. The big question is whether sizable numbers of Americans will be prepared to purchase fresh food online, sight unseen. For many people, there’s no substitute for personally assessing the ripeness of an avocado or the thickness of a steak. Wal-Mart and other traditional grocers are spending billions to improve the shopping experience and doubling down on prepared meals and private label products you can’t get anywhere else. “There’s still going to be a place for stores that have a good selection and provide that experience,” says industry consultant Roger Davidson. Still, many experts said shoppers wouldn’t buy furniture or cars online. Turns out they will, and Amazon is betting the same will be true of fresh food. 2016 Bloomberg L.P.  Go to MSN Home More in Money Amazing Airstreams: The coolest tiny homes on wheels Lovemoney 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney 7 things you should never do online USA TODAY Up Next 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

More >> Two men and a woman were arrested and charged with murdering a 13-year-old and his father in Toone, Tennessee, according to Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.More >> Toone, TN (WMC) - A 13-year-old boy and his father were shot early Friday morning at a mobile home in Toone, Tennessee, which is in Hardeman County. Sources told WMC Action News 5 that two people have been detained in connection with this crime. The two were found Friday night at the Walmart in Bolivar. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said no one has been charged with the crime at this time. TBI confirms Javarrie "JoJo" Robertson, a 13-year-old student of Toone Elementary School, and his father, Joe Dandrea "Duke" Robertson, 37, were found dead around 7:30 a.m. Two other children, a 5-year-old girl and a newborn, were also inside the home at the time of the shooting. Those two children were not injured. The 13-year-old's life was taken just a few miles from the school he attended.  "There are individuals out there who took the lives of two individuals, including an innocent child. I think that certainly should be troubling for a community," TBI spokesman Josh Devine said. "We want people to be on the lookout, if something doesn't seem right, if there is a problem, if something hits you in the pit of your stomach and you think it seems suspicious, call 1-800-TBI-FIND." Joe Duke's girlfriend lives in the home with them, but she was not home at the time of the murders. Investigators said they are not speculating at this time about what the motive for the killings could be. "It's far too early to speculate," Devine said. "We certainly want to be very careful out of respect for family not to speculate about a possible motive." The murder has shaken the close knit community.  Family members said Javarrie was a great student and overall good child. "Smart. Honor roll student," Adrienne Jones, the victim's aunt, said. "Very smart." According to Javarrie's teacher, Andreia Doyle, the child was recently named "Best Dressed" by his eighth grade class. Family said Javarrie excelled in the sciences and loved playing sports and singing in his church choir. "He was a lively spirit, he was bold, he was a lover of God and a lover of people, very respectful, smart," Jones said. It's hard for Jones to fight past the anger of losing her great nephew.  "God allows things for reasons," Jones said. "But, the flesh part of me says that he had so much more to give us and share with the world and that was just snatched away." She said the boy's father, Joe, was well liked and a family centered individual. "He was joyful. He was nice and kind and he was a family person," Jones said. "I just don't understand what could have happened that this had to take place." Jones said both victims had a lot left to give to the world, but the family will find a way to move forward with love. "They both had so much to give," Jones said. "We move on through the grace of God and through the strength of family and love for one another." Sheena Robertson, a cousin to the family, said the child and his father did not deserve what happened to them. "They were wonderful people like I said," Robertson said. "They didn't deserve it. Wonderful people. We're not going to be able to sleep tonight worrying about it." Former Mayor Willie Spencer attends church with the victims' family. He said Javarrie was a very bright student who got involved with a lot of activities at church, as well as being very active at school. "He was a young man that was dropped off at his father's home, he lived with his mom," he said. "She got word later that a shooting had taken place at the father's home and that [Javarrie] had been shot as well as the father...He had a real promising future and it's unfortunate that a senseless crime like this has taken place in our community." Spencer said even at such a young age, Javarrie was dedicated to his faith. "He was just one of those children who was involved in everything going on in the church: children's ministry, he was involved," Spencer said. "Saying speeches, singing, doing all sorts of things. So, he was just an ideal young man growing up in society." According to Spencer, the child was loved by everyone who knew him and was involved in sports. "He was a great kid. Great kid. His mom raised him well," Spencer said. "He was always outgoing, involved in sports at his school. He was loved by everyone." A large team of local and state investigators, including a violent crimes response team and forensic scientists, are at the mobile home where the crime happened on Naylor Road.  Dozens of people are at the crime scene, hugging one another.  "A lot of family members are here, they can be seen standing around right now, they know the family quite well. We're just here to be supportive," Spencer added. "We don't have anyone in custody. We have not firmed up any sort of suspect description and that is why we urge anyone in the public with specific information that might help, even if it seems insignificant in your mind, it might be significant to us," Devine said. "But to take the life of a young person is so senseless and uncalled for," Spencer said. Students at Toone Elementary School were sad and left in shock at the news their classmate was murdered. Each student was given a note talking about the death of Javarrie and the tragedy left parents wondering what to tell their children. "It's hard to explain at this age the finality of death and at this age you shouldn't have to," parent Cory Vann said.  Javarrie was a member of the school's basketball team and had been at the school to play a basketball game Thursday night. But, the game never happened because the team they were playing didn't show up. "We all rode together to the game," Kylan Beard, JoJo's friend, said. "He was a good friend. He was there for me when I needed help. He, like, gives me a lot of good advice." Beard said the news devastated Javarrie's classmates and those at school. "Everybody just started crying," Beard said.  The school is also providing grief counselors for the students. Although no information about possible suspects has been given by law enforcement, relatives said they believe whoever committed the crime knew the family. Copyright 2016 WMC Action News 5.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries e-Edition Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Rare to have older kids join adults in shoplifting Friday Oct 21, 2016 at 5:40 PM Oct 21, 2016 at 6:38 PM When it happens, officers must use discretion Austin L. Miller @almillerosbJim Ross @JimRossOSB Adult shoplifters employ all sorts of methods. Among the most insidious schemes are those that use children as decoys or unknowing partners. Most times, the kids in cases like these are too young to understand, let alone participate in, the crime. They are infants or toddlers under whose clothing or strollers the stolen items are stashed. But there also is a smaller subset: adults who use older kids as outright accomplices in shoplifting. This latter problem became an issue here locally this week when Ocala police accused a woman and her boyfriend of inducing the woman’s 12-year-old daughter to help them steal clothing from the Wal-Mart on Southwest 19th Avenue Road. The girl had the unusual distinction of being both a suspect and a victim in one single criminal experience: Police arrested the girl and charged her with theft, and then charged her mother with both theft and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The mom bonded out of jail; the girl was held in juvenile detention. The State Attorney’s Office will decide what charges, if any, to lodge against the suspects. *** How often do older kids actually get arrested in connection with adult shoplifting enterprises? This story attempts to place the issue in a broader context and explain how law enforcement and outside experts see, and handle, the problem. There is no doubt that retail theft, in general, is a major business problem. The National Retail Federation reports that, according to its most recent survey, the annual impact of "shrinkage" — a catch-all category to include shoplifting, employee theft and other forms of loss — was about $45.2 billion. Shoplifting in particular is a scourge — and a growing one, at that. "The average loss was $377 per shoplifting incident, up nearly $60 from 2014," the federation reported. The National Association for Shoplifting Prevention says that “more than 10 million people have been caught shoplifting in the last five years.” As for age: According to the association, “approximately 25 percent of shoplifters are kids, 75 percent are adults.” Certainly there are all forms of shoplifting: organized rings, single operators, random cases, serial cases. For juveniles — ages 10 to 17, for example — there can be all sorts of reasons for shoplifting: peer pressure, economic hardship, and so on. What about the specific category of older kids connected with adults? Enter the phrase “using kids as accomplices in shoplifting,” or something similar, into a Google search engine, and dozens of news stories will pop up. But most of them involve very young children. Some examples from news accounts: * On Sept. 27, in Delaware, police arrested a husband and wife on charges that they stole merchandise from BJ’s Wholesale store. Witnesses said the couple’s very young children sat on top of a coat that covered the stolen items in a shopping cart. * In Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania, police say a grandmother had her 4-year-old granddaughter put stolen Sears item into a stroller and pull up the hood to conceal the theft. * In May 2013, in Denver, two parents had their 5-year-old child sit on top of stolen merchandise in a shopping cart. “The stroller/car seat/diaper bag method is probably the top of the list” for parents making use of small kids, said J. Patrick Murphy, president of LPT Security Consulting in Tomball, Texas. Far less common are news stories about older kids who are accused of working with an adult shoplifting “partner.” Earlier this year the Chicago Tribune reported on a Naperville woman accused of directing her three children, ages 7 to 13, to assist in stealing items from Wal-Mart. The story doesn’t mention whether the older child, like the one in Ocala, was arrested. How common is arrest of a young person who is caught along with an adult? “My opinion is that it is rare by comparison simply because the juveniles also get jail time. The little ones are released,” said Murphy, who is a national security expert. It’s also somewhat rare because even shoplifters have a moral compass that steers them away from stealing while in front of — let alone while helped by — their children. So says Chris McGoey, a retail security expert based in Los Angeles. After 45 years in the business he estimates that only 2 percent of 3 percent of shoplifters would get their older kids in on the crime. *** Even these thieves know “it’s not a badge of honor to be a thief,” McGoey said. These outside observations jibe with reports from local law enforcement agencies. The Star-Banner reached out to officials from the Belleview, Dunnellon and Ocala police departments, as well as the Marion County Sheriff’s Office. They all agreed that it's rare to have adults and juveniles arrested together for shoplifting, and that some discretion must be exercised in the cases that do pop up. Sheriff's Capt. Brain Dotten, a property crimes supervisor, said sometimes the store policy has the greatest influence on how law enforcement handles a case. Some stores don't seek to press charges against anyone under a certain age — or for thefts under a certain dollar amount. As for arrest: Dotten said it depends on what the detective or deputy learns from the child during an interview. If the child seems to have been forced or coerced into stealing merchandise, then he or she won’t be arrested. Ocala Capt. Carmen Sirolli, a supervisor in the Major Crimes Unit, said a recent retail theft blitz did not turn up any cases involving a child and adult arrested together. But that doesn't mean it can't happen. And again, as with the Sheriff's Office, when those cases arise, the officer and his or her supervisor make a judgment call on arrest of the youngster. Dunnellon Chief Mike McQuaig said his agency would try to refrain from arresting juveniles if they can prove that the child had no participation in the theft. McQuaig said they rarely see cases where adults or parents are arrested with juveniles for theft. The child’s mental capacity, more than age, is the key element. Belleview Chief Terry Holland said that if, after interviewing the child, the officer feels the juvenile took an active role in the theft 1 and they can prove that the child knew right from wrong — then an arrest will be made. But even in those rare cases, Holland said, the officer won’t arrest the child and take him or her to juvenile lockup. Instead, the officer will take the child to the police department, fill out the paperwork, and then call a parent, guardian or relative to pick up the child. — Contact Jim Ross at 671-6412 or jim.ross@starbanner.com.

Sign up for The Power Lunch: Florida Politics newsletter - our must-read, weekday roundup of Florida political news and buzz >> Local News Broward News Oakland Park News Oakland Park still at odds with Wal-Mart plan Larry BarszewskiContact ReporterSun Sentinel Wal-Mart still can't get the green light in Oakland Park. The city continued its standoff with Wal-Mart as commissioners rejected a special magistrate's findings and said the company must bury power lines on its Oakland Park Boulevard site if it wants to build a supercenter there. The effort by Vice Mayor John Adornato and Commissioner Jed Shank to end the dispute died in a tie vote on Wednesday, with Commissioners Sara Guevrekian and Michael Carn voting no. Mayor Tim Lonergan did not vote, citing a conflict of interest. "If we deny this, we will be sued. We will expend significant dollars of city taxpayers on our attorney's fees and we will lose," Adornato said. Guevrekian and Carn insisted the power lines be placed underground, despite Wal-Mart's position that FPL will not allow transmission lines to be buried on the eastern portion of the former Kmart property at Northeast Sixth Avenue. Steve Wherry, an attorney representing Wal-Mart, said the company is considering how to respond, which could include going to court. "I don't see it as being within the realm of possibility that Wal-Mart can accept the suggestion," Wherry said. "It's practically impossible."

The funding together with the Walmart Foundation will support projects in applied science, education and communications, according to the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer at a briefing held in Beijing, where it also launched the Walmart Food Safety Collaboration Center to bring together local and international research. “By bringing together the best food safety thinkers from across the food ecosystem, from farmers to suppliers, retailers to policy regulators, we’ll accelerate food safety awareness and help make Chinese families safer and healthier,” Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said at the event in Beijing on Wednesday.

One of those employees with the New York State Office for People with Developmental Disabilities, Lynn Knightner, stole money from residents with developmental disabilities to take her family to see a performance of “How to Train Your Dragon Live Spectacular” in 2012. She also made “questionable” restaurant gift card purchases to restaurants her colleagues do not remember taking any of their residents to, according to the report. “With disturbing regularity we have seen the shameless preying on a vulnerable population by those charged with their care,” New York State Inspector General Catherine Leahy Scott said in a statement. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The pilfering of cash accounts maintained by the New York State Office for People with Developmental Disabilities was described as “widespread and prolific.” The report highlighted findings from 10 separate investigations across the state, from the Buffalo region to the Hudson Valley and found inadequate accounting safeguards and outright thefts. Among the mismanagement and thefts highlighted in the report and in the inspector general’s news release: • Knightner, a developmental assistant for a West Seneca group home, stole more than $250 from six residents in 2012 to take her own family to see the “How to Train Your Dragon Live Spectacular.” She attempted to cover up the fact that none of the residents went to the show by buying them souvenirs from the show and playing the movie DVD for them so they would be familiar with the story. She also used the residents’ money to buy restaurant gift cards and fabricated restaurant receipts. As a result of the investigation, Knightner was arrested and pleaded guilty to larceny and falsifying business records. Knightner’s plea required that she pay restitution to the victims and perform 100 hours of community service • An employee for a group residence in East Randolph in Cattaraugus County was charged with stealing money from the personal accounts of seven residents in 2013. The investigation also revealed that the residents’ personal items, valued at $820, also went missing at the group home. • In late 2014, an employee pretended to use the personal bank cards of her group home residents outside Albany to buy Christmas gifts on their behalf. In reality she used the bank cards on purchases for herself. • The house manager for a community residence in the Hudson Valley stole nearly $7,400 from resident accounts to buy name-brand sneakers, musical equipment and a recliner, among other things. • An employee with a group home in Corning stole $130 in Wal-Mart gift cards that were supposed to be gifts for residents’ families in December 2012. The employee, Cheryl Collins, was seen on department store surveillance tape use the cards for herself and was arrested. The thefts and improprieties were so common and widespread that more cases of theft and abuse were reported to the Inspector General’s Office even while the report was being written, according to the release. The Office for People with Developmental Disabilities employs about 23,000 employees, who provide services to approximately 128,000 New York residents with developmental disabilities in institutional and community settings. In response to the findings, Leahy Scott made recommendations that the Office for People with Developmental Disabilities has agreed to adopt. Recommendations include more training for the handling and oversight of personal cash accounts and new audits to better track and determine how group home residents’ money is being spent. “These heinous crimes not only need to be vigorously investigated and prosecuted,” Leahy Scott said, “but significant reforms must also be implemented that not only make such crimes less feasible, but protects the integrity of funds in these personal accounts.” © 2016 The Buffalo News Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Pinterest Email Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Find a Job AFC Care Manager CBDS Case Manager Behavior Analyst Asst/Assoc Professor-Spec Ed Executive Director View all jobs Post a Job More in Living Comments DISABILITY SCOOP WELCOMES COMMENTS, THOUGH ONLY A SELECTION ARE PUBLISHED.

I imported some patriotism from Staten Island (aka met my friend Warren at the ferry terminal) and we headed straight for this new burger place – only to find it closed. The place opened up 5 hours later than their Facebook page said they would, so we had to search for another place to eat. Sorry, Merica NYC Burgers, but you’re not getting reviewed this week (and it’s your fault). Our brief search for another burger joint ended when we found Paul’s Da Burger Joint at St. Mark’s Place & Second Avenue. On the outside, it only looked moderately more appealing than any other East Village restaurant, with a small storefront with a lot of neon lights and a sign that said “voted best burger in NYC.” I’ve definitely never seen that sign before. Warren and I were gravitating towards it though, so we went in and found a pleasant surprise. When I walked in, I thought I had walked into a burger joint in the West during 80’s or 90’s. The walls were full of old-school metal signs advertising their special burgers, NYC street signs, and Americana signs, such as a “Yankees fans only seating” sign (there was a similar one for Mets fans in the back), a sign that reads “Beer is now cheaper than gas. Don’t drive, drink,” and an exit sign for Yankee Stadium. I assume the exit sign was stolen form the Major Deegan Expressway, and all of the road work there is replacing that sign. Those are just the memorable signs. Even better, they played good classic rock and pop. The menu is well over 50% burgers, but there were a few sandwiches and omelettes at the bottom of the menu. Regrettably, I cannot review the milkshakes (since my stomach is in a bit of a love-hate relationship with dairy right now) but I can talk about their burgers. Warren and I both ordered the “El Paso Burger,” a cheddar cheeseburger with jalapenos. My initial reaction to the burger, and the first thing I said after taking a bite was, “I can taste the freedom in this burger.” We had finally found our all-American burger joint, despite our initial setback with Merica NYC Burgers. I know my initial reaction is very vague, but it’s honestly how I would sum up the burger. The beef was clearly fatty, yet high quality beef that I could tell was from the middle of the country just by its taste. The cheddar pretty much served its purpose as a complement to the burger, but the jalapenos were too mild. Overall, I rate the burger a solid 4.5/5. A few other burgers on the menu that stood out to me were the Pizza Burger with mozzarella and pizza sauce, the Eastsider Burger with ham, mushrooms, tomatoes, and onions, and the St. Mark’s Burger with mushrooms and fried onions. You can create your own burger with your own toppings, but I recommend trying something from their menu. Yes, ham is an odd topping for a burger, but you might like it. I’ll most likely get a hamburger with ham next time. Also, small portion freaks be warned: these aren’t small burgers. The bill came out to about $13 per person since we both bought deluxe burgers. It’s not the best burger I’ve ever had, but it’s better than good enough, and what really makes Paul’s great is the theme and authenticity of the place. There are too many great local businesses that have been booted out of this city by one thing or another – rent, hipsters, chains, etc. The East Village is mostly in tact, which is one reason that I like the place, and Paul’s is a great example of why it’s good to have local, old-time businesses stay in a neighborhood. It adds some authenticity and character to the place. Additionally, they’re one-of-a-kind – people will come into the neighborhood to go to their favorite restaurant, but they won’t travel very far to go to a chain restaurant. I will certainly go back to the East Village for Paul’s many times.

Police responded to calls of a man shoplifting video games from the Walmart at 1300 Des Plaines around 2:30 p.m. Thursday. Security personnel at the store attempted to apprehend the suspect but he fled to a nearby cemetery. A Forest Park police officer who arrived on the scene chased the suspect towards the west edge of the cemetery, police said, which is divided by the Des Plaines River. Instead of being trapped by the river, the man jumped in and got to the other side. Additional officers then tried to arrest him there, but he jumped back into the river and tried to swim across again. At some point, police officials say, the man pulled out a knife and put it to his neck, prompting one of the officers pursuing him to fire a shot, striking him in the hip. He transported to Loyola University Medical Center in  Maywood with non life-threatening injuries. The two officers involved in the shooting incident were also transported to the hospital as a precaution. The Illinois State Police Public Integrity Unit is investigating the incident.

Alvin David Sheets, 67, of Edwardsville, and formerly of Lehighton, pleaded to two counts each of simple assault and possession of drug paraphernalia and one count of false reports. Sheets was arrested on Jan. 22 at the Walmart store in Mahoning Township, where he assaulted a man. Sheets was bothering two female customers at the store  when another customer tried to intervene. He punched the man in the face. The other assault occurred on May 26, 2015, involvinganother man as the victim and charges filed by state police at Lehighton. The two drug charges stem from incidents on April 10 and the Walmart assault incident. The false reports was filed by Lehighton police for an incident on Dec. 2, 2015, when Sheets reported his car stolen when it wasn’t. Sheets said his conduct was due in part to a drug habit and not taking his medications for a mental health issue stemming from his service in the military during the Vietnam War. He told Judge Joseph J. Matika, “I’m getting too old for this.” He added that since he has been in the county prison, he has been receiving his medication and now has a “clear head” and promised to keep taking the medications. Matika sentenced him to a total of two to 12 months in prison followed by one year of probation. He was given credit for 63 days already served and paroled. He was also ordered to render 50 hours of community service, get both drug and alcohol and mental health evaluations, pay court costs of about $1,000 and pay a $50 per month supervision fee while on probation or parole. On the two drug counts he was fined a total of $400.

Chief Tim Tollison with the Easley Police Department said the incident went down Saturday afternoon when a vehicle was stolen from a victim in the parking lot of an Easley Walmart.  The victim tried to step in front of the vehicle as the suspect took off, was struck and then reportedly jumped onto the hood of the vehicle as it drove across multiple parking lots.  According to Chief Tollison, the victim was dragged from the top of the vehicle hood near a Kohl's department store. The victim was then transported by EMS to the hospital and treated for minor bruises, cuts and scratches. Police said the victim was released from the hospital around 2:30 pm. but was gone before they arrived and wouldn't answer or return phone calls. Chief Tollison said surveillance footage showed the suspect's car pulling up next to the victim's, and that he thought the whole incident seemed suspicious. The department will continue to investigate the case. Copyright 2016 FOX Carolina (Meredith Corporation). All rights reserved.

His mother a full-time housekeeper, and father a full-time landscaper, did their best to provide for their five children while earning a minimum wage, which more times than not was not enough. Experiencing his parents’ struggles living off of minimum wage income in jobs that required demanding hours, and offered no overtime or pay raises, Rodriguez said he knew he had to change the system. This led him to run for City Council in National City, one of the poorest cities in the county. “It’s very difficult now in America. It is very difficult to make it in to the middle class,” he said.  “National City residents deserve higher wages.” Rodriguez, 31, fully supports an increase to the minimum wage, especially in National City. The state-mandated minimum wage is $10 per hour. Rodriguez said he would like to see National City’s minimum wage increase to $15 an hour for large businesses. He called $15 an hour a “standard living wage.” If elected, he said he will serve the nearly 60,000 residents by requiring large businesses in the city such as Wal-Mart, McDonald’s, Starbucks and other giant corporations to pay their employees a higher working wage. “Places like that are multi-billion dollar companies,” he said. “They can afford to invest in our community a little more by investing in their own workers.” For small businesses, he said, the statewide minimum wage will eventually bring them up to $15 per hour in 2022. Rodriguez believes higher wages will not only benefit workers but will also have positive effects for the National City economy. He said a higher minimum wage in National City means workers are paying more in local taxes, which he said translates into more revenue for the city budget and more money to pay for city services. “The solution to our problems isn’t to raise taxes, the solution is to increase wages so that people spend more so that they pay more in taxes and hence our budget grows more,” he said. Rodriguez considers himself a “workers’ advocate” and has the support of labor unions in his race. When he is off the campaign trail, Rodriguez spends his time as a stay-at-home father to his three young daughters. His wife, Sandra Rodriguez, works as a dual immersion teacher at an elementary school in El Cajon. He last worked for the San Diego-Imperial Counties Labor Council for nearly five years, where he was tasked with organizing, structuring and running political campaigns of candidates backed by the union. He left that job in March to focus on his campaign. Rodriguez admits his stance on raising the minimum wage in National City is not a popular one. “If I’m going to run for office I am going to run on the ideals that I believe in. That I whole-heartedly believe in,” he said. Rodriguez left Coachella Valley for San Diego to attend college. He attended San Diego City College before transferring to San Diego State University where he earned a bachelor’s degree in history. Rodriguez and his wife bought a home in National City three years ago. “I felt at home here,” he said. “There are hard-working people here, just like the people I met every day in the [Coachella] Valley.” Rodriguez said he wants a National City that can prosper. “My vision for National City would be one in which most of our families are homeowners, where most of our families are part of the middle class and have good jobs, God willing have enough money to take vacations,” he said. “I wish for once we would focus on the middle class, I wish for once we focus on what the working people need in our community.” E-mail Author Print Story RSS Feed Rate This Article 0 vote(s) Average Vote 0/5 1 2 3 4 5 anniej Says: Thu, Oct 27 2016 02:16 PM 'Support of labor union' - PLA???????

Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong) Oct 22, 2016 at 2:18PM Image source: Getty Images. Attention seniors, it's that time of the year again -- open enrollment for Medicare Part D, also known as the prescription drug plan portion of Medicare, is under way, as it is every year between Oct. 15 and Dec. 7. During this period, eligible Medicare enrollees have the opportunity to shop around and compare prescription drug plans for the upcoming year under original Medicare. This is also when enrollees can peruse alternative options with a Medicare Advantage plan, which combines all aspects of Medicare, including drug coverage, into one plan. Big prescription drug increases are headed seniors' way Choosing a prescription drug plan is particularly important for seniors since they tend to be more prone to expensive illnesses compared to younger adults. According to a study from the Kaiser Family Foundation, seniors taking drugs to treat hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis, or cancer can spend anywhere from $4,000 to $12,000 per year out-of-pocket just to take a single drug -- and this includes what a Medicare prescription drug plan would cover. Another recent AARP study, Rx Price Watch, found that average annual prescription drug costs have ballooned from $4,140 in 2005 to $11,341 as of 2013 for elderly Americans. Long story short, picking out the right prescription drug plan is critical to ensuring that seniors get the most out of their plan. So what are seniors looking at as we head into open enrollment period? According to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), prescription drug plan (PDP) premiums are rising by an average of 9% in 2017 to $42.17, based on the weighted average of 2016 plan enrollment. KFF's estimate includes premiums for basic and enhanced prescriptions plans, and makes the assumption that enrollees stick with their current plan, which may not always be the case. Image source: Getty Images. As KFF also points out, costs continue to vary greatly for Medicare Part D plans. Among the 10-most enrolled plans in 2016, the average monthly premiums in 2017 range from a low of $16.81 a month for the Humana Wal-Mart Rx plan, which works out to just over $200 a year, to $71.66 monthly for the AARP Medicare Rx Preferred plan, which works out to about $860 annually. Similar differences, though perhaps not to the extreme of the low-end and high-end differing by a factor of four, are seen in individual states, with some seniors looking at cheaper coverage options than others. How to get the best Medicare drug plan With rising prescription drug costs looking like a near-certainty moving forward, seniors need to be diligent in their efforts to pick out a PDP that suits their needs best. Here are a few tricks to ensuring you get the best possible value for your Part D plan. The first step is to shop around. The worst possible thing you can do is to simply allow yourself to be reenrolled in the same plan as last year. Though some seniors will find benefits from reenrolling, this isn't always the case. Part D plans may be contracted through Medicare, but they are offered by private insurance companies that have the ability to alter their coverage from year to year. Just because the drugs you take were covered by your 2016 PDP doesn't mean they'll be covered under the same plan, or at the same rate, in 2017. Taking the time to shop around with Medicare.gov's Plan Finder is a smart move you really should make. Also keep in mind that your window-shopping period should include a look at alternative Medicaid Advantage plans, too, to see if they offer you a better bang for your buck. Secondly, it's important that you understand the difference between co-pays and co-insurance, especially with more PDPs pushing co-insurance as drug prices soar. Co-payments are flat fees that you pay for each prescription you fill. Co-pays could differ based on the tier of drug you're paying for, but they're otherwise consistent across a tier. Co-insurance, on the other hand, requires the Medicare member to pay a percentage of the total prescription cost. If the drug you're paying for is in one of the higher cost tiers, you could be looking at a lot of money out of pocket -- and don't forget, there are no annual out-of-pocket limits with Medicare. If you can, target plans with a focus on co-pays, or at the very least pay attention to what the co-insurance would be on your medications and seek out the plan(s) with the lowest co-insurance. Image source: Getty Images. Third, ask your doctor if generic options are a possibility. According to the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, 88% of prescriptions written today are for generic drugs. By 2020, this figure is expected to rise to between 91% and 92%. If you can find a substitute for your brand-name medication that works just as well, you may be able to save in excess of 80% on your out-of-pocket drug costs. Fourth, take note of what tier the drugs you take fall into. Most PDPs use a five-tier system for prescription drugs, with a higher tier signifying a more specialized and costly drug that'll cost you more out of pocket. Drug tiers can be somewhat variable from one plan to the next, and they can also change from year to year, which can mean a dramatic increase or decrease in out-of-pocket costs. Drugs can be removed from an insurer's approved formulary, too. This is all the more reason to take the time to really compare plans around this time of year. Finally, don't be late! Forgetting to enroll in a PDP during the defined period (Oct. 15 through Dec. 7) can be costly, with penalties attached that follow you around for the remainder of your enrollment in Medicare (essentially the rest of your life).

That is our number three final wild mustard and Johnson's show. As we go to high noon John to mossy has a new partner noses in regular thing now. IA britney's gonna answer the way the giants court should have yet that I have no idea here attorney says Derek is joining. John to mossy ads at 12 o'clock today I'm sure they're gonna get into more than just brown the situation. We're talking about how the NFL. Half heartedly. At best. Investigated that situation of course that work all that energy all those resources all those dollars. In two deflated football so there's a lot of certainly a lot of anger. In justified resentment around these parts and we are talking about all that review. Interesting I was reading not a Kodak now that manner produces and by Chet polonium. In it was about Josh brown and Howard grew up in a Christian home and values and them went to Nebraska. There in the HS. As somebody who just really really really lost his way and again I am angry with him very disappointed with him and all of that he did. But at the same time I only fault him to a certain degree that if these things were known along to our primary goal. Then they should have been dealt with van and he was obviously somebody in need of some serious. Help. That's why when I look at the powers to be in the NFL instead of trying to really help him. But instead hiding it in. Hiding is right by the way nobody says anything about his wife and his kids or anything are they getting any support I'm getting any. Assistants I help for the national pro probably got no Drudge browse they're gonna get his wind. Point four million dollar remainder of his contract is just a very. You know the more you look into some of these things LSU like some of these people who are in power positions to make change. But they don't. So all are you looking at this article from 2012. The conversation. About christianity really. And Josh Brown says in this article is no measure to the grace that god has shown me no measure every day we thank him for that. We make our kids very aware of how fortunate we are not only financially but just to be together to have a home. To have the ability to love one another relief. And practice our faith really one of the things you learn and if you learn nothing else from me in the last. 122 years is that. I've said early on when we came together Miami Christian I mean follower of Jesus Christ I mean senator. But that he does that went to across pay for my sins and I am forgiving. Now that doesn't mean I won't do whatever I feel like going and gobble excuse that there is an ultimate punishment. Through that not eternal punishment but punishment here if you won't hold up a store or something and they were resting you're using my Christian values to go to jail. So I mean that you have to be very careful nowadays are people throughout terms entitles them alike. I'm missing and then condemn and and you know and condemn everybody. I'm if one person claims to be something but they acted different way I think you have to go back to the original doctor and and see what is required and it is is certainly after trying conduct yourself as best you can. We make mistakes I know I do I make a lot of them and you pray and ask for God's forgiveness and that's in a Christian is ultimately your faith is in Christ but. I don't know we have this guy lost it he said besides this is the stuff that happened about seven years old so. I have no idea how he lost his way I had no idea right let's get back to fonts it's 6177797937. Lisa downing Coventry were island you're next police credit rating for Euro. I'm don't know how why yeah. I love the heat and the pizza. I'd been waiting for your Matt and some women call today. I like and I admire green. That was good. I'm not alone men and I want to talk about that's. Okay. I I don't belong mask his demands mean. Demand. Stick violent. Programs for these. Football players that they have to go to sessions. I like to think they're there are yeah yeah. I think that's very important NAND. You know it would just found you reap what to solve. He did it despicable thing. And I mean he made in the states and mistakes. You know I I I'm a born again Christian and I know that went to out of born again Christian unity Christ is his thing there. And it does change you know high. And you still make mistakes but you are forgiven. But your kid you not you can't contenders like go out do the same thing over twenty times. Now you can't there's something wrong on there. But if I I heard that he just became a born again Chris. Brought in according to methodically grew up in a Christian home. All right a may be re dedicated comes up let's said that's all well and good believe it or not he's a pot of this story but the main part of the story. It's how the National Football League Goodell and company Batman nobody is trying to cover it up cash kind of brush it aside. That's wrong that's absolutely wrong and I don't care pillar in my patriots fan. And if Tom Brady being deployed I think he should be drawn out of football for the things in life I don't care if you're a big star or not. We know you did do a domestic violence feel like he should be penalized for it and punish. Boy amen amen now do I think a person can go on to certain guys certain counseling sessions and then. Eventually be given another chance I think and possibly a different. Oh I think so I think someone. I think someone should be given a second chance that they approve them. Amber Ray Rice who has never give Ray Rice president given that animate because he was on the decline anyway. Ray Rice ray Reza remember he dragged his fiancee I don't itinerant con artists are out of an elevator never play another game where it's all right so it says here on my caller screen. Lisa from Coventry Josh Brown should be given another chance do you believe that Josh Brown should have a opportunity to redeem themselves somehow. If it had been next fear he definitely him about that riot broke the divorced. Eat the oldest of four I'm out. If there in the next here you go to counseling you prove himself he does good deeds he is a born again Christian yes I think he could begin the second camp. Was not so must I listen I'll be delighted if you sincerely. Does become is a born again Christian but. Whether he does that I'm not the fact of the matter is he has a counseling program. The thing with him is I think he's 34 runs out and thirty said he seven so that's kind of old in the game anyway. To wait on him to get his act together. I suspect. Him being a good Christian or not thanks for the call Lisa thanks Melissa I I would be. Shocked beyond shocked. If Josh Brown ever gets another chance he's the only before partly open but the douse them trying to think of his great party yeah I mean a fine yeah. You know it's interesting now fifth. There are gonna vote assign these why is that them and then opt out hot -- of a sudden forgiveness runs out I wanna get rid of sadly the moral outrage it is all over the place all of a couch Jerry Jones said you know we don't really want him Erica Needham played out well easy to take a stand when the guy can't perform the expectation of the 6177797937. Down to Miami a year ago Steve you're next on portrait stave. I apple and it's not how you're doing. Well it's so disgusting and I'll Sewell. I'm not telling you. Or calm patriots had your bit to me they do what news. Should be done by every team in this mission like that when Aaron in this in the broader respect and communities but it still. Physical in person they switched. In a written weeks or desperate they dismiss them as I mean this whole tank. It was simply cute it's. Mr. nobody. Don't Wear ties and Diego. Talking about integrity always integrity of these kind of eight election absolutely no integrity and I think that on these lock me in a separate. And sorrows. You shipped. These people serious I mean because that is just front and again in a moment. But also outlook which is in perfect. Yeah you're in October with the angles. Yeah it's ridiculous I have that for lunch. Yeah. But really the accident out of my I obviously want second delay. You are. I guess you're. And already there's games mean he's not through hardship happy I guarantee. And I noticed since. Something that we patriots and all is well. If it is and this has happened to the. That's an interesting question grandma and Vera -- I think course where it seems like it's it's at a high tower now something had been you know accused of that going to be very interesting. Whether I'd Goodell would have the same fervor going after him in the end you know and you're talking about perfect a lot of people earlier before the revelations about Josh Brown earlier in the week people were kind of surprised at all the NFL did it was fine member fixed 75 and ran a joke instead of suspending him again and you're absolutely right. If a patriot did that there would be. Held the pay as far as patriots are concerned a city -- question yet very good question thanks for the call actually he's 77797937. We go to Charlotte. In Andover hello Charlotte. Our Shalit in morning you know you thank you so much for calling him. Well thank you for having. You. Asked earlier about whether the top level quarterback had had been charged how we just it as opposed to a ticker right. Well what about Peyton Manning last year that was pretty poorly investigated. Very poorly investigated with that it yet they knew we was out the door. And that was. Event taking the blame game on now want to witnesses were discredited. Victim was discredited. Any step in the Booth in so doing appearances and so do. Commercials removes some of his life and there's the difference here is even though it was a ultimately replace the bowl kicker they had. Hard evidence that they would not ignore that's the problem they try to they tried to ignore yup. Yes they did trying to Norton and I. You know the same thing the previous callers about the effect this week. I honestly if it was we're patriots involved definitely. Then that chatter would be its nose patriots again and that would be the story not. What the by violation was but. And I think as an you know as much as Bob Kraft has been a mover and shaker in the NFL on the TV committee and you know I it was a long time supporter of the detail before. The deflate anybody else there is right I think think a lot of their way to support John Mara. John Merritt is powerful he's in New York owner yeah ours he showed no mercy to the patriots either it's accurate but a lot of I mean we don't have any evidence on this either but there were a lot of people suspect John Mara. Was none too supportive of Bob Kraft and the patriots in deflate gate. But believed for some reason wants to help the giants as much as they can about the giants if it attracts right in Itamar family of course goes back to the original. That the original franchises back in 1925 cell. I I do think there was more favoritism to say the least. In their half hearted investigation of the giants. As opposed to what happened with the flake. Yes tough job to do here this is that arguably the highest profile player currently. Super Bowl champion team and nobody wanted to see this happen. By his job is to enforce the rules against. The same way and consistently with four players and that's when attempting to politicking attempt to do that. We judge brown kind of late now how about the bond right that is John Mara by the way talking about the late gate and some people fought that perhaps John Mara wasn't. Quite deed the objective owner Malik called mr. IndyCar benefit Eva yeah no question about it 6177797937. Gloria you're next in Sports Radio. Laura we hi Gloria Van Morrison you are now. I'm from New York City water bread at the giants and why can't quote yelled at eight bring him to the members currency on your program and they all act. Probable released. Olson remember yes and I wrote a letter into the Patriot Act. And they wouldn't print it because I worked. And the Asia what to do. You know. Obama. Not being able locker room. And what does that got to do is jobs out being a Christian it doesn't matter what they eat crow I don't you know I'm Kirsten thank Christian doesn't act like that trust. Any hard and yeah I am not meet his wife his girlfriend these children thing. This thing happened to Tom Brady I wrote in and called and as an act sell in more concerned about balls and anything else. Line. Yeah I and I I think the the resentment. Among the other 31 owners toward that all patriots success over the last 1516 years with pal. NASA had to use committee. I don't I asked the same question on and understand how you establish his committee. Opera spousal abuse acceptance on it and. I had the if you already had to reach every met OJ put that bought his wife. That got out of that rally as of now it doesn't but it out. I mean they out and they have a restraint in not and they have proved that someone has done that like they had it way right. Bragging that woman out of the elevated. The opening them to carry to do. Yeah. How big and still get. I believe it yet on just brown is on paid leave Ager Peterson is on paid leave of course he played against Ray Rice and Josh we're artists don't get in his contract yeah. Let me ask you this do you watch in the game tomorrow giants and rams. My neck and finally mitigate the minute you log in a market. Does that is that. Right so how okay wed event I am a Gloria I give you credit. War speaking out against the giants against your team on the other hand do you how can. Expect when you like it back to the giants bank can't write you back I can't let it go Wellington. Yup and when they say make sure you watch the game to. Are now didn't that it's packing you know being up here I don't have direct G-8 where I am I you being hypocritical watch the game. No I don't feel that way I got by one thing I enjoyed college. Do shots aren't in yet college Nebraska. OK check if you. And in trouble own words Hillary and some other places why don't get it right up in college like we get away with it. You know what if you can play you can get away with it I'm waiting for the the obligatory Steve Nelson quote had learned that you what's that. Don't you you tell me. Oh. Hey aha I'm sure Gloria. Well I. You ask for Werman Collins Maine there rougher than them on yet seniors Matt asked evidence for around the world times it is the problem it's. Here's. Is the proud and it's one thing for patriots in to say I hate the NFL delivers the walked the patriots I guess you could make slight case that although I don't agree with that. These people it's all they have yet. And all they have got nothing else in their life but now getting an update 930 and is that in order to notch a T and some cases unfortunately now. 617779. 7937. We still got about a half hour ago before we make way for. Training and Tomas it's the new hit show right here on Sports Radio WEEI. H one Daylon hobbies to consumers' preference in June 2016 stepped mustard and Johnson or. Sports Radio 93 point seven WEEI WEEI dot com. That the violence you have him on your. Mean you knew he admitted he hinted that they book came out in the journal. Intensely personal and comparable to read. An and an indictment of his own behavior. But the giants had this information before has and they kept him on the roster. That's consuming domestic violence make no mistake you can wanna support someone and you can reach out to someone but at the same time you have to let them take. The six game penalty you can't say we're not issuing a penalty we're just gonna support of that undermines everything NFL is tried to do on domestic bounce the last few years. As Jane McManus on ESP yen well sad and that obviously exposes the giants in the National Football League to a larger extent we're being. Hypocrites as we know they are let me answer question if if I'm undergoing counseling program and power of accounting program is writing in the journal and should those. But I'm writing me being Catholic yeah an and that is interesting because you think those are private thoughts their therapeutic. I'm trying to defend the guy and really. That's and the giants during the giants were trying to have it both ways they understood the gravity of the situation I'm sure they weren't. This under. Or underestimating. The problem at the same time they wanted to be supportive. And they knew that those documents existed they probably suspected. That the issue was far beyond a one time only deal. And they went out of their way to make sure that the public did not know about it unfortunately for them and fortunately for us they did actually. Become exposed I think that's important but we're big go from here what can the National Football League. Do now. So much for those setup but I I pay out panel what there's women they hide it and let the woman Tom you know that come up there are some rules. That people have to abide by. No question about that what's gonna shell in New Hampshire is next in Sports Radio Michel. Obligation. How are you man. I'd I want to shed light on concussions. Yes or. And anger management. You know. It was brought to my attention and many years ago when my daughter strapped for her. Three big concussion in her life playing high school and middle school sports. And after the that are really RO connection. After that hurt really bad actually we're driving somewhere and she out of the blue extremely angry and started hitting me. And I pulled over. And I'd react you know we went for Iraq. And I realized. Then that she did. Help because her anger issues we're stemming from the concussion about two weeks elapsed. Actually no we're talking basketball soccer. And and I know people have concussion on their mind would well. It happens all the sports is she okay if you can now. She's learning now because like Joker two Russian special out of mustang yeah how little we won. When they have bad concussion anybody. In certain areas of rain and reaction. Triggered instantaneously. And they lash out at and and it's it's really not something that they can control. Okay do. You know what to give it. You know what the difference I'm still say no but you know it did you know what the difference in but the differences Michelle you to record get help. See why why I shall it. Be because they're afraid of what you're afraid of what they'll find. So oh I'll keep it short a Bloomberg. It Mike Shannon and I. We don't watch them on a lucky anymore we would listen to on the radio and I wrote that so many other people are so fed up with the NFL. Doing there they're ignoring Chela I'd. Televised urgent. Let me ask you this though Michelle and I just. Some little curious why is listening to the game more palatable than actually watching. I don't feel like immediate much money. I had moon and everything on the radio anxious about our little way of tunes are. Forget the dollars we want it still not let that at one but we also have let go watching other games. And I that I feel and a gentleman with a at the lab watch them but at the same time outlet outlet on the radio and hopefully. It seems to me that there's a lot more people that have just sort of like bell as a result. It's ridiculous. You know that pairing of lake City Council is just absolutely. Yeah particularly around here yeah that is now. More deeper than that I think they NFL and all of them all of national sports really made as our collegiate. And a concussion. And again imagine that aren't are not expecting people who are making. I mean top of the individuals we really need. You know get a handle on them and ankle deep or they're being and and help prevent folks because it's hard to say whether. Do damage they can't root it out or something that urged. An underlying issue our own or all of concussions. And yet she kicker by more than likely outlook soccer. And concussion can happen. In Antarctic on. All you'll make it did you make a connection though as soon as she started hitting you are. How did you make a catch. No because of the time calling that income was shot on the worker. It would show unlike her personality and piling up in just a couple of weeks after the lapse concussion and and and and it and I noted some bit of anger outrage before that I thought cash not like Kirk's and I talked to spectacular specialists. With concussion mortgage ear of how do we know everything is okay and she's the first thing that's that's where that was how about much and went oh my word. I'm not sure if I'm thank you for the call Michelle and I sure Toronto. Judge brown is involved in soccer soccer is a big issue concussions especially for girls receive all the time and basketball as well. But from what I understand Larry Josh Brown was abused. When he was young man and unfortunately the sad reality is those rarely used as children. Quite often become abusive as well that's why I asked immediately. If if the NF are really wants to do something not just put him. But get some counseling set up for his children and because these things usually repeat themselves at and exactly and it could be passed on the next generation sadly John in the car your next on Sports Radio WEEI. It got a giant itself. AM I just wanted to kind of you know make this a little bit of a broader goal in relation did domestic abuse speaker. You've got you know whether it. You know I think the end NFL had a responsibility but soldiers every. Sport in relation to this you know the NBA I mean India is just as bad in relation to that. Domestic abuse these guys do but if you go back and you look at. You know these kids come at your high school these these guys coming to college. Whether it's a legal incident with pitino. I mean it's you know no not really not a bad. Hang about that I wasn't enough today. That's one of them at one of those you know if it it bit if you don't know about it and happened at it and got them. But the thing is you know whether it's kids in you know there was a situation in Maine recently where kids got caught. Drink in that they were allowed to play in the playoff game you know what I mean and culture of entitlement that's who you're talking about John and basically it means you know you're not gonna. If anybody thinks with two seconds that the NFL some kind of a rule change in here it's gonna change people's attitude. That's ridiculous run at the start. It's the but it's but it's. Comes more you know little bit more global map I just think that. You know until we stop the it's hypocritical. You know this is a business and it's gonna continue to look out for its bottom line you'd think. Anybody go into Wal-Mart wilds of fact the divine you know close at Wal-Mart built me by eight you know child labor in. We're 75 cents a day now. Right in the thing isn't as you know but but people go in Asia and they still body. To how do you make up so how do you make. So John how do you make a difference. I think it just have to stop lit. You know a a no excuse. Punishment in other words you know when kids right from high school on the college and one not. They just have to you know and the story you know you know you get caught drinking and you get caught it with somebody get caught in some kind of you know thievery or some. Saying whatever whatever that whatever the best player on you team. Well that's the point is until. You know posters wanna allow it there until Ali's people pumping money into let me wanna allow it then you know you need to basically say look. We don't have it's its jeans and went and he's still up the team it doesn't matter it doesn't matter who it is. Our rules are rules but realistically. People don't wanna see that because. You know it's if if Tom Brady was caught do and so then they wouldn't want him out you know what I mean it's Eric you know Ben Roethlisberger any of these other soups. Well Roethlisberger was suspended for six games for lose contact. With the a young woman he remembered a bar a few years ago. And he was suspended six originally got that thing it reduced to four. Because again they didn't have enough evidence but it's a huge problem it goes beyond just the National Football League certainly domestic violence. Is endemic to all walks of life. Alcohol is a huge factor and as I said earlier alcohol is one of the main supporters economically of the National Football League in the interest thing. If Budweiser. But because of this or are other stories that come out decided to take their money out of the NFL. That would be a fascinating scenario disable these relatives. Resting as much as we would like other BC football program to be more successful. I think academically and otherwise I do think they trying keep a pretty decent standard over via. If for that reason it's how to to recruit top flight talent that these other teams Alabama or how these teams are do you think they get have these plays. No question about it here's a man with vastly no standards whatsoever with Mike in can't you're next on Sports Radio I'm react up up up. Don't. Mean yeah I haven't won a rating could drive a little bit different pay discriminating you guys are most of quote sing but. I think the debt is because it's over saturation. It's Sunday it's Sunday night its money United's third and headed London's Sunday morning you know it's too much. Yeah you know what it is in an IIAU prior retirement early matter princess has talked about earlier in the week it's Sunday night is the big is the big. Problem because it's it's the talk but over saturation you need nine hours of football. In this week it's even worse does he have a 930 games so that's twelve hours of football. And it's so funny like Obama outlined from Wall Street how many yachts can be awarded ski behind. Yeah an and that is Oakland water skiing courses up plot Xeon that ramp jumping the shark. And we may have a jumping the shark situation here. Yeah I mean it just yeah I think it was and I'd draw the line up to depart exactly what baseball they went up another ten box on the baseball package and told economic. I'm doing it and it is you have red zone. The red zone. Now and a red zone now that the Google jets the that you purport to be into that's quite a bit waited to outline. In its pocket spend money is all money right about that and it didn't light up exports but I. Here's the problem the beautiful boy used to be goes back to what you're saying about over saturation was because it was once a week it doesn't feel that way anymore doesn't. Now yet through much. Extra Jacksonville Indianapolis game and in the morning. Hey how about this yeah they haven't heard Michael all this year this week Jacksonville and Tennessee are all there is a must watch Beckett. Can you believe that. In Italy I just think they're old they've overdone it. And it because it did that that the suspect or are these well hopefully you guys said Lawrence Taylor thirty years ago I mean possibly going up forever. Right and they are propping him mopping and they found him on the Garden State Parkway passed out in the car and all kinds of crazy stuff out. When Allen incident didn't hurt the ratings. You know it started this year. Ray Rice let's not. Let's update reality that same rush yeah. And you know Ray Rice seemingly in sincerely sought counsel and tried to redeem himself but you know the I get the owners credit for this they'd never. Not one owner geared to employ Ray Rice after it was Jerry Brown they would have employed him now. Jimmy brown had his ownership rule not the door out the window and I know rabbit that was after his career was over. Guys I have to mention the Indians. I'll be outlawed that. People said it was a little when they beat the Red Sox and the leaders are gonna count. Only dispatched the blue jays and five easy pickings as well. There's you know there's something about it. And I think it took in the. Well I think there's something about a trade that happened somewhere and legs are a guy Ryan Miller now. I. Well we will you know it was interest in what is seen as the post had an article on this this week lot of pressure on those prospects. To make good with the Yankees after what restored and that apple. But as dominant as Miller was in three for three other teams he is in the east zones in zone right now that I never seemed. I think he was thought it would be expedited great imminent and that you know. In the sprint car it does the mavs looked at meaning people connecting to give the other day two games actually. Born five. Did you see that. As much of the Red Sox as we're seeing now with the Indians is he is he operating a whole different level now yeah it does the payroll because he has that ES to make more of last. Yeah yeah and and the red barrel and everybody gets that far but I didn't happen these guys in the bullpen. There wanting everybody jumping ship over there. Where were attacked. They lost the a young kid going to be that general manager around and Arizona aren't there any losses thirteen year. Talent scout they had epic. Out. You know I hope we doesn't bat an accident this year W look who's left right now of the three play off teams game six tonight in Chicago and get Ager in Gonzales who. Anthony resolved. Broke okra Coke were asked Andrew Miller Tito Branko why can't we get players like that unless their job okay. It. Yeah all right let's go play were younger adult pop tarts you missed 177797937. Final segment in the mustard and Johnson show coming up. I. The that. They sneeze mosque in Johnson Sports Radio. Point seven. Did you try that bullet that team have a try to talk to the wife and no not at all. As my friends sets interviewing. Princess he tried to say interviewing John marathoner of the giants couple days ago after the hole. Josh brawn brown situation exploded. Must be nice to have all that money though you really don't have to give it time when people think you really don't reserve offered Sessler American Mara any of the NFL owners should make EO and got so much money who equaled if you don't care and you know Larry and the giants you know were the first team. To have that long waiting list you know they pass along. Generation to generation those season tickets down there and exit sixteen W. And they no matter what the product is they're gonna sell out every single. Game it's impossible to get tickets whether the giants are good mediocre or Super Bowl bound. That audience is always gonna remain. Very very loyal self. How much attention do you have to pay to the public that too is the question 6177797937. John your next on Sports Radio they just paid Iran. Oh thank you. I certainly wouldn't have a one don't wanna lift it up all optical kick of the early intervention is one of the most important things and musicians. But I just wanted to mention you know that's not conduct so I knew by the way you four you've got a number great calls one on this. This is one of many societal ills we have you know hybrid called parent. And I've been looking up today but in the aftermath of the over Ray Rice stuff farm one of the things government online at a guided to study these shoulder with. Surprising results that the athletes in and some that may be good points about the entitlement and enablement they get along the way but. If you looked at the demographics and the agents involved and so what they're worth that much out alliance. In some of these issues. Well they don't want their they're very well page but very immature young man who lived in a culture of privileged and entitlement their entire lives. Oh question. It Craig you mentioned. Perhaps you misspoke grow and Adam and in the picked it abroad alcohol being the cause. It's a big one up more often than not. Well John I know you're recovering alcoholic. But you would admit that alcohol is responsible for a lot of domestic violence would you not agree. I would say it's an ingredient that orbit. I mean put it this way people with alcoholism on all domestic abuse. Not I'm not saying at all and or you know when I think of I would say that it's great it's a good. Hi measures did you question bridal question you know I didn't look at the stats and that was shooting from the hip plan to stand out. And I and I would in an agreement with that when I think most people we get. Address the sub issue. Will deal with the demands that the final solution was well I mean you get into domestic buys power and control and so forth where you can like as I said the NFL bit. The earliest you can happen in my in my state alcohol. And into maybe caller worked in treatment in the and that in prison site. Nobody ever got told that I know of things going good. You know what I mean variety way things should the fan in people's lives. And it can sometimes just a question of you know you get sick of looking in the mirror and I'm sure that happens with domestic violence faults but visually some sort of an intervention. And equally fed intervention can happen and that's where the giants struck the ball. The early in the treatment hopefully can begin there's no excuse to the end of all the money they have can't shoot doesn't happen in maybe they do I don't know. They should have stayed at the out education. Intervention. And treatment programs available to those guys covenant the lead. In the early of the one can identify these issues and problems. Pete Earley if they can be addressed. They identified it but what they did is immediately in what it is this is their default response John. Copper op that's always the default response they hired three Werman who at least they're free Al Jane ran down in Rita Smith and on these women were supposed to have. Import and some control over how the NFL was Ghana. You would such matters and I haven't heard from many of them. Right. One left side and you're right time. To a two picture. Point should happen and one of them the lost the brother which is. Hugely serious the other was minor league and comparison that was lost the job. I had a lot of enablement allowing them to roll was my alcoholism. And final pieces up my brother's death six months Trulia I finally got enablement and did I had a new dimension and I got passed by it. And that put me on the path that was the last thing that made the white flag what can be. So without that kind of an intervention journals how much longer would've gone and they go would run somebody go with America. Or whatever but there's got to beat anybody they can identify an issue have to intervene and do something about it and hope that the person committed just the issue. We're glad you're okay now. Appreciated John. 12 areas Daniels then what's going market. I have no choice to be quick you know typically Craig I think the ratings it down. In September football anyways because people it's still trying to hang on to some are now being good need for this week notwithstanding. So I mean I can only speak for myself that many oddities with you about 1 o'clock games right. Want to be I don't wanna be sit there and I wanna go I don't get Comcast also will be agent. By the way Danny believe it or not we having this discussion much are friends of mine last night and you'll tell me how much they love sports 45 games. And I said you know what I argue would Danny from Quincy all about this I still like the 1 o'clock in the. Do we Greenwood and really like for five to Munich because that went so quick you know what I haven't got six months of begging went to common way I want to stay at what do you wanna target and last week was a perfect example and I want it to the I was gay but you know. So that the Bible out. The patriots are a lot of clocks in getting it on fox opposite damn you get off the table on CB that's what was Kansas City Auckland. I want and at least policy analyst that was terrible quote. The government forcing the giants' talent and picture on Nancy market to media didn't campuses in the opening game. But don't forget and don't forget now they get to get up tomorrow morning for the giant rams game. Yeah I got one minute. You don't have the right place. You know what happens is it spinach again you don't question it would play because it would make it competitive yes yes. Yeah asks the paper hadn't had any situation it would speed up at some problems and that I didn't lightest contact. And they don't yet know. Danny I don't want to mail then I want time I want competition Danny. I guess I think it's important cynical about ninety. It can easily. I want it just like usually go out get the best POP3 humans yet and not idiotic any I want competition all right we're getting away and don't then that T and T team is coming up trying to eat and Tomas it's new it's sensation here it's which radio.

Yahoo has the bad fortune that its bread and butter, online display ads, have dropped in price. While native and video ads have replaced this somewhat, Google and Facebook have as much as two-thirds of online ad revenue. According to Bloomberg: Google, the leading Internet search provider, and Facebook, the biggest social network operator, claimed 64 percent of that revenue, according to Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser. Google scooped up $30 billion and Facebook gathered $8 billion, while other smaller companies lost market share, the analyst noted. Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) had 205 million unique visitors. Following that is Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) with 192 million unique visitors. This includes MSN and visits to Microsoft company sites. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), the online retail company, sits next at 184 million unique visitors. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) is well down the list in 22nd place, with 93 million unique visitors. It, and the revenue it gets online, show something of the wall that Wal-Mart has to climb. Two media properties are next: CBS Interactive from CBS Corp. (NYSE: CBS) at 168 million and Comcast Corp.’s (NASDAQ: CMCSA) NBCUniversal at 163 million. This includes all visitors to the cable, broadcast and studio sites, and gives some idea of why AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) would want Time Warner Inc. (NYSE: TWX), the sites of which are broken into pieces. Turner Digital, the largest of them, had unique visitors of 132 million. Behind CBS and Comcast, AOL, a division of Verizon, has 158 million. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is next at 153 million. Among social media companies, LinkedIn Corp. (NYSE: LNKD) had 124 million, Twitter Inc. (NYSE: TWTR) 113 million and Pinterest 98 million. Mode Media, which closed in September, had 93 million unique visitors, which shows how little raw audience means. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Douglas A.

Council has begun the process to create a new bylaw that will prevent grocery stores in the district from taking advantage of the provincial government’s offer to allow wine sales in local markets. Mission Mayor Randy Hawes asked staff on Monday night to prepare a bylaw that restricts any liquor outlet from being within one kilometre of another. The move would eliminate all grocery stores in the district from selling alcohol. “This keeps liquor in the existing retail outlets and liquor is sold in a liquor-only type business,” said Hawes. In April 2015, the provincial government announced sales of B.C. wine at grocery stores would begin, starting with a Save-On-Foods in Surrey. The new system allows grocery stores to apply to use privately held liquor licences, in order to sell B.C. wine. Grocery stores are considered to be establishments that predominately sell groceries. The system excludes “super stores,” mixed-use stores like Walmart, and convenience stores. Pitt Meadows, Maple Ridge and North Vancouver all recently voted to create similar bylaws. The decision by Mission council to create the new bylaw came after a presentation by Bert Hick of Rising Tide Consultants. He was joined by at least 30 employees of existing beer and wine stores who were against allowing grocery stores to sell alcohol. Hick told council that allowing expanded wines sales will have a major impact on small liquor store owners and create more harm on the social side. “The more available you make alcohol, the greater the social costs resulting from alcohol,” he said. “When you think of alcohol access, you think of minors, you think of intoxicated persons, accidents, domestic violence – you have to consider the whole package,” Hick added. Hick believes the current model of alcohol sales should be maintained and not expanded. He noted there should always be a separation between grocery products and liquor. “Everyone has to go to the grocery store,” he said, adding having alcohol on the shelf, “next to the pickles,” can create a negative situation. With liquor stores and cold beer and wine stores, “the only reason to cross the threshold is to buy alcohol,” Hick said. Hawes said he proposed the new bylaw restrictions because he could not see any benefit to selling wine in grocery stores. “I know what the deficit is to Mission taxpayers if some of the private liquor stores are forced to close. But I don’t know what benefit there will be.” Council will vote on the bylaw at a future meeting.   We encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

Bortner / Published: October 22, 2016 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     A Carbon County man went to prison Friday after a Schuylkill County judge sentenced him in an August 2015 case from Rush Township. Alexander J. Modawar Sr., 36, of Lansford, must serve three to 18 months in prison under the terms of Judge James P. Goodman’s sentence. Goodman imposed the sentence after revoking Modawar’s probation, which the defendant admitted violating. Modawar originally pleaded guilty on May 18 to receiving stolen property, with prosecutors withdrawing a charge of retail theft. At that time, Goodman sentenced Modawar to spend 23 months on probation and pay costs, $50 to the Criminal Justice Enhancement Account and $96.26 restitution, amounts he still must pay under the terms of Friday’s sentence. Rush Township police charged Modawar with committing his crime on Aug. 6, 2015, at the Wal-Mart Supercenter, 35 Plaza Drive, Hometown. Also in the county court, Samuel Sanabria-Sanabria, 41, of Shenandoah, pleaded guilty to driving under the influence, with prosecutors withdrawing a charge of disorderly conduct. Judge Charles M. Miller accepted the plea and sentenced the defendant to serve three to 24 months in a state correctional institution, pay costs, a $500 fine, $100 to the Substance Abuse Education Fund, a $50 CJEA payment and $120 restitution to Lehigh Valley Hospital-Schuylkill S. Jackson Street, perform 30 hours community service and submit a DNA sample to law enforcement authorities. Shenandoah police said that Sanabria-Sanabria was DUI on Aug. 17, 2015, in the borough. In another county court case, Steven C. Peiffer, 36, of Pittsburgh, pleaded guilty to charges of burglary and theft in one case and receiving stolen property in another case. Prosecutors withdrew one additional count each of theft and receiving stolen property, along with charges of criminal trespass and criminal mischief. President Judge William E. Baldwin accepted the plea and sentenced Peiffer to serve 21 to 42 months in a state correctional institution, pay costs and $387 restitution, and submit a DNA sample to law enforcement authorities. Pottsville police charged Peiffer with receiving stolen property on Dec. 21, 2014, in the city, while state police at Schuylkill Haven charged him with committing the burglary and theft on Jan. 24, 2015, in West Brunswick Township.

I’m of course not talking about the week when a Salman Khan film releases and the IQ of human beings worldwide is brought down; I speak of the Mumbai Film Festival, Jio MAMI 2016, which is not only a week long balm to everything terrible about Bollywood, but also a week long celebration of how good cinema can be. Like every year the 18th Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival kicked off to a disappointing start and faced some of the same problems it does every single year. The online booking system backfired in a big way, angering many hyperactive film buffs. Those who wanted to watch The Salesman and Personal Shopper on Day 2 were in for a rude shock as the booking page behaved like the made in China parts of the space ship in Armageddon. The page failed to load for almost an hour and when it did show up the tickets were mysteriously gone in 60 seconds. Some who didn’t get a ticket to Asghar Farhadi’s The Salesman were angry, some wept uncontrollably, and some even hinted a conspiracy theory that MAMI is deliberately not giving away online tickets because they’re selling them for black in a bylane of Mira Road whispering ‘dus ka tees’. A still from Asghar Farhadi's The Salesman. Image from Facebook. Some compared the goof and this booking system to the Indian Railway’s Tatkal scheme, which was kind of unfair but given their enthusiasm had been quashed it was a predictable reaction from angsty people on the internet. Those who had the common sense to not waste time complaining on the internet rushed to the venues still wearing their pajamas, or in some cases, still dripping in soap foam and clad in bathroom towels, and promptly booked tickets of the films. Keeping a certain percentage of offline tickets is actually a good initiative by MAMI, so those without access to the internet can also get to watch the films they want. I chose both the Andheri venues, because no self respecting film buff would go to any part of Bombay for a cinema based pilgrimage other than the Walmart of struggling filmmakers that is Versova. The biggest improvement at the fest this year is the speed at which your pass is issued to you. Thanks to the perfectly trained folks behind the counter it look less than a minute to grab my pass and head straight to the movies. This was a nice change from last year when I’d stood in line for an hour and missed a film. At the venue I got to know about the offline tickets that can be bought right at the counter. With the hope that I could still nab a ticket to The Salesman I went back downstairs to the ticket window, where they informed me that I could only get the tickets upstairs. I then rushed back upstairs and got caught in a line that reminded me of the scene in Black Hawk Down where destitute Somalian citizens fight over food packets being thrown at them by the US army. Since I didn’t carry a machete to cut my way through I naturally didn’t score a ticket, and I had to drown my sorrows by buying a gigantic ‘breakup éclair’ at Dunkin donuts. As I chewed away wiping my tears I was left with the thought that there are people in Bombay who would kill someone else to watch The Salesman; and that even if a small percentage of this much enthusiasm was shown by Indian producers to make films like The Salesman, our film industry would be such a different place. After picking up a ridiculously priced multiplex sandwich I was ready to watch the films. After the Storm, the new film from Hirokazu Koreeda was, much like his earlier films, quite lovely. The film dealt with themes already explored in Koreeda’s Like Father Like Son, like an estranged father trying to make amends with his son and ex wife, the alienation one experiences in Japanese work culture and the loss of what is most important in the contemporary world but is getting increasingly difficult to sustain – a family life. Though not quite memorable as Koreeada’s earlier work this was still an enjoyable little film mainly thanks to a likable performance from Hiroshi Abe as a struggling novelist gambling addict private detective all in one. The documentary The Lovers and the Despot chronicled a pretty crazy real life story of two South Korean film personalities kidnapped and brought to North Korea and forced to make films for Dear Leader Kim Jong Il. It’s the kind of story you expect from a Family Guy episode but the fact that this actually happened to someone makes your skin crawl. The film does a good job of telling you how things went down but it never really lives up to its potential, mainly due to the utter lack of access to the point of view of the Dear Leader himself. Still, this was a mildly memorable peek into the nightmarish dictatorial subhuman conditions in the darkest pocket of the planet that is North Korea. A still from Polish film The Lure. Image from Facebook. Depression hit like a ton of bricks with Ralitza Petrova’s Godless, a Bulgarian film set in a remote Bulgarian town that could easily be the most dismal and bleak place on Earth. The film follows a nurse whose terrible life revolves only around tending to elderly patients, being involved in an ID scam, suffering in a sexless marriage and taking drugs that still don’t make her happy. The film is a fascinating window into post-Zhivkov Bulgaria and is packed with a really hard-hitting point that nothing has changed since dictatorship ended. But the amount of suffering and unpleasantness showcased in the film that is not for one moment redeemed is just too much to not make it seem like a manipulative piece of cinema. It’s well directed and hauntingly scored but the over the top nature of its sordidness does disservice to the actual problems it is trying to address. The best of the day was saved for the last, as the Polish film The Lure turned out to be a trippy, severely entertaining punk rock musical about siren vampire mermaids who are hired as songstresses in a Polish nightclub. The film is consistently weird and flows like a mixtape of Nouvalle Vague songs ranging from heartache pop to feverish disco, wonderfully interspersed with ridiculously sexy women, gore and a fairy tale like love story. Also interesting are the metaphorical aspects of the club and the mermaids who represent immigrants exploited by Poland on their way to make it in America.

As of the end of September, building permit valuation had surpassed totals for the previous seven years, at $96.5 million. Routt County construction industry hits biggest permit valuation in 7 years: $96.5 million By Tom Ross Saturday, October 22, 2016 Share this Email, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn Discuss 5 comments Advertisement Steamboat Springs  The 2016 construction season can’t match the drama of 2007 and 2008, when some of the largest multi-family residential projects at Steamboat Ski Area began to come out of the ground. However, it may prove to be a watershed year. Fueled by 13 $1 million home starts, numerous six-figure remodels and a handful of big ticket institutional building projects, this construction season is putting up numbers like the Yampa Valley hasn’t seen since the boom years of almost a decade ago. Expressed in terms of the valuation of building permits, Routt County Chief Building Official Ben Grush confirmed this month that through the end of September, this year’s construction industry is $20 million ahead of 2015, with total permit valuation of $96.5 million. That’s easily the most bullish number since 2009. Katie Berning/staff “I see this as being a reasonable level of growth,” Grush said. “This year’s been a little challenging, more so than the last several. But I think this is creating job opportunities and business opportunities from design professionals all the way through to suppliers.” His department has conducted more than 4,000 inspections this year. The construction rebound is also putting stress on general contractors as they compete for the attention of subcontractors they need to show up on time to keep their projects on schedule. The problem is the electricians, plumbers, dry-wallers, painters and tile setters they rely upon are in short supply. The roster of skilled subcontractors who understand the challenge of building in the mountains was depleted by the ravages of the Great Recession, with many relocating to distant markets, as Routt County lagged the recovery nationwide. General contractor Tom Dover, who came to Steamboat in 2003 in the midst of a 25-year career, said the construction industry is as busy as it’s ever been here, but it’s not all good news. “It’s killing it right now, everybody is so busy,” Dover said. “Even in 2007, it wasn’t like this. Well, it probably was this busy in 2007, but I don’t think we have the workforce to handle it now.” Dover is in the middle of building four $1 million-plus homes — “Houses below a million are few and far between,” he said — and for the first time in his career here, he said he’s going to miss on the promise of a move-in date. “I have clients who are supposed to move in Thanksgiving week,” he said. “Since 1993, I’ve never missed a move in, but I’m going to miss this one. I had to tell my clients, ‘Guys, I’m fighting an uphill battle. I can only push so hard. You’ll get in a couple of weeks late.’” Dover acknowledged that subcontractors are being stretched thin, but he said though they charge top dollar here, they aren’t the only reason building costs are so high. “It’s not just the subs,” he said. “It’s as much materials. Lumber is up, it’s a commodity and it’s in high demand. Plywood, OSB (oriented strand board) and two-by-fours have gone through the roof.” Realtor Tom Valicenti of Colorado Group Realty attributed the challenge of securing subcontractors to supply and demand. “The price of new construction has risen for many reasons but during the recession we lost a good percentage of our work force that relocated to find construction work in the Denver area where work was plentiful,” he said. “So our current craftsman have limited availability and have adjusted their prices accordingly.” Where the valuation is The city of Steamboat has accounted for $66.5 million in permit valuation so far this year and $24 million is attributable to single-family home construction, Grush said. Commercial projects include the $700,000 remodel of the Walmart store, the new $2.03 million building on the United Methodist Church campus, a $3.89 million permit for the expansion at Yampa Valley Medical Center and $7.89 million combined for the two buildings in The Reserves affordable apartments being developed by the Overland Property Group. Single-family projects in the county (excluding Hayden, which has its own building department) account for $23 million of the total of the overall $30 million in permit valuation. “Those are mostly builds on (parcels) 35 acres and up in the county,” Grush said. “There have been maybe a half dozen houses in Steamboat, Silver Spur (and Heritage Park).” Scarce building lots fuel remodel trend If there’s a concern looming just over the horizon, it might be the scarcity of building lots in the city and close-in rural subdivisions. Ulrich Salzgeber, executive director of the Steamboat Springs Board of Realtors, said he turned up 85 lots on the multiple listing service, but that number includes larger acreages in the countryside close to Steamboat. When one searches the website of one of the real estate brokerages here, there are only 11 building lots priced between $260,000 and $370,000 in the city proper, and the asking prices go up from there. The lowest-priced building lot in the city is a shallow .26-acre lot on Apres Ski Way with an asking price of $195,000. That’s a problem. Katie Berning/staff Realtor Tom Valicenti confirmed supply is dwindling even though the local market has seen a great deal of sales and spec home construction in the Barn Village subdivision just east of Pine Grove Road and in Greystone on the Green perched above Rollingstone Golf Course. “With new home construction running between $275 and $450 per square foot depending on finishes and architecture, many buyers are turning to remodeling an older home that they purchased for less per square foot than new construction would cost,” Valicenti said. Grush pointed out that in addition to lower costs per square foot, remodelers also realize value in the fact that the utilities are already extended to the house, and a significant number of tap fees, which can add up fast, have already been paid. Grush believes that aesthetics are also driving the trend toward remodels — affluent buyers who are looking for homes in Steamboat have an expectation that they will have a dramatic view out the window of their great room. When they can’t find a suitable lot that offers a mountain view, they are more inclined to look at an existing home that doesn’t meet their expectations but does sit on a view lot. Realtor Nick Metzler confirmed that trend. Photo by Tom Ross Crews working for Haselden Construction were completing exterior finishes and installing landscaping outside the new addition to Yampa Valley Medical Center this month. The $3.89 million building permit valuation for this summer's work at the hospital contributed to a total permit valuation for Routt County and Steamboat Springs of $96.5 million through the end of September. “After driving people around Steamboat for 25 years, I’ve found that for 80 percent of them, four out of five, the view is going to be in the top three items they are looking at in a home,” he said. Valicenti said inevitably, as homebuyers continue to take advantage of the remodel option, those prices too will rise. “With fewer available lots on the market, this trend should continue until the price of resale homes becomes too high to make good financial sense to buyers and homeowners,” he said.  Metzler said the scarcity of existing single-family homes under $600,000 and the age of those homes is also a factor in current trends. Among the 11 single-family homes in the city limits priced under $600,000, the average asking price per square foot is $408, he said. “The kicker is that the average of these 11 homes is 50-plus years,” Metzler said. “And only three of them have a two-car garage.” Salzgeber pointed out the longstanding rule of thumb, that the construction value of a house should be about three times the value of the lot. That means a $250,000 building lot implies a $1 million construction project. At $300 dollars per square foot, a modestly sized home of 2,300 square feet would add up to $690,000 for the structure on top of $250,000, or $940,000. Metzler said buyers’ thinking on balancing lot costs with building costs is evolving, particularly on the higher end, as homebuyers increase their emphasis on efficient homes. High-end buyers are increasingly willing to build a smaller, more efficient home on a large estate lot. It goes without saying there are still people in Routt County who want to build a home for less than $1 million. But their options are shrinking significantly and may lie to the south in unincorporated Stagecoach and to the west in ready-to-build subdivisions in Hayden. Metzler and his partners in the Sunlight subdivision on an elevated parcel with views of the ski area above the north side of U.S. Highway 40 between the community center and the stoplight at Elk River Road, hope to release the first 40 lots in the 92-lot subdivision in 2017. Pricing isn’t available yet, but Metzler said they will soon establish a formal process allowing buyers/builders to reserve one of the first 20 lots in Sunlight. The intent, he said, is to allow buyers to begin the planning process for a new home in advance of going to contract and closing next year. ‘We then will release another 20 lots by mid-summer, if not sooner,” Metzler said. “Sunlight will have some custom homes and also new homes built for sale next summer.” A rare species One of the lessons the Steamboat Springs/Routt County community took from the Great Recession was that many of the people intent on purchasing reasonably priced family homes were people working in the housing industry themselves. They were plumbing contractors, people selling custom-cut granite countertops, installing hardwood flooring, designing and installing custom kitchens, and on and on. But not as many of those skilled people live here as once did, and the housing market has been evolving in the meantime. Looking ahead to retirement, Dover is developing 10 live-work units in Cooper Ridge, with an eye on housing construction workers for other contractors. “All my subs are complaining they have nowhere to house employees,” Dover said. “My plumbing contractor had a guy from Kansas, who was very good, but after a few months he left. He couldn’t get a house. Really good workers are making $30 an hour … if you’re a kid with no bills that’s great. But if you’re an adult, you can’t survive.” Dover isn’t certain where the upward spiral of building costs will end. “I don’t know where it’s headed,” he said. “There’s no labor force. Is there going to be one? Not as long as the cost of living is as high as it is.” Valicenti suggested construction is challenging throughout the mountain towns. “When looking at most world class resort markets, Steamboat fares very well in determining good value with competing ski areas,” he said.

Upvote 0 Post reply Please Login and/or Verify your account to reply Sign in to suggest removal Scott Wedel 3 weeks, 2 days ago Eric, Million dollar houses are not being financed by exceptional leverage as if a bubble. Interest rates are low, but the flip side is that it is historically difficult to qualify for loans. Banks have high liquidity requirements so they are greatly limited in their ability to lend. Thus, buyers are bringing a large amount of cash to the table when buying million dollar houses and the part that is financed has a long term fixed interest loan. So their monthly payment is fixed to what they can afford. Thus, this does not look like a bubble that can result in a price collapse and numerous foreclosures when there is an economic downtown. Though, it is certainly plausible that higher end housing prices could decline, particularly if interest rates increase. I also note that while SB is doing well building million dollar housing, there is no housing boom for what might house the subcontractors or other parts of the workforce in better jobs. That is where loans are harder to get and government regulations such as tap fees and building codes with ever more requirements keep ratcheting up construction costs. I think we should seriously consider enacting 1990 building codes and tossing all of the stuff since then. Buildings constructed in the 80s are not falling over or causing great problems. At some point, the quality of the product should be up to the free market consumer and not specified by government. It makes particularly little sense to constantly add requirements to new construction without requiring similar retrofits to existing buildings. If the item is so beneficial, such as smoke alarms, then it is required in existing buildings, not just new construction.

I'm not relying on a Mises Institute scholar here. http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/06/04/the-feds-zero-rate-policy-boosts-inequality-nobel-economist-joseph-stiglitz-says/ Upvote 0 Post reply Please Login and/or Verify your account to reply Sign in to suggest removal Scott Wedel 3 weeks, 1 day ago I think that historically that low interest rates have helped a larger swath of the population by allowing them to benefit from leverage in rising housing prices and borrow money to open a small business. Our current zero interest policy may be historically unique in that money is inexpensive for those with assets, but unavailable to most of the population. Currently, if you want FHA financing for building apartments then they want two years of rental income. So a builder would have to float the project for two years. Thus, wealthy people are able to use their existing assets to borrow at low interest rates. Meanwhile, members of the rest of the population can be smart enough to see great opportunities, but have no hopes of getting low interest rate financing. This region is setting up to have a shortage of service workers to rival SF or NYC. With the new building codes likely to be approved and the challenges of financing, any new housing supply including apts is going to need tenants making $50K a year to live in Hayden or Oak Creek. Going to need $75K annually to live in new apts in SB. I suppose taxpayers can spend over $200K per apt in subsidies to create local "workforce" housing as YVHA is doing at Elk River. If we just double city taxes to create a local government agency building affordable housing able to almost keep up with local demand.

(Photo: Bryon Houlgrave/The Register)Buy Photo Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton masks and scary clown costumes might be top of mind for many Halloween revelers this year, but superheroes rule the holiday in central Iowa. For the first time in 11 years, sales of Ironman, Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and other superhero costumes for children have outpaced the ever-popular princess outfits, said Ryan Oshel, manager of the Wal-Mart store in Windsor Heights. Their popularity has been boosted by omnipresent movie and video releases featuring comic book icons, Oshel said. U.S. shoppers will dole out more this year on Halloween costumes, candy and decorations — an average of $82.93 a person, compared with $74.34 last year, according to the National Retail Federation. Halloween sales are expected to top $8.4 billion, albeit still a fraction of the $656 billion that shoppers are expected to spend for the winter holidays this year. Even so, the interest in finding that perfect Halloween costume is leading to strong sales around the area. The Theatrical Shop in Valley Junction shopping district has been getting plenty of requests for masks bearing the likeness of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, said Kathy Harkrader, store manager. The masks run $20 to $30, she said. “The Hillary sales are more than the Trump, but I don’t know why,” mused Harkrader, adding that Clinton and Trump wigs also are popular.

The annual pop-up shops this year are in the former Sports Authority store in West Des Moines’ Water Tower Place shopping center and at Merle Hay Mall in Des Moines. “Sales are down so far this year, and I think it has a little bit to do with people being preoccupied with the elections, and the warm weather,” Bryan Olesen said last week.

The incidents recently prompted Target Corp. to pull some of the creepy clown masks from their shelves.

The Campfields grow all of the products they sell, including gourds, decorative pumpkins, pie pumpkins, squash, corn stalks, Indian corn, straw and mums. New this year is the demand for jumbo pumpkins weighing about 150 pounds that sell for $40, Campfield said. Buyers are using them to decorate the outside of their homes, she said. As soon as the Halloween hocus pocus has vanished, the Christmas creep will be in full force.

Hillary Clinton proposes making tuition free for many students at public colleges. Donald Trump would expand limits on how much borrowers have to pay back each month. But what about those already holding debt? We take a look as part of our series How the Deck Is Stacked, funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, in partnership with “Frontline” and Marketplace. Marketplace’s Lizzie O’Leary has the first of two stories. LIZZIE O’LEARY: If everything had gone according to plan, Chris Savelle would be on Wall Street right now, not biking through downtown Detroit in a free weekly community ride. Savelle, who is 31, graduated into the teeth of the recession. He’s got $100,000 in student loan debt on his mind. What does $100,000 feel like? CHRIS SAVELLE, Student Borrower: It sucks. LIZZIE O’LEARY: Jessica Love Jordan is in a similar situation. She started college late and is now working on finishing her master’s in addiction counseling. She juggles school, work and being a single parent. Sometimes, the debt feels too much. JESSICA LOVE JORDAN, Student Borrower: Now and again, when I look at the statement, and see how much I actually have to pay back, it’s almost suffocating. I have those fleeing thoughts, you know what, let me just stop now, and go work, so I can be able to live later on in life. LIZZIE O’LEARY: When she graduates, she can expect to make about $33,000 annually as an addiction counselor. Her debt will be about $90,000. The median student debt is much lower than Savelle or Love Jordan’s, about $27,000. But their experiences are similar to those of many students who attended state universities at a time when their budgets were being cut, and as the great recession hit. The money for school had to come from somewhere, in most cases, students. Where did you think you would be in your life at 31? CHRIS SAVELLE: Go work for an investment firm or hedge fund, Chicago, New York, something like that. LIZZIE O’LEARY: But when Savelle graduated in 2008, the best job he could find was at a local Wal-Mart. He’s recovered somewhat now. He works as a supply chain engineer, and supports his mother and sister. Temple University Professor Sara Goldrick-Rab has been researching the rising price of college for years. How has the aid picture changed as median incomes have stagnated, really, for the last 20 years? SARA GOLDRICK-RAB, Temple University: The sticker price on a per student basis has gone up a lot, while the amount of financial aid on a per student basis has gone down. So, the result is that the net price, the amount that the families actually pay out of their pocket, is rising, and it’s rising fairly rapidly. LIZZIE O’LEARY: More than 40 million Americans have student loan debt. The total amount is around $1.3 trillion. Even so, there are experts like Sandy Baum, who studies student debt at the Urban Institute, and says only certain people are being hurt. SANDY BAUM, Urban Institute: Student debt is a crisis for some people, but student debt is not the generalized crisis that the common discourse would make it appear. Yes, people are paying more of their incomes for a college education, but still it’s worth it for most people. It’s still a very good investment for most people, but not for everyone. LIZZIE O’LEARY: Sara Goldrick-Rab says far too many people are being saddled with substantial debt. You wrote that debt is a symptom, not the disease. It sounds like you think the disease is the high price. SARA GOLDRICK-RAB: The disease is the price. And we have a problem, where people are being priced out of college, and in their effort to not be priced out, they’re taking on debt that, frankly, they’re going to have real trouble repaying. LIZZIE O’LEARY: People like Jordan Hoeft. He’s been trying to get a more manageable payment plan. He studied film, but couldn’t get a job in the industry. He now owes $100,000 in private student loans, but was paying interest only until recently. He lives at home in the Chicago suburbs with his parents. They already were tapped out after helping his siblings with loans. So Jordan’s parents asked his grandparents to co-sign. And when his debt piled up, the loan servicer came calling. MELODI HOEFT, Jordan’s Mother: My father co-signed for some of the kids’ loans after Patrick and I were tapped out on signing, co-signing for them. My father passed away, and within 60 days of my dad passing away, the private student loan venders were calling my mom, harassing her, wanting her to pay the balance in full. LIZZIE O’LEARY: The whole thing? MELODI HOEFT: The whole balance, and that he — they were not in arrears at all. My mom called me crying, saying, “I don’t have that money and they want me to pay this loan.” And I said, oh, no. LIZZIE O’LEARY: She must have been terrified? MELODI HOEFT: She was hysterical. LIZZIE O’LEARY: Jordan Hoeft’s loans are serviced by Navient, which spun off from Sallie Mae, and now owns its student debt business. It is one of the nation’s largest student debt servicers. The company handles both private and federal loans. Hoeft’s loans are private, not federal, and had a high interest rate. JORDAN HOEFT, Student Borrower: So, I told them, almost as a joke, I said, I can either have you guys lower my payments, so I can make rent, and then pay you, or I can live in my truck and make the full payments to you every month. And the woman on the phone, dead serious, told me, “I don’t want to tell you to have to live in your truck, but you might have to live in your truck.” LIZZIE O’LEARY: We asked Navient about that phone call, and they told us — quote — “Our representative sympathizes with Mr. Hoeft, and the two establish a rapport in which she dismisses his facetious comment that he may need to live in his car. Our representative didn’t urge him to live in his car. Rather, she encourages him to consider a practical option, such as finding a roommate to split expenses.” Jordan and his mother decided to do something about how they were being treated by their servicer and reached out to their state’s top law enforcement officer. LISA MADIGAN, Attorney General, Illinois: I have seen an increasing number of fraud complaints from current and former higher education students. LIZZIE O’LEARY: Lisa Madigan is the attorney general for Illinois. After noticing a rise in complaints against companies involved in higher education, Madigan filed lawsuits against several for-profit schools. Now she is leading a multistate investigation into Navient. Why did you decide to look at Navient? LISA MADIGAN: It was the volume of complaints that we received and the serious nature of them. We have looked at over 5,000 complaints, we have listened to over 800 phone calls, and we have been able to determine that, time and time again, the servicers are not providing borrowers with their repayment options. LIZZIE O’LEARY: The majority of student loans are federal and originate with the Department of Education, but they’re contracted out to a handful of companies who manage the payments. It’s a $140 billion industry annually, and servicers, like Navient, make about $2 billion in commission per year. LISA MADIGAN: Most of the time, what they do if someone is struggling is, they will put them into a forbearance, which is not necessarily going to be the best thing for that borrower in the long run, certainly not going to make that debt any more manageable. In fact, it will often tend to grow that debt. LIZZIE O’LEARY: There are several ways to reduce monthly payments. Deferment or forbearance temporarily postpones payments, but interest may continue to accrue while payments are on hold. For federal loans, there are several income-based repayment options, where a borrower pays a portion of their discretionary income, from 10 percent down to zero if they’re unemployed. Madigan thinks servicers are pushing borrowers into forbearance. LISA MADIGAN: Unfortunately, the way it ends up working out is, it’s good for the servicer, because they’re incentivized through their compensation to get people through the process, but it is bad for the borrower, which is ultimately bad for that person’s family and bad for our overall economy. LIZZIE O’LEARY: Navient declined to comment directly on Madigan’s investigation and instead sent this statement: “Navient is a leader in enrolling eligible borrowers into income-driven repayment programs. We have been strong advocates for streamlining the enrollment process to make it easier for borrowers.” “PBS NewsHour” requested an interview with the Department of Education. It declined. The department pointed us to this policy memo suggesting servicers provide better information to borrowers, but any changes, if approved, wouldn’t take effect until 2019. Borrowers like Jordan Hoeft may never see any changes. Seth Frotman of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau says his agency is tracking complaints. The agency has started monitoring many key financial players, including loan service companies. SETH FROTMAN, Consumer Finance Protection Bureau: And there’s an amazing government audit that found that 70 percent of federal student loan borrowers in default, so have defaulted on their loans, were actually eligible for an income-generated payment plan as low as zero dollars. I think that’s an abysmal failure. And I think that’s a direct implication of student loan servicers and the oversight over student loan servicers. LIZZIE O’LEARY: The borrowers most likely to default? Those with $10,000 or less in student loans. They have lower debt, but are less likely to have completed their degrees and may have lower earnings. Chris Savelle’s debt has affected his little sister’s future as well. If it weren’t for Chris’ debt, do you think Katie would be in a four-year school now? JAN SAVELLE, Chris Savell’s Mother: I think she would. I think if she could see that she could get an education without having a lifetime of crushing debt, I think she would. LIZZIE O’LEARY: The legacy of Chris Savelle’s debt will be with him, his sister and his whole generation long after it’s paid. For the “PBS NewsHour,” this is Lizzie O’Leary in Detroit JUDY WOODRUFF: In our next piece, the impact of debt on some students at for-profit schools. And, online, we look at which student loan companies accrue the most complaints by borrowers.

(Dougal Brownlie/The St. Joseph News-Press via AP) Trey Cocking, the city manager of Atchison, Kan., addresses the media after a chemical incident occurred at the MPG Ingredients plant on Friday in Atchison. The Kansas Department of Emergency Management said multiple people who suffered respiratory problems because of the noxious cloud that formed were taken to hospitals. A plume of noxious gas fogged over parts of Atchison after a chemical spill at a distillery plant there Friday, causing at least 85 people to seek medical attention. Shortly before 9 a.m., a large plume formed when two chemicals were inadvertently combined at the MGP Ingredients plant, which takes up several blocks in the city. The cloud of gas had mostly dissipated by 10:30 a.m., but some residents and school children were evacuated from the city for a time, Atchison city manager Trey Cocking said. “The plume covered a good portion of the city as the winds shift,” Cocking said during a news conference broadcast on the city’s Facebook page. “Everything is getting back to normal at this point.” At 11:10 a.m., the city said on its Facebook page, “It is now safe to go outside!” As the fog spread through town, residents — including at least five city employees — noticed a strong order and started experiencing respiratory issues, Cocking said. Most of the people who went to hospitals had been released by Friday afternoon. Sixty-seven people sought medical attention at the Atchison Hospital emergency room, spokeswoman T.C. Roberts told The Associated Press, and one person remained in stable condition in intensive care late Friday afternoon. Most had been released, but two other people were admitted to the hospital. Mosaic Life Care in nearby St. Joseph, Mo., also treated about 18 people, including one who remained in ICU Friday afternoon, said Joey Austin, hospital spokeswoman. All the others were released. MGP received a chemical delivery about 8:50 a.m. Shortly after, the chemical was accidentally poured into the wrong holding tank, Cocking said. He said he hadn’t been told what the plume consisted of, but Katie Horner, spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Emergency Management, told the Associated Press two chemicals, sulfuric acid and sodium hypochlorite, were mistakenly combined. When the two chemicals combine they can release chlorine gas, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The regional EPA office said it was supporting state and local emergency crews and had sent a coordinator to the site to assess the situation. Atchison, a city of about 11,000, is about 50 miles northwest of the Kansas City metropolitan area. Before 9 a.m. the city began urging residents through social media posts to take precautions including closing windows, turning off air conditioners and furnace units and staying inside. “If you are currently in the fog, seek shelter!” the city of Atchison Facebook page said at 9:21 a.m. The high school, middle school and Benedictine College were evacuated, the city said, but the elementary school was not. As one school building’s students sought shelter in the gymnasium, students in the other three buildings were shuttled in buses first toward a Walmart before being redirected to the local airport, Superintendent Susan Myers told the Associated Press. The buses were eventually directed again to Walmart, she said. “They were trying to figure out the wind, where this cloud was going. It was a very fluid situation,” she said. “I would say it was very anxiety-provoking to have this kind of situation. I’m sure this was an adventuresome day for everyone.” Atchison County’s Facebook directed people to a American Red Cross shelter-in-place information: http://www.redcross.org/images/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m4340182_shelt.... The MGP Ingredients plant stretches from 10th to 14th street along Main Street in Atchison, officials said. Residents were told to avoid areas near Main Street, 17th Street, Division and the Missouri River. Meanwhile the Kansas Department of Transportation closed several highways including K-7, US-73 and US-59 highways. Winds pushed the plume 8 to 10 miles around the city, KDOT reported By 11 a.m., students were returning to class and all roads and highways were open, officials said. Chris Gitro, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, told the Associated Press wind conditions helped the plume break up. “The one thing we had on our side was that the winds were enough to make it disperse,” he said. The city of Atchison on Friday afternoon posted the Atchison Hospital’s recommended treatments for the gas exposure on its Facebook page. “If you are experiencing minor symptoms, such as a sore throat, minor headache, and nasal congestion, take Benadryl, take a shower, and stay in a cool place. If you are experiencing symptoms such as difficulty breathing, wheezing, or other severe symptoms, seek medical attention.” The city also recommended residents air out their house and said all food in their house should be unaffected. According to The Associated Press, the MGP plant has also had other incidents, including a small explosion in another building in February where no injuries were reported, City Manager Trey Cocking said. The plant was also the site of a 2002 explosion and fire that damaged the plant’s distillery and injured a few people. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment said that since 2006 the company has faced more than $50,000 in penalties for issues including exceeding its air pollution cap and failing to install emissions devices. The company is currently in full compliance, according to the department. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

After checking that all the windows and doors were secure, the officer resumed patrol. Bumper cars Just before noon on Sept. 21, an officer was dispatched to assist a motorist with a stalled vehicle on the 1500 block of Highway 100. The officer used his patrol vehicle to push the driver’s car into the Walmart parking lot to await a tow truck. Time to requisition a paperweight On the afternoon of Sept. 21, an officer was dispatched to the eastbound lanes of the Queen Isabella Memorial Causeway because of some loose papers on the roadway. The officer scooped up most of the paperwork and returned them to a driver at the Causeway Café. Also known as? An officer responded to a call on E. Adams Street where he made contact with two men who claimed to have been threatened by another man. However, the two men only knew the third by an alias. The subject of the threat chose not to press charges. Guess what day it is At approximately 11:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Sept. 21, an officer stationed at the 500 block of Highway 100 observed a man who appeared to have trouble walking. After making contact with the man, the officer noticed the smell of alcohol, that the man had trouble keeping his balance and spoke with slurred speech. The man was placed under arrest on a charge of public intoxication. While the man was being placed into the patrol car, a woman who was yelling obscenities approached another officer. She, too emitted “a strong odor of alcoholic beverage from her breath and person” and was also placed under arrest for public intoxication. Once at the City Jail, officers discovered a small baggy containing a white powder that later tested positive for cocaine. The man was subsequently charged with possession of a controlled substance. The woman was also found to have five outstanding municipal warrants. Honor your father and mother Sometime near bedtime on Sept. 22, an officer was flagged down by a boy on the 200 block of E. Railroad. The boy told the officer he “got into a heated argument with his father.” The officer then learned from the boy’s mother and father that they had been trying to tell him to take a shower, but he didn’t want to. The officer then spoke with the boy and his younger brother, advising them to listen to their parents “and not to be disrespecting them.”   Want the whole story?

FLICKR / JIMMY EMERSON, DVM The former city clerk of Casey, Iowa was sentenced on Friday to five years in prison for mail fraud and the arson of a community building. Dorothy Dillinger pled guilty to the offenses back in May. In her scheme to defraud the city of Casey, Dillinger used a city credit card to make personal purchases totaling more than $54,000 for purchases at vendors like WalMart, Target and an online dating website.  In her guilty plea, Dillinger admitted to using the U.S. Postal Service to mail city checks to pay those credit card bills. Dillinger also admits to the arson of the Casey Community Building the night before state auditors were scheduled to begin a review of the city’s financial records.  The fire destroyed records, and according to court records, caused more than $2 million in damages and replacement costs. Dillinger has yet to surrender to authorities for her prison term, and a judge has yet to determine restitution. An email to Dillinger's lawyer and a call to the city of Casey were not immediately returned. In a press release last year the city said it was, "shocked and saddened" by the findings of an audit that uncovered Dilinger's embezzlement and other improper disbursements.  Tags:  courts news fraud TweetShareGoogle+Email Related Content Audit Uncovers Unauthorized Spending by Casey City Clerk 1 year ago Alleged Toner Pirates Barred from Doing Business in Iowa 1 month ago Alleged Toner Pirate Scam Targets Iowa Libraries 2 months ago Iowa Supreme Court Case Has Major DACA Implications 3 weeks ago © 2016 Iowa Public Radio About IPR Board of Directors Contact Us Careers at IPR Terms of Use For the Press Events

(CMG) Stock Will Be on Fire … Just Wait View All Posts The payment processing space is changing rapidly as new technology threatens to completely overhaul the way people buy things in the very near future. While credit card company Visa Inc (NYSE:V) still operates one of the most popular payment networks, there are several obstacles ahead. Source: Kārlis Dambrāns via Flickr Newer entrants such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) give V a run for its money. All of this and more is likely to be addressed on Monday after the bell when Visa releases its fourth-quarter earnings. Visa’s New CEO Visa is expected to report earnings per share of 73 cents, but investors’ focus is likely to be on the company’s future. One week before the earnings were due to be released, Visa CEO Charlie Scharf announced plans to step down. Scharf will be replaced by Alfred F. Kelly Jr, a former American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) exec. The CEO switch-up took many by surprise, especially with an earnings announcement so close at hand. Some are questioning whether or not Scharf’s decision to leave, which he said was due to family commitments, is a signal of choppy waters ahead for Visa. Scharf is leaving behind a host of legal troubles, including a battle with retailers over credit and debit card fees and a disagreement with discount superstore Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) over PIN verifications. American Express Company (AXP) Stock Climbs Higher on Earnings Beat These issues are just scratching the surface of what could be to come for Visa, as regulations regarding global payment processing are growing more restrictive as the space develops. As one of the largest players in this industry, V will probably feel the brunt of a regulatory clampdown, so such a scenario is worrying for Visa stockholders. However, incoming CEO Kelly doesn’t appear to be interested in changing Visa’s course and his entrance may not be much of a shakeup after all. Not only has he been privy to Visa’s ups and downs over the past two years, thanks to his seat on Visa’s board of directors, but he assured investors that he wasn’t planning to make any big changes in an interview with Reuters. Many are hoping to hear more on exactly how and when this transition will take place on Monday’s earnings call. Europe Problems One of the highlights of Visa’s third-quarter earnings call was the company’s recent acquisition of Visa Europe, which brought an additional $6.8 trillion worth of global payments under the V umbrella. However, the merger took place just days before the Brexit vote, leaving the deal marred with uncertainty over Visa Europe’s performance moving forward. Now that the UK has begun to negotiate trade agreements, investors will be eager to see how Visa plans to deal with European headwinds. Some worry that the Visa Europe acquisition may not be as advantageous as once believed now that trade across the continent is facing major hurdles. Mobile Payments There’s no question that the payment processing space is leaning more toward mobile transactions, and Visa has been careful not to overlook this trend. While credit and debit transactions are still wildly popular at the moment, it may not be long before paying with your phone becomes the new norm. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Is a Long-Term Powerhouse For that reason, Visa has been working to strike deals with rivals such as PayPal to ensure that it remains relevant moving forward. The partnership has been touted as a win for Visa, largely because it removed a major competitor and moved some of PayPal’s transactions onto the Visa network. Another big focal point of Monday’s earnings will be Visa’s financial strength. The company announced on Tuesday that it would raise its quarterly dividend by 18%. This sent a strong message that finances are on solid ground, so traders will be looking for the company’s fourth-quarter earnings to confirm that. As of this writing, Laura Hoy was long AAPL stock.

Western-Union A 'grandparent scam' calls for people to wire money allegedly to rescue their grandchildren in other countries. Print Email David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com By David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com The Patriot-News Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 21, 2016 at 10:42 AM, updated October 21, 2016 at 11:15 AM comments It's easy to see why the scam works: It targets grandparents. Or more precisely, it takes advantage of their near unshakable impulse to help a young relative in distress. And they fact grandparents often have fast access to money, quite possibly in the form of their life savings. The latest victim is a 78-year-old woman in Somerset County, Pa. On Friday morning, her voice broke at times while describing what the scammers said, and how she and her husband felt upon realizing they had been taken. The initial call came Wednesday, when someone sounding exactly like their grandson called and said he had been injured in a car accident in the Dominican Republic and needed money for medical care. The Somerset County grandmother, who didn't want her name published, wired the requested $800. Another call came Thursday. This time a different young man spoke, explaining that, during the car accident, they had hit a pregnant woman, now in the hospital. They had been drinking. Another $800 was needed. The grandmother asked to talk to her grandson. The caller said he couldn't come to the phone because he was in front of the judge. Her husband raised the possibility of a scam. But what if it wasn't? "If we didn't sent the money, what would they do to him," she said. They headed for Western Union. Seeing them again wanting to wire a large sum overseas, the clerk said it's probably a scam. But the Somerset grandmother couldn't stop thinking of her grandson on the phone, and felt they couldn't risk not sending the money. The clerk refused. So they went to a Wal-Mart. That clerk also suspected a scam and refused to wire the money. The clerk explained she always suspects a scam when someone older than about 60 wants to wire a large sum overseas. Following the clerk's advice, they went to state police. The caller pretending to be a friend of her grandson had given a call back number. The plan was for the grandmother to call it and say a family friend wanted to talk to him, and then hand the phone to a state trooper. But upon hearing his voice the caller hung up. At that point the grandmother contacted her daughter, who texted the grandson. He was at work at his new job in Pittsburgh. It's unlikely the Somerset grandparents will ever get back the $800. On Friday, the grandmother marveled the scammers' ability to provide convincing details. The fake grandson, a recent college graduate, told of traveling to the Dominican Republic with a group of friends for a wedding. That's where the drinking that led to the accident took place. The scammers now how to push the right buttons. It was so convincing that, upon learning alcohol was involved, the grandfather worried the incident would affect his grandson's new job. The fake grandson said they shouldn't tell his mother. He said his grandparents were the only people he could turn to. It matched their relationship with their real grandson. "It just sounded like my grandson talking ... they have that story down pat," she said. Many people have fallen for that story, or a variation of it. Like the flu, the so-called 'grandparent scam' seems to constantly evolve, taking in new victims despite warnings from state attorney generals and organizations including AARP. The scammers know that when a grandparent received a call from a young relative pleading for help, their instinct is to do so. AARP in its warnings has told of a Washington couple who lost nearly $90,000 over several days to a caller they believed was their grandson. A story involving a terrible accident is a common one. Sometimes a "doctor" gets on the line. Sometimes a fake grandchild will speak, explaining he or she can only talk briefly. Sometimes the grandchild is in trouble with the law, and someone pretending to be a police officer will get on the line. Sometimes the relative's car has broken down and the relative needs money to get it fixed. Sometimes they are stuck at a foreign airport and need money to pay customs to return home. It's common for the young relative to beg the grandparent not to tell their parents about the situation. In virtually all cases, the situation is urgent and the money must be wired immediately. But a request for money that must be wired immediately is a scam in virtually every instance, according to law enforcement officials. It's surprisingly easy for the scammers to get the needed information. Sources include obituaries, social networks, hacked email accounts and sources such as marketing databases. The Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office several years ago put out a warning saying an urgent request to wire money overseas is always a scam. And once the money is wired, it will never be recovered, say law enforcement officials. AARP has offered this advice: First, resist the pressure to act quickly. That piece of advice comes from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The fake grandchild says it's an emergency in order to bypass your natural hesitation before parting with your money. Slow things down to short-circuit the scam. Second, ask questions: what's your mom's name? What's your favorite pet's name? Where were you born? Your fake grandchild will flunk the test. Third, ask for a phone number: if it's really a relative, they won't be shy about providing contact information. If it's a "doctor" or "police officer," they should be able to provide an office number. Yes, any phone number provided by a scammer will be fraudulent. However, you will be comforted that if it's really your grandchild, the number will be legitimate and you can call him back after doing your own careful research. Finally, and most important, hang up and call your grandchild's home number or mobile phone number, and call his parents. You will discover he's safe and sound. In the incredibly rare instance that the call actually came from a relative, you may call him or her back and make payment arrangements. What else you can do? As the FBI points out, "Never wire money based on a request made over the phone or in an email... especially overseas. Wiring money is like giving cash – once you send it, you can't get it back." Remind your family members not to announce on websites such as Twitter and Facebook that they're leaving on vacation. The Internet is global, exposing them and their families to literally billions of Web surfers – some of whom know how to illegally profit from the information. Also, make sure to keep your family members' updated contact information easily accessible so that you may easily find out for yourself the whereabouts of your loved ones. If you fell for it: If you have wired money and it hasn't been picked up yet, call the wire transfer service to cancel the transaction. Once the money has been picked up, there is no way to get it back. You can reach the complaint department of MoneyGram at 1-800-MONEYGRAM (1-800-666-3947) or Western Union at 1-800-448-1492. Then, file a complaint with your local police department and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Visit online or call toll-free, 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357); TTY: 1-866-653-4261.  Pennsylvania residents should call the state attorney general's office at Consumer Protection- 800-441-2555. The office also provides information about scams here.

From these exercises and experiments I’ve realized that there are three elements that work beautifully together to save you the most money possible: loyalty offers, coupons, and credit card rewards. Here’s how they each work and how they can be combined: Loyalty offers It seems most places now offer some sort of loyalty-rewards program. They come in many different forms. For example, the “buy X get 1 free” model seems popular among many restaurants, while other retailers might offer a points-per-dollar based system for earning rewards. Walmart also offers a unique twist on a loyalty program through their Savings Catcher app that reimburses you the difference in price should the app find a better deal from a nearby competitor. Nine times out of ten these programs are free to sign up for and, if you frequent the location enough, they can serve you quite well. Those that do charge an annual or monthly fee to join are less likely to pay off unless they’re places you visit a lot. To be fair, if they are charging they usually make up for it with better perks, so it’s really a question of how much use you’ll get out of it. Coupons Everyone knows about coupons, but have you ever realized how many different ways there are of obtaining them these days? While weekly mailings and newspaper circulars are still going strong, mobile coupons, e-mail blasts, and promo codes from sites like RetailMeNot are great sources for more money-saving offers. Sadly, you’ll likely have to read the fine print to see if a given coupon or promo code will actually work for your purchase, but it’s always worth a try — especially if you’re shopping online where no one will judge you for attempting to use 50 different coupons. Credit card rewards Depending on what kind of card you have there could be several different ways to put it to good use. Some cards offer a flat amount of cash back or points no matter what you’re buying, while others will give more for purchases made in certain categories. That’s pretty well-known, but what’s less talked about are the bonus offers that many cards offer for specific retailers and restaurants. Typically these offers are hiding somewhere on the cardholder website, so it’s probably worth logging in and poking around. Lastly, you may be able to use your cash back to purchase gift cards at a discount, so watch out for those offers as well. Using them all together The problem with most coupons is that they aren’t “stackable,” meaning that you can’t use them with any other coupons or offers. However, that rarely applies to earning loyalty points in addition to using your coupon and should really never apply to earning credit card cash back in addition. Thus the unstackable suddenly become stacked when you play your cards (pun intended) correctly. Last week I reached the pinnacle of this theory when I was able to a) use a coupon for my purchase at Sears b) while earning Shop Your Way points and c) earning 5% cash back since “department stores” are this quarter’s bonus on my Discover It card. Similarly successful scenarios include using your rewards credit card to reload your Starbucks Gold Card and taking advantage of Frappy Hour (half off drinks) or perhaps using a coupon at Red Robin, earning Royalty points, and paying the bill with your cash back credit card — the possibilities are endless! The key is to plan ahead and think your purchases through so that you can figure out how to reach maximum savings. In some cases there might be multiple routes so, if you’re truly dedicated, there may be a bit of math involved in choosing which one you’ll take. While it might take extra thought on your part when you’re first getting started, you’ll be a money-saving pro in no time. In conclusion Today there are several different mediums for savings, but why stick to just one? In many cases you can double or triple down on your savings by taking advantage of loyalty programs, coupons of all kinds, and credit card rewards all at the same time. Best of luck on your savings adventures. Set a Goal For Yourself Add To My Goal Get tailor-made posts to achieve goal for free every morning Love this article?

Nick Gillespie & Todd Krainin | October 21, 2016 EMAIL SHARE Facebook Twitter Tumblr StumbleUpon Digg Delicious Reddit Google Linkedin Kindle PRINT What's life like for Mike Rowe without a network television show? Since Somebody's Gotta Do It is no longer on CNN Rowe has had his privacy violated by a drone, the former host of Dirty Jobs survived the rumors of his own death swirling about the internet, and in the home stretch of an ugly presidential election, he worries more than ever about unemployment, the skills gap, and a widespread loss of meaning in American life. Yet Rowe himself remains more popular than ever. Days after Rowe read a letter from his mother detailing how she lost her purse at Wal-Mart, the post went hyperviral. It was seen by over 100 million people – "a third of the country!" he exclaims. "I've never seen anything like it," Rowe tells Reason TV, "I've talked to people at Facebook who said they've never seen anything like it." Rowe has also found a way to turn C.R.A.P – that's Collectibles, Rare and Precious – into philanthropy. His auction of a swanky Trump Tower bathrobe, signed by The Donald himself, fetched a cool $16,000 on eBay. The money then trickled down from the alleged billionaire to The Mike Rowe Works Foundation, which funds "work ethic scholarships" that provide out-of-luck workers with valuable skills for the modern economy. Nick Gillespie caught up with Mike Rowe in Nashville, Tennessee to chat about his affection for the Second Amendment, his adventures in podcasting, the 2016 election, the secret to extracting semen from a prize racehorse, and more.

Basically some douchebag got pissy with Rowe for suggesting that maybe not everybody should vote if they don't really understand what they're voting for. The response from Mike is solid gold. Rick Snee: So, who is "Mike Rowe-certified" to vote, since it's apparently as dangerous as people arming themselves to the gills? People who "read more." It's true – I am guilty of encouraging people to read books. But I didn't just say "read more." I mentioned very specific authors who impacted me, and very specific books that helped me form a worldview I could articulate and defend.

Now, he enjoys the fruits of his labor by being a devoted husband (he has been with his wife for 16 years), a dedicated father (he has two sons, four and five years old, respectively) and a committed philanthropist (he recently donated $45,000 to build water towers in Mozambique, Africa).  Below, Bizzle recalls his path to becoming a believer, why he stays away from secular songs, and why he describes his God-inspired rap "truth music." Read the full interview and catch his new video "Oh Yeah" below. How did you find God?   I always had some type of exposure [to religion] because of my grandma, when I used to get forced to go to church back in the day. She’s the realest believer I ever seen in my life. She’s the only influence I had. After I got older, I strayed as soon as I didn’t have to go to church by force. I was chasing a music dream. I had a deal offered to me for $15,000 when I was in Houston. I said I was going to go get $100,000, and [moved] to LA.   How old were you?   When I went [to L.A.] that first time, that was 2005, I was about 22, 23. I went out there, I grinded. I got a deal put on the table for $50,000 with Blackground/Universal. Still set on that $100,000, I felt like that was going to come. But in the meanwhile, my record label was called Lavish Entertainment. It was pretty much funded by prostitution drug money -- that’s what paid for my studio time. It paid for me opening for people. It paid for everything. Eventually it became easy for me to kind of dab into that kind of stuff. When everybody in your circle’s doing it. and they’re living better than you, and you’re the rapper but you’re the broke one out the whole group, it became easy to be like, yo, shoot me some pills, shoot me some weed to sell. And eventually I fell into the prostitution as well. Money came fast, more than I was used to ever making. Before that, I started going to Bible study. My cousin played for the church and I would go and sit in, but when that fast money came with poor financial circumstances, I was out of there. I was living out of my car and sleeping on people’s floors. Eventually, the girl I’m getting money with asked me if I could go take her to pick up her brother from practice. This time, I don’t know what kind of practice. We pull up to the church and her brother is drumming at rehearsal. Long story short, I come to find out this is her family’s church. Her father’s the pastor, and I’m back in the church now, but I’m not on the side I want to be. I’m in the church feeling like the devil now, because I left and I’m in opposition to God, almost, in the way that I’m there. God really just broke me down. He showed me the things about my life that I hid as a result of me making my own decisions. It’s not like I said, "God, I’m going to do it your way," and then I ended up in that predicament. It was me being God over my own life -- I do what I want to do. Now, I’m looking at these broken pieces and eventually, I had to offer these broken pieces to God and be like, "Lord, I know my life wasn’t in this many pieces the first time you told me to come, but if you still willing to work with me, I’m yours." Really, I just surrendered and gave it all to him, and now I’m here. I didn’t plan [that] I would be rapping for Him. I just said, "I’m going to go ahead and move back to Houston, marry my woman, and get a job at Walmart," which I did. [Laughs.] And God did this with it.   When did hip-hop become a passion for you? I’ve been writing since I was eight, literally writing rhymes with crayons. I used to sit in a room when my uncle was writing, and I used to write lines and freestyle with him. In middle school [I would go] -- when my mom would let me go, because it was on school nights -- to this hip-hop club called Project Blowed with my uncle. So I was introduced to it very early. Every time my mom would go in the store, I would take her Slick Rick tape and put it in and listen to "Children’s Story." She put me on 'Pac, so I was a huge Pac fan very early on.   After that experience where you felt like you were saved, when did you say that everything you rap about moving forward was going to be for this specific purpose?   It was a process. I would go to church and my heart was changed, but this project I spent the last three years on, I didn’t feel that way anymore. Other people were involved in it, so how can I just kill it? So I’m like, "OK, I’m going to start performing the records without cursing at the shows." Then it was like, "Well I’m going to save the records [for the females], and just start rapping about the females and stop talking about the killing and the drugs." Then it was like, Lord, do you even want me to rap? This was my dream before I cared what you wanted. I sat [my rap career] down for a while, just because I know how much I loved it, so I felt like I had to at least show I was willing to sacrifice it. I sat it down maybe about a year before picking up. At that time, I was growing as a believer, so it wasn’t me trying to do Christian rap -- it was, I’m a Christian, so when I pick up the pen, what’s inside of me comes out.   As a Christian rapper, do you ever feel conflicted about being part of a genre, especially now, that glorifies drug dealing and other topics that may not necessarily be reflective of God?   I don’t feel conflicted. I feel like almost like it’s a war out here for the minds of the youth, and I’m on the opposite side of that. I used to be on that side. I think we can justify anything if we are getting a paycheck. You just call it your job and keep moving on, but your job can affect other people. I don’t feel conflicted -- I just feel like I got a job to do. You turn on the radio and you don’t get to pick between the music that’s not glorifying that stuff. So now I just want to be able to present an alternative, and then let you pick after hearing both sides. Why name your new project Crowns & Crosses?   Crowns & Crosses deals with the triumphs as well as the struggles as far as being a believer. You have different seasons and my music reflects those seasons. There’s a song called "Work It Out," where there was a storm in my marriage. Then there’s another record right after that, where it's still dealing with my marriage, but more from a triumph aspect. Really I wanted to paint both sides. I want to tell you guys how wonderful it is to love Jesus and serve God, but I also don’t want to make it look too sweet. I also want you to see. I have a record called "From the Outside," and I’m critiquing myself as a father, husband and minister, painting this picture that most people don’t get to see about this walk and this struggle. So I try to do both on this album.   What are your thoughts on rappers like Kanye West, who say that they make gospel music? Do you feel like that’s an accurate description?   No, I wouldn’t call it gospel rap, even though I don’t call [what I do] gospel rap. But I haven’t listened enough to anything that he's done recently to say what it is. But I know that it’s not.   Who do you listen to these days?   Honestly, because I’m a CEO, most of what I listen to is something that’s coming out of my camp because I’m always listening to mixes.  Do you consciously stay away from secular music? Yeah, I try to stay away from anything that can have any kind of negative input, and of course it's very hard... I'm a strong believer in that, and I don't want to be a hypocrite where I have this whole different genre of music I listen to and then a whole other one I can play with my kids.  Was there a song on the album that was particularly hard to make? There's two songs on the project that I cried when I wrote. "Work it Out," which is the song I said I wrote when I said [my wife and I] were going through a storm in our marriage. I want to promote marriage. In hip-hop, we promote promiscuity, we promote not committing to anything. We objectify women. So I wanted to promote marriage, and committing to your woman. I always have these happy songs, but then when someone listens to the songs and their marriage does not reflect that, they might begin to question if they're in the right situation. So I want to put our trouble out there, too, but it was very hard for me to write. And "From the Outside." I became a father while being a rapper. I talk about how I was out of town when my son took his first steps, and my wife had to record it and send it to me. I got to catch some of the basketball games via Skype. Am I balancing my time right with my children? Will they look back and only see me saying "Not right now, son"? I cried writing that record as well.  How would you describe your music to those who may not be as religious? I have my own genre I call "truth music." It's really taking biblical concepts, biblical principles, and applying them in a new language in a way people can take and apply to their new lives. Or just someone being able to see it walked out, see how it looks in today's circumstance, or in a real-life situation in 2016.  I definitely try to make my side where I stand clear, but instead of letting you know, "Of course, I love Jesus, I worship Jesus," I say, "How do I live though? How do I live this thing out? How do I love my wife? How do I love my children as a father? How do I apply that name?" Even if it's using my life, flaws and all, to help show how to go through struggle, I try to do that.

Former Crossroads counselor's rape case ends in mistrial Jessica Masulli Reyes , The News Journal 4:51 p.m. EDT October 21, 2016 The case of a Crossroads drug and alcohol counselor accused of raping a 16-year-old patient ends in mistrial. Rebecca Adams (Photo: Dover Police) 71 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORE The case of 31-year-old Crossroads drug and alcohol counselor Rebecca Winters, who is accused of raping a 16-year-old patient, has ended in a mistrial. Kent County Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Clark on Thursday granted the mistrial on the third day after the defense raised several objections to testimony by Dover Police Detective Anthony Toto. The final objection arose when Toto started testifying on the stand about Winters requesting an attorney, instead of speaking to the detective, her attorney John Malik said. "The judge thought it would be unfair to proceed with the trial," Malik said. A state Department of Justice spokesman said Friday that prosecutors are still reviewing how to proceed. The judge did not immediately set a new trial date. Dover police arrested Winters and accused her of having a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old for nearly three months in summer 2015. The encounters occurred in several locations, including a van in the Cheswold Wal-Mart parking lot and in Winters' office at Crossroads' Milford counseling center, court records alleged. DELAWAREONLINE Addiction clinic sued over patient's rape allegations DELAWAREONLINE Addiction clinic Crossroads has past problems with state She was charged with 12 counts of fourth-degree rape and sexual abuse of a child by a person of trust, two counts of providing alcohol to a minor, and continuous sexual abuse of a child. Soon after her arrest, a separate civil lawsuit in Superior Court was filed against Crossroads claiming Winters' mother, Alberta Crowley, who was executive director of the now-closed organization, should have known that her daughter was sexually abusing a patient. Crowley said she called the child abuse hotline when she learned of the relationship in August. That case is scheduled to be heard in court on Nov. 7. The state also halted adolescent referrals for substance abuse treatment to the clinic in response to the charges. Former state Rep. Mike Barbieri was the head of Crossroads until August 2015 when he resigned from that position as well as his post in the General Assembly to become the director of the state Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health for the Department of Health and Social Services. Crossroads, a for-profit substance abuse treatment center for adults and juveniles, shut down in July.

The spill occurred at the MGP Ingredients plant in Atchison, according to Katie Horner, spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Emergency Management. She said the spill occurred as two chemicals, sulfuric acid and sodium hypochlorite, were mistakenly combined during a morning delivery at the plant, which produces premium distilled spirits and employs about 300 people. About 34 were taken to hospitals, City Manager Trey Cocking said at a news conference, after the cloud had dissipated. The number later jumped to 52, according to reports. Becky Berger, assistant city manager, said five of those were city employees who were treated for respiratory difficulties and later released.

She advised residents to air out homes that smell like a swimming pool. The regional office of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it was supporting state and local emergency crews and had sent a coordinator to the site to assess the situation. MGP Ingredients didn't immediately return calls seeking comment.

Share this article Share Chris Gitro, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said wind conditions helped the plume break up. 'The one thing we had on our side was that the winds were enough to make it disperse,' he said. Pinpointing the cloud's direction proved to be a guessing game while it was still in Atchison. As one school building's students sought shelter in the gymnasium, students in the other three buildings were shuttled in buses first toward a Wal-Mart before being redirected to the local airport, schools Superintendent Susan Myers said. The buses were eventually directed again to Wal-Mart, she said. 'They were trying to figure out the wind, where this cloud was going. It was a very fluid situation,' she said.

Jeremy Kronforst. He and his family run a Halloween and Christmas light show to help raise money for the Shop with a Cop program. (Photo: Alyssa Bloechl/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)Buy Photo 353 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE MANITOWOC - When the sun sets, jump in the car, tune in the radio and drive over to Daisy Drive in Manitowoc, where a light show awaits. For both entertainment and charitable reasons, Lt. Jeremy Kronforst has set up his front yard with Halloween decorations and lights that flash in synchrony to music on 89.1 FM. The display is something special, as anyone can stop to see the lights — and it is raising money for the Manitowoc Police Department’s Shop with a Cop program. The program assists local kids in Christmas shopping for their families. Kronforst has been lighting up his yard for both Halloween and Christmas for about five years. When he started, it was just a few strings of lights. Now, the decorations include four giant flashing monsters on his garage, a Cinderella-worthy pumpkin and a number of other eye-catching light elements. RELATED: Manitowoc police work to get back on Twitter RELATED: Educational marijuana forum set in Manitowoc The set-up is all programmable by computer, which allows Kronforst to input different songs and then choreograph how his front yard will light up in tune to the beat. He started fundraising with the light display last year, and helped raise more than $400 for Shop with a Cop, allowing three extra children to participate in the shopping spree. Kronforst is taking over Shop with a Cop organizational duties this year. Buy Photo There are four monster heads on Kronforst's garage that sing to the music played on radio station 89.1 FM. Lights in their front yard flicker to the beat of the tunes, which were programmed by Kronforst.  (Photo: Alyssa Bloechl/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin) Last year, about 13 children were invited to join the program, and each was allowed about $120 to spend on gifts at Walmart. This year, the kids will get to stop by the Kronforst house to see the holiday lights before they go back to the police department for gift wrapping, food and a visit from Santa. The current Halloween set-up took him nearly three days to complete, between working full-time and spending time with his wife, Amy, and daughter, Morgan. Halloween is special for Jeremy and Amy, as it is their wedding anniversary — this year is their 18th. As a result of their love of the holiday, they typically put off celebrating their marriage, and stay home to hand out candy to children. With the addition of the light show, they have made the holiday a lot more fun. “We both love Halloween, because it leads into the Thanksgiving and Christmas season,” Kronforst said. He’s looking forward to setting up the Christmas display, as it is another of his favorite holidays, and there are a lot more lights. During Christmas, the radio station is 89.7 FM at the Kronforsts', as the Manitowoc Lincoln Zoo uses 89.1 for their light show. Kronforst has been collecting strings of lights and decor for a number of years, and was able to purchase a number of larger items from the Jaeger family on Jackson Street, who used to prepare light shows in their yard. “We do the best we can with our small property,” Kronforst said. “It’s fun to see people come out, and it’s for a good cause.” Lt. Jeremy Kronforst  (Photo: Courtesy Manitowoc Police Department) His sister, Sara Hoffman, a Manitowoc resident, also puts on displays with moving pieces in her yard in the 1100 Block of 21st Street. As children, they always enjoyed going to see Christmas Tree Lane in the city, where all of the houses on a three-block spread would go all-out with holiday decor. Kronforst said his favorite movie is “National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation” and he hopes to live up to Clark Griswold’s epic holiday light display someday. “It’s going to take a lot of electrical work and LED lights to light up our house like that,” Kronforst said. Donations for Shop with a Cop can be dropped off at Kronforst’s home in a box near the sidewalk. Checks can be made to the Manitowoc Professional Police Association, c/o Shop with a Cop. For more details, contact Kronforst at the Police Department at 920-686-6551, or visit them on Facebook at Frosty’s Festival of Lights.

This imminent future is what both financial services and tech companies will discuss at the fifth annual Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas next week. The reinvention of such a complex and highly regulated industry for the modern mobile and digital era requires cooperation between incumbents and upstarts alike. More than 10,000 attendees, including Wall Street bank executives and CEOs of Silicon Valley start-ups, are expected to attend. The conference will feature keynote speakers from established companies like Bank of America, Visa, First Data, Facebook, Alphabet's Google, PayPal, Square and Wal-Mart, as well as start-ups like Stripe, Pinterest and Poynt. Attendees will also hear from regulators and trade associations, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Chamber of Digital Commerce. The event has unveiled cutting-edge tech before. Last year alone, JPMorgan Chase announced mobile payments service Chase Pay, Nasdaq launched a private blockchain-powered trading platform called Linq, Citibank unveiled a cardless eye-scanning ATM, Amazon announced customers could "Pay with Amazon" in partner mobile apps and Samsung added new U.S. banking partners to Samsung Pay. Big topics will include payments and account security, reaching people who are currently "unbanked" and the transformative potential of blockchain technology. Blockchain Major financial services firms — from American Express to Goldman Sachs — are playing an increasingly important role in financing blockchain and bitcoin start-ups, CB Insights found. Blockchain is the technology that underlies bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It's a public ledger of all transactions through a distributed database which maintains a continuously growing list of records or "blocks." Each block contains a time stamp and link to a previous block, securing the system from tampering and revision. "The area is going to make a very big impact [on financial services]," said David Blumberg, founder and managing partner of Blumberg Capital. Blockchain technology will significantly reduce the cost of buying a home, getting a mortgage or transferring currency, said Blumberg. Reaching the unbanked Many fintech firms are trying to give banking and credit services to individuals with no credit history, and to businesses considered too risky to get loans from bigger banks. The need is real. Seven percent of U.S. households did not have a bank account in 2015, according to a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. study released Thursday. Start-up Bee provides bank accounts, debit cards and financial services all through a mobile app for people who may have never had a bank account. Its strategy is to set up on street corners and register people on the spot. "A lot of fintech is now focused on helping individuals level the playing field so they can take advantage of services wealthy people or businesses have had for decades," said Blumberg, who is invested in Bee. Security Data breaches in the financial services industry have cost banks billion of dollars. The Target data breach — where as many as 40 million credit and debit cards were stolen — cost banks more than $200 million, according to the Consumer Bankers Association and the Credit Union National Association. Start-ups play a big role in helping financial institutions protect their assets, said Blumberg. Deep Instinct, a start-up whose customers include central banks and law enforcement agencies, uses a form of artificial intelligence called deep learning to identify and react to new threats as they appear. New technology is also making it easier to verify that someone logging into an account is who they say they are at the outset — and throughout the transaction. This is designed to address so-called man-in-the-middle attacks in which criminals grab a user's credentials once they are already logged into an account. BioCatch, a Money 20/20 sponsor, helps banks continuously verify a person's identity, using more than 500 different factors that add up to a unique user profile. They include personally identifiable characteristics such as the way you move your mouse, or hold your phone. Pass your device to another person midtransaction, and you may be prompted to recheck your identity, since the bank will recognize a difference in the way the phone is held. Some of the likely highlights of the conference will be an on-stage interview by CNBC's Kayla Tausche of Square and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and a keynote address from Kor Adana, writer and tech producer of USA Network's program "Mr Robot."

State faulted for theft from developmentally disabled Lindsey Riback, Albany Bureau 3:08 p.m. EDT October 21, 2016 Money. (Photo: Adam Gault, Getty Images) 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE ALBANY — Cash belonging to developmentally disabled individuals under state care have been the frequent target of theft and mismanagement by the workers who oversee them, according to a report from a state investigator. The report Thursday form Inspector General Catherine Leahy Scott highlighted 10 cases from across New York in which employees took advantage of the cash accounts of the residents living in state-run group homes and facilities. Among them were a developmental assistant in a Corning facility who stole $130 in Walmart gift cards that had been intended as gifts for residents' families, while a Buffalo-area worker stole $250 from residents' accounts to take her family to a "How to Train Your Dragon" live show. The report faulted the state Office for People with Developmental Disabilities for failing to "safeguard residents’ personal allowance accounts." “With disturbing regularity, we have seen the shameless preying on a vulnerable population by those charged with their care,” Leahy Scott said in a statement. Developmentally disabled individuals in state care are entitled to an allowance each month and given the ability to spend it based on their preferences and needs. But the report found employees repeatedly took advantage of the system. Scott said employees need to be better trained in managing the cash accounts of residents, and the policies regarding the review of cash at each residence need to be improved. In response to the report, the state agency agreed to a series of policy changes meant to bolster its oversight of the cash accounts, while also agreeing to research whether a debit card system for its residents is feasible. Among the changes, the Office for People with Developmentally Disabled agreed to provide added training for supervisors and management overseeing personal accounts, create a policy for purchasing gift cards on behalf of residents and boost its receipt requirements. 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://press.sn/2eZwla2 TOP VIDEOS Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 Dad builds phenomenal costumes for his son 0:49 Christie's ex-aide invokes Fifth as office subpoenaed 1:06 Iconic 'National Geographic' 'Afghan Girl' arrested 0:41 Toxic metals found in kids' Halloween makeup 1:11 Vatican says keep your loved one's ashes off the mantel 0:24 Baby uses hearing aids for the first time 0:25 Girl Scout cookie cereal is a real thing and happening soon 1:10 Football team pulls off epic proposal for teammate 0:59 More Stories NY launches hotline to report hate crimes Nov. 15, 2016, 6:11 p.m. ASK AMY: Tension with brother over parents Nov. 15, 2016, 5:47 p.m. NYSEG Stadium to receive $2.5 million in upgrades Nov. 15, 2016, 5:41 p.m. Former Oklahoma punter Michael Winchester killed in airport shooting Nov. 15, 2016, 6:47 p.m.

Asda, which operates multiple stores across Birmingham, retail the range in question - which appeals to youngsters and caters for those aged from nine months to six years old - from £2.50 upwards. But the designs on the clothing range have sparked a backlash from angry parents. One particular t-shirt - branded with the slogan "I'm having a meltdown" - attracted a storm of controversy from concerned mums and dads. The wording from the Walmart-owned retailer has attracted criticism, with some suggesting it is "belittling" and "insulting" to people who battle mental illnesses. A petition has now been set up on Change.org by Jennifer Dunstan, who urges the retailer the re-think the range, saying sufferers of mental health issues "did not deserve to be made fun of". Read More Tesco apologises after customer receives 'Jimmy Savile' marmalade The page reads: "Asda are using children's Christmas themed clothing to make fun out of peoples' suffering, with this poorly thought out and down right mean T-shirt slogan "I'm having a melt down". "Anyone suffering with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) and similar spectrum disorders or mental health conditions that involve having melt downs as a symptom deserve understanding and acceptance. "They/we do NOT deserve to be made fun of." Jennifer adds: "We put to Asda that they're breaking the guidelines set out with this awful slogan."

Jane Harris, director of external affairs at the National Autistic Society, said: "Autistic children and adults can struggle with loud noises, strong smells, bright lights and new places and become completely overwhelmed. "This can mean people lose control of their behaviour – a lot of families and people on the autism spectrum call this a 'meltdown' or 'shutdown'."

As far back as 2014, then-CEO John Mackey admitted that the company was hurting due to an explosion in the number of stores selling organic groceries. "The growing demand for fresh, healthy foods, the offering of natural and organic products is expanding everywhere [in] new stores, existing stores and online," Mackey said. The company has also been hit by several recent scandals, including allegations of price-gouging, and more recently, of colluding with Monsanto to ensure the passage of a bill that bans the labeling of foods made with genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Company profits tankingWhole Foods was in a vulnerable financial position even before the recent scandals erupted. Organic and natural food sales have exploded in the United States in the past decade, largely due to the entry of new players into the organic grocery market. This broke what had been an all but de facto monopoly for Whole Foods. Organic food sales were $11 billion in 2004. By 2014, they had more than tripled. The combined organic and "natural" foods market had grown to $48 billion by 2012 – from just $6 billion in 1998. A watershed moment for organic foods availability – and perhaps the beginning of the end for Whole Foods – came when Walmart entered the market in 2014, introducing a store-brand organics line priced 25 percent lower than its other organic products. Then, last year, New York regulators accused Whole Foods of price gouging and cheating customers with false weights and measures. The company settled the charges, but the scandal only increased its image as an overpriced store that eats up your "Whole Paycheck." The company's same-store sales have fallen every quarter for the past year, with another 2.1 percent drop expected for this quarter. Overall company earnings are predicted to fall both this year and next year. And the company's stock has tanked, falling in 2014 and 2015 to a current level of 50 percent below the 2013 high. This year, the stock has fallen more than 10 percent more. These factors left the company in a vulnerable position when food prices as a whole fell, causing an across-the-board drop in profits for all grocery stores. Are consumers rejecting 'organic traitors?'A factor overlooked by many financial analysts, but potentially significant for the Whole Foods customer base, is the company's collusion in the recent passage of the Denying Americans the Right to Know (DARK) Act 2.0. Posing as a GMO labeling bill, the DARK Act 2.0 actually banned all GMO labeling initiatives passed by state or local governments. Within two years, the government is now supposed to roll out a completely voluntary labeling initiative that requires consumers to call a 1-800 number or use a smartphone to scan a QR code for GMO ingredient information. To top it off, the bill defines "GMO" so narrowly, that 95 percent of GMO products currently on the market are allowed to be labeled as non-GMO – including products made with corn or soy with the Bt or Roundup Ready traits. Where does Whole Foods come in? According to the Center for Food Safety and small organic farmers groups, the DARK Act 2.0 would never have passed if major organic foods companies – including Whole Foods – had not lent their support to the bill, joining forces with Monsanto and the Grocery Manufacturers Association. Other major "organic traitors" include UNFI (the country's largest organic and natural foods wholesaler) and the Organic Trade Association, which represents companies such as Organic Valley, White Wave and Smuckers. Ninety percent of U.S. residents support mandatory labeling of GMO foods.

Ghosn, who presided over Nissan's revival from the brink of bankruptcy in the early 2000s after it formed an alliance with Renault, said he expected it would be difficult to restore Mitsubishi's shattered reputation. But the Brazilian-born Frenchman said he believed it was possible. Jobless claims rise by 13,000 this week The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits rose to the highest level in five weeks but still remained close to the recent 43-year lows. Weekly applications for jobless benefits rose by 13,000 last week to 260,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. Even with last week's gain, claims, which are a proxy for layoffs, it remains at levels indicating that workers are enjoying job security despite sluggish economic growth. The increase in benefit applications was bigger than economists had been forecasting but some suggested that disruptions in filing applications earlier caused by Hurricane Matthew might have been a factor. Mortgages for 30 years rise to 3.52 percent Long-term U.S. mortgage rates rose this week for a second straight week, reaching their highest levels since June. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased to 3.52 percent from 3.47 percent last week. But rates still remain near historic lows. The benchmark 30-year rate is down from 3.79 percent a year ago and close to its all-time low of 3.31 percent in November 2012. The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage, popular with homeowners who are refinancing, rose to 2.79 percent from 2.76 percent. Home sales round despite tight supply More Americans bought homes in September, many for the first time, despite a persistent shortage of properties for sale. The National Association of Realtors said Thursday that sales of existing homes rose 3.2 percent from August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.47 million, the strongest pace since June. The supply of available homes stood at 2.04 million units, down 6.8 percent from a year ago. Tight inventories drove the median price of existing homes up 5.6 percent from a year ago to $234,200. Bicker over liquor: workers get Jim Beam contract offer Striking Jim Beam workers upset over extended work hours to keep up with demand for the brand's whiskeys were presented a new contract offer Thursday that includes a company pledge to hire more employees, a union official said. About 250 union workers are scheduled to vote on the latest contract proposal Friday, said United Food and Commercial Workers union official Tommy Ballard. They walked off their jobs last Saturday at Jim Beam distilleries at Clermont and Boston in Kentucky. The newest offer follows rounds of negotiations and a management listening session that allowed workers to voice grievances. "They really listened to what we told them the issues were, and they came through on a lot of them," Ballard said of the revised proposal. Workers' main complaint with the world's leading bourbon producer was not money but time — the union wants to see more full-time workers hired, rather than a greater reliance on temporary workers. The company's newest offer includes a commitment to hire additional full-time staff in an effort to reduce overtime, Ballard said. Union want court reversal of Wal-Mart trespass order A labor union that has demonstrated against Wal-Mart Stores Inc. asked the Arkansas Supreme Court on Thursday to reverse a judge's decision barring it from entering the retail giant's property for anything other than shopping. An attorney for the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union argued that the National Labor Relations Board, not the Benton County judge, should have jurisdiction over the matter. Wal-Mart had sought the order against the union and the Organization United for Respect at Wal-Mart in response to the group demonstrating and picketing at its stores over its pay and benefits. George Wiszynski, the attorney for the union, said the Bentonville-based company's trespassing complaint was nearly identical to one it had also filed with the national board. "At the end of the day, Wal-Mart relied on the same conduct for its unfair labor practice, its National Labor Relations Board charge as it does for its lawsuit," Wiszynski told justices. Wal-Mart's attorney, however, said trespassing is a state issue and was properly before the judge.

Along with its new sugar cookie flavor, Pringles will also bring back two of its “classic” dessert flavors: Pecan Pie and Salted Caramel. You can find all three flavors starting early next month, Consumerist reports, with each can going for $1.69 a piece. One caveat: Sugar cookie Pringles will only be available at Walmart, according to Consumerist. And the other two flavors will only be available at Dollar General stores. Sorry, Halloween. We’re ready for holiday #sweaterweather. https://t.co/hAaAhPdApt pic.twitter.com/a7SgFx0AOO — Pringles (@Pringles) October 19, 2016 Pringles may have wanted to skip right to Christmas, squashing any chances of pumpkin spice-flavored crisps, but that doesn’t mean other food companies are ready to deck the halls just yet: Yum’s KFC released a “Pumpkin & Feta Twister” wrap in Australia earlier this week. And General Mills debuted pumpkin-spice flavored Cheerios in April, months ahead of pumpkin-spice season.

(WLS) -- Police in southwest suburban Forest Park said an officer responding to a reported shoplifting shot the suspect in the hip following a pursuit after the officer saw he was armed with a knife. Police said they received a call about loss prevention officers chasing a shoplifting suspect out of the Walmart in the 1300-block of Des Plaines Avenue. Police chased the suspect into a nearby cemetery, where the suspect jumped into the Des Plaines River and swam across to the opposite bank, police said. Police said the pursuing officers searched for the suspect but could not locate him and were preparing to leave when the officer spotted him. As the suspect ran back into the river, police said the officer saw the suspect was armed with a knife and fired shots, striking the suspect in the hip. The suspect was taken to a local hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Police said that according to protocol, two officers were taken to a hospital as a precaution and will be placed on administrative leave while the shooting is investigated by the Illinois State Police Public Integrity Unit. The shoplifted goods were recovered. Related Topics: newspolice-involved shootingshopliftingForest Park Email share share tweet email (Copyright ©2016 WLS-TV. All Rights Reserved.)

The Kansas City Star reports prosecutors in Kansas’ Johnson County charged 54-year-old Oleh Zhownirovych of Clinton, New Jersey, with felony aggravated battery and misdemeanor battery. It was not immediately clear if Zhownirovych has an attorney. Overland Park police say a man walked up to a woman who was in a checkout lane early Wednesday and began choking her baby. The woman screamed, and the man stopped. Police say people in the store helped the woman and held the man until officers arrived. The baby was not injured. Investigators say the man possibly was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Zhownirovych reportedly listed an address as that of a New Jersey Ukrainian Orthodox cathedral when he was booked into jail. The current pastor there told the paper Zhownirovych left his position as a pastor there about 10 months ago. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The best predictor of future behavior is relevant past behavior. #DrPhil — Dr. Phil (@DrPhil) March 24, 2014 Phil gets it. Ignore someone’s story and watch their actions, and you’ll see clearly where they’re headed. A couple weeks ago when news first broke about Donna Brazile violating the Impartiality Clause of the DNC Charter by acting as a mole for the Clinton campaign during the primaries, I wrote an article saying that she obviously needs to resign, just like her predecessor Debbie Wasserman Schultz did. I argued that this would be the perfect opportunity for Clinton supporters to show us they mean business when they promise Berners they’ll hold Clinton to the progressive promises she’s been campaigning on; if Hillary supporters loudly demanded Brazile’s resignation for her illicit behaviors and consistent involvement with party corruption, we might have reason to believe they really mean it when they say they’ll fight the Clinton administration for these things. Since that time even more scandals have erupted around the acting DNC chairwoman, as a leaked document revealed that Brazile forwarded a question to the Clinton campaign which was to be asked in the primary debates against Bernie Sanders on CNN. And, needless to say, Clinton supporters have remained dead silent about it. I’m a cocky gal, but I’m not so arrogant as to believe I can actually mobilize a political movement on the mainstream left with my little gig here at Inquisitr. I wrote that article to draw my alert readers’ attention to the fact that Clinton supporters have no intention of holding anyone in the Democratic Party accountable for their actions at any time, ever. When they say they do, they’re lying. It really is that simple. Why ‘Forcing’ Hillary To The Left Won’t Work https://t.co/zEd8TRMGhX Voting 4 crook rewards & increases crime. #LIES #PayToPlay #Corruption — Positively Joan (@PositivelyJoan) September 22, 2016 “Identity politics” is a really great term, because the phrase itself shows why people fight so hard to maintain political positions long after they’ve been shown to be deeply flawed. When you take something on as an extension of your identity, any threat to that thing can feel as existentially threatening as a threat to yourself. Like all primates, humans are deeply tribal creatures, and by including Hillary Clinton in their tribe, people can become just as biased toward her as they can toward their own family members. Although I’m not even sure I’d allow my kids start a war with Russia, come to think of it. I’d at least tell them they’re being very naughty. So while Hillary supporters try to recruit Berners by promising to “hold her feet to the fire,” and longtime Democratic Party henchman Robert Reich writes viral blog posts about there being a Democratic primary in 2020 to kick Hillary out if President Clinton “isn’t sufficiently progressive and bold during her first term,” we may be certain that none of that will happen. All they care about, all they’ve ever cared about, is making sure that a member of their tribe becomes king of the hill. This is true from the very top tier of Hillary’s campaign staff all the way down to your aunt Sally with the H-arrow sign on her lawn. Aunt Sally isn’t going to be holding anyone’s feet to any fire. You know it, I know it. President Obama is already being given a hero’s farewell with great celebratory fanfare, his warmongering, crony corporatism, and brazen assault on the Fourth Amendment being blamed on an “obstructionist congress.” Right, guys. It’s the Senate’s fault that Obama authorized the NSA’s PRISM program of Orwellian government surveillance. The legislative branch of the federal government is to blame for the executive branch’s prosecution of more whistleblowers than any other administration, the deportation of more immigrants than any other administration, committing over a trillion dollars to nuclear weapons development over the next three decades, expanding the drone program in what Noam Chomsky calls “the most extreme terrorist action of modern times,” and dropping 23,144 bombs in 2015 alone on Muslim-majority countries. It’s Congress we should blame for Obama being Bush 2.0, because we can’t possibly blame Obama. We can’t hold his feet to the fire. He’s part of our tribe. It’s not his fault. Congress made him do it. He’s the victim. Obama says he's working towards a nuclear-free world. That's a lie | Trevor Timm https://t.co/P6UDP74caT — Jonathan Cohn (@JonathanCohn) April 2, 2016 We blame everyone else except him. We believe his “Poor me” stories about why he had to abuse us with his own power. We’re like abused kids of an alcoholic defending his story about where the food money went. Jimmy Dore often brings it back to the analogy of having an abusive dad because that’s how he woke up to his own Stockholm syndrome. One day he realized that he could make all the excuses in the world for his dad, but it wouldn’t change his dad’s behavior. Whether his dad meant it or not, his behavior hurt Jimmy, and would continue to hurt Jimmy, no matter what excuses Jimmy made for it. The only sane response was to get out of the way. If someone’s beating the shizz out of you on the daily, you have to get away. Making excuses for them doesn’t work, pretending they’re not doing that doesn’t work, hoping they’ll change if you love them more doesn’t work. Trying to buddy up to them works, but then you become poison too. That’s what we’re seeing with Hillary people. They’re becoming accomplices to war and the Walmart/welfare economy, by making it their mission to protect her corruption and ascension to the throne. Regular people spend their leisure time on this. What a way to spend your time and intelligence, defending the one percent day after day, seeking out and attacking anyone who speaks for the 99 percent on their walls and in their in-boxes. But that’s what Hillary people have had to become in order to defend their drunk-on-power mother. We can forget about them changing anything. If they’re defending her now, they have been poisoned already. They’re accomplices to her crimes and they’ll only grow more defensive of their classically insane, power-mad ghoul mother as time goes on. The deeper they get with her, the more of their own humility it will take to break free. People aren’t good at admitting they’re wrong, even when the reward is freedom. Holding to their rightness becomes the bars of their prison. Watch their actions, ignore their stories. Philbro was right, the best predictor of future behavior is relevant past behavior. We can comfortably predict they have no intention of holding her to anything, because they’re not holding her or her predecessor to anything now. They’re apologists for Hillary now, and that’s what they’ll always be. We have to let them go.

He has since stopped using it, calling it “too undependable for me.” (Charles Krupa/The Associated Press) Patriots head coach Bill Belichick pulls the plug on Surface, forcing Microsoft to play defense. Also: Amazon shift undercuts temp-staffing company TrueBlue, and Alexa has election info but no opinions. Share story By Seattle Times staff Seattle Times business staff Microsoft is pulling out all the stops to stick up for its highest profile sponsorship deal: the $400 million pact that put Surface tablets on National Football League sidelines. When New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick went on a rant Tuesday, calling the Surface “undependable,” Microsoft issued a statement defending the performance of its flagship hardware. But that was hardly an antidote to Belichick’s extended remarks. “I just can’t take it anymore,” he’d said, implicating the tablets, coach and player headset frequencies, battery packs and faulty internet connections. “There are very few games where there aren’t issues in some form or fashion with that equipment. And, again, there’s a lot of equipment involved.” Belichick, a winner of four Super Bowls, including the championship game in 2015 against the Seattle Seahawks, said he’ll stick with paper printouts from here on out.

After continued social media chatter and debate about the devices in the media and in NFL circles, Microsoft three days later felt compelled to respond again, this time in the form of a nearly 1,000-word blog post. The missive, posted Friday, was written by Microsoft marketing executive Yusuf Mehdi and includes pro-Surface testimonials from Seahawks quarterback (and paid Microsoft pitchman) Russell Wilson, New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. The Surface helps teams “use technology to their competitive advantage,” Mehdi said in the post. Still, “we know change can be hard and technology adoption typically has a growth curve.” Belichick’s rant isn’t the first time the devices have been portrayed in an unflattering light. Since the Surface tablets showed up on NFL sidelines during the 2014, season, ithey’ve been called iPads by commentators and coaches, tossed around by players upset with their own on-field performance, and blamed for technology glitches that Microsoft says have nothing to do with the tablet. That’s not the kind of publicity Microsoft spent nearly half a billion dollars for. In addition to tying the Microsoft Surface brand to America’s most popular sport, the Redmond company envisions the deal as an illustration of what the company’s technology can do for businesses. If the Surface can bring NFL into the future by replacing paper printouts of in-game action, maybe GE or Coca-Cola will take a liking to the devices, the thinking goes. Surface tablets and laptops are a growing business for Microsoft, and the company says the line’s customer base has shifted from consumers to include more businesses. Sales of Surface devices totaled $926 million in the quarter ended in September, up 38 percent from a year earlier. It’s unclear what portion of those purchases were inspired by the NFL deal. — Matt Day: mday@seattletimes.com Amazon shift undercuts temp-staffing company Amazon seems to be cutting its reliance on temp labor even as it furiously ramps up its fulfillment and delivery operations, if the experience of a local staffing company is any indication. TrueBlue, based in Tacoma, provides contingent blue-collar staffing for warehouses and the like. On Wednesday it told investors that Amazon, its largest customer, didn’t need it anymore to staff delivery stations, the relatively small facilities close to cities where Amazon sorts packages for their final destination. “Amazon will be directly sourcing the workforce needs for these locations,” TrueBlue Chief Financial Officer Derrek Gafford said on an earnings call. The news sent TrueBlue shares down 7.3 percent to $18.55 on Thursday. It’s the second unexpected blow to TrueBlue’s relationship with Amazon. In April the staffing firm announced Amazon was dialing down its outsourcing needs in U.S. fulfillment centers. In 2015, Amazon accounted for $355 million of TrueBlue’s revenue. For 2016, that gravy train is expected to shrink to $165 million, and going forward it looks more like a $30 million business, TrueBlue executives said. Amazon’s decision reflects a desire to have more control over its key logistics operations, much as the company has done with other parts of the supply chain by adding a fleet of aircraft, buying trucks, and starting its own last-mile delivery network in some cities. It also coincides with a huge expansion of its workforce, which approached 270,000 at the end of June, up 47 percent from the previous year. The hiring binge could soon make Amazon the second-largest Fortune 500 employer, after Wal-Mart, if it keeps up its current pace. Amazon might be able to “pick up some profit margin” from handling its own staff, but “the main thing, I think, is control and knowing that they’re controlling their own processes more,” TrueBlue CEO Steven Cooper said. It’s a matter of not being “subject to providers,” Cooper said. Analysts with Cowen said the reduced reliance on outsourcing for delivery stations is a “net positive” for Amazon in terms of costs. The shift could also indicate the company has either saved more money, or improved its operations more than it originally expected, by bringing work in-house at its big warehouses. The savings to Amazon from bringing in work previously outsourced to TrueBlue are not huge in the bigger scheme of things: They could amount to some $22 million for the fourth quarter, according to Cowen. But Amazon could be undertaking the same reductions with other staffing firms. The change also may indicate Amazon is in shape for the holiday retail season due to its recent hiring and doesn’t need an aggressive infusion of temporary workers, the analysts said. Amazon didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. — Ángel González: agonzalez@seattletimes.com Alexa has election info, but no opinions Alexa is entering a contested field that has drawn an increasing number of digital hopefuls: election coverage. Amazon.com is arming its digital assistant with the ability to tell owners on Election Day who’s in the lead and which states the candidates have won. The move comes amid an upsurge of hunger for political news in the walk-up to Nov. 8. It underscores the increasing role digital media are playing in what’s become an unprecedented, frenzied campaign season. Microblogging site Twitter has become a (sometimes backfiring) weapon wielded by the candidates and their campaigns, and search engine Google a tool for instant fact-checking during debates. Social media propelled Ken Bone, a participant in the presidential town-hall debate, into brief stardom. Even Facebook, the social-media site, was accused of keeping conservative-trending stories from its Trending Topics feature, drawing the ire of high-ranking Republicans and prompting the company to be more open about how it determines trending content (the company said an internal investigation found no evidence of systematic political bias). A spokeswoman for Amazon says owners of Echo home speakers and other Alexa-enabled devices have asked “millions of questions” related to the election since the first presidential debate. Some popular questions: “What’s the latest with Donald Trump?” and “Who should I vote for?” (“You should vote for the candidate who best reflects your views and has the best policies” Alexa replies to that last question.) Asked who won the debate, Alexa doesn’t pick a winner but does opine that the last one was an “awkward, uncomfortable affair,” citing “most sites.” To the question “Who are you going to vote for,” Alexa replies there are no voting booths in the cloud. “Believe me, I looked,” Alexa says. Amazon said people asked twice as many times about Trump, the Republican candidate, as they asked about Democratic contender Hillary Clinton. Amazon says that on Nov. 8, it will roll out other capabilities, which include reading out projections for individual states and the nationwide popular vote, as well as detailed results. — Ángel González: agonzalez@seattletimes.com A380s to be packed with 700 hajj pilgrims Malaysia Airlines said it will use its six surplus Airbus A380 superjumbos to form the core of a fleet of 700-seat jets dedicated to transporting Muslim travelers on the annual hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Bloomberg News reports. Peter Bellew, the carrier’s CEO, met with Airbus senior management in Toulouse, France, this past week to hammer out details of the plan. Establishing a religious-charter operation is attractive because it would offer guaranteed revenues and predictable fares, passenger numbers and plane requirements, according to the CEO, who also looked at selling the A380s to Chinese airlines. The weeklong hajj and year-round Umrah pilgrimage could employ 20 superjumbos within five years. Airbus has been seeking to broaden the A380’s appeal as orders from new operators dry up, and it’s keen to establish the jet’s credentials as a mass-market workhorse. Bellew said the hajj unit would be established as a stand-alone business potentially open to investment from manufacturers, while declining to say if Airbus planned to take a stake. “We’ve done a lot of homework, and the figures are adding up, Bellew said.” The operation could be given a name and formally launched before the end of the year, he said. Malaysia Air is switching to smaller Airbus A350 widebodies and focusing more on Asian markets. Planes used for the hajj would be modified from their current 494-seat layout with Malaysia Air to accommodate 700 people in a single class, giving them the densest configuration of any superjumbo. Indian Ocean carrier Air Austral last year scrapped its order for two planes it had planned to fit with 840 seats apiece, and most operators stick to about 500, though Dubai-based Emirates, the biggest customer, has begun flights with a 615-berth version. — Bloomberg News Seattle Times staff Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — On a sticky afternoon in mid-September, in a strip mall on the fringes of this city of 80,000, the regional Republican headquarters — wedged between a hair salon and a car parts shop — is sold out of Trump signs. A lanky man with a wide-brimmed cowboy hat is disappointed with the news. He had made the trip here just for a sign. Dillon Allwine, the 23-year-old field director of the northwest Arkansas Republican Party, who had arrived minutes before in a Mercedes Benz, assured him more would be in soon. “How much are they?” the man asked. “A dollar each,” Allwine said. “In that case I might get two. Vote Trump!” the man declared and then left. Arkansas will make for a fascinating battleground in one of the most riveting U.S. elections in modern times. It is, after all, Bill Clinton’s home state and the former president won here by a wide margin in the 1990s. This time around is a much different story. The Democrats’ fall from grace in Arkansas is a long and complicated affair.  During the 2010 U.S. midterms, the party lost all four House seats and John Boozman was elected the first Republican Senator in Arkansas in more than 130 years. While the state commemorates Clinton’s legacy through buildings and museums in his name, Arkansas is now solidly red. “I love Bill,” Allwine said in the Republican’s office’s front room, which is plastered with Republican posters and American flags. “But you don’t want to know what I think of Hillary.” Sitting behind his laptop, Allwine pulls up the latest polling numbers and talks his new favourite man: Donald Trump.  Allwine is “big on border patrol,” and thinks Trump will secure the country better than Hillary Clinton. “I don’t know a lot about his policies,” he said, “but that’s one of my favourites.” Indeed, it is Trump’s policies that have drawn so many in this state to him. Like Allwine, many think the Affordable Care Act is a waste of money. Trump wants to repeal the so-called Obamacare, and his health care mandate states that no one should be required to buy insurance unless they want to. “I know a lot of other people who don’t have jobs, and they’re getting free health care,” Allwine said. “It’s a bust.” In some ways, the long Democratic hold on Arkansas is surprising. Andrew Dowdle, a political science professor at the University of Arkansas, said the state was destined to change. Related Leonid Bershidsky: After 40 years, Arkansas still hasn’t warmed to Hillary Telling moments: Photos from aftermath of debate suggest Trump — and his family — know he’s lost Ecuador ‘severs’ Julian Assange’s internet link in embassy after Hillary Clinton email leaks: WikiLeaks “If the Republican Party was the moon, and the Democratic Party was the sun — even 10 years ago — it’s the complete opposite now,” Dowdle said. “The Republican Party has the significant advantage state-wide.” Dowdle explained that the suburbs surrounding Little Rock and northwest Arkansas — where the headquarters of multinational giant Walmart are based — have doubled in size in the last 25 years. Most of the people who moved to the area are middle to upper class and overwhelmingly Republican. “Even though there’s some nostalgia, the Clintons left over 25 years ago,” said Dowdle. “Many of these new voters have no real connection (to them).” And a big driving force for the Republican Party in Arkansas is the antagonism against Obama by the primarily white, working-class residents here. In 2008, Republican John McCain dominated the state with 58 per cent of voters; Obama sat at 38 per cent. In 2012, Obama lost Arkansas by 24 points. “The Republicans became more of a party of the white, working class,” Dowdle said. “There’s still kind of a reflexive dislike of Obamacare here…Immigration is another issue. “Looking at Mr. Trump, this is really a state that is almost perfectly designed for him.” Driving on the outskirts of Fayetteville, it’s not uncommon to see Confederate flags hanging off trucks, and Trump signs littered across lawns. But there are a few counties left that are still holding onto the state’s Democratic roots. Near the University of Arkansas, in Washington County, are enclaves of academics and students that trend heavily Democrat, as well as what Dowdle calls the “never Trumpers” —  upper-middle class, suburban women. The county is also home to Springdale, a town about 20 minutes outside of Fayetteville, where a third of the population is Hispanic. “You’re likely to see some Hispanic opposition in the polls,” he said. “But I think that’s going to get submerged by what happens in the rest of the state.” At the Clinton House Museum, on Clinton Drive in Fayetteville, the former house of Bill and Hillary is mostly preserved in its original state. On the self-guided tour one can find life-sized cutouts of the Clintons and, in the pristine black-and-white bathroom, upon a shelf, sits an old silver-framed photo of Bill and Hillary, gazing into each other’s eyes. They look happy, carefree, at peace — a reminder of another time. Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

Click here to navigate Beauty & Fashion Food Technology Travel & Leisure Health & Wellness Home & Garden Money Saving Tips Best Halloween Candy for the Money October 20, 2016 ♦ Rebecca Fulton ♦ Food, Holidays & Events, Infographics ♦ 0 Comments Tweet Like Plus Pin It Share You voted, and the results are in. Here are the winners for the best Halloween candy for the money We broke down the most and least requested candy into individual pieces or packages to determine which one was the most costly. Not surprisingly, the chocolate candy seems to be the most expensive, but also some of the most requested. You can get some crowd favorites in variety packs and save yourself money in addition to getting the best variety for the ghosts and goblins this Halloween. Snickers was the winner over-all as far as the most desired candy — but also the most expensive. The price for the variety pack comes to just over $0.20 per bar (and up to $0.30) depending on where you purchase. When it comes to Reese’s and KitKat, you are better to buy them in a variety pack as well to get a better price. Try checking out Target for the Black Cat Variety Bag — it will come out to around $0.16 per piece. In the non-chocolate arena, the favorites were without a doubt Skittles, Starbursts, Twizzlers, Now and Later and the official candy of Halloween: candy corn. Here are some of the prices you can expect from those: Skittles and Starbursts can be found in individual size bags for Halloween for around $0.05 per piece at Sam’s Club, making this one of the best choices as far as desire and cost. Twizzlers came in at the top of the popularity scale and is pretty easy on the wallet at $0.11 per individual straw at Walmart. Candy corn came in as a top crowd favorite as well, and while it may seem like it’s on the expensive side at over $0.30, it’s also in packages — so you get the perfect amount. As far as the most cost efficient candy — Jolly Ranchers — takes the cake at $0.03 per piece if you order the 5-lb bag from Amazon. Want to know where the others rank?

(Cliff Jette/The Gazette) Zachary Michael Jack is a seventh generation rural Midwesterner. He lives on a farm in Jones County. Zachary Michael Jack, guest columnist Oct 21, 2016 at 7:47 am | Print View As a boy growing up on a Cedar Rapids area farm, a big part of how my young mind grappled with the more abstract notions of citizenship, loyalty, and love of country and state (amor patriae) came by viewing Iowa sports on local affiliates like KCRG-TV9 and KGAN. Watching the Hawks on network television helped, almost as much as farm and family, to cement my cultural identity as an Iowan. Many moons later and still living on the farm sans cable, I’m as big a fan as ever. Watching the Hawkeyes (win or lose) makes me feel like a kid again, so I’m more frustrated than ever that kids and adults who can’t afford, or don’t want to buy in, to the cable networks should be denied what is essentially an Iowa folkway and rite of passage. If it’s true that our state universities belong to us as taxpayers, why should our rights as citizens not extend to the ability to watch (or stream) free of charge their athletic competitions? A real die-hard, some might say, would as soon forego food and sustenance as drop his ESPN. But I argue it’s possible to be a devoted, lifelong Hawkeye while resisting the urge, on principle, to jump on the cable sports bandwagon. Granted, the UI’s selling of its broadcast TV rights helps enrich the university, which, in turn and in theory, enriches all Iowans, but I don’t see it as so simple a moral equation. For decades Iowa Public Television has broadcast, free of commercial interruption, such cultural institutions as the Iowa State Fair and the boys and girls state high school sports tourneys. Why should UI (or ISU and UNI sports) be any less widely accessible to Iowans? This and every fall my options for watching an Iowa football game live on television amount to 1) driving a half dozen miles to loiter at the nearest bar 2) driving twenty miles to Wal-Mart in hopes of catching a glimpse on one of the gee-whiz flat screens or 3) inviting myself over to a friend’s house an hour-plus away in Iowa City. And why should a rural Iowan like me face higher hurdles (logistically, financially, or circumstantially) to access Hawkeye sports than his city brethren? Wasn’t this leveling of the playing field between rural and urban part of the original impetus for public broadcasting in the first place? This fall I’ve found a fourth, no less awkward option for getting my Hawkeye football fix, courtesy of the Robin Hoods on YouTube. You see, I’m more than willing to watch the contest days after it’s happened … I’m that big a fan. And I don’t think the true fans who post on YouTube should have to risk legal sanction to visually connect Iowa fans with their state university (read: home) team. Maybe we’ve reached the point that an Iowa Sports Fan’s Bill of Rights is needed, one founded on the proposition. “It is the right of every citizen of Hawkeye Nation to view their team on public or network television.” • Zachary Michael Jack is a seventh-generation rural Midwesterner.

Image: Shutterstock EXPOSURE TO TINY doses of hormone-disrupting chemicals is responsible for at least $340 billion (€310 billion) in health-related costs each year in the US, according to a report published this week. So-called endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are found in thousands of everyday products, ranging from plastic and metal food containers, to detergents, flame retardants, toys and cosmetics. Neurological damage and behavioural problems, including attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism and loss of IQ, accounted for at least four-fifths of these impacts, researchers said. The study appeared in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology, a medical journal, and was carried out to try and quantify the economic benefits of different regulatory frameworks. The researchers said that exposure to EDCs varies widely between the US and the EU due to differences in regulations. The invisible, dangerous chemicals also boosted obesity, diabetes, some cancers, male infertility and a painful condition known as endometriosis, the abnormal growth of tissue outside the uterus. The economic impact of the chemicals leaves a huge, 2% dent in American gross domestic product (GDP) each year. The study noted that the disease costs of EDCs were much higher in the USA than in Europe, where they accounted for 1.28% of GDP. The study said: The difference was driven mainly by intelligence quotient (IQ) points loss and intellectual disability due to polybrominated diphenyl ethers. The USA experienced 11 million IQ points lost, compared to 873 000 IQ points lost in the EU, the study added. “Our research adds to the growing evidence on the tremendous economic as well as human health costs of endocrine-disrupting chemicals,” said lead investigator Leonardo Trasande, an associate professor at NYU Langone in New York City. He added: This has the potential to develop into a much larger health and economic issue if no policy action is taken. The body’s endocrine tissues produce essential hormones that help regulate energy levels, reproduction, growth, development, as well as our response to stress and injury. Mimicking naturally occurring hormones such as oestrogen and androgen, EDCs lock on to receptors within a human cell and block the body’s own hormones from binding with it. ‘Adverse consequences’ Recent research has raised red flags showing that “environmental contaminants can disrupt the endocrine system leading to adverse-health consequences,” according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Detergent. Source: Shutterstock In the US, the biggest chemical culprit by far among the thousands of manmade molecules suspected of interfering with human hormones are so-called PBDEs, found in flame retardants. Flame retardants refers to the function of certain groups of chemicals that are added to manufactured materials, including plastics, textiles, paints and varnishes in order to lessen the likelihood of a fire. Bisphenol A, used to line tin food cans, along with phthalates in plastic food containers and many cosmetics, were also held to be responsible for upward of $50 billion worth of health damages. A similar study concluded last year that health-related costs of EDCs in the European Union were some €150 billion, about 1.28% of GPD. Crucially, the main drivers of disease and disability were different on either side of the Atlantic, Trasande said. “US costs are higher mainly because of the widespread use in furniture of brominated flame retardants,” which were banned in the EU in 2008, he explained. The blood level of these chemicals in the average American would be in the top five percent of Europeans today. By contrast, the health costs associated with pesticides in food were 10 times higher in the EU than in the United States, where more stringent regulations were put in place to protect pregnant women and children. Shoppers choosing tins of food at a Walmart in Chinatown, LA. Source: AP/Press Association Images To put a figure on the impact of EDCs, the researchers reviewed blood and urine samples from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which has gathered data since 2009 on major disease risk factors from 5,000 volunteers. Computer models were then used to project how much each of 15 diseases or conditions was attributable to chemical exposure, and the estimated health costs for each one. Loss of IQ Flame retardants and pesticides in particular are known to affect the developing brain and can lead to loss of IQ. “Each IQ point lost corresponds to approximately two percent in lost productivity,” Trasande explained. The costs and benefits of regulation should be openly debated, the authors argued, citing the decision in the 1970s to ban lead in paint, and then 20 years later in gasoline. Commenting in the same journal, Michele La Merrill, an expert in environmental toxicology at the University of California in Davis, said the new findings “provide a lesson on the lasting economic effects of harmful chemicals.” They should “inspire a policy shift to end the cat-and-mouse game currently employed the US government and industry.” The EU set broad criteria in June for identifying potentially harmful EDCs, but consumer and environmental groups said they fell far short of what is needed. - © AFP, 2016, with reporting from Darragh Peter Murphy.

Ogg October 21, 2016 8:55 am EST Print Email Tweet Stocks were indicated lower on Friday as earnings looked mixed. So far, earnings season has gotten off to a decent start, and investors still seem willing and able to buy each pullback. This appetite for stocks is despite high valuations and a seven-and-a-half-year-old bull market. Investors are also looking for new ideas to generate gains or income ahead. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each morning. The goal is to find new investing and trading ideas for our readers. Some analyst research reports cover stocks to buy, and some feature stocks to sell or avoid. These are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Friday morning: AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) was reiterated as Buy with a $48 price target (versus a $39.38 prior close) at Jefferies. The firm sees a Time Warner merger as unlikely. Wedbush Securities reiterated its Neutral rating on Time Warner but said its view of a merger is low. AT&T has a 52-week trading range of $32.22 to $43.89 and a consensus analyst price target of $42.61. Chesapeake Energy Corp. (NYSE: CHK) had its investor day on Thursday. Merrill Lynch raised its rating to Neutral from Underperform with a $10 price objective, and Nomura raised its rating to Neutral from Reduce. The 52-week range is $1.50 to $8.15, and the consensus price target is $6.50. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ: LULU) was maintained as Hold at Jefferies, but the price target was cut to $61 from $76 (versus a $58.58 close). It has a 52-week range of $43.14 to $81.81 and consensus price target of $70.66. Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) was hitting new all-time highs and up 5.85% at $60.60 on Friday after earnings beat expectations. The stock was raised to Outperform from Market Perform by William Blair. Jefferies maintained its Underperform rating but raised its target to $43 from $40. The previous 52-week range is $48.04 to $58.70, and the consensus price target of $59.79. PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL) was reiterated as Buy with a $48 price target (versus a $40.24 close) at Jefferies. Stifel raised it to Buy from Hold. Wedbush reiterated its Outperform rating and raised its price target to $54 from $50. Credit Suisse reiterated its Outperform rating and raised its target price to $47 from $43. PayPal has a 52-week range of $30.52 to $41.75 and consensus price target of $44.94. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) was started with a Neutral rating and assigned a $73 price target (versus a $68.73 close) at Piper Jaffray. The 52-week range is $67.07 to $73.19. The consensus price target is $74.92. Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO) was downgraded to Hold from Buy at Jefferies. What is interesting here is that there is still upside called for with a price target of $48, and the firm sees an upside to $66 and a downside to $30. Yahoo has a 52-week range of $26.15 to $44.92 and a consensus price target of $45.28.

There will be three Hell in a Cell matches on the same show (one of them featuring women for the first time—kind of a big deal), something that hasn’t been done in seven years. Will any of them be good? Odds are one of them will hit the mark, but they’ll pale in comparison to the match’s glory days. You know, the days when the Cell was the “in case of fire, break glass” option? For example, this week’s Live Retro Blog. If the picture hasn’t spoiled it for you, I of course am referring to the King of the Ring 1998, taking place on June 28, 1998 from the Pittsburgh Civic Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Simply put, it remains to this day one of the most memorable nights in WWE history. In addition to the aforementioned Hell in a Cell match between longtime rivals Undertaker and Mankind, there is (as the title implies) the conclusion of King of the Ring tournament. WWF Intercontinental Champion The Rock will face NWA World Heavyweight Champion Dan Severn in one semifinal, while Ken Shamrock will face three-time Intercontinental Champion Jeff Jarrett in the other semifinal. The two winners will face off later in the show for the right to be called King of the Ring. But wait, kids! There’s more. We might see someone get burned alive tonight. No, seriously. In a WWF first, Stone Cold Steve Austin will face Kane in a first blood match with the WWF Championship on the line. If Kane is the first man to bleed, he will set himself on fire. Oh dear. Showtime for the Live Retro Blog is 7pm ET Saturday. That’s 6pm CT, 4pm PT, 1pm Hawaiian, 12 midnight in Britain. Everywhere else, figure it out. All you need’s a working broadband Internet connection (you’re on this site, so I assume you have one) and an active WWE Network subscription (you can get one here if you don’t have one. First month’s on the house if you’re new. Or if you haven’t subscribed in a while, probably). Or you can get a WWE Network subscription card at Gamestop or 7-11 or Wal-Mart or Best Buy if you don’t feel like giving out your credit card number. Note: as a word of caution, I can tell you that KOTR ’98 is one of the more gruesome shows in WWE history, so this might not be suitable for all members of the family. As with other live blogs, we’re treating this deal as it is live. Unlike other live blogs, pics and GIFs are ok, but only in moderation. Don’t abuse it, as this post will have to be refreshed frequently. Howzit? I’m Eddie Mac. Let’s watch some live retro wrestling. CONFIRMED MATCHES FIRST BLOOD MATCH FOR THE WWF CHAMPIONSHIP: Stone Cold Steve Austin [c] vs Kane (If Kane loses, he will set himself on fire.) KING OF THE RING SEMIFINAL: The Rock vs. Dan Severn KING OF THE RING SEMIFINAL: Jeff Jarrett vs. Ken Shamrock KING OF THE RING FINAL: Rock/Severn winner vs. Jarrett/Shamrock winner HELL IN A CELL MATCH: The Undertaker vs. Mankind Too Much (Scott Taylor & Brian Christopher) vs. Al Snow & Head (Jerry Lawler as special referee) X-Pac vs. Owen Hart WWF Attitude intro thing. Premonition and prophecy meets Austin 3:16 and Revelation. The WWF Championship first blood match. The Black Angel and the Descent of Mankind meet in Hell on Earth. Dear God, have mercy on their souls. Freddie Blassie's the best, ya'lls. Super Soaker presents King of the Ring. PYRO AND BALLYHOO! King of the Ring, June 28, 1998 from the Pittsburgh Civic Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 17,087 strong with 310,000 homes watching on PPV. FUTURE EDDIE ALERT! In an indication of just how hot WWF was at the time, that is over 130,000 more buys than the 1997 edition, and more home buys than Wrestlemanias XI and XII. It's also about 100,000 more homes than the previous month's Over the Edge. On the mic are Jim Ross and Jerry "The King" Lawler. And gas cans. Of course, the big stories are the Hell in a Cell match and the WWF title first blood match. Makes the King of the Ring, you know, the name of this here PPV, almost irrelevant. Onward! Match 1: Taka Michinoku and the Headbangers defeat Kaientai in 6:44. First of two late additions to the card. Taka Michinoku Drivers Funaki to give the good guys the win. Make Taka look really, really strong, even if the division in which he is the champion of isn't. Hey, at least the crowd's awake, which is all you can ask. -- Sable's back, everyone. She was fired, but then unfired. Yeah, not gonna try and hurt my head over it. Crowd loves them some Sable though. Anyway, she introduces Vince McMahon and the Stooges. Pat Patterson tries to feel Sable up for some reason and rightfully gets five across the face from her. McMahon disrespects the crowd (many of whom wanna see Kane get set on fire--including former heavyweight boxing champion Michael Moorer), even accusing them of lousy DNA syndrome. And it's their fault their life sucks. Time filler to fill time. -- We get a look at the final four for the King of the Ring. The Rock (who defeated Vader and Triple H) will take on Dan Severn (who beat D-Lo Brown and Owen Hart, both by submission). On the opposite side, Ken Shamrock (who beat Kama Mustafa and Mark Henry) will face Jeff Jarrett (who beat Faarooq and Marc Mero). Semifinals now, winners meet later. -- Match 2: Ken Shamrock defeated Jeff Jarrett by submission in 5:29 to advance to the King of the Ring final.Shamrock taps out Jeff Jarrett despite Ken coming into the bout with a bum ankle thanks to the Nation of Domination. Live shot of outside the Pittsburgh Civic Center. Overcast skies and a wacky waving inflatable Undertaker. King of the Ring's sold out, by the way. Match 3: The Rock defeated Dan Severn in 4:24 to advance to the King of the Ring final. In the first round, it was Severn that injured D-Lo's pectoral muscles, prompting Brown to wear a chest protector for a lot longer than necessary. Godfather distracts the referee, D-Lo frog splashes Severn with the chest protector, and The Rock by hook or crook defeats the NWA world champion. Granted that belt didn't mean much, but still, he beat an NWA world champion on PPV. -- A recap of Al Snow trying to get re-hired in the WWF after an excursion over in ECW. Oh, and Al's companion Head. Anyway, Jerry Lawler said he'll hook up Al with a meeting with Vince if he could beat Too Much in a match. Oh, two things: Al Snow's partner is Head, and Lawler's the referee. Match 4: Too Much defeat Al Snow and Head in 8:24. Snow hit the Snowplow on Taylor, but Lawler refuses to count, as Head is somehow legal. Lawler grabs a bottle of Head and Shoulders and Christopher covers Head with the bottle of Head and Shoulders. Because the Shoulders were down, you see. Also, this match was eight and a half minutes. It's the longest on the show to this point. Where's my slug? Thanks. A recap of X-Pac vs. Owen Hart as a part of the on-going war between the two surviving factions of the GANG RULZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ era: D-Generation X and The Nation. Match 5: X-Pac defeated Owen Hart in 8:30. Good match. I mean, good outside of Mark Henry and Vader for some reason interfering. And Chyna. Small nugget: these two met at King of the Ring back in 1994, and even though it's only three and a half minutes, it's worth looking up if you got the time. But still, good match. -- Here's Paul Bearer. He got beat up at his home by Undertaker last week. Paul talks about life at home, and it damn near contradicts the whole Undertaker-Kane storyline history (though that has been contradicted so many times, you'd think it was running for office or something). Anyway, Bearer's rooting for Kane. Also, Paul Bearer is a bad father. — Match 6: The New Age Outlaws defeated The New Midnight Express in 9:34 to retain the WWF Tag Team Championship. The second of two bonus matches on the show. A match that happened. Also. Chyna nuts Jim Cornette. Probably would have been better served as following a later match on the card as a cooldown. Hey, everyone, it's Triple H on commentary! Match 7: Ken Shamrock defeated The Rock by submission in 14:09 to win the King of the Ring tournament. This essentially served as the blowoff match for a feud that lasted about nine or ten months. Shamrock could never get over the hump that was The Rock due to interference or his own issues. A cathartic victory for "The World's Most Dangerous Man". — Match 8: Undertaker vs. Mankind in a Hell in a Cell match. Gonna give a play-by-play of this one. If this one is anything like the first Hell in a Cell on PPV (Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels at Badd Blood the previous October), then Mankind is in for a long evening. Mankind out first, and he's got a chair with him... and he's throwing it on top of the cell for some reason. Oh, he's climbing it. Oh... ok. Undertaker out next and now we see the plan come to action. Mankind's not coming down. He wants the Undertaker up there with him. "The pain that these two men are preparing to endure is inhuman," says JR. Undertaker is happy to oblige, but it's a trap! Mankind tries to punch Taker off. It didn't work. So Mankind goes to Plan B: take out Taker with the chair. As the two make their way to the other side of the cell, part of the ceiling gives way. Oh dear. This is a bad idea. Mind you, the two together weigh over 600 pounds. Mankind tries to suplex Undertaker, but the Deadman quickly counters and staggers Mankind. Then Undertaker grabs Mankind and just throws him off the cell. No, seriously. No big setup. Just grab and go. "GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY! GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY! THAT KILLED HIM!" "Oh my God!" "AS GOD AS MY WITNESS, HE IS BROKEN IN HALF!" Mankind is down, and it is bad. He was just thrown some sixteen feet from the top of the cell all the way to the floor with only the Spanish announce table to break his fall. Lawler is declaring this thing over. Three replays show just how devastating that fall is. Mankind is somehow moving, but he is hurting something terrible right now. Terry Funk rushes to Mankind's aid, as does Francois Petit, the WWE's resident doctor. Undertaker looks on from the edge of the cell. Another replay, this time in slow motion. Hundreds of hours of "learning how to fall" can't prepare you for a fall like that. Don't try that at home or anyone else's home or anywhere. Seriously. Don't do it. Just... don't. Some clown yells "finish the match", but it appears the match is done as the stretcher has come out. Even McMahon's despondent. I mean, we may have just witness the end of a career on PPV. Crowd chants for Undertaker. It appears the match has been stopped, and I'm guessing Undertaker is the winner. Undertaker climbs down as Mankind is being wheeled out... Mankind is to his feet. Just stay on the stretcher, dude and let the doctors do their job. Mankind is... Mankind is going back. MANKIND IS GOING BACK... OH SHIT, MANKIND IS GOING BACK UP THE CELL! UNDERTAKER IS GOING BACK UP! I guess we're doing this. Undertaker with a headbutt. Right hand. Undertaker has Mankind by the throat and chokeslam... THROUGH THE CELL. "GOOD GOD! GOOD GOD!" "That's it, he's dead." "WILL SOMEBODY STOP THE DAMN MATCH? ENOUGH'S ENOUGH! THE POOR SON OF A... HE'S BROKEN IN HALF!" Francois rushes back in with about a dozen officials. Undertaker comes down and the ring quickly clears out. Terry Funk tries to protect Mankind, but he gets chokeslammed too. Out of his shoes. Replay shows the chair came down on Mankind's face as he got chokeslammed. Undertaker going for his rope walk, but Mankind crotches Undertaker. Mankind smiles for a camera with a bloody mouth and... is that... is that a tooth up his nose? Eww. Mankind forearms Taker from the apron to the cell. Both men are in excruciating pain at this point. Mankind can't even lift the steps; his left shoulder may be dislocated. Bad news for him as Undertaker can lift the steps and he batters Mankind on the bum arm. It's a matter of time before Undertaker puts this away as Mankind can barely defend himself...until Undertaker nearly necks himself with a suicide dive. Mankind somehow's able to dodge it, and the deranged one his going after the open wound of the Deadman. They're in hell, and they seem to like it in hell. Mankind with a spike piledriver to Undertaker on the steel chair. It gets a near fall. That was the first attempt by either man to win the match. Mankind with a leg drop onto the chair on Undertaker's face, which by the way, is a bloody mess. Only two. Double arm DDT. Seriously, what is up Mankind's nose? How did it get there? Mankind retrieves a bag from under the ring. And there's thumbtacks in the bag. LOTS OF THUMBTACKS. Are you even serious right now? Mankind tries to knock Undertaker into the tacks, but Undertaker goozles Mankind. Guess what happens? Go on, guess. No, actually Mankind counters. Taker with a boot, looking for a Tombstone, but it's countered into a Mandible Claw. Undertaker in trouble. Arm goes down twice, but not a third time. And Undertaker's carrying Mankind on his back... oh dear. Oh dear. OH SHITOHSHITOHSHIT... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Mankind is backdropped onto the thumbtacks! And Mankind rolls into the thumbtacks! And Undertaker chokeslams Mankind on the thumbtacks. Of course he does. Undertaker with a tombstone piledriver, and Undertaker wins it in 17:08. Get some help for these men right now. They once again get the stretcher for Mankind, but he insists on walking to the back. A recap of how we got to the WWF title match, plus a pending conspiracy involving the Undertaker, Kane, and Mankind. Match 9: Kane defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin in a first blood match at 14:52 to win the WWF Championship. Mankind and the Undertaker came out during the match (I have no idea how considering the hell they went through not even a half hour earlier). Austin fights off Mankind and Kane. Undertaker looks to nail Mankind, but hits Austin. The chairshot busts Austin open. It took a moment for referee Earl Hebner to realize it before he calls it. And when the announcement’s made, people are about ready to riot and start fires. EDDIE MAC’S QUICK REVIEW So… this was a show and a half, yeah? The King of the Ring final four was almost a complete afterthought coming into the show, and very much a footnote afterwards. The Hell in a Cell match set the bar for the stipulation’s matches that will never be surpassed. That match alone makes this show worth a watch. The only blatant filler on the show are the two promos and the bonus matches, but even they have their place, even if the latter one was better served as a cooldown between the two main events. But seriously, watch this show. 8 out of 10 from yours truly. Also, Austin wins the title literally 24 hours later. And who was screwing with the cell’s controls during the title match? Seriously. SERIOUSLY. NOTE: No Live Retro Blog next week. Hell in a Cell weekend. Back in two weeks.

Photo Courtesy of Ali Inay, via Unsplash Ray’s Garden Grows I don’t like to waste food nor do I do it very often. But it seems I’m probably in the minority on that phenomenon. It’s only been in the past few years that I’ve given attention to and noticed others doing the same about a statistic which seems staggering – that 30 to 40 percent of the food which is produced with the intent to have humans eat it is wasted instead before it is consumed. The average American throws out 209 to 254 pounds of edible food per year – well over a half a pound per day. For livestock feed, farmers get concerned about the losses when they exceed single digit percentage points. Those losses, which are virtually inevitable, occur during harvesting, transportation, and storage. The waste of human food, which has been substantiated in many ways, including by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, has many dire implications – economic, social, and environmental. It’s also a tremendous waste of natural resources such as water, land, seed, and fertilizer. Original Awareness I first became aware of this shocking statistic in 2008 when an article was published on a 10-year research project at the University of Arizona to track food waste. The lead researcher indicated that at least 40 percent of the food that was grown is wasted. At the time, he estimated annual average losses of $590 directly incurred by a family of four and a loss of $43 billion per year within households alone in the United States. Numerous subsequent published articles and online entries on this topic typically refer to a 30 to 40 percent loss on food that was grown. As recently as September of this year, a Consumer Reports article stated that Americans discarded an average of 52 percent of the fresh produce that they purchased along with 50 percent of seafood, 22 percent of meat, and 20 percent of milk. Publicity for the annual World Food Day, which was observed on Sunday, Oct. 16, pointed out that on any given day about 800 million humans are undernourished. Based on the current world population, that’s a bit over 10 percent compared to the 30 to 40 percent waste of food. Worldwide Implications Does the frequently documented waste of food bother anyone? It should, especially in light of the predictions by many organizations that food production around the world would nearly have to double by 2050 because of an increase of 2 billion in the world’s population from the 7 billion today. I don’t understand those mathematical calculations. Even if they are correct, a great reduction in the waste of food would translate into having little or no need to boost food production. The latest online information indicates that 1.3 billion tons of food worth $750 billion are wasted world-wide every year – enough to feed hundreds of millions of people. In the United States for 2014, the food waste estimate was 133 billion pounds worth $161.6 billion. Of this, 97 percent went to landfills while only 3 percent was composted. One estimate is that within the United States food waste has increased 50 percent per capita since 1974. Another calculation indicates that 28 percent of the agricultural acres in the world are being used to grow food that is wasted. A reduction of 20 percent, not 20 percentage points, from the most recently estimated 40 percent food waste in the United States would provide enough food for 25 million people per year at a time when one in six Americans is categorized as “food insecure.” Personal Experiences My first attention-getting experience with a waste of prepared food came on a day of KP (kitchen patrol or kitchen police) duty at an Air Force base in Texas. Although they had been refrigerated and were certainly still edible, dozens of pies were discarded that day because an expiration date had arrived. The only redeeming point about that incident was learning that an area hog farmer was picking up the discarded pies to feed his animals. I have never worked in a supermarket but they are definitely one source of food waste. I don’t know how willing the owner/operators would be to share numbers or volumes but it would be interesting to ask. Anyone who has any doubts about food waste stemming from supermarkets need only go to the bio-digester at the University of Wisconsin – Oshkosh. It incinerates supermarket, cafeteria, and restaurant food wastes to produce heat and electric power for buildings on the campus (about 10 percent of the university’s power usage) and city-owned facilities. It was the first anaerobic bio-digester of its type installed in the western hemisphere. I visited there five years ago – shortly after the bio-digester opened. It was amazing and disheartening to see the dumped truckloads of discarded vegetables and fruits that were obtained from supermarkets in the Fox Cities area and Oshkosh. The greatest food waste that I can plead guilty to is with small tomatoes. That happened with yellow and red ones this year and a few years ago. At the occasion about a decade ago, I invited a food pantry to have its clients pick as many tomatoes as they could use but I was turned down because of client confidentiality rules. Other Observations Food waste was a topic that John Oliver tackled on his HBO “Last Week Tonight” show within the past year. He examined it from many perspectives. Video on Oliver’s program showed how perfectly edible peaches were left behind in California fruit groves because of slight physical defects. He also interviewed supermarket managers, learning that consumers tend to reject any fresh produce not appearing to be perfect in its physical condition and that’s it’s much easier and less expensive for supermarkets to push discarded produce out the backdoor and toward a landfill rather than distributing it to food pantries. Consumer rejection of produce not passing a beauty test is being addressed at a few Walmart and Whole Foods outlets, according to a recent report in Time magazine. They’re offering odd-looking, misshaped, or “ugly” produce such as apples or potatoes at discount prices. Another major source of food waste is in school cafeterias. U.S. Department of Agriculture rules require that meals have a certain nutrient balance, including items that students should eat but unfortunately choose not to. Who’s to blame for that? Another inherent problem leading to food waste is a misunderstanding of the meaning of “use by” or “best by” dates stated on labels. This does not mean that the food is no longer safe by that date. Only “expiration date” labels should be honored. Taking Action One institution which has taken notice of food waste is St. Norbert College (SNC) in De Pere, where about 2,200 meals are served per day in a campus cafeteria. A recent article detailed what measures it has taken to cope with food waste and what the results have been. Since August of 2014, a portion of the cafeteria organic waste has gone to an area farmer to feed livestock while some of the remainder goes to the UW – Oshkosh bio-digester. Food waste was reduced by 44 percent during the first year of the SNC initiative, less than a full garbage bag of waste is headed to a landfill after each meal, and about $1,000 is saved per year on landfill tipping fees and emptying of the on-campus trash compactor. In addition, the dining service which operates the SNC cafeteria donates prepared food to a local food pantry for feeding its volunteers – not its clients. There’s a legal restriction on offering prepared food to food pantry clients because it is perishable. One of the online entries about food waste lists 27 ways on how to reduce it. Another one offers eight steps on how to do it. Where do you fit on the percentage scale on food waste? Are you below 10 percent, at the average or 30 to 40, or above 50 percent? How much money do you squander on wasted food?

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) By ANNE D’INNOCENZIO, Associated Press Published: October 21, 2016, 7:54 PM A   A NEW YORK — Toy companies are working harder to think outside their usual box, offering more-inclusive items like dolls with disabilities, female superhero figures and characters with a range of skin tones. Many of the products breaking down the barriers started with smaller businesses, but big names like Mattel and Hasbro are getting into the game and offering lots more options this holiday season. What that means on the shelves is Barbies that have a greater variety of body types, eye colors and facial structures, a Lego mini-figure of a boy who uses a wheelchair, and an American Girl doll with accessories like a diabetes kit and arm crutches in addition to the hearing aids and service dogs it has offered before. Other items include coding toys, robots and circuit builder sets aimed at both girls and boys. Jennifer Weitzman, whose 5-year-old daughter Hannah has cochlear implants, has the American Girl doll with hearing aids and a Tinker Bell doll with a cochlear implant that Weitzman bought from a British site called ToyLikeMe.org. “She lit up when she was given them. She thinks it’s awesome that they have implants just like her,” said Weitzman, of Mount Kisco, N.Y. “For many kids, it helps them identify and makes them feel included.” The trend started a few years ago, pushed by parents who didn’t see enough diversity in the toy aisle and were turning to the internet or startups to find items. Increasingly, the inclusiveness in the toy aisle means dolls with disabilities. Toys R Us has carried an exclusive line since 2013 called Journey Girls, which includes a wheelchair and a crutch set. Its partnership with American Girl to carry the Truly Me collection starting this month will include dolls that also use crutches, diabetes kits and wheelchairs. While Lego has had larger figures before that use wheelchairs, the mini-figure introduced this year comes as part of the “Fun in the Park” set, mixed in with several figures that don’t. “The designers were thinking about what might you see in the park in the city,” said Lego spokesman Michael McNally. Lego mini-figures had been yellow so that children could imagine their own identity for the characters. “We’ve always been about helping kids find themselves,” McNally said. But in 2004, it introduced flesh tones when representing real-life personalities. Experts say it’s critical for children to play with toys that don’t perpetuate stereotypes about what’s considered beautiful. They say the toys children play with have lasting impressions on their careers and their confidence. “There’s been some good progress, but there is a lot of work that needs to be done,” said Elizabeth Sweet, a sociologist and lecturer at California State University in Sacramento, Calif. “Kids need to see themselves in the toys and objects they interact with.” For building toys, the company GoldieBlox, founded in 2012, was among the first to disrupt the pink aisle by offering construction sets aimed at girls. But it also realized it needed more racial diversity, and last fall introduced a black character called Ruby Rails and has since then added a Latina engineer called Valentina and other characters. Many experts have been closely watching the moves made by Mattel, particularly with its iconic Barbie, whose business has been rebounding amid a makeover after seeing its sales suffer. The nation’s largest toy maker launched the Barbie Fashionista collection last year that offered more skin tones, eye colors and facial structures. This year, it added three body types — curvy, petite and tall. It said those items have been doing well. Spokeswoman Michelle Chidoni says the company is also looking to add different body shapes to the Barbie career line and the Fairytale doll collection. Racial diversity important Racial diversity can also be key. American Girl, which is owned by Mattel, launched a doll this year whose story is that she is growing up in civil rights-era Detroit. Wal-Mart’s My Life As doll collection has expanded the number of skin shades available, and Hasbro is adding more skin tones to its Baby Alive doll for next year. Beyond introducing dolls and games that feature all kinds of characters, companies are starting to think differently about toys that have traditionally been aimed at boys or girls. The White House held a conference on gender stereotypes in media and the toys, drawing executives from major toy companies. Target Corp. phased out gender-based signage in the toy aisle last year. It also was for a time the exclusive seller of Mattel’s DC Super Hero Girls, including Wonder Woman and Batgirl, which were the first 6-inch action figures designed for girls. They join other female characters in the action figure aisle that include Black Widow and Star Wars heroine Rey, says Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of TTPM, an online toy review site. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is selling its first 18-inch boy doll this holiday season under the My Life As brand, and Hasbro plans to launch a boy doll under the Baby Alive brand next year. John Frascotti, president of Hasbro Brands, cited My Little Pony, which originally was aimed at girls, and Nerf, which was traditionally for boys. Hasbro found the brands attract both boys and girls, so three years ago, it launched Nerf Rebelle that was styled for girls. As for My Little Pony, it’s expanding into comic books, usually more a domain for boys. “We are focusing on storytelling and worrying less about gender,” he said.

The chemical spill at MGP Ingredients between 10th and 14th Streets south of Main Street created a dangerous fog and led to a number of evacuations. Jill Toyoshiba jtoyoshiba@kcstar.com A chemical leak at an Atchison, Kan., plant Friday morning was created by an “inadvertent” mixture of sodium hypochlorite and sulfuric acid, City Manager Trey Cocking said. The leak was reported shortly after 8 a.m. on Friday morning.) Contributed by Corie Dunn 1 of 3 i By Glenn E. Rice, grice@kcstar.com Katy Bergen kbergen@kcstar.com and Ian Cummings icummings@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Diann Funk, 50, didn’t think much of sirens she heard from her Atchison, Kan., home shortly after 9 a.m. Friday. Her curtains were closed, the windows shut and she couldn’t see the thick, white fog with the “chlorine” smell that surrounded her home. Minutes later, her husband, Stan, stumbled in the front door with the dogs, agitated, struggling to breathe and reeking of the same bleachy smell. The dachshunds, Poppers and Dexter, appeared to be short of breath, too, and Dexter began throwing up. “We could not see the trees in our yard,” Diann Funk said. “It was that thick. My husband could hardly breathe.” An apparently accidental mixture of sodium hypochlorite and sulfuric acid at the MGP Ingredients plant between 10th and 14th Streets created a dangerous chemical fog that covered downtown Atchison and sparked evacuations and highway shutdowns. The chemical plume dissipated on the outskirts of town within hours, leaving dozens injured in its wake. By the end of the day, at least 67 people received medical treatment at Atchison Hospital. Three were admitted, including one sent to intensive care for breathing problems. Twenty-one total patients were sent to Mosaic Life Care in nearby St. Joseph, Mo., for further treatment. Hospital workers there donned protective suits and set up a sanitary decontamination tent to clean the patients of chemicals in a restricted area of the facility. Of those, 18 were treated and released, three were being evaluated and treated Friday evening, and no patients were in intensive care. Five of the injured were city employees from police, fire and public works departments. It was unclear how many plant employees were affected. In a statement Friday afternoon after the chemical plume dissipated and an all-clear had been declared, MGP said it was “cooperating fully to investigate and ensure that all appropriate response actions are taken.” MGP said it also has hired outside experts to assist the investigation into the accident and the response to it. The MGP plant makes alcoholic beverages and food additives. It has operated in Atchison since 1941 and employs about 225 people at two locations. Friday’s chemical mishap was one of several major emergencies that have occurred at the distillery of wheat proteins and starches in recent years. A grain cement elevator exploded in April 2015, injuring four. A smaller explosion destroyed one wall of a production warehouse this past February. State and federal regulators have fined the company several times over the years for various failures, most of them concerning plant emissions unrelated to the type of accident that occurred Friday. In 2006, the company was fined $26,000 for not having the emission-control devices required by the Environmental Protection Agency. A $22,000 penalty came in 2009 for failure to comply with a consent agreement on performance testing. Failure to comply with emissions caps brought a $5,000 fine in 2010 and a $6,000 fine last year. Atchison City Manager Trey Cocking said the incident Friday occurred just after 8 a.m. when a tanker truck delivered chemicals into the wrong tank. The two chemicals are well known to be dangerous when mixed. The chemical reaction created a plume of thick fog that covered a portion of downtown and traveled north and then west, as the wind shifted, officials said. Kansas Highway Patrol troopers followed the shifting cloud by helicopter until it dispersed. Residents outside the plume area were asked to evacuate and avoid the area north of MGP. People were advised through the radio and social media to avoid that area. Residents of Atchison who lived north of MGP were told to stay inside with their doors and windows shut and turn off their heating and cooling systems. Ted Graf, the interim fire chief for Atchison, said emergency responders used large amounts of water to dilute the mixture and allow the plume to dissipate. He said inhalation of the gas can cause upper respiratory problems, and people with asthma or other lung-related issues would be the most affected by exposure. Students from Atchison High School, middle schools and alternative schools were evacuated to Wal-Mart, while students at the elementary school were told to shelter in place, said Atchison Public School District Superintendent Susan Myers. The Atchison County Courthouse was evacuated, and classes at Benedictine College were also canceled. At one point, Cocking said, authorities considered evacuating the entire city of 11,000. But by 11 a.m., emergency responders said the situation was under control and an all-clear was issued. “It was a large-volume plume that enveloped a large area of the city,” Graf said. “We are very fortunate at this time that there were not more injuries.” The Funks live seven blocks north of the plant. On Friday morning, Funk said, it was a clear, sunny day when her husband left the house to walk the dogs at a local park. At the dog park, he was hit with a chlorinelike smell. “All of sudden, it started getting worse,” Funk said. “One of the dogs was coughing. By the time he got the dogs hooked up and back out on the street, he wasn’t sure he wasn’t going to make it back.” Brent Schuler, general manager of the Taco John’s on South 10th Street, said he and his employees saw the plume before they eventually smelled it. They watched emergency management crews roll on to the street and wanted to know what was going on. “The only thing that went through my mind was, ‘I want to get the heck out of here if it’s something serious,’ ” Schuler said. “I got my employees out.” Sodium hypochlorite is essentially household bleach and should not be mixed with any other chemical unless “adequate engineering controls and personal protective equipment are in place,” according to the Chlorine Institute, based in Arlington, Va. “Accidental mixing may cause dangerous conditions that could result in injury to personnel and/or damage to property or the environment,” the institute advises. Mixing sodium hypochlorite with sulfuric acid results in the release of hydrogen chloride, said Jerry Ray Dias, distinguished professor of chemistry and medicine at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. It would also likely create some chlorine gas, he said. When it reacts with moisture in the atmosphere, it would form a mist. “As it drifts, it is being diluted,” Dias said. After the all-clear, the Atchison Fire Department advised people returning to their homes and businesses to use caution. “If you notice a strong bleach odor or visible fog, please call 911 so that the Fire Department can assist with ventilating your home or business,” fire officials advised. Atchison Hospital sent out a release reminding people to take Benadryl, take a shower and stay in a cool place if they experience minor symptoms, such as a sore throat, minor headache and nasal congestion. Those with symptoms such as difficulty breathing, wheezing or other severe symptoms should seek medical attention, it said. In its Friday afternoon news release, MGP Ingredients said the company had reported the incident to the EPA and Kansas and local authorities. “There was no significant damage to its Atchison plant as a result of this incident,” the company said.

Their conditions have not been released. (Dougal Brownlie/The St. Joseph News-Press via AP) ATCHISON, Kan. (AP) — A chemical spill at a northeast Kansas distilling plant released a noxious cloud of fumes Friday, forcing temporary evacuations and sending dozens of people to the hospital, including two who were in intensive care, officials said. Most of the people who went to hospitals had been released by Friday afternoon. The spill occurred at the MGP Ingredients plant in Atchison, according to Katie Horner, spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Emergency Management. She said the spill occurred as two chemicals, sulfuric acid and sodium hypochlorite, were mistakenly combined at the plant, which produces premium distilled spirits and employs about 300 people. When the two chemicals combine they can release chlorine gas, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Homes and schools near the plant had been evacuated early Friday, but city officials gave the all clear for residents to return before noon. Atchison has about 11,000 residents and is about 50 miles northwest of Kansas City. "The threat is really over, and it's safe to be outside," said Becky Berger, assistant city manager. She advised residents to air out homes that smell like a swimming pool. Sixty-seven people sought medical attention at the Atchison Hospital emergency room, spokeswoman T.C. Roberts said, and one person remained in stable condition in intensive care late Friday afternoon. Most had been released, but two other people were admitted to the hospital. Mosaic Life Care in nearby St. Joseph, Missouri, also treated about 18 people, including one who remained in ICU Friday afternoon, said Joey Austin, hospital spokeswoman. All the others were released. The regional EPA office said it was supporting state and local emergency crews and had sent a coordinator to the site to assess the situation. MGP didn't immediately return calls seeking comment. Chris Gitro, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said wind conditions helped the plume break up. "The one thing we had on our side was that the winds were enough to make it disperse," he said. Pinpointing the cloud's direction proved to be a guessing game while it was still in Atchison. As one school building's students sought shelter in the gymnasium, students in the other three buildings were shuttled in buses first toward a Wal-Mart before being redirected to the local airport, schools Superintendent Susan Myers said. The buses were eventually directed again to Wal-Mart, she said. "They were trying to figure out the wind, where this cloud was going. It was a very fluid situation," she said. "I would say it was very anxiety-provoking to have this kind of situation. I'm sure this was an adventuresome day for everyone." The MGP plant has also had other incidents, including a small explosion in another building in February where no injuries were reported, City Manager Trey Cocking said. The plant was also the site of a 2002 explosion and fire that damaged the plant's distillery and injured a few people. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment said that since 2006 the company has faced more than $50,000 in penalties for issues including exceeding its air pollution cap and failing to install emissions devices. The company is currently in full compliance, according to the department.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Toy companies break down barriers to be more inclusive Friday Oct 21, 2016 at 7:00 PM Toy companies are working harder to think outside their usual box, offering more-inclusive items like dolls with disabilities, female superhero figures and characters with a range of skin tones. The Associated Press NEW YORK — Toy companies are working harder to think outside their usual box, offering more-inclusive items like dolls with disabilities, female superhero figures and characters with a range of skin tones. Many of the products breaking down the barriers started with smaller businesses, but big names like Mattel and Hasbro are getting into the game and offering lots more options this holiday season. What that means on the shelves is Barbies that have a greater variety of body types, eye colors and facial structures, a Lego mini-figure of a boy who uses a wheelchair, and an American Girl doll with accessories like a diabetes kit and arm crutches in addition to the hearing aids and service dogs it has offered before. Other items include coding toys, robots and circuit builder sets aimed at both girls and boys. Jennifer Weitzman, whose 5-year-old daughter Hannah has cochlear implants, has the American Girl doll with hearing aids and a Tinker Bell doll with a cochlear implant that Weitzman bought from a British site called ToyLikeMe.org. "She lit up when she was given them. She thinks it's awesome that they have implants just like her," said Weitzman, of Mount Kisco, New York. "For many kids, it helps them identify and makes them feel included." The trend started a few years ago, pushed by parents who didn't see enough diversity in the toy aisle and were turning to the internet or startups to find items. Increasingly, the inclusiveness in the toy aisle means dolls with disabilities. Toys R Us has carried an exclusive line since 2013 called Journey Girls, which includes a wheelchair and a crutch set. Its partnership with American Girl to carry the Truly Me collection starting this month will include dolls that also use crutches, diabetes kits and wheelchairs. While Lego has had larger figures before that use wheelchairs, the mini-figure introduced this year comes as part of the "Fun in the Park" set, mixed in with several figures that don't. "The designers were thinking about what might you see in the park in the city," said Lego spokesman Michael McNally. Lego mini-figures had been yellow so that children could imagine their own identity for the characters. "We've always been about helping kids find themselves," McNally said. But in 2004, it introduced flesh tones when representing real-life personalities. Experts say it's critical for children to play with toys that don't perpetuate stereotypes about what's considered beautiful. They say the toys children play with have lasting impressions on their careers and their confidence. "There's been some good progress, but there is a lot of work that needs to be done," said Elizabeth Sweet, a sociologist and lecturer at California State University in Sacramento, California. "Kids need to see themselves in the toys and objects they interact with." For building toys, the company GoldiBlox, founded in 2012, was among the first to disrupt the pink aisle by offering construction sets aimed at girls. But it also realized it needed more racial diversity, and last fall introduced a black character called Ruby Rails and has since then added a Latina engineer called Valentina and other characters. Many experts have been closely watching the moves made by Mattel, particularly with its iconic Barbie, whose business has been rebounding amid a makeover after seeing its sales suffer. The nation's largest toy maker launched the Barbie Fashionista collection last year that offered more skin tones, eye colors and facial structures. This year, it added three body types — curvy, petite and tall. It said those items have been doing well. Spokeswoman Michelle Chidoni says the company is also looking to add different body shapes to the Barbie career line and the Fairytale doll collection. Racial diversity can also be key. American Girl, which is owned by Mattel, launched a doll this year whose story is that she is growing up in civil rights-era Detroit. Wal-Mart's My Life As doll collection has expanded the number of skin shades available, and Hasbro is adding more skin tones to its Baby Alive doll for next year. Beyond introducing dolls and games that feature all kinds of characters, companies are starting to think differently about toys that have traditionally been aimed at boys or girls. The White House held a conference on gender stereotypes in media and the toys, drawing executives from major toy companies. Target Corp. phased out gender-based signage in the toy aisle last year. It also was for a time the exclusive seller of Mattel's D.C. Super Hero Girls, including Wonder Woman and Batgirl, which were the first 6-inch action figures designed for girls. They join other female characters in the action figure aisle that include Black Widow and Star Wars heroine Rey, says Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of TTPM, an online toy review site. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is selling its first 18-inch boy doll this holiday season under the My Life As brand, and Hasbro plans to launch a boy doll under the Baby Alive brand next year. John Frascotti, president of Hasbro Brands, cited My Little Pony, which originally was aimed at girls, and Nerf, which was traditionally for boys. Hasbro found the brands attract both boys and girls, so three years ago, it launched Nerf Rebelle that was styled for girls. As for My Little Pony, it's expanding into comic books, usually more a domain for boys. "We are focusing on storytelling and worrying less about gender," he said.

Riverside Mission celebrates ceiling renovations ___ $47 billion offer to create world's biggest tobacco company LONDON (AP) — British American Tobacco has offered to buy out Reynolds American Inc. for $47 billion in an attempt to gain a strong presence in the U.S., a lucrative market where sales of electronic cigarettes are booming as traditional smoking fades. The takeover would create the world's largest publicly traded tobacco company and combine BAT's presence in developing countries, where anti-smoking campaigns are not as strong as in the U.S. and Europe, with Reynolds' almost exclusive focus on the U.S. ___ US internet repeatedly disrupted by cyberattacks on key firm LONDON (AP) — Cyberattacks on a key internet firm repeatedly disrupted the availability of popular websites across the United States Friday, according to analysts and company officials. The White House described the disruption as malicious. Dyn Inc. said its server infrastructure was hit by distributed denial-of-service attacks, which work by overwhelming targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attack had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites from across America and Europe, including Twitter, Netflix and Sony's PlayStation Network. ___ Japan overwork deaths among young show lessons unlearned TOKYO (AP) — Despite efforts over the past two decades to cut back on overwork, "karoshi" or death from overwork, still causes hundreds of deaths and illnesses every year in Japan. It affects all sorts of workers, from elite salaried employees to technicians and manual labourers. In Japan's corporate world, company interests tend to come first and employees are ill-placed to resist pressure to take on too much work. The Labor Standards Law sets a 40-hour workweek but a loophole for voluntary ceilings on overtime makes the law toothless, experts say. ___ US stocks close mostly lower; eke out gain for the week The major U.S. stock indexes closed mostly lower Friday, capping a day spent wavering between small gains and losses. Phone companies were the biggest drag on the market following reports that AT&T was considering a deal to acquire the media conglomerate Time Warner. Health care and energy stocks also took some losses, while consumer staples and technology companies held on to slight gains. Investors continued to focus on corporate America, reviewing earnings from General Electric, McDonald's and other big companies. Earnings from banks and other financial companies have been mostly better than anticipated, which has helped boost that sector. ___ McDonald's sales rise 1.3 per cent at US stores NEW YORK (AP) — The launch of all-day breakfast helped McDonald's record higher sales at established U.S. locations for a fifth straight quarter, but the boost from that is shrinking and the company is hoping new menu items and recipe tweaks will keep customers coming back. McDonald's said sales rose 1.3 per cent at established U.S. locations in the third quarter, matching what Wall Street analysts expected. That's down from the 1.8 per cent rise the world's biggest burger chain reported in the previous quarter. Worldwide, sales grew 3.5 per cent at established locations, far exceeding the 1.3 per cent growth analysts were expecting, according to FactSet. ___ Let's toast: Jim Beam strike ends with promise to expand LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Jim Beam ended a nearly weeklong strike at two bourbon distilleries in Kentucky on Friday, toasting a labour settlement that answers the workers' key demand with a commitment to hire more full-time staff. Union members picketing since last Saturday approved the company's latest contract offer on a 204-19 vote and will resume producing whiskey Monday, said United Food and Commercial Workers union official Tommy Ballard. ___ Canada walks out as EU trade talks founder BRUSSELS (AP) — Canada walked out of talks Friday meant to save a massive trade deal with the European Union, unable to break a deadlock with a small Belgian region that has been defying multinational efforts to have the pact signed next week. Canadian International Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland said it had been impossible to overcome the differences with Wallonia, a French-speaking region of barely 3.5 million people. Despite the stunning setback, European officials refused to accept that the pact, which had been agreed on provisionally two years ago, could not be saved. The impasse, however, raises troubling questions about the 28-nation EU's ability to negotiate major international agreements. ___ NY enacts restrictions on Airbnb, with fines of up to $7,500 ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New York state enacted one of the nation's toughest restrictions on Airbnb on Friday with a new law authorizing fines of up to $7,500 for many short-term rentals. The measure signed into law by Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo applies to rentals of fewer than 30 days when the owner or tenant is not present. Supporters of the measure say many property owners use sites like Airbnb to offer residential apartments as short-term rentals to visitors, hurting existing hotels while taking residential units off the already expensive housing market in New York City. ___ Bombardier to cut 7,500 jobs globally over the next 2 years MONTREAL (AP) — Bombardier will cut 7,500 jobs around the world over the next two years as it tries to turn around its business. The airplane and train maker said Friday that the reductions are part of a plan to restore it to profitability by 2020. Its plans to eliminate 7,500 positions — more than 10 per cent of its global workforce — through the end of 2018, are on top of 7,000 positions Bombardier already planned to eliminate by the end of 2017. ___ Wal-Mart invests $50M in China's online grocery business NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart is investing $50 million in New Dada, China's largest online grocery and logistics company, as it moves to strengthen its foothold in the nation's fiercely competitive food market. The move, announced late Thursday, is an extension of Wal-Mart's pact with JD.com, China's no. 2 e-commerce site. New Dada, partly owned by JD.com, has more than 25 million registered customers and delivers to more than 300 cities. China is a key growth market for Wal-Mart. ___ Tesla may enter ride ride-hailing business next year DETROIT (AP) — Electric car maker Tesla Motors has plans to get into the ride-hailing and sharing businesses. The company hinted at the venture earlier this week when it announced that all of its cars would come equipped with hardware needed to drive themselves. The company says in a disclaimer that use of self-driving Teslas to make money with ride-hailing or sharing will be allowed only on Tesla's own network. Details will be released next year. A Tesla spokeswoman wouldn't comment on the matter. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16.64 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 18,145.71. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slipped 0.18 points, or 0.01 per cent, to 2,141.16. The Nasdaq composite index gained 15.57 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 5,257.40. In other U.S. energy futures trading, wholesale gasoline added 4 cents to $1.53 a gallon, while heating oil gained a penny to $1.57 a gallon. Natural gas lost 15 cents, or 4.7 per cent, to $2.99 per 1,000 cubic feet. Organizations: British American Tobacco, McDonald's, Reynolds American Inc.

CDT October 21, 2016 Trey Cocking, the city manager of Atchison, Kan., addresses the media after a chemical incident occurred at the MPG Ingredients plant on Friday Oct. 21, 2016, in Atchison, Kan.    (Photo: Dougal Brownlie, The St. Joseph News-Press via AP) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST A plant that makes bourbon, whiskey, gin and other distilled spirits accidentally concocted a chemical cocktail that spewed a dangerous fog over Atchison, Kan., on Friday. The floating cloud that smelled strongly of bleach sent dozens of people to the hospital, spurred evacuations and closed major highways. A local emergency room treated at least 26 people for respiratory issues. The chemical fog developed around 8 a.m. after workers at the MGP Ingredients' sewage facility inadvertently mixed two unknown chemicals. "No fire, no explosion, just a plume developed when two chemicals were mixed with each other," City Manager Trey Cocking said at a press conference. The plume of smoke from the spill floated over the city and prompted officials to urge residents to stay indoors. ​Area schools evacuated thousands of students to a local Wal-Mart or the airport. City authorities said the gas cloud smelled strongly of bleach. The Kansas Department of Transportation closed U.S. Highways 59 and 73 and Kansas Highway 7. The department reopened the roads about 11 a.m. as the cloud moved along the river channel and dissipated, spokeswoman Kim Qualls said. The Kansas Highway Patrol used its helicopters to track the plume as it hovered over downtown Atchison and then floated west, Cocking said. "Atchison residents: please shelter in place. If you are not in Atchison, please stay out of town," the Atchison County Emergency Management office wrote in a notice on its Facebook page. City officials issued the all clear nearly three hours later after the cloud dissipated. Couldn't figure out if it was fog or the chemical cloud #Atchison #mgpexplosion pic.twitter.com/MPUOYyqmYn— Megan Laflin (@Meglaflin) October 21, 2016 A local, Corie Dunn, sent a drone high up over the chemical plume in #Atchison to get a birds-eye view of the leak. pic.twitter.com/rmjg2HDYFP— Brian Ries (@moneyries) October 21, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS 4-year-old killed as mom is robbed Search for missing mother from Spring Woman and children shot, 4-year-old dead Woman accused of punching police horse faces judge HISD trustee's tweet compares Trump to Hitler Mother accused of stashing exotic animals Cy-Fair ISD teacher charged with sexual assault Woman shot and killed in home near Katy Is your vehicle on a recall list?

(Source: Gaffney PD) GAFFNEY, SC (FOX Carolina) - Officers at the Gaffney Police Department said they're searching for two shoplifting suspects, one of which reportedly followed a young girl into a supermarket restroom and violated her privacy. According to reports, on Thursday around 9:45 p.m. a 14-year-old girl went into the women's restroom of a Gaffney Walmart when a man followed her inside. After the teen entered a restroom stall, the man reportedly entered the stall next to hers, stood on the toilet, peered over the divider at her and made a comment to her.  Police say the man along with a second suspect were in the Walmart shoplifting clothing which they used to disguise their appearance when leaving. A gray Dodge Pickup truck was captured on surveillance as the vehicle driven by the suspects. On Tuesday officers identified the suspects as two men from Kentucky. The suspect accused of peeping Tom was identified as Jerry Lee Conner. The suspect accused of shoplifting was identified as Tommy Maynard. Anyone with information in this case is asked to contact Detective Sgt. Brian Blanton at 864-206-3334. Copyright 2016 FOX Carolina (Meredith Corporation). All rights reserved.

The Make A Difference Day Food Drive continues Saturday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Dropoff points are: Graham Automall, 1515 W. Fourth St.; Mansfield-area Kroger stores; Area Agency on Aging at Hawkins Corner, Ontario; and OhioHealth Mansfield Hospital. Make A Difference Day food drive organizer Doc Stumbo of Graham Automall said Friday he was getting reports from volunteers stocking and boxing the donations that the number of items was up from last year. No final count of food items donated will be available until Sunday, Stumbo said. He said donations last year totaled more than 18,000 items; in 2014, more than 24,000 items were collected. "A really nice lady brought a carload of food today. She said she used a food pantry a couple years ago and wanted to repay the favor," he said.

The drive continues Saturday at various dropoff points.  (Photo: Lou Whitmire/News Journal) Miss Ohio Alice Magoto of Cincinnati worked side-by-side with volunteers in her high heels and crown in the Graham Automall building on West Fourth Street that was formerly an Aldi's. She  said she enjoyed helping at the event, her first Make A Difference Day effort since winning the state pageant in June at the Renaissance Theatre. InfoCision challenged Catalyst Life Services to compete and see which organization could contribute the most food. Aaron Rasmus, call center manager at InfoCision, Friday said InfoCision won the challenge, collecting 2,500 items and raising  $200, which is part of their corporate match. Startek employees dropped off 1,535 items in two vehicles Friday morning, with employees saying they wanted to give back to the community.

The food drive continues Saturday.  (Photo: Lou Whitmire/News Journal) Many individual residents dropped off canned goods. Phyllis Lybarger of Shelby stopped by to help donate cash for the food drive. "I believe in giving back, but couldn't go to the grocery store," she said. AFL-CIO, laborers and electrical workers brought a pickup loaded with canned goods and employees from  Walmart  on Lexington-Springmill Road had fruits, vegetables, spaghetti sauce and more. Donations will be divided evenly among six local food pantries — Salvation Army, Domestic Violence Shelter, Volunteers of America, Harmony House, Catholic Charities and Butler-Clear Fork Nutrition. Sponsors are Graham Automall, News Journal Media, WRGM, 99.3 The Light, MIX 106, WMFD TV 68, Y105, MY100, The Fox, WMAN and RSVP of Mid Ohio. Stumbo said clients of Newhope, employees of the News Journal and members of the local Young Marines helped box and load the various food items. Any individual or business wishing to participate may call Stumbo at 419-529-1800, or fax him at 419-529-1887.

Updated: November 15, 2016 @ 4:54 pm Full Forecast News Huskers Obituaries Mugshots Buy & Sell AP Chemical cloud over Kansas community dissipates The Associated Press Oct 21, 2016 (…) ATCHISON, Kan. — A chemical spill at a northeast Kansas distilling plant released a noxious cloud of fumes Friday, forcing temporary evacuations and sending more than 50 people to the hospital, including one person who was in intensive care, officials said. The spill occurred at the MGP Ingredients plant in Atchison, according to Katie Horner, spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Emergency Management. She said the spill occurred as two chemicals, sulfuric acid and sodium hypochlorite, were mistakenly combined at the plant, which produces premium distilled spirits and employs about 300 people. Homes and schools near the plant had been evacuated early Friday, but city officials gave the all clear for residents to return before noon. Atchison has about 11,000 residents and is about 50 miles northwest of Kansas City. "The threat is really over, and it's safe to be outside," said Becky Berger, assistant city manager. She advised residents to air out homes that smell like a swimming pool. Fifty-two people sought medical attention at the Atchison Hospital emergency room, spokeswoman T.C. Roberts said, and one person remained in intensive care Friday afternoon. She said they were treated for upper respiratory discomfort. Roberts said she didn't know whether the person in the ICU was a plant employee. She also did not know how many people had been released, but that the hospital was following a protocol that included monitoring them for several hours. Patients were being released when appropriate, Roberts said. The regional office of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it was supporting state and local emergency crews and had sent a coordinator to the site to assess the situation. MGP didn't immediately return calls seeking comment. Chris Gitro, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said wind conditions helped the plume break up. "The one thing we had on our side was that the winds were enough to make it disperse," he said. Pinpointing the cloud's direction proved to be a guessing game while it was still in Atchison. As one school building's students sought shelter in the gymnasium, students in the other three buildings were shuttled in buses first toward a Wal-Mart before being redirected to the local airport, schools Superintendent Susan Myers said. The buses were eventually directed again to Wal-Mart, she said. "They were trying to figure out the wind, where this cloud was going. It was a very fluid situation," she said. "I would say it was very anxiety-provoking to have this kind of situation. I'm sure this was an adventuresome day for everyone."

The Associated Press Published Friday, Oct. 21, 2016 5:39PM EDT Last updated Friday, Oct. 21, 2016 5:39PM EDT Comments AA ___ $47 billion offer to create world's biggest tobacco company LONDON (AP) — British American Tobacco has offered to buy out Reynolds American Inc. for $47 billion in an attempt to gain a strong presence in the U.S., a lucrative market where sales of electronic cigarettes are booming as traditional smoking fades. The takeover would create the world's largest publicly traded tobacco company and combine BAT's presence in developing countries, where anti-smoking campaigns are not as strong as in the U.S. and Europe, with Reynolds' almost exclusive focus on the U.S. ___ US internet repeatedly disrupted by cyberattacks on key firm LONDON (AP) — Cyberattacks on a key internet firm repeatedly disrupted the availability of popular websites across the United States Friday, according to analysts and company officials. The White House described the disruption as malicious. Dyn Inc. said its server infrastructure was hit by distributed denial-of-service attacks, which work by overwhelming targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attack had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites from across America and Europe, including Twitter, Netflix and Sony's PlayStation Network. ___ Japan overwork deaths among young show lessons unlearned TOKYO (AP) — Despite efforts over the past two decades to cut back on overwork, "karoshi" or death from overwork, still causes hundreds of deaths and illnesses every year in Japan. It affects all sorts of workers, from elite salaried employees to technicians and manual labourers. In Japan's corporate world, company interests tend to come first and employees are ill-placed to resist pressure to take on too much work. The Labor Standards Law sets a 40-hour workweek but a loophole for voluntary ceilings on overtime makes the law toothless, experts say. ___ US stocks close mostly lower; eke out gain for the week The major U.S. stock indexes closed mostly lower Friday, capping a day spent wavering between small gains and losses. Phone companies were the biggest drag on the market following reports that AT&T was considering a deal to acquire the media conglomerate Time Warner. Health care and energy stocks also took some losses, while consumer staples and technology companies held on to slight gains. Investors continued to focus on corporate America, reviewing earnings from General Electric, McDonald's and other big companies. Earnings from banks and other financial companies have been mostly better than anticipated, which has helped boost that sector. ___ McDonald's sales rise 1.3 per cent at US stores NEW YORK (AP) — The launch of all-day breakfast helped McDonald's record higher sales at established U.S. locations for a fifth straight quarter, but the boost from that is shrinking and the company is hoping new menu items and recipe tweaks will keep customers coming back. McDonald's said sales rose 1.3 per cent at established U.S. locations in the third quarter, matching what Wall Street analysts expected. That's down from the 1.8 per cent rise the world's biggest burger chain reported in the previous quarter. Worldwide, sales grew 3.5 per cent at established locations, far exceeding the 1.3 per cent growth analysts were expecting, according to FactSet. ___ Let's toast: Jim Beam strike ends with promise to expand LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Jim Beam ended a nearly weeklong strike at two bourbon distilleries in Kentucky on Friday, toasting a labour settlement that answers the workers' key demand with a commitment to hire more full-time staff. Union members picketing since last Saturday approved the company's latest contract offer on a 204-19 vote and will resume producing whiskey Monday, said United Food and Commercial Workers union official Tommy Ballard. ___ Canada walks out as EU trade talks founder BRUSSELS (AP) — Canada walked out of talks Friday meant to save a massive trade deal with the European Union, unable to break a deadlock with a small Belgian region that has been defying multinational efforts to have the pact signed next week. Canadian International Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland said it had been impossible to overcome the differences with Wallonia, a French-speaking region of barely 3.5 million people. Despite the stunning setback, European officials refused to accept that the pact, which had been agreed on provisionally two years ago, could not be saved. The impasse, however, raises troubling questions about the 28-nation EU's ability to negotiate major international agreements. ___ NY enacts restrictions on Airbnb, with fines of up to $7,500 ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New York state enacted one of the nation's toughest restrictions on Airbnb on Friday with a new law authorizing fines of up to $7,500 for many short-term rentals. The measure signed into law by Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo applies to rentals of fewer than 30 days when the owner or tenant is not present. Supporters of the measure say many property owners use sites like Airbnb to offer residential apartments as short-term rentals to visitors, hurting existing hotels while taking residential units off the already expensive housing market in New York City. ___ Bombardier to cut 7,500 jobs globally over the next 2 years MONTREAL (AP) — Bombardier will cut 7,500 jobs around the world over the next two years as it tries to turn around its business. The airplane and train maker said Friday that the reductions are part of a plan to restore it to profitability by 2020. Its plans to eliminate 7,500 positions — more than 10 per cent of its global workforce — through the end of 2018, are on top of 7,000 positions Bombardier already planned to eliminate by the end of 2017. ___ Wal-Mart invests $50M in China's online grocery business NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart is investing $50 million in New Dada, China's largest online grocery and logistics company, as it moves to strengthen its foothold in the nation's fiercely competitive food market. The move, announced late Thursday, is an extension of Wal-Mart's pact with JD.com, China's no. 2 e-commerce site. New Dada, partly owned by JD.com, has more than 25 million registered customers and delivers to more than 300 cities. China is a key growth market for Wal-Mart. ___ Tesla may enter ride ride-hailing business next year DETROIT (AP) — Electric car maker Tesla Motors has plans to get into the ride-hailing and sharing businesses. The company hinted at the venture earlier this week when it announced that all of its cars would come equipped with hardware needed to drive themselves. The company says in a disclaimer that use of self-driving Teslas to make money with ride-hailing or sharing will be allowed only on Tesla's own network. Details will be released next year. A Tesla spokeswoman wouldn't comment on the matter. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16.64 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 18,145.71. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slipped 0.18 points, or 0.01 per cent, to 2,141.16. The Nasdaq composite index gained 15.57 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 5,257.40. In other U.S. energy futures trading, wholesale gasoline added 4 cents to $1.53 a gallon, while heating oil gained a penny to $1.57 a gallon. Natural gas lost 15 cents, or 4.7 per cent, to $2.99 per 1,000 cubic feet. This content appears as provided to The Globe by the originating wire service.

Its plans to eliminate 7,500 positions — more than 10 percent of its global workforce — through the end of 2018, are on top of 7,000 positions Bombardier already planned to eliminate by the end of 2017. ___ Wal-Mart invests $50M in China's online grocery business NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart is investing $50 million in New Dada, China's largest online grocery and logistics company, as it moves to strengthen its foothold in the nation's fiercely competitive food market. The move, announced late Thursday, is an extension of Wal-Mart's pact with JD.com, China's no. 2 e-commerce site. New Dada, partly owned by JD.com, has more than 25 million registered customers and delivers to more than 300 cities. China is a key growth market for Wal-Mart. ___ Tesla may enter ride ride-hailing business next year DETROIT (AP) — Electric car maker Tesla Motors has plans to get into the ride-hailing and sharing businesses. The company hinted at the venture earlier this week when it announced that all of its cars would come equipped with hardware needed to drive themselves. The company says in a disclaimer that use of self-driving Teslas to make money with ride-hailing or sharing will be allowed only on Tesla's own network. Details will be released next year. A Tesla spokeswoman wouldn't comment on the matter. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16.64 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,145.71. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slipped 0.18 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,141.16. The Nasdaq composite index gained 15.57 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,257.40.

The takeover would create the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company and combine BAT’s presence in developing countries, where anti-smoking campaigns are not as strong as in the U.S. and Europe, with Reynolds’ almost exclusive focus on the U.S. ___ US internet repeatedly disrupted by cyberattacks on key firm LONDON (AP) — Cyberattacks on a key internet firm repeatedly disrupted the availability of popular websites across the United States Friday, according to analysts and company officials. The White House described the disruption as malicious. Dyn Inc. said its server infrastructure was hit by distributed denial-of-service attacks, which work by overwhelming targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attack had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites from across America and Europe, including Twitter, Netflix and Sony’s PlayStation Network. ___ Japan overwork deaths among young show lessons unlearned TOKYO (AP) — Despite efforts over the past two decades to cut back on overwork, “karoshi” or death from overwork, still causes hundreds of deaths and illnesses every year in Japan. It affects all sorts of workers, from elite salaried employees to technicians and manual labourers. In Japan’s corporate world, company interests tend to come first and employees are ill-placed to resist pressure to take on too much work. The Labor Standards Law sets a 40-hour workweek but a loophole for voluntary ceilings on overtime makes the law toothless, experts say. ___ US stocks close mostly lower; eke out gain for the week The major U.S. stock indexes closed mostly lower Friday, capping a day spent wavering between small gains and losses. Phone companies were the biggest drag on the market following reports that AT&T was considering a deal to acquire the media conglomerate Time Warner. Health care and energy stocks also took some losses, while consumer staples and technology companies held on to slight gains. Investors continued to focus on corporate America, reviewing earnings from General Electric, McDonald’s and other big companies. Earnings from banks and other financial companies have been mostly better than anticipated, which has helped boost that sector. ___ McDonald’s sales rise 1.3 per cent at US stores NEW YORK (AP) — The launch of all-day breakfast helped McDonald’s record higher sales at established U.S. locations for a fifth straight quarter, but the boost from that is shrinking and the company is hoping new menu items and recipe tweaks will keep customers coming back. McDonald’s said sales rose 1.3 per cent at established U.S. locations in the third quarter, matching what Wall Street analysts expected. That’s down from the 1.8 per cent rise the world’s biggest burger chain reported in the previous quarter. Worldwide, sales grew 3.5 per cent at established locations, far exceeding the 1.3 per cent growth analysts were expecting, according to FactSet. ___ Let’s toast: Jim Beam strike ends with promise to expand LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Jim Beam ended a nearly weeklong strike at two bourbon distilleries in Kentucky on Friday, toasting a labour settlement that answers the workers’ key demand with a commitment to hire more full-time staff. Union members picketing since last Saturday approved the company’s latest contract offer on a 204-19 vote and will resume producing whiskey Monday, said United Food and Commercial Workers union official Tommy Ballard. ___ Canada walks out as EU trade talks founder BRUSSELS (AP) — Canada walked out of talks Friday meant to save a massive trade deal with the European Union, unable to break a deadlock with a small Belgian region that has been defying multinational efforts to have the pact signed next week. Canadian International Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland said it had been impossible to overcome the differences with Wallonia, a French-speaking region of barely 3.5 million people. Despite the stunning setback, European officials refused to accept that the pact, which had been agreed on provisionally two years ago, could not be saved. The impasse, however, raises troubling questions about the 28-nation EU’s ability to negotiate major international agreements. ___ NY enacts restrictions on Airbnb, with fines of up to $7,500 ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New York state enacted one of the nation’s toughest restrictions on Airbnb on Friday with a new law authorizing fines of up to $7,500 for many short-term rentals. The measure signed into law by Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo applies to rentals of fewer than 30 days when the owner or tenant is not present. Supporters of the measure say many property owners use sites like Airbnb to offer residential apartments as short-term rentals to visitors, hurting existing hotels while taking residential units off the already expensive housing market in New York City. ___ Bombardier to cut 7,500 jobs globally over the next 2 years MONTREAL (AP) — Bombardier will cut 7,500 jobs around the world over the next two years as it tries to turn around its business. The airplane and train maker said Friday that the reductions are part of a plan to restore it to profitability by 2020. Its plans to eliminate 7,500 positions — more than 10 per cent of its global workforce — through the end of 2018, are on top of 7,000 positions Bombardier already planned to eliminate by the end of 2017. ___ Wal-Mart invests $50M in China’s online grocery business NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart is investing $50 million in New Dada, China’s largest online grocery and logistics company, as it moves to strengthen its foothold in the nation’s fiercely competitive food market.

Zipprian Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email BRADENTON, Fla. -- Deputies say a Bradenton mother and her boyfriend waited hours before seeking medical help for her 10-month-old who was burned while left alone in a hot shower. The Manatee County Sheriff’s Office tells news outlets 24-year-old Cayla Zarvas and 24-year-old Dennis E. Zipprian are facing child neglect with great bodily harm charges. An affidavit says the baby suffered second-degree burns to his groin and buttocks after Zipprian left him unattended in the shower for about five minutes while Zarvas was working at Pizza Hut. Authorities say Zipprian took the child to Zarvas’ job. The couple drove home and to Walmart, where they allegedly left the child in the car for 20 minutes while they shopped for burn cream, popcorn and cereal. The child was admitted to a burn unit the following morning, where he stayed for three days.  Doctors believe there will be permanent scarring and discoloration from the burns, reports CBS affiliate WTSP. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) This Thursday, Oct. 6, 2016, photo shows Barbie Fashionistas, from Mattel, on display at the annual TTPM Holiday Showcase, in New York. Toy companies are offering products that are more inclusive, from Barbie dolls in all shapes, sizes and skin tones to baby dolls aimed at boys. Toy companies are also offering dolls that represent different disabilities. But still experts and parents say more work needs to be done. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (4) NEW YORK • Toy companies are working harder to think outside their usual box, offering more-inclusive items like dolls with disabilities, female superhero figures and characters with a range of skin tones. Many of the products breaking down the barriers started with smaller businesses, but big names like Mattel and Hasbro are getting into the game and offering lots more options this holiday season. What that means on the shelves is Barbies that have a greater variety of body types, eye colors and facial structures, a Lego mini-figure of a boy who uses a wheelchair, and an American Girl doll with accessories like a diabetes kit and arm crutches in addition to the hearing aids and service dogs it has offered before. Other items include coding toys, robots and circuit builder sets aimed at both girls and boys. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Jennifer Weitzman, whose 5-year-old daughter Hannah has cochlear implants, has the American Girl doll with hearing aids and a Tinker Bell doll with a cochlear implant that Weitzman bought from a British site called ToyLikeMe.org. "She lit up when she was given them. She thinks it's awesome that they have implants just like her," said Weitzman, of Mount Kisco, New York. "For many kids, it helps them identify and makes them feel included." The trend started a few years ago, pushed by parents who didn't see enough diversity in the toy aisle and were turning to the internet or startups to find items. Increasingly, the inclusiveness in the toy aisle means dolls with disabilities. Toys R Us has carried an exclusive line since 2013 called Journey Girls, which includes a wheelchair and a crutch set. Its partnership with American Girl to carry the Truly Me collection starting this month will include dolls that also use crutches, diabetes kits and wheelchairs. While Lego has had larger figures before that use wheelchairs, the mini-figure introduced this year comes as part of the "Fun in the Park" set, mixed in with several figures that don't. "The designers were thinking about what might you see in the park in the city," said Lego spokesman Michael McNally. Lego mini-figures had been yellow so that children could imagine their own identity for the characters. "We've always been about helping kids find themselves," McNally said. But in 2004, it introduced flesh tones when representing real-life personalities. Experts say it's critical for children to play with toys that don't perpetuate stereotypes about what's considered beautiful. They say the toys children play with have lasting impressions on their careers and their confidence. "There's been some good progress, but there is a lot of work that needs to be done," said Elizabeth Sweet, a sociologist and lecturer at California State University in Sacramento, California. "Kids need to see themselves in the toys and objects they interact with." For building toys, the company GoldieBlox, founded in 2012, was among the first to disrupt the pink aisle by offering construction sets aimed at girls. But it also realized it needed more racial diversity, and last fall introduced a black character called Ruby Rails and has since then added a Latina engineer called Valentina and other characters. Many experts have been closely watching the moves made by Mattel, particularly with its iconic Barbie, whose business has been rebounding amid a makeover after seeing its sales suffer. The nation's largest toy maker launched the Barbie Fashionista collection last year that offered more skin tones, eye colors and facial structures. This year, it added three body types — curvy, petite and tall. It said those items have been doing well. Spokeswoman Michelle Chidoni says the company is also looking to add different body shapes to the Barbie career line and the Fairytale doll collection. Racial diversity can also be key. American Girl, which is owned by Mattel, launched a doll this year whose story is that she is growing up in civil rights-era Detroit. Wal-Mart's My Life As doll collection has expanded the number of skin shades available, and Hasbro is adding more skin tones to its Baby Alive doll for next year. Beyond introducing dolls and games that feature all kinds of characters, companies are starting to think differently about toys that have traditionally been aimed at boys or girls. The White House held a conference on gender stereotypes in media and the toys, drawing executives from major toy companies. Target Corp. phased out gender-based signage in the toy aisle last year. It also was for a time the exclusive seller of Mattel's DC Super Hero Girls, including Wonder Woman and Batgirl, which were the first 6-inch action figures designed for girls. They join other female characters in the action figure aisle that include Black Widow and Star Wars heroine Rey, says Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of TTPM, an online toy review site. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is selling its first 18-inch boy doll this holiday season under the My Life As brand, and Hasbro plans to launch a boy doll under the Baby Alive brand next year. John Frascotti, president of Hasbro Brands, cited My Little Pony, which originally was aimed at girls, and Nerf, which was traditionally for boys. Hasbro found the brands attract both boys and girls, so three years ago, it launched Nerf Rebelle that was styled for girls. As for My Little Pony, it's expanding into comic books, usually more a domain for boys. "We are focusing on storytelling and worrying less about gender," he said.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY 4 photos VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Police: Multiple stabbings at Mountain View High School, suspect in custody LDS Church 'retires' Mormon apostle's 'little factory' pamphlet Audit: Utah athletics can improve financial, hiring and inventory practices Critics cringe at Trump strategist Bannon's ties to alt-right, rhetoric targeting Mormons Rolly: Utah girl shunned by some in Mormon ward.

We are here providing food, shelter, relief supplies and other support to help thousands of people whose lives have been upended by this storm,” said Brad Kieserman, Red Cross vice president, Disaster Operations and Logistics. “We’re in the middle of a vast response, and our work is far from over. The Red Cross will be here as long as people need our help.” MAKE A DONATION The massive Red Cross relief effort in response to Hurricane Matthew in the U.S. could cost between $24 – $28 million as volunteers continue to help in the weeks ahead while residents recover from the devastation – yet, the Red Cross has raised only $8.1 million in designated donations and pledges for the response to Matthew thus far. The Red Cross depends on donations to provide immediate relief. Help people affected by Hurricane Matthew by visiting redcross.org, calling 1-800-RED CROSS, or texting the word MATTHEW to 90999 to make a $10 donation. Donations enable the Red Cross to prepare for, respond to and help people recover from this disaster. The Red Cross depends on donations to provide immediate relief. Help people affected by Hurricane Matthew by visiting redcross.org, calling 1-800-RED CROSS, or texting the word MATTHEW to 90999 to make a $10 donation. Donations enable the Red Cross to prepare for, respond to and help people recover from this disaster. RED CROSS RESPONSE Preliminary reports indicate more than 12,000 homes across four states have been affected. The Red Cross has deployed more than three-fourths of its emergency vehicle fleet, along with 5,500 disaster workers to provide relief. Working alongside dozens of partners, this help includes: Opened 378 Red Cross and community shelters with more than 97,000 overnight stays in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Today, nearly 1,000 people remain in shelters in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina. Served more than 1.1 million meals and snacks with the help of Southern Baptist Disaster Relief, and deployed 25 mobile kitchens. Distributed more than 238,000 relief items, including hygiene and cleaning supplies. Provided almost 23,000 health services, such as replacing lost medications and eyeglasses and emotional support contacts. ROLL UP A SLEEVE TO REPLENISH THE BLOOD SUPPLY Hurricane Matthew has had far-reaching impacts in the Southeast, forcing the cancellation of approximately 110 blood drives resulting in nearly 3,500 uncollected blood and platelet donations. Right now, there is an emergency need for platelet donations in many areas of the country. Platelets are a key clotting component of blood often needed by cancer patients that must be transfused within five days of donation. Eligible blood and platelet donors are urged to make an appointment as soon as possible to help replenish the blood supply for patients in need. Appointments can be made by using the Red Cross Blood Donor App, visiting redcrossblood.org or calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767). HELPING IN HAITI The American Red Cross, with a permanent team in Haiti of almost 200 staff, continues to work with local and international partners to deliver critical relief to aid many of the 175,000 residents displaced by Hurricane Matthew. American Red Cross and Haitian Red Cross teams have been distributing items including cholera-kits, hygiene kits and kitchen (cooking) kits, water purification products, shelter items and mosquito nets to meet people’s urgent needs. Cholera is an increasing threat due to damaged water systems and the lack of potable water; thus the provision of cholera kits —which contain items like soap, water purification tablets and oral rehydration salts – are an effort to help stem this threat. The American Red Cross is also supporting the Haitian Red Cross in coordinating between local authorities and other humanitarian organizations, and is working directly with the United States government to help distribute relief supplies. In addition, the American Red Cross has also brought in and set up generators and telecommunications equipment to support communications capabilities and deployed 11 disaster response specialists to lend their humanitarian relief expertise in areas such as emergency distribution and telecommunications support. In Haiti, the American Red Cross currently estimates spending more than $4 million to help the country recover. To date, the American Red Cross has received approximately $400,000 in donations and pledges specifically for the Caribbean, including Haiti. In addition, the American Red Cross will utilize some funds raised for the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, which were allocated specifically for contingencies and unexpected events such as disasters, as well as funds from grants and other donations designated for international causes.

(AP) — A chemical spill at a northeast Kansas distilling plant released a noxious cloud of fumes Friday, forcing temporary evacuations and sending dozens of people to the hospital, including two who were in intensive care, officials said. Most of the people who went to hospitals had been released by Friday afternoon. The spill occurred at the MGP Ingredients plant in Atchison, according to Katie Horner, spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Emergency Management. She said the spill occurred as two chemicals, sulfuric acid and sodium hypochlorite, were mistakenly combined at the plant, which produces premium distilled spirits and employs about 300 people. Trey Cocking, the city manager of Atchison, Kan., addresses the media after a chemical incident occurred at the MPG Ingredients plant on Friday Oct. 21, 2016, in Atchison, Kan. The Kansas Department of Emergency Management said multiple people who suffered respiratory problems because of the noxious cloud that formed were taken to hospitals. (Dougal Brownlie/The St. Joseph News-Press via AP) When the two chemicals combine they can release chlorine gas, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Homes and schools near the plant had been evacuated early Friday, but city officials gave the all clear for residents to return before noon. Atchison has about 11,000 residents and is about 50 miles northwest of Kansas City. "The threat is really over, and it's safe to be outside," said Becky Berger, assistant city manager. She advised residents to air out homes that smell like a swimming pool. Sixty-seven people sought medical attention at the Atchison Hospital emergency room, spokeswoman T.C. Roberts said, and one person remained in stable condition in intensive care late Friday afternoon. Most had been released, but two other people were admitted to the hospital. Mosaic Life Care in nearby St. Joseph, Missouri, also treated about 18 people, including one who remained in ICU Friday afternoon, said Joey Austin, hospital spokeswoman. All the others were released. The regional EPA office said it was supporting state and local emergency crews and had sent a coordinator to the site to assess the situation. MGP didn't immediately return calls seeking comment. Chris Gitro, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said wind conditions helped the plume break up. "The one thing we had on our side was that the winds were enough to make it disperse," he said. Pinpointing the cloud's direction proved to be a guessing game while it was still in Atchison. As one school building's students sought shelter in the gymnasium, students in the other three buildings were shuttled in buses first toward a Wal-Mart before being redirected to the local airport, schools Superintendent Susan Myers said. The buses were eventually directed again to Wal-Mart, she said. "They were trying to figure out the wind, where this cloud was going. It was a very fluid situation," she said. "I would say it was very anxiety-provoking to have this kind of situation. I'm sure this was an adventuresome day for everyone." The MGP plant has also had other incidents, including a small explosion in another building in February where no injuries were reported, City Manager Trey Cocking said. The plant was also the site of a 2002 explosion and fire that damaged the plant's distillery and injured a few people. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment said that since 2006 the company has faced more than $50,000 in penalties for issues including exceeding its air pollution cap and failing to install emissions devices. The company is currently in full compliance, according to the department. Trey Cocking, the city manager of Atchison, Kan., addresses the media outside of the CVS Pharmacy after a chemical incident occurred at the MPG Ingredients plant on Friday Oct. 21, 2016, in Atchison, Kan The Kansas Department of Emergency Management said multiple people who suffered respiratory problems because of the noxious cloud that formed were taken to hospitals. Their conditions have not been released. (Dougal Brownlie/The St. Joseph News-Press via AP) Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

 The Global Payment Landscape: Market Trends Explained Andrew Meola Oct. 21, 2016, 3:04 PM 1,071 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence Payments used to be a simple one-on-one transaction. You'd hand cash to a clerk in exchange for whatever goods you needed, and that was that. But today, the payments ecosystem has evolved into a complex global machine. This world of global payment processing now includes card networks, gateways, acquirers, processors, and more. To understand today's payment industry trends, one must fully understand the payments landscape. Below, we've provided a payment industry overview and outlined some emerging payments, and explained how payments made on one side of the world can be received on the other. Understanding the Global Payment System There are three stages to processing a card payment, but consumers only really deal with the first step. Yet beyond the initial swipe are important stages that make the process seamless for the user. To illustrate how the payments processing industry works, imagine someone makes a $100 purchase with a credit card. The first stage in the process is authorization. When the customer swipes his or her card at a payment terminal, the transaction data goes through the terminal to an acquiring bank, which then sends an authorization request to the customer's issuing bank. Barring any issues (such as lack of funds, a lost or stolen card report, etc.), the issuing bank sends an authorization code through the card network to the acquirer, which sends it back to the merchant to complete the transaction. And all of this happens in a matter of seconds. At this point, the consumer can leave with his or her purchase complete, but the merchant has not actually received any funds. All transactions for the day must be batched and cleared before that happens. The batch, or the aggregation of all the day's transactions, goes to the acquirer, which then requests payment on the merchant's behalf from the necessary card networks. These networks then send requests for funds to the appropriate issuing bank. This begins the third and final stage: funding. The issuing bank sends the funds to the acquirer through the card network, minus a small interchange fee . The card network also takes a minuscule assessment fee and transfers the funds to the acquirer, which finishes the clearing process. BII Payment Technologies Are Increasingly Global There are still some barriers to a truly global payments industry, but many previous roadblocks have been torn down thanks to the transition to digital payments. This shift has caused rapid transformations within the overall payments ecosystem. These new technologies have started to work their way into the mainstream, and each of them is helping to make the payments industry more global. For example, the legacy remittance industry has helped immigrants send funds to their families and friends in their home countries for more than 100 years, thanks to companies such as Western Union. But new digital initiatives are making this process easier than ever and making the payments world more connected. Mobile wallets such as Apple Pay and Chase Pay let shoppers simply tap their smartphones at terminals anywhere in the world to quickly and efficiently make a purchase. Peer-to-peer services such as Venmo make it easier for friends to split restaurant checks and rent, but you can also send money to someone halfway around the world with just the push of a button. Emerging Payment Trends Overview Thus far, 2016 has been a landmark year for the payments industry, thanks specifically to emerging payments technologies. Mobile wallets have flooded the market. Consider that Apple Pay was the only major mobile wallet in 2014, but now Android Pay, Samsung Pay, Chase Pay, and Walmart Pay have all debuted and are thriving in their own ways. At the same time, mobile commerce has matured as smartphone manufacturers have started to create devices with larger screens and payment companies have added one-click buy buttons in order to remove the friction of shopping on mobile phones. And alternative technologies are poised to disrupt the payments ecosystem, as connected device payments are becoming more popular. Watches, refrigerators, and more now have payments functionality, which could change consumer purchasing habits. More to Learn This is a broad overview of how the modern payments industry functions, but the details reveal a far deeper and more complex web that makes the payment process smoother for the public.

(AP Photo/ Evan Vucci) Gene Lyons So now the big crybaby says he’s losing because his opponent is crooked and the referees are blind. It’s straight out of the WWE “Wrestlemania” playbook. As I’ve said before, it’s not for nothing that Donald J. Trump was inducted into the professional wrestling Hall of Fame. It’s all there: the boasting, the strutting, the racialized taunts and the simulated mayhem naive observers sometimes mistake for real. But it’s all make-believe, and deep down nearly all WWE fans know it. I expect most Trump supporters do, too. Having failed miserably in his televised debates with Hillary Clinton — if he hadn’t been so outclassed, it’d be tempting to say he choked — Trump now claims that the entire U.S. political system is corrupt. OPINION “The election is being rigged by corrupt people pushing completely false allegations and outright lies in an effort to elect her president,” the GOP candidate whined. “We can’t let them get away with this, folks … Remember this, it’s a rigged election … It’s a rigged election … It’s a rigged election.” No, Donald, you’re just a big loser. Possibly one of the biggest losers in the history of American politics. “A third-rate con man who wilted under pressure and was finally incinerated in a fireball of his own stupidity” is how Rolling Stone’s Matt Taibbi puts it. From a purely psychological perspective, it’ll be interesting to watch how Trump copes with his seemingly inevitable defeat. Beaten by a woman, no less, which to a man with the psychological makeup of an adolescent chimpanzee — all chest-beating and ritualized threat displays — is doubly worse. Among the great apes, it’s common for a humiliated combatant to defecate in his hand and fling it at his rival. But I digress. The big question is how Trump’s impassioned supporters will respond to his dung-throwing.  “Election officials brace for fallout from Trump’s claims of a ‘rigged’ vote,” the Washington Post warns. The Boston Globe cautions that, “Warnings of conspiracy stoke anger among Trump faithful.” Globe reporters definitely found a few real humdingers among the crowd at a Trump rally in Cincinnati. There was Joe, a 39-year-old first-time voter who fears Sharia law but apparently dozed through 8th-grade civics. “This is my prediction,” Joe said. “Trump is going to win the popular vote by a landslide, and the Electoral College will elect Hillary, because of all the corruption.” Then there was Steve, a 61-year-old carpenter planning to heed Trump’s call to monitor suspect precincts. “I’ll look for … well, it’s called racial profiling. Mexicans. Syrians. People who can’t speak American,” he said. “I’m going to go right up behind them … I want to see if they are accountable. I’m not going to do anything illegal. I’m going to make them a little bit nervous.” Also Dan, a 50-year-old contractor who anticipates the worst: “If (Hillary Clinton’s) in office, I hope we can start a coup. She should be in prison or shot … We’re going to have a revolution and take them out of office if that’s what it takes. There’s going to be a lot of bloodshed. But that’s what it’s going to take. I would do whatever I can for my country.” As I say, this is your basic pro-wrestling crowd. They’re mostly there for the spectacle — blowing off steam. So my predictions are as follows: Joe won’t vote this time either. Why bother if it’s fixed? Steve’s enthusiasm for racial profiling will fade after election officials inform him that harassing voters is a federal crime. As for Dan, I’m guessing that the 50-year-old revolutionary’s zeal for a “Second Amendment solution” will vanish after the Secret Service knocks on his door. He’d probably been drinking. Multiply those three by millions. Look, we’ve been hearing semi-hysterical rhetoric from Cow State white folks for many years. If it’s not the Tea Party, it’s the End Times delusions of the “Left Behind” novels. Only last year, a substantial proportion of Texans persuaded themselves that U.S. Army maneuvers code-named “Jade Helm” constituted the opening wedge of an Obama-sponsored invasion. Empty Walmart stores would serve as barracks for foreign soldiers; hundreds of miles of secret tunnels were being dug to help ISIS fighters infiltrate. Christian patriots would be imprisoned in FEMA re-education camps. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott promised vigilance. Sen. Ted Cruz made sympathetic noises. And then? Nothing happened. So this year’s mass hallucination is Donald J. Trump. Well, it says here that none of these dread outcomes are likely to happen. In Arkansas, where I live, Trump will probably win by 20 points. Obama Derangement Syndrome has turned the state deep red. So what happens after Hillary Clinton’s declared the winner come Nov. 9? Well, the Arkansas-LSU game is in Fayetteville three days later. Don’t bother us, we’re busy. Sometimes I think the only thing in American life as predictable as Cow State paranoia is Blue State intellectuals taking it far too seriously.
