The Super Center is located on Grand Avenue and some residents fear the big chain will destroy the small business community. “I believe small businesses are going to feel a hit. Because they have everything and sometimes they offer it at a lower price,” said a Yazoo Resident. “We feel regardless of what comes to Yazoo City, they are longtime customers of long time businesses of Yazoo.  Competition is good. It makes businesses provide better services and goods,” said Yazoo resident Zelle Delaware. Walmart’s store manager Michael Lofton said the goal of the store is to enhance not take away from the town. “Let me tell you, 250 jobs in a small town then it actually helps for other businesses to want to come into town. According to economic development here, there are businesses now that they're all looking forward to coming to Yazoo City since Walmart has come to town.  We actually like to work together with small businesses to see how we can fit the community,” said Lofton. Yazoo’s more than a decade Mayor, Diane Delaware, says the city has been working to attract a big box store. “In Yazoo City, this is the first new business we have gotten in for a very long time, so it offers opportunities for jobs, people don’t have to drive up and down the road, and clearly it is a breath of new economic development and we are very happy about that,” added Mayor Delaware. Thelma Brown couldn't agree more. She wants to see all the businesses, especially Walmart, have success in her city. “Walmart is the best thing that ever happened to Yazoo since the invention of the indoor toilet.” Copyright 2017 MSNewsNow.

Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 70.44 -0.14 -0.20% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 853.42 +0.45 +0.05% According to Jezebel fashion blog, Jet.com on Thursday will ink a deal with Modcloth, an eclectic women's fashion brand known for serving curvy customers. Jezebel obtained a recording of Modcloth CEO Matthew Kaness telling employees about the deal, which will be announced publicly on Friday, the publication said. A spokesman for Wal-Mart, Jet's parent, declined to comment on the story. A representative for Modcloth did not respond to CNBC's request for comment. Yet if a deal for the were to go through, it would be the latest in a spate of purchases by Wal-Mart. In a bid to close the gap with Amazon (AMZN), the world's largest retailer began its buying spree with the $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet last year. Shortly after, Jet purchased Shoebuy for $70 million. And last month, Wal-Mart snapped up outdoor apparel retailer Moosejaw for $51 million. "Assortment is driving a lot of these acquisitions," CEO Doug McMillon said at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Consumer & Retail Technology Conference Tuesday. "We can pick up some of these companies that are great in terms of the assortment and the service they provide, but they don't have enough money to lose, to go market their brand and scale it." McMillon's comments were made in relation to the company's recent acquisitions and included no mention of a potential deal with Modcloth. Wal-Mart's acquisition strategy opens it up to a new set of shoppers. Jet's typical customer, for example, is younger, more urban and more affluent than a traditional Wal-Mart shopper. The plan appears to be working. Wal-Mart's domestic online sales increased 29 percent during the holiday quarter. Founded in 2002, Modcloth sells its own merchandise and products from hundreds of independent designers. The company had previously raised nearly $79 million in seven rounds of funding, according to Crunchbase.

By John Kimelman Biography March 15, 2017 7:35 p.m. ET Getty Images Amazon has what might be called a high-class problem. The company is frighteningly good at its core business, which is selling goods of all kinds online – even groceries now -- to consumers who are happy to forfeit a trip to a store. As a result, the company generated $136 billion in revenue last year and now reportedly has a 43% share of all online retail sales in 2016, according to Slice Intelligence.

But Amazon’s hypersuccess has led to a common belief that the company’s better mousetrap – a great technological interface, reliable fulfillment, and customer service that puts most others to shame -- is almost single-handily destroying the brick-and-mortar retail industry. And that perception has drawn a certain amount of unwanted attention. During the president’s campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump argued that the company had an “antitrust problem,” though Trump’s criticism was also tied into his personal animus for CEO Jeff Bezos, whose Washington Post was quite tough on him during the election. More From Barron’s The Future of ETFs Ball Corp.: A Can-Do Can Maker What Fund Flows Really Say About the Market Since Trump was elected president, Amazon has taken steps to deal with its high-class problem. In January the company announced that it would hire more than 100,000 people in the U.S. in the next 18 months. And Trump has lightened up on his criticism of Amazon and other large tech companies – at least for now. But that hasn’t stopped press accounts that tend to view Amazon’s gains as coming at the expense of brick-and-mortar retailing ranging from electronics to food. For example, a recent piece on the Cheat Sheet Website profiles four traditional retailers – Macy’s, Best Buy, Office Depot, ODP -1.0615711252653928% Office Depot Inc. U.S.: Nasdaq USD4.66 -0.05 -1.0615711252653928% /Date(1489698000230-0500)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 4376518 AFTER HOURS USD4.66 % Volume (Delayed 15m) : 200395 P/E Ratio 6.753623188405797 Market Cap 2424806853.74531 Dividend Yield 2.1459227467811157% Rev. per Employee 290026 More quote details and news » ODP in Your Value Your Change Short position and grocery chains -- “that are getting destroyed by Amazon.” The piece, for example, writes that Amazon “is set to unseat Macy’s as the biggest seller of clothing in the U.S., which is bad news for the struggling department store. Sales are down at the mall chain and the retailer plans to shutter stores across the country.” Perhaps most remarkable in Amazon’s emerging role in groceries, a business that might have seem like a bridge too far for the online retailer just a few years ago. “Amazon may only control 1% of the grocery business in the U.S., but it’s poised to take a much bigger piece of the pie, threatening both small and large supermarket chains in the process,” writes Cheat Sheet. “Amazon is already the number one online grocery retailer in the country, Investor’s Business Daily reported, and it’s starting to expand its Amazon Fresh offering to more cities. The company’s offered grocery delivery for years, but it seems newly committed to making the service work, even though it presents logistical challenges. If enough people get on board with buying their canned goods, fresh produce, and meat online, it could spell big trouble for traditional supermarkets.” But some publications seem troubled by this characterization of Amazon as a company that is laying waste to entire industries. Tech publication Wired, for example, has run at least two articles recently that amount to full-throated defenses of the company. In January, Wired ran a piece that argued that Amazon has done nothing to deserve the label, monopoly. “So far, experts say Amazon’s dominance is just that: a company outdoing the competition in capitalism’s grand tradition,” the article adds. “But it may be on the verge of becoming the kind of monopoly that Trump’s top techie, Peter Thiel, says all companies should strive to be: ’the kind of company that is so good at what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute.’ ” A more recent Wired article goes deeper in its defense of Amazon’s practices, arguing that it’s wrong to view the success of online retailers like Amazon and brick-and-mortar retailers as mutually exclusive. In fact, Amazon is partly a platform to help small retailers who now have access to more customers through Amazon’s online platform. Also, Amazon’s success, while killing certain traditional retail jobs, is also creating new types of employment tied to Amazon’s complex logistical system. “If e-commerce platforms continue to appeal to buyers and sellers, this may mean fewer traditional retail jobs —or it could simply mean a shift in the types of activities performed by people in retail occupations,” says the piece, written by Geoffrey A. Manne, executive director of the International Center for Law & Economics, and Jennifer MacLean, director of operations at ICLE. “It might also mean more jobs in manufacturing, transportation, advertising, coding, and logistics, to name a few. And while online distribution and automation may present certain challenges to traditional retailers, they also create significant opportunities. In fact, almost half of retail sales on Amazon’s platform are from third-party merchants who have chosen to sell their wares online instead of (or often, in addition to) through brick-and-mortar stores.” The piece adds that “while many are quick to disparage Amazon’s effect on local communities, these arguments fail to recognize that by reducing the costs associated with physical distance between sellers and consumers, e-commerce enables even the smallest merchant on Main Street, and the entrepreneur in her garage, to compete in the global marketplace.” Of course, it’s always troubling when the authors of a piece admit that their organization is receiving financial support from the company they are writing about, in this case Amazon. One wonders how differently the article might have been if Amazon wasn’t a benefactor. Still, if Amazon follows through on its commitment to hire 100,000 workers over the next 18 months, it will go a long to mitigating the criticism.

The start-up was founded by Marc Lore and the pair had worked together in London at Credit Suisse before Lore set up Diapers.com, later renamed Quidsi. It’s hardly the stuff of high tech yet it would prove to be a lucrative move for Hanrahan, who is originally from Co Wexford. Lore sold Quidsi to Amazon for $545 million and Hanrahan took a couple of years out of the workplace after his family expanded from two children to four, with the birth of twins. “We had four kids under the age of five and no real support network. My parents came over as much as they could, but that was three times a year. We needed it,” he says. “I was lucky to be in a situation where I could do that. We said there was no point leaving the money in a will, why not spend the money now. I’m glad I did it.” While living off savings may be nerve-wracking for some, Hanrahan always had a back-up plan. “The technology sector was booming. I was lucky in that I was never going to be short of a job,” he says. “Worst-case scenario , I had worked in banking and finance in London for a long time, and they were clamouring for people like that in New York.” It wasn’t needed. When he returned to work, it was to a new start-up, ecommerce firm Jet.com. The company had one aim – to reinvent ecommerce with a new model that would see the prices of items drop as consumers shop. The businessman found himself in the headlines last year when Walmart paid more than $3 billion for the company he cofounded with Marc Lore and Nate Faust. ADVERTISEMENT Getting started Hanrahan is currently chief technology officer for Jet.com, which was founded in 2014. He doesn’t say how much the Walmart deal netted him personally, but he has no plans to retire just yet. There’s a lot more to do, he says, and Jet is just getting started. It’s a role he has relished from the start, with about 14 months to get the technology ready before its launch. “We knew it was going to be a big splash, coming out of the gate all guns blazing. There was a lot late nights, a lot of weekends getting the technology ready, load testing and seeing how we would scale it,” he says. “It was a lot of fun. As an engineer, as a CTO, it was a dream job. I was being given the remit to run a multibillion-dollar marketplace, starting with a completely clean slate, and you’re being told that it needs to scale massively on day one. To build the technology to match those requirements was a real blast.” Among the tools Jet.com used was the public cloud – specifically Microsoft’s Azure. Luckily, it all went smoothly on launch day, despite some unexpected events. “Marc got himself on to Good Morning America on the day of the launch, which wasn’t factored into our estimates for traffic and we ended up with a 8x spike over our best estimates while he was on air,” he says. “Everything held up beautifully. We were nervous though.” It wasn’t long before the company came to the attention of Walmart – which Hanrahan says was surreal – and the rest, as they say, is history. Company culture Despite becoming part of the behemoth that is Walmart – it also owns Asda in the UK – Hanrahan says that not a lot has changed at Jet.com since the acquisition. Not in the company’s culture anyway; it’s inevitable that being part of a larger entity would bring some benefits to the business, and Walmart certainly has that end covered. Before the acquisition, Jet.com was estimating it would be profitable by 2020. While Hanrahan isn’t talking about the current estimates – Walmart is a publicly listed company so he is conscious of talking out of turn – he says the scale of the company makes things a little easier. “As part of Walmart you get access to better cost of goods from suppliers, so margins are inevitably going to improve,” he says. “In terms of the goals we set ourselves in terms of customers and gross merchandise value sales, we were – and are – flying.” Ecommerce in the US is a funny game. While Irish shoppers are used to having access to online grocery deliveries from the local supermarket, the size and geographical footprint of the US makes that a little more difficult. Then there’s the Amazon factor to deal with. “If you want to play in the ecommerce space in the US, you have to have a value proposition that is up there with Amazon,” explains Hanrahan. “That costs a lot of money. Amazon has scale, so they get huge leverage out of everything they do, in terms of technology and fixed overheads. You have to hit that level of scale to eat really.” The financials aside though, you would expect Walmart to impact the culture of Jet. But the brand operates as a standalone entity within the group, and it has been left largely untouched, despite initial fears the acquisition would see a gradual melding of the two brands and workforces. On own terms “One of the big assets for Jet was the culture, the technology, the people. They’re being very careful not to disrupt that or be seen to Walmart-ise Jet in any way, shape or form,” says Hanrahan. “They [Walmart chief executive Doug McMillan and Marc Lore] have been very deliberate and careful in making sure they don’t upset the apple cart at Jet. Obviously there was apprehension and nervousness when the deal was going on, about whether we would be inundated with Walmart people, was there going to be this bureaucracy etc, and it really hasn’t played out like that at all. The remit is that we can do that on our terms.” ADVERTISEMENT Between warehouse staff, call centre and support, Jet.com employs about 2,000 people, growing from 15 in 2015, and has 8,000 suppliers, its own distribution centres and 22 million stock items. It even has a small staff in Ireland who work on the technical side of things – about 20 people currently, but the company is always hiring, and had a presence at the recent career Zoo event in Dublin to prove it. But before you get visions of another low-cost alternative to Amazon or the regular grocery firms in Ireland, Jet.com is solely focused on the US and Hanrahan says there are no plans to change that. Time zone Having development staff in another time zone makes sense, he says. It means things can be tested at a time when it’s unlikely customers will be trying to make purchases in large numbers, and if something goes drastically wrong, it can be rolled back before most of the customer base wakes up – usually that means testing it at 4am. The company is in recruitment mode for Dublin. “It’s going to be an engineering centre for us,” says Hanrahan. “The initial impetus for the idea was because all our engineers were in Hoboken [New Jersey] they were basically getting woken up a lot at night. they were starting to experience burnout. “On the flip side, we didn’t want to have just an operations ‘keep the lights on’ centre. We wanted to extend the working day.” Then there was the chance to expand its hiring pool away from the competitive New York environment. Dublin was a natural choice for the company, Hanrahan says. “It’s been hugely successful for us,” he says. “When we meet great people, we want to hire them. We’re going to roughly double the technology team at Jet over the coming year; the mix of Dublin and Hoboken. We’ll see how that plays out.”       Read More This week we’re talking about . . .

(REUTERS/Jon Nazca) Share Written by Zameena Mejia Obsession Fashion March 15, 2017 For more than a decade, women’s fashion retailer ModCloth has provided cool, quirky clothing in a wide range of sizes. The apparel startup’s fun, inclusive approach has helped it build a loyal following of female shoppers. That loyalty may soon be put to the test. On Wednesday (March 15), Jezebel reported that the indie e-tailer is being acquired by Jet.com, an Amazon competitor that was itself purchased by Walmart last summer. Jet is investing in fashion at a moment when Amazon—already the top online clothing store for millennials—is positioning itself to become the largest apparel retailer in the US. In January, Jet acquired ShoeBuy.com, a rival to Amazon subsidiary Zappos. With ModCloth, Jet is targeting a younger audience. According to a report from e-commerce data firm Slice Intelligence, more than half of ModCloth’s customers are millennials, an age cohort that also accounted for the largest share of online apparel sales in 2016. The deal may also be a needed one for ModCloth. While the retailer’s sales were soaring as recently as 2013—and a big expansion planned even more recently—employees told Jezebel that ModCloth has faced six rounds of layoffs in the past two and a half years. In a meeting with employees on Wednesday, CEO Matthew Kaness characterized the Walmart acquisition as an opportunity for the company to grow. But fans of the indie retailer were less enthused. Although Walmart and Jet have remained separate brands, ModCloth loyalists were already worrying on Wednesday that the company will lose its independent spark. Femmes of the world, unite in mourning. @ModCloth has been bought out by Walmart. FUCK. https://t.co/NNZJ9kZrU1 — ArielTroster (@ArielTroster) March 15, 2017 I've been a frequent @ModCloth customer for so long, but with this Walmart merger I think I may be done. So gross 😒🤦🏻‍♀️ — Jessica Semler (@Jessi_said_what) March 15, 2017 https://t.co/DMxZGRdN5P I am going to miss #modcloth because now it is part of my Walmart boycott. Bye modcloth. :( It hurts. — Christiebelle (@Christiebelle) March 15, 2017 It looks like someone started an alternative places to shop if you like modcloth comment thread on the piece itself: https://t.co/Ov2vWabEwK — Preeti Chhibber (@runwithskizzers) March 15, 2017 As noted by Jezebel, organizational differences between ModCloth and Walmart could also be problematic. The former has been praised for making fashion accessible for women of all sizes, the latter criticized for its tone-deaf approach to sizing. ModCloth founder Susan Gregg Koger wrote a blog post about the company’s support of the International Women’s Day strike and gender equality; Walmart has been sued for gender discrimination and accused of worker abuse and insufficient pay. At an even more basic level, ModCloth is an online operation (despite a few brick-and-mortar locations), a space where Walmart is still playing catch-up. Quartz has reached out to ModCloth, Jet, and Walmart for comment and will update with any responses.

Tech Apple Science Cars Geneva Motor Show Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     NES Classic In Stock Sporadic At Amazon Prime Now Posted: Mar 15 2017, 3:11pm CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News   NES Classic Shopping Guide   Shoppers still find NES at Prime Now. The Nintendo Switch launched last week and is now as hard to find as the Nintendo NES Classic. Now Nintendo has two consoles that are in high demand and short supply. Don't Miss: Win a FREE Nintendo Switch in our Giveaway As no major NES shipment has arrived, reseller prices stay up. The NES Classic offers on the reseller market on Amazon.com on Wednesday, March 15 starting at $160 plus $3.99. Many offers are in the $160 to $170 region now. These reseller prices are no about has high as they have been at the peak in the past Holiday season. We have been able to secure a NES Classic and a Switch to give away to our readers in March. Enter now to win a new Nintendo Switch and a Nintendo NES Classic in our two exclusive I4U News Giveaways. The NES Classic supply has not improved with the launch of the Switch. The last time the NES was on sale online for the regular retail price of $59.99 was on March 10 at Best Buy's online shop. The only option that has worked in past days is Amazon Prime Now. The local delivery service of Amazon has offered the NES in select cities. The most recent cities the NES was available has been Richmond, earlier today. We have seen the NES also in stock in New York, San Francisco, Dallas and New York in past days.  Supply is extremely constraint. Amazon only allows one NES Classic order per person. There is strict limit on how many NES an account can order for a set period of time, which is now days. Ordering a NES via Amazon Prime Now is great, but its a hassle to spot one in stock and ready for order. It arrives in 2 hours for free in the cities where Amazon Prime Now is available. NES hunters have to refresh the search for the NES Classic for their ZIP code on a regular basis to spot the NES in stock. Some NES hunters, who are not living in a Prime Now area, are starting having the NES ordered at Amazon Prime Now to UPS stores. It seems to work, but not always and it is a hassle. Follow the discussion here. There is also no pattern where the NES Classic will be available next on Amazon Prime Now. Target and Walmart stores have not shown significant inventory in the past days. Consumers scored NES classic consoles through Amazon Prime Now and Amazon Spain. NES Classic Stock Updates NES Classic at Amazon.com The NES Classic reseller prices keep on rising. The NES Classic offers on the reseller market on Amazon.com on Monday, March 12 starting at $160 plus $3.99. Many offers are in the $160 to $170 region now. Amazon Prime Now has shown the NES Classic available in select cities for very short period of times throughout Wednesday. On Thursday at 1:25am ET, we spotted the NES Classic in stock for Las Vegas on Amazon Prime Now. NES hunters also are keeping an eye on Amazon.es as NES supply in the United States has dried up. Cost of ordering a European version of the NES on Amazon Spain is reasonable. NES Classic at Target The NES Classic at Target stores availability is still very low with 1% according to BrickSeek on Monday, March 13. The chances to find a NES at a Target store are low. NES Classic at Walmart The NES Classic at Walmart stores stock indicator drops to 2% according to BrickSeek on Monday, March 13. The chances to find a NES at a Walmart store are low. NES Classic at GameStop The NES Classic was last in stock at GameStop online on Feb. 9. GameStop only offered the NES Classic as part of bundles starting at $79.99. Inventory lasted about 9 minutes. NES Classic at Best Buy The Nintendo NES Classic was on sale online at bestbuy.com on Friday, March 10. Overall the $59.99 NES inventory lasted about 12 minutes. This means that the consumer electronics giant only received a small shipment. NES Classic at ToysRUs Stores No new updates. NES not in stock at ToysRUs stores and online shop. TRU is only selling NES accessories online. BrickSeek has relaunched. The inventory searches for Target and Walmart are still available. To check the NES stock situation at a nearby Walmart use this page on brickseek and for NES stock at Target stores use this page. Zoolert is now also offering a service to check inventory of retail locations. Zoolert supports besides Target and Walmart also ToysRUs, GameStop and Best Buy. Looking to buy a new Nintendo Switch console? Check out the latest in stock updates for the Nintendo Switch online. GameStop is offering a Switch bundle with April delivery online. The ability to mod the NES Classic and install an unlimited number of games has renewed the hype around the retro console. The latest version of hakchi2 allows NES owners to install over 800 NES games. A new hack even allows NES owners to run SNES games via an emulator.  It is easier to find NES Classic controllers Amazon now, although they are not from Nintendo. Here is a list of popular NES accessories on sale on Amazon. NES Classic Edition Accessories Nyko MiniBoss Controller for NES Classic Edition Pernos 2Pack 10ft 3M Extension Cable for Nintendo NES Classic Mini Edition Controller Ortz 10ft Controller for NES Classic Mini [TURBO EDITION] Buttons 8Bitdo NES30 Classic Edition Wireless Controller Set with Bluetooth Retro Receiver 10ft Extend Link Extension Cable For Nintendo Mini NES Classic Edition RDS Industries NES Classic Edition Carrying Case Nintendo Classic Mini: Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Controller Nintendo is under criticism for bad demand forecasting since years. Part of it is intentional as shortage generates buzz. The downside are the countless hours of people spent in line and the caused frustration. There is no update from Nintendo when the Japanese video game maker will resolve the shortage. The $59.99 Nintendo NES Classic Edition console launched on November 11 in stores and online. The supply was extremely constraint in stores and especially online. The palm-sized NES console, retailing for $59.99 list price, features the classic Nintendo NES controller many geeks have grown up with. The retro console comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES games including Super Mario Bros., Pac-Man, Metroid, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby's Adventures. The NES Classic Edition system is a miniaturized version of the groundbreaking NES, originally released in 1985. The Holiday shopping season 2016 has been dominated by the hunt for Hatchimals and the Nintendo NES classic edition. The NES Classic demand is still strong amidst ongoing shortage. In about one months the new Nintendo Switch will go sale and Nintendo fans brace for the worst. The Nintendo Switch pre-order are sold out. The supply situation might no be as bad as for the NES, but it will be difficult to get a Switch at launch for customers who have not pre-ordered the Switch. Find out how to get the Nintendo Shift on March 3.  Win a new Nintendo Switch and a Nintendo NES Classic in two exclusive I4U News Giveaways.

Report: Beloved Indie Clothing Retailer ModCloth To Become Part Of…Walmart? Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Report: Beloved Indie Clothing Retailer ModCloth To Become Part Of…Walmart? March 15, 2017 3:53 pm EDT By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup acquisitions jet jet.com modcloth surprising acquisitions walmart Many startups dream of being acquired by a deep-pocketed benefactor, but sometimes the brand reputations of the startup and of the new parent company don’t quite match up. For example, what does the quirky online retailer ModCloth have in common with Walmart? According to news reports, what they have in common is that Walmart subsidiary Jet has purchased ModCloth. ModCloth fills a specific niche of whimsical and vintage-inspired fashion and accessories, and is also notable for its diverse selection of models. The site encourages customers to post photos of themselves in items as part of their reviews to give shoppers an idea of how an item might fit their body type. The site is generally inclusive of women who wear over a size 12 in a way that most fashion retailers are not, in that it actually sells items over size 12. Its customers tend to be young, progressive, and feminist. Employees tipped off Jezebel, providing a recording of the all-hands meeting where ModCloth CEO Matthew Kaness shared the news. Reporter Anna Merlan describes the reaction as “an immediate, audible rustle of dismay” on the recording. Employees knew who Jet’s parent company is. Modcloth hasn’t shared the news with the public yet; Jezebel reports that employees received offer letters from Jet/Walmart this morning, the deal will close tomorrow, and the company planned to announce the acquisition on Friday. A ModCloth employee told Jezebel’s Merlan that they will receive their first paychecks cut by Walmart this Friday. “I ask that we keep this within the company, as we usually do,” Kaness reportedly says on the recording. We know about this possible deal two days in advance, which tells you how loyal employees may be to their new employer. He praised Jet, telling employees, “I think there’s a lot of overlap culturally with what they’re about and what we’re about. I think over time this is going to become an incredible marriage.” While the CEO might be excited about the deal, the reaction among ModCloth fans has been swift and negative. Walmart, after all, is known for punishing employees for anything that resembles union activity, low wages that have risen a bit lately, and the relentless pursuit of lower prices. This doesn’t do much for Modcloth’s sunny feminist indie cred. .@ModCloth is being sold to https://t.co/AHycenqKef / #Walmart so I will no longer be shopping with them. pic.twitter.com/eqLBC2AzZx — Megan Figueroa (@megandfigueroa) March 15, 2017 @ModCloth I don't do business with Wal-Mart, so it looks like I'll never buy another thing from you again. #jet #walmart — Alexis K.

I’ve boycotted Walmart for years, no problem, but boycotting Modcloth hurts 😔 https://t.co/biGUdckUsZ — sharks (@amillionsharks) March 15, 2017 Walmart acquired Jet, which was losing money at the time, last August for more than $3 billion with the hope of bolstering its e-commerce operations. Since then, Jet has acquired ShoeBuy in turn, and co-founder and CEO Marc Lore said that the company was on the prowl for more e-commerce acquisitions. What Jet is after, Lore explained to Recode, are “categories where they are long-tail, high-margin products and harder-to-crack brands.” That does sound like the niche vintage-inspired fashion offerings of ModCoth. Consumerist has contacted ModCloth, Jet, and Walmart about this report, and will update this post when we hear back.

According to Jezebel fashion blog, Jet.com on Thursday will ink a deal with Modcloth, an eclectic women's fashion brand known for serving curvy customers. Jezebel obtained a recording of Modcloth CEO Matthew Kaness telling employees about the deal, which will be announced publicly on Friday, the publication said. A spokesman for Wal-Mart, Jet's parent, declined to comment on the story. A representative for Modcloth did not respond to CNBC's request for comment. Yet if a deal for the were to go through, it would be the latest in a spate of purchases by Wal-Mart. In a bid to close the gap with Amazon, the world's largest retailer began its buying spree with the $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet last year. Shortly after, Jet purchased Shoebuy for $70 million. And last month, Wal-Mart snapped up outdoor apparel retailer Moosejaw for $51 million. "Assortment is driving a lot of these acquisitions," CEO Doug McMillon said at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Consumer & Retail Technology Conference Tuesday. "We can pick up some of these companies that are great in terms of the assortment and the service they provide, but they don't have enough money to lose, to go market their brand and scale it." McMillon's comments were made in relation to the company's recent acquisitions and included no mention of a potential deal with Modcloth. Wal-Mart's acquisition strategy opens it up to a new set of shoppers. Jet's typical customer, for example, is younger, more urban and more affluent than a traditional Wal-Mart shopper. The plan appears to be working. Wal-Mart's domestic online sales increased 29 percent during the holiday quarter. Founded in 2002, Modcloth sells its own merchandise and products from hundreds of independent designers. The company had previously raised nearly $79 million in seven rounds of funding, according to Crunchbase. Krystina GustafsonEditor Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change WMT ---

The news was revealed to ModCloth employees in an all-hands meeting, a recording of which was given Jezebel. The source told Jezebel the news would be announced officially Friday, a day after it closes, Jezebel said. Jet.com, an e-commerce startup, recently acquired e-tailer companies like Shoebuy.com and Hayneedle. Jet.com itself was acquired by Walmart last August. ModCloth and Jet.com have not yet commented on the news. Read: Walmart Free Two-Day Shipping On The Way After It Nixes Its Amazon Prime Rival, ShippingPass “This is news that hasn’t been shared by the public yet,” ModCloth CEO Matthew Kaness told employees in the recording obtained by Jezebel. “I ask that we keep this within the company, as we usually do.” ModCloth, which was founded in 2002 by Eric Koger and Susan Gregg Koger, quickly became known for its vintage-style apparel, including dresses, footwear and swimwear. The e-commerce site also became a hub for its versatile styles and range of cuts and silhouettes for women of all sizes. The company even partnered with denim brand Wrangler to launch its Wrangler x ModCloth collection Monday. The seven-piece collection debuted in ModCloth’s full-size range, which runs from XS through 4X. Jet.com was purchased by Walmart in August 2016, for about $3.3 billion, in addition to $300 million in shares. The acquisition was spurred by Walmart’s push to expand its e-commerce growth. “We’re looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience because that’s what our customers want,” Doug McMillon, Walmart Stores Inc.’s president and CEO, said in a statement announcing the Jet.com purchase. “Walmart.com will grow faster, the seamless shopping experience we’re pursuing will happen quicker, and we’ll enable the Jet brand to be even more successful in a shorter period of time.”  Related Stories US Companies Could Suffer Under Trump Tariffs Walmart Gets Rid of Amazon Prime Rival ShippingPass, Offers Two-Day Shipping Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

Modcloth employees have been told that Friday's paychecks will come from Walmart, Jezebel reports. The deal is set to close tomorrow. A formal, public announcement is planned for Friday. Walmart's acquisition of Modcloth may seem like a strange pairing to many, given the fashion retailer's progressive, feminist message. Meanwhile, Walmart has faced frequent criticism for its poor labor policies and allegations of gender discrimination.

Modcloth also recently launched its "Style for All" campaign, showcasing women of different ages, ethnicities, sizes, and professional backgrounds. Last month, the retailer also called out the haters (and misogynists) behind a sexist billboard by sponsoring a contest for a replacement to take its place. Walmart, however, has faced criticism for racist packaging practices, discriminating against pregnant employees, and paying wages that do not allow a full-time employee to earn a living wage. The Arkansas-based company was also sued for gender discrimination in its employment practices back in 2011 in a case that reached the Supreme Court. The case involved a Walmart employee who learned $10,000 less annually than a male employee with the same job title and experience. The woman was told that the male employee needed the higher wages since he had a family to support. Modcloth fans and customers have already taken to Twitter to express their views of the acquisition; several have shown disappointment in Modcloth, a company that many of its customers believed shared their progressive values. https://twitter.com/denamlandon/status/842053827205464064 https://twitter.com/magicshelle/status/842045877074157568 https://twitter.com/jordankkush/status/842068448956030976 https://twitter.com/Oh_Kelly_O/status/842067697672302600 https://twitter.com/tiboribi/status/842064923836461064 https://twitter.com/gifcompatible/status/842064481979142145 https://twitter.com/YAdultescent/status/842064321131757568 https://twitter.com/sinkLindsaysink/status/842063514177044481 We have reached out to Modcloth for comment.

Close Close Modal Window Email This Story Send email to this address Enter Your Name Add a comment here Verification Send Email Cancel It was only nine o’clock in the morning. After a stressful drive to work during which she was nearly collided into by assumingly drunken drivers three times, Service Desk Associate Kari Geldernick found herself explaining to a customer that Walmart had sold out of its entire beer stock. An agitated customer stood a few feet back in line wondering how long it would take to get out of the store, all while a staff shortened by 25 people due to call-ins struggled to keep the superstore running not-so-smoothly. That’s when a regular truck packed with a shipment of food products arrived—whether by chance or by careful planning on the part of Walmart’s management team—to save the day. “It was pure luck,” Geldernick said. Geldernick, a senior at the  University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, said that working at Walmart on April 16, 2016, “was terrible.” She added, “it was one of the worst days I’ve ever worked.” “The whole day was very stressful,” Geldernick said. “We just had to move on, because it wasn’t going to get any easier.” Geldernick arrived to work before 8 a.m. to a mob of people waiting for the store to open its doors. Within minutes, she became aware that 15 cashiers and service workers had called in to report that they were ill and could not work their shifts that day. Another ten workers from other departments also had called the store to report that they would not be coming to work that day. In addition, extra workers were not able to relocate from either Fort Atkinson or Janesville to help out for only one day, as that is against company policy, Geldernick said. Many customers had to wait in lines that could take more than 20 minutes to get through. “It hurt their shopping experience,” Geldernick said. “They waited in line too long, got angry with the company and threatened to never come back.” For the next couple weeks following Spring Splash weekend, Walmart’s business took a hit. Geldernick said some customers had been afraid to leave their homes due to the number of drunken drivers on the roads. She added that she hopes students and community members will be very careful this year to avoid car accidents due to drunk driving. An unnamed Walmart employee requested off in advance, in hopes of attending Spring Splash with friends. The request off was denied, and the employee decided to call-in to report they would not be coming to work. “It was a beautiful day out,” the employee said. “It was the one weekend I was absolutely sure I wanted off work.” Many college students, especially seniors, enjoy attending Spring Splash with friends. “They might not be able to do anything like this for a while,” the employee said. “After graduation, people get jobs, they get married, they have kids. College students need a weekend to hang out.” Geldernick said it is very likely there will be a similar situation at work during this year’s Spring Splash. She hopes the store will be overstocked and overstaffed in order to minimize depletion of product and to compensate for a likely “high number of people calling off work.” “I’m thinking of ways to try to get people to at least come in,” Geldernick said. “Maybe persuade them that they can work their shift and then go out afterwards. But if they don’t want to come in, they don’t want to come in. I can’t force them to [work].” Tags: article series, Brad Allen, kari geldernick, Royal Purple, Splash of Cash, student news, WalMart Leave a Comment The Royal Purple encourages readers to voice their opinions via the online comments section.

The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. Credit: Miller Lite Miller Lite has cracked open a new tagline -- "Hold True" -- but will continue its product-focused approach that includes extreme close-ups of the brew, while attacking its larger competitor, Bud Light. The new ads by 180LA began trickling out this week and were previewed at MillerCoors' annual wholesalers meeting in Las Vegas. A spokesman described the effort as an expansion of the "Spelled Different, Because it's Brewed Different" campaign that launched last year. That campaign began taking on Bud Light in September, and the new effort continues that approach. One of the new spots shows a Miller Lite can set on top of a Bud Light coaster, while a voiceover plugs Lite as brewed with "more taste, less calories and half the carbs." Beer Business Daily, which reported on the private wholesalers meeting, stated that the "Hold True" message is meant to convey multiple meanings, including "holding to the authentic original light beer, with minimalist graphics on its packaging." Lite eked out a 0.1% gain in shipments last year as its beer market share held steady at 6.2%, according to data from Beer Marketer's Insights. Bud Light -- the nation's top brew -- saw its market share fall from 17% to 16.2% as shipments fell by 4%. The new tagline comes 17 years after Budweiser used a one-word tagline, "True," that debuted with the iconic "Whassup" ads. Those ads were based on a short film called "True" by Charles Stone III that featured friends and their unique greeting. Leinenkugel's Anniversary Lager Bottle Credit: Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company In other MillerCoors news, the brewer is celebrating the 150th anniversary of its Leinenkugel's brand with a limited-edition "anniversary lager" brewed in collaboration with Munich-based Hofbräu München. The brew, set to arrive at select bars in April and in six-packs in June, is made with American hops and some German malt. E-commerce sales of packaged goods continued to soar last year, according to data provider 1010data, up 36% to $10.4 billion based on data from the top 100 online retailers. E-commerce accounted for $2.8 billion of CPG growth, enough to account for around 0.4 percentage points of overall growth for an industry whose sales grew only 1.7% to $681 billion last year, according to IRI and Boston Consulting Group. The 1010data report excludes direct sellers that fall outside the top 100 e-tailers, such as those shaking up the razor business -- Unilever's Dollar Shave Club and Harry's. So the actual CPG e-commerce total is higher. Non-food categories dominate, with health supplements alone accounting for $2.6 billion in sales. Pet food comes in second at $1.5 billion. It was the fastest-growing segment -- up 67% and bigger than the people-food categories of drinks and snacks combined, which had under $1 billion in sales. Various beauty and personal-care categories combined for more than $3.6 billion. Top selling online brands include Optimum Nutrition, Blue Buffalo and Procter & Gamble Co.'s Pampers. Jet.com, launched in 2015 and acquired last year by Walmart, was the fastest growing CPG e-commerce retailer, up nearly fivefold. Walmart.com was up 42% year over year, edging the 40% growth for Amazon's non-subscription business. But Amazon's subscription CPG sales soared 80%. According to 1010data, which said Jet's volume-based discounts may be helping Walmart counter Amazon's subscription edge. McDonald's App Credit: McDonald's Onto the fast-food biz, where some McDonald's customers out west are getting an early chance to use the marketer's mobile order and pay technology in its app. The so-called "beta pilot" covers Monterey and Salinas, Calif., and Spokane, Wash. The early access is available for 29 California locations and will extend to 51 restaurants in the Spokane area starting March 20. The plan is to get feedback before rolling the system out nationally at the end of 2017. And how does the Golden Arches plan to eliminate soggy fries or other concerns when food sits around after it is ordered? It is using geofencing technology for check-in: food won't be prepared until customers are nearby. Speaking of McDonald's app, an annual study from Market Force Information showed the world's largest restaurant chain had the highest awareness of its mobile app in the burger category. However, it came in last place in the category overall, with In-N-Out ranked as the favorite burger chain. Chipotle took the top spot in the Mexican category after Taco Bueno snagged the lead last year during Chipotle's food-safety woes. Chick-fil-A kept its top spot in chicken and Firehouse Subs moved into first place in sandwiches after landing in second in 2016. Growing Ohio-based chain Marco's led in pizza for the first time. Burger restaurants are still the leading category surveyed, with 45% saying they visited a burger chain at least five times in the past 90 days. Market Force's findings from an online survey of more than 11,000 adults (about 73% female, 27% male) found tech matters in quick serve: 55% said they used an app or tablet at a table to order over the past 90 days. Nearly one-third (31%) said they recently used an app or digital wallet to pay, up from 23% in 2016 and 19% in 2015. "We are seeing strong year-over-year trends indicating that the adoption of consumer technology in the QSR industry is increasing dramatically," Cheryl Flink, chief strategy officer for Market Force Information said in a statement. "Recent announcements of QSRs rolling out more kiosks, apps and delivery services should accelerate that adoption even further and have a huge impact on the future of dining out." Esi Eggleston Bracey is leaving as president of Coty's consumer business at the end of March for personal reasons, the company announced, to be replaced by Laurent Kleitman, currently exec VP-global hair care for Unilever. He takes over May 15, and like Ms. Bracey will report directly to CEO Camillo Pane. Ms. Bracey, a career Procter & Gamble Co. executive, formerly headed P&G's cosmetics business before it was spun off to Coty last year. She accepted the Coty role in November 2015, and it's been a rough ride. Sales for the consumer business fell 13% last quarter, which Mr. Pane on an earnings call termed "clearly disappointing" and blamed in part on some of the key brands being "orphaned" at P&G. Grey, with which Ms. Bracey worked many years at P&G, said it resigned all its Coty business last month, also including Clairol and fragrances, citing "financial differences." A Coty spokeswoman later said CoverGirl, the biggest spender among the brands Grey exited, moved to Droga5 "based on creative merit," not financials. In an email, Ms. Bracey said she's planning to take some time off for a personal sabbatical to spend with her family in Geneva before they relocate to New York in the fall. "I was doing split family between New York and Geneva and decided that the distance was no longer manageable," she said. Procter & Gamble Co. faces an uphill battle in its call for all digital media providers to get verification of viewability from third parties accredited by the Media Rating Council, given that only one of the major social media "walled gardens" so far have formally started the audit process. But the one that has -- Google's YouTube with a viewability audit being handled by Ernst & Young -- is confident it will meet P&G's year-end deadline, a spokeswoman said. Google has received 30 MRC accreditations across other parts of the business over the years, she said. Speaking of the MRC, it could use some more participation from marketers. Speaking at the Association of National Advertisers Media Conference earlier this month, MRC CEO George Ivie noted that while the group has plenty of participation from media companies and agencies, it could use more from marketers. Lastly, well-known and oft-quoted ad legal expert Linda Goldstein has changed firms. Ms. Goldstein, formerly the chair of the advertising, marketing and media practice at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, has joined BakerHostetler, where she will lead the firm's work in advertising, marketing and digital media space.

The congressional internship program is a wonderful example of an initiative for African-American students that works,” said Kimberly Woodard, Walmart’s director of federal government relations and CBCF board member, in a statement. “The program’s success over the last six years has raised the bar for congressional internships and we commend the CBCF for its commitment to promoting diversity on the Hill.” According to information provided by the CBCF, Walmart has provided $2 million to support the program since 2006. Traci L. Hughes, Communications Director for the CBCF, told Politic365 in a phone interview that Walmart’s monetary support was “invaluable.” “More than 80 of our students have benefited from the internship program and clearly the training and exposure they have received served them well,” said Hughes. “Many of them have gone on to work on Capitol Hill. They’re currently earning law degrees, MBAs, and have even started their own companies.” The internship program spans a semester and CBCF says the program “… prepares participating students for careers in public service or the private sector.  As a result of Walmart’s funding, interns also receive a stipend and housing during their internships.” According to the CBCF, Walmart’s funding will also help sponsor its Semester in Washington internship program, a project formed through a partnership with the George Washington University. Former CBCF intern and Hampton University graduate Darien E. Nolin — now a financial analyst for a federal agency and MBA candidate at the Johns Hopkins University — spoke to Politic365 about the value of the CBCF’s internship programs. Nolin said that his CBCF internship afforded him an opportunity to develop more professional relationships with other interns and those working in Congress as he benefited from “… the amount of exposure that it brought and the amount of confidence it gave [him] to pursue other things.” And it appears that Nolin is among CBCF intern alums making remarkable educational and professional strides. “When you look at today’s economy and see what our former interns are doing and where they are working, it affirms the quality and reputation of our program as the best training ground for college students interested in public and civic service,” said Muriel Cooper, CBCF Senior Media Manager, in an email to Politic365. CBCF provided the following list of the CBCF’s Class of 2009 Walmart Emerging Leaders and the different educational and professional endeavors they are currently engaged in: Keith Benjamin: Legislative Associate for the Transport Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO and co-Chair of The Young & Powerful Group DC Chapter.

This is the second Super Walmart to open in Ames. The new store is somewhat unique, as it was built almost touching the old building. “Were able to move things through a hole in the wall from one store to the other extremely unique experience,” said Michael White, who is the Walmart Store 749 Manager. “Most of the time the stores are a block down the road or a mile down the road but to be able to do it right next each other this close is a fantastic experience.” Walmart held a grand opening ceremony which included the Walmart cheer, and they presented grants to the Ames Police Department, Fire Department, and to Ames High School. The ribbon was cut by long time Walmart Associate they all call “Miss Ruth,” a 30 year store employee, who was there when the ribbon was cut on the original Walmart store next door, in 1985. “There’s a building over there that is now vacant that has held lots of memories for lots of people for many many years,” said Todd Carr, a district manager with Walmart. “I’ve been lucky in my career to do quite a few of these and I know it’s tough I know it’s tough and we tear that thing down it’s gonna be a sad day, but when you see with this building has offer the community the associates it is well worth it.” The old store will be torn down and used for parking. The building removal, and new parking lot is expected to be completed in September. 42.052905 -93.620682 Filed in: News Topics: Ames, Iowa, Walmart Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Google Email Reddit Tumblr Popular DNR: Guilty Plea in Trophy Buck Poaching Case Gordmans to Close All Stores Across the Country Valley Students Say USA Themed Student Section Not Aimed At North’s Refugee Athletes Latest News Iowa Public Television Takes Hit Under Trump Budget Proposal Trump budget proposal would boost defense, eliminate funds for humanities, arts Eagle Grove Planning for Expected Growth in Enrollement Iowa State Cyclones Big 12 Championship Shirts a Hot Ticket News Centerville Business Gives New Life to Old Walmart News Police Chase Leads to Evacuation of Clinton County Walmart News Ames Aldi Relocates to Duff Avenue News Walmart Adding 10,000 U.S. Jobs News Names of Driver and Victims Released In Pella Walmart Crash News Pickup Truck Drives Into Pella Walmart News Ames Police Seeking Help in Thursday Night Casey’s Robbery News DCI Hopes to Finish Up Pella Walmart Crash Investigation This Week News Ames Neighborhood Works to Preserve Green Space at Former Edwards School News No Charges Filed in Deadly Pella Walmart Crash News Friends Remember Crash Victim as Pella Walmart Pharmacy Reopens News More New Development Changing Campustown in Ames News Three People Killed, Two Injured When Truck Slams Into Pella Walmart Mobile Apps 13Now News App for iPhone & iPad 13Now News App for Android 13WarnMe Weather App for iPhone & iPad 13WarnMe Weather App for Android Facebook Twitter Instagram About & Contact screenertv Screener Untitled-2Covers Online Public File • Terms of Service • Privacy Policy • 1801 Grand Ave. Des Moines, IA 50309 • Copyright © 2017, WHO • A Tribune Broadcasting Station • Powered by WordPress.com VIP × Email Alerts Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

The first occurred March 3. The county’s 911 dispatch received a call about two males allegedly shoplifting at the Walmart Supercenter in Fulton. Police responded, stopping a vehicle that matched the description of the suspects’ as it was leaving the parking lot. According to Fulton Police Chief Reggie Johnson, upon inspection of the vehicle, the officer allegedly discovered a felony amount of crystal methamphetamine. Clinterius Edison, 29, and Zach Harter, 28, both of Tupelo, were arrested and charged with possession of crystal methamphetamine. Harter also received a misdemeanor charge of shoplifting. Both have received bonds of $5,000, set by Justice Court Judge Harold Holcomb. Three days later, on March 6, Itawamba County dispatch received another report of shoplifting, again at the Fulton Walmart. Police responded and arrested Teresa Borden of Dennis for shoplifting. Upon searching her, officers allegedly discovered a felony amount of crystal methamphetamine on her person. She was charged with felony possession and misdemeanor shoplifting. Borden’s bond was also set at $5,000, again by Judge Holcomb. Officers with the North Mississippi Narcotics Unit assisted with both arrests. According to Fulton Police Chief Reggie Johnson, there’s been a recent uptick in the number of narcotics arrests in Fulton, although he adds the city’s rate of drug crimes falls in line with those of surrounding areas. “About each grand jury, just here in the city, our narcotics officer is presenting between 12-15 cases,” Johnson said. “Of those, more than half will be crystal meth.” Johnson said meth is readily available, leading to the surge. “It’s just something that’s exploded,” he said. adam.armour@journalinc.com Twitter: @admarmr Share this: Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to Press This!

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 March 2017 by Military News National Nonprofit Keep America Beautiful Joins Corporate Partners to Boost Recycling in Flint, Michigan, Schools Launching comprehensive school-based recycling program with support from The Coca-Cola Company, Nestlé Waters North America, the PepsiCo Foundation and the Walmart Foundation SOURCE: Nestlé in the U.S. DESCRIPTION: Stamford, Conn., March 15, 2017 /3BL Media/ – The Coca-Cola Company, Nestlé Waters North America, the PepsiCo Foundation and the Walmart Foundation today announced that they have partnered to fund an integrated recycling education and awareness initiative for the 10,000 school students affected by the Flint water crisis, led by national nonprofit Keep America Beautiful and its local Flint, Michigan, affiliate Keep Genesee County Beautiful (KGCB). In January 2016, the four companies announced they would provide up to 6.5 million bottles of safe and clean drinking water to Flint school students. From the outset of the program, they have been providing for the storage and delivery of the bottled water, as well as the transporting of the empty water bottles for recycling. The new initiative provides funding for a multi-tiered educational approach aimed at increasing the number of plastic bottles that are recycled within school grounds as well as create opportunities to provide students, teachers and staff with the knowledge and the passion to recycle at home, at school and on-the-go. “Keep America Beautiful is thrilled to receive broad support from a host of partners in our efforts to educate, motivate and activate Flint’s students, teachers and the broader school community to properly recycle the tremendous amount of material that is being generated,” said Brenda Pulley, senior vice president, recycling, Keep America Beautiful. “This is a great opportunity for us to work closely with Keep Genesee County Beautiful to make a meaningful difference in improving recycling throughout Flint and to teach the next generation of environmental stewards the benefits of recycling and how to recycle right.” The K-12 school-based program objectives are to: Provide outreach, tools, resources and activities to educate, motivate and activate students, staff and teachers to recycle more and recycle right; Organize, support and share resources with recycling champions at each school to support day-to-day recycling efforts; Share best practices and support school personnel responsible for collecting and consolidating recycling at each school on proper recycling bin placement, signage and collection of the recyclables; and Track and report the amount of recyclables being collected by the schools with the goal of achieving a 25 percent increase in recycling. “Promoting recycling education and infrastructure to Flint schools in partnership with Keep America Beautiful is important and something we are actively engaged in,” said Aaron Stallings, Walmart Market Manager for the North Central Division. “We see this program contributing to a more resilient and sustainable Flint.” “The Coca-Cola Company understands the importance of ongoing support for the residents of the City of Flint. Providing water for daily use was the first step and the promotion of recycling and recycling education round out this support,” said Bruce Karas, Vice President, Environment and Sustainability, The Coca-Cola Company North America. “We must all do our part to ensure that residents’ needs are met and the City of Flint returns to the viable and vibrant city we all know it can be.” “Water is a human right and as soon as the PepsiCo team learned about Flint and their drinking water supply, we reached out to be part of creating sustainable, local solutions,” said Tim Carey, Senior Director Sustainability and Recycling, PepsiCo. “We all want to be part of communities with abundant natural resources so PepsiCo is pleased to support the City of Flint and other partners to give back to Genesee County. We’re striving to collect every bottle and every can as part of this powerful partnership.” “Access to clean, safe drinking water is the right of every man, woman and child. That is why helping our neighbors in Flint is something we’ve been proud to do,” said Nelson Switzer, Chief Sustainability Officer for Nestlé Waters North America. „But our shared commitment doesn’t end there. We now need to work together so the bottles the coalition used to deliver safe drinking water are recovered and recycled. Together with our coalition partners and the families of Flint, we are very pleased to kick-start a massive recycling opportunity.” Keep America Beautiful is working in tandem with KGCB to tailor the recycling educational lesson plans, tools and activities for Flint’s students, while ongoing recycling education and program implementation is being conducted by KGCB staff and volunteers. Resources include take-home materials in an effort to bring the school education and experience home, reaching families in their residences to also enhance curbside recycling participation. “Since this crisis began, Keep Genesee County Beautiful has been the ‘go-to’ recycling resource for the Flint community. We help Flint residents cope with the water crisis by raising awareness and educating residents about the benefits of recycling, by signing up residents for curbside recycling and being a pickup point for recycling bins,” said Karen West, Program Director/Lead Consultant, KGCB. “We are incredibly grateful for this financial support and appreciate the opportunity to work with Keep America Beautiful and the students and staff of Flint schools to encourage, educate and engage the community in recycling.” Keep America Beautiful is providing materials from its Waste in Place curriculum; its “I Want To Be Recycled” public service advertising campaign; Recycle-Bowl, its national in-school K-12 recycling competition; America Recycles Day and other resources as part of the overall programming to improve the in-school recycling rate.

The unit of Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc., also known as Walmex, said it would invest 17 billion Mexican pesos ($863 million) this year, 19% more than in 2016. Around 38% of the investment will be in store remodeling and maintenance, and 31% will be in new stores, which the company expects will contribute between 2 and 2.2 percentage points of sales growth. The retailer, Mexico's largest in terms of sales, said it has earmarked 13% of the total for logistics, about 10% to further develop its e-commerce business and the remaining 8% for infrastructure to handle perishables. In December, Walmex said it expects to invest $1.3 billion in logistics, in addition to what it spends on store expansions, much of that over the next three years. Walmex reiterated its 10-year plan of doubling annual sales between 2014 and 2024. Its sales grew 12% last year to around $27 billion. At the end of February, Walmex operated 3,029 stores, including 735 in Central America.

People are gravitating towards alternatives like Amazon for one primary reason…to buy more for less. Amazon is high-volume and low-margin, and it doesn’t have the property overheads that brick-and-mortar retailers do. But life is never one-dimensional. There are other factors at play. Factors that could cost yield-starved investors serious money. The relentless pressure on retail margins has forced Warren Buffett to act. This headline, and the extract that follows, is from Fortune magazine on 16 February 2017:    Source: Fortune.com ‘Warren Buffett believes in America’s future but seems more doubtful about that of Walmart and other traditional retailers. ‘As recently as last summer, Buffett’s holdings in Walmart were worth $3 billion, and are now down to less than $100 million. The Oracle of Omaha first invested in the company in 2005. ‘Buffett himself seemed to take a dimmer view of traditional retail’s prospects at Berkshire’s annual meeting last year when he said of Amazon, “It is a big, big force and it has already disrupted plenty of people and it will disrupt more,” adding that many companies “have not figured the way to either participate in it, or to counter it.” In the face of the Amazon onslaught, Walmart shares have gone nowhere for the past decade. Buffett’s decision appears to be a concession that the trend to cannibalise retail margins is here for the long term. And with good reason. This is from Business Insider on 3 January 2017: ‘Nearly every major department store, including Macy’s, Kohl’s, Walmart, and Sears, have collectively closed hundreds of stores over the last couple years to try and stem losses from unprofitable stores and the rise of ecommerce. ‘But the closures are far from over. ‘Macy’s has already said that it’s planning to close 100 stores, or about 15% of its fleet, in 2017. Sears is shuttering at least 30 Sears and Kmart by April, and additional closures are expected to be announced soon. CVS also said this month that it’s planning to shutdown 70 locations.   ‘Mall stores like Aeropostale, which filed for bankruptcy in May, American Eagle, Chicos, Finish Line, Men’s Wearhouse, and The Children’s Place are also in the midst of multi-year plans to close stores. ‘Many more announcements like these are expected in the coming months.’ Aussie retailers are next in the firing line… The Australian, on Wednesday, 1 March 2017, ran an article titled: ‘Fears build as Amazon seeks warehouses’. Here’s an extract: ‘Outgoing Wesfarmers chief executive Richard Goyder has repeatedly warned the US retailer will “eat all our breakfasts, lunches and dinners”, and the group’s entry could cost local retailers as much as $4 billion in sales.’ The Aussie Recession Survival Guide: How to protect your wealth in a fast-shrinking economy In this urgent investor report, Daily Reckoning editor Greg Canavan shows you why Australia is poised to fall into its first ‘official’ recession in 25 years… Simply enter your email address in the box below and click ‘Claim My Free Report’.

Source: Business Insider With the likes of Sears and Macy’s closing stores, shopping centres are losing anchor tenants. Without these big-name retailers to attract foot traffic, other retailers start feeling the pinch. Recently, I was speaking with the manager of a major retail store on the Gold Coast — to protect their identity, I won’t disclose which one  — and they said that business was not good. They were hoping it was a slow month, rather than a trend. When anchor tenants identify a trend of falling sales, management’s standard response is to reduce expenses — cut staff numbers, and talk to centre management about a reduction in rent. It’s this latter response that investors in retail REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) need to be aware of. When tenants negotiate rent relief, income distributions are going to be adversely impacted. In addition to stagnating or falling rental income, there’s the role interest rates play in the income and capital equation. Here’s a couple of charts of Scentre Group (the $23 billion spin-off from Westfield) and Charter Hall Retail REIT (a $1.7 billion fund): Source: Yahoo Finance   Source: Yahoo Finance In both cases, the unit prices peaked in July/August 2016.   REIT Price July 2016 Current Price % return Scentre $5.40 $4.30 Minus 20% Charter Hall $4.90 $4.25 Minus 13%   Distribution paid:   REIT Distribution Paid As a % of July 2016 price As a % of current price Scentre 21.3 cents per unit 3.94% 4.95% Charter Hall 28.2 cents per unit 5.75% 6.63%   In the first half of 2016, investors were chasing yield due to the RBA cutting the cash rate from 2.0% to 1.5%. What did the herd do? Rushed into higher-yielding options like REITs. In July 2016, investors in Scentre bought an income stream of 3.9%. That has come with a capital cost, so far, of 20%. Not real bright… Investors in Charter Hall have fared a little better. The 5.75% income stream they bought has only cost them 13% of their capital. Whereas the 100 cents in the dollar in a term deposit is still earning 3%. Term deposits may be boring, but, from where I’m sitting, they offer the best risk versus reward equation at this stage of the cycle. When the cycle turns — and it will — our cash is going to buy investments with very low risk and high reward…a much better equation, in my book. The final word on this belongs to Warren Buffett: ‘…when you combine leverage and ignorance, you get some pretty interesting results.’ Regards  Vern Gowdie, Editor, The Gowdie Letter Urgent Investor Report: The Aussie Recession Survival Guide: how to protect your wealth in a fast-shrining economy In this urgent investor report, Daily Reckoning editor Greg Canavan shows you why Australia is poised to fall into its first ‘official’ recession in 25 years… You’ll learn: What Central Bank Rate-Slashers Don’t Want You to Know: Has the Reserve Bank’s rate-slashing obsession really helped stimulate the Australian economy?

On March 9, the Cabell County Commission in West Virginia took legal action, not against users or drug dealers, but against companies that distribution prescription painkillers. The lawsuit alleges these companies knowingly ignored the opioid epidemic, by delivering huge amounts of opioids to drug stores in Cabell County. It says the companies “sold some 40 million doses of hydrocodone and oxycodone to Cabell County pharmacies between 2007 and 2012” The county’s population is less than 100,000. The suit names AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, CVS Indiana, L.L.C., Cardinal Health, Inc., Rite-Aid of Maryland, Inc., Walmart Stores East, LP, Kroger Limited Partnerships I & II, McKesson Corporation, Walgreen Eastern Co. Inc.,and H.D. Smith Wholesale Drug Co. AmerisourceBergen response: AmerisourceBergen has been and remains committed to the safe and appropriate delivery of controlled substances. We work on a daily basis with regulatory agencies and our customers to combat drug diversion, while being mindful of the need for appropriate access to medications for patients whose doctors and care providers have prescribed them. Lawsuits modeled on legal claims that have already been settled with the State of West Virginia divert attention and resources from the collective action that’s needed from prescribers, wholesalers, pharmacists, patients, insurers, regulators and enforcement authorities to address the impact of prescription drug abuse in our communities. We plan to vigorously defend ourselves in this litigation while continuing to work collaboratively with our supply chain partners in combating drug diversion.” CVS response:   “CVS Health is committed to the highest standards of ethics and business practices, including complying with all federal and state laws governing the distribution of controlled substance prescriptions from our distribution centers, and is dedicated to reducing prescription drug abuse and diversion. We also have stringent policies, procedures and tools to ensure that our pharmacists properly exercise their corresponding responsibility to determine whether a controlled substance prescription was issued for a legitimate medical purpose before filling it. Our commitment to preventing prescription drug abuse also extends to our patient and youth education efforts, an industry-leading program to increase access to the overdose-reversal medication, naloxone, and a drug collection unit donation program to local police departments nationwide. And in West Virginia specifically, all of our pharmacies replaced single ingredient PSE products with a tamper-resistant PSE product to prevent its usage in the making of methamphetamine.” Cardinal Health response: “We believe that these copycat lawsuits do not advance any of the hard work needed to solve the opioid abuse crisis – an epidemic driven by addiction, demand and the diversion of medications for illegitimate use. Cardinal Health maintains a sophisticated anti-diversion program that includes advanced analytics, technology and the deployment of teams of investigators embedded within our supply chain. We continue to work collaboratively with all participants - regulators, physicians, manufacturers, and pharmacists - to collectively address the constantly changing tactics utilized by those determined to obtain these medications for non-medical use. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against these allegations.” RiteAid response:   “We do not comment on pending litigation.” MSNBC asked, but did not receive a response from:             Walmart             Kroger             McKesson Corp             Walgreens             HD Smith The national organization representing primary pharmaceutical manufacturers, the Healthcare Distribution Alliance: “Prescription drug abuse is a complex problem and each component of the supply chain shares the responsibility for controlling the availability of opioid pain medications. This epidemic must be addressed through a multi-faceted, collaborative approach that includes the doctors who write the prescriptions, the pharmacists who dispense the drugs, the distributors who deliver the medicines, the manufacturers who make and promote the products, and the federal and state regulators who license and regulate these entities and determine supply. “Enhanced communication and coordination between the DEA and supply chain stakeholders is critical to successfully addressing prescription drug abuse and diversion. To that end, HDA is pleased with the willingness of the current leadership at the DEA to meet with and engage registrants, and is encouraged by the agency’s desire to ‘reset the relationship’ with our industry. “The DEA’s strategy now is to work with registrants to actively clarify ambiguities in the regulations before they become a problem. The agency is laying the groundwork for an even more collaborative approach to solving the opioid abuse epidemic in exactly the way that the Government Accountability Office recommended in 2015 by developing rulemaking to further clarify the responsibilities of distributors. We look forward to engaging with the DEA as this effort unfolds.” Explore: Drugs Tuesday's Mini-Report, 3.14.17 Obtained tax documents shed new light on...

(VRX) Recent Posts: Wells Fargo & Co (WFC) Stock Is in a Gold-Plated Doghouse An Uber IPO Will Be a Down Round Dollar General Corp. (DG) Stock Is an All-Weather Buy View All Posts Dollar General Corp. (NYSE:DG), the store for people who can’t get to a Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) regularly, has gone nowhere in the three months since it last reported earnings. The fourth-quarter report, due Mar. 16, is expected to show improvement, $1.41 per share of earnings on $5.98 billion in revenue, but whether that ends the carping for DG stock remains to be seen. Source: Shutterstock Since hitting an all-time high of $96.71 per share last July, Dollar General has lost nearly 20% of its value. Its top line seemed to stall at $5.3 billion, and its performance over the last year trails low-cost retailing rivals Fred’s, Inc. (NASDAQ:FRED), Big Lots, Inc. (NYSE:BIG) and even Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR), which won a bitter takeover battle against it for Family Dollar. If the Dollar General earnings meet expectations, DG stock could gap up, just as it gapped down after the July earnings disappointed. DG Stock: A Contrary Bet Analyst views on Dollar General tend to run contrary to their views on the economy. If you think happy days are here, you may not like DG stock. If you’re worried, like Richard Band, you may like it a lot. The trend among analysts, however, has been to move Dollar General from a buy to a hold, as they think the recovery will continue. DG is a very misunderstood company. Some analysts lump it in with Dollar Tree, whose dollar stores fit well in middle-class strip malls. Others class it alongside Walmart, whose stores are too big to serve Dollar General’s niche. Simply put, DG serves poor people. Most of its outlets tend to be in the food deserts of big cities or in towns too small to use a bigger store. For many people, it’s a retailer of last resort, one reason it had a growth runway during the low, slow climb out of the last recession. Dollar General serves these customers well. The stock is customized for the location. You will find pork rinds only where there are customers who like pork rinds. Where it’s legal,the company sells tobacco, beer, wine and even hard liquor. These innovations kept sales, and DG stock, rising throughout the recovery. Dollar General averages 30% gross margins on its inventory, against 25% for Walmart and a miniscule 13% for Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST). The margins are still smaller than small merchants can live with, the stores smaller than any Walmart can profitably build, and this gives Dollar General a nice business.

Headlines from this week indicate Wal-Mart is doling out at least $320 million over the next three years to try and boost sagging sales in Brazil. Brazil has been a disappointment for Wal-Mart over the past several years as the retailer failed to win significant market share against its competitors. The deep recession felt by the Brazilian people didn’t leave consumers seeking Wal-Mart supercenters nearly as much as Carrefour and smaller grocers. In the fourth quarter comp sales for Wal-Mart Brazil were down 4%, disappointing given the strong 8.9% results recorded by Walmart stores in Mexico and Central America in the same period. Walmart International has said it plans to spend $320 million in Brazil by 2020 to upgrade store infrastructure in hopes of wooing back customers hit hard by a lingering recession. Some analysts have previously said Brazil might be a market Wal-Mart could exit given the troubles it’s experienced in growing market share. IGD analysts recently noted that Walmart International is trying to re-energize its business in Brazil with a combination of store closures and increased investments in other store remodels as it tries to create a store network that’s better equipped for long-time success. IGD said the Sam’s Club and the Maxxi (cash and carry) wholesale business have been the better performers in that market through the fourth quarter of last year. The analysts said Wal-Mart’s challenge is that it has a much smaller presence of the popular cash and carry stores than its rivals who have more marketshare than Wal-Mart. “Consolidation of its distinct Brazilian operations around core banners and operations should provide new impetus to growth and drive efficiencies in the future, but in a competitive marketplace where broader economic growth remains hard to come by, Walmart will need to work hard to drive significant growth in Brazil,” IGD analysts noted. BEAUTY BOX SUBSCRIPTIONS Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon recently told Wall Street that one of his biggest challenges was flooding the engine with too many new ideas. But he’s also been an advocate for failing fast and piloting lots of ideas that seek to win the retailer favor with consumers, such as the new two-day free delivery for online orders of $35 or more. The retail giant is also dabbling in the subscription model with its launch of the Walmart Beauty Box available through a partnership with Hello Subscriptions and IDR Marketing Partners. Consumers can sign up online for the subscription box which is delivered each quarter. The beauty box contents are curated by the partners with product samples including makeup, hair care and bath and body care items. https://beautybox.walmart.com/how-it-works/ Walmart Beauty Box for Spring began shipping last week. The cost for the sample box is free but there is a $5 fee for shipping and handling. Walmart Beauty notes on the website the primary objective is to provide consumers with the information and product samples of popular products sold in its stores and online. Once a consumer signs up the subscription box is sent at the beginning of each quarter coinciding with the seasons. The subscription can be cancelled at anytime to stop the automatic seasonal shipments. TWEAKING E-COMMERCE TALENT On the heels of  a somewhat deep corporate staff reduction, Walmart.com said this week it plans to increase hiring for its tech operations in the San Francisco Bay area. “We are in the process of hiring hundreds of merchandise and category specialists for Walmart.com,” said Ravi Jariwala, a spokesman for Walmart.com. The retailer employs about 2,300 between the San Bruno and Sunnyvale locations. Walmart eCommerce CEO Marc Lore recently announced a restructuring plan for the retailer’s online business segment which eliminated nearly 200 jobs around the Walmart.com business. But he said at the time there would be more investments made in people and technology throughout the year. “We are shifting our investments and building up teams that can launch two-day shipping and other customer-facing initiatives that further enhance the digital shopping experience,” Jariwala said. Analysts have largely supported the retailer’s efforts to invest in the online/omnichannel business. McMillon told analysts Tuesday that the supercenter fleet is running more profitably and having a true omni channel focus that marries online with stores is the retailer’s best chance to win against competitors.

Sean O'Reilly (TMFBuckeye) Mar 15, 2017 at 7:43PM It has been 12 long years since Sears Holdings (NASDAQ:SHLD) Chairman, and CEO, Eddie Lampert merged what was once the world's largest retailer with Kmart in an attempt to build a mega-retailer. The idea being that the new enterprise would be capable of competing with not just with Wal-Mart, but also the likes of Macy's and J.C. Penney. While at first hailed as a stroke of genius, the combination has been a disaster. Store traffic and total sales, which have been halved since that fateful day in the spring of 2005, have slid year after year. Today, the beleaguered retailer's shares sit just above their all time lows, having recently experienced a pop on more promises of cost cuts and that ever-elusive "turn around." Despite this pledge, losses continue to mount, and there are whispers of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the future. But Sears Holdings shareholders have cause for hope, for here to save the day and offer some free advice is an army of savvy consumers, shrewd bargain-hunters, and espousers of all that is rooted in good-old fashioned common sense. I speak not of myself but of a recent conversation I had at a small family reunion. Image source: Getty Images. In what amounted to a harmless, unscripted, and unexpected conversation about what Sears just doesn't get, multiple members of my family had some fantastic business insights for Eddie Lampert -- an obviously smart guy who was probably out of his depth when it came to operating a retailer. Here's what they had to say: Pick a brand! The value of combining what is arguably America's most storied department-store brand with a tried-and-true, but struggling, discount retailer never quite made sense to many on Wall Street. My conversation drove home the fact that Main Street feels the same way. As I explained, the rationale for the Sears-Kmart combination was largely based on both companies' extensive real estate holdings, as well as the reasonable idea that they could at least match the pricing structures of their competitors. And that's why we all agreed that focusing on a single brand was just the ticket. By putting all its attention on a single brand -- perhaps Sears, as it's arguably the more valuable brand of the two -- the company could leverage the distribution network, real estate, and negotiating power of the combined entities. Sears locations could have remained the same, while Kmart locations could have been converted to "Sears Everyday" or "Sears Home." A hitch in this plan is that of the two brands, Kmart was the stronger-performing retailer in recent years, perhaps proof that the company simply needs to pick a cohesive, value-focused strategy and stick to it: Here's what gross profit looks like:  Segment FY 2013 FY 2014 FY 2015 39 Weeks Ended Oct. 31, 2016  Sears domestic ($940 million) ($920 million) ($708 million) ($874 million) Kmart ($351 million ($422 million) ($292 million) ($387 million) Data sources: FY 2015 10-K filing -- statement of operations. Dec. 8, 2016, 10-Q filing. And the year-over-year percentage change in comparable-store sales:  Segment FY 2013  FY 2014  FY 2015  39 Weeks Ended Oct. 31 2016  Sears domestic (1.4%) (2.1%) (11.1%) (8%)  Kmart (3.6%) (1.4%) (7.3%) (4.2%) Data source: FY 2015 10-K filing -- segment results. Dec. 8, 2016, 10-Q filing. To many present, the fact that there was never a cohesive strategy when the two companies merged told them that the company was simply confused about its identity. You don't have to stay anchored to America's malls Both brands have experienced a decreasing store count, particularly since fiscal 2012, when the company's overall total store count topped out at 4,010. Now, following wave after wave of mass closures, the spinoff of Sears Canada, and asset sales, that number stood at just 1,430 as of Jan. 28, 2017. True, closing unprofitable stores has been the name of the game for retail in recent years, but the company does have more leeway with consumers when it comes to its presence as an anchor store in practically every major mall in the United States. Many at the table noted that they don't mind driving for a bargain on desirable wares. What's more, many noted that other comparable retailers, including J.C. Penney, have standalone locations that often have fantastic deals just down the street from the local mall. Sears' management team is probably aware of that fact. It is, after all, seeking to monetize as many unprofitable locations as possible through the company's Sears Holdings Real Estate subsidiary. The message to management, then, is clear: Focus on giving your customers a reason to come to your store, and less on the old rules (such as convenient locations), and you might just win back a few customers. Which brings us to the most valuable lesson for Lampert and company. Give the people what they want Throughout the conversation at my reunion, I repeatedly heard complaints about the merchandise offerings at both Kmart and Sears. Here's a sample: "One of the only reasons people had to go to Sears was for Craftsman tools; now that's been sold off." "The clothing at both these places is beyond unattractive." "I like their silver-toed socks, though." "Why can't they at least offer the same type of clothing that you find at Target?" "Oh, I love going to Kmart for winter gloves on clearance. I get $40 worth of gloves for $8." "I still can't believe they spun off Lands' End." "If I need a new outfit, I immediately go to T.J. Maxx or Dillard's." The key point for Sears Holdings to draw from this debate is to look around at what its competitors are doing, because consumers sure are. It needs to ignore the real estate deals, rewards programs, and spinoffs for a second and ask why a shopper would go to Sears or Kmart over any number of other offerings. In a world dominated by constant discounts, rewards programs, and Amazon.com, consumers simply have too many choices for you to not offer at least something of equal value.  Foolish takeaway I walked away from the evening with not only a full belly (there truly is nothing like a home-cooked meal) but also a full brain, grateful for what I'd learned. It's easy to reduce the operations of a business to just income statements and balance sheets, an endless array of ones and zeros, dollars and cents. But those numbers are the product of something, not the inputs. They're the end result of a million decisions American shoppers make every day. And they tell a tale of once-loyal Sears and Kmart shoppers choosing to go elsewhere, which is why the accounting statements continue to show a sea of red ink. Is the sainted advice of my Midwestern relatives the magic elixir that saves Sears? Maybe, maybe not. But I do feel one thing is for sure: Giving the customers value for what they want and putting yourself in their shoes is probably a step in the right direction.   Sean O'Reilly has no position in any stocks mentioned.

(KFSN) KFSN By Christina Fan Wednesday, March 15, 2017 11:58PM MERCED, Calif. (KFSN) -- From the window of a barbershop in Downtown Merced Richard Torres has watched other businesses come and go and this week, the city lost another. "I wasn't really too surprised, because I knew they tried to do a lot of things that fall through." Walmart broke the news Wednesday, canceling its plans to build a 1.2 million square foot warehouse on the Southside of Merced. The company said the retail industry has changed. "It took us a bit of a shock, we asked questions, tried to see if they could reconsider, but no," said Mike Conway, Assistant to the City Manager. Walmart first announced its plans to build the distribution center in 2005, but the city says a lawsuit filed immediately by the Merced Alliance for Responsible Growth caused the project to lose steam. "That took until 2013 to fight it all the way through the court, by that time there was the recession, their business model had started changing," said Conway. City officials said they have not been idly waiting all this time. Other projects have been in the works-- including two hotels and a new UC Merced building. "We knew there was always that off chance it might not happen or take longer than expected, we've always been moving forward," said Conway. Torres said although new construction is great a large scale distribution center is what Merced really needs. "I think they build a lot of stores and restaurants, but it's not enough for people looking for jobs." One that can permanently inject life and jobs into a city that's been waiting for more than a decade.

Mark Byrd, manager for the new Sam’s Club under construction in Springdale, has signed on with Wal-Mart’s Lifetime Learning program to learn Spanish because many store customers are likely to be Latino small business owners. It’s part of his goal to make sure the store is a reflection of the community. Byrd’s language lessons are with the Rosetta Stone software system – which is sold at SamsClub.com. He’s hired about 80 of the 200 employees (full-time and part-time) who will staff the club when it opens late spring. Most of those hired are in the area selling memberships to local residents and businesses. The Sam’s Club model is dependent on its membership base given that merchandise is sold at near cost. Though Byrd would not say how many members it takes to support a typical club, he said the local membership drive is going well. Last week one employee came in toting a $10,000 check from a local new car dealer who bought the memberships to give away to their prospective customers. Byrd co-managed the Sam’s Club in Fayetteville several years ago before taking over a club in Hot Springs for an 18-month period. He most recently spent four years as a club manager in Tulsa. “I knew if I could I get back to Northwest Arkansas that’s where I wanted to be. We love this area,” Byrd said. The new Sam’s Club will have all the bells and whistles as the Bentonville Club, including the meat island that features fresh fish, premium deli, high-end steaks and a fresh sushi bar. Byrd said the Club will have a fuel station and a Club Pickup lane. When asked how he planned to make the Springdale club unique, he said it will carry more brands that Hispanics favor. Byrd has been in contact with Scott Swenson, manager of the Walmart Supercenter on Thompson Street in Springdale, which also caters to special requests by Latino shoppers. He hopes to be the supplier for food truck owners and restaurant owners in the Springdale area. He said the club pickup option with a more convenient location should resonate with small business owners in Springdale. Mark Byrd, manager, Sam’s Club in Springdale While the club will offer ethnic foods and consumables, he said it will also cater to families with the same type of products found in the other two clubs in the area. One area where the Springdale Club plans to help local eateries and product suppliers is giving them priority for in-club demos. He hopes local companies looking to get their products in Sam’s Club will seek out the Springdale Club first. Byrd said he will put them in touch with a team at the corporate office to work out the details. He said he’s also eager to work with the Northwest Arkansas Naturals on various partnerships during the baseball season given they are geographic neighbors. With two other clubs in Northwest Arkansas, Byrd isn’t concerned about market saturation or cannibalization of the other clubs’ sales or the local Walmart U.S. stores. “Sam’s doesn’t open clubs unless the corporate office is confident it will be supported by local members. We hope to draw members from the Siloam Springs area and Eastern, Oklahoma, in addition to Springdale and elsewhere,” Byrd said. He said hiring will ramp up in the next few weeks and these employees will be training in the other clubs as well as stocking merchandise as they prepare to open before June, weather permitting. Sam’s Club will give away $25,000 in local grants to nonprofits who apply. Byrd said there will be a meeting on the requirements at 10:30 a.m., March 22 at the Hiring and Membership Center setup at 1110 Mathias Drive in Springdale, across from the construction site. He said the meeting will include brunch, and nonprofits interested in grant money should attend. Byrd said the local club employees decide how the money is divided, giving them some ownership in the process. The Sam’s Club Community Grant Program awards grants ranging from $250 to $2,500. Eligible nonprofit organizations must operate on the local level – or be an affiliate/chapter of a larger organization that operates locally – and directly benefit the service area of the facility from which they are requesting funding. Interested applicants can apply online at www.foundation.walmart.com. With the opening date approaching, Byrd said he’s eager to get employees hired and trained. He said many of the new hires are local to the Springdale community and there are some transfers from other clubs blended into the mix. He said having a blend of experiences and cultures is a reflection of the community the club will serve. The last time Springdale had a Sam’s Club was 2006 when parent Wal-Mart Stores failed to secure a liquor license. A new club with a liquor store was built in North Fayetteville in 2006. A second club was added in North Bentonville in 2008. The population of Northwest Arkansas is estimated at roughly 530,000 residents and is expected to grow to 670,000 by 2025, according to the Northwest Arkansas Council. Since 2000, the regional population has grown from 330,000, according to U.S.Census records. Springdale Mayor Doug Sprouse said it’s hard to estimate the financial impact of the new Sam’s Club given the landscape of Springdale has dramatically changed since 2006. But he said it will be another great anchor for the development to come near the Arvest Ballpark, Arkansas Children’s Northwest and NorthWest Arkansas Community College which has also planned to build just west of Interstate 49.

The database belongs to Dun & Bradstreet which licenses information on businesses and corporations for use in credit decisions, business-to-business marketing, and supply chain management. In 2013, they held over 225 million business records from companies around the globe. The leak of the 52.2 Gigabyte corporate database from the business services firm contains millions of people’s names, work email addresses, phone numbers, and the companies they work for, along with their job titles, ZDNet reports. Huge Data Hack - 35M+ hacked from @DnBUS US database https://t.co/Zy5KknVqtu#CyberSecurity@cvpayne@FoxBusinesspic.twitter.com/KZ7zGavDwH— KeelsUS (@KeelsUS) March 15, 2017 Dun & Bradstreet said it owned the database, which it had acquired as part of deal in 2015 to buy NetProspex. An internal investigation showed the firm had not suffered a security breach, meaning the leak could have come from one of its thousands of customers. The leak affects over 100,000 employees with the Department of Defense, over 88,000 with the US Postal Service, more than 6,000 with AT&T, over 55,000 with Wal-Mart, more than 40,000 with CVS, over 38,000 with the Ohio State University, over 35,000 with Citigroup, more than 34,000 with Wells Fargo Bank, over 34,000 with Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, and over 33,000 with IBM. DETAILS: #Yahoo announced breach in Sept 2016, that it was working w/ authorities, believed attack state-sponsored. https://t.co/Fo0kzjsMsXpic.twitter.com/xoL7xf6Ij8— RT America (@RT_America) March 15, 2017 The breakdown was entirely US-focused, with California as the most highly represented demographic with over four million records, then New York with 2.7 million records, and Texas with 2.6 million records. Dun & Bradstreet downplayed the risk to its customers and told ZDNet that the company contains “generally publicly-available business contact data, used for sales and marketing purposes.” Breach analysts, however, see the massive hack differently. “Whilst you could piece together parts of the data from information already in the public domain, having it aggregated and so easily searchable in this fashion is enormously valuable,” Troy Hunt said in his blog. Hunt runs a breach notification site Have I Been Pwned, who obtained the database and analyzed the records. “It also serves as reminder that we’ve lost control of our privacy; the vast majority of people in the data set would have no idea their information is being sold in this fashion and they certainly don’t have control over it.” #Vault7: Key revelations from @WikiLeaks’ release of #CIA#hacking tools https://t.co/bnSx8C2Rgapic.twitter.com/knFQ7aEGOm— RT America (@RT_America) March 11, 2017 It is not known yet, how the data was exposed, and who is to blame for the leak. The hacked database was used by marketers wanting to direct target their own email campaigns and through other communications methods for current and prospective customers.

Dakota Senate Rejects Blue Law Repeal Because Citizens Should “Use That Time To Go To Worship” March 15, 2017 by Hemant Mehta Leave a Comment Of all the states that still have “blue laws” in the books — preventing the sale of certain items like liquor on Sunday mornings — North Dakota’s may be the strictest in the nation. Until 1991, virtually no retailers (like Walmart) were allowed to be open on Sunday. After 1991, businesses open to the public could only be open after noon (with few exceptions). Why? Because Sunday morning is reserved for Jesus, dammit. And we can’t have any distractions like open stores that might lure people away from church. That ridiculous, archaic thinking is what North Dakota legislators were trying to overturn with HB 1163. At the end of January, the bill scraped through the House by a vote of 48-46. But yesterday, the State Senate shot it down on a 25-22 vote for reasons that make as much sense as the law itself. “Man was not made for the Sabbath, rather the Sabbath was made for man,” Senator Robert Eberle (R-Lehr) told the floor in remarks attributed to Jesus. He went on to call the desire for Sunday sales “selfish consumerism.” Senator David Clemens (R-West Fargo) said North Dakotans should “use that time to go to worship” or be with their families. Senator Diane Larson (R-Bismarck) echoed those sentiments. The obvious rebuttal here is that religious people are free to abide by the Sabbath or attend church or be with their families. No one’s stopping them. Just because other options are available doesn’t prevent anyone from living by their own religious rules. (And since when did the Bible say it’s okay to purchase goods on the Sabbath after noon?) It was no better than the arguments against the repeal offered last month by other Republicans, who said stores needed to be closed so wives could make breakfast for their husbands… or just not spend more money. “Spending time with your wife, your husband — making him breakfast, bringing it to him in bed and then after that go take your kids for a walk,” state Rep. Bernie Santrom said when he denounced a bill that would end the state’s half-day ban on Sunday alcohol sales. His Republican colleague agreed, arguing that he cannot afford his wife having another full day of spending. “I don’t know about you but my wife has no problem spending everything I earn in six and a half days. And I don’t think it hurts at all to have a half day off,” state Rep. Vernon Laning said. Hahahahahahaha, said no one. So those were pathetic explanations. But they weren’t nearly as bad as the reason Republican State Sen. Dick Dever gave… which turned out to be a rant against atheism, Humanism, and separation of church and state. He begins speaking around the 14:55 mark in the video below, and the relevant portion begins at 16:00: … Atheism is a belief system. Atheists believe there is no God. So if it’s a belief system, what is their religion? It’s called Humanism. Also known as Secular Humanism. Also known as Religious Humanism. If you were to Google “Humanism,” you might come to their website, where they talk about separation of church and state and their efforts to bring that about. You would also find what you could call their Bible: Humanist Manifestos I, II, and III… Mr. President, We don’t teach evolution in school because it’s settled science. We teach evolution in school because it’s not Creation. Now why is that important? Well, it’s about control… … … When an atheist goes to court, to take God out of the pledge, to take God out of the classroom, to take God out of the Boy Scouts, they are using the government as a tool to advance their faith in violation of the First Amendment Establishment Clause… … what? Besides just being wrong — most atheists don’t give a damn about the Humanist Manifestos — it’s completely irrelevant. Dever thinks retail stores needed to remain closed on Sunday mornings because opening them would be part of some broader atheist conspiracy to hurt the family unit. I’m also not sure how opening up a car dealership on a Sunday morning advances atheism. Asking for government neutrality on religious issues isn’t pro-atheism. Changing the law to pressure citizens to blaspheme on Sunday mornings? That might advance atheism. But that’s not what’s going on. Instead, the law is specifically designed to promote religion. And that’s why it needs to be repealed. There are ways for the bill to be reconsidered — both in the Senate (again) and by putting it on a ballot for a statewide vote. This isn’t over yet. But it’s appalling that legislators would keep this law on the books when there’s no secular reason for doing so. Their own explanations for why it needs to stay is evidence of that.

Tech Apple Science Cars Geneva Motor Show Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Nintendo Switch Stock Updates: Amazon UK, Amazon Prime Now And GameStop Are Options Posted: Mar 16 2017, 2:56pm CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     The new $299.99 Nintendo Switch is hard to find. Here are the current options to buy a Nintendo Switch. Updated. The new Nintendo Switch was launched on March 3. As expected, it sold out on launch day. Nintendo's comments that there would be enough Switch consoles in March to satisfy demand turned out to be untrue. Don't Miss: Enter the I4U News Nintendo Switch Giveaway! The reseller prices of the Nintendo Switch have honed in on about $465 for the Switch with Gray Joy-Con and $490 for the Switch with Neon Red and Blue Joy-Con. The colorful Switch is slightly harder to find than the console with gray controllers. The premium resellers charge is with 50 to 65% still much lower than it is the case for the Nintendo NES Classic. Amazon has been offering the hard to find Nintendo Switch through its local delivery service Amazon Prime Now. We tracked the Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con in stock for select cities on Amazon Prime Now last week. Customers report on social media to have found the Switch on Amazon Prime Now in their city in the past days. The Lucky customers can receive the Switch with 2 hour free delivery once the Amazon Prime Now. Some Prime Now shoppers have their orders shipped to a UPS store and than forwarded to an address outside the Amazon Prime Now delivery area. Target has started to offer the Nintendo Switch online on Monday. Inventory sold out extremely fast. Also Jet.com had some Switch consoles on sale online. Updates: March 16: Some lucky shoppers spotted the Switch on sale at kohls.com. No tracker is monitoring Kohls, but the inventory still sold out in minutes. March 14: Walmart had the Switch on sale on walmart.com on Tuesday, but might have totally over sold the console. Buyers report that their order is "undefined." The common theme is that their order is backordered. More and more US shoppers are now ordering the Nintendo Switch at Amazon in Spain and also on Amazon UK. This works the same way as for the NES Classic. Amazon UK offers the Nintendo Switch for £279.99 (~ $341) with an in stock date fo on March 31, 2017. Amazon Spain offers the Nintendo Switch for 319 Euro (~ $338), but is currently sold out. The only other option to find a Nintendo Switch we know of are the $500 GameStop Switch bundles with April delivery and of course our Nintendo Switch Giveaway. The video game retailer has started to take pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch with a mid-April delivery date on March 7.  GameStop is offering a $599.99 Nintendo Switch bundle for pre-order with a delivery of April 16th online. GameStop also offers a $509.99 Nintendo Switch Bundle, but that is only available for pre-order in stores. The $599.99 Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con Console Starter Bundle Two includes: Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con Console, Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Expansion Pass, Snipperclips, Just Dance 2017, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild The Complete Official Guide, Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Charging Dock, Nintendo Switch Hybrid Cover, SanDisk Ultra 64GB microSD Card with Adapter, and Power Kit AC-Adapter for Switch. The bundle features sensible items, but not all consumers will need all that stuff. This expensive Nintendo Switch bundle is available for pre-order on gamestop.com. You can also try your luck and win a new Nintendo Switch and a Nintendo NES Classic in our two exclusive I4U News Giveaways. We have both hot Nintendo consoles in the office and are giving them away this month. GameStop says that the Digital Season Pass Code and Digital Game Code Download Instructions will be emailed when orders ship. Items in this bundle may ship separately. GameStop also warns that any products that were sold as part of a bundle are not allowed for return, unless the bundle is returned complete and in sealed new condition. No other store is currently offering the Nintendo Switch online. Below is the list of shops that have carried the Switch at launch. Amazon  Best Buy  GameStop  Target  ToysRUs Nintendo lists six official stores that sell the Nintendo Switch including Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop, Walmart, ToysRUs and Target. Other stores have also listed the Switch including NewEgg, Fry's, BHPPhotoVideo and Nintendo's own store. We expect the Switch to be sold out after Friday and go down a similar route as other successful Nintendo consoles before i t. The Wii was a hard to find console and the surprise NES Classic hit is still very hard to find months after its release. The Nintendo Switch is expected to sell out on launch day and will be hard to find for weeks or even months after launch. Resellers are already preparing to snag up as many Switch consoles to resell them on eBay. Resellers have not yet settled on a profit margin as it is not clear yet how hard the Switch will be to find on launch day. The listings prices are all over the place, ranging from $400 to $1,000. We already received a Nintendo Switch on Thursday that we are giving away. Enter the I4U News Nintendo Switch Giveaway now to get a chance to win a free Nintendo Switch. Nintendo is expected to ship 2 million Switch consoles in March for the global market. The number is too low and finding Nintendo Switch in stock after the initial launch batch sells out is very difficult. The Switch gave Nintendo their biggest console launch ever. The first 2-days of sales beat the Wii and all other Nintendo consoles. The $59.99 NES Classic continues to be also in extreme short supply and Nintendo is unable to ship a significant resupply to resellers in weeks. Nintendo sold through 1.5 million NES Classic consoles and the demand is by far not satisfied. It might take Nintendo until Fall to make enough Switch consoles to satisfy demand. The Switch will be one of the most popular Holiday gifts for the Holiday shopping season 2017.  For video game fans who have not pre-ordered a Switch yet, there are still chances on launch day. There have been midnight launches for the Nintendo Switch at several retailers. The online availability of the Switch is expected to be very limited on launch day. How to Find a Nintendo Switch in stock online To track online inventory and get alerts, shoppers can use zoolert and NowInStock. Both inventory tracker have already setup the Nintendo Switch trackers. We also recommend to use the Chrome browser extension Page Monitor Pro to monitor Nintendo Switch product pages in the hours ahead of the release. How to Find a Nintendo Switch in stock in stores Once the Switch is released, consumers can use BrickSeek to try to find a Switch in stock at Walmart Stores and Target Stores. The Target DPCI for the Nintendo Switch console with neon blue and neon red Joy-Con is 207-29-1001. The DPCI for the Nintendo Switch with grey Joy-Con is 207-29-1000. The Walmart SKU number for the Nintendo Switch with grey Joy-Con is 52901821. The Walmart SKU for the Nintendo Switch with neon blue and new red Joy-Con is 52901822.

Devin Wenig, the current president & CEO of eBay has been under pressure from his board to sketch out a presence in emerging markets. | TNN | Updated: Mar 16, 2017, 08.16 AM IST BENGALURU: E-commerce major Flipkart is learnt to have racked up $1 billion in its latest financing round, bringing on board investors like American online auction site eBay, Chinese internet giant Tencent and Microsoft, multiple people in the know told TOI. The latest fund-raise values the Bengaluru-based firm at $11 billion post the investment, these people said. Flipkart's much-anticipated and widely discussed fund-raise, when announced, would come after a slew of valuation markdowns by existing investors in the backdrop of Jeff Bezos-led Amazon snapping at its heels with a gargantuan war chest. The Indian e-tailer was valued at $15.2 billion when it last raised capital from existing investors in July 2015. When completed, the raise will be the largest capital infusion for an Indian internet startup after Flipkart mopped up $1 billion in July of 2014. Flipkart's been on a fundraising trail since last year when it held talks with strategic players like Alibaba and Walmart. However, those discussions did not conclude in a deal. A spokesperson for the San Jose-based eBay said that the company does not comment on rumour or speculation. Microsoft and Tencent did not respond to queries sent by TOI. A spokesperson of Flipkart said, "As a company policy, we do not comment on market speculations." A source said, "There's been talk of eBay India folding up into Flipkart post the investment. Devin Wenig, the current president & CEO of eBay has been under pressure from his board to sketch out a presence in emerging markets and backing Flipkart seems like a viable bet to take. However, the contours of the deal are yet to be detailed." eBay has a small shareholding in Snapdeal, an investment that hasn't worked out and their own India operations never really took off. Coming in even at this valuation holds promise for eBay considering the potential of the Indian e-commerce market is still huge, said another source. PhonePe, Flipkart's payments business, is also separately in talks to raise funds and has held discussions with PayPal, which is subsidiary of eBay, as reported by TOI in its February 8 edition. Kalyan Krishnamurthy, an ex-Tiger Global MD who took over the reins at Flipkart in June last year, is an ex-eBay executive. Flipkart started stabilising its performance under Krishnamurthy as its sales pipped Amazon's during the Diwali season last year, generating interest from a new set of investors after talks failed with Walmart. New York-based Tiger Global is the largest investor in Flipkart, having pumped in $1billion. Sources said an announcement of Flipkart's funding is likely to come soon.The web retailer's shipments and gross merchandise value, or GMV , has also gone up marginally over the past six months. Sources said, along with Myntra and Jabong, the Flipkart group clocked $4 billion in annual GMV run rate compared to $3 billion by Amazon. Online marketplaces earn anywhere between 5% and 15% -depending on a category -as commission from sellers. "Under Krishnamurthy, Flipkart has gone back to shoring up its smartphone sales once again which is helping it gain momentum in monthly gross sales. The likes of Motorola have made a come back to Flipkart due to the sheer volumes it gets from the platform compared to what these brands got on Amazon," said a person directly aware of the developments. Flipkart inched up its share of mobile phones sold online to 51% in October-December last year compared to Amazon which registered a 33% market share, as per Counterpoint Technology Market Research. Interestingly, Alibaba has also firmed up its India plan by putting $177 million in the Noida-based Paytm to build its commerce business setting the stage for a three-legged battle between Flipkart and the global biggies. Industry insiders said the fresh capital will help Flipkart take on Amazon which has been investing heavily behind its Indian business burning at least $80 million monthly here. The e-commerce juggernaut has not only been discounting on its platform but has launched a slew of products like the subscription-based service Prime.

The Commerce Department said Wednesday retail sales ticked up a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent in February, after a much bigger gain of 0.6 percent the previous month. January’s gain was revised higher. The figures suggest that strong job gains this year, near record-high stock prices and decent pay gains haven’t yet lifted spending. But last month’s sluggish pace could prove temporary. Economists note that spending was likely held back by delays in tax refund payments. A new law has required tougher scrutiny of a tax credit claimed by lower-income taxpayers. Wal-Mart said last month that the delay had slowed sales at its stores in February. Other retailers have reported similar concerns. Tax refunds have started to flow this month, which could trigger a rebound. Coming soon: an app to pay your bar tab NEW YORK — The payment app Qkr backed by Mastercard plans an update that will let bar patrons open, manage and close their tabs. It would all be through the app, so there’s no handing a credit card to a bartender. Restaurants and bars would have to opt in, though, unlike payment apps such as Venmo or Square Cash that let friends settle bills among themselves. Sea pollution research points to microfibers KEY LARGO, Fla. — Researchers say cozy clothes are emerging as a source of plastic that’s increasingly ending up in oceans and possibly contaminating seafood. Microfibers from synthetic fabrics are being found at a much higher rate than the brightly colored plastic spheres the U.S. government banned from rinse-off cosmetic products, the researchers say. The findings suggest that manufacturers of washing machines may need to be targeted next in efforts to reduce plastic waste in oceans. World EU approves proposed AT&T-Time Warner deal BRUSSELS — The European Union has given its blessing to AT&T’s proposed $85 billion purchase of Time Warner, saying that it raises no competition concerns in Europe. The EU’s executive Commission said Wednesday that there are no overlaps between the companies’ activities in the European Economic Area, which includes the 28-nation EU and three other countries. It noted that while AT&T is active in global telecommunications and digital entertainment, it only provides telecommunications services to business customers in the EEA. The deal still needs approval from U.S. regulators. It would bind the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate .

The latest fund-raise values the Bengaluru-based firm at $11 billion post the investment, these people said. Flipkart's much-anticipated and widely discussed fund-raise, when announced, would come after a slew of valuation markdowns by existing investors in the backdrop of Jeff Bezos-led Amazon snapping at its heels with a gargantuan war chest. The Indian e-tailer was valued at $15.2 billion when it last raised capital from existing investors in July 2015. When completed, the raise will be the largest capital infusion for an Indian internet startup after Flipkart mopped up $1 billion in July of 2014. Flipkart's been on a fund-raising trail since last year when it held talks with strategic players like Alibaba and Walmart. However, those discussions did not conclude in a deal. A spokesperson for the San Jose-based eBay said that the company does not comment on rumour or speculation. Microsoft and Tencent did not respond to queries sent by TOI. A spokesperson of Flipkart said, "As a company policy, we do not comment on market speculations." A source who did not want to be named said, "There's been talk of eBay India folding up into Flipkart post the investment. However, the contours of the deal are yet to be detailed." Kalyan Krishnamurthy, an ex-Tiger Global MD who took over the reins of the company in June last year, is an ex-eBay executive. Flipkart started stabilising its performance under Krishnamurthy as its sales pipped Amazon's during the Diwali season last year, generating interest from a new set of investors after talks failed with Walmart. New York-based Tiger Global is the largest investor in Flipkart, having pumped in $1 billion. Sources said an announcement of Flipkart's funding is likely to come soon. The web retailer's shipments and gross merchandise value, or GMV, has also gone up marginally over the past six months. Sources said, along with Myntra and Jabong, the Flipkart group clocked $4 billion in annual GMV run rate compared to $3 billion by Amazon. Online marketplaces earn anywhere between 5% and 15% - depending on a category - as commission from sellers. Under Krishnamurthy, Flipkart has gone back to shoring up its smartphone sales once again, which is helping it gain momentum in monthly gross sales. "The likes of Motorola have made a comeback to Flipkart due to the sheer volumes it gets from the platform compared to what these brands got on Amazon," said a person directly aware of the developments. Flipkart inched up its share of mobile phones sold online to 51% in October-December last year, compared to Amazon which registered a 33% market share, according to Counterpoint Technology Market Research.

(GME) Stock Is the Next Blockbuster — Time to Sell Microsoft's Game Pass isn't a killer for GameStop, but it's another cut to GME By Joseph Hargett, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Mar 15, 2017, 11:30 am EDT     View All   Popular Posts: How to Trade Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(LULU) Stock After Earnings Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Oracle Corporation (ORCL) and Tesla Inc (TSLA) GameStop Corp. (GME) Stock Is the Next Blockbuster — Time to Sell View All Posts It’s time to face the facts. GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) is this generation’s Blockbuster. Earlier this month, Xbox manufacturer Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced Game Pass, a Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)-style monthly online video game rental service similar to Sony Corp (ADR)’s (NYSE:SNE) Playstation Now. Source: Shutterstock While Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass by itself is not enough to tank GME stock and put GameStop out of business, it is the latest in a growing trend toward digital downloads and online offerings, and away from GameStop’s bread and butter of video game disks and physical media. Combine this with continued pricing competition from the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), and the future of GameStop’s bottom line is increasingly in jeopardy. Essentially, GME stock is dying the death of a thousand cuts. Click to Enlarge It’s a trend that you can see just by looking at price action for GameStop stock. GME has been in decline for the better part of the past three years. Since November 2013, the stock has shed more than 55%, with losses accelerating since October 2015 when digital downloads began to gain considerable traction with current-generation gamers. While GME stock has found some price support in recent months due to projections of improving physical media sales following the successful launch of Nintendo Co., Ltd (ADR)’s (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) Switch console, one system won’t be enough to same GameStop’s bottom line. And, if you’ve frequented a GameStop lately, you can see the company realizes this fact as well, with pop culture and video game wearables and collectables now lining many shelves in a move reminiscent of mall-based F.Y.E. stores. Despite the declining stock price and threats to GameStop’s bottom line, Wall Street analysts have yet to catch on. According to Thomson/First Call, only four of the 13 brokerage firms following GME stock rate it below a “buy.” Among those four, there is only one “underperform” designation — and even that was a recent development. But the time for more downgrades may be just around the corner for GME stock. GameStop will step into the earnings confessional on Thursday next week. The consensus is expecting a profit of $2.28 per share, down from earnings of $2.40 per share in the same quarter last year. Revenue is seen slipping 11.7% to $3.11 billion. In yet another sign of optimism from the brokerage community, EarningsWhispers.com reports a whisper number of $2.31 per share for GameStop’s fourth quarter. Failure to live up to these elevated expectations could prompt downgrades or price-target cuts that could send GME stock lower. Looking at the rest of GameStop’s sentiment backdrop, it appears that the brokerage community is the last bastion of bullish sentiment. For instance, short sellers are loaded for bear … literally. Following a 2% increase during the most recent reporting period, the number of GameStop shares sold short now stands at roughly 24 million — representing 28% of the stock’s total float.

See Offers Business Posted Yesterday at 8:03 PM Updated March 15 increase font size Retail sales fail to reflect boost in confidence Economists blame delays in tax refund payments for holding back consumer spending in February. Associated Press Share Comment Read Article WASHINGTON — Americans spent only slightly more last month at retail stores compared with January, a sign of consumer caution despite rising optimism about the economy. The Commerce Department said Wednesday retail sales ticked up a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent in February, after a much bigger gain of 0.6 percent the previous month. January’s gain was revised higher. The figures suggest that strong job gains this year, near record-high stock prices and decent pay gains haven’t yet lifted spending. But last month’s sluggish pace could prove temporary. Economists note that spending was likely held back by delays in tax refund payments. A new law has required tougher scrutiny of a tax credit claimed by lower-income taxpayers. Wal-Mart said last month that the delay had slowed sales at its stores in February. Other retailers have reported similar concerns. Yet tax refunds have started to flow this month, which could trigger a rebound. Economists were also encouraged by the upward revisions to January’s sales data, which point to potentially faster growth in the first three months of the year. A separate report showed inflation rose in February and is now comfortably above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2 percent. The Fed announced its third rate hike in 15 months Wednesday. Sales rose in February at furniture stores and home and garden centers. But they fell sharply at electronics and appliance stores. Sales also fell at gasoline stations, though that mostly reflects lower prices. Clothing stores, sporting goods retailers and department stores also all reported lower sales. There are several additional factors that could drive spending higher in the months ahead. Consumer confidence soared to its highest level in more than 15 years in February, according to the Conference Board, a business research group. Hiring and average hourly pay growth have picked up since the new year. Americans’ finances are in better shape, with average home prices back to their pre-recession levels in much of the country. Yet the boost in confidence may not be broadly shared. That could limit any spending that might result. For Americans younger than age 35, who are less likely than older age groups to own a home or stocks, confidence actually fell last month. And the consumer confidence data has grown increasingly political in recent years, with Republicans reporting much greater optimism than Democrats. That reverses a pattern that emerged under former President Barack Obama. Retail sales make up about one-third of total consumer spending, with the other two-thirds consisting of health care and other services. Spending makes up about 70 percent of the economy. Growth has yet to catch up with the recent burst of optimism that has followed Donald Trump’s election. Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

Legislature 56,000 sign petition organized by the B.C. Federation of Labour and tabled by NDP Leader John Horgan By Jon Hernandez, CBC News Posted: Mar 15, 2017 4:29 PM PT Last Updated: Mar 16, 2017 10:12 AM PT A petition to raise B.C.'s minimum wage organized by the B.C. Federation of Labour was filled by 56,000 signatures from across the province. (Karin Larsen/CBC) Petition for $15 per hour minimum wage delivered to B.C. legislature 25:20 Related Stories $15 minimum wage will hurt local economy, young workers, says Surrey Board of Trade B.C. raising minimum wage today to $10.85 Western Hockey League exempt from paying players minimum wage as CHL lawsuit looms B.C. to look into legislation allowing women to refuse wearing high heels at work Over 56,000 British Columbians have signed off on a petition to raise province's minimum wage to $15 per hour. The petition, spearheaded by the B.C. Federation of Labour, was brought to the B.C. Legislature on Wednesday in hopes of making minimum wage an election issue. According to the organization's president Irene Lanzinger, over 500,000 workers in B.C. earn minimum wage. "Even if they work full time, they live below the poverty line," she told host Angela Sterrit on CBC's B.C. Almanac. "[Their income is] $4,000 below the poverty line." Of the half million minimum wage earners, 60 per cent are women, and over 70,000 are above the age of 55, said the president. Lanzinger says the bulk of employees work for large companies like Walmart and McDonalds, that "are earning big profits on the backs of low wage workers." The petition was tabled by NDP Leader John Horgan. He maintains that his party would increase the minimum wage should they be voted into office. B.C. NDP promises $15 per hour minimum wage if elected in 2017 Minimum wage in the province is currently $10.85 per hour, up 40 cents as of September, 2016. Prior to the increase, B.C.'s minimum wage was the lowest in the country. Impacts on small business But there are concerns on the effect a potential increase could have on the livelihood of small business. According to Val Litwin, president and CEO for the B.C. Chamber of Commerce, a sharp increase in minimum wage could have a damaging effect on businesses that employ low wage workers. "[We're] not against seeing that minimum wage go up," he said. "It's about doing it with certainty and with predictability." "If that minimum wage goes up in massive or quick increments, it can challenge the viability of a business model." Litwin says a gradual increase in minimum wage, such as current increases put in place by the B.C. Liberals that are based on the Consumer Price Index, are more viable in the long-term. "This is about making sure the economy is thriving. We all want a thriving economy where there's great paying job for people, but we also have to support business to make sure they can keep hiring people and growing." The province plans on increasing B.C.'s minimum wage to $11.35 by the end of the year. B.C. minimum wage to hit $11.25 by 2017 With files from CBC's B.C.

She said a supposed buyer sent her a check in the mail and added additional funds so she could pay a mover to pick up the dress. She deposited the check and wired $1,380 to an address in Michigan. She later learned the check was fraudulent and the bank withdrew the money from her account. Officers attempted to contact the supposed buyer but his Ebay account had been closed. They learned it had only been created the day the buyer contacted the woman. Burglary, Wyncote Road: A man and his roommate reported several items missing from their home March 3. There were no signs of forced entry and the front door was believed to have been left unlocked, possibly by another roommate. A neighbor said it is a "college house" and there are usually a lot of people there. Among the items reported missing were two Xbox game consoles, two laptop computers, a watch, $100 cash and two back packs. Weapons offense, Felton Road: A resident reported March 2 he found a bullet hole in the wall of his rear porch and a copper bullet in the corner of the porch. He had been out of town for several weeks and did not know when the bullet would have been fired at the home. A neighbor said he heard the sound of gun fire about two or three weeks earlier coming from the area of Holmden Road between 10 p.m and midnight. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A man reported March 4 he unknowingly dropped his wallet when making a purchase at Walmart and when he returned to the store to retrieve it, there was $79 in cash missing from it. Surveillance video was reviewed and showed the wallet was picked up by the woman who was in line behind him. She took it to the customer service area to turn it in but stopped in the restroom first for about 20 seconds. A store employee said he would try to identify the woman. Harassing communication, Stilmore Road: A man reported March 2 he was getting threatening messages and phone calls from his ex-girlfriend. He said the nature of the messages was in regards to the father of her child being released from prison and her being worried about him being harmed if the man found out about their relationship. The man could not show officers any messages that referenced any threats and he was told to stop answering the calls because it creates difficulty in pursuing a harassment charge. The man told officers "you need to make this stop or I will." They told him that statement could be considered a threat against the woman. Officers tried unsuccessfully to contact the 28-year-old Cleveland Heights woman. Weapons offense, Acacia Drive: Officers responded to multiple reports of gunshots being heard around 12:10 a.m. March 6. They were unable to determine the source, but located two spent casings on the roadway in the intersection of Langerdale Road. One man said he heard five gunshots and saw a vehicle drive off very quickly. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland Heights man, 29, was arrested at Walmart March 6 for theft without consent. He had gone to the self-checkout register with two cordless toothbrushes, but only scanned the less expensive one. He then asked an associate to void that purchase because he decided he didn't want it. He never scanned or returned the more expensive item. Unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, Ardmore Road: A man reported March 3 his daughter, 16, took her mother's vehicle without his permission after an argument. While officers were speaking with the man, they learned the girl was at the police station filing a report against him for domestic violence, stemming from a prior incident. Officers took the man to the station, where he retrieved the vehicle's keys. They recommended the girl be charged in juvenile court for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. The man denied all allegations of assault from the incident the girl reported. Child and family services were contacted about the incident. See more South Euclid news at cleveand.com/south-euclid.

There were other immigrants who came here in the bottom of slave ships, worked even longer, even harder, for less. But they, too, had a dream that one day their sons, daughters, grandsons, granddaughters, great-grandsons, great-granddaughters, might pursue prosperity and happiness in this land.” Carson got hammered. Late-night comic Trevor Noah said: “It makes them sound like they work at Wal-Mart. … Calling slaves ‘immigrants’ is like saying: ‘It’s not kidnapping. That person just got a free vacation in a basement.’ … Slaves weren’t immigrants. Because an immigrant has choice. They choose the country they’re going to because they hope it will bring them a better life. Saying that slaves are just another group of immigrants erases how black people were uniquely oppressed in America. It helps justify blaming African-Americans for their hardships.” Actor Samuel L. Jackson tweeted: “OK!! Ben Carson … I can’t! Immigrants? In the bottom of SLAVE SHIPS??!! MUTHAF–– PLEASE!!! #d–-headedtom.” Actress Whoopi Goldberg said: “Were the slaves really thinking about the American dream? No, because they were thinking, ‘What the hell just happened?!’ You know, when people immigrate, they come with the idea that they’re going someplace for a better life. … It’s voluntary. … How does he miss what slavery is?! How does he miss that no slave came to this country willingly? … Ben, ‘Roots.’ Watch ‘Roots.'” TV personality Star Jones tweeted: “No way in the world he is that friggin ignorant.” Using the pile-of-excrement emoji, she called the renowned neurosurgeon “(expletive) for brains.” She ended the tweet: “#UncleTom thy name is #BenCarson.” Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., insists that Carson’s “slave equals immigrant” perspective means he is unqualified to lead HUD because Carson “doesn’t know how urgent it is to confront racism” in housing: “It’s disturbing to me, and it should be to every American, not just black Americans. … For him, the HUD secretary, to have a stunning misunderstanding of history like that, is really, really striking. … And so for the HUD secretary not to get that means that he doesn’t know how urgent it is to confront racism and discrimination in housing, which is a very scary thing for the HUD secretary to not understand.” Following the uproar, Carson posted this clarification on Facebook: “The slave narrative and immigrant narrative are two entirely different experiences. … The two experiences should never be intertwined, nor forgotten, as we demand the necessary progress towards an America that’s inclusive and provides access to equal opportunity for all.” One slight problem. The “insensitive” and “demeaning” slave-equals-immigrant argument was made on a number of occasions by President Barack Obama: “It wasn’t always easy for new immigrants,” Obama said at a 2015 naturalization ceremony for new citizens. “Certainly it wasn’t easy for those of African heritage who had not come here voluntarily, and yet in their own way were immigrants themselves. There was discrimination and hardship and poverty. But, like you, they no doubt found inspiration in all those who had come before them. And they were able to muster faith that, here in America, they might build a better life and give their children something more.” Even “Daily Show” host Noah admitted, “President Obama said something similar in 2015.” But, said Noah, “You could tell before (Obama) said that part he was thinking, ‘Damn, my speechwriter f–-ed up.'” In fact, according to the Federalist, Obama likened slaves to immigrants on 11 different occasions. “Whether our ancestors landed on Ellis Island,” said Obama, “or came here on a slave ship or crossed the Rio Grande, we are all connected to one another. We rise and fall together.” Goldberg, Noah, Jackson and Ellison were obviously occupied the 11 times Obama showed he “doesn’t know how urgent it is to confront racism.” Why the silence over Obama’s many slave-equals-immigrant comments versus the desk pounding by the same critics when Carson says the same thing? Carson represents an existential threat to the left. He is deadly to their cause – a black man, raised in poverty by a hardworking, welfare-abstaining single mom who taught her children to embrace hard work and education. The left believes that blacks are perpetual victims of slavery, Jim Crow and racism. It is vital for the existence of the Democratic Party to convince blacks to vote like victims in need of protection from the racist, sexist retrogrades known as Republicans. So black conservatives like Carson, who argues that welfare creates dependency, who demands choice in K-12 education and who believes hard work wins, must be attacked, marginalized and dismissed as “against their own people.” Receive Larry Elder's commentaries in your email BONUS: By signing up for Larry Elder's alerts, you will also be signed up for news and special offers from WND via email.

To combat this, and other homelessness related problems, legislators in St. Paul met on Tuesday to begin efforts to fund various programs with the intention of helping the state’s homeless in greater Minnesota. (Photo courtesy of Pixabay) spotlight Lawmakers pursue legislation to curb homelessness in cities like Faribault By GUNNAR OLSON golson@faribault.com Mar 15, 2017 Updated 21 hrs ago (…) Homelessness takes many forms in the Faribault area, including people staying in units without their names on the lease, or sleeping in a car or other structures. To combat this, and other homelessness related problems, legislators in St. Paul met on Tuesday to begin efforts to fund various programs with the intention of helping the state’s homeless in greater Minnesota. (Photo courtesy of Pixabay) Homelessness in Faribault does not look like it does in major cities. The cardboard shelters, the shopping carts and the cups full of change are an unlikely sign of homelessness locally, but those working to prevent the issue from growing say it’s still prevalent. “I’ve heard stories of people walking the aisles of 24-7 Wal-Marts, and I’ve heard stories of folks who go into hospitals and look for rooms with empty beds and hope that no one will find them until morning,” said Senta Leff, executive director of the Minnesota Coaltition for the Homeless. “They’re less visible in these rural communities, but they are no less present.” LaJune Troolin, of Faribault’s St. Vincent de Paul, a local charity that helps homeless people seek shelter, warm clothing and food, said that Faribault’s homeless are having a hard time finding someplace to go. “They walk Wal-Mart or sleep in the laundromat,” said Troolin. “They don’t want to leave Faribault and they won’t give us a good answer why. That’s what we are hearing here.” Amy Tudor, of Three Rivers Community Action in Faribault, said that homelessness in the area normally takes the form of people living in rental units without their names on the lease or people sleeping in their cars. “I know a guy who spent a couple of months sleeping in storage sheds just trying to find a warm place to be,” said Tudor. “You don’t necessarily see them under the bridge or on the street corner, but that doesn’t mean it’s not happening.” Troolin believes the homeless in Faribault need a place to stay. She said Ruth’s House of Hope “has been a great help for the women,” but in the county, there are limited resources like that for men. “I just feel our smaller towns do need some kind of a place for them to stay,” she said. “We couldn’t begin to get into something like that, but I’d love to see people get off the street. We just don’t have a place for them.” Troolin said that St. Vincent does what it can to help the homeless find short-term fixes to their problem by putting them up in local hotels, but added that the charity cannot afford to do it regularly. To help in other areas, St. Vincent gives away clothing like mittens and boots and also provides homeless people with the food it collects each week. Despite their best efforts, homelessness continues to rise in the area, according to Three Rivers. Tudor said the trend is due, in part, to a lack of affordable housing. In 2017, rental rates went up across the city. Tudor said that the low end of a two-bedroom apartment was nearly $875 per month. “I wish we could do a lot more, but we don’t have the resources,” Troolin said of how they hope to combat the problem. According to legislators in St. Paul, areas like Faribault are not alone in the shortage of homeless shelters. More than 700 volunteers registered for Homeless Day at the Capitol, which was organized by the Minnesota Coalition for the Homeless. Taking place on Tuesday, advocates discussed with legislators how to combat homelessness and housing barriers in Minnesota. Among them was Tudor with Three Rivers Community Action, who advocated with Faribault Senator John Jasinski. The Minnesota Housing Partnership recently found that more than 9,300 Minnesotans are homeless. Of those, more than one-third are children and 843 of them are senior citizens. In Faribault, the school district reported this school year that 112 students, or 2.9 percent of the student population, are homeless or highly mobile. “People who are struggling with homelessness are dealing with circumstances out of their control,” said Tudor of the characteristics of the problem. “They are not so different from you and I. A lot of people are a car breakdown away from being homeless. They aren’t living off handouts, they are really trying.” At the Capitol As this issue persists, a bipartisan sampling of legislators and advocates has expressed support for homeless legislation for greater Minnesota. The coalition supports a bill by Rep. Rod Hamilton, R-Mountain Lake, which seeks to add $6.5 million over the next two years to the state’s affordable housing efforts. Additionally, that funding would help pay for emergency, long-term and transitional housing for homeless populations. It would also assist homeless Minnesotans with serious mental illnesses. Another residual effect of this problem was brought up by Rep. Nels Pierson during a panel discussion at the Capitol. The Rochester Republican also spoke at the event at the Capitol and expressed his worries about how unstable housing affects children. “It’s an issue where that instability causes anxiety,” he said. “For a young mind that’s supposed to be focused on school work, that’s not a good place to be.” Pierson introduced a bill that would increase the Minnesota Family Investment Program cash assistance by $100 per month. The program provides a monthly maximum of $532 in temporary cash assistance to parents working toward full-time employment. The amount has not changed since 1986. As part of the Homes for All initiative, the coalition also supports a bill that would add $130 million in spending toward affordable housing over the next two years. Willmar Republican Dave Baker sponsored the bill that would increase funding to a number of areas including a family homeless prevention assistance fund, rental assistance for highly mobile students and the homeless, a program to keep homeless individuals with mental illnesses off the waitlist for federal housing assistance and more. Duluth Rep. Liz Olson, a Democrat, said the funding would help improve access to affordable housing in areas where the median-income workforce struggles to pay rent. A former homeless shelter employee, Olson said reducing homelessness is not a partisan issue, but rather a “Minnesota issue.” “That’s why, as someone who put in work on these issues from an advocacy standpoint and work on this as a legislator, I’ve been so pleased to see Homes for All garner bipartisan support,” she said. Homelessness takes many forms across the state of Minnesota, but legislators in St. Paul are hoping to find new ways to help. Troolin said that she “would like to see some of that money come down here” to start a new shelter. In the meantime, she will continue to do all she can.

Alisa Tang/Thomson Reuters Foundation | Caption Loading... Alisa Tang Thomson Reuters Foundation March 15, 2017 Bangkok, Thailand—Aliya Harir was an impressionable teenager who soaked up the patriotic propaganda from her schoolbooks and the one TV channel that served her town in the mountains of northern Pakistan. So she feared, and hated, India. "There were always rumors that India's going to attack Pakistan soon, and I was always worried: Where would I hide if an Indian soldier comes?" Harir, now 25, said as she laughed, embarrassed at her younger self. Then in 2011, she was accepted into an exchange program to spend six months at Troy University in the southern U.S. state of Alabama. As she settled into school, a Nepali student drove her to Walmart and brought along a friend. Exchanging pleasantries, Harir asked the friend where he was from and was shocked to find out he was Indian. Promoting peace through interpersonal and global unity "I had never thought I would meet Indians – I only thought I would meet Indians if there was a war, if the Indians came in to kill us. But the Indian I met was a human being, just like me," she said in Bangkok on the sidelines of a U.N.-supported conference aimed at supporting women peacebuilders. Pakistan and India have been locked in acrimonious conflict and border skirmishes for decades, since partition and independence from Britain in 1947. The fighting and animosity infuse the countries' politics, as well as films and nationalistic TV programs. Harir's epiphany in the United States led her on a quest – to promote India-Pakistan peace by connecting children from both countries, both online and in person. Promoting peace through interpersonal and global unity Upon her return to Pakistan, Harir found like-minded people in Delhi and Islamabad and launched Aaghaz-e-Dosti, a "friendship initiative" focused on conflict resolution. Aaghaz-e-Dosti, meaning "beginning of friendship," brings Indian activists, teachers and journalists to classrooms in Pakistan, and pairs up children on both sides of the border to be online buddies for eight-week peacebuilding courses. Harir, who now lives in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, said the initiative works with young children to counter state propaganda and negative stereotypes. "We are focused on children and young students from primary to secondary grades because that is the critical and formative stage of the development of a child," she said. Harir – the second of four children in a family from the minority Shi'ite Ismaili Muslim sect – faced discrimination herself growing up in a predominantly Sunni Muslim Pakistan. "When this debate of Sunnis versus Ismailis came up, I used to feel ashamed. I used to cry, 'Oh God, why was I born an Ismaili?' I never discussed it with my parents. I didn't have the courage to," she said. Her father, who had lived in Australia and Britain, owned a tourism company and used to host foreigners, so one of Harir's teachers once asked her if she shared meals with "infidels." "I started shivering. What do I answer? I have to respect him.... He said, 'It's wrong. You should never sit with them, you should never eat with them.' " Raised amid prejudice, she was amazed that in the United States she made Indian friends who brought her home-cooked food and invited her to parties. The differences melted away as similarities emerged: Pakistanis and Indians love cricket and Bollywood movies, Harir said, adding that the food was the same, and even their languages, Urdu and Hindi, were similar. Then one day she fell ill and began to vomit blood. She was flown by helicopter to hospital in Birmingham and treated for tuberculosis. She stayed almost a month. Her Indian friends drove three hours to keep her company with Bollywood movies and food from Indian restaurants. "I changed a lot. I felt ashamed," she recalled, shaking her head. Since returning to Pakistan five years ago, Harir has been to India five times, bringing groups of Pakistani students for the Global Youth Peace Festival in the northern Indian city of Chandigarh and Aaghaz-e-Dosti meetings. Last October, Harir led a group of 20 female students to India, and during their trip, tensions between the two countries escalated again. Having learned of the student delegation, India's Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj worried about their safety and contacted Harir to assure her they would get home safely. Responding to Harir's note of thanks on Twitter, Swaraj's note of concern was retweeted more than 3,000 times. But Harir does have detractors. "People call me anti-national. They say, 'If you love India so much, go and live in India,' " she said. Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

Last month, Tyson Foods announced a “no antibiotics ever” pledge for all Tyson-branded chicken products, building on an earlier promise to restrict drug use on broiler chickens. Analysts see the latest announcement as further evidence of a trend of large companies limiting pharmaceuticals that scientists believe increases drug-resistance for treating pneumonia, infections and other illnesses. The wave started in 2014 with Perdue Chicken and chicken-based fast-food chain Chick-fil-A, followed by McDonald’s, Wal-Mart Stores, Pilgrim’s Pride and others. The announcements vary in scope, with some companies, for example, still permitting use of ionophores, antibiotics not used in human medicine. The shift follows warnings about antibiotic resistance from health officials and a September 2016 United Nations General Assembly resolution that pledged coordinated action to address overuse. “We’re seeing a cry from consumers for meat that’s responsibly raised,” said Lena Brook, a food policy advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). Still, the breadth of the movement should not be overstated. While an estimated 40 to 50 percent of US chicken now is antibiotic-free, the percentage is far lower for pork and beef. Moreover, several leading companies have resisted action. Kentucky Fried Chicken, part of Yum Brands, currently scores an “F” on an NRDC scorecard on antibiotics policy, while Sanderson Farms, a leading US chicken producer, has lampooned the trend. “There’s certainly strong and growing demand for it today, but to what extent it’s a fad or a long-term trend remains to be seen,” said Zain Akbari, a food industry analyst at Morningstar. Experts in animal farm science say for decades US farmers routinely employed antibiotics as a means to speed growth rates for animals, and to prevent disease outbreaks on farms where animals are frequently packed in close quarters. But an April 2014 World Health Organization report warned of the potential for a “post-antibiotic era” in which “common infections and minor injuries can kill” as drugs become ineffective. In voluntary guidelines that took effect in January, the US Food and Drug Administration said antibiotics in agriculture should be limited to medically necessary uses and not for weight gain. The call by officials has dovetailed with heightened consciousness about food in broader American society that has also propelled organic food. Instead of antibiotics, Tyson is turning to probiotics and to botanicals such as oregano and thyme for routine treatment, while still employing antibiotics if birds become sick, a spokesman said. Tyson, which has faced shareholder resolutions in recent years on its water policy and other sustainability issues, also plans to limit antibiotics in pork, beef and turkey, although it has not yet set target dates. “We’re eliminating human antibiotics because it’s the most responsible approach to balance a global health concern and animal well-being,” a Tyson spokesman said. “Antibiotics resistance is a very complex issue with no single cause and no single solution. It’s a global concern and we want to be part of the solution.” As other companies have done, Tyson began with chicken, in part because chicken farms tend to be vertically organized within companies, compared with pork and beef, which involve contracts with outside farmers. That means the company would need to institute programs that impact its suppliers, analysts say. Advocates of stricter antibiotic use are pressing for action on beef and pork too, and are preparing a shareholder resolution for McDonald’s annual meeting. Since beef already has more premium grades, adding antibiotic-free products could be another opportunity to introduce a pricier product, said Akbari, the Morningstar analyst. Akbari said much of the current push is in response to millennials, who increasingly will “force retailers and producers to be pretty nimble.” Still, organic-minded millennials are not the only key segment in the vast US food market. Sanderson Farms last summer unveiled a marketing blitz in which a pair of folksy, baseball-cap wearing consumers mock the antibiotic-free craze in television ads that question the scientific link of agriculture to the growth of drug resistance and the wisdom of paying more for antibiotic-free chicken. Joe Sanderson, chief executive of the 62-year-old Mississippi company, defended the company’s stance in a February 23 conference call. “Everybody does not want that product,” Sanderson said. “And everybody does not believe the claims on that product and nor is that claim important to everybody.” iDEAL <script language='javascript' src='http://www2.shanghaidaily.com/showadcode.asp?w=300&h=250&posid=31&x=js'></script> <script language='javascript' src='http://www2.shanghaidaily.com/showadcode.asp?w=300&h=250&posid=55&x=js'></script> Most Read Today Weekly Monthly What did Premier Li say during the press conference?

Case and point: a self-described Chinese-Peruvian woman was prompted to defend a Muslim couple on a New York City subway train, while another woman – of Puerto Rican descent, no less – spewed her hate speech concerning Muslims entering the U.S. READ: Ill-Informed White Man Slams Latina Employee And Disabled Person At Walmart The altercation was published on YouTube by Mañanero TV days ago, and soon went viral after some well-known media outlets shared it on Facebook. The Latina who steps in to defend the couple swiftly issues a lesson on solidarity: I’m not telling you to be quiet, I’m asking you to please respect her in Spanish, in English, in Chinese, in French ― whatever language you want me to tell you in. I will say it to you. Whether you’re born here, Puerto Rico or wherever you are from. Because I am born here and I don’t like the way you’re treating her. It’s rude. We’re here in it together, OK? We’re all in this together, whether we like what’s going on in the government or not. F**k it, we have to deal with it. You’re a grown woman, you suck it up and you defend your brothers and sisters because that’s what you are. If you’re a part of this country, you’re brothers and sisters. In the video below, the two are seen going back and forth as the culprit in question nearly inaudibly says why she’s upset. By the near end of the video, we learn it’s merely because the man fits the description of a Muslim or Indian.

This struggle strikes at the core of our omnivorous nature, while tugging at our heart strings, tempting our palates, challenging our intellects and presenting myriad health impacts. The more I learn about the impact the world's livestock practices have on world hunger, our changing climate and other facets of our environment, the more foolhardy and selfish eating animal products appears to be — unless, perhaps, you're raising or hunting your own, or purchasing from a livestock operation that's sensitive to its environmental footprint. By contrast, consumer interest in the quality of life experienced by the animals that provide us their meat, organs and secretions has spiked. The likes of Walmart and McDonalds are happy to oblige, having pledged to phase out their use of chicken eggs that were laid in a cage. Whether the chickens are truly any better off is an open question. Fortunately, in Charlotte, there are plenty of vegetarian and vegan options, and the list of totally vegan restaurants continues to rise — in addition to local mainstays Fern in Plaza-Midwood, Bean on Independence Boulevard, Luna's in South End, and ZiZi's in the University area, there's the new One Life Raw Juice Bar in Myers Park. More are sure to come. A growing supply of vegan products are also available everywhere from your neighborhood Harris Teeter to Bean's little in-restaurant grocery store. Not coincidentally, 2016 was the year the veggie burger came into its own, largely on the back of the Impossible Burger. This plant-based, umami-rich burger sizzles and browns in the pan, and sheds plant-based red blood with each bite you take. Even the least apologetic of meat eaters surveyed have admitted to respecting the Impossible Burger, fortified with wheat and potato protein and lubed with coconut oil. The fake animal product space has also exploded with the likes of vegan cheese alternatives made from cultured nuts, pink-hued fake shrimp and crab meat, nut- and grain-based "milk" products like almond milk and soy milk, egg-free "mayo," and all kinds of vegan substitutes for egg, chicken and most every other piece of flesh or fluid you can imagine. It's not just vegans that are are into this stuff. Locavores, climatarians, ovo-lacto-paleo-bacon-vores, and good old-fashioned omnivorous are finding their way to animal product-free alternatives for entirely different reasons. Me, I eat meat. Mostly wild game, for which I feel zero guilt, assuming the hunt goes well. While I don't avoid animal products as a rule, for phlegm-related reasons I do limit my intake of mammal milk products. I know it isn't cool to admit it, but I like soy milk. I like milk, too. And heavy cream. And cheese, though I long ago settled on mayonnaise as my go-to cheese alternative. In recent years I've determined that Vegenaise, specifically the grapeseed oil formulation, is the best mayo on the market — and for reasons that are completely unrelated to the fact that it doesn't contain eggs. I scoop Vegenaise greedily upon my deer, my scrambled eggs, my beef or veggie burger, and I'm good. Bloodthirsty omnivore that I am, I'm part of the fake-animal-products market. "I'd say about 70 percent of our customers are not vegan and not vegetarian," Charlie Foesch, co-owner of Bean Vegan Cuisine, told Cretive Loafing in a recent story on the restaurant. The various animal products industries have not been pleased with these developments, and they pushed back in a big way last year. Unilever, owner of the Hellman's and Best Foods brands of mayo, took vegan food processor Hampton Creek to court for using the word "mayo" on the label of its egg-free mayonnaise substitute, Just Mayo. The National Dairy Council attempted, and failed, to make it illegal to use the word "milk" to describe nut- and grain-based milk substitutes like soy or almond milk. Makers of cultured nut products have similarly lost their ability to label their products as "cheese." It seems a matter of when — and not if — the beef industry goes after the Impossible Burger over its use of the word "burger." While many vegetarian diets often attempt to recreate animal products from plant-based ingredients, resulting in the likes of bleeding burgers and Tofurky, this is not to be confused with vegetable-based cuisine. Vegetable cookery doesn't carry the implicit inferiority complex that comes with constantly serving pretend meat. Rather, it celebrates the inherent qualities of the vegetable or plant part in question. So my prediction for this year doubles as a recommendation: don't sleep on plain vegetables. Even as you nerd out to a Silicon Valley burger-patty formulation that's precisely calculated to satisfy your body's nutritional needs while simultaneously saving the earth and tickling your taste buds, don't forget plain, normal vegetables. With each passing study, and with each passing year, vegetables continue to accumulate almost zero baggage. There's no debate over the pros and cons of vegetables, because it has been settled and confirmed. Vegetables are good and not bad. Luckily, one of the bigger food trends of last year will likely grow stronger in 2017: the push to sell imperfect produce, or so-called "ugly" fruits and vegetables, at a discounted rate. Like cage-free eggs, imperfect produce is available at Walmart. All due respect to vegetables, beautiful and ugly alike, but animals are not necessarily always bad. In fact, there is an increasingly solid argument to be made in favor of our eating them. Some of them, anyway. Public understanding and perceptions of fat continue to be turned inside out, especially relating to saturated fat, which has long been assumed to be the culprit behind obesity and related ailments, such as heart disease. Once practically unassailable, this position is now being openly questioned, as expert opinion is shifting to the camp that regards sugar as the primary dietary culprit behind obesity. "Saturated fat" is a fancy way of saying "animal fat," but with one big exception: a pair of oils, coconut and palm, derived from closely related tree species. Saturated fats are increasingly understood to benefit brain health, as well as other crucial body functions. Meanwhile, the relative merits of unsaturated fats — especially those found in grain-based oils like canola, safflower, sunflower and soy — seem to worsen the more we learn about omega-6 fatty acids, in which the grain-based oils are high. (Olive oil and other fruit and nut oils are in a vastly better category of plant oil, with more omega-3.) And it isn't clear that all meat is bad for the environment, either. A vocal minority of ranchers are making the ecology-based case that certain landscapes can benefit from properly managed herds of certain ungulates. In the absence of buffalo and similar animals, many ecosystems could spin out of control without tasty grazers like cows filling that vital niche. Rotational grazing, if done correctly, can result in healthier ecosystems and carbon sequestration, proponents claim. It's a compelling vision, but even if it's true, the cattle-carrying capacity of the landscape is much less under rotational grazing than under feedlot rules. If the world were to make a dramatic switch to rotational grazing, it would mean a lot less meat to go around. But here's another prediction: the global cattle industry will not be switching from feedlots to rotational grazing systems anytime soon.

Puskar) U.S. spending at retail stores up slightly last month By: The Associated Press March 15, 2017 12:18 pm 0 WASHINGTON — Americans spent only slightly more last month at retail stores compared with January, a sign of consumer caution despite rising optimism about the economy. The Commerce Department said Wednesday retail sales ticked up a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent in February, after a much bigger gain of 0.6 percent the previous month. January’s gain was revised higher. The figures suggest that strong job gains this year, near record-high stock prices and decent pay gains haven’t yet lifted spending. But last month’s sluggish pace could prove temporary. Economists note that spending was likely held back by delays in tax refund payments. A new law has required tougher scrutiny of a tax credit claimed by lower-income taxpayers. Wal-Mart said last month that the delay had slowed sales at its stores in February. Other retailers have reported similar concerns. Yet tax refunds have started to flow this month, which could trigger a rebound. Economists were also encouraged by the upward revisions to January’s sales data, which point to potentially faster growth in the first three months of the year. A separate report showed inflation rose in February and is now comfortably above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2 percent. “Inflation is trending gradually higher and underlying retail sales are healthy enough,” said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. Sales rose in February at furniture stores and home and garden centers. But they fell sharply at electronics and appliance stores. Sales also fell at gasoline stations, though that mostly reflects lower prices. Clothing stores, sporting goods retailers and department stores also all reported lower sales. There are several additional factors that could drive spending higher in the months ahead. Consumer confidence soared to its highest level in more than 15 years in February, according to the Conference Board, a business research group. Hiring and average hourly pay growth have picked up since the new year. Americans’ finances are in better shape, with average home prices back to their pre-recession levels in much of the country. Yet the boost in confidence may not be broadly shared. That could limit any spending that might result. For Americans younger than age 35, who are less likely than older age groups to own a home or stocks, confidence actually fell last month. And the consumer confidence data has grown increasingly political in recent years, with Republicans reporting much greater optimism than Democrats. That reverses a pattern that emerged under former President Obama. Retail sales make up about one-third of total consumer spending, with the other two-thirds consisting of health care and other services. Economists closely monitor spending, because it makes up about 70 percent of the economy. Growth has yet to catch up with the recent burst of optimism that has followed Donald Trump’s election. The economy expanded at a modest 1.9 percent pace in the final three months of last year. Most economists expect it will grow at roughly a 2 percent pace in the January-March quarter.

La Monica NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- It's a good time to be a banker. President Trump is expected to roll back some of the financial regulations that were put into place during the Obama administration. And the Federal Reserve is expected to give banks another gift Wednesday in the form of an interest rate hike. Higher rates tend to make loans to people and businesses more profitable for big banks. That's made investors giddy. Bank of America's stock has soared 15% this year. JPMorgan Chase is up 6% and not far from an all-time high. So is scandal-ridden Wells Fargo. And a top bank ETF, the Financial Select Sector SPDR fund, is up 7% in 2017. So how much longer can the bank party last? Trump expected to be more friend than foe It's still not clear how Trump may seek to change the package of regulations known as Dodd-Frank. But he signed two directives last month after meeting with bankers -- and that has made investors more confident. One called for a review of the Wall Street reform law, and the other delayed the implementation of what's known as the fiduciary rule, a regulation that requires financial advisers to put their clients' best interests first -- not those of their firms. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, arguably the nation's best-known and most respected banker, has expressed optimism about the changes in Washington, too. He said in the bank's earnings release in January that "there is opportunity for good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented, which would spur growth, create jobs for Americans across the income spectrum and help communities." Dimon is one of 16 CEOs on Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum, an advisory group that includes IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, Disney CEO Bob Iger, GM CEO Mary Barra and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon. And now he's chairman of the Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs that promotes business-friendly policies in Washington. Dimon, answering a question from CNNMoney during a press call after the earnings report in January, also said he is "comforted" that Trump has put "professionals" in the administration. Those include ex-Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross as commerce secretary and former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state. Mnuchin isn't the only Goldman alum in the Trump administration. Former chief operating officer Gary Cohn heads Trump's Council of Economic Advisors. Dina Powell, who was in charge of many of Goldman's philanthropic efforts, is now a senior adviser to Trump too. He also has nominated Goldman veteran Jim Donovan to be Mnuchin's deputy in the Treasury department. And even though Trump's nominee to lead the SEC, lawyer Jay Clayton, isn't technically a former Goldman employee, he has represented Goldman and other large banks. Clayton's wife also works for Goldman. Don't fight the Fed Banks may have another ally in Washington besides Trump and his army of Vampire Squids: Fed chair Janet Yellen. The Fed already raised rates in December. That followed a hike in December 2015 -- its first since 2006. But Yellen -- who may or may not still be Fed chair in 2018 after her term expires next February -- has suggested the Fed could boost rates several times this year and next year. Any increase in the Fed's benchmark lending rate would allow banks to charge more interest on mortgages, credit cards, auto leases, small business loans and other forms of debt. What's more, any signals from Yellen that the Fed will keep gradually raising rates could push more companies to make deals before the cost of borrowing money becomes too high. More startups may look to go public, as well. The environment for stocks tends to be more favorable when rates are lower. There are already hopes on Wall Street that Snapchat's recent IPO could pave the way for other high-profile unicorns like Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest and SpaceX to file for initial public offerings of their own. And any pickup in merger activity and IPOs would be a boon to big banks like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and BofA because it would mean more advisory fees. Finally, higher interest rates could lead more people to put money in savings accounts, which would also help banks. Many Americans, particularly those nearing retirement or already retired, feel that the Fed has been punishing savers by keeping rates too low. Money put in a good, old-fashioned bank account has earned next to nothing for years. So it looks like even happier days may lie ahead for banks and their investors -- as long as Trump and Yellen live up to their promises. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Economists were also encouraged by the upward revisions to January's sales data, which point to potentially faster growth in the first three months of the year. A separate report showed inflation rose in February and is now comfortably above the Federal Reserve's target of 2 percent. The Fed is expected to announce its third rate hike in 15 months later today. "Inflation is trending gradually higher and underlying retail sales are healthy enough," said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. "Nothing here to suggest the Fed shouldn't raise interest rates at the FOMC meeting that concludes later today." Sales rose in February at furniture stores and home and garden centers. But they fell sharply at electronics and appliance stores. Sales also fell at gasoline stations, though that mostly reflects lower prices. Clothing stores, sporting goods retailers and department stores also all reported lower sales. There are several additional factors that could drive spending higher in the months ahead. Consumer confidence soared to its highest level in more than 15 years in February, according to the Conference Board, a business research group. Hiring and average hourly pay growth have picked up since the new year. Americans' finances are in better shape, with average home prices back to their pre-recession levels in much of the country. Yet the boost in confidence may not be broadly shared. That could limit any spending that might result. For Americans younger than age 35, who are less likely than older age groups to own a home or stocks, confidence actually fell last month. And the consumer confidence data has grown increasingly political in recent years, with Republicans reporting much greater optimism than Democrats. That reverses a pattern that emerged under former President Obama. Retail sales make up about one-third of total consumer spending, with the other two-thirds consisting of health care and other services. Economists closely monitor spending, because it makes up about 70 percent of the economy. Growth has yet to catch up with the recent burst of optimism that has followed Donald Trump's election. The economy expanded at a modest 1.9 percent pace in the final three months of last year. Most economists expect it will grow at roughly a 2 percent pace in the January-March quarter.

Avon Lake lawyer Jack Kilroy, president of the nonprofit Sober Seventeenth, urges a sober Cleveland celebration this year, one "fit for a saint." (Chuck Crow, The Plain Dealer, File, 2016) Print Email Guest Columnist/cleveland.com By Guest Columnist/cleveland.com The Plain Dealer on March 15, 2017 at 11:34 AM, updated March 15, 2017 at 11:35 AM comments Turning the feast day of Ireland's patron saint's into a carnival of binge drinking hurts everyone. Jack Kilroy, attorney Jack Kilroy  AVON LAKE, Ohio -- "On St. Patrick's Day, we're all Irish" is a familiar refrain every March in Greater Cleveland communities hosting big St. Patrick's Day celebrations. "The Irish are all drunks," is a common stereotype echoed every March on crudely humored T-shirts and Facebook memes. Okay, if everyone is Irish on St. Patrick's Day, and all the Irish are drunks, then everyone should be drunk on St. Patrick's Day, right? If you venture through downtown Cleveland's streets during the St. Patrick's Day parade or grace any crowded local bar with an Irish-sounding name, you'll likely conclude everyone is drunk. (Remarkably, the Irish-Americans marching in the parade are not drunk). Cleveland's St. Patrick's Day parade has a new route for 2017: See the map So what's the harm with everyone having a little fun at the expense of the Irish? It's springtime and we need an excuse to party, no? Irish-Americans have done well and haven't been hurt by the stereotype, have they? But when the stereotype mutates the feast day of Ireland's patron saint into a carnival of binge drinking, it hurts everyone. There is a human toll. According to a 2016 Ohio State Highway Patrol statement, "Due to impaired drivers, [March 17] has also become a very dangerous night on Ohio's roads. Last year, impaired drivers killed five of the six people that lost their lives during the 24-hour reporting period over St. Patrick's Day. During this same time period, the Patrol made 215 [drunken driving] arrests." Read this year's release from the Ohio State Highway Patrol Last year, cleveland.com reported that Cleveland police had developed "a revamped security strategy for [the 2016] St. Patrick's Day parade [to] quash the sort of booze-fueled violence the event has attracted." Additionally, domestic violence experts consider St. Patrick's Day "a high-risk day." The drunken stereotype fuels binge drinking, leading to drunken driving, assaults, and domestic violence. The good news is that some Irish-Americans are working to end the stereotyping and harmful consequences. In 2015, Long Island resident Kevin Westley waged a one-man campaign to buy up offensive St. Patrick's Day T-shirts at his local Walmart. On March 18, he returned them all for a refund. The Ancient Order of Hibernians took this effort to a national level, writing Walmart, "There is no room in the America of the 21st century for bigoted ethnic-based stereotypes, no matter who the target is." Locally, a small nonprofit called Sober Seventeenth Inc. hosts an alcohol-free, family-friendly St. Patrick's Day celebration featuring authentic Irish music, dance and culture. Sober Seventeenth welcomes the recovery community, as well as families with children who want to enjoy Irish culture minus a sea of alcohol. Now in its fourth year, this event features star performers from Ireland and champion Irish step dancers. At Ahern's Banquet Center in Avon Lake, Sober Seventeenth draws over 400 delighted guests and has become one of the biggest St. Patrick's Day celebrations in Northeast Ohio. Last year: Irish country-Christian singer James Kilbane tops 'Sober 17th' St. Paddy's Day bill St. Patrick was an escaped slave, a refugee, a leader who challenged a nation's superstitious belief system, and a spiritual man whose disciples dedicated themselves to helping the less fortunate. St. Patrick is worthy of celebration. Let's have celebrations that are fit for a saint! Attorney Jack Kilroy, a frequent visitor to Ireland, is president of Sober Seventeenth and a member of both the West Side Irish American Club and the Irish American Club East Side. Tickets for this year's event can be purchased here. ********* Have something to say about this topic?

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox News Politics Expand/Collapse Search Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Business Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World On Air Politics Home Executive Senate House Defense Judiciary Fox News Poll Taxes Boeing vs. Wal-Mart: Aerospace giant, retail titan divided over House tax reform plan By Andrew O'Reilly Published March 15, 2017 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 Email Print   Boeing and several other leading U.S. aerospace and defense companies voiced their support on Tuesday for House Speaker Paul Ryan’s controversial tax reform plan – a marked departure from the opposition the package has faced from some of the country’s largest retailers. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, who is also chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA), sent a letter to congressional leaders on Tuesday saying AIA backed the plan. He described it as “comprehensive reforms of our tax code.” The letter puts the AIA – a lobbying group consisting of 330 aerospace companies based in the United States – clearly in the corner of those in favor of Ryan’s tax-system reform package and it’s hotly debated “border adjustment tax,” which supporters say will fuel growth in U.S. manufacturing jobs. “This plan is going to help enable our industry to create new, higher-paying jobs and, paired with a growth in exports, will be a major boost to the economy,” Dan Stohr, the director of communications at AIA, told Fox News. “The border adjustment tax is one part of the plan that we strongly support.” Expand / Contract A Boeing 737 MAX plane is seen during a media tour of the Boeing plant in Renton, Washington, U.S. December 7, 2015. (REUTERS/Matt Mills McKnight) The letter from Muilenburg comes after Boeing – along with fellow corporations like GE, Caterpillar, Oracle and Merck - joined the “American Made Coalition” last month to lobby for tax reform changes. U.S. manufacturers are particularly in favor of the tax deductions written into the House's package. Under the plan, companies like Boeing – which invests millions into its U.S.-based assembly plants – would receive capital investment deductions along with deductions for labor and inventory costs. “We need to look at the bigger picture here and see if the upsides of this plan outweigh the downsides,” Stohr said. “Our industry believes they do.” Opponents of the tax plan, including Wal-Mart – the world’s largest company – and fellow retail giant Target, say that the move to tax all imports would not only hurt their bottom line but also cause steep price increases for consumers on items like gas, clothing and prescription medicines. “We need tax reform that rewards entrepreneurs and allows businesses to grow and create good-paying jobs that lift working families up,” David French, a senior vice president at the National Retail Federation, said in a press release. “The [border adjustment tax]  does just the opposite, penalizing Americans by adding a tax on clothing, food, gas and other necessities while threatening the very industry that 42 million hardworking men and women rely upon for their livelihoods.” The divide between the country’s manufacturers and retailers mirrors one on the halls of Congress where House and Senate Republicans seem sharply divided over key elements of the plan. GOP lawmakers in the Senate have expressed opposition to a House proposal to replace the current 35 percent tax on corporate profits with the border adjustment tax. Under the House proposal, American companies that produce and sell their products in the United States would pay a new 20 percent tax on the profits from those sales. But if the company exports its products, the profits from those exports would not be taxed by the United States. However, foreign companies that import goods into the U.S. would have to pay the 20 percent tax. Besides retailers in the U.S., the proposed border adjustment tax has also become a major concern for some of the U.S.’s biggest trade partners like China and Mexico. More on this... Trump compromise could end 'Boeing's Bank' for good Trump touts jobs at Boeing visit: 'American industry is roaring back' Private Astronaut Taxis by SpaceX, Boeing May Not Be Ready by 2019: Report During the campaign, President Trump pledged to attack America's persistent trade deficits, which he blamed for the loss of millions of good-paying factory jobs. Along with border adjustment tax in the House’s plan, Trump has threatened to slap punitive tariffs on imports from China, Mexico and other nations he has accused of trading unfairly. There is worry among economists who worry that the border adjustment tax and Trump’s tough talk could elevate the situation into all-out trade wars in which foreign nations retaliate by boosting their tariffs on American goods. “U.S. trade partners are likely to respond to the border tax adjustment by retaliating,” Desmond Lachman, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote in The Hill. “They would do so by taking similar trade measures as did the U.S. with the aim of boosting their own exports and of penalizing U.S. imports.” Despite mixed messages on the House plan early on, the White House has recently warmed up to the idea.  Bloomberg reported that top Trump strategist Steve Bannon is a major supporter of the tax reform package. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said late last month that he is working with Ryan and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, on a combined plan that would draw support from lawmakers in both the House and Senate. Mnuchin, however, did not commit to supporting the border adjustment tax but said the administration was "looking closely" at the issues raised by this type of tax. "We're working behind the scenes very carefully. We're running a lot of numbers and we're taking into account a lot of issues," he said, adding that he hopes to have a proposal ready to unveil in "the near future, and we're committed to get this passed by August." The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Puskar) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) Washington • Americans spent only slightly more last month at retail stores compared with January, a sign of consumer caution despite rising optimism about the economy. The Commerce Department said Wednesday retail sales ticked up a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent in February, after a much bigger gain of 0.6 percent the previous month. January's gain was revised higher. The figures suggest that strong job gains this year, near record-high stock prices and decent pay gains haven't yet lifted spending. But last month's sluggish pace could prove temporary. Economists note that spending was likely held back by delays in tax refund payments. A new law has required tougher scrutiny of a tax credit claimed by lower-income taxpayers. Wal-Mart said last month that the delay had slowed sales at its stores in February. Other retailers have reported similar concerns. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Yet tax refunds have started to flow this month, which could trigger a rebound.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Don’t call it a comeback — Business executives sky high — A windfall, for Clinton voters By Bernie Becker 03/15/17 10:00 AM EDT With help from Brian Faler WELL, THAT WAS UNEXPECTED: President Donald Trump’s tax returns made a big comeback late Tuesday night, with a new set of leaked documents broadcast on MSNBC showing Trump paid around a quarter of his income in taxes after earning some $150 million in 2005. Story Continued Below First things first: The first two pages of Trump’s 1040 from 2005 are hardly going to quell the demand for more of the president’s returns, especially because a lot of the more interesting information wouldn’t be on those first two pages. Still, the release of a return showing that Trump paid some $38 million in federal taxes in one year wouldn’t seem like bad news for the president, who’s been accused of overstating his wealth and whose leaked state returns from 1995 showed hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. Certainly, the Trump family wasn’t upset by the most recent news, with Donald Trump Jr. thanking MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow “for proving to your #Trump hating followers how successful @realDonaldTrump is & that he paid $40mm in taxes!” David Cay Johnston, the journalist who obtained the returns, said someone sent the documents to him and even speculated that Trump himself might have sent them. The details: Trump earned around $150 million in 2005, but also reported about a $100 million loss, putting his adjusted gross income at $48.5 million. If Trump had only faced the regular income tax system, he would’ve paid in the $5 million range in taxes. It was because of the Alternative Minimum Tax, a parallel system meant to ensure that wealthy people can’t rely too heavily on tax incentives to lower their bill, that Trump paid an extra $30 million-plus. It’s tough to say why the AMT would play such a big role without additional information from Trump’s returns — but a couple of good guesses could be that Trump might have been pushing forward past business losses or using depreciation on some of his assets. The policy ramifications: Trump and House Republicans propose scrapping the AMT, which would have been a good deal for the president over a decade ago.

BUSINESS IS READY: The Business Roundtable checks in with its chief executives every quarter about how the economy is going — and the organization’s index, examining CEO plans for expansion, just made its biggest jump since 2009. Josh Bolten, the group’s chief executive, and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan, the BRT chairman, declined to hazard a guess of just how much of that increase was due to Trump. But Bolten said there was no doubt that the excitement over the current GOP agenda was playing some sizable role, and that a potential tax overhaul was one of the issues on that agenda that really animated BRT chief executives. He then also refused to even consider the idea that the current plans for tax reform and other policy initiatives could be derailed, even with some ambitious timelines coming out of the Trump administration. “We don’t think the hopes will be dashed. There’s obviously a lot of turbulence around the health care act,” said Bolten, who served as chief of staff to former President George W. Bush. “The other elements of the agenda we think are well on track,” including taxes, he added. (Morning Tax would note there’s already quite a fight over the House GOP blueprint, even before the issue really takes center stage and other fights over tradeoffs have even begun.) “While it’s never easy to do tax reform, this is really the once in a generation opportunity,” Bolten said. We know one guy who agrees with that: House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, who also likes to talk about the generational opportunity in front of Washington, is scheduled to address the quarterly meeting of BRT chief executives at 10:15 a.m. today. Speaking of the “tax reform is hard” mantra, the Business Roundtable is pretty divided over the border adjustment in the House GOP plan. By Morning Tax’s count, a dozen BRT corporations — including Boeing, General Electric and Pfizer — are in the American Made Coalition supporting the House GOP plan. (That’s well over half the known members of the coalition.) A half-dozen, including Target, Wal-Mart and Xerox, are in the opposition Americans for Affordable Products. Get me a whip list! Freedom Partners — a conservative group with ties to the Koch brothers and big-time opponents of the House blueprint — have crafted a whip list of those opposing or concerned about border adjustability. The list includes 14 GOP senators, or more than a quarter of the conference, and a half-dozen House Republicans, most of them Ways and Means members. Also new from the anti-side: A fact-checking sheet from Americans for Affordable Products taking on Alan Auerbach, the economist most closely associated with the House’s destination-based cash flow tax. The group took special issue with Auerbach’s statement that the House plan would hurt companies that currently avoid their U.S. tax bills. And finally: The opposition to border adjustability might be growing, according to a new CNBC Fed Survey. Three out of five economists, fund managers and strategists are now against the idea, according to the survey, up from 45 percent the last time. ** A message from H&R Block Policy Perspectives: With one month to go before the filing deadline and increased discussion around a tax code overhaul, listen to H&R Block CEO Bill Cobb’s take on tax reform and its potential effects on consumers, as well as his thoughts on the future of the tax preparation industry.

And at least on the tax side, Bloomberg reports that the tax cuts for high earners under the American Health Care Act at least appear to be a better deal for Hillary Clinton voters. In fact, counties that voted for Clinton would get an annual windfall of almost $22 billion a year under the GOP health care bill, according to a Bloomberg analysis. That’s more than three times higher than the $6.6 billion a year that Trump counties would get. A good deal for everyone: For at least one senior administration official, who exactly benefits from cutting Affordable Care Act taxes wouldn’t seem to be a big deal. “Who cares if somebody else benefits? Why do you have to have a system that punishes somebody in order to help somebody else?” Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s budget chief, said on MSNBC, via our Toby Eckert. “We think we’ve created a system that saves money and allows more people to get affordable health care. Why would it be bad if folks benefit from a small tax reduction at the same time?” EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS: A new Treasury counselor for tax reform will probably give a boost to the department short on senior leadership, Bloomberg BNA reports. The counselor, Justin Muzinich, comes on at a time when the Trump administration doesn’t appear close to naming an assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy. But while having someone on board to focus on taxes could be helpful to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, at least one former department official worried that having a counselor for tax reform could crowd Treasury’s tax policy office after it’s fully staffed up. Higher up the food chain, Wall Street is pretty thrilled that another Goldman Sachs banker, Jim Donovan, got the nomination to be deputy Treasury secretary. DAILY HEALTH UPDATE: “The scathing nonpartisan analysis of Republicans’ Obamacare repeal plan is hardening GOP divisions and raising doubts about whether the party in Congress can meet a self-imposed deadline to pass legislation by early April,” POLITICO’s Burgess Everett and Rachael Bade report. INTERNATIONAL UPDATE — AN ALPS CONNECTION: Italy and Switzerland, a pair of European neighbors, have signed an agreement that will ease the flow of information between the two countries in an effort to battle tax evasion, Reuters reports. Italy’s economic ministry said the new pact would build on one from last summer and “will help Italy obtain revenues from a tax amnesty aimed at raising 1.6 billion euros ($1.70 billion) this year, following 4 billion euros cashed in through the measure in 2016,” according to Reuters. STATE NEWS — MORE CUTS FOR TEXAS: There’s a debate brewing over a proposal in the Texas Senate that would put even more handcuffs on local governments that want to raise property taxes without the OK from voters, the Texas Tribune reports. On the one hand, that’s a pretty popular idea in the Lone Star State — a recent poll found it was the top legislative priority for most voters. But localities are worried that the proposed legislation would tie their hands, and do nothing to roll back Texas’ overreliance on using property taxes to fund schools. Texas doesn’t have an income tax, and the state government can’t set local property tax rates. So what can the state do? The bill from state Sen. Paul Bettencourt, a Republican, would allow residents to seek a vote on any proposed property tax increase of at least 4 percent, down from the current 8 percent. HOW DO YOU KEEP TEACHERS? California is hoping the answer is offering them a chance to get out of paying state income taxes. A new proposal in the state Legislature would allow teachers already in place to skip their state taxes for a decade, and help new teachers pay off their certification costs. The San Francisco Chronicle reports that around 300,000 teachers would get an assist from the bill — and, given that it’s California, it’s a pretty sizable helping hand. Teachers making around $75,000 a year would escape an almost $4,000 tax bill — the equivalent of getting a 5 percent raise. QUICK LINKS — White nationalist Richard Spencer’s nonprofit loses its tax exemption. — Now that’s a headline, Bloomberg BNA: “IRS puts squeeze on ThighMaster’s tax shelter.” — The Brazilian Senate passes a new tax amnesty measure.

RUGABER AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) - Americans spent only slightly more last month at retail stores compared with January, a sign of consumer caution despite rising optimism about the economy. The Commerce Department said Wednesday retail sales ticked up a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent in February, after a much bigger gain of 0.6 percent the previous month. January's gain was revised higher. The figures suggest that strong job gains this year, near record-high stock prices and decent pay gains haven't yet lifted spending. But last month's sluggish pace could prove temporary. Economists note that spending was likely held back by delays in tax refund payments. A new law has required tougher scrutiny of a tax credit claimed by lower-income taxpayers. Wal-Mart said last month that the delay had slowed sales at its stores in February. Other retailers have reported similar concerns. Yet tax refunds have started to flow this month, which could trigger a rebound. Economists were also encouraged by the upward revisions to January's sales data, which point to potentially faster growth in the first three months of the year. A separate report showed inflation rose in February and is now comfortably above the Federal Reserve's target of 2 percent. The Fed is expected to announce its third rate hike in 15 months later today. "Inflation is trending gradually higher and underlying retail sales are healthy enough," said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. "Nothing here to suggest the Fed shouldn't raise interest rates at the FOMC meeting that concludes later today." Sales rose in February at furniture stores and home and garden centers. But they fell sharply at electronics and appliance stores. Sales also fell at gasoline stations, though that mostly reflects lower prices. Clothing stores, sporting goods retailers and department stores also all reported lower sales. There are several additional factors that could drive spending higher in the months ahead. Consumer confidence soared to its highest level in more than 15 years in February, according to the Conference Board, a business research group. Hiring and average hourly pay growth have picked up since the new year. Americans' finances are in better shape, with average home prices back to their pre-recession levels in much of the country. Yet the boost in confidence may not be broadly shared. That could limit any spending that might result. For Americans younger than age 35, who are less likely than older age groups to own a home or stocks, confidence actually fell last month. And the consumer confidence data has grown increasingly political in recent years, with Republicans reporting much greater optimism than Democrats. That reverses a pattern that emerged under former President Obama. Retail sales make up about one-third of total consumer spending, with the other two-thirds consisting of health care and other services. Economists closely monitor spending, because it makes up about 70 percent of the economy. Growth has yet to catch up with the recent burst of optimism that has followed Donald Trump's election. The economy expanded at a modest 1.9 percent pace in the final three months of last year. Most economists expect it will grow at roughly a 2 percent pace in the January-March quarter.

To seek out companies led by stemwinders, investors should ask these five questions. iStockphoto By Rob Lutts, Investment Adviser, President and Chief Investment Officer | Cabot Wealth Management March 2017 Contact Me When thinking about which companies are worth investing in, people usually look for a strong balance sheet and positive cash flow, but before delving too deeply into the company’s bottom line, they should take a moment to consider its top leader. Is there a “stemwinder” at the helm? SEE ALSO: Can You Save Too Much in Your 401(k)? What is a stemwinder? He or she is the leader of the business. It is the leader’s job to “wind the stem” of the company on a regular basis to create momentum, keeping the company moving toward its goal. The term “stemwinder” refers to the stems of wind-up toys popular years ago, before battery-powered toys. In a company, the work of winding the stem relates to goal-setting, product development, marketing, recruiting and hiring, sales, manufacturing, service and all of the other key functions of the business. The best CEO stemwinders know what the business needs and work diligently on that part of the business just when it needs it. Stemwinders do not necessarily need to be able to perform all these functions themselves or be masters at them – they just need to be able to find the best people for the job. Often a great stemwinder has the vision to see a market opportunity before others do. They have incredible energy and passion, and they often are very open to new, innovative ideas. Advertisement A great growth company has to first have a great product or service, often created or developed by the company founder or leader. But this is only the first step. A great growth company will not only have an innovative new product or service, it will also have someone who knows how to sell it. This is the downfall of many CEOs. They have a solid product or service that is truly remarkable; however, they lack the ability to figure out how to bring it to market. So, a stemwinder needs to have not only great passion for the product or service, but also the ability to introduce the product to the customer in a way that is eﬀective, eﬃcient and profitable. I have been studying some of the best stemwinder CEOs in the world and have learned a great deal about eﬀective leaders. They all have one common trait: unyielding passion to grow and nurture their businesses. I believe studying great leaders can help you to develop a better portfolio of securities. Who are some examples of stemwinders? I believe Sam Walton may go down as one of the top stemwinders of all time. His simple philosophy of how to grow a retail business was the key to his success. He had two basic beliefs — low prices and great service would make for a fine retail business. Those simple principles are still the driving force today in guiding Wal-Mart’s current management. Another stemwinder we all know is Steve Jobs, an exciting entrepreneur with design, development, marketing and financial skills. As co-founder and former CEO of Apple, he was, in essence, the complete CEO and a person driven to achieve extraordinary results. Jobs’ middle name should have been “stemwinder” — he knew no other way to live. Advertisement Apple is enjoying tremendous success. In 2010, Steve Jobs was proud to announce that the company had achieved its first $50 billion year of sales. Today, thanks to the legacy of Jobs’ steadfast commitment to perfection, the company is doing $50 billion in sales in one quarter! Obviously, we all wish we could have invested in Wal-Mart or Apple when they first went public; perhaps some investors did because they realized that Walton and Jobs had the vision to carry their respective companies to success. The stemwinder I see the most potential in right now is Elon Musk. His product, vision and leadership have the potential to propel Tesla (TSLA) to incredible success for decades to come. Other stemwinders with outstanding potential who are less known by most investors are: Jen-Hsun Huang CEO and Co Founder — Nvidia Corp (NVDA): the leader in chips for Artificial Intelligence applications. Jonathan Ayers CEO — Idexx Labs (IDXX): provides diagnostics, detection and information systems for veterinary offices all over the country and overseas. Scott Scherr CEO and Founder — Ultimate Software Group: (ULTI) provides cloud based software solutions for midsize companies to manage human resource functions, including HR, payroll, benefits management, talent management and reporting. James Herbert CEO and Founder — First Republic Bank (FRC): wealth management and private banking services for high-net-worth individuals and corporate relationships. Want to know how to spot a stemwinder? Ask yourself the following five questions: Advertisement Do they have great energy and passion for the company mission? Do they have the ability to overcome obstacles and create solutions? Do they attract and hire strong, capable talent? Do they have vision, seeing great opportunity when others see none? Do they have a record of success? Do all stemwinders succeed? Of course not; many keep trying and fail. There are many hard-charging CEOs and leaders who are trying to wind up their companies each and every day. Some of them do not seem to be able to wind up the right parts of the company, and as a result they do not achieve success. Sometimes success comes to a company because all the stars align to develop a unique growth opportunity. However, that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t seek out stemwinders. I think many investors underestimate just how important management is in a growth company. When great innovation meets excellent management, amazing things can happen and the value creation can be incalculable and unforeseeable.

Puskar In this Friday, Feb. 10, 2017, photo, a shopper passes a display in the window of a J. Crew store in the Shadyside shopping district of Pittsburgh. On Wednesday, March 15, 2017, the Commerce Department releases U.S. retail sales data for February. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans spent only slightly more last month at retail stores compared with January, a sign of consumer caution despite rising optimism about the economy. The Commerce Department said Wednesday retail sales ticked up a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent in February, after a much bigger gain of 0.6 percent the previous month. January's gain was revised higher. The figures suggest that strong job gains this year, near record-high stock prices and decent pay gains haven't yet lifted spending. But last month's sluggish pace could prove temporary. Economists note that spending was likely held back by delays in tax refund payments. A new law has required tougher scrutiny of a tax credit claimed by lower-income taxpayers. Wal-Mart said last month that the delay had slowed sales at its stores in February. Other retailers have reported similar concerns. Yet tax refunds have started to flow this month, which could trigger a rebound. Economists were also encouraged by the upward revisions to January's sales data, which point to potentially faster growth in the first three months of the year. A separate report showed inflation rose in February and is now comfortably above the Federal Reserve's target of 2 percent. The Fed is expected to announce its third rate hike in 15 months later today. "Inflation is trending gradually higher and underlying retail sales are healthy enough," said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. "Nothing here to suggest the Fed shouldn't raise interest rates at the FOMC meeting that concludes later today." Sales rose in February at furniture stores and home and garden centers. But they fell sharply at electronics and appliance stores. Sales also fell at gasoline stations, though that mostly reflects lower prices. Clothing stores, sporting goods retailers and department stores also all reported lower sales. There are several additional factors that could drive spending higher in the months ahead. Consumer confidence soared to its highest level in more than 15 years in February, according to the Conference Board, a business research group. Hiring and average hourly pay growth have picked up since the new year. Americans' finances are in better shape, with average home prices back to their pre-recession levels in much of the country. Yet the boost in confidence may not be broadly shared. That could limit any spending that might result. For Americans younger than age 35, who are less likely than older age groups to own a home or stocks, confidence actually fell last month. And the consumer confidence data has grown increasingly political in recent years, with Republicans reporting much greater optimism than Democrats. That reverses a pattern that emerged under former President Obama. Retail sales make up about one-third of total consumer spending, with the other two-thirds consisting of health care and other services. Economists closely monitor spending, because it makes up about 70 percent of the economy. Growth has yet to catch up with the recent burst of optimism that has followed Donald Trump's election. The economy expanded at a modest 1.9 percent pace in the final three months of last year. Most economists expect it will grow at roughly a 2 percent pace in the January-March quarter.

Bennett, a sophomore from Pine Bluff, was one of the original participants in a new mountain biking club at Catholic High School in Little Rock. Bob Black-Ocken Davis Bennett rounds a turn during a race. Bennett, a sophomore from Pine Bluff, was one of the original participants in a new mountain biking club at Catholic High School in Little Rock. Davis Bennett is a man of few words. Asked what piqued his interest in the Catholic High mountain bike club, the sophomore cuts right to the chase. “They just mentioned it over the announcements at school,” he said. “I’ve always loved mountain biking, and I was like, ‘Sounds fun, I want to do it.’” Bennett had ridden recreationally for a long time, but never raced. In fact, he admitted he wasn’t much of a joiner at all throughout his freshman year, saying none of the various activities appealed to him. That all changed when the bike team was announced last fall. “(Cycling) was a lot harder than I expected,” he said. “I figured out I wasn’t in the best shape, and I needed to do a lot more work to get into better shape. But it was really fun. All the guys out there are really nice, and it’s a great experience. There’s a lot of really great people.” Bob Black-Ocken, Bennett’s coach, parent of a CHS freshman and a member of Our Lady of the Holy Souls Church in Little Rock, is in many ways his polar opposite. Gregarious and with 25 years of competitive cycling under his belt, Black-Ocken is as dyed-in-the-wool in the sport as Bennett and the handful of Rockets riders that came out for the club’s inaugural season are green.   “The thing that really drew me was focusing on kids that fall in the gaps between team sports,” Black-Ocken said. “More or less, we’re trying to engage them in an activity that’s outdoors, recreational and fun. Arkansas is perfect for this kind of activity.” The club is a program of the National Interscholastic Cycling Association, an organization that develops groups and provides structure and governance for youth mountain bike events. NICA clubs are forming all over the country, Black-Ocken said, including in northwest Arkansas where Tom Walton of Wal-Mart is a cycling enthusiast and the Walton Family Foundation is a prime benefactor of youth cycling initiatives. “My interest in being associated with this was, number one, the safety and fun aspect of the program is very important and the whole idea of being inclusive, not exclusive,” Black-Ocken said. “It’s just that open-minded-let’s-go-have-fun-everybody’s-included mentality or vision that really attracted me.” After attending a NICA coaching clinic, Black-Ocken sold the idea of a club to Catholic High Principal Steve Straessle, along with plans to develop a training run on the school grounds for next season. He said the value of the activity is that it reaches boys who, like Bennett, aren’t typically involved in other school or club sports. “It’s basically a structured, three-month long clinic, training and racing season. It’s very, very quick,” Black-Ocken said. “Even though it’s in the fall during football, it doesn’t conflict so much because most of the kids that are mountain biking aren’t playing football.” For a kid like Bennett, the NICA environment is an ideal fit and the benefits go well beyond racing. A native of Pine Bluff where he and his family attend St. Joseph Church, Bennett lives with his grandparents during the week in order to attend Catholic High. Adjusting to a large high school in a new community wasn’t easy, and Bennett shied away from many activities as a result. But cycling struck a chord with the 16-year-old, so much so he was the only club member to enter actual competition, racing twice. “I didn’t do too well,” he said. “The first race there was a bike malfunction, and the second I wasn’t ready for such a long race.” Yet instead of being discouraged, Bennett is enthused about improving for next season. More importantly, the activity has given him the confidence to try new things. He’s already mulling over giving the track team a try, if for no other reason to keep his conditioning up for cycling. “I learned that I need to be more involved in the outside world and do more stuff with other people,” he said. “It’s fun to hang out with all those nice people and meet new people and talk to them and try new things. Being out there and just doing all those races, win or lose, it was just really, really fun. I’m glad I did it.” Click for the Good Sports index  View the discussion thread.

(Photo: Gene J. Puskar / AP) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Washington — Americans spent only slightly more last month at retail stores compared with January, a sign of consumer caution despite rising optimism about the economy. The Commerce Department said Wednesday retail sales ticked up a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent in February, after a much bigger gain of 0.6 percent the previous month. January’s gain was revised higher. The figures suggest that strong job gains this year, near record-high stock prices and decent pay gains haven’t yet lifted spending. But last month’s sluggish pace could prove temporary. Economists note that spending was likely held back by delays in tax refund payments. A new law has required tougher scrutiny of a tax credit claimed by lower-income taxpayers. Wal-Mart said last month that the delay had slowed sales at its stores in February. Other retailers have reported similar concerns. Yet tax refunds have started to flow this month, which could trigger a rebound. Economists were also encouraged by the upward revisions to January’s sales data, which point to potentially faster growth in the first three months of the year. A separate report showed inflation rose in February and is now comfortably above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2 percent. The Fed is expected to announce its third rate hike in 15 months later today. “Inflation is trending gradually higher and underlying retail sales are healthy enough,” said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. “Nothing here to suggest the Fed shouldn’t raise interest rates at the FOMC meeting that concludes later today.” Sales rose in February at furniture stores and home and garden centers. But they fell sharply at electronics and appliance stores. Sales also fell at gasoline stations, though that mostly reflects lower prices. Clothing stores, sporting goods retailers and department stores also all reported lower sales. There are several additional factors that could drive spending higher in the months ahead. Consumer confidence soared to its highest level in more than 15 years in February, according to the Conference Board, a business research group. Hiring and average hourly pay growth have picked up since the new year. Americans’ finances are in better shape, with average home prices back to their pre-recession levels in much of the country. Yet the boost in confidence may not be broadly shared. That could limit any spending that might result. For Americans younger than age 35, who are less likely than older age groups to own a home or stocks, confidence actually fell last month. And the consumer confidence data has grown increasingly political in recent years, with Republicans reporting much greater optimism than Democrats. That reverses a pattern that emerged under former President Obama. Retail sales make up about one-third of total consumer spending, with the other two-thirds consisting of health care and other services. Economists closely monitor spending, because it makes up about 70 percent of the economy. Growth has yet to catch up with the recent burst of optimism that has followed Donald Trump’s election. The economy expanded at a modest 1.9 percent pace in the final three months of last year. Most economists expect it will grow at roughly a 2 percent pace in the January-March quarter.

Sundeep Khanna Volkswagen has announced an initial agreement with Indian market laggard Tata Motors. Photo: Bloomberg New Delhi: Recent moves in the global automobile industry show how important the India business has been for multinational companies like Suzuki Motor Co. and what an edge their sustained success in the country has given them outside India as well. Toyota Motor Co.’s recent interest in Suzuki culminating in the announcement of a business partnership is premised on the smaller company’s 47% market share in the world’s fastest growing market for automobiles. Similarly, Volkswagen AG, under pressure following the emissions scandal that has already cost it a CEO and considerable loss of reputation, has announced an initial agreement with Indian market laggard Tata Motors. In its sights is the potentially promising domestic market which it has been unable to crack on its own. It isn’t as if India hasn’t been on the radar of Toyota and Volkswagen earlier. Both have had businesses here for over a decade now, with varying degrees of success. But with projections suggesting the Indian market is red-hot ready for growth, neither of these two global heavyweights find themselves positioned to push for leadership. Hence, the belated moves to look for another route. Unfortunately, the window of opportunity in India is beginning to close. Already in sectors like telecom, conventional automobiles, information technology and white goods, the scope for a new company to make a mark in India is limited. The early players are now entrenched incumbents. For every Suzuki, Nestlé SA, Unilever and Siemens that figured years ago that India could be the jewel in its global business, there’s been a string of multinationals that kept waiting for the right timing and didn’t show up until it was too late or if they did come in, they aborted their ventures in India way too early. French car-maker Peugeot, which recently acquired General Motors’ loss-making European brands Opel and Vauxhal, was an early entrant to India’s newly liberalized car sector. But in 1997, Peugeot, which was making 306 sedans in India, decided to stop producing cars and sold its Indian stake to partner Premier Automobiles. A fraction of the £1.9 billion it is spending on the latest acquisition may have won it bragging rights in India. For inspiration it could have checked the record of The Coca Cola Company following its re-entry into the country. The $60 million the beverage company paid in 1993 to buy Parle Exports’s best selling brands like Thums Up and Limca may well have been its smartest investment in India, killing off its strongest local competitor and also adding a strong local brand to its portfolio. Today Thums Up lords over the Indian market for colas. Late-comers to the Indian market have also included six-pack companies like Apple Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. For over 15 years, ever since it embarked on a strategy of going global in 1991, Wal-Mart chose to ignore India, intimidated perhaps by the politics surrounding organized retail in the country. Instead of working with the government to shape policy and its own strategy in the firm belief that one of the world’s youngest populations would also one day become the fastest growing consuming segment, it waited until 2007 to open its first store in the country. With growth prospects in the US quite limited, it has now spent the last 10 years trying to forge a meaningful partnership at a time when the market for organized retail in India is booming. Its six-year-old venture with Bharti Enterprises was dissolved in 2013 with the result that it has little to show for its 10-year sojourn in the country. Reams have been written about how Apple ignored India for most of the last 14 years before getting serious over the last two years. Given Indians’ appetite for iPhones, 2.5 million of which have been sold here, that should count as a significant opportunity loss. By 1984-85, Apple already had as many as five distributors in India before it appointed Raba Contel in 1985 as its sole distributor. Despite the early start, Apple never really focused on India and will probably need to invest heavily to make a significant dent now. The sheer size of the market in India, the potential upside in terms of growth as well as the opportunities to experiment that the diversity of consumer experiences present, lend heft to any multinational company’s global operations. But the time to get in is now. Otherwise it may well be too late.

Kristian Rouz – A residential mortgage bubble kick-started the Great Recession back in 2007 with enormous levels of indebtedness having turned into non-performing loans (NPLs), and the resulting wave of foreclosures dragging the entire economy to the bottom of contraction. While this time around the US economy seems to be more resilient, the decline of the shopping mall concept could deal a massive blow to the banking sector yet again: many commercial properties are failing to achieve the performance levels of their glory days, and overleveraged property owners are seeking ways out. © Flickr/ Mike Mozart Trump's Jobs Creation Agenda Gains Traction on GM, Walmart AnnouncementsIn the 1990s, the shopping mall used to be not only a major local retail hub, but also the ultimate meeting spot, providing customers with entertainment, food and beverages, and lots of space to hang out. With the recent advent of e-commerce, many consumers switched to online shopping, while improvements to in-home entertainment, primarily services such as Netflix, have severely decimated the public’s eagerness to leave their dollars at the mall. The shopping mall has therefore become an almost redundant concept, and the entailing decline and abandonment of brick-and-mortar retail has spurred multiple mall defaults across the US. Meanwhile, most investors are either betting against or actually selling commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), since indebted malls, unable to generate sufficient revenues, are becoming a toxic asset. Youtube / Sputnik Black Friday Mayhem at Dallas WalmartSuburban America, sprawling for dozens of square miles around city centres in most US metropolitan areas, is losing interest in brick-and-mortar retail not only because of the success of the likes of eBay and Amazon and convenient home delivery services with multiple returns and exchange options, but also because the all-American culture of consumption is wearing down. Since the start of 2017, over 1,500 retail outlets have closed across many shopping mall locations, including such stores as Abercrombie & Fitch, American Apparel, Sears, Macy’s and JCPenney. The reason being, people are not coming out to the mall to buy anything at all. Whilst the chain store retailers are closing outlets in order to minimize their expenses, the shopping malls that used to host their outlets are facing the grim reality of impending collapse. “Lower productivity centres are increasingly at risk of obsolescence,” analysts of real estate research company Green Street Advisors reported. “The top 300-400 malls by quality should fare well for the next several years, but it is reasonable to assume that several hundred lower quality malls will either close or become irrelevant retail destinations over the next 10 years.” US malls are divided into four categories based on their performance and leverage: the ‘A’ and ‘B’ level malls boast higher sales productivity and are typically low-leveraged, whilst the ‘C’ and ‘D’ category malls, which represent some 30pc of all US shopping centres, are struggling with low occupancy rates, declining customer traffic, and dismal sales productivity. The US has roughly 1,070 malls, and whilst 310 of these are ‘A’-level malls, another 334 fall into the categories of ‘C’ and ‘D’ malls. The main issue, however, is not that the people are buying less and do not go to the mall on a date or a night out with their mates. The greatest challenge is debt – many struggling malls are dangerously high-leveraged. “Loss severities on mall loans have been meaningfully higher than other areas,” Michael Yannell of Gapstow Capital Partners said. © Flickr/ Mike Mozart Walmart Might Buy Amazon Rival Jet.com for $3BlnThe total size of the US CMBS market is $365 bln, and mall-related debt securities are just a small fraction of it, which means an across-the-board crisis will hardly hit the economy very soon if the malls continue closing down (and they will). The problem is, however, dismal mall performance might affect other commercial properties, as developers will be facing greater difficulties obtaining financing for their projects, because viability concerns are rife in slowing consumer markets. From the beginning of this year, $985 mln worth of the riskiest types of CMBS were purchased, which is five times that in the 4Q16, according to data by Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. Buyers of such contracts win when shopping malls default on their obligations, as mall owners have to pay monthly premiums to holders of such securities. Banks and other lenders typically hold these contracts, but the skyrocketing transaction amounts mean that, first, banks are anticipating more mall collapses, and, second, they are eager to steer away from anything mall-related. “These malls are dying, and we see very limited prospect of a turnaround in performance,” Alder Hill Management said in their January report. “We expect 2017 to be a tipping point.” What could possibly save a mall on the verge of a collapse is a remodelling of the commercial property to serve other purposes than simply hosting retail outlets. American suburbia is oversaturated with consumer goods, but is lacking proper real-life entertainment experiences, as the faceless reality of endless residential neighbourhoods is hardly deemed amusing. Yet, amidst the current trends, most malls are still bound to collapse as financing of ‘C’ and ‘D’ category malls would hardly be possible to obtain given the rising US Fed interest rates and the CMBS market anxiety. Subsequently, mall debts, sold and resold, might easily turn into NPLs, and even the sale of the bankrupt properties might not be enough to cover their debt. The death of the mall, however, will likely be only enough to rock the boat of the commercial property market, but it takes greater volume of NPLs to capsize it and bring on the next recession. ...

It certainly doesn't need to involve President Trump's impeachment and removal from office. Rather, imagine this: As the 2018 midterm elections approach, Trump's only accomplishment is starting construction on the southern border mega-wall. No ObamaCare replacement. No big tax cut. No big infrastructure plan. And millions of American voters are starting to consider that handing total power in Washington to a party led by a short-attention-span novice was a cosmically bad idea. It hardly seems like a far-fetched scenario right now. First, repealing and replacing ObamaCare, the GOP's top priority, was just dealt a hammer blow by the Congressional Budget Office. Conservative Republicans will surely focus on the CBO finding that the American Health Care Act would reduce projected debt by $300 billion and cut taxes by $900 billion over a decade. But the more relevant numbers to many Americans will be the 14 million people losing health insurance coverage next year and the 20 percent rise in insurance premiums if the bill becomes law. Republicans may quibble about details and degree, but the CBO forecast is almost certainly correct directionally. Priority two doesn't look a whole lot healthier. The GOP plan to deeply cut tax rates depends on the blueprint's controversial and deeply confusing border-adjustment provision, where imports would be taxed but exports wouldn't. Not surprisingly, the plan has split GOP business backers depending on whether they export goods (like Boeing) or import them (like Walmart). Dropping this provision — as seems highly probable — would blow a trillion-dollar revenue hole in a plan already counting on aggressive growth forecasts to avoid hemorrhaging red ink. And while it's true that things typically look darkest before the dawn when trying to pass major legislation, the AHCA and the GOP's tax plan both look to be in serious trouble. Now, to be positive, they are also more or less fixable — at least on paper. Or at least vastly improvable. The health-care plan could be tweaked to help the poor and old by spending more on Medicaid and tax credits for purchasing private insurance. And the penalty for skipping coverage could be made harsher so more healthy people sign up and create stronger risk pools. (My AEI colleagues Jim Capretta and Joe Antos have already assembled a fix.) The tax plan could also be modified for the better. One option would be to dump the current plan and go with a ready-made alternative like the one proposed in 2014 by former GOP Ways and Means chairman Dave Camp. That proposal would cut personal and business taxes but be revenue neutral by cutting or crimping various tax breaks. Or Republicans could keep their current plan and just not cut rates so deeply, especially for wealthier Americans. Trust me, they'll be fine. Of course, the catch with all those possible changes to the health and tax plans is that while they might make them more palatable and passable to more moderate GOPers, particularly in the Senate, they would also make them less so to conservatives. Then there's the president himself, who remains a cipher on the health and tax plans he would prefer and be willing to spend political capital on. Republicans don't just need Trump to sign what they send him. They will at some point need him to show leadership on this legislation and then fight hard for it. And time is wasting away. It's always easier to try and do big things in the first year or so of a new presidential term. The 1981 Reagan tax cuts were passed and signed in August 1981. ObamaCare in March of 2010. But it's not just the electoral clock making time of the essence for the GOP. Many congressional Republicans remain worried the Trump administration will eventually implode, and they want to make sure they get the big things done ASAP.

Vietnam? Bangladesh? Mexico? Or America? She was a big believer in the “Made in the USA” movement long before President Trump started telling the nation to “Buy American and hire American.” In 2012, Paraggio launched a male swimsuit brand called NoNetz. It makes swimsuits that prevent chafing and rashes. Paraggio vowed to make the suits in the U.S. She found a textile factory in Brooklyn, MCM Enterprise, that could do the work. There was just one problem: The suit cost $23 to make in Brooklyn. Making it in China and shipping it to Paraggio’s office cost a mere $10. Manufacturing in America “makes me look like a bad business person,” Paraggio told CNNMoney. She went with the Brooklyn option anyway. Surely, she thought, customers would prefer to see the “Made in the USA” label. That’s not what happened. “No one cares about Made in the USA,” says Praggio, who recently ordered some suits from China for the first time after Daymond John of Shark Tank gave her frank advice to get real about the bottom line. So she placed the order. And cried. Trump preaches “Buy American” often. He mentioned it in his Inaugural Address. He brought it up in his first prime-time speech to Congress (watched by over 47 million people). He made it a campaign issue. But the largest obstacle to Trump’s vision may be the American shopper, who is constantly on the lookout for a good deal. Americans care most about price In survey after survey, Americans say they prefer to buy “Made in the USA” products. But when it comes to actually spending, their choices tell a different story. “Consumers are all for Made in America until they have to pay for it,” says Greg Portell, partner at consulting firm A.T. Kearney who specializing in advising retailers. People have grown accustomed to cheap prices after years of shopping at discount retailers like Walmart and Target. In general, they only buy American if it doesn’t cost much more than the product from China or Germany or Bangladesh. Paraggio saw this trend first-hand in her business. She gets two frequent comments from customers: They love the product, but why does it cost so much? An Associated Press-GFK poll last year found nearly 75% want to buy American. But their first preference is to buy the cheaper item. The Boston Consulting Group, which has studied the issue for years, found it’s a bit more complicated. When people go to the store, they also consider quality. Eighty-five percent of U.S. consumers think American-made products are better quality than those made overseas, BCG found. And they are willing to pay a premium for some products that are Made in the USA. For baby formula they’ll pay a lot more. For shoes, they won’t. “Clothing is one of the things that is very hard to reshore. It’s a tough road to go,” says Hal Sirkin, a senior partner at BCG. Overall, BCG estimates companies can charge up to about 5% more for American-made. Businesses react to the bottom line Trump certainly understands this labor math. Some of his own clothing line is made in China. Chung Yu owns the factory in Brooklyn where Paraggio has been manufacturing the NoNetz swimsuits. He’s been in garment-making for 35 years, but he’s worried about staying in business at a time when New York has raised the minimum wage. It New York City, employers who have a staff of 11 or more, have to pay $11 an hour. That will go up to $15 an hour by the end of 2018. “In China, it’s $2 or $3 an hour. And even China is getting too expensive. Retailers are switching to countries like Bangladesh,” Yu explains. Yu’s factory is still pretty busy, but it’s almost all small orders of about 300 items or less. Most of his clients are small businesses like NoNetz. As soon as they hit a certain scale, they typically jump overseas for production. “People think Made in America is better quality, but that’s not true,” Yu says, frankly. “It all depends on the quality of the machines and labor.” Yu won’t say who he voted for, but he says thanks to Trump, everyone in his world is talking about “American made” again. “When we hear how Trump will bring manufacturing back, we’re excited,” Yu told CNNMoney. “But we have to see how he will implement it.” What could come back to the U.S. There’s a lot of debate about whether Trump can bring manufacturing, let alone manufacturing jobs, back to the United States. Robots and automation have also taken some (if not a large part — Ball State University says 88% of manufacturing job losses come from automation) of the jobs. Experts say it’s going to take more than a “buy American” promotional campaign to make it to happen. The research BCG has done suggests that some industries are more ripe to come back to the U.S. than others. The reality is wages have been rising in China and elsewhere in the world, making it less attractive to make certain products there. “Computers and appliances are at a tipping point,” Sirkin says. “We’ve seen manufacturing costs overseas go up for those industries.” Clothing, however, is one of the least likely processes to return, BCG found. “How could you possibly buy shorts for $5 and have it made here. You absolutely can’t. I’ve tried,” laments Paraggio.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) (Photo: Scott Olson, 2009 Getty Images) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST The owners of Neiman Marcus are weighing whether to sell the famed department store chain as it struggles in an era of declining visits by shoppers -- and one potential buyer has already signaled its interest. Neiman Marcus Group said in a statement that it is “undertaking a process to explore and evaluate potential strategic alternatives, which include the sale of the company or other assets.’’ The announcement came as the retail company reported a loss of $117.1 million in the quarter that ended Jan. 28, as compared to the $7.8 million profit the company eked out during the same three-month period a year earlier. Neiman is among retail's most iconic department stores which are struggling to survive at a time when a growing number of consumers are choosing the ease of shopping online with Amazon, or gravitating toward the discounts and all-in-one shopping experience available at big box giants like Walmart. Sears announced in January that it would close 150 stores and sell its Craftsman tool brand, while Macy's closed 66 locations in its last fiscal year and is planning to close another 34 stores. In the case of Neiman Marcus, a potential suitor has already appeared. Canadian retailer Hudson's Bay which had reportedly been considering a merger with Macy's, is now interested in acquiring Neiman Marcus instead, according to CNBC, citing sources who spoke to Dow Jones. Hudson's Bay had been trying to secure funding to potentially purchase Macy's according to previous reports. But investors were hesitant about a deal that would anchor them in shopping malls which are seeing declining shopper visits. Now, Hudson's Bay is reportedly turning its attention to Neiman Marcus, which it would like to buy if it can find a way to deal with the chain's nearly $5 billion in debt, according to the CNBC report. A company spokesperson for Hudson's Bay said that the retailer does not comment on rumors or speculation, but "generally speaking, as we have previously stated,  we selectively evaluate opportunities to accelerate the company’s strategic growth while maintaining or enhancing its credit profile.'' Neiman Marcus, which was purchased in 2013 by Ares Management and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, planned an initial public offering in 2015 that would have helped to reduce the debt, according to Reorg Research. But in January, Neiman's owners formally withdrew their bid to go public, Reorg Research says.

In a letter Tuesday to congressional leaders, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg, who is chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association, or AIA, this year, expressed the group’s strong support for measures it described as “comprehensive reforms of our tax code.” That puts all 330 companies in the aerospace lobbying group firmly on the side of what’s called the border adjustment tax, which they say will stimulate U.S. manufacturing jobs. The tax-system reform package is hugely controversial and opposed in particular by large retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target, which say it will cause steep price increases for consumers. Muilenburg — along with the CEOs of other major corporations including GE, Caterpillar, United Technologies, Raytheon, Oracle and Merck — had already last month joined the American Made Coalition that is lobbying for the change. In a separate statement, AIA Chief Executive David Melcher described the current U.S. tax system as “broken” and not globally competitive. “We need a modern tax system which creates a level playing field with the rest of the world in order to locate and grow jobs, manufacturing and profits inside the United States,” Melcher said. The plan, proposed by House Speaker Paul Ryan and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Kevin Brady, represents a structural shift from taxing bottom-line corporate profits to taxing companies through their cash flow. If the Ryan plan becomes law, every time an item is sold in the U.S., the sales revenue would be taxable at 20 percent, with deductions allowed for labor and inventory costs. Another boost to business is that capital investment — such as the billions of dollars Boeing invests in its assembly plants — would be immediately deductible in the year the money is spent, instead of being accounted for through depreciation over many years. The most controversial piece of the proposal is the “border adjustment” element, which would exempt U.S. exports from the tax entirely, while imports would be taxed at 20 percent. President Donald Trump was initially cool to the plan but recently seems to have come around to the idea. “I certainly support a form of tax on the border, because everybody else does,” Mr. Trump told Reuters last month. Bloomberg News reported that top Trump strategist Steve Bannon is an enthusiastic backer, citing a person familiar with discussions between Bannon and Ryan. A company like Boeing, a huge net exporter, is likely to come out well ahead. The impact on other companies will vary according to how much they import. How other countries might react to the tax on imports is uncertain. Proponents of the new system insist it won’t distort the trade balance. But some experts are skeptical and believe U.S. trading partners, including perhaps China, could impose retaliatory tariffs — potentially even triggering a destructive trade war. Nonetheless, the AIA leadership, in its letter, urges Congress “to act now.” Filed under: Airplane, Boeing, Republican, Tax Print Email Gmail Related Boeing CEO Sees “Near Term” Plane Deal After Trump Meeting Trump Denies Air Force One Threat Is Retaliation for Boeing CEO’s Comments Boeing Says Dennis Muilenburg Will Become CEO on July 1 Boeing Boosts Stock-Buyback Plan By $10 Billion Boeing Nears Deal to Sell Jetliners to Iran More in Business Asian Share Markets Gain, U.S. Dollar Weaker After Fed Hike Business Briefs – March 15, 2017 Stocks Climb, Led by Energy Companies and Dividend Payers Fed Hikes Key Rate for Second Time in 3 Months Ahead of Fed Announcement, Stocks Climb, Led By Gains in Energy Companies OP-ED The Intelligence Committee’s Hearing On Russia Won’t Satisfy Democrats A Head Start on Discrimination Antidote to Amalek More Can Be Done for Missing IDF Soldiers Mitzvos and “Making It” More Than a Buzz Cellphone Withdrawal Down the Conspiracy Rabbit Hole Laziness isn’t why People are Poor, iPhones Aren’t why they Lack Health Care.

Trump spoke in his first speech to a joint session of Congress. Despite the negative reputation Trump carried from his past, his speech to Congress seemed to change the tune of his public speaking skills and his presidency as a whole. “I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength,” Trump said. “A message that is deeply delivered from my heart.” Trump began the speech in regards to Black History Month and civil liberty. From that point forward, he discussed his ideal nation: a place bonded together, standing against injustice. Trump spent the majority of his speech focused on American renewal within his Presidency. Weaved into this message, he broadly discussed practical issues within the nation. One major reoccurring theme throughout the President’s speech was the creation of new jobs. “Since my election,” President Trump said. “Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.” He also mentioned how the constructions of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines and the use of American-made steel would generate jobs within the country. President Trump noted the large impact that improving business conditions in America would have on the economy and American workers. “Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world,” Trump said. “My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.” President Trump also mentioned reforming the system of legal immigration, which he noted could impact job availability as well. “The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers,” Trump said. “Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others — have a merit-based immigration system. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.” According to President Trump, discontinuing the current system of immigration in the U.S. and switching to the merit-based system could save countless dollars, raise workers’ wages and help struggling families enter the middle class. President Trump mentioned other methods of creating jobs, as well as “draining the swamp,” defeating ISIS, repealing Obamacare and engaging in a new system of “fair trade.” “As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS — a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs,” Trump said. “We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.” President Trump also urged members of both parties to pass an education bill that would fund school choice for disadvantaged youth and allow them to attend their school of choice. Trump spoke about about supporting police and sheriffs within our local communities as well as the victims of crimes. “I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. The office is called VOICE — Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests,” he said. President Trump also mentioned sending Congress a new budget that “rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history” as well as the American foreign policy. “We will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations,” he said. “Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people — and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America. But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict — not more.” While President Trump did not go into great detail, he used his new plans as a symbol of renewal in order to motivate the American Congress. “I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country,” Trump said. “And I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and believe in yourselves. Believe in your future. And believe, once more, in America.” Overall, Trump’s speech received good reviews. Journalist and founder of Citizen University, Eric Liu, discussed his opinion of Trump’s speech with CNN. “This speech was his most effective moment as president,” Liu said. “It played to his natural strengths — performance and theatricality — while keeping his liabilities, like cynical incuriosity and casual cruelty, at bay.” However, others were displeased with the topics discussed in the speech itself. Within his speech, the President seemed to have disregarded planned details for the future. Jen Pskai, journalist and former White House Director of Communications, expressed her opinions on Trump’s speech. “The goal of such an address is to give marching orders for the months ahead,” Psaki said. “But Trump failed to lay out a specific path to achieve his policy objectives.” Throughout the evening, Trump used a poetic, generic tone. This style may be beneficial for the Trump administration to keep the peace and focus away from President Trump’s controversial Executive Orders. Trump’s first Executive Order, announced in late January, suspended entry for citizens of seven Muslim majority countries into the United States during 90 days. This order was denied by a three-judge panel who deemed that the ban did not advance national security. According to the New York Times, the panel declared that there is “‘no evidence’ which showed that anyone from the seven nations — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — had committed terrorist acts in the United States.” After the negativity and anger that sprouted from this order, the Trump administration decided to wait before taking action again. At the end of Trump’s speech, Daily Mail Political Editor, David Martosko tweeted, “A senior admin. official says the ‘revised’ travel ban order will be signed later in the week. They don’t want to step on tonight’s big win.” Although Trump has not held the highest of reputations, joint-congressional speech in his joint-congressional message placed him in a new light. “From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears,” Trump said. “Inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past, and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.” Sharing Twitter0 Facebook0 Google +0 Linkedin0 Email this article Print this article Authors Katrina Williams The Clause News President Trump addresses Congress for the first time Site index Clause Mission Statement The Clause is a student publication dedicated to providing a realistic educational experience for students of Azusa Pacific University; to seeking truth and reporting it boldly, fairly, and accurately; to enhancing the University community by providing a student voice imbued with truth, responsibility and accountability.

The trial of Christopher Whetstone, 48, began Tuesday. He is charged with the murder of Rachel Taylor, 22, who died of two gunshot wounds to her chest and stomach Jan. 13, 2014, after being found on the 500 block of Charles Street on Aurora's west side. If convicted of murder, Whetstone faces a prison term of 20 to 60 years, plus another 25-year add-on if jurors determine that he fired the shots that killed Taylor. Whetstone and Taylor had two children, ages 5 and 20 months when she was killed. They had lived with each other for nearly a year before Taylor moved out in fall 2013 to live with her mother in West Chicago, according to court testimony. Authorities said Taylor, a part-time worker at the Batavia Wal-Mart, was shot after a domestic dispute. Kane County Assistant State's Attorney Alex Bederka told jurors in his opening statement that Taylor was found shot three houses down from Whetstone's home. Witnesses say they saw Whetstone running from the scene, and police recovered spent .22 caliber shell casings near her body and inside her white Dodge Durango, which she had purchased earlier that day. Tests showed the presence of gunshot residue on Whetstone's hands after he was caught by police, Bederka said. Whetstone even asked an officer for a cigarette, saying it was going to be the last one he would have while free, Bederka added. "Christopher Whetstone shot Rachel Taylor for the worst reason of all," Bederka said. "Because he wanted to." But Assistant Public Defender Jackie Leder said Taylor was gunned down in a drive-by shooting. "That's how Rachel Taylor became a tragic victim on Jan. 13, 2014. It was a chaotic night in Aurora," Leder told jurors, noting how police had responded to a murder at a restaurant earlier that night. Whetstone ran away from the scene because he wanted to draw gunfire away from Taylor's Dodge Durango, where their children were buckled up in the back seat, Leder said. She said there were no eyewitnesses of the shooting, noted that police did not recover a gun and only focused on Whetstone as a suspect, and added that the initial 911 call from the shooting said a suspect vehicle was a black Nissan.

Ted S. Warren / AP Share Adjust Comment Print There will be a push by ride-hailing companies like Uber to get a pool of drivers signed up now that the provincial Liberal government has set a target of December for bringing their services to B.C. There are some telling examples of what drivers in other cities have faced as would-be drivers in B.C. try to figure out what wages and conditions Uber will offer here. Uber Canada says the number of drivers in B.C. who might be interested in working with them is in the tens of thousands, based on information sessions it has run over the last year in Kelowna, Victoria, Vancouver and Surrey. In Houston, meanwhile, there are drivers commuting several few hours to Austin so they can avoid working with Uber. Instead, they are opting to drive for smaller, ride-hailing companies that leave them with $100 or even $200 more at the end of each day than they would get with Uber, according to CNNMoney last week. Related B.C. to create new auto insurance for ride-hailing companies, taxi industry B.C. tech firms ready to vie with Uber for ride-hailing business Cab drivers balk at B.C. Liberal government welcoming the likes of Uber Uber and Lyft, another large ride-hailing company, decided to leave the Austin market last May because city officials there wanted their drivers to be fingerprinted. Their departure led to the flourishing of new and local apps such as Ride Austin and Fasten. In Houston, Uber drivers get 87 cents a mile, a figure that has dropped in recent years, said CNNMoney, which profiled one woman who got into financial trouble when Uber lowered its prices and changed its commission split. She eventually discovered that making the three hour trek from Houston to Austin was worth the trouble of sleeping in her car, which she would park “in an Austin Wal-Mart or apartment complex” every night from Thursday to Sunday. She now splits an apartment in Houston with three other drivers who also travel to Austin because they can earn more there than driving for Uber in Houston.  It’s typical for a company like Uber to court drivers with generous rates until it is the dominant player, said Sumeet Gulati, a UBC professor of environmental and resource economics, who has researched these ride-hailing companies.  After that, however, he worries that wages for drivers can fall to the point where they might not earn minimum wage. Doing informal research, Gulati talked to some drivers in Atlanta making as little as US$10 an hour during off-peak hours, and they had yet to account for expenses such as insurance and wear-and-tear on their car. He spoke to one woman who “lived in a nice neighbourhood and had a decent job and was trying to make some extra money to see a game” as well as a “programmer for Apple who was driving on his day off.” Said Gulati of the potential pressure on wages: “There is a lot of underused capital in North American cities. People have cars and have time.” At one point, Gulati paid an Uber driver in Atlanta a mere “$3 for a 40-minute ride. It was off-peak, but I started questioning if wages will fall to the point where people will stop driving or unionize.” In Seattle, Uber is suing the city after it approved a law that allows drivers for Uber and Lyft to unionize and collectively bargain for better working conditions, earnings and other benefits. Uber Canada official Susie Heath cited research by Princeton University professor Alan Krueger, who looked at the labour market for Uber drivers at the end of 2016, finding that hourly earnings (before expenses) remained stable even as prices fell and that hourly earnings aren’t related to how many hours a person drives per week. jlee-young@postmedia.com CLICK HERE to report a typo.

Penney Stock a Buy? The turnaround has ground to a halt, and the department store's strategy is a long shot. Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Mar 14, 2017 at 6:33PM Department store chain J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP) has successfully pulled itself back from the brink over the past few years. Sales are still seriously depressed, but the company expects to produce a meaningful adjusted profit this year, ending a long streak of losses. Gross margin has largely recovered, and operating costs have been slashed. Despite this progress, J.C. Penney hit a wall during the fourth quarter of 2016. Comparable sales slumped 0.7%, a disaster for a company that needs to grow sales at a brisk pace in order to have any chance at making a full recovery. This marked the second consecutive quarter of declining revenue, prompting investors to sell off the stock. With shares of J.C. Penney now trading for around $6, close to a 37-year low, investors looking for bargains are no doubt eyeing the beleaguered department store. J.C. Penney is now worth just $1.85 billion despite annual revenue of about $12.5 billion. But the risks outweigh the potential rewards, making the stock one to avoid. JCP data by YCharts The fundamental problem with J.C. Penney Department stores are not faring well, and that's not just a recent development. 2016 marked the 11th consecutive year of sales declines, a streak that doesn't look like it will let up anytime soon. Pressure from discounters like Wal-Mart and Target, specialty apparel chains, and online retailers like Amazon is taking a toll. This pressure is only going to intensify as more retail sales shift online. Brick-and-mortar retailers are going to need to become more aggressive to get customers into their stores. That means lower prices and lower margins. Announcements of store closings are becoming commonplace as weaker retailers attempt to downsize in order to survive. J.C. Penney announced plans to close as many as 140 stores after its weak holiday quarter. A sales decline wasn't the only problem with J.C. Penney's fourth-quarter report. Gross margin tumbled 100 basis points to 33.1%, with the decline driven by increased promotional activity. This need to spend heavily on markdowns and marketing in order to drive sales isn't going to go away. Cost-cutting and gains from real estate sales helped J.C. Penney break even during the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis, but the two most important numbers, comparable sales and gross margin, are moving in the wrong direction. Total U.S. retail sales in November and December of last year increased by 4%. Department stores, meanwhile, suffered a 7% sales decline. If J.C. Penney is having this much trouble despite generally strong retail sales, I don't see much hope for the company. J.C. Penney has a plan, but it's a long shot Marvin Ellison, who became CEO of J.C. Penney in August 2015 after being an executive at Home Depot for many years, has a plan to return the company to growth. The company is betting on its customers spending more on their homes and less on apparel. Major appliances made a return to J.C. Penney last year after decades of absence, and the company began testing initiatives to sell carpet and flooring. Image source: J.C. Penney. Earlier this month, J.C. Penney announced that it would begin offering turn-key services for heating and cooling systems, bathroom remodeling, installed blinds, and whole-home water solutions in some stores via partnerships with service providers and manufacturers. The company is betting that its customer base, 70% of which are female homeowners, will turn to J.C. Penney for these types of services. This isn't an unreasonable plan given the state of the department store industry, but the kind of transformation that J.C. Penney is attempting is a long shot. It seems like J.C. Penney is trying to become more like Sears, which is perhaps not the best path to take. J.C. Penney will have the opportunity to pick up market share as Sears continues to decline, but I'm not convinced a mall-based department store is a good platform for appliance and home services sales. J.C. Penney is worth less today than during the darkest depths of the financial crisis. The stock has dipped below the current level briefly over the past few years, but it's trading at about the same price as it was in 1980. The turnaround, which showed some progress over the past few years, has faltered. The plan is now to expand into new areas where J.C. Penney has no experience or competitive advantage. Investors would be wise to look elsewhere. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends AMZN. The Motley Fool recommends Home Depot.

There are 290 days left in the year. Today’s Highlight in History: On March 16, 1802, President Thomas Jefferson signed a measure authorizing the establishment of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. On this date: In A.D. 37, Roman emperor Tiberius died; he was succeeded by Caligula. In 1517, the 12th and final session of the Fifth Lateran Council of the Catholic Church took place in Rome, almost five years after the council began. In 1751, James Madison, fourth president of the United States, was born in Port Conway, Virginia. In 1792, Sweden’s King Gustav III was shot and mortally wounded during a masquerade party by a former member of his regiment (he died 13 days later). In 1926, rocket science pioneer Robert H. Goddard successfully tested the first liquid-fueled rocket at his Aunt Effie’s farm in Auburn, Massachusetts. In 1935, Adolf Hitler decided to break the military terms set by the Treaty of Versailles (vehr-SY’) by ordering the rearming of Germany. In 1945, during World War II, American forces declared they had secured Iwo Jima, although pockets of Japanese resistance remained. In 1968, during the Vietnam War, the My Lai (mee ly) Massacre of Vietnamese civilians was carried out by U.S. Army troops; estimates of the death toll vary between 347 and 504. In 1974, the Grand Ole Opry House opened in Nashville with a concert attended by President Richard Nixon and his wife, Pat. In 1987, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination. In 1991, a plane carrying seven members of country singer Reba McEntire’s band and her tour manager crashed into Otay Mountain in southern California, killing all on board. U.S. skaters Kristi Yamaguchi, Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan swept the World Figure Skating Championships in Munich, Germany. In 2003, American activist Rachel Corrie, 23, was crushed to death by an Israeli military bulldozer while trying to block demolition of a Palestinian home in the Gaza Strip. Ten years ago: Former CIA operative Valerie Plame told a House committee that White House and State Department officials had “carelessly and recklessly” blown her cover in a politically motivated smear of her husband, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, for publicly disputing President George W. Bush’s assertion that Saddam Hussein was on the brink of acquiring a nuclear bomb. Menu Foods, a major manufacturer of dog and cat food sold under Wal-Mart, Safeway, Kroger and other store brands, recalled 60 million containers of wet pet food after reports of kidney failure and deaths. Five years ago: A jury in New Brunswick, New Jersey, convicted former Rutgers University student Dharun Ravi (dah-ROON’ RAH’-vee) in the webcam spying episode that ended in the suicide of his gay roommate, Tyler Clementi. (Ravi served 20 days in jail for invasion of privacy, bias intimidation and other counts.) Actor George Clooney and his father, Nick Clooney, were arrested outside the embassy of Sudan in Washington during a protest that accused Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir of provoking a humanitarian crisis in his own country. One year ago: President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland to take the seat of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who had died the previous month; Republicans pledged to leave the seat empty until after the presidential election and said they wouldn’t even hold confirmation hearings. Washington, D.C.’s subway system began an unprecedented 29-hour safety shutdown, inconveniencing hundreds of thousands of people. Frank Sinatra Jr., 72, who carried on his famous father’s legacy with his own music career, died while on tour in Daytona Beach, Florida. Today’s Birthdays: Comedian-director Jerry Lewis is 91.

Mexico offers tariff-free quota for long-grain white rice until end of the year to lower its food costs. Wichan Charoenkiatpakul - + Thailand is expected to export 10,000 tonnes of long-grain white rice to Mexico soon after receiving a free import tariff quota from the Mexican government, says Commerce Minister Apiradi Tantraporn. Mrs Apiradi said Mexico recently allowed zero tariff for 150,000 tonnes of imported long-grain white rice from March 2 to Dec 31 this year, as its government seeks to lower the country's food costs and meet higher demand. Apart from Thailand, the Mexico has also granted the zero tariff for long-grain white rice to Argentina, India, Italy, Uruguay, Vietnam and the US. The country's import tariff for rice is normally set at 20%. Under the combined 150,000 tonnes this year, the Mexican government has set a maximum 10,000 tonnes per company to get free import tariff. Mexico's Ministry of Economy announced the quota for these countries on the Official Gazette recently, said Mrs Apiradi. "The quota allocation will be done on first-come first-serve basis so Thai companies should moves fast to ensure they benefit from the quota," said Mrs Apiradi. Exporters can ask to ship rice under the quota at the National Agro-Alimentary Health, Safety and Quality Service (Senasica), which is the food and drugs authority of Mexico. The quota accounts for 13% of total Mexican demand for rice in 2016 of 1.12 million tonnes. Mexico relies heavily on imported rice. In 2016, its demand for imported rice rose by 7% from 2015 to almost a million tonnes, or 83% of total rice consumption last year. The Mexican government has attempted to cope with the high demand over the past five years by promoting domestic rice plantation. Since then rice output per year has only risen by 8.5%. In 2016, Thailand was the fourth largest long-grain white rice supplier to Mexico, with a 3% market share, following the US, Uruguay and Argentina. The US share was as high as 45%, Uruguay 40% and Argentina 7.7% . Last year, Thailand shipped a total of 7,690 tonnes of long-grain white rice to Mexico worth US$ 3.3 million, which was about 50% lower than 2015, both in terms of volume and value. The decrease of Thai rice exports in Mexico was mainly due to higher logistics costs than its rival countries. Mrs Apiradi said that the ministry has planned to promote Thai rice more aggressively through Mexican rice importers and retailers such as Costco Department Store which operates 37 branches in Mexico, and Walmart. "Through these retailers, we hope to increase the presence of Thai rice among Latin American countries," said Mrs Apiradi. The Commerce Ministry anticipates Thai milled rice exports to reach 10 million tonnes this year, of which 5.2 million are expected to be sold in Africa, 2.2 million tonnes in Asia, 600,000 tonnes to the US, 400,000 tonnes to the euro zone, 360,000 tonnes to the Middle East and 210,000 tonnes to Oceania. Rice sales through government- to-government deals (G2G) comprise deals with China, under which Thailand has agreed to deliver 100,000 tonnes per month this year. Further G2G deals are under discussions with Indonesia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Egypt. Duangporn Rodphaya, director-general the Foreign Trade Department said the Commerce Ministry will lead the Thai delegation to Japan to meet rice exporters there in March 7-10. She added that the Thai delegation hopes to discuss the opportunities to export short-grain white rice to Japan before Japan's Crop Production Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries begins its annual rice import auction for 2017 in April until March 2018. Thai rice shipments to Japan average more than 300,000 tonnes per year. In 2016, Japan imported 325,436 tonnes from Thailand, an increase of 15% from the year before. For the first month of this year, Japan has imported almost 46,000 tonnes of Thai rice, an increase of 37% from last year.

Prices are up 3.2 percent since the same month a year earlier, according to the Zions Bank Wasatch Consumer Price Index. The national index went up slightly more last month — 0.3 percent — but the year-over-year comparison came in short of Utah's at 2.7 percent. Housing prices were the driving force in Utah's increase, said Zions Bank President and CEO Scott Anderson. They rose 1.6 percent last month, a meaningful amount since housing accounts for 38 percent of the expenses incurred by the average Utahn. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "A strong housing market translates to a stronger overall economy throughout the state," Anderson noted. "As housing prices rise, residents are more confident in the value of their homes. They then become confident in their purchasing power, which has positive repercussions across the economy." The monthly report, collected and analyzed by The Cicero Group, showed higher prices for various goods and services (up 2.4 percent), food consumed at home (0.7 percent), education and communication (0.6 percent) and clothing (0.4 percent). Prices dipped for medical care (3.4 percent), food eaten away from home (1.6 percent), transportation (1.5 percent) and utilities (0.2 percent). Grand Summit Hotel to close for renovation When ski season ends in mid-April, the Grand Summit Hotel in the Canyons Village at Park City Resort will close for a $15 million renovation. It will emerge in mid-summer flagged as a RockResorts property, referring to the wholly owned subsidiary of Vail Resorts, Inc., which operates Park City Resort. "We couldn't be more excited to bring the interior of the Grand Summit Hotel up to the same caliber as the world-class resort that's just steps away from the property," said Jim Dulanty, president of the Grand Summit Hotel Owner's Association. All 212 suites will get new interior furnishings, appliances, art and technology. Communal spaces also will be renovated, including the lobby, front desk, spa, cafe, general store and meeting area, said Ron Neville, Vail Resorts' vice president of hospitality. 3,700 Walmart workers shared in $769,000 in bonuses More than 3,700 Walmart workers in the Salt Lake County area shared $769,000 in bonuses in their March 9 checks for strong performances by their stores in last year's fourth quarter. Todd Siron, Walmart's regional vice president, said employees across Utah got $1.8 million, part of the $157 million paid out by the retail giant to workers nationwide. Besides bonuses, he added, Walmart promoted 2,630 Utah employees to higher paying positions and converted another 1,830 from part-time to full-time status.

Tax reform is going to be an epic battle in the swamp of K Street in Washington, pitting special interest versus special interest. The border adjustment tax may end up being the glue that keeps the plan together. Along the Appalachian Trail lies the vestiges of economic destruction: burned-out buildings, empty factories and unemployment lines. Much of the ruin has been caused by policies instituted by Washington politicians who remain clueless as to why everyone in America isn't as happy or prosperous as those living around the Beltway. Voters want policies that will bring jobs back the United States. Trump famously pointed out the decline in American manufacturing when he said on the campaign trail, "It used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now cars are made in Mexico, and you can't drink the water in Flint, but we’re going to turn this around." There are two ways to turn this around. One, a massive lowering of the corporate income tax, which will stop punishing companies for remaining in the U.S. Two, by moving forward policies that reward domestic manufacturing of goods, including the innovative use of 3-D printing and other advanced manufacturing techniques. ADVERTISEMENT For the inside-the-Beltway crowd, such talk is considered "dark" or "foreboding," but for many American voters — some of whom have voted Democrat for generations — it is honest, straight-talk hitting the reality they live in everyday. And to the shock of many, Trump means what he says and he intends to turn the fortunes of the unfortunates around.   A core component of the president's plan to "hire Americans and buy American" is the establishment of a border adjustment tax. The proposal has drawn opposition from some academics who are critical of Trump plan to shift the tax system to a destination-based tax. These same critics ignore the fact that the American tax code, along with a plethora of regulations and red tape, has simply incentivized American companies to ship jobs and facilities overseas while other competing countries do exactly the opposite. Trump wants to normalize trade taxes because, right now, our trading partners tax American goods exported, but foreign goods are not taxed when imported. That does not make much sense. Mexico, for example, adds a 16 percent tax American companies must pay when bringing goods south of the border, but there is no corresponding tax when Mexican companies ship goods in the United States. Also criticizing the plan — and lobbying Congress to oppose the tax — are Fortune 500 companies such as Wal-Mart. These companies have been the beneficiaries of the very thing the bill seeks to fix: the massive migration of jobs and manufacturing overseas. Consumers may get marginally cheaper goods, but the long-term harm to the U.S. economy by allowing unbalanced trade policies is large. Blindly clinging to "free trade" positions might make sense in the think-tank ivory tower or in the boardroom bubble, but this thinking is of little consolation to the men and women who have lost their jobs on the assembly line or in the textile plant. It simply makes common sense to lower corporate taxes and make up some of the tax dollars lost by shifting the tax system to a destination-based tax, balancing what other nations pile on U.S.-made goods. The reality is that the current system places American companies at a disadvantage, and that is ultimately bad for everyone. Creating equity for American business is far from a liberal concept. In fact, corporate tax reform and parity with other countries' rates has been at the top of conservatives' wish lists for decades. The Trump plan will normalize trade taxes with our competitors, creating a level playing field while encouraging companies to stay in the United States. There will be no need to repatriate foreign profits of American companies if the tax code is modified to allow companies to remain home in the U.S. with a lower corporate tax rate. One of the strongest arguments for the border adjustment provision is that it may end up being the linchpin for comprehensive tax reform. In other words, if the border tax goes down in flames, the entire tax reform effort is likely to also crash and burn. If Congress attempts to massively lower tax rates for corporations and does not find some balancing increase to make up some of the lost revenue, then there is little chance the bill can pass. The border adjustment provision balances the revenues lost by lowering the corporate income tax while punishing American companies that flee the United States to hire cheap foreign labor. American corporations have become shackled by our government. High corporate taxes coupled with massive regulations have put American competitiveness behind the eight ball. A comprehensive tax reform bill that reducing tax and regulation burdens and levels the trading playing field with our competitors, will make America great again.

When I’d try to talk sometimes, I’d just get gobbledy-gook. An echo. Almost any sound. “Oh, my God, though, I had perfect pitch. I could sing anything. My dad would say, ‘Man. Wow. She can do that all normally.’ I stuck out like a sore thumb. Music was my outlet. He’d say, ‘It’s like you’re walking in the rain and all the drops are hitting you on the head.’ ” Stacy, with roots in the Central Valley, still conjures up a storm singing in a revived version of the Screaming Bloody Marys. After what they characterize as a “long disappearance,” the San Francisco punk-rock band has re-emerged. Stacy, as unguarded, outspoken, excitable and volatile as expected, was picked in 2015 to help re-energize the re-emergence. Guitar player Dave Dalton convinced drummer Greg Langston. The added encouragement of Richard “Handsome Dick” Manitoba (Blum), who once flamboyantly led New York’s Dictators, helped. Since genuine punk attitude rarely diminishes, The Screaming Bloody Marys are back, playing Saturday at Stockton’s Whiskey Barrel Tavern. Stockton’s Polyester Wags and The Delta Infidels join them. “So, yeah, you can say punk is a youth rebellion,” said Stacy, 43, a graduate of Modesto’s Grace Davis High. “None of us is ‘young’ anymore. But punk is the rebel music of all ages. It’s having a resurgence. It’s great.” Stacy, who’s sung in punk bands with a wide variety of gender blends, is writing and rewriting songs for “Get off, Get Out, Get,” a revision of “Get in, Get Off, Get Out,” the group’s 1995 debut. Though there are conflicting views in the band — Dalton, Langston, Juan Jesus (guitar) and Hans Hunt (bass) — Stacy’s not ignoring the toxicity and inequity in American society. “We have different ideas,” said Stacy, who’s coped with Asperger’s syndrome and epilepsy since childhood. “We can talk it out, instead of putting a ban on Muslims and calling Mexicans ‘evil’ and ‘rapists.’ I’m really inspired to speak up and speak out. ... I can’t believe it. I feel I have a huge responsibility — while I can speak — to speak for those who can’t.” That includes women’s perspectives. “They need me as the ‘soul’ of the show, if nothing else,” she said of her lyrical input. “I’ve never been in a band of all men before. For a long time, I’ve been an anarchist. Democratic socialism. I can sing or write anything. The back catalog has some that are kind of offensive.” The album-in-the-works is a delayed reaction to “ceaseless touring and togetherness” that caused the band to “self-destruct and left (a) much-anticipated second full-length album to remain unreleased.” Back then, Stacy was singing in a variety of bands, including the all-woman Venus Bleeding, formed in Modesto. Middagh Goodwin helped them schedule shows in Stockton. Born in Hayward, Stacy’s lived in Modesto, Berkeley, San Francisco and “every part” of Oakland. “Usually, the parts that feel more comfortable and seem more like Stockton or Modesto,” she said after “two late-night double shifts” at the Saturn Cafe, a vegan Berkeley co-op where she’s worked for six years. Dad, Rory Gibbons, worked in Lathrop and mom Jeannette was a Walmart employee. “We were some kind of ‘Brady Bunch,’ ” Stacy said of her extended family. My folks were so supportive.” She and husband David Stacy, a guitar player from Lodi and Stockton, have a daughter, Calliope, 6, who copes with health issues similar to her mom’s. They’ve also lived Louisville, Kentucky, and Portland, Oregon. David sells German ales and beers for Gordon Biersch. Angelique was rejected by “my first” punk band at 13, but started her own Modesto group (Pale): “When they saw me on stage, they thought they’d made the ‘biggest mistake in our life.’ They thought I wasn’t ready.” She played flute in her high school band; sang opera; took some modern-dance courses at University of the Pacific as a teenager; wrote song lyrics and participated in open-mic poetry. She sang in Chapter Black, a band that toured with the Screaming Bloody Marys; the East Bay Drifters, a country-music band; TNA, a bluegrass group; and Charm School Dropout with her husband. They won Sammy Hagar’s “birthday party” contest in 2005. Her diverse interests and attitudes power her punk persona. “If I may say so, I’m pretty spiritual,” she said. “That’s how it feels to me on stage. I’m a 43-year- old, middle-aged fat woman. When I step on stage, all the fear is gone. I’m a force of nature. A hurricane storm on a nice sunny day. it’s all there. It’s punk rock. It’s one of the perfect outlets. It doesn’t have to be perfect.” — Contact Tony Sauro at (209) 546-8267 or tsauro@recordnet.com.

The Bureau’s Food at Home index, a proxy for retail supermarket prices, was down by 1.7% from February of 2016, but better than January’s year-on-year 1.9% decline. It was the 15th consecutive month the index was negative on a year-over-year basis, the longest such stretch since 1950. Although analysts said the February figures are likely to have a modest benefit for supermarket retailers, the news wasn’t entirely positive. The Producer Price Index, released earlier this week, noted that input costs were down from January, suggesting lower retail prices could stick around still longer, Karen Short, an analyst at Barclays, said in a research note. Lower retail prices have put enormous pressure on food retailers to maintain sales volumes and have come in addition to an increased pace of price cuts from Walmart. “Lingering deflation is contributing to what we view as one of the most difficult operating environments in food retail that we can recall. As a result, the extremely challenging operating environment in [the second half of 2016] has likely extended into [the first quarter],” Short said. As compared to last month, the index was up 0.2%, as retail prices held steady or improved in four of six major grocery categories. Only cereals and bakery products and “other” grocery categories (both down 0.4% from January) worsened. Retails for meats, poultry fish and eggs; fruits and vegetables; dairy; and nonalcoholic beverages improved from January. On a 12-month basis, the meat (-3.3%), fruits and vegetables (-4.7%), cereals and bakery products (-1.7%) and other (-0.1%) categories remained deflationary, while dairy and related products showed a 0.4% retail price increase from February of last year and nonalcoholic beverage prices were up by 0.1%. The CPI for food away from home was up by 2.4% on a year-over-year basis, with slightly stronger inflation among full-service establishments (+2.6%) than limited-service counterparts (+2.3%).

Lambright entered a blind plea of guilty to the reckless operation of a tractor-trailer, operating a vehicle over bridge, causeway or viaduct while weighing more than maximum weight, disregarding an official traffic control device, and operating a motor vehicle in violation of restriction. She will be sentenced on April 12 at 1:30 p.m. Lambright apologized for her actions, saying she was really tired and on her way home to celebrate Christmas with her family when the accident happened. Lambright says when she crossed the bridge that crosses Lick Creek in downtown Paoli, she didn't realize her semi was too tall and too heavy to cross. "I made the mistake and I'm so very sorry it happened," she said in January 2016. Officials say the semi was carrying 43,000 pounds of bottled water. Police say Lambright couldn't comprehend how much six tons was - the weight limit posted on the bridge. The tractor-trailer and load weighed more than 30 tons. According to police, Lambright was traveling on U.S. 150 East and was attempting to make a delivery at Walmart when she failed to turn north onto State Road 37. In an attempt to head north toward the store she turned north on South Gospel Street and then attempted to turn west onto Oak Street, but was unable to. Lambright told police that she knew there was a parking lot north of South Gospel Street and thought she could turn the truck around in the lot and again make her way back to State Road 37. There was equipment parked in the lot and she could not get turned around. Lambright says she was uncomfortable backing up the semi and didn't think to call police or another driver for assistance so she attempted to cross the iron bridge. Police say that Lambright was traveling more than 30 miles per hour in order to get the vehicle stuck that far on the bridge. Once she started onto the bridge, the trailer got stuck, ripping about a third of the trailer top off. Then the weight of the vehicle made the bridge begin to collapse, pushing both sides of the bridge inward. Crews are making repairs, which are expected to be finished in July. in October, the Orange County commissioners signed a contract with CLR Inc. to make the estimated $748,875 in repairs. The trucking company's insurance carrier, Progressive, will pay for the repairs. The insurance company will not pay the cost of repainting portions of the bridge. That cost, estimated at $39,975 and will be paid by the county. Tweet « Previous Article Next Article »  Print    Archive    RSS Have a question or comment about a news story?

Last Wednesday was International Women’s Day. Women were encouraged to take the day off, avoid shopping and wear red to show their solidarity. When was this special day added to the calendar? Unbeknownst to me it’s been around since the early 1900s but has attracted very little attention – until this year. It seems there’s a day dedicated for just about anything. We have President’s Day, Ground Hog Day, Grandparents Day, Mothers Day, etc. Even May Day, widely celebrated by communist nations worldwide, is gaining in popularity in some areas of the United States. Seattle and Portland are particularly fond of this day. Red is also the color of choice. International Women’s Day, or A Day Without A Woman as it was marketed, advocates gender equality but the real reason for the heightened focus was to prolong protests against the new presidential administration. I’m proud to say women represent 80 percent of the total employees here at the Mountain Democrat. And from what I observed, all opted to work last Wednesday. At least I think they did. Some men may relish a day without women. One day may be easy; try six. Recently, my wife traveled to Tennessee to visit our youngest daughter. Six days is a long time. My wife has always been the glue that keeps our household running like a finely oiled machine. So without her I do my best just to keep the machine operating. At 11:30 one night I was forced to run another machine – the washing machine, because I didn’t have any clean T-shirts. Other guys facing the same dilemma would likely make a quick trip to Wal-Mart. “Don’t forget to walk the dogs in the afternoon” she reminded me the day I dropped her off at the airport. “I guess that means I have to feed them, too?” I replied. The next morning when I couldn’t decide what tie to wear I resorted to option two – a sweater. One day without my wife is one day too long. So the premise for International Women’s Day was for working women to stand up and be united – fight for gender equality, better working conditions and pay equity. Actually women are light-years ahead of where they were a hundred years ago. Like the slogan of the old Virginia Slims cigarette commercial declared “You’ve come a long way, baby.” Or should that be “You’ve come a long way, lady … mame … Ms.?” Women protesting in Washington, D.C. last week were seen wearing those silly pink “vagina” hats. Those were the same hats worn during the Women’s March in January. Not sure how the hats relate to improving women’s social and economic issues other than to confirm the physical differences between the sexes. But I will attest I’m sure glad they celebrated for just the one day. Well deserved. Take that from a guy who knows first-hand what it’s like to be without a woman – for six days! And not to be slighted, there’s good news for men. International Men’s Day is on the calendar Sunday, Nov. 19. Yes, guys, we get to celebrate too. The objective of International Men’s Day is to focus on men’s health, improving gender relations, promoting gender equality and highlight positive male role models. Sound familiar? For some reason I don’t believe it will be as popular as last week. But in any event I’m planning on skipping work to watch news coverage of men protesting in the streets. Maybe the ladies can loan these men their “vagina” hats to wear that day. This gesture could go a long way toward improving gender relations but then again judging by the attitude of men these days they probably already own their own pink “vagina” hats.

 I turned off all the features on this $200 smartwatch, and now it’s the minimalist ‘dumb watch’ of my dreams Avery Hartmans Mar. 15, 2017, 12:34 PM 7,372 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Ticwatch 2. Avery Hartmans/Business Insider My first thought after unboxing the Ticwatch 2 was, "Wow, what a beautiful watch."  And it is: It's entirely black with a smooth rubber band, oversized brushed metal face, and a sleek look that's modern and sophisticated.  I loved my new watch. And then I remembered it was actually a smartwatch, which meant I had to pair it with my phone, tell it my weight — ack — and allow it to hide me for not meeting my step goals. The prospect of introducing another computer into my life seemed exhausting.  I gave the Ticwatch a fair shake, though. I downloaded the app, set up Bluetooth pairing, and entered a few fitness goals. I dutifully stood up when it told me to, enjoying the subtle, conspiratorial buzz at my wrist. I enjoyed the thickness of the watch face, the weight of it, and even the feeling like it could easily be a very chic house arrest bracelet. I even kind of liked that it bugged me with Slack messages I had already read on my actual computer. "You're still learning," I thought. "One day you'll actually be smart." But in my heart of hearts, I knew I didn't really want it to be smart. Its intelligence seemed unnecessary — annoying, even — when all I really wanted was to look at something pretty.  So I unpaired it, took away its gesture commands, disabled messaging and calling, and fiddled with the watch face until I found a digital display in a cool, modern-looking layout. In short, I turned it into the minimalist "dumb watch" of my dreams. Avery Hartmans/Business Insider Life is better these days. Sure, without its prodding, I'm often not standing up for an hour at a time. And yes, perhaps I don't feel shamed into walking home instead of taking the subway in order to meet my rigid step goals. I'm not as connected to my emails and messages as I could be, and I'm wearing a $200 product as a simple digital watch, something that could easily be achieved with a $22.99 Timex version from Walmart.  My problem was that the Ticwatch did too much. Its frequent need to be charged required outlet space I couldn't spare, its capabilities neither replaced nor complemented my iPhone's, and it constantly distracted me by lighting up and begging for my attention. And that's not a knock on the watch itself, which is a perfectly fine smartwatch — it's the problem with the smartwatch industry as a whole.  So for now, I'll keep enjoying my beautiful, dumb watch.  SEE ALSO: A fashion expert just nailed why smartwatches have never really caught on NOW WATCH: A mathematician gave us the easiest explanation of pi and why it’s so important Loading video...

Developer attorney Dominick Thomas said downsizing the project even more isn’t feasible because it must generate enough funds to pay for a $2-million extension of the city sewer line to the site. Thomas emphasized that extending the sewer line represented a major infrastructure improvement that would benefit the city, especially the surrounding neighborhood. The city’s sewer line doesn’t go that far south on River Road (Route 110), ending near Constitution Boulevard South in the vicinity of the Toll Brothers Shelton Cove development. Some properties near the marina are able to hook up to the Stratford sewer system via Long Hill Avenue, including the Crescent Village condos across the street. Opponents are worried about the density of the project along the riverfront and its impact on water views from the road and nearby properties. “Where’s the river?” shouted one skeptic when Thomas showed renderings of the plan, with four multi-story apartment buildings near the water, at the Planning and Zoning Commission’s March 7 meeting. P&Z member Elaine Matto said she worried people living across the street would be “looking over the top of these buildings.” Opponents also complained about traffic and overdevelopment throughout the city. Resident Jan Girard said excess development will lead to traffic backups and overcrowded schools. “The quality of life for the residents is going down,” she said, insisting that developers don’t have an automatic right to make money in Shelton. The P&Z’s public hearing on the application now is closed, and a vote is expected soon. P&Z member Anthony Pogoda indicated he thought the proposal still was too intense for the site. “I think there’s too many units,” he said, adding that the elimination of one building was a “good start.” Modified PDD The Great River Water Club would occupy the 8.6-acre property on the Housatonic River at 704-722 River Road, where Beacon Point Marina now is located. In 2007, the P&Z approved a Planned Development District (PDD) for the property with 31 condo units, an enlarged marina, a restaurant, and a pool club. However, based on market conditions, the developer now wants to modify the earlier PDD. “You had to rethink your development” after the Great Recession, Thomas told the P&Z. The plan’s latest revision has four apartment buildings of up to five or six stories with 154 total units, a clubhouse with a pool, and a marina with 75 slips and a maintenance building. There would be underground and surface parking for apartment residents and marina users, three driveways on River Road, public walkways along the river, and five public parking spaces. The modified PDD plan originally had its own wastewater treatment plant, but that idea was strongly criticized and then replaced by the possible sewer line extension. City Engineer Robert Kulacz said the on-site treatment plant would mean “treated effluent will be discharged directly into the Housatonic River.” Thomas said the property now generates $28,000 in taxes, but the city should reap $142,000 a year post-development after projected education and other expenses. While the plan would increase the amount of on-site impervious coverage, Thomas said, it includes a drainage system to treat all runoff before it reaches the river. He disputed claims the new plan involved limited water-dependent uses, as desired for waterfront properties, pointing to the docks, boat service facilities, and small vessel storage. Thomas also downplayed concerns with blocked river views, saying Crescent Village is much higher than the marina site because of topography. He said concerns about too much development destroying Shelton are common, such as when people feared a new Walmart on Bridgeport Avenue. “The exact same thing was said,” he recalled. ‘Not what we want’ About 10 residents spoke against the proposal at the March 7 meeting. Adrienne Couture said dense residential projects were being allowed “everywhere” in Shelton. We’re telling you with as much energy and fortitude that this is not what we want for this town,” she said. Joseph Bienkowski questioned how a 31-unit condo could be replaced by a 154-unit apartment complex. “I don’t recall voting to become Stamford. I don’t remember that referendum,” he said. Greg Tetro said Crescent Village residents would have their river views blocked “because someone else is getting rich. … All we’re doing is developing, developing, developing. We’re going to have a glut.” Glen Swanson said the project would make traffic “horrendous” on River Road. He worried about the safety of youngsters crossing the street near the Sports Center, saying a traffic light was needed. Attorney Chris Russo, representing a Crescent Village resident opposed to the project, said the 5,000-foot linear sewer extension would require tearing up a major road for almost a mile. He said the original PDD was partly approved because of its public access components, and the new proposal has less of that. Conservation Commission Chairman Tom Harbinson asked if more designated public parking could be added off River Road. He said the earlier PDD had a restaurant for the public. P&Z member James Tickey said having so few public spaces was “disappointing,” and could lead to people parking along Route 110 and creating public safety issues. Marina owner and project developer Richard Kral said the number of public parking spaces was increased from three to five, based on Conservation Commission input, and that should be “more than adequate.” “We are a business,” said Kral, indicating he needs spaces for marina patrons.

That experience—and the guitarist’s efforts to help the defenseless animal—led to a new song, “I Saved a Bird Today.” Today, GuitarAficionado.com presents the premiere of the track, plus Frampton’s just-announced tour dates, all of which you can check out below. The song, which features a melodic acoustic guitar solo that starts at the 2:50 marker, strikes the ear as a nod to a few of Frampton’s influences and friends; there’s a touch of Django Reinhardt in the intro and an unmistakable smattering of what can only be called “George Harrison chords” during the verse (2:26). “‘To care for one another is the reason we are here’—this lyric sums up the song for me,” Frampton says. “We are all in uncharted territory right now. ‘Perhaps today, [the bird] was on her way to rescue me,’ which doesn’t seem too far off from what we all need. Politeness and caring for each other cannot be a thing of the past. I can’t explain how great the feeling was to have saved a life. Peace, love and truth trump hate every time.” The new tour dates include a relaunch of Peter Frampton Raw: An Acoustic Tour, which features longtime collaborator Gordon Kennedy and Peter’s guitar-playing son, Julian. Frampton also will tour with the Steve Miller Band this summer. See below for full routing details and visit frampton.com. “I Saved a Bird Today” is available via Amazon and iTunes.

Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) filed a complaint Tuesday with White House counsel Don McGhan, accusing assistant to the president and director of strategic initiatives Christopher Liddell of improperly participating in meetings that took place between Trump and companies in which Liddell held millions of dollars in stock.  According to CREW: Criminal law prohibits a federal employee like Liddell from participating personally and substantially in any particular matter to which, to his knowledge, he has a financial interest. On January 23rd, Liddell participated with Trump in a meeting with business leaders from 12 companies, including 10 in which Liddell appears to have held stock worth approximately $2.1 million: Arconic, Corning, Dell Technologies, Dow Chemical, Ford Motor Co., International Paper, Johnson & Johnson, Lockheed Martin, Tesla Motors, and Whirlpool. The next day, he and Trump held a meeting with General Motors, Ford Motors and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to discuss new factories. Liddell and his wife apparently held $72,000 of stock in Ford and GM. On February 3rd, Liddell again participated in a meeting with business leaders representing companies in which he apparently owned $2.3 million of stock: BlackRock, GM, IHS Markit LTD, IMB, JP Morgan Chase, Pepsi, Tesla, and Walmart. The Office of Government Ethics (OGE) has since issued a certificate of divestiture covering those holdings—but as the CREW complaint (pdf) notes, that certificate is dated February 9, well after the meetings in question.  As such, the complaint reads, and given Liddell's likely role in organizing those meetings and developing and/or approving the invite lists, "he may be viewed as having personally and substantially participated in the White House meetings [...] that would have a direct and predictable effect on his financial interests." Since Trump's inauguration, CREW has sued the president for overstepping the federal Emoluments Clause; sent two letters to the White House regarding advisor Kellyanne Conway's "improper use of office to benefit a private interest;" and notified McGahn of "apparent violations of the Federal Advisory Committee Act because outside advisors, often connected with major corporations, have participated in organized efforts to advise the president without complying with transparency and accountability rules." Late last week, OGE director Walter Shaub expressed concern that the executive branch apparently thinks it is above many ethical regulations. As CREW executive director Noah Bookbinder said of Tuesday's complaint, "This marks the latest in an already too-long list of ethics letters CREW has sent to McGahn. The White House must show that potential ethics violations will be taken seriously and thoroughly investigated."

Warren Previous Next A woman gets out of a Lyft car in Seattle, where Uber is suing the city for passing a law allowing Uber drivers to unionize. There will be a push by ride-hailing companies like Uber to get a pool of drivers signed up now that the provincial Liberal government has set a target of December for bringing their services to B.C. There are some telling examples of what drivers in other cities have faced as would-be drivers in B.C. try to figure out what wages and conditions Uber will offer here. Uber Canada says the number of drivers in B.C. who might be interested in working with them is in the tens of thousands, based on information sessions it has run over the last year in Kelowna, Victoria, Vancouver and Surrey. In Houston, meanwhile, there are drivers commuting several few hours to Austin so they can avoid working with Uber. Instead, they are opting to drive for smaller, ride-hailing companies that leave them with $100 or even $200 more at the end of each day than they would get with Uber, according to CNNMoney last week. Uber and Lyft, another large ride-hailing company, decided to leave the Austin market last May because city officials there wanted their drivers to be fingerprinted. Their departure led to the flourishing of new and local apps such as Ride Austin and Fasten. In Houston, Uber drivers get 87 cents a mile, a figure that has dropped in recent years, said CNNMoney, which profiled one woman who got into financial trouble when Uber lowered its prices and changed its commission split. She eventually discovered that making the three hour trek from Houston to Austin was worth the trouble of sleeping in her car, which she would park “in an Austin Wal-Mart or apartment complex” every night from Thursday to Sunday. She now splits an apartment in Houston with three other drivers who also travel to Austin because they can earn more there than driving for Uber in Houston. It’s typical for a company like Uber to court drivers with generous rates until it is the dominant player, said Sumeet Gulati, a UBC professor of environmental and resource economics, who has researched these ride-hailing companies. After that, however, he worries that wages for drivers can fall to the point where they might not earn minimum wage. Doing informal research, Gulati talked to some drivers in Atlanta making as little as US$10 an hour during off-peak hours, and they had yet to account for expenses such as insurance and wear-and-tear on their car. He spoke to one woman who “lived in a nice neighbourhood and had a decent job and was trying to make some extra money to see a game” as well as a “programmer for Apple who was driving on his day off.” Said Gulati of the potential pressure on wages: “There is a lot of underused capital in North American cities. People have cars and have time.” At one point, Gulati paid an Uber driver in Atlanta a mere “$3 for a 40-minute ride. It was off-peak, but I started questioning if wages will fall to the point where people will stop driving or unionize.” In Seattle, Uber is suing the city after it approved a law that allows drivers for Uber and Lyft to unionize and collectively bargain for better working conditions, earnings and other benefits. Uber Canada official Susie Heath cited research by Princeton University professor Alan Krueger, who looked at the labour market for Uber drivers at the end of 2016, finding that hourly earnings (before expenses) remained stable even as prices fell and that hourly earnings aren’t related to how many hours a person drives per week. © Copyright Times Colonist Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

Troy Hunt, who published news of the leak, said the information had "enormous" potential for scammers. Business services firm Dun & Bradstreet confirmed to tech news site ZDNet that it owns the data. Information on government departments and private sector employees is commonly collated by business services that sell the data to other companies, such as marketing firms. In this case, the records - including names, job titles and contact details - were originally compiled by NetProspex, which was acquired by Dun & Bradstreet in 2015. Organisations with employees mentioned in the data include the US Postal Service, telecoms giant AT&T and the retailer Walmart. Mr Hunt pointed out that people might try to use the names and email addresses in the database to scam or retrieve sensitive information from recipients - a practice known as spear phishing. "The value for very targeted spear phishing is enormous because you can carefully craft messages that refer to specific individuals of influence and their roles within the organisation," he wrote on his blog. Dun & Bradstreet said: "Based on our analysis, it is our determination that there has been no exposure of sensitive personal information from, and no infiltration of our system. "The information in question is data typically found on a business card. "As general practice, Dun & Bradstreet uses an agile security process and evaluates and evolves security controls to protect the integrity of our data." This is the latest in a long string of personal data caches dumped online. In January, personal information of health workers in the US Army was found online by another security professional.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup World The wisdom of a Maine hermit who lived in the woods for 27 years is finally revealed New book details life of Christopher Knight, who spent nearly 30 years living alone in Maine woods. By Ewan Palmer Updated March 15, 2017 15:38 GMT Maine State Police photo shows the makeshift campsite of Christopher Knight Reuters A new book has shone some light surrounding the mystery of a man who chose to completely give up his life aged just 20 and spend nearly three decades alone in the woods. Christopher Knight made worldwide news in 2013 after he was arrested attempting to steal food from a youth camp in Rome, Maine, having been living in solitude for the past 27 years. During questioning Knight said the policeman who arrested him was only the second person he has come into contact with since 1986 after previously exchanging a brief "hi" with a hiker sometime in the 90s. Despite speaking to virtually no-one for nearly three decades, Knight was willing to talk to author Michael Finkel about why he decided to walk away from his life in 1986, which have since been revealed in his new book The Stranger in the Woods: The Extraordinary Story of the Last True Hermit. Sort of. "I can't explain my actions," Knight said in an extract of the book published by the Guardian. "I had no plans when I left, I wasn't thinking of anything. I just did it." He adds: "I had no one to tell. I didn't have any friends. I had no interest in my co-workers." During his 27 years, Knight claims he only spent one night indoors at an unoccupied cabin but the "sleepless worry about getting caught" forced him to live the rest of the time in a makeshift campsite. Christopher Knight was arrested after almost three decades of living like a hermit near a pond in central MaineReuters In order to survive during his 27 years in almost complete solitude, Knight is believed to have committed more than 1,000 burglaries as he scrounged for food and other supplies. In 2013, police said Knight treated Pine Tree, a camp retreat for disabled children close to where he settled, as "a local Walmart". Finkel describes Knight's alleged stealing as "almost certainly the biggest burglary case in the history of Maine". As interest in Knight exploded, the media was desperate was desperate to know what insight a man who has lived almost compete solitude for the past 27 years could give to the rest of the world. Knight could only give one answer: "Get enough sleep." The Stranger in the Woods: The Extraordinary Story of the Last True Hermit by Michael Finkel is available now.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint One evening a couple of years ago, I was sitting at my desk in Ireland when the e-mail pinged. It was from my wife. Nothing unusual there. That is, until I opened her message and saw what was inside. It was a photo of a Labrador — large, fluffy and sprayed a kind of luminescent, hi-vis shade of green. Minutes later, the inbox pinged again. This time the e-mail contained startling images of an Irish Elvis, complete with angled quiff and shamrock decorations on his spangled Vegas outfit. Another picture showed a pint of beer dyed to a lurid, biliously green. By now, of course, I cottoned on to what was happening. The date was March 17. My wife was standing in a St. Paul skyway, gazing at the St. Patrick’s Day Parade on the avenue below. The messages were intended to send me a little cheer. I was stuck in Belfast, winding up our personal affairs, while she was working an exciting new job in the Twin Cities. I was eager to join her. “Welcome to St. Patrick’s Day, American-style!” the e-mails seemed to trumpet. “A whole new way of doing things awaits you!” New indeed. In all my puff (as we say back in Belfast), I’d never seen a dog dyed green, or any Hound Dog boasting Irish credentials. As for squirting artificial coloration into a fellow’s pint of porter — well, that was the ultimate desecration. How had these abominations occurred? Why had America splashed its tawdry commercialism and showbiz antics all over Ireland’s hallowed St. Patrick’s Day celebration? Could I really live in such a barbarously inclined nation? These and other dark thoughts swirled in my brain as I started clicking around the internet for explanations. And here is what I quickly learned: I was holding the wrong end of the stick entirely. Turns out, the modern St. Patrick’s Day Parade originated in the United States, not on the streets of “dear dirty Dublin,” as Ireland’s greatest novelist James Joyce once put it. The first parade took place in New York City in 1762, 14 years before the Declaration of Independence was signed. The event was organized by a bunch of homesick Irish patriots and soldiers serving in the British military. In that first New York parade, Irish songs were sung, pipers played their pipes, green clothing was sported and the Irish language spoken. These traditions persist. By the time the first St. Patrick’s parade unfolded in Ireland, in 1903, the template for celebrating the day was firmly established. Essentially, we in Ireland started imitating what Americans had been doing for well over a century. Not all the imitation has been welcome. Go to a modern St. Patrick’s Day Parade in Dublin, for example, and you’re as likely to see an American-style marching band — complete with majorettes and sousaphones — as a band of traditional Irish pipers. Pointless cultural dilution? Just a little. Controversy has also fumed in recent years about the negative stereotyping of Irish people in American St. Patrick’s Day celebrations. You probably know the kind of thing — idiotic leprechaun costumes and T-shirts emblazoned with messages such as “I may not be Irish, but I can drink like one.” The Ancient Order of Hibernians, one of the largest Irish organizations in the U.S., took exception to these allegedly demeaning garments, and asked Wal-Mart (one of the outlets selling them) for an apology. With all due respect to the Hibernians, that seems a bit of an overreaction. We Irish have always been, for better or worse, perfectly happy telling jokes about ourselves. I’ve been a Minnesota resident for all of two years. Now that the cultural shock has subsided, I personally find it easier to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day here than I ever did in Ireland. It’s not easy being green in Northern Ireland (the part of the United Kingdom where I grew up), where the St. Patrick’s Day Parade was a predominantly Catholic affair. Northern Protestants like me found the event a little alien. It served as yet another symbol of anti-Britishness on an island long disrupted by conflicts over land, religion and nationality. Here in the U.S., I sense little or none of that political, sectarian sentiment. Here I can simply take pride in being an Irishman while celebrating my countrymen’s achievements in this immense patchwork of a country. No, I won’t be spray-painting our Irish-born dog Buddy anytime soon. Nor will I be doctoring my glass of Minnesotan craft porter (just as good as Guinness, incidentally) with a slime-green additive. I have, though, learned to love the American way of honoring St. Patrick. For all its occasional zaniness, the holiday tells an immigrant’s tale with joy. It celebrates an uprooted folk who arrived here and gradually hewed a position of well-being and respectability. This strikes me as a good message for these troubled American times. Sláinte! Enjoy St. Patrick’s Day 2017, whatever your origin or nationality.   Terry Blain writes about classical music and theater.

Lankford’s article in the March 1 issue of Oklahoma Gazette (News, “Say what?,” Laura Eastes) addressed tax-exempt status of churches and other nonprofit organizations. He wants churches to be able to support candidates for public offices in word and funds but keep their tax-free exemption. The tax exemption is for the organization. The organization is not a person and, therefore, it has no right of free speech conferred by the Bill of Rights. One of the greatest of errors of rulings by the Supreme Court was to claim corporations are people and that money is speech and that the corporations can contribute unlimited funds in elections. We the (Real) People do not want another travesty like Sen. Lankford is proposing. Chadwick Cox Norman Sold out I am intrigued that nearly all six showings of the movie I Am Not Your Negro sold out Oklahoma City Art Museum. They’ve added three more shows because so many were turned away. I’m glad that such expression truth can still draw a crowd in my old hometown. Bill Byrd Oklahoma City Not a bigot In response to Jay Hanas in the Jan. 25 Gazette (Opinion, Letters, “Trumpf nation”), I say the following: Mr. Hanas, I do not appreciate you calling me a bigot. I am married to a minority, and we both voted for President Donald Trump. I have many friends across the country who are minorities who voted for Trump for economic, security and foreign policy reasons. I have traveled to 55 nations in the world, experiencing most every culture on the planet. I also lived in a third-world nation for a number of years. There are a lot of people from various nations that support Trump because of the tepid and weak policies of President Barack Obama. My suggestion to you is to marry your rapidly aging wingnut mentor Dr. Robin Meyers and take a permanent honeymoon to New Zealand or Cuba. Michael James Oklahoma City Why lie? Why do we lie? In my opinion, we learn how to lie when we’re children. Through our childhood, we’re apt to hone our skills to a degree that if we do it right, we can get away with most situations. After all, it’s our word against our parents’. As we mature, we could come to the conclusion that it’s better to tell the truth and be out front, as opposed to our “old ways.” Well, that’s the way it should be in a moral and adult sense. But it doesn’t seem that well-intentioned ideal is shared by everybody. There are quite a few among us that believe they can live and rely on this childhood platform. You probably know many friends, coworkers, bosses and teachers who fall into this slot. The problem is those same people who live in that make-believe reality also run for political offices. Of course, one of the major problems is that the people who think as they do vote those kinds of people into office and believe that they’re normal. After all, how would they know the difference? Joe Wright Oklahoma City Role play The hilarious and karmic irony of North Carolina’s HB 2, the proposed Texas Privacy Act, and all other “bathroom bills?” In their race to be the most ignorant and hateful, the authors of these statutes failed to realize that they force fully transitioned, post-operative transgender persons to use gender-specific facilities that no longer correspond to their apparent biological identities. To wit: A girl who identifies as a boy and who subsequently undergoes testosterone therapy, breast reduction surgery, a hysterectomy and has surgically created male genitalia (and who, by the way, is almost certainly attracted to females) is now forced into the restrooms, locker rooms and public showers with women and girls — our daughters/sisters/grandmothers. Does this make them safer? Is this how we “protect” women and girls? (A red herring lie that was never the purpose of this spiteful legislation.) What about having preoperative male to female transgenders in a wig, full makeup, high heels and a dress using urinals in the mens’ rooms instead of facilities that match their identity? Will that sort of scene make cisgender men feel more confident in public restrooms? I can’t wait to see the first stories about Christian women clutching their pearls in horror after seeing what appears to be a man — with facial hair, body hair, pectorals, biceps and a penis — showering next to them at the health club or changing next to their precious virginal daughter in the high school locker room or standing up to urinate in the next stall of the Wal-Mart ladies’ room. Karma has a funny sense of humor. Jeffrey Wells Edmond Curbing harassment The disclosure that the former Speaker of the House used $44,500 of state funds for a confidential settlement with Hollie Anne Bishop (former assistant to Rep. Dan Kirby) and her attorneys for a wrongful termination suit after she reported sexual harassment elicited rightful public outrage. As a result, a special investigative House committee was appointed. Then, Carol Johnson, another former Kirby assistant, disclosed to the press her complaints of sexual harassment. A shocking picture emerged of a highly dysfunctional working environment. Kirby solicited and received topless photos of Johnson. Furthermore, one of the photos was taken in Kirby’s office. The committee recommended Kirby’s expulsion. In the same report, a complaint by a female high-school page against representative Will Fourkiller that his comments made her “feel uncomfortable” and resulted in his being banned from the high-school page program. Kudos to the committee for recommending annual sensitivity training for legislators on sexual harassment and for requiring signature of an anti-fraternization agreement every election term. The fact that Bishop had to take her grievance to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for wrongful termination due to lack of action after reporting Kirby’s sexual harassment, and similarly, the fact that when Johnson took her complaint to the House Human Resources Office she was placed on paid leave and then assigned to another legislator, indicates that this office needs to be more involved in handling these complaints. Let’s hope that clear regulations will emerge from this “snafu” and that no more tax dollars will be used to pay for legal expenses arising from moral transgressions of our elected officials. Raoul Carubelli Oklahoma City Weak candidates I am one of the Feb. 14 nonvoters. Here’s why: I spent nearly an hour in an attempt to discern who to vote for in my ward. The result: three Republicans, all “humble and loyal family men,” according to their websites. Nothing about how they stood on any important issues whatsoever. I decided to stay home instead of throwing a dart at this meaningless exercise in futility.

just-style home News & insights News US Q4 in brief – Cato Corp, DSW , Bon Ton, Tilly's, Genesco By Michelle Russell and Beth Wright | 16 March 2017 Font size Email Print In the most recent fourth-quarter filings from US apparel and footwear brands and retailers, Abercrombie & Fitch booked results that missed expectations, while The Children's Place achieved what it said was a "spectacular" year. VF Corporation, meanwhile, revealed a fall in both sales and earnings for the quarter, while Stein Mart moved to a loss as a result of "aggressive" promotions.  Cato Corp Cato Corp reported a net loss of US$12.8m for the fourth quarter, compared to net income of $11.8m in the year-ago period. Fourth-quarter gross margin decreased to 28.8% of sales from 36.1% of sales in 2015, primarily due to reduced merchandise margins and higher occupancy costs. Sales for the period were $218.2m, a decrease of 12% on last year's $247.3m. Same-store sales were also down 12% for the quarter. CEO John Cato said 2016 was a "very disappointing year" for the company. He added: "The overall apparel retail environment continued to be difficult and was compounded by several mistakes of our own.  We also are being impacted by the disruption caused by the growth of online sales at other retailers, resulting in lower store traffic.  In the back half of the year, we made several mistakes in our merchandise assortment, fit and timing.  This resulted in significant reductions to regular priced sales causing us to liquidate a large portion of our slow selling inventory which put severe pressure on earnings." DSW DSW said its return to year over year earnings growth continued in the fourth quarter, with net income rising 158.5% to US$30.5m, compared to $11.8m in the year-ago period. Gross profit increased by 50 bps, while total sales edged up slightly, increasing 0.4% to  $674.6m. Comparable sales meanwhile, decreased 7% compared to last year's 0.7% increase. CEO Roger Rawlins, said: "After making fundamental changes to our core business last year, we are laser focused on driving comp growth through our merchandise and allocation initiatives and the elevation of our customer's digital experience." The Bon-Ton Stores US department store retailer The Bon-Ton Stores saw earnings and revenue decline in the fourth quarter. The York, Pennsylvania-based company recorded net income of US$44.7m, down from $50.6m in the year-ago period. Gross margin increased 145 basis points to 36.2% compared to last year, primarily due to reduced markdowns and lower distribution costs, partially offset by deleverage from lower sales volume. Total sales in the period decreased 5.5% to $877.3m, versus $927.9m last year, while comparable store sales decreased 4.7% as compared with the prior year period. Tilly's  Apparel, footwear and accessories retailer Tilly's says it is encouraged by its fourth-quarter results as earnings reached US$6.3m from $2.9m a year earlier. Gross margin dropped to 30.6% from 31.4% last year, primarily due to a 60 basis point decline in product margins from increased markdowns and a 20 basis point increase in buying, distribution and occupancy costs. Total sales edged up 0.7% to $160.2m, while comparable sales were up 0.1%. CEO, Ed Thomas, said: "While we are encouraged by these results, we will continue to seek ways to improve profitability and continue our progress during fiscal 2017." Genesco Genesco booked declines in both earnings and revenue during the fourth quarter. Net earnings reached US$46.5m compared to earnings of $44.7m in the year-ago period. Net sales dropped 5% to $883m from $932m, reflecting the sale of the Lids Team Sports business in the fourth quarter of last year and a decrease of approximately 2% in sales from the remaining businesses. Comparable sales, including same store sales and comparable e-commerce and catalogue sales were flat  with an 8% increase in the Lids Sports Group, a 6% decrease in the Journeys Group, a 2% increase in the Schuh Group, and a 1% decrease in the Johnston & Murphy Group.  Citi Trends  US value fashion retailer Citi Trends posted profit and sales increases in its fourth-quarter. For the 13 weeks ended 28 January, net income increased 60% to US$5.6m, compared to $3.5m in the year-ago period. Sales were also up, increasing 5.4% to $185.5m from $176.1m last year, while comparable sales grew 3.4%.  The Buckle The Buckle booked a drop in both earnings and sales in the fourth quarter, with the former dropping to US$36m from $54.3m a year earlier. Revenues were down 15.7% to $280m from net sales of $332m for the year-ago period, while comparable sales fell 16.1%. Online sales were down 8.8% to $32.2m for the 13-week period ended 28 January.  Zumiez  Zumiez said its fourth-quarter earnings performance exceeded expectations,with net income in the period ended 28 January, increasing 38.3% to US$18.2m, compared to $13.1m in the year-ago period. Net sales for the quarter were also up, increasing 8.7% to $263.6m from $242.4m, while comparable sales for the period increased 5.1% compared to a 9.5% decrease last year. Differential Brands Group Differential Brands Group, which owns Robert Graham and Hudson Clothing, moved to a loss in its fourth-quarter. For the period ended 31 December, net loss from continuing operations was US$4.9m, compared to net income from continuing operations of $0.7m for the prior year period. Net sales, meanwhile, were up 108% to $42m from $20.3m in the prior year period, primarily due to the addition of the Hudson Jeans and Swims brands, as well as 3% growth in Robert Graham. Gross margin fell to 51.8% compared to 59.9% last year, reflecting the inclusion of Hudson Jeans, which carries a lower gross margin rate as a wholesale business. Sears Holdings US retail giant Sears Holdings revealed a widening of its net loss in the quarter to US$607m from $580m a year earlier. Gross margin narrowed slightly from 21.8% to 21.3%, primarily attributed to lower margins in the apparel business, and an increase in promotional activities. Net revenues fell to $6.1bn from $7.3bn in the prior year quarter. CEO Edward Lampert, noted: "We delivered significant Adjusted EBITDA improvement in the fourth quarter, reflecting our firm focus on profitability to offset ongoing revenue pressures. Building on this positive momentum, we are taking decisive actions to become a more agile and competitive retailer with a clear path toward profitability." Tailored Brands Tailored Brands, the former Men's Wearhouse, said it has booked a lower than expected fourth-quarter, despite driving its net loss down to US$30.1m, compared to $1.1bn last year. Retail gross margin increased 60 basis points to 39.0%, primarily as a result of "anniversarying" an $11m inventory write-down in last year's fourth-quarter. "Unfortunately, the challenging retail environment resulted in soft traffic across our retail brands, which drove lower than anticipated fourth quarter and full year net sales and gross margins," said CEO Doug Ewert. Express Express said its fourth-quarter earnings were in line with its guidance, despite net income dropping to US$22.8m from $56.1m a year earlier. Merchandise margin declined by 330 basis points, driven by increased promotional activity. Net sales fell 11% to $678.8m from $765.6m, while comparable sales (including e-commerce sales) decreased 13%. CEO David Kornberg, noted:  "Despite ongoing pressures in the retail sector, our fourth quarter earnings were in line with previously issued guidance. As expected, our store performance continued to be impacted by challenging mall traffic and a promotional retail environment. As our industry adapts to changing consumer preferences, we continue to invest in our omni-channel and marketing capabilities to ensure that we capitalize on this evolution."  The Children's Place, Inc The Children's Place has achieved what it says was a "spectacular" year thanks to significant progress on its numerous self-help initiatives. "Our product assortment, supported by a foundation of superior design, sourcing and merchandising capabilities, clearly resonated with our customers," said CEO Jane Elfers. Net income for the quarter almost doubled to US$34.2m from $17.5m a year earlier. Gross margin improved 50 basis points to 36.1% thanks to merchandise margin leverage and a higher Average Unit Retail (AUR). Net sales were up 4.5% to $520.8m on a comparable retail sales increase of 6.9%. For the full year, earnings soared 77% to $102.3m, while net sales were up 3.4% to $1.78bn. Stein Mart, Inc Stein Mart has revealed a "disappointing" fourth-quarter as the company continued to work through higher than desired inventory levels and the impact of changes to marketing, merchandising and promotions implemented during the third quarter. The company moved to a net loss of US$4.9m from earnings $6.3m a year earlier. Gross margin narrowed to 22.8% from 26.8% a year earlier. Total sales were down 2.2% to $385.5m, while comparable store sales dropped 5.5%. CEO Hunt Hawkins, said: "With our new executive leadership now in place, 2017 will be a year of transition as we refine and organise around our strategies. Lessons learned from last year have us keenly focused on changes we need to make to our business to significantly improve management of our inventories and increase sales productivity." Weyco Group, Inc Weyco has booked a mixed fourth-quarter as earnings rose but sales fell. For the three month period, net income amounted to US$8.3m from $8.2m a year earlier. The 2015 figure included a $458,000 earnout payment relating to the company's 2011 acquisition of the BOGS/Rafters brands. Without this, earnings would have been down 9%. Net sales for the quarter were down 6% to $82.1m. Dick's Sporting Goods Omni-channel sporting goods retailer Dick's Sporting Goods said it was pleased with its fourth-quarter, despite booking a mixed period which saw revenues rise but earnings fall. For the 13 weeks to 28 January, net income fell 30% to US$90.2m, compared to $129m in the year-ago period. Net sales increased 10.9% to US$2.5bn, while same-store sales were up 5.3%. Looking ahead, CEO Edward Stack said the company will "continue to be aggressive" and evolve its business.  Black Diamond, Inc. Black Diamond has narrowed its losses in the fourth quarter, to US$1.39bn from $31.7bn a year earlier. Gross margin narrowed to 29.1% from 33.5%, weighed down by foreign currency headwinds. Sales were down 6% to $41.4m, due to unseasonably dry European winter conditions impacting ski product sales and the company's measured approach to scaling back its apparel line. CEO John Walbrecht, said: "While we still faced foreign exchange headwinds and margin constraints due to our manufacturing repatriation, demand for climbing and mountain products remained strong. We also continued to experience growing momentum in our direct-to-consumer and independent global distributor businesses, as both channels continue to grow in the strong double-digits." Sequential Brands Brand management company Sequential Brands narrowed its losses to US$980,000 in the fourth quarter, from $5.7m in the same period last year. Revenue for the three months to 31 December increased 44% to $45.4m, compared to $31.4m in the year-ago period. For the year ending 31 December, 2017, the company is expecting $170m to $175m in revenue. CEO Yehuda Shmidman said: "Looking ahead, despite a challenging macro retail environment, we will remain focused on growing our core business and maximising operating efficiencies, inclusive of new revenue initiatives already underway." Stage Stores Stage Stores moved to a loss in the fourth quarter and revealed a drop in sales. For the quarter ended 28 January, net loss was US$6.8m versus a profit of $21m last year. Net sales fell 9.6% to $454.4m, compared to $502.6m in the year-ago period. Comparable sales were down 8.5%. CEO Michael Glazer, noted: "Our fourth-quarter adjusted earnings reflect continued challenges in our oil impacted and border states, as well as the overall soft retail environment. Weak traffic led to heightened promotional activity and gross margin pressure in the quarter, yet we are pleased to end 2016 with inventory levels that are 6% lower than last year. In addition, our direct-to-consumer business grew at a double digit rate as we enhanced our customers' online experience."   Burlington Stores Burlington Stores saw both earnings and revenue incense in the fourth quarter, booking a 27.1% rise in net income from US$98.8m to $125.6m in the year ago period. Gross margin expanded 80 basis points to 41.8%, driven by improved shortage results. Net sales were up 9.4%, or $144.9m, to $1.7bn from $1.5bn thanks to a 4.6% increase in comparable store sales and $82.1m in sales from new and non-comparable stores. For the full year, the company expects sales to increase in the range of 7.5% to 8.5%, and comparable sales to be up 2% to 3%. Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

Sales in all geographies were also down in the quarter, at 8% to $688.2m in the US, and 5% to $348.2m in international markets. CEO Fran Horowitz, said: "We continued to proactively respond to the evolving retail landscape through our store closure and channel optimisation initiatives.

The company reported a net loss of $40.6m, compared to a loss of $70.2m in the year ago period. CEO Gregg Ribatt said: "Our fourth quarter revenues were in line with our expectations while our adjusted gross margin rate improved by approximately 550 basis points versus prior year. This gross margin gain was less than previously anticipated due to currency and channel mix fluctuations and also to certain one-time events, however we are still on track to achieve our medium-term target for gross margins in the low 50% range." Crocs also revealed Ribbatt will step down as CEO but continue in his board role. Andrew Rees, who joined the company in June 2014 as president, will be promoted to president and CEO, effective 1 June.

Consolidated comparable sales were up slightly, following a 4% increase last year. CEO Jay Schottenstein said: "We've made great progress, yet we have much more opportunity across the marketplace. I'm confident that the strength of our brands and focused priorities will enable us to deliver long-term returns to our shareholders." Ross Stores Ross Stores booked fourth-quarter earnings and sales that beat company expectations. Net profit grew 13.8% to US$300.6m from $264.2m last year, while total sales rose 8% to $3.5bn.

Our results continued to benefit from our ability to offer customers great values on a wide assortment of gifts and fashions for the family and the home."For the year ending 3 February, 2018, the company has forecast EPS in the range of $3.02 to $3.15, up 7% to 11% from $2.83 in fiscal 2016.

For the three months ended 31 December, earnings climbed 11.5% to US$28.7m from $25.7m last year. However, the company said overall sales declined "modestly" due primarily to softness in its private label footwear and cold weather accessories businesses. Sales were down 2.3% in the period to $336.4m, compared to $344.3m last year. Gross margin expanded 260 basis points to 38.7% as compared to 36.1%.

Target Corp US retail group Target has booked a drop in earnings and sales in its fourth-quarter on the back on soft store traffic declines and what it calls rapidly-changing consumerbehaviour. For the three months ended 28 January, net earnings tumbled 42.7% from US$1.4bn to $817m. Sales dropped 4.3% to $20.7bn from $21.6bn, reflecting a 1.5% decline in comparable sales combined with the removal of pharmacy and clinic sales from this year's results. Digital channel sales however increased, up by 34% and contributing 1.8 percentage points to comparable sales growth. Gross margin narrowed to 26.9%, compared with 27.9% in the year ago period. The retailer said it will reveal a new financial model later today, designed to position Target for long-term, sustainable growth in "this new era in retail".  "Our fourth quarter results reflect the impact of rapidly-changing consumer behaviour, which drove very strong digital growth but unexpected softness in our stores," said Brian Cornell, chairman and CEO of Target. Foot Locker, Inc US footwear retailer Foot Locker has generated what it says is its seventh consecutive year of "meaningful" sales and profit growth as it revealed higher earnings in its fourth-quarter to US$189m from $158m a year earlier. Gross margin improved to 33.7% of sales from 33.6% a year ago, while total sales climbed 5.3% to $2.11bn. Comparable store sales increased 5%. CEO Richard Johnson, said: "Generating our seventh consecutive year of meaningful sales and profit growth is a strong testament to Foot Locker's solid position at the centre of sneaker culture. Due in part to the change in the cadence of income tax refund check distribution, we are facing a challenging retail sales environment as we enter 2017; however, we believe the strategic initiatives we have in place, coupled with our strong vendor relationships, will enable us to deliver another year of record performance." Nordstrom Upscale US fashion retailer Nordstrom has booked fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations, reflecting what it calls "continuous improvements" to its operating model. For the period ended 28 January, net earnings were up 11.7% to US$201m, from $180m in the year ago period. Net sales were also up, rising 2.4% to $4.2bn compared to $4.1bn last year, while comparable sales slipped by 0.9%. Gross margin, meanwhile, improved 112 basis points, reflecting strong inventory execution in addition to reduced competitive markdowns. For the full year, the company reached record sales of $14.5bn, up from $14.1bn last year. Carter's, Inc Carter's has had what it says was a "strong finish to another record year" as it revealed higher sales and earnings in its fourth-quarter. Net income was up 20% to US$87.1m, while operating margin improved 150 basis points to 14.9%. Net sales, meanwhile, grew 7.8% to reach $67.7m, thanks to revenue growth in nearly every business segment. CEO Michael Casey, said: "Our focus on providing the best value and experience in young children's apparel, extending the reach of our brands, and improving profitability enabled us to achieve our 28th consecutive year of sales growth, improve our profit margins, and increase the return of capital to shareholders. We are forecasting good growth in sales and earnings in 2017." Kohl's Department store retailer Kohl's has posted what it says are "weak" sales results for the fourth quarter, driven by declines in brick and mortar traffic. For the three months ended 28 January, net sales dropped 2.8% to US$6.21bn from $6.39bn in the year-ago period. Net profit was also down, falling 15% to $252m, compared to $296 last year. Gross margin was flat at 33.4%. CEO Kevin Mansell, said: "Sales results were weak for the quarter in total, driven by declines in brick and mortar traffic, and offset somewhat by strength in online demand. We saw improvement in merchandise margin, and our team continued to manage inventory and expenses extremely well. In 2017, we will accelerate our focus on becoming the destination for active and wellness with the launch of Under Armour in early March. We will also extend our efforts on improving our speed to market across all of our proprietary brands into all apparel areas and home."

Licensing sales fell 8% to $87.1m Revenue in the prior year's fourth quarter included approximately $1.3m of licensing revenue from the Badgley Mischka brand, Iconix said, for which there was no comparable revenue this year, due to its sale in the first quarter. The company also made an operating loss of around $385.8m, as compared to a loss of $398.2m in the year ago period. CEO John Haugh said: "2016 was a year of transition for Iconix. Our operating performance was in-line with our guidance. I believe the changes we have made over the past year provide a strong foundation to drive long term growth and shareholder value."  Chico's FAS, Inc Chico's says it is "extremely pleased" with its fourth-quarter results as it moved to a profit thanks to gross margin expansion and execution of its strategic initiatives. Earnings amounted to US$13.5m from a loss of $21.1m a year earlier, while gross margin expanded to 35.5% from 34.4%. Sales, meanwhile, dropped 4.9% to $600.8m as a result of the sale of the firm's Boston Proper direct-to-consumer business last year. Excluding this, sales dropped 2.3%, primarily reflecting a decline in comparable sales of 2.5%, comprised of reduced transaction count and an increase in average dollar sale.

For the 13 weeks ended 28 January, net income grew1.7% to US$678m from $666m in the year ago period. Gross profit margin was down 0.4 percentage points to 28.3%, versus the prior year. Net sales were up 6% to $9.5bn, compared to $9bn last year, while consolidated comparable store sales increased 3%.

              Home E-edition Archives Advertise News Stands Public Records Obituaries Opinion Religion Education Government Events Sports Agriculture Health Business Community steps up when needed Mar 15th, 2017 | By South Platte Sentinel | Category: Opinion While residents of Logan and Phillips Counties continue to recover from a ravaging wildfire that destroyed approximately 32,563 acres last week, this community has much to be grateful for. We have a community of citizens who step up when needed. Much of the effort to battle the fire was driven by volunteer effort. When both the Logan County Wildfire and the Sandhills Fire erupted, agricultural equipment aided in the firefight, cutting lines to form barriers that helped to halt the advance of the fires. We thank both the firefighters and the farmers who worked diligently to keep the fire from spreading and damaging homes and structures. As the Logan County Wildfire blazed, area companies stepped up with water tankers, fuel and fuel trucks, emergency feed rations for animals, and fencing supplies to repair broken fences. CHS/Grainland facilities in Haxtun and Holyoke committed two semi trucks outfitted with tanks that would hold up to 5,600 gallons of water as well as six “bobtail” trucks carrying 3,000 gallons each, and at times two fuel tenders. The company had as many as 25 people helping with the effort. Additionally, upwards of $40,000 of goods and services were contributed to feed firefighters and support staff, and to aid families evacuated during the fire and who have lost their homes. When the Sandhills Fire erupted later in the week and Sterling Fire Department put out a call for nourishment – water, Gatorade and food – the community again stepped up. According to a post on the Sterling Fire Department Facebook page the following businesses and individuals provided donations throughout the week: SRMC, Sunmart, Taco John’s, Wells Fargo, Brew Grit, Adams Bank and Trust, Baja Tacos, Pizza Hut, Pro Till, McDonald’s, Subway, Dominos, Little Caesars Pizza, Jimmy’s Pizza, Walgreens, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Burger King, Sonic, Equitable Savings and Loan, Family Food Market, Aiden and Ellis Kaiser, Shauna Howell, Forrest Hershberger, Tracy and Donna Kerstiens, Shirley Morrison, Austin Neilson, Camille Santomaso, Marian Yoshimoto, Rachel Wright, Melvin Family, Becky Santomaso, Michelle Sharp and Tonya (Eagle Convenient Store). We commend also those who stepped up to help and know that the community will continue to assist in any way possible as recovery efforts continue. We also encourage the community to take this as a warning, as the risk of fires is likely to continue as summer approaches. Gov. John Hickenlooper has proclaimed this week, March 12-18, as Colorado Flood Safety and Wildfire Awareness Week. More information on both of these dangers can be found at http://bit.ly/2mMCHwW. Residents should follow the warning sent out by the Logan County Sheriff’s Office on Monday, March 6, before the fire started, reminding those who are planning to do a controlled burn, to contact the Sterling Emergency Communications Center at 970-522-3512, to inquire about Red Flag Warnings prior to burning. Logan County Ordinance 2009-1 restricts open fires in the unincorporated areas of Logan County on individual Red Flag Warning days where a combination of dry fuels and critical weather conditions support extreme fire behavior. The fine for violating this ordinance is $250 plus a $10 surcharge. LCSO also sent out a reminder later in the week advising residents if you are doing some type of work that could possibly start a fire, please have a water source available. As we enter wildfire season, it’s important the public do its part to prevent them.

The powerful north easter, which came after a stretch of unusually mild winter weather that had people thinking spring was already here, unloaded 1 to 2 feet (30 to 60 centimetres) in many places inland, grounded more than 6 000 flights and knocked out power to nearly a quarter-million customers from Virginia northward. Share this story By the time it reached Massachusetts, it had turned into a blizzard, with near hurricane-force wind gusting over 70 mph along the coast and waves crashing over the seawalls. Boston ended up with 6.6 inches (nearly 17 centimetres) of snow, less than the predictions of up to a foot. It was easily the biggest storm in a merciful winter that had mostly spared the Northeast, and many weren't happy about it. "It's horrible," said retired gumball-machine technician Don Zimmerman, of Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, using a snowblower to clear the sidewalk along his block. "I thought winter was out of here. ... It's a real kick in the rear." While people mostly heeded dire warnings to stay home and off the roads, police said a 16-year-old girl was killed when she lost control of her car on a snowy road and hit a tree in Gilford, New Hampshire. In East Hartford, Connecticut an elderly man died after being struck by a snow plow truck. The storm closed schools in cities big and small, Amtrak suspended service and the post office halted mail delivery. Philadelphia and New York City got anywhere from a few inches of snow to around half a foot before the storm switched over mostly to sleet; forecasters had predicted a foot or more.  In New Jersey, which saw rain or just a little snow in many areas, Gov. Chris Christie called the storm an "underperformer." But officials warned of dangerous ice. Inland areas, meanwhile, got hit hard. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Worcester, Massachusetts, received a foot or more of snow.  The Binghamton, New York, area got over 2 feet, while Vernon, New Jersey, had at least 19 inches (48 centimetres). The storm came just days after the region saw temperatures climb into the 60s, and less than a week before the official start of spring. February, too, was remarkably warm. "The winters seem to be upside down now. January and February are nice and then March and April seem to be more wintry than they were in the past," said Bob Clifford, who ventured out on an early morning grocery run for his family in Altamont, near Albany, New York. His advice: "Just hide inside. Hibernate." In the nation's capital, non-essential federal employees were given the option of reporting three hours late, taking the day off or working from home. The city got less than 2 inches (about 5 centimetres) of snow. A few days ago, workers on Washington's National Mall were making plans to turn on the fountains. "Obviously all that has to come to an abrupt stop until we get all the snow cleared," said Jeff Gowen, the acting facility manager for the National Mall and Memorial Parks. "The cherry blossoms, they're right on the cusp of going into bloom here. I had a feeling this was going to happen." Kelly Erskine, a 28-year-old coffee shop manager from Whitman, Massachusetts, about 25 miles south of Boston, made it almost all the way through the winter without a shovel. She went to Walmart on Tuesday morning to get one. "I live in an apartment complex and they usually take care of the shoveling, but they sent a letter to us and said, 'Expect a lot of snow.' I knew from the letter that I'd have to go out and buy a shovel," she said. As the storm closed in, the National Weather Service used terms like "life-threatening" and urged people to "shelter in place," language that has come to be associated with mass shootings. In the end, the line between snow and rain shifted slightly to the west, sparing some of the Northeast's big cities. Government meteorologists realized by late Monday afternoon that there was a good chance the storm wasn't going to produce the giant big-city snow totals predicted. But they didn't change their forecast for fear people would mistakenly think the storm was no longer dangerous, said Greg Carbin, chief of forecast operations at the Weather Prediction Center. In Pennsylvania, snowplows and state troopers escorted a 23-month-old child in need of a heart transplant 80 miles between hospitals. Gov. Tom Wolf said the youngster made the trip safely. In Narragansett, Rhode Island, high winds buckled a state-owned wind turbine. In New York City, two homes under construction collapsed near the waterfront in Far Rockaway. No injuries were reported. And two ponies broke out of their stables and roamed the snowy streets of Staten Island until an off-duty police officer wrangled them with straps normally used to tow cars and tied them to a lamppost. They were taken back to the stables. "We want to thank our cowboy officer," Mayor Bill de Blasio said. The storm coincided with New Hampshire's Town Meeting Day, a Yankee tradition in which voters in more than 100 communities elect local politicians and set budgets. Some towns postponed because of the snow. But in Hopkinton, a steady stream of voters braved the blustery conditions to make it to the polls. "You know, they're hardy New Englanders, and they're coming to vote," said Debbie Norris, a candidate for the Hopkinton Budget Committee. The flight cancellations included nearly 3 300 in the New York City area alone. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at airports. Laura and Matthew Balderstone of West Yorkshire, England, intended to spend their honeymoon in Florida but found themselves stuck at the Newark, New Jersey, airport and couldn't find a hotel room. "It's better safe than sorry, especially flying. I suppose it's a shame that we can't get another way around this," Matthew Balderstone said. "It's just the way it is, unfortunately."

RUGABER AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) - Americans spent only slightly more last month at retail stores compared with January, a sign of consumer caution despite rising optimism about the economy. The Commerce Department said Wednesday retail sales ticked up a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent in February, after a much bigger gain of 0.6 percent the previous month. January's gain was revised higher. The figures suggest that strong job gains this year, near record-high stock prices and decent pay gains haven't yet lifted spending. But last month's sluggish pace could prove temporary. Economists note that spending was likely held back by delays in tax refund payments. A new law has required tougher scrutiny of a tax credit claimed by lower-income taxpayers. Wal-Mart said last month that the delay had slowed sales at its stores in February. Other retailers have reported similar concerns. Yet tax refunds have started to flow this month, which could trigger a rebound. Economists were also encouraged by the upward revisions to January's sales data, which point to potentially faster growth in the first three months of the year. A separate report showed inflation rose in February and is now comfortably above the Federal Reserve's target of 2 percent. The Fed is expected to announce its third rate hike in 15 months later today. "Inflation is trending gradually higher and underlying retail sales are healthy enough," said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. "Nothing here to suggest the Fed shouldn't raise interest rates at the FOMC meeting that concludes later today." Sales rose in February at furniture stores and home and garden centers. But they fell sharply at electronics and appliance stores. Sales also fell at gasoline stations, though that mostly reflects lower prices. Clothing stores, sporting goods retailers and department stores also all reported lower sales. There are several additional factors that could drive spending higher in the months ahead. Consumer confidence soared to its highest level in more than 15 years in February, according to the Conference Board, a business research group. Hiring and average hourly pay growth have picked up since the new year. Americans' finances are in better shape, with average home prices back to their pre-recession levels in much of the country. Yet the boost in confidence may not be broadly shared. That could limit any spending that might result. For Americans younger than age 35, who are less likely than older age groups to own a home or stocks, confidence actually fell last month. And the consumer confidence data has grown increasingly political in recent years, with Republicans reporting much greater optimism than Democrats. That reverses a pattern that emerged under former President Obama. Retail sales make up about one-third of total consumer spending, with the other two-thirds consisting of health care and other services. Economists closely monitor spending, because it makes up about 70 percent of the economy. Growth has yet to catch up with the recent burst of optimism that has followed Donald Trump's election. The economy expanded at a modest 1.9 percent pace in the final three months of last year. Most economists expect it will grow at roughly a 2 percent pace in the January-March quarter.

Leonid Bershidsky Martin Schulz, the Social Democrat candidate for the German chancellorship. Photo: AFP The man who would depose Angela Merkel as German chancellor also has a global plan: to reverse the onslaught of nationalism and populism. Martin Schulz, the Social Democrat (SPD) candidate for the chancellorship, laid out that vision in Berlin on Monday, speaking to comrades from the Progressive Alliance, an international group uniting socialist parties that is a testament to Germany’s growing global political influence. Formed in 2013 as the SPD’s brainchild, it includes the major European socialist parties as well as political forces from faraway lands, such as India’s Congress and the US Democrats. Even Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton’s former campaign manager, made an appearance this year to talk about politics in the post-truth era. The Berlin convention of the alliance was all about plotting a counterattack. While centre-right parties have appeared too technocratic and out of touch, the left didn’t have that problem, Schulz and the other assembled socialists declared. But they needed to rally behind big ideas in order to gain traction. “The currently predominant pessimism about change and progress comes from years of politics based on an alleged lack of alternatives—and thus consolidates existing power structures,” said a report prepared for the Alliance conference by an international group backed by German foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel and former World Trade Organization director general Pascal Lamy. Schulz’s speech on Monday was all about fixing globalization. Nationalism and protectionism wouldn’t work, he argued, because “no wall can ever be high enough to protect us permanently from global problems”. So socialists must force business to correct the social consequences of globalization. “We need accountability and transparency obligations for companies along the supply chains, the extension of social security systems, and the introduction of wages that can guarantee a standard of living,” Schulz said. The socialists put the blame for the rise of nationalist populism on “neoliberals” whose economic orthodoxy gripped the world when many people thought history was ending. It was these unabashed capitalists who led the world to its current shaky state, creating the refugee problem with “wrong political decisions, environmental changes, failing states, destroyed production conditions and human livelihoods, and conflicts”, the Progressive Alliance report said. All that happened because the world was being governed in the interests of big business, which grew at the expense of everyone else: “Of the world’s 100 biggest ‘economies’, 69 are transnational corporations, Walmart being in 10th place, before Spain, Australia and the Netherlands.” The Progressive Alliance report is essentially a generalized draft programme for socialist parties everywhere. Schulz is already pushing it in Germany—with unexpected success, born perhaps of a public fatigue with Merkel’s 11-year rule. Schulz’s message is about increasing worker protections and reversing a 14-year-old labour market reform, widely credited with giving Germany an economic advantage over France with its less flexible labour rules. An unabashed internationalist, Schulz is against tightening border protections. If Merkel’s decision to open Germany to asylum seekers were indeed her biggest problem, Schulz should fare worse than her—and yet, as the SPD draws even with Merkel’s Christian Democrats or even overtakes them, the far-right Alternative for Germany party keeps losing support. The problem with the model offered by the Progressive Alliance ideologists is that even though it appears to work in Germany, where the far right never had much of a chance, it may be far less attractive elsewhere. The far right in the Netherlands and France talks about taxing the rich and protecting the working man, but also about securing the borders and prioritizing local, not global problems. It’ll be hard to sell them a plan that reduces migration by forcing multinationals to pay better wages overseas. The progressives struggle to offer simple solutions without compromising their internationalist principles, and that is, as ever, their weak point. It’s socialism’s old slogan—“Workers of the world, unite!”—without the all-or-nothing revolutionary implications. In countries with strong populist movements, a less tame version of socialism than the Berlin-minted one is rising. The GreenLeft in the Netherlands, poised to do well in the forthcoming parliamentary election thanks to the dynamic leadership of Jesse Klaver, and the French far left, which led in this election cycle by Benoit Hamon and Jean-Luc Melenchon, feel they need to offer far more ambitious ideas than Schulz does. They are, for example, in favour of a universal income, paid to each citizen to ensure a basic standard of living—an idea that appears exotic to the mainstream. But then, just 100 years ago, an 8-hour workday seemed exotic, too. The overhyped populist tidal wave appears headed for electoral defeats throughout Europe this year. If they do lose, heartened centrists may think their decades-old agenda will be enough to stall a populist takeover of democracies. But the far left may actually have a better understanding of what lies ahead: When voters want major change, they want ambitious plans, not more incrementalism. The universal basic income and other examples of big thinking—such as universal healthcare and free college in the US—may become the rallying cry on the left once the battle resumes.

CDT March 15, 2017 Omar Suleiman (Photo: WFAA) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST IRVING, Texas – Omar Suleiman discovered a disturbing surprise earlier this month. ISIS, the self-proclaims Islamic State known for its extreme ideology and terrorist acts, is calling for his death. Suleiman is a scholar and imam who is extremely active in North Texas, especially so with interfaith activities. He said he learned from a professor friend that he was an ISIS target after a video surfaced online. The next day, the Federal Bureau of Investigation called him. “I can tell you with a completely straight face that I’m not intimidated at all. I don’t think we can be intimidated,” said Suleiman, founder and president of the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research. “We can’t afford to be afraid of any hate groups whether they’re here or abroad.”  The FBI would not comment specifically but told WFAA the agency remains vigilant in protecting public safety and takes all threats seriously. Although the video has been taken down, Suleiman showed us a clip, narrated in Arabic, where he is being called an apostate, or a non-believer. He says the video of him was taken from his interfaith project “An Imam, A Pastor, and A Dream” created with Andrew Stoker at First United Methodist Church in Dallas. The bigger fear, he said, is at home, not thousands of miles away. “I’m more afraid of my wife walking into Walmart than I am of myself because of an ISIS video, to be honest with you,” he said. “It’s literally at any given moment while any Muslim is walking outside, someone could come up to them and start yelling go back home, and assault them.” It’s a sentiment shared by activist and journalist Shaun King who circulated the news of the video on social media, and Alia Salem, executive director of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR). “Yes, it's concerning to have people who identify as representatives of ISIS or what have you to make these claims,” said Salem. “But, frankly speaking, we’ve got a much bigger battle here at home for our safety.” Salem and Suleiman are referring to the recent travel ban targeting Muslims as well as the uptick in hate crimes nationwide, including the burning of a mosque in Victoria, Texas.  “The overwhelming threats I receive to my own person, and what people in the community receive, are from people who identify as white nationalists, white supremacists,” Salem said. “People who are on the extreme side of the issue, who are established bigots in this community.” Threats that create fear. Fear that Suleiman said must be stopped. “Our president has shown up in their propaganda videos quite a bit because he is preaching the message they want to hear, which is you cannot be an American Muslim,” Suleiman said. “Americans of all sorts need to come together and resist this type of bigotry, resist the message from ISIS.” And a message of peace he will continue to spread.

Mariella Moon, @mariella_moon 03.15.17 in Security Comments 541 Shares Share Tweet Share Save alexskopje A 52.2GB corporate database that has leaked online compromises the contact details over 33.7 million employees in the United States. The list includes government workers, most of whom are soldiers and other military personnel from the Department of Defense. According to ZDNet, the database came from business services firm Dun & Bradstreet, which sells it to marketers that send targeted email campaigns. Dun & Bradstreet denies suffering a security breach -- the company says the leaked information matches the type and format it delivers to customers. It could have come from any of its thousands of clients. Troy Hunt, who runs breach notification website Have I Been Pwned, was the one who discovered the leak. After analyzing its contents, he found that they're composed of millions of people's names, their corresponding work email addresses and phone numbers, as well as their companies and job titles. Since it's a database sold to marketers, the leaked details all came from US-based companies and government agencies. Based on Hunt's analysis, here are the top ten entities in the list, along with the number of affected employees: 1. Department of Defense: 101,013 2. United States Postal Service: 88,153 3. AT&T: 6,7382 4. Wal-Mart: 55,421 5. CVS: 40,739 6. The Ohio State University: 38,705 7. Citigroup: 35,292 8. Wells Fargo Bank, National Association: 34,928 9. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals : 34,805 10. International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation: 33,412 While the database doesn't contain more sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or SSNs, Hunt says it's an "absolute goldmine for [targeted] phishing." He told ZDNet: "From this data, you can piece together organizational structures and tailor messaging to create an air of authenticity and that's something that's attractive to crooks and nation-state actors alike." Hunt has already uploaded the contents of the database on Have I Been Pwned, so you can check if your details have been compromised anytime.

Richmond’s resident ad giant has announced another round of layoffs – the second time it has trimmed its workforce in six months. The Martin Agency informed its staff Tuesday it is laying off 21 employees – 16 from its Shockoe Slip headquarters and five from its New York office. The reduction represents 4 percent of the company’s workforce, which now stands at 413 in Richmond and 450 companywide, including offices in New York and London. Spokesman Dean Jarrett said the layoffs are part of an agency restructuring “designed to respond to the changing needs of our clients.” He said ongoing internal changes would range from how employees work together in teams, to how they are organized and where they are located within the office. “We think that’s going to help not only with our agility and making us more efficient, but engage more effectively with our clients’ consumers and be more responsive as the world picks up speed and moves faster and faster,” Jarrett said. He said the layoffs, first reported by the Times-Dispatch, were not prompted by any particular change in accounts or client work. The agency’s last round of layoffs – 29 employees last September – was attributed to the firm losing the Walmart account, which ended that July after nearly a decade. “This was really more about the restructuring and the changes we’re going to make in how we work and how we serve all of our clients moving forward,” Jarrett said. Martin’s website lists 31 current clients, including Geico, Discover Card, Land O’Lakes, Oreo, Sabra, Stoli and Tic Tac. The agency is owned by Interpublic Group, a publicly traded holding company. Jarrett said the company does not release revenue or profit numbers specific to Martin.

Some reports cover stocks to buy, and others cover stocks to sell or avoid. Below is a list of Wall Streets top analysts upgrades, downgrades and initiations for Wednesday, as follows: Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:OXY) analysts raised to Outperform from Neutral at Credit Suisse, and the price target was raised to 79 from 77. Occidental has a consensus analyst target price of 75.00, and it has a 52-wk trading range of 61.01 – 78.48. Note: Credit Suisse noted that Occidental is attractively valued and that its good inventory of low-cost Permian Basin reserves is not reflected in the valuation. Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL) reiterated as Buy with a 48 price target at Merrill Lynch. This was just a day after a more cautious call from a competing firm. Merrill Lynch sees Oracle’s business poised for an inflection point to potentially deliver mid-single-digit software revenue growth and operating income going forward. Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) analysts raised to Buy from Neutral with a 128 price target at Guggenheim. The consensus price target is 116.69, and the 52-wk range is 90.32 – 111.99. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is rated as Buy and added to the prized US 1 List at Merrill Lynch. Despite retail issues, the firm believes that Wal-Mart’s focus on its core US strategy is working. The firm sees e-Commerce sales momentum continuing in FY 2018.

My Money Blog Early Retirement Investing Guide Money Saving Tips Credit Card Rewards Advertising Disclosure More Experience = Less Complexity? March 14, 2017 By Jonathan Ping 6 Comments When we had our first child, it seems like we were prepared for the apocalypse whenever we stepped out the door. Below is a visualization taken from Pinterest, while we actually had this $60 SkipHop diaper bag filled to the brim. Compare that with what I grabbed as my “diaper bag” for our youngest baby this morning: If I am going to be out for no more than a few hours, this is all I really need. – 99 cent reusable grocery bag – butt everything wipes – two diapers – poop bags (also used for dogs) – food/drink (if breast milk unavailable) If you aren’t experienced, then you want to be prepared for every possible situation. Over time, you realize what you really need and leave everything else at home. Instead of more stuff, you are instead mentally prepared with the various improvisations you can perform in unexpected situations. (I also keep a bag in the car with an extra change of clothes for everyone.) A similar example is packing luggage. What used to just be for “backpackers” is now for everyone. Websites about packing light abound. My first few trips, I packed myself a huge, cheap Wal-Mart suitcase at maximum-weight along with another maximum-size carry-on. Something like this: After many flights (and an experience with delayed luggage), like many others I found myself with just a carry-on travel backpack for a month-long trip (or even longer). I feel like this trend should apply to investing as well, but it seems like the ultra-wealthy tend to have a more complex mix of investments. Perhaps the very wealthy like to spread their money across various asset classes like real estate, private equity, and hedge funds because it reduces the chance of catastrophic loss. For example, sometimes I want to buy a rental property as it seems it would offer additional diversification to a stock and bond portfolio, but I really don’t want to deal with bad tenants or mediocre property managers. I do like the idea of simply transferring over some of my bond interest payments and stock dividends to my checking account every month in retirement. However, a part of me is uncomfortable having so much of my net worth in investments where the only tangible evidence is paper and ink via monthly statements. Share this: Tweet Pocket More Print Share on Tumblr Email Related Filed Under: Simple Living Last updated: March 14, 2017 Comments Revanche @ A Gai Shan Life says: March 15, 2017 at 12:02 am I had a hard time believing my friends on their 4th and 5th that traveling with the kids could be that simple, but I’m starting to come around on the idea ourselves. We toss the diaper pack, the clothes pack, and a food / drink pack in a tote and are good to go. It’d be less complicated than that but we just went out for a one hour errand and got stuck in traffic for hours, getting home after four hours, so we’re still leaving the house a little over prepared. No one wants to face our kid without enough snacks in a bad traffic situation! ? I have the same issues with wanting to simplify our finances but I need to spread out risk across investments too. Right now I manage our tax-deferred retirement investing, a brokerage account, and a rental property but it feels like any major shifts in the economy that significantly impacts the market will likewise bring down our entire portfolio because it’s all connected. Not sure how to crack that nut, yet! Reply Jonathan Ping says: March 15, 2017 at 11:31 am Snacks are definitely key! We love the Thermos Funtainers that can keep milk (or any liquid) cold all day long (and take quite a lickin’ and keep on tickin’). Reply Revanche @ A Gai Shan Life says: March 15, 2017 at 10:47 pm Oh that’s good to know they’re really sturdy! I see tons of kids with them but hadn’t done my research yet. Thanks 🙂 Reply JR says: March 15, 2017 at 10:48 am Understand you wanting to spread the risk across real estate for the tangible benefit and increased diversification but dealing with bad tenants and mediocre property managers is a real risk. Enjoy not having to deal with it. Index funds don’t need new roofs. Reply Frugal Professor says: March 15, 2017 at 2:05 pm As I get older, I’m drawn more and more to minimalism. It’s the ultimate form of sophistication. Only bring what you need. Only buy the house that you need. Anything in excess of what you need is a waste of money and time. Reply Steve says: March 15, 2017 at 4:47 pm I agree with Frugal Professor as I’m down that path also. I found less stuff=less headaches Reply Speak Your Mind Cancel reply Name * Email * Website three  ×  three  =  Notify me of follow-up comments by email. Notify me of new posts by email.

He was born June 5, 1932, in Bellows Falls, the son of Wallace J. and Katherine (Quinn) Primeau and had been a Claremont resident since 1973. “Beep” was a U.S. Army veteran of the Korean War. He was a call fireman for both the Bellows Falls Fire Department and the Claremont Fire Department. “Beep” was the first man from Bellows Falls to hike 50 miles at the time of President Kennedy’s physical fitness program, hiking from Hanover, New Hampshire to Bellows Falls in 14 1/2 hours. He had been employed as the steward at American Legion Post #29. He later worked for Holson-Burnes for 11 years. He then worked at Wal-Mart in Claremont. He was the widow of Beverly (Tatro) Primeau, who died Sept. 15, 2003. Members of his family include two stepsons, Donald Pellerin and Mark Pellerin; several nieces and nephews; as well as many friends that he had made over the years. He was predeceased by a brother, Malcolm Primeau; four sisters, Katherine Aquistapace, Marjorie Kendall, Agnes Kendall and Rita Beam. A memorial service will be held at 12 p.m. Saturday, March 18, at Roy Funeral Home, 93 Sullivan St., in Claremont, NH with the Rev. Mr. Paul Boucher of St. Mary Parish, officiating.

An Arkansas college student who moonlights as a magician showed off his juggling skills after he was pulled over for a broken brake light, and the act was captured on an officer’s body camera and police cruiser video. University of Central Arkansas police pulled over 21-year-old Blayk Puckett recently in Conway, about 25 miles northwest of Little Rock. Police say Puckett was driving slowly and officers suspected that he may have been under the influence. UCA police spokesman Michael Hopper says the officers quickly saw that Puckett was sober and they agreed to give him a warning before Puckett revealed he was a magician. Puckett, whose license plate read JUGGLER, volunteered to juggle some bowling pins. He quipped: “This is the new sobriety test in Conway.” Not-so-sweet escape: Gelato leads police to suspect CHARLESTON, S.C. Police in South Carolina were able to nab a burglary suspect when they linked gelato in his possession to the same Italian-style ice cream that had been stolen from a store. The Post and Courier of Charleston reported that Charleston police responded to a report of a string of vandalisms March 8. Officers found shattered glass at eight buildings on the street and four more on a street nearby. Around 1 a.m., police found 20-year-old Robert Corbit Hodges nearby. He was drunk, bleeding and carrying a container of gelato. Investigators determined the gelato had been taken from Burbages Grocery, one of the targeted businesses. Hodges was arrested on charges of second-degree burglary and public intoxication. It’s unclear if he has an attorney. Dead shark found in cart in store parking lot ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. Authorities are mystified as to why a 5-foot-long dead shark was left in the parking lot of a northeast Florida Wal-Mart just days before another dead shark was found nearby. The St. Augustine Record reported St. Johns County deputy sheriffs were called to the store parking lot last week after the shark was found in a shopping cart. Deputies talked to the owner of an RV parked nearby and learned that the RV owner had woken to find the shark on his vehicle’s hood. The owner said he then put it in the cart. The sheriff’s office says days later they were called to driveway in Vilano Beach and found another dead shark. The deputies called in the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission to dispose of the sharks.

Caption(Mark Lennihan) A crew of snow shovelers work as a snowstorm sweeps through Times Square, Tuesday, March 14, 2017, in New York. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) By COLLEEN LONG and DENISE LAVOIE - The Associated Press Philadelphia and New York City got anywhere from a few inches of snow to around half a foot before the storm switched over mostly to sleet; forecasters had predicted a foot or more. In New Jersey, which saw rain or just a little snow in many areas, Gov. Chris Christie called the storm an “underperformer.” But officials warned of dangerous ice. Inland areas, meanwhile, got hit hard. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Worcester, Massachusetts, received a foot or more of snow. The Binghamton, New York, area got more than 2 feet, while Vernon, New Jersey, had at least 19 inches. The storm came just days after the region saw temperatures climb into the 60s, and less than a week before the official start of spring. February, too, was warm. “The winters seem to be upside down now. January and February are nice and then March and April seem to be more wintry than they were in the past,” said Bob Clifford, who ventured out on an early morning grocery run for his family in Altamont, near Albany, New York. His advice: “Just hide inside. Hibernate.” In the nation’s capital, nonessential federal employees were given the option of reporting three hours late, taking the day off or working from home. The city got less than 2 inches of snow. A few days ago, workers on Washington’s National Mall were making plans to turn on the fountains. “Obviously all that has to come to an abrupt stop until we get all the snow cleared,” said Jeff Gowen, the acting facility manager for the National Mall and Memorial Parks. “The cherry blossoms, they’re right on the cusp of going into bloom here. I had a feeling this was going to happen.” Kelly Erskine, a 28-year-old coffee shop manager from Whitman, Massachusetts, about 25 miles south of Boston, made it almost all the way through the winter without a shovel. She went to Wal-Mart on Tuesday morning to get one. “I live in an apartment complex and they usually take care of the shoveling, but they sent a letter to us and said, ‘Expect a lot of snow.’ I knew from the letter that I’d have to go out and buy a shovel,” she said. As the storm closed in, the National Weather Service used terms like “life-threatening” and urged people to “shelter in place,” language that has come to be associated with mass shootings. In the end, the line between snow and rain shifted slightly to the west, sparing some of the Northeast’s big cities. Government meteorologists realized by late Monday afternoon that there was a good chance the storm wasn’t going to produce the giant big-city snow totals predicted. But they didn’t change their forecast for fear people would mistakenly think the storm was no longer dangerous, said Greg Carbin, chief of forecast operations at the Weather Prediction Center. In Pennsylvania, snowplows and state troopers escorted a 23-month-old child in need of a heart transplant 80 miles between hospitals. Gov. Tom Wolf said the youngster made the trip safely. In Narragansett, Rhode Island, high winds buckled a state-owned wind turbine. In New York City, two homes under construction collapsed near the waterfront in Far Rockaway. No injuries were reported. And two ponies broke out of their stables and roamed the snowy streets of Staten Island until an off-duty police officer wrangled them with straps normally used to tow cars and tied them to a lamppost. They were taken back to the stables. “We want to thank our cowboy officer,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said. The storm coincided with New Hampshire’s Town Meeting Day, a Yankee tradition in which voters in more than 100 communities elect local politicians and set budgets. Some towns postponed because of the snow. But in Hopkinton, a steady stream of voters braved the blustery conditions to make it to the polls. “You know, they’re hardy New Englanders, and they’re coming to vote,” said Debbie Norris, a candidate for the Hopkinton Budget Committee. The flight cancellations included nearly 3,300 in the New York City area alone. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at airports. Laura and Matthew Balderstone of West Yorkshire, England, intended to spend their honeymoon in Florida but found themselves stuck at the Newark, New Jersey, airport and couldn’t find a hotel room. “It’s better safe than sorry, especially flying. I suppose it’s a shame that we can’t get another way around this,” Matthew Balderstone said. “It’s just the way it is, unfortunately.” Previous Page|1|2|Next Page| Comments Get breaking and town-specific news sent to your phone.

NEW YORK >> A blustery late-season storm plastered the Northeast with sleet and snow today, paralyzing much of the Washington-to-Boston corridor but falling well short of the predicted snow totals in New York, Boston and Philadelphia. The powerful nor’easter, which came after a stretch of unusually mild winter weather that had people thinking spring was already here, unloaded 1 to 2 feet in many places inland, grounded more than 6,000 flights and knocked out power to nearly a quarter-million customers from Virginia northward. By the time it reached Massachusetts, it had turned into a blizzard, with near hurricane-force wind gusting over 70 mph along the coast and waves crashing over the seawalls. Boston ended up with 6.6 inches of snow, less than the predictions of up to a foot. It was easily the biggest storm in a merciful winter that had mostly spared the Northeast, and many weren’t happy about it. “It’s horrible,” said retired gumball-machine technician Don Zimmerman, of Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, using a snowblower to clear the sidewalk along his block. “I thought winter was out of here. … It’s a real kick in the rear.” While people mostly heeded dire warnings to stay home and off the roads, police said a 16-year-old girl was killed when she lost control of her car on a snowy road and hit a tree in Gilford, New Hampshire. In East Hartford, Connecticut an elderly man died after being struck by a snow plow truck. The storm closed schools in cities big and small, Amtrak suspended service and the post office halted mail delivery. Philadelphia and New York City got anywhere from a few inches of snow to around half a foot before the storm switched over mostly to sleet; forecasters had predicted a foot or more. In New Jersey, which saw rain or just a little snow in many areas, Gov. Chris Christie called the storm an “underperformer.” But officials warned of dangerous ice. Inland areas, meanwhile, got hit hard. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Worcester, Massachusetts, received a foot or more of snow. The Binghamton, New York, area got over 2 feet, while Vernon, New Jersey, had at least 19 inches. The storm came just days after the region saw temperatures climb into the 60s, and less than a week before the official start of spring. February, too, was remarkably warm. “The winters seem to be upside down now.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Business Markets US stocks close lower as energy shares drag Investors are cautious ahead of a likely interest rate hike announcement on Wednesday (15 March). By Nicole Rojas March 15, 2017 02:33 GMT A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York on 6 March 2017REUTERS/Brendan McDermid US stocks ended lower on Tuesday (14 March) as energy stocks fell ahead of a likely interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. US crude oil dropped more than 1% and the energy sector was the worst performing S&P 500 sector. The S&P 500 index dropped 8.02 points, or 0.3%, to settle at 2,365.45. The energy sector led 10 of the 11 main sectors down, with materials and industrials settling down 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively. The consumer discretionary sector was the only gainer, ending up less than 0.1%. According to MarketWatch, crude oil prices dropped 1.4% to settle at $47.72 a barrel after an OPEC report revealed production in Saudi Arabia is rising. "The continued drop in oil has got stocks rolling over again," Peter Coleman, head trader at Convvergex, told CNBC. "A little out of stocks into bonds." The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 44.11 points, or 0.2%, to end at 20,837.37. Chevron Corp and General Electric Co shares were the lead decliners, falling 1.8% and 1.1% respectively. CNBC reported that shares of Walt Disney and Wal-Mart contributed to gains. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite declined 18.97 points, or 0.3%, to close at 5,856.82. MarketWatch noted that the main indexes were only a few percentage points below their all-time highs. The Federal Open Market Committee kicked off its two-day meeting on Tuesday (14 March) and is expected to announce a rate increase after the meeting concludes on Wednesday (15 March). The market sees a 93% chance that the Fed will vote in favour of a rate hike, according to data from the CME Group. "What they have following that [rate hike], I think, is what's making people nervous," JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, told CNBC. "What will be their new targets?" The Fed is expected to vote for three rate increases this year. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield dropped to 2.595%, while the shorter-term 2-year yield briefly ticked higher at 1.38%. The US dollar index rose 0.4%, with the euro near $1.061 and the yen around 114.7 yen against the greenback. According to MarketWatch, the British pound marked its lowest level against the dollar since the start of this year, trading near $1.2152. Gold prices dropped $0.50 to settle at $1,202.60 an ounce.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Search continues: Family, community keep their 'Lights on for Noah' as authorities continuously comb aqueduct Tuesday Mar 14, 2017 at 5:29 PM Mar 14, 2017 at 5:36 PM Jose Quintero Staff Writer @dd_jquintero Paola Baker Staff Writer @DP_PaolaBaker HESPERIA — Thursday marks two weeks since the tragic collision that claimed the lives of a Hesperia woman and two of her children, and authorities have yet to recover the body of Noah Abbott. The 2-year-old has been missing and presumed dead since the single-vehicle crash that claimed the lives of his brother Jeremiah Abbott, 3, and their mother Christina Eileen Estrada, 31, on March 2, when their red Volkswagen convertible went through a fence on Main Street and plunged into the California Aqueduct. San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department officials said Tuesday that deputies and volunteers from the Hesperia Sheriff’s Station continue monitoring the recovery area along the aqueduct. Sheriff’s personnel and volunteers, along with community members and aqueduct employees, have monitored a 7-mile stretch of the California Aqueduct, from the scene of the crash to south of a pump station, south of Summit Valley Road. A glimmer of hope was sparked Tuesday afternoon when Sheriff’s Dispatch received a report of “something gray” seen floating in the aqueduct near Mesquite Street around 3 p.m. However, Hesperia Sheriff’s Station spokeswoman Jackie Chambers told the Daily Press the object appeared to be debris, and nothing else was found during an aerial check. As of Tuesday, Sheriff's officials say there are no updates to their ongoing investigation into the crash. “Due to the nature and severity of the collision, a time frame for the completion of the investigation cannot be established,” Chambers said. Noah's brother Elijah Estrada, 10, was the lone survivor of the crash. Elijah was pulled from the water by Dustin and Rod DeYoung, who were driving by when they saw the Volkswagen crash into the aqueduct. Elijah was transported to Loma Linda University Medical Center and suffered a gash on his head, authorities said, while Estrada was pronounced dead at the scene after emergency personnel pulled her from the water. Emergency personnel also pulled Jeremiah from the water and transported him to Desert Valley Hospital. He was pronounced dead in the emergency department. Moments before heading to the California Aqueduct to begin a community-organized sight search earlier this month, family members told the Daily Press that Noah was not strapped in a carseat during the crash. The Daily Press also learned Noah was wearing a Mickey Mouse top, jeans and tennis shoes the day of the crash. Dozens of people met in the parking lot of Wal-Mart in Hesperia to take part in a sight search for Noah's body last week. The search was organized by several residents who have been following the story waiting to hear if "baby Noah" had been found. The sight search took several large groups of people to various points along the aqueduct. The organizers thought of the idea after authorities concluded the search due to zero visibility and unsafe water conditions for Sheriff’s dive team members. The dive team has been on standby in the event Noah’s body is found in the California Aqueduct, authorities said. They’ve searched the aqueduct for Noah from an area just north of the crash scene to roughly two miles south of Main Street. Dive team members searched the aqueduct for Noah the night of the crash and also two days after. But their efforts were suspended due to darkness and low visibility. The search resumed the morning after the crash when authorities stopped the flow of a portion of the California Aqueduct. Despite the tragedy, family members refuse to lose hope that Noah will soon be found. Siblings, cousins, and friends laughed and cried together as they reminisced about the Hesperia mother and her two boys and pledged to keep their “lights on for Noah” during a candlelight vigil last Friday. “Though my physical body is in pain, my spirit is ecstatic, because I know Christina’s in paradise surrounded by her boys — all three of them — and I’ll see her again soon,” Estrada’s brother, Johnny Estrada, said. A celebration of life for Estrada and the Abbott boys will be held at Abundant Living Family Church, located at 17555 Mauna Loa Street, at 11 a.m. Friday. The public is invited to attend.

By richard kadzis • Mar 15, 2017 TweetShareGoogle+Email Credit Richard Kadzis ‘In his annual state of the city address, Mayor Ken Miyagishima reported last month that Las Cruces is in good shape. “The state of the city is strong,” he proclaimed. His remarks focused mainly on downtown redevelopment, including the brand-new civic plaza on Main Street. The mayor also cited the conversion of old city hall into space for the federal courts and some downtown redevelopment projects to add more entertainment and restaurants as positive steps. And, he reminded us of the important economic base provided by institutions like NMSU and White Sands Missile Range. No doubt, these are big pluses, but we need more. The fact is, compared to many other communities, Las Cruces has a lot of work left to do, especially from an economic development standpoint. Tip of the Iceberg The mayor overlooked some deep-seated issues that, until addressed and improved, will continue to hold us back. One is per capita income, which the US Census reports was $20,000 annually in 2015, the latest figures available. That is more than $4,000 lower the New Mexico state average for per capita income. Even more troubling, the city’s average per capita earnings trail the national average by nearly $10,000. The U.S. average was just under $30,000 in 2015. The mayor pointed to the city’s strong health care and service sector, yet there is a distinct shortage of physicians struggling to keep up with the growing demand of a fast-growing retirement population. Another pressing challenge he ignored: the Las Cruces brain drain of young talent to other states and cities with more career jobs and opportunities to offer, despite the presence of our university, the military and the aero-space companies. There simply aren’t enough meaningful jobs being created here to keep the young talent here. SITEL Corporation’s decision to leave Las Cruces is the tip of that iceberg. What does it say when a city cannot retain its higher-quality existing industry base? For one, it says to younger career-seekers, there aren’t a lot of higher-paying jobs in Las Cruces, so I’d better look somewhere else for a career. For another, it says Las Cruces and Dona Ana County urgently need a new plan, not only to retain existing industry but to attract new companies. For that matter, can anyone tell me what Fortune 500 companies are operating here? Is there a list of major employers we can share with younger people looking to go elsewhere? Don’t basic information resources like these imply planning and vision? Is there a formal vision for the pursuit of the future, some idea of our future economic state that serves as a cornerstone for long-term strategic plan to generate more corporate and government investment, alongside the creation of meaningful jobs and the inevitable expansion of the local tax base? Symptoms of Distress When I drive through the so-called Mesquite Overlay and see the city’s historic district pocked with vacant lots, shuttered houses and financially distressed, abandoned properties, I come away with the feeling that the city has no formal plan for community development. When I pass by the long-abandoned Las Cruces Country Club, I wonder, where is the vision for a new signature development of some kind? It’s in the hands of a private developer not a public-private sector partnership. Instead of treating it as a strategic asset, it lies fallow, an eyesore of a gateway property, all 110 acres. The developer, Bob Pofhal, insists that construction will start soon on a new hospital facility with $100-million in financing now in hand. After years of neglect and negative impact for the residents of the old country club neighborhood, let’s hope they break ground soon. If it doesn’t happen, what comes next? More waiting? Everyone appears to be stuck on that idea to the detriment of other options. Inaction implies a lack of key relationships, whether with the Chamber of Commerce, the state department of Economic Development, and corporate clients like Amazon, Target, WalMart, FedEx, UPS, Google and other Fortune 500 players. Considering the empty tract’s proximity to I-10, I-25 and US-70, the old Country Club would make a great logistics center – a clean and non-intrusive series of office-warehouses for large or small companies. In his state of the city remarks, the mayor also praised the Downtown Las Cruces Partnership. Perhaps it’s the right channel to help us design for public consensus, giving the homeowners who live next to the dust bowl a voice in the outcome of whatever solution is best for the old golf course. If we only had a plan to make all this happen by convening all key stakeholders and constituencies in pursuit of the future, we could take a giant step forward.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 March 2017 by Military News Investing in EV Infrastructure: Where the Money Is Going Last year, 159,139 electric vehicles were sold in the U.S., according to Inside EVs , but that’s just scratching the surface of the industry’s potential. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) plans to build 500,000 EVs in 2018 and General Motors (NYSE: GM) just launched its first big bet on EVs in the Chevy Bolt, which will test the size of the market. With new cars from Nissan , Porsche, VW , Volvo, and many others, there looks to be an EV boom on the horizon. But the size of that boom is currently unknown. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (which typically underestimates new technologies) predicts that annual EV and plug-in EV sales will be 1.3 million by 2025 and that 7.5 million EVs will be on the road by then. Meanwhile, GTM Research estimates that a total of 11.4 million EVs will be on the road in the U.S. by 2025 and Bloomberg New Energy Finance thinks 35% of all new vehicles sold in 2040 will be electric. We know that the EV market will be big and that, given the scale of the numbers above and the speed of growth, EV charging infrastructure will become increasingly important across the country. That presents an opportunity for the companies building out these charging capabilities. Image source: Getty Images. The chargers themselves could be big business As EVs become more common, someone has to provide millions of chargers for personal and public use. Aerovironment (NASDAQ: AVAV) has taken a leading position in the charger market with partnerships with Volvo, Nissan, Ford , and others. The company has also released charging plans and session prices for Level 2 (12-26 miles of charge per hour) and fast charging (40 miles of charge in 10 minutes) on the West Coast, where it is building out a network. In its most recent quarter, electric charging product sales jumped 74% to $11.3 million, a small but growing base for a small company to build on. General Electric (NYSE: GE) is also moving into the market, selling home chargers and public charging options. As it’s a major electricity component supplier, this is an adjacent market it can enter with little risk, and I would expect to see GE’s charger revenue grow as the market grows. Of course, there’s Tesla’s charging infrastructure as well. Tesla sells most of its own charging components to customers, and as it’s the biggest EV company, it’s a big business. But the proprietary charging technology it has bet on may end up eventually walling it off from competitors. How chargers get built What’s less known is who will build the charger infrastructure and how it will be paid for. Tesla’s Supercharger network has been built out entirely by Tesla for the use of its own customers. It’s been free for years, but now new Model S and Model X customers will get 400 kWh of supercharging free and then pay a fee for charging based on local electricity costs. Competing auto manufacturers haven’t shown much interest in building out their own networks and will most likely let someone else build chargers. Image source: Getty Images. Utilities have shown some interest in chargers being a growth opportunity. In California, San Diego Gas & Electric is building 3,500 utility-owned chargers for $45 million, Southern California Edison is building 1,500 host-owned chargers for $22 million, and Pacific Gas & Electric is building the infrastructure behind 7,500 chargers in a utility-private investor partnership. The question here is whether or not utilities should be able to build chargers under their monopoly power and therefore rate-base the cost to all consumers, whether they own an electric vehicle or not. In theory, a utility’s low cost of capital could help build out charger networks more quickly, although keeping utilities out of the market may bring in more innovative business models from private companies. The third option is third-party charging networks. NRG Energy (NYSE: NRG)  tried to get into this business but sold off EVgo earlier this year to an investment firm that may be able to grow the network more effectively. The national network now counts BMW , Ford, and Nissan as partners, and its early mover status may be helpful long term. ChargePoint is the nation’s largest charging network, aggregating local EV charging stations into a national network. Blink is another company building a large network, which is currently about 4,000 stations. EV charging will be big but still faces risks What’s unique here is that there are three distinct business models colliding in EV charging, and we don’t know which one will win long term. My money would be on third-party networks eventually becoming victorious because of their national scope and ability to provide different charging technologies. And if they do, these (mostly private) networks and the companies that build the chargers will be the big winners for investors. What we do know is that with millions of EVs expected to hit the road in the next decade, this is a big opportunity for companies that can get their business model right. 10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The court had agreed to consider the constitutionality of Proposition 206 [text, PDF] last month. The institution of this law raises minimum wage from $8.05 to $10 an hour. By 2020, the minimum wage will increase to $12 an hour as a voter-approved law. This law also requires employers to provide at least three days of paid leave for their workers annually. Business groups who contested Proposition 206 argued it violated a constitutional provision that any ballot measure requiring state spending must also include a source of revenue. The court held a hearing on the measure last week but rejected the challenge [Capitol Media Services report] Tuesday without comment. Minimum wage and employment issues continues to be a controversial issue in the US. The US has not seen an increase [Reuters report] in federal minimum wage since 2009. In the absence of a federal increase, many states have responded by raising their own minimum wages. Voters in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and Washington all approved minimum wage increase initiatives [JURIST report] in November, while South Dakota rejected a measure to lower the minimum wage. In January the Supreme Court of Missouri [official website] ruled [JURIST report] that the Kansas City Board of Commissioners [official website] must place a minimum wage proposal on the upcoming ballot. The same month the Kentucky legislature passed [JURIST report] the right-to-work legislation. In March the Missouri Supreme Court [official website] ruled [JURIST report] that St. Louis may raise its minimum wage next year. In January a federal judge refused [JURIST report] to force Wal-Mart to pay $80 million in back pay. The same month the US Department of Labor [official website] filed [JURIST report] a lawsuit against Oracle America, Inc. alleging it had a systemic practice of paying Caucasian male workers more than other works in the same job position.

The judge said Sawyer was different in part because “her actions as anchor, which limits her involvement in doing research,” were not sufficient to establish defamation. Gering did not rule on the case’s merits. Reuters obtained a transcript of the Feb. 8 hearing on March 14. The decision was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal. “We are pleased that the court dismissed all claims against Diane Sawyer,” ABC said in a statement. “We welcome the opportunity to defend the ABC News reports at trial and are confident that we will ultimately prevail.” BPI’s lawyer, J. Erik Connolly, said his client looks forward to proving how ABC “engaged in a disinformation campaign against a company that produces safe and nutritious beef, leading to billions of dollars in damages and hundreds of lost jobs.” A jury trial scheduled for June 5 could last eight weeks. Lean, finely textured beef is made from beef chunks, including trimmings, and exposed to tiny bursts of ammonium hydroxide to kill bacteria. BPI said ABC’s reports in March and April 2012 implied that the South Dakota-based company’s product was not safe, not nutritious and not even meat. The network has called BPI’s lawsuit an attempt to chill media coverage of the industry and inhibit free speech. BPI has claimed up to $1.9 billion of damages, which could be tripled to $5.7 billion under South Dakota’s Agricultural Food Products Disparagement Act. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has called BPI’s product safe. But some retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., stopped selling ground beef containing it after the ABC reports. Several other defendants were previously dismissed from the case, including a former Agriculture Department microbiologist said to have coined “pink slime” in a 2002 email. The case is Beef Products Inc et al v. American Broadcasting Cos et al, First Judicial Circuit Court of South Dakota, Union County, No. 12-292.

San Diego, CA (PRWEB) March 15, 2017 Today, XY- The Findables Company announced its switch from StartEngine to directly raising capital from investors through online equity crowdfunding. Using Regulation A + of the 2012 Jumpstart Our Business Start-ups (JOBS) Act, XY Findables seeks investments from accredited and non-accredited investors alike. XY Findables originally began their equity campaign on StartEngine.com but found that after a 12-month contract, they were unable to reach their desired investor audience. XY Findables decided to bring their investment campaign in-house. In the six weeks since XY Findables began directly managing their online equity campaign, the company has seen a five-fold increase of investors. Additionally, XY Findables is fully integrating the customer and investor experience with the upcoming launch of their online customer/investor portal. In just a few weeks, users and investors alike will be able to log on to their personalized my.xyfindit.com account to track their XY GPS and Bluetooth LE units, access the help center, view their investment history, and use their Insider Club benefits. CEO Arie Trouw explains it was only natural for XY Findables to continue its growth with a direct Regulation A+ offering and web-portal upgrade. “We are one of the first companies to directly manage a Regulation A+ campaign. Bringing our equity crowdfunding in-house allows us to speak directly to our user-investors. No one can give us better feedback or support. This is the future for consumer-facing companies: the democratization of investment.” XY Findables is selling Class A Common stock at $1 per share at a minimum investment of 350 shares. Prospective investors can read further about the company at xyfindables.com/invest. Questions can also be directed to investor-relations(at)xyfindables.com.

Tiffany shares have risen almost 15% this year. "With a strong brand that has supported pricing power historically coupled with recent and future talent upgrades, we believe shares can still rise from here," said a team of Jefferies analysts led by Randal J. Konik. Their investment outlook was based on four catalysts. Fashion jewelry comeback Tiffany is succeeding in its efforts to revive customer interest in fashion jewelry. "The reinvigoration of fashion jewelry is underway, visible to us (and consumers), and beginning to show in the numbers," they said. "Last quarter, fashion jewelry posted a modest increase year-over-year and sterling silver stabilized with sales up slightly due to the popularity of the Return to Tiffany Love Collection." Jefferies Tourism growth Tourists have long been a major source of sales for Tiffany, accounting for about 25% of total US sales and 40% of sales in its flagship New York store. "While challenges exist on the tourism front, travel and spending data indicate trends are stabilizing or improving," Jefferies said. "Total international passengers traveling to the US increased +1.0% y/y for the most recent fiscal quarter measured." Jefferies Pricing power Despite competition, Tiffany has built a strong brand with enough pricing power to protect margins. "With a higher-income consumer that is particularly strong given the recent rise in equity markets and well-positioned with the potential for lower personal income taxes," Jefferies said, "we believe TIF is one of a few retailers under our coverage with clear pricing power." Jefferies Growing market share Tiffany has grown its international market share, and looks set to maintain its growth. "Tiffany has used its strong brand name to gain share in the market," they said. "Given the market that Tiffany operates in, along with a strong brand that affords significant pricing power, the company is not susceptible to Amazon or Walmart." Jefferies Finally, Jefferies said Tiffany also trades below peers both on a P/E and EV/EBITDA basis. The company is expected to release its next quarterly earnings report on Friday. Previously, it reported a worldwide drop in comparable store sales of 2%, owing to exchange rate effects, during the holiday season of the two months ending December 31, 2016.

The impact of the global palm oil industry on human rights and deforestation has inspired many NGOs to push multinational companies to become far more transparent about their operations and supply chains. The evidence suggests that the work of NGOs including Greenpeace and the Rainforest Action Network are showing results. According to a report another environmental group, Forest Trends, released this morning, more companies are not only developing deforestation commitments, but are also sharing and updating their progress publicly. Researchers who work on Forest Trends’ Supply Change initiative evaluated 447 companies that made 760 various commitments to eliminating deforestation. These companies are concentrated in the beef, soy, palm oil, and timber and paper industries, the four commodities NGOs including the Union of Concerned Scientists describe as driving global deforestation. At a high level, the good news is that the amount of anti-deforestation commitments as of this year increased over the number Forest Trends tracked in 2016. A commitment, however, does not necessarily translate into action: This same survey suggests that 1 in 5 such commitments has become dormant, and at least a third of the companies surveyed have allowed at least one commitment to languish. Forest Trends says it sees the most progress on transparency within the palm oil and timber sectors. Certification programs such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certainly help. The report also states that “collective action spurs individual action,” as when a company makes a pledge to support commitments including the New York Declaration on Forests or the High Carbon Stock Approach Group. But researchers also found that companies with ties to global cattle and soy supply chains are lagging behind on deforestation commitments. The links between soy and cattle are a concern for Forest Trends, as many NGOs insist the global beef industry alone is responsible for twice as much deforestation as palm oil, timber and soy combined. Mounting evidence suggests that many global companies are behind a resurgence in deforestation across South America, especially in Brazil and Bolivia. Hence organizations such as the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef and the Leather Working Group have a lot of work ahead – but will also find plenty of opportunities to guide and assist these industries to be more accountable and sustainable. “Media and public scrutiny around palm oil and its links to tropical forest destruction has helped drive companies to act in order to satisfy growing demands from shareholders and consumers for sustainable practices and products,” Stephen Donofrio, senior advisor for Forest Trends’ Supply Change initiative, told TriplePundit in an emailed statement. “What our research shows us about major consumer-facing brands from the U.S. and Europe is a great start, but we won’t see transformational change until all companies in the palm value chain – particularly those in Asia – get on board. Governments have a critical supporting role to play by adopting and enforcing better policies.” This report should be a wake-up call for retailers to hold their entire supply chains more responsible to halt deforestation as their products make their way from farms to these companies’ store shelves. Of all the companies analyzed, at least 70 percent of processors, producers and traders have issued deforestation commitments, as well as two-thirds of manufacturers. The retail sector is far behind, however, as Forest Trends estimates that just over half of these companies have developed clear and transparent deforestation policies. The researchers were careful not to single out individual companies, but they did tip their hats to Walmart for making progress on its zero-deforestation commitment. But similar studies reveal that many retail companies are silent on the issue – a disappointment considering that their buying power can help push their suppliers to clean up their operations. Overall, Forest Trends’ researchers are hopeful, considering that a year ago, only a little over a third of corporate deforestation policies could be verified. That ratio has surged to over 50 percent this year. And as more companies join industry organizations and follow sustainability guidelines, that pressure will help persuade other companies to follow their lead – especially when it comes to privately-held firms, which tend to be more opaque as they do not have to follow the same disclosure policies as their publicly-held peers.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 March 2017 by Military News Bringing Augmented Reality to Warehouses Business and Economic Development Science and Technology Bringing Augmented Reality to Warehouses March 14, 2017 • Atlanta, GA Click image to enlarge Sarthak Srinivas visited a warehouse a few months ago and worked a shift as a picker. It was his job to get a bunch of items scattered throughout the warehouse and bring them to one location. After a few hours of manipulating a heavy cart and carrying a tablet and a barcode scanning gun, his back and legs began to hurt. He also had trouble finding his way around the large, unfamiliar warehouse. Shortly after his warehouse visit, Srinivas, a computer science major at Georgia Tech, entered a hackathon with two other computer science majors. The three do research in augmented reality and wondered how the technology could be used in an everyday setting. They applied their research to the inefficiencies at warehouses and created PickAR, a headset that uses augmented reality technology to overlay picking information so warehouses can find and process orders more efficiently. The invention is one of six competing for the 2017 Georgia Tech InVenture Prize. The annual competition awards $35,000 in cash prizes and brings together student innovators from all academic backgrounds to foster creativity, invention and entrepreneurship. “Warehouses have three main problems and PickAR can solve them all really well,” explained Srinivas, who is from Bangalore, India. The device integrates with existing warehouse management systems so the pickers always have the most relevant information available. The team also built the barcode scanner into the headset, eliminating the need to carry additional equipment. And they included a navigation system that takes advantage of the headset’s tracking capabilities to map out where to go in the warehouse. The device calculates which package is closest and where it is located and provides this information in the top left corner of the headset. Then the headset maps out the shortest path, using green arrows to lead the way. Order picking constitutes up to 60 percent of the operational costs for warehouses, said Cheng Hann Gan, who is from Wheaton, Ill. And since about 80 percent of order picking in warehouses is manual any improvement will allow companies to save money, he added.   The team envisions the technology being used in warehouses run by large companies such as Amazon and Wal-Mart. But they said it could also benefit large government archives and libraries as well. “As computer science majors we knew we could create these solutions and design it in a way for everyone to use,” said Wenqi Xian, who is from Beijing.  CategoriesUncategorized TagsBusiness, Companies, Computing, gun, major, Science, Technology, Uncategorized Post navigation Previous PostPrevious X-raypad Begins Offering Custom and Gaming Mouse Pads at Wholesale Prices Next PostNext An Easier Way to Apply for Internships Search Recent Posts Judge Announces Intention To Confirm Peabody Energy Plan Of Reorganization, Paving Way For Emergence AJC Statement on President Trump’s 2018 Budget Proposal The 8th China (Guangrao) International Rubber Tire & Auto Accessory Exhibition is set to take place Reed Exhibitions Greater China Views 2017 With A Positive Outlook American Hotel Income Properties REIT LP Announces Sale of Hotel Property and March 2017 U.S. Dollar Cash Distribution Proudly powered by WordPress

In 15 minutes, they can slap the thrill of victory on a T, as licensed merchandise moves at the speed of sports. by Eben Novy-Williams @novy_williams More stories by Eben Novy-Williams March 15, 2017, 7:00 AM EDT From Subscribe Reprints At 6:03 p.m. on Sunday, March 12, Northwestern University’s men’s basketball team officially earned its first NCAA Tournament berth in the school’s history. At 6:07, Fanatics Inc., the world’s largest sports apparel retailer, posted its newest product, a purple Northwestern T-shirt that reads “Chicago Is Dancin’: The Road to the Final Four.” Photographer: Caroline Tompkins for Bloomberg Businessweek That’s the speed at which licensed sports merchandise moves now: minutes and seconds, not hours and days. If you’ve gone online to buy a shirt, hat, or jersey for your favorite team, you’ve likely bought it from Fanatics—whether you knew it or not. In the past five years, Fanatics has crept into every facet of the sports apparel industry. “This is the biggest change to a single marketplace that we’ve seen in a decade or two,” says Marty Brochstein, a senior vice president at the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers’ Association. That Northwestern shirt was an easy layup for the Fanatics team—the Wildcats were almost guaranteed a berth in this year’s tournament, and the design was approved on March 7—but what happens when Nowhere U. beats Duke University in the opening round? Those are the moments Fanatics really lives for. The company has roughly a dozen rapid responders camped in its Jacksonville, Fla., and San Mateo, Calif., offices during tournament games. “That’s my Ferrari team,” says Raphael Peck, president of Fanatics’ branded apparel division. “They only go fast.” The war rooms look like man caves that have just hosted all-night hackathons: laptops litter tables, while pinboards lining the walls are full of layouts, notes, and templates. At one end of each room are a few flatscreen TVs, which on a normal day are used mostly for videoconferencing. During a major sports event, however, each will be tuned to a game and monitored intently. When the clock expires, it’s go time. As an official NCAA partner, Fanatics has design books for each college that list approved logos, colors, and typefaces. Using those raw ingredients, it takes the rapid responders all of a few minutes to whip up a T-shirt reflecting the storyline, whether it’s a come-from-behind victory by an acclaimed powerhouse or a moment in the sun for an also-ran. From there, the design goes to the school’s licensing or athletic department for approval. Once that’s received—which can be almost immediately, if Fanatics has a long-standing relationship with the program, or take agonizing minutes with a school caught unawares—the shirt is listed on the Fanatics website. The whole process can take less than 15 minutes from final shot to first sale. Photo illustration: 731; Photograph: Getty Images Peck is the architect of this part of Fanatics’ business; prior to his arrival, the company was almost entirely a retail outlet for other manufacturers’ merchandise. The shift occurred under the leadership of billionaire Michael Rubin, who bought Fanatics in 2011 and merged it with his e-commerce technology company, GSI Inc., which, among other things, handled online sales for the major U.S. sports leagues. Rubin sold GSI to EBay Inc. later that year but hung onto his league relationships, which he transferred to Fanatics, and then used proceeds from the sale to acquire Plantation, Fla.-based sports retailer Dreams Inc. The combined enterprise quickly grew into a merchandise juggernaut, with products ranging from apparel and jerseys to branded bobbleheads, lawn chairs, mugs, and grills. Fanatics won’t discuss financials, but it was valued at $3.1 billion when it raised capital in 2015. Peck joined Fanatics in 2013 from Oakley Inc., where he’d been in charge of its global apparel and footwear business. Spend a few minutes talking to him, and it’s clear he loves speed: “Ferrari team” is a term of endearment; he sometimes calls them the Lamborghini team or the Porsche team, depending on how he’s feeling. To fully show off its flexibility and speed, Fanatics needs narratives, and the three-week, 68-team NCAA basketball tournament is the autobahn of sporting events. It occurs at an otherwise slow time on the sports calendar, between the end of the NFL season and the beginning of the NBA playoffs, and it’s invariably full of unpredictable (i.e., highly marketable) moments. The “Ferrari team” printing T-shirts during the 2016 tourney. Photo illustration: 731; Photographs: Getty Images; Courtesy Fanatics Just ask the folks at Georgia State University. In 2015 the No. 14-seed Panthers pulled off a memorable upset, posting a 57-56 win over No. 3-seed Baylor University in the first round. The game-winning three-pointer was made by the coach’s son. Dad, who had torn his Achilles tendon celebrating their tournament berth, fell off his seat in shock as the shot sunk into the net. The win stunned Georgia State’s athletic department almost as much as it did the rest of the country. Until that moment, merchandise was an afterthought and, in retrospect, a missed opportunity. Brian Kelly, who oversees the Panthers’ external affairs, calls it “the Baylor whiff.” “Don’t get me wrong, we made a lot of money, and it had an impact, but we could have had something much better if we were more prepared,” Kelly says. “It was an important lesson.” Fanatics helped compensate for some of that unpreparedness. Within 15 minutes, a shirt with the David-vs.-Goliath-esque slogan “This Was No Upset,” spelled out in Georgia State’s approved fonts and colors, had been approved and posted for sale on the Fanatics website. Psychologically, that 15 minutes is critical. In today’s on-demand society, fleeting attention spans require instantaneous satisfaction. A student’s, parent’s, or alum’s passion peaks right at the end of a big game. “To fully monetize that opportunity, you want to be up and running as close as possible to that highest level of passion,” Peck says. “Speed is absolutely critical. As quick as that passion grows is as quick as it dissipates.” Fanatics’ licensing deals differ by school, but in general, colleges get 10 percent to 18 percent of the $20 to $30 retail price. Photo illustration: 731; Photographs: Timothy A. Clary/Getty Images; Getty Images Not that long ago, the supply chain for sports gear took days. For events such as the Super Bowl, a lot of material had to be printed in advance, creating upfront risk for manufacturers and a lot of wasted product. Items surrounding less-predictable events were much harder to manage: Set the whole design, approval, print, package, and shipping process in motion, and the moment had likely passed by the time the product was available. That was most true in the NCAA Tournament, where a team can go from Cinderella to eliminated in 48 hours. (Again, see Georgia State, which lost in the second round to sixth-seeded Xavier University, 75-67.) Fanatics’ U.S.-based manufacturing process is nimble enough to keep up. If only 10 people want a shirt to commemorate that crazy upset, Fanatics will sell, and print, only 10. Lately, the company has begun to expand and diversify its operations. It runs the online shops for MLB, Nascar, the NBA, NFL, and NHL, as well as for dozens of individual franchises and university athletic departments. Fanatics also runs the NBA’s flagship store in New York and has a rapidly growing memorabilia offshoot, signing stars including Stephen Curry, Ronda Rousey, and Peyton Manning for exclusive rights to their autographs and collectibles. Most important, under Peck’s guidance, Fanatics has begun taking on the exclusive rights to manufacture licensed gear, which allows the company to put its own brand on its goods (instead of, say, Nike’s), and hence in the public eye. When the New England Patriots won the Super Bowl this year, quarterback Tom Brady and his teammates celebrated in the locker room with Fanatics-branded shirts. Starting next season, the company will make all the replica jerseys for the NHL, plus on-ice Stanley Cup merchandise. Of course, Fanatics is far from the only one in this space. Major sporting goods companies such as Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour remain major licensees, and retailers such as Wal-Mart, Target, and Dick’s Sporting Goods sell a lot of sports apparel. But no company is combining those two functions like Fanatics, let alone matching its speed. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up To stay ahead, Fanatics is doubling down on manufacturing. It’s investing more than $100 million in technology and production, including a new platform for all its sites; apparel personalization capabilities; and communication between its main warehouses in Jacksonville and Frazeysburg, Ohio, and the one being built in Las Vegas. Also new this year is a special printing process, somewhere between slower, one-off digital printing and faster bulk screen printing. The middle ground will allow the company to meet production requirements for items with more than niche but less than wide interest. (Fanatics uses its own algorithms to determine likely demand.) It tested the system during the Super Bowl and World Series and will implement it fully during the NCAA Tournament. There’s at least one area where Fanatics is deliberately slowing itself down. For major championships such as the Super Bowl, when there are two possible winners and lots of possible designs for each team that can be prepared ahead of time, the company doesn’t list all its products at once; it rolls them out in waves. The aim is to give fans a reason to check back and buy something new. Less than a minute after explaining that, though, Peck gets back on message. “We want to be at internet speed,” he says. “You can never be too fast.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Some wanted to know when the spring flowering annuals would be in stock. That's life in New England when there is a March snowstorm and life at a store that sells products and equipment for homes and gardens in the springtime like Kelly's Home & Garden in Westfield. Owners Brian and Stacey Kelly reopened both Kelly's Home & Garden in Westfield and Palmer Agway, both on Route 20, in February, just in time for the spring rush. The stores, along with a third location in Athol, closed at the end of 2016. Stacey's father and Brain's father-in-law, Francis E. Hartnett of Enfield, Connecticut, was the owner of the Agways in Westfield, Palmer and Athol. In February, his creditors ordered auctions at the three locations to settle the company's debts. Monday, Brian didn't want to talk about the details of the transition except to say that he and Stacey were both longtime employees at the stores and they were able to rehire 10 other former employees to staff the Westfield and Palmer locations. Brian Kelly bought many of the store's fixtures including shelves and display cases at auction. Most of the inventory was sold off piecemeal. They are not reopening Athol, the only location where Hartnett owned the real estate at the end. According to records on file at the Hampden County Registry of Deeds, Hartnett sold the Westfield location to businessman Nabil Hannoush in February 2016 for $1.4 million. Hannoush leased the store to the Kelly family and worked with them to get the Westfield store reopened, despite he said other offers from national retailers interested in obtaining the site. Hannoush has plans and state approval install a traffic light at his family's nearby business, which includes the Shortstop Bar & Grill, to make it easier for customers to come and go from the whole complex, including Agway. While he's happy there will be a light, Brian Kelly's first job is letting people know the stores are back. "If we had to be closed, we picked the perfect time," Brian Kelly said. "The winter, up until now, didn't have too much snow so people wouldn't have been coming in for salt and snowblower parts. And it was too soon for spring." He said many loyal customers only come in during warm weather. "I've had people tell me this week that they didn't know we were closed," he said. "That's good and bad because it means they aren't used to coming in in winter." For now, the Kellys and their employees are busy restocking shelves and setting up new displays. Husqvarna power equipment and parts are on order. So are the garden plants for the greenhouse. "Fruit trees might come this week," Brian Kelly said. "They might have to wait in the warehouse." Agway, now owned by Southern States Cooperative in Richmond, Virginia, has a distribution center across Westfield on Lockhouse Road. That makes it easy, Brian Kelly said, to get more stock in and adjust quickly to changes in weather and demand. He can get what he needs quickly. That's part of how he plans to compete with the big box stores that dominate so much of retail on the Route 20 strip. In Westfield, he's got a Walmart on one side and The Home Depot on the other. "It is always going to be about service," Brain Kelly said. "If you're lawn is dead. We can help. If you are a regular customer, we know your lawn and we know what it needs." Stacey Kelly said the stores will stock products from local crafters, like a collection of witty signs on display from Rustic Creations in Southampton. "They made a few signs for us, and I started thinking 'Hey, i can sell this'," Stacey Kelly said. "A lot of these local people are looking for a place to sell their products. Why not here?"

None cover a more pressing issue than Vern Gowdie’s The End of Australia. It’s a strictly limited print run. So if you want to put your name to a copy and have it mailed to you, you need to let us know RIGHT NOW. You can do so here. Why is this book more vital than any we have ever published? Because in it, Vern deep-dives into the central issue facing Australian investors: What will happen — particularly in Australia — when the next big global financial hits? No other work that we know of has carried out such a detailed investigation. The facts Vern uncovers in The End of Australia are pretty shocking. But the ‘plan for the worst/hope for the best’ wealth strategy he outlines is compelling. Every investor should be taking these five precautions now, says Vern. Why? Because, when the next global share market rout occurs, we will not have a mining boom to protect us. And we’ll get an idea, very quickly, of just how fragile our economy has been for some time now… What will that share market rout look like? And how close might we be to it? Read Vern’s sobering essay below for more…] *** Why Australians Are Sleepwalking into a Nightmare ‘No one sees what we are seeing.’ ‘Are we blinded by our bias, or are they oblivious to what’s going on?’ So went a recent conversation with a good friend about the rise and rise of the US share market. Are we missing something, or is it a case of being patient for the switch to be flicked from boom to bust? To help rationalise this disconnect between what we think is a fait accompli and what the herd is doing, we draw inspiration from acclaimed psychologists Kahneman & Tversky. In their book On the Psychology of Prediction,they wrote: ‘For if we can explain tomorrow what we cannot predict today, without any added information except the knowledge of the actual outcome, then this outcome must have been determined in advance and we should have been able to predict it. ‘The fact that we couldn’t, is taken as an indication of our limited intelligence rather than of the uncertainty that is in the world.’ Based on the data we have, the outcome of this financially-irresponsible experiment by a handful of central banker PhDs has been determined in advance. Record debt levels; downward wage pressures; historically high price-to-earnings ratios; unfunded and unaffordable welfare promises; the sheer volume of boomer retirees; ultra-low interest rates; QE used to inflate asset prices; excessive corporate debt funding for buybacks — and not for capital investment; too much supply and not enough demand. The outcome is that the system will collapse. As I show in my new book, The End of Australia, the lack of recognition of this actual outcome is an indication of limited intelligence…more specifically, the fact that very few people possess financial intelligence. When markets are running hot, how many people ask the question, ‘Why is this so?’ The majority simply accept that this is the way it is. Questions are rarely asked in boom times. No one wants to jinx the market. The failure to recognise previous patterns of human nature is the reason history is doomed to repeat itself. Those famous four words…this time is different ‘It’s like most trends — at the beginning it’s driven by fundamentals; in the end, by speculation. It’s just like the old adage: “What the wise man does in the beginning, the fool does in the end.”’ Warren Buffett Actually, when people say ‘this time is different’, it proves it’s not different…because that’s what they always say to rationalise away the irrational behaviour of the mob. The speculative end of the trend is evident in an article titled ‘BAML Survey of Asset Managers Says “Boom” Best Describes Market’, published by Value Walk. Here’s an extract: ‘Major asset managers have been deploying cash. The BAML [Bank of America Merrill Lynch] Fund Manager Survey (FMS), released February 14 [2017], is a monthly survey of 200-250 primarily long-only investors.  The report showed that major asset managers have been deploying their dry powder, as cash holdings dipped to 4.9% from 5.1%. ‘The stock market is a buy, the BAML report noted, as cutting in cash holdings is supported by strong investor sentiment.’ The ‘boom’ is supported by‘strong investor sentiment’. The following chart depicts the four stages of a bubble: Stealth: Smart money buys in; Awareness: The institutional money buys into the trend; Mania: The public want a piece of the ‘easy money’ action; and Blow-off: Watch out below.   Greed and delusion — which manifest in ‘this time is different’ assertions — is where I think we are at today. Source: Hofstra University, New York [Click to enlarge] The predictability of human nature is what makes the phases of a bubble so easy to plot. This is from the article that accompanied the above graph (emphasis mine): ‘Bubbles can be very damaging, especially for those who arrived late with the hope of getting something for nothing. Even if they are inflationary events, the outcome of a bubble’s blow off is very deflationary as large quantities of capital vanish in the wave of bankruptcies and financial defaults they trigger. Historically, they tended to be far in-between, but between 1995 and 2008 three bubbles took place back-to-back; the stock market (deflated in 2000), real estate (deflated in 2006) and commodities (deflated in 2008).’ Tearing up large chunks of capital is deflationary for one simple reason…people have less to spend. Which is why the Fed and other central banks had to flood the markets with liquidity after 2008/09. They were trying to create Ben Bernanke’s theoretical ‘wealth effect’. Given that the world is already wrestling with deflationary forces — cheap labour, excess productive capacity and the increasing uptake of automation — the next market crash could take us into a depression. The article notes that, historically, bubbles tended to be few and far between. Their tempo increased after 1995. Greenspan, Bernanke and Yellen have proven to be serial bubble-blowers. When confronted with the natural ebb and flow forces of a market, the Fed’s programmed response is to ‘prime the pumps’. Giving rise to the next (bigger and more damaging) bubble. Source: Quantitas Capital [Click to enlarge] The reality is that asset prices cannot permanently outgrow underlying economic activity. Facilitating easy access to an abundance of cheap money can, and does, cause a deviation from the economy. However, the deviation is temporary, not permanent. The orange line (US GDP) eventually exerts a gravitational pull on asset prices (blue line). When the bubble cycle makes a full rotation, those who hoped to get something for nothing will find out the hard way that this time is not different.

And it focuses on some steps you can take right now to protect yourself. (If you’d like a hardcopy while we’re still mailing them, you’ll need to be quick. I’m told just 10,000 copies have been printed. You can reserve one here.) But why, in a book about Australia, do I spend quite a bit of time looking at the US markets and economy? My approach to investing is more macro than micro. I am a lousy stock picker — as are a lot of professional fund managers. But at least I admit it. If we can get the big trends reasonably right, then we can participate in the wave up and avoid the inevitable crash. You’ll never pick the bottom or the top. The aim is to invest somewhere in the ‘stealth’ phase and exit in the ‘mania’ phase. It’s a given that you’ll enter a little late and leave too early, but no one ever went broke taking a profit. Successful investing is about making a considered risk-versus-reward assessment. When markets are in the ‘stealth’ phase, they represent a low risk/high reward proposition. In the ‘mania’ phase there is a distinct and fundamentally important reversal in market characteristics — high risk/low reward. As the ‘mania’ phase continues, the market dynamics become extremely high risk/negative reward. Yet the majority read the signs differently. In their mind the market is signalling ‘no risk/really high reward’ in the mania phase and ‘high risk/no return’ in the stealth phase. Identifying trends and making judgement calls is how I manage my money. The following graphic on who’s who in the global economic zoo shows you why we have to take notice of the 600-pound gorilla on the other side of the Pacific Ocean. If you look closely, on the bottom right (around four o’clock on the chart), you’ll see Australia…at 1.8% of the global economy. In the scheme of things, we do not matter. Source: Visual Capitalist [Click to enlarge] If something goes awry in the US, China or one of the big four in Europe, we’re caught in the downdraft. Given the interconnectivity resulting from globalisation, it’s not hard to see why dominoes falling in one part of the world will eventually reach our shores. The Western world and China dominate the global economy. Each one of these major players is grappling with the same problems, to varying degrees: massive debt overhang; demographic issues (less births, more retirees); low wages growth; youth unemployment, and rising levels of lower and middle class unrest. The global economy is more fragile than most people think. All it takes is for one significant piece of this economic puzzle to experience a contraction, and we have a world of trouble. Watching what’s happening beyond our shores is like an over-the-horizon radar…hoping to spot a problem in advance and take the necessary precautions to protect our capital. When the US share market falls 50%, 60% or 70%, the All Ords will play follow the leader. Why deflation is so persistent The US economy is 70% consumption. With average US household income stuck in a time warp — not buying any more than it did in the 1970s — the fight for the US consumer dollar is intense. The rise of Amazon, at the expense of traditional retailers, is evident in the following graphic. The US consumer (as well as the Aussie, UK and European consumer) is looking to make their dollar/pound/euro stretch further by turning to online suppliers. The destruction in shareholder value of the major retailers over the past decade is breathtaking. Sears is down 96%. JC Penney is down 86%. A decade ago these were not penny dreadful stocks. They were retailing institutions. Even the giant Walmart has only managed to stay static. Source: Visual Capitalist [Click to enlarge] Amazon is coming to Australia, and the same level of creative destruction is likely to hit our major retailers. There will be a knock-on effect to yields from real estate investment trusts (REITs) with large exposures to shopping centres. The deflationary trend of online consumption is only going to embed itself into the system, as the negative loop of retail closures, staff lay-offs, the reduction in penalty rates and lower yields on REITs force more and more people to seek more ‘bang for their buck’. Mix in the deflationary effect of an asset bubble bursting, and we have the very real potential to experience a Greater Depression. To quote another famous Buffett truism, ‘Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.’ I fear that most people are completely unaware of the unsustainable pressures building within the global economy. Thanks to history, we know the outcome — the ‘wealth effect’ asset bubble will burst. The economic fallout will be far worse than 2008/09, and social unrest will escalate. Now is a time to be fearful. Remain cautious — and, unlike the US investment institutions, keep your powder dry.
