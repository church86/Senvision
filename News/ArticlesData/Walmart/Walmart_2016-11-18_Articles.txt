Black Friday deals have a tendency to repeat themselves, so three or four major retailers may offer nearly identical deals on video game bundles or flat-screen televisions. Figuring out which store really has the best deals can take a lot of work, but below you can find a list of the top deals on video games and electronics along with the best offerings from some of the major Black Friday destinations. With all deals once exclusive to Black Friday now spreading out across the month of November and also beyond Thanksgiving, there is some worry among consumers that the best deals may not actually be on Black Friday. NerdWallet’s 2016 Consumer Holiday Shopping Report found that’s a concern of two in three shoppers. But as Fortune noted, those fears can be put to rest — the best sales this holiday shopping season will indeed be on Black Friday 2016. “NerdWallet’s analysis of ads from retailers, however, shows there’s no reason to fear that you’ll miss out,” the report noted. “Major stores, such as Kohl’s, JCPenney, Best Buy, Kmart and Sears, truly are offering better prices on Black Friday than on other November sales.” Best Black Friday 2016 video game deals Shoppes looking for deals on video games and systems like the Xbox One or Playstation 4 Slim or 4 Pro will have a lot of deals to sift through.Virtually every retailer is offering bundles with systems and video games together, and many of those deals look nearly identical. Shoppers looking for Playstation deals can look through a complete list from CNet. The highlights include a PS4 Slim Uncharted Bundle for $250 at Walmart along with a $30 gift card. For those not into console gaming, PC Gamer is putting together a list of the best PC gaming deals on Black Friday.

Consumer Reports has compiled a list of the best deals on televisions, which includes: 43-inch Element ELEFW408 4K UHD TV, $125, at Target 49-inch Toshiba 4K smart TV, $200, at Best Buy 60-inch Vizio 1080p smart TV, $300, at Walmart Tablets and cell phones are also a popular pick, and Network World has a list of the best deals on Android devices and Fortune has a list of the best ones from Apple — which includes a $250 gift card from Walmart with the purchase of any iPhone and a $125 discount on iPad Air 2 and iPad Pro models at Best Buy.

Net income at the Arkansas-based king of retailers fell 8.2 percent to $3 billion for its latest quarter, compared with the same period last year. A big reason: It rolled out pay increases across its legions of workers to better the experience at its cavernous stores. Wal-Mart is also investing big in technology as it digests its acquisition of Jet.com, an e-commerce player that sought to challenge Amazon. Jet’s founder, Marc Lore, is now part of Wal-Mart’s leadership team. At the same time, revenues, which have been stagnating for many large brick-and-mortar retailers, rose 0.7 percent, a result greatly helped by rising e-commerce sales. (Factoring out foreign-exchange gyrations resulting from a stronger U.S. dollar, revenue rose 2.5 percent.)

On Thursday, Wal-Mart shares closed down 3.1 percent at $69.19. The company is valued at about $217 billion, or about 58 percent of Amazon’s worth. Maybe, as Saunders puts it, “Wal-Mart will need to show that its investments are delivering returns, especially on the e-commerce front.” — Ángel González: agonzalez@seattletimes.com Blue Nile ‘webroom’ opening in Bellevue Online jeweler Blue Nile is expanding its brick-and-mortar footprint as the company prepares to open one of its small-format showrooms in Bellevue Square next week. The Seattle-based company hasn’t set an exact date but says it will open sometime Thanksgiving week on the first floor in the south wing of Bellevue Square. It’s the company’s fifth so-called “webroom”; the company opened the first in June 2015 at Roosevelt Field mall in Garden City, N.Y. The webrooms are much smaller than traditional mall jewelry stores. And while customers can see and try on some of the company’s products in the stores, all purchases will be done online through tablets in the stores. Its salespeople are noncommissioned. The company expects to add five more stores next year and plans to eventually have dozens. Blue Nile first tested display cases of its jewelry at a few Nord­strom stores a couple of years ago; those displays have since closed. The bright-and-white webrooms include a panoramic TV wall where videos and live feeds of postings from the company’s social-media fans are featured. CEO Harvey Kanter said the rent and staff costs of the showroom are less than running advertising through Google to draw in customers. Blue Nile is among the formerly online-only pure plays, including Amazon and Warby Parker, that are expanding their brick-and-mortar presence. “Most people want to touch, feel and look before they make a purchase. They do like the tactile experience,” said Brendan Witcher, an analyst at Forrester Research. More and more shoppers are researching online first, then buying at a store. This year, about $376 billion of the $3.4 trillion in overall retail sales will be done online. — Janet I. Tu: jtu@seattletimes.com Allen’s painting sold for $26 million Billionaire Paul Allen’s painting of a war jet by Gerhard Richter fetched $25.6 million at Phillips on Wednesday in New York. Bloomberg News reports. The 1963 canvas, “Dusenjager,” was estimated at $25 million to $35 million, the highest target of 18 works by the 84-year-old German artist on the auction block this past week. Phillips found an irrevocable bidder who agreed in advance to pay an undisclosed minimum price, ensuring the piece sold. Allen, a co-founder with Bill Gates of Microsoft, acquired the painting for $11.2 million in 2007, setting an auction record for the artist at the time. — Bloomberg News Seattle Times staff Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

Ah, Black Friday. Many people seem to anticipate it far more than Thanksgiving, and each year retail stores seem to start their sales earlier – for many stores, people can start shopping on Thanksgiving Day. Push the turkey aside, it’s time to hit Walmart! Or is it? “Black Friday” has come to be a double-edged sword in many peoples’ minds – for those who work retail, it is likely met with dread, as it cuts into their Thanksgiving time with family and subjects them to hordes of people, some of which have become unruly and occasionally violent. In fact, store employees and shoppers have been killed on Black Friday, usually from being trampled to death, such as the Walmart worker who died when eager and frenzied shoppers knocked doors down and stampeded a Walmart on an early Black Friday morning. The most recent death is that of a Walmart employee in Long Island, New York, according to the New York Daily News. People may shake their heads at how people could so carelessly regard a human life because of a “good deal” on appliances or electronics, but the psychology behind the instances of stampedes on Black Friday is nothing new in the realm of human behavior, experts agree. Kenneth Manning, a professor of marketing at Colorado State University, in an interview with LiveScience, says there is a reason that people seem to lose their collective minds in hopes of a “good deal.” “When they can look in the environment and find different cues that make them think they’re getting a good deal, the decision-making can be somewhat emotional.” In fact, studies have found that deal-finding frenzies, real or perceived, cause a release of oxytocin, a chemical of bonding that causes loving and positive feelings – so it’s no wonder what when combined with the cultural norm that has become “Black Friday,” people are not collectively being their most rational selves. Even with that phenomenon, violence is fairly rare, though incivility in stores may not be. Even if you are the type that can overlook bad behavior, it’s time to “talk turkey:” your “Black Friday” savings are not that great, and they may even be a scam or more expensive than you’d normally pay, according to how retail stores promote and sell items. [Image by Ken Cavanaugh/Getty Images] According to Business Insider, there are solid economic reasons about why people should avoid “Black Friday” shopping. Those flyers that promise “door-buster” savings probably are just that – they may cause people to bust down a door (which, as referenced earlier in this article, has killed people) – but the majority off the time, they are not the lowest prices of the season, which typically peaks about nine days before Christmas. And, to make it even more unbearable that you’re waking up at four a.m. (or leaving family behind at Thanksgiving dinner), Kyle James, founder of Rather-be-shopping.com, says that most of the “deals” are on off-brand goods. The relevance of this fact is dependent on your particular needs, James says. “The problem is the brands you’ll find on sale are typically unrecognizable. If you’re a college student and looking for a disposable TV from Best Buy for your dorm room you’ll want to head out Black Friday morning. If you’re looking for a quality TV that will hold up for the long run, you’ll want to look for deals right after Christmas through Super Bowl Sunday.” [Image by Kena Betancur/Getty Images] James also said that the best deals are occurring the three days before Thanksgiving, not after. “The early bird does indeed get the worm. By ‘early bird,’ I’m not talking about being the first one through the doors on Thanksgiving or Black Friday. I’m talking about shopping on the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday before Black Friday and scoring a deal.” However, if you’re a person who enjoys that side of an oxytocin rush along with your turkey entrée, go bravely forward with the crowd. Keep in mind, though, according to Black Friday Death Count, seven people have died and 98 were injured in Black Friday-related accidents from 2006 to 2014. The statistics on 2015 have yet to be added. Causes of injury included stampedes, fights, and falling asleep while driving home from shopping due to lack of sleep and waiting in lines all night. How you choose to spend the Thanksgiving holiday is, of course, up to you. I’ll be spending it in my house with a hot cup of coffee.

Matthew Frankel (TMFMathGuy) Nov 19, 2016 at 8:23AM Image source: The Motley Fool. In a recently released SEC filing, it was revealed that Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) had opened new stakes in all four major U.S. airlines, which came as a big surprise to many of the company's shareholders, myself included. In addition, Buffett and company got rid of more than two-thirds of a stake it has held for some time. Here are the details of these two moves and why the company might have made them. A surprising bet on airlines Berkshire's SEC filings revealed stakes in American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), and United Continental Holdings (NYSE:UAL). Separately, Buffett revealed that Berkshire had also purchased shares of Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) after the third quarter ended. This was a surprise to Berkshire shareholders, particularly because Buffett has been negative on airlines throughout much of his investing career, ever since a 1989 investment in US Airways preferred stock went sour. For the next several years, he referred to the investment as a mistake, and in 2007 he said, "The worst sort of business is one that grows rapidly, requires significant capital to engender the growth, then earns little or no money. Think airlines." Per his usual policy, Buffett didn't say why he made the airline investments, but there are a few things Berkshire followers should know. For starters, as my colleague Adam Levine-Weinberg pointed out in a separate article, airline stocks plunged in late June in the wake of the Brexit vote, just before the start of the third quarter. In fact, a couple of the airlines have rallied by more than 50% since then. So, it's possible that Buffett or his stock pickers simply saw deeply undervalued stocks and wanted to take advantage. DAL data by YCharts. In addition, the airline business has changed significantly since Buffett last dipped his toes in the water. Airlines have done a good job of keeping expenses in check in recent years, and have produced strong margins. All are generating strong cash flow, and have been aggressive about returning capital to shareholders. A not-so-surprising sale In a less-surprising move, Berkshire reported that it got rid of about 70% of its stake in Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT), a large amount of stock that is valued at about $2.1 billion as I write this. I say that this isn't much of a surprise for a couple of reasons. First, Berkshire has been disposing of its Wal-Mart stake in recent quarters. The previous sales have been much smaller, but it has become clear that Berkshire has a somewhat bearish view of Wal-Mart right now. While we don't know for sure exactly why Berkshire is getting rid of Wal-Mart, I can say with confidence that it is becoming less of a "Buffett stock." Specifically, it has been gradually losing the competitive advantage it enjoyed in the pre-internet economy. In its prime, Wal-Mart was able to undercut virtually every other retailer, thanks to its scale, no-frills store design, and efficient distribution network. These days, this simply isn't the case. Internet retailers, particularly Amazon.com, can operate just as efficiently as Wal-Mart, and as a result, Wal-Mart's market share has begun to erode. To be perfectly clear, Wal-Mart will be just fine as a business, but an eroding market share and competitive advantage are the exact opposite of what Warren Buffett likes to see in his stock investments. Should you follow Buffett? Not necessarily. I wouldn't go so far as to call the airlines a bad investment right now, but it's safe to say that they're significantly more expensive than the price Buffett paid for them. And Wal-Mart still has a bright future ahead of it, in my opinion, so I'd be reluctant to sell if I were already a shareholder. It can be a great idea to follow the moves of billionaire investors -- not necessarily to make the same moves, but for the investing lessons that can be learned. For example, in Wal-Mart's case, the lesson is "when the reasons you originally bought a stock no longer apply, it's time to reevaluate your investment." There are valuable lessons you can learn from all of Buffett's investment activity, so it's important to read between the lines when he (or another billionaire) buys or sells a stock.

Welspun India, a giant home textile manufacturer, is in trouble for falsely advertising bedding products as containing Egyptian cotton.

But in the last four months, it’s been at the center of a controversy that has caused many Americans to wonder whether the Egyptian cotton sheets they rely on for a good night’s sleep actually contain any cotton from Egypt. Why aren't more big brands designing clothes for people with disabilities? Read more The controversy involves Welspun India, a giant home textile manufacturer. Target, Walmart and a handful of other big US retailers have pulled hundreds of thousands of bedding sheets off shelves after discovering that Welspun had sold them falsely labeled Egyptian cotton products. Welspun has seen its stock price tumble since Target led the defection in August when an investigation by the retailer found the 750,000 sheets and pillow cases that Welspun labeled as 100% Egyptian cotton were actually fake. Bed, Bath & Beyond, also one of Welspun’s top customers, is the latest to stop selling the manufacturer’s 100% Egyptian cotton sheets, Bloomberg reported. Welspun, which sells its goods in more than 50 countries and generated $871.4m in annual revenue, is now facing consumer lawsuits over the fake sheets. Most recently, a suit was filed against Walmart, alleging that the store knew about the problem for years but didn’t pull the sheets until two months ago. The trouble Welspun is in demonstrates both the difficulties of monitoring a supply chain that stretches around the world and the power of a label to entice consumers to pay more for products they perceive to be superior. The Egyptian cotton label doesn’t present a verified claim of quality – all it signifies is that the cotton is grown in Egypt. The connection to luxury comes from the recognition that the cotton makes for strong, soft and tightly woven fabric. There are around 10 varieties of cotton farmed in Egypt, according to the US Department of Agriculture. The trouble of verifying a product’s origin and quality pops up in many products, not just bedding. It’s fairly common in the food business: Whole Foods and Safeway, for example, are among the major supermarkets that have gotten in trouble for selling extra virgin oil from Italy that didn’t meet either claim. Welspun is now facing a credibility check from one of the industry groups it belongs to: the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), which aims to promote the production of sustainable cotton. Part of the BCI’s role is to set standards to ensure the cotton its members use is in fact sustainably grown and harvested. Matthew Kempen, a spokesperson for the initiative, noted that the phrase “Egyptian cotton” is more of an indicator of quality and sustainability, and that BCI doesn’t verify the origins of cotton. “As a matter of precaution we shall be contacting Welspun about the incident to request that they share their corrective actions with us, and we shall remind them that members contribute to credibility of BCI as a framework,” said Kempen. Dishonesty hurts a brand’s reputation as well as sales, said Tulin Erdem, a business and marketing professor who specializes in brand reputation management at New York University’s Stern School of Business. Welspun’s shares dropped by nearly 43% in the week following the announcement from Target, which was the manufacturer’s second largest customer and accounted for $90m, or 10% of the company’s business, in the fiscal year that ended in March. Retailers play a part in ensuring consumers get what they’re paying for. Although it can be difficult to track every manufacturer’s claim, retailers have a responsibility to take action promptly when they suspect dishonesty, said Erdem. Walmart’s actions – and whether it reacted quickly enough to protect its customers –are also under scrutiny. The lawsuit against Walmart claims that the company first became suspicious of Welspun’s Egyptian cotton label back in 2008, but only pulled the product off its shelves in September, after Target announced it was doing the same. Walmart declined to comment. Target said it was phasing out all products manufactured by Welspun under the “Fieldcrest” label after an investigation revealed sheets produced by the company between August 2014 and July 2016 used non-Egyptian cotton. This startup is using jellyfish to make eco-friendly tampons, diapers and pads Read more “Retailers with a good reputation should be vigilant about whether the claimed quality is indeed the delivered quality,” Erdem said. “The decisions about what brands to carry need to be made carefully, and that is part of quality management for a manufacturer.” Welspun did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. The company said in a statement in September to shareholders that it had hired an accounting firm to investigate its cotton suppliers. “We take the current traceability concerns around some of our product lines very seriously,” the company said. Welspun said the products under investigation represented 6% of the company’s annual business, and its deal with Walmart accounted for 1.5% of annual sales. The dwindling supply of Egyptian cotton could be a factor that leads cotton suppliers to cheat. Egyptian cotton production has been on a steady decline over the past decade as the global price for cotton has dropped and the Egyptian government has removed subsidies to help farmers. According to the US Department of Agriculture, Egypt is expected to produce 395,000 bales of cotton in 2017, down from nearly 940,000 bales in 2005. While verifying claims on labels can be challenging, technology is making it easier for retailers to at least check the reputation of certain brands, said Erdem. A laboratory outside New York City offers DNA testing to verify whether textiles are made of premium cotton. If they are, a tiny barcode is sprayed on the cotton before it is turned into yarn, allowing it to be tracked throughout the production process. “Certain claims are almost not verifiable, such as whether a certain cream delays the onset of wrinkles in the long run,” said Erdem. “But some others are easier to verify, such as the origin of the main raw material.” More features Topics Farming Retail industry Walmart Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

The sliced apples or cut broccoli — the merchant won’t say exactly what’s involved — are being used to test blockchain, a new database technology. If successful, the trial could change how Wal-Mart Stores, which serves some 260 million customers a week, monitors food and takes action when something goes wrong. That could spur big leaps in food safety, cut costs and save lives. Like most merchants, the world’s largest retailer struggles to identify and remove food that’s been recalled. When a customer becomes ill, it can take days to identify the product, shipment and vendor. With the blockchain, Wal-Mart will be able to obtain crucial data from a single receipt, including suppliers, details on how and where food was grown and who inspected it. The database extends information from the pallet to the individual package. “It gives them an ability to have an accounting from origin to completion,” said Marshal Cohen, an analyst at researcher NPD Group Inc. “If there’s an issue with an outbreak of E. coli, this gives them an ability to immediately find where it came from. That’s the difference between days and minutes.” It’s also the difference between pulling a few tainted packages and yanking all the spinach from hundreds of stores, according to Frank Yiannas, vice president of food safety at Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart. “With blockchain, you can do strategic removals, and let consumers and companies have confidence,” Yiannas said. “We believe that enhanced traceability is good for other aspects of the food systems. We hope you could capture other important attributes that would inform decisions around food flows, and even get more efficient at it.” More than 1,000 foodborne outbreaks investigated by state and local health departments are reported each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. The CDC estimates roughly 48 million people are afflicted annually, with 128,000 hospitalized and 3,000 dying. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. has suffered a year of falling sales as a result of several outbreaks. In October, Wal-Mart started tracking two products using blockchain: a packaged produce item in the U.S., and pork in China. While only two items were included, the test involved thousands of packages shipped to multiple stores. The blockchain is a distributed ledger where companies doing business with one another, such as growers, distributors and retailers, can record transactions securely. The database’s strength lies in its trustworthiness: the difficulty of reversing or changing what’s been recorded. The blockchain database can also hold much more data than what retailers get today, providing tools for more detailed analysis. That could help Wal-Mart deliver food to stores faster, reducing spoilage and waste. Cutting costs is critical for all retailers. Last year, retail sales rose only 2.1 per cent, the smallest gain since 2009, according to Retail Industry Leaders Association. Traditional offline retailers continue to be pressured by Amazon.com Inc. and its efficient supply chain. If the tests are successful, Wal-Mart will expand them to multiple food items in both countries, Yiannis said. “So far things are flowing smoothly and as expected,” he said. Wal-Mart has been at the forefront of adopting new technologies before. It began installing new chip-card readers at U.S. checkout counters 10 years before the deadline mandated by credit-card networks like Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. This summer, it took Walmart Pay nationwide, becoming one of the first large retailers to launch its own mobile-payment service. It’s also expanding its online grocery delivery service. The blockchain, a technology that only came onto the scene in 2009, is already being widely tested by companies in the financial, healthcare and natural-resource industries. Companies like International Business Machines Corp., the Nasdaq and BHP Billiton Ltd. have deployed or are planning to deploy it to run their businesses more efficiently. Wal-Mart is using blockchain technology co-developed by IBM. In October, the company opened the Walmart Food Safety Collaboration Center in Beijing. It also announced, with IBM and Tsinghua University, a collaboration using the blockchain to improve the way food is tracked, transported and sold to Chinese consumers. If Wal-Mart adopts the blockchain to track food worldwide, it could become of the largest deployments of the technology to date. “They are setting the new standards in terms of how technology can be implemented to solve a problem that’s been with us for ages,” said Paul Chang, global supply chain subject matter expert at IBM.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     NES Classic In Stock At Best Buy This Weekend: Rumor Posted: Nov 19 2016, 4:59am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 19 2016, 6:22am CST, in News | Black Friday   This story may contain affiliate links.   The Nintendo NES Classic is sold out online. The hard to find NES is rumored to be in stores this weekend. The Nintendo NES Classic is sold out online. The last chance to buy a NES Classic for the regular price of $59.99 was on Friday in the 5th flash sale of the NES Classic online at walmart.com. This promotion has now ended and Walmart has not announced a new NES sale.  Don't Miss: Top 100 Black Friday 2016 Deals Walmart was the only online store besides GameStop that offered the new mini Nintendo Entertainment System all week. GameStop offered a bundle deal the last time on Tuesday. The NES Classic launched on November 11. Nintendo had now over a week to resupply stores and the might have done just that. We already said in our latest report about the Hatchimals that retailers are shifting their limited inventories away from online shops for the Thanksgiving week. Hatchimals are more likely to be in stock at stores over the course of next week. We believe the same is true for the rare NES Classic. A rumor on a video game discussion forum supports that theory. A long time forum member at CheapAssGamer posted that a retail employee told him that Best Buy is getting a stock this weekend on Saturday and Sunday. He cautioned that he can't confirm the rumor. As the NES Classic is extremely hard to find any lead is worthwhile exploring. Visit your local Best Buy store ahead of the store opening hour to not miss out of possible stock of NES. Ask store employees about the availability of the NES.  It is also worthwhile the effort to visit the other stores that are known to carry the NES Classic. The list of stores include GameStop, Target, ToysRUs and Walmart. We'd love to hear from you in case you have information about the NES stock situation at your local store. We will send out our reporter to the malls starting Monday. The NES Classic Edition starts at $229.99 from resellers at the Amazon Market Place. On eBay the Nintendo NES Classic Edition is listed for $199 in non-auction offers.   The new Nintendo Entertainment System is a perfect product for the Holidays. It works great as gift for adults as well as kids. Families can enjoy playing the simple video games from the 80s together. There are 3rd party controllers and accessories that make the NES more fun to use. Nintendo knows it messed up, underestimating the demand for the NES Classic Edition. Nintendo has issued a statement on Twitter on November 11 acknowledging the shortage of the NES Classic Edition. "The Nintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition system is a hot item, and we are working hard to keep up with consumer demand. There will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year. Please contact your local retailers to check availability." The shrunk NES console, retailing for $59.99 list price, features the classic Nintendo NES controller many geeks have grown up with. The retro console comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES games including Super Mario Bros., Pac-Man, Metroid, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby's Adventures. The NES Classic Edition system is a miniaturized version of the groundbreaking NES, originally released in 1985.

If successful, the trial could change how Wal-Mart Stores, which serves some 260 million customers a week, monitors food and takes action when something goes wrong. That could spur big leaps in food safety, cut costs and save lives. Like most merchants, the world’s largest retailer struggles to identify and remove food that’s been recalled. When a customer becomes ill, it can take days to identify the product, shipment and vendor. With the blockchain, Wal-Mart will be able to obtain crucial data from a single receipt, including suppliers, details on how and where food was grown and who inspected it. The database extends information from the pallet to the individual package. “It gives them an ability to have an accounting from origin to completion,” said Marshal Cohen, an analyst at researcher NPD Group Inc. “If there’s an issue with an outbreak of E. coli, this gives them an ability to immediately find where it came from. That’s the difference between days and minutes.” It’s also the difference between pulling a few tainted packages and yanking all the spinach from hundreds of stores, according to Frank Yiannas, vice president of food safety at Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart. “With blockchain, you can do strategic removals, and let consumers and companies have confidence,” Yiannas said. “We believe that enhanced traceability is good for other aspects of the food systems. We hope you could capture other important attributes that would inform decisions around food flows, and even get more efficient at it.” More than 1,000 foodborne outbreaks investigated by state and local health departments are reported each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC estimates roughly 48 million people are afflicted annually, with 128,000 hospitalized and 3,000 dying. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. has suffered a year of falling sales as a result of several outbreaks. In October, Wal-Mart started tracking two products using blockchain: a packaged produce item in the U.S., and pork in China. While only two items were included, the test involved thousands of packages shipped to multiple stores. The blockchain is a distributed ledger where companies doing business with one another, such as growers, distributors and retailers, can record transactions securely. The database’s strength lies in its trustworthiness: the difficulty of reversing or changing what’s been recorded. The blockchain database can also hold much more data than what retailers get today, providing tools for more detailed analysis. That could help Wal-Mart deliver food to stores faster, reducing spoilage and waste. Cutting costs is critical for all retailers. Last year, retail sales rose only 2.1 percent, the smallest gain since 2009, according to Retail Industry Leaders Association. Traditional offline retailers continue to be pressured by Amazon.com Inc. and its efficient supply chain. If the tests are successful, Wal-Mart will expand them to multiple food items in both countries, Yiannis said. “So far things are flowing smoothly and as expected,” he said. The blockchain, a technology that only came onto the scene in 2009, is already being widely tested by companies in the financial, health care and natural-resource industries. Companies like International Business Machines Corp., the Nasdaq and BHP Billiton Ltd. have deployed or are planning to deploy it to run their businesses more efficiently. Wal-Mart is using blockchain technology co-developed by IBM. In October, the company opened the Walmart Food Safety Collaboration Center in Beijing. It also announced, with IBM and Tsinghua University, a collaboration using the blockchain to improve the way food is tracked, transported and sold to Chinese consumers. If Wal-Mart adopts the blockchain to track food worldwide, it could become of the largest deployments of the technology to date. “They are setting the new standards in terms of how technology can be implemented to solve a problem that’s been with us for ages,” said Paul Chang, global supply chain subject matter expert at IBM. 15656483 View next article in Business     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

(Photo by Michael Thomas) Shoppers will still have plenty of options to seek out deals at retailers immediately after their Thanksgiving meal this year, even though the largest mall operator in St. Louis won’t be open on the holiday. Target, Kohl’s and Sears will open their doors at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving, and Walmart’s in-store sales begin at 6 p.m. Most Toys R Us, Best Buy and Macy’s stores will open at 5 p.m., and J.C. Penney is hoping to attract shoppers early with a 3 p.m. opening. “We pay associates double-time on Thanksgiving, and we have more people sign up for it than needed,” said Paul Lemmon, general manager of the J.C. Penney at South County Center. The store plans to offer platters of food for its employees around the clock to make it through the night as it remains open past midnight and into Black Friday. J.C. Penney will be the only store in the mall open in the middle of the night, as another anchor, Macy’s, plans to close at 2 a.m. and reopen on Friday morning at 5. Many retailers have scaled back their overnight hours in recent years, including Best Buy, which will close at 1 a.m. on Friday and reopen at 8 a.m. “In 2013, our stores stayed open all night,” said Best Buy spokeswoman Bianca Jones. “Since then, we made the decision to close for several hours. This allows us to clean, restock and reorganize our stores in time for our Friday opening.” Tennessee-based CBL & Associates Properties is closing its malls across the country for Thanksgiving, including its local malls: West County Center, South County Center, Mid Rivers Mall and St. Clair Square. Those malls will open at 6 a.m. on Friday. Mall leaders say they want to give employees the chance to spend time with family on Thanksgiving after several years of being open on the holiday. Chesterfield Mall also will be closed on Thanksgiving and open Friday at 6 a.m. The mall closures on Thanksgiving won’t interrupt the shopping plans of Betty Myers, 66, of Prairie du Rocher, Ill., who was shopping with her daughter Barbie Curten at the Galleria on Friday. “Thanksgiving is a day for family,” Myers said. Early discounts Shoppers’ email inboxes and mailboxes are flooded this time of year with retailers’ ads proclaiming Black Friday discounts available several days and even weeks before the big shopping day that traditionally kicks off the holiday shopping season. “There are a lot of retailers right now already doing sales, with some as good as the Black Friday sales, and we’re definitely seeing the volume of shoppers has begun to increase,” said CBL local marketing director Sean Phillips. “We didn’t see any incremental sales increases by being open on Thanksgiving. Rather, the traffic and sales volume was just spread out over a two-day period.” To attract customers on Black Friday, CBL malls are offering shoppers the chance to win shopping sprees ranging from $250 to $500. CBL also spent “in the six figures” on new holiday décor at West County Center to replace trees, lights and Santa’s seating area in use since 2002 when the mall reopened following a massive redevelopment. Several other malls will be open on Thanksgiving evening, including the two outlet malls in Chesterfield, St. Louis Galleria and Alton Square Mall. At Walmart, the retailer is offering nearly all of its Black Friday deals available in stores on its website beginning just after midnight on Thanksgiving, said Mari Matthes, store manager of the Kirkwood Walmart. Customers can either have the merchandise shipped or they can pick it up in stores. “This year, we’ve dramatically increased the amount of Black Friday merchandise allocated to Walmart.com, by 50 percent,” said spokeswoman Danit Marquardt. A lot of green Holiday purchases made online in the U.S. are expected to surpass the $100 billion mark for the first time, according to market research firm Forrester Research, based in Cambridge, Mass. It forecast online sales of $112 billion, a 13 percent increase from last year. Online sales generally total about 12 percent of annual retail sales, according to Forrester, but that figure jumps to 16 percent in November and December.

Check our People in Business See how St. Louis stocks are faring Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis “While Black Friday and the days leading up to Christmas are the most important shopping days for brick-and-mortar stores, Cyber Monday (the Monday following Thanksgiving) is the biggest online shopping event,” Forrester’s senior analyst Susan Wu wrote in a recent research report. La Royce Gaines, 44, of St. Louis, was shopping Friday afternoon for a friend’s birthday gift at the St. Louis Galleria, but she said she plans to stay far away from malls on Thanksgiving and Black Friday and shop for holiday gifts online only. “I hate fighting for parking, and the long lines are frustrating,” she said. Holiday sales are expected to rise to $655.8 billion in November and December, a 3.6 percent increase from 2015, according to the National Retail Federation, which bases its forecast on consumer credit, disposable personal income and previous monthly retail sales. The figures don’t include autos, gas or restaurant sales. The unemployment rate fell in October to 4.9 percent and on Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported retail sales rose 0.8 percent in October. “October’s strong sales and September’s upward revisions show that consumer spending improved despite the headwinds from the polarizing election and warmer than normal weather,” retail federation Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said in a statement. “Recent solid wage gains and other fundamentals are generating uplift, positioning consumers and retailers for the healthy holiday season (National Retail Federation) is forecasting.” Consumers plan to spend an average of $935.58 this holiday season on presents, food, flowers, decorations and greeting cards, according to the federation’s annual consumer spending survey. One area that’s growing is self-spending, or buying discounted goods for yourself during the Black Friday sales. Consumers plan to spend $139.61 on self-spending during the holidays, the second highest amount in the survey’s 13-year history. The record was in 2012, when consumer self-spending totaled $140.43. Still, some consumers feel cautious about their finances. Forty-seven percent of respondents said their household finances are strained, according to a survey conducted by Chicago-based market research firm IRI. “Consumers are really trying to keep their budgets in check,” said Susan Viamari, IRI vice president of thought leadership. Despite consumer caution, shoppers are willing to buy unplanned splurge items. According to the IRI survey, even 13 percent of those with strained finances said they would buy an additional or unplanned item. Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Picture: ISTOCK Portland — If you shop at Wal-Mart, you might be buying packaged produce unlike any ever sold in a US store. The sliced apples or cut broccoli — the merchant will not say what’s involved exactly — are being used to test blockchain, a new database technology. If successful, the trial could change how Wal-Mart Stores, which serves some 260-million customers a week, monitors food and takes action when something goes wrong. That could spur big leaps in food safety, cut costs and save lives. Like most merchants, the world’s largest retailer struggles to identify and remove food that has been recalled.

"It gives them an ability to have an accounting from origin to completion," said Marshal Cohen, an analyst at researcher NPD Group. "If there’s an issue with an outbreak of E.coli, this gives them an ability to immediately find where it came from. That’s the difference between days and minutes." It is also the difference between pulling a few tainted packages and yanking all the spinach from hundreds of stores, according to Frank Yiannas, vice president of food safety at Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart. Insurance giants hope blockchain can help them streamline operations "With blockchain, you can do strategic removals, and let consumers and companies have confidence," Yiannas said. "We believe that enhanced traceability is good for other aspects of the food systems. We hope you could capture other important attributes that would inform decisions around food flows, and even get more efficient at it." More than 1,000 foodborne outbreaks investigated by state and local health departments are reported each year, according to the Centre for Disease Control & Prevention. The CDC estimates roughly 48-million people are afflicted annually, with 128,000 hospitalised and 3,000 dying. Chipotle Mexican Grill has suffered a year of falling sales as a result of several outbreaks. Packaged produce In October, Wal-Mart started tracking two products using blockchain: a packaged produce item in the US, and pork in China. While only two items were included, the test involved thousands of packages shipped to multiple stores. The blockchain is a distributed ledger where companies doing business with each other — such as growers, distributors and retailers — can record transactions securely. The database’s strength lies in its trustworthiness: the difficulty of reversing or changing what has been recorded. The blockchain database can also hold much more data than what retailers get today, providing tools for more detailed analysis. That could help Wal-Mart deliver food to stores faster, reducing spoilage and waste. Cutting costs is critical for all retailers. Last year, retail sales rose only 2.1%, the smallest gain since 2009, according to Retail Industry Leaders’ Association. Traditional offline retailers continue to be pressured by Amazon.com and its efficient supply chain. Wider application? If the tests are successful, Wal-Mart will expand them to multiple food items in both countries, Yiannis said. "So far things are flowing smoothly and as expected," he said. Wal-Mart has been at the forefront of adopting new technologies before. It began installing new chip-card readers at US checkout counters 10 years before the deadline mandated by credit-card networks like Visa and Mastercard. This summer, it took Walmart Pay nationwide, becoming one of the first large retailers to launch its own mobile-payment service. It is also expanding its online grocery delivery service. The blockchain, a technology that only came onto the scene in 2009, is already being widely tested by companies in the financial, healthcare and natural-resource industries. Bold forecasts, but the blockchain numbers do not add up Blockchain industry is either hugely underresourced or hugely overoptimistic. Probably both, write Lionel Laurent and Elaine He Opinion 2 months ago Five tech trends to look out for in 2017 Advances that will revolutionise the way companies do business Lifestyle 1 month ago Watch out for the internet of things Artificial intelligence, and augmented and virtual reality could allow businesses to make better decisions in years to come Companies 1 month ago Companies like International Business Machines, the Nasdaq and BHP Billiton have deployed or are planning to deploy it to run their businesses more efficiently. Wal-Mart is using blockchain technology co-developed by IBM. In October, the company opened the Walmart Food Safety Collaboration Centre in Beijing. It also announced, with IBM and Tsinghua University, a collaboration using the blockchain to improve the way food is tracked, transported and sold to Chinese consumers. If Wal-Mart adopts the blockchain to track food worldwide, it could become of the largest deployments of the technology to date. "They are setting the new standards in terms of how technology can be implemented to solve a problem that’s been with us for ages," said Paul Chang, global supply chain subject matter expert at IBM.

But there’s another, equally insidious means by which extreme beliefs formerly relegated to the lunatic fringe are being woven into the fabric of mainstream society. That’s right—Walmart is now selling Burzum T-shirts. In all fairness, the shirts are being sold through an outside seller, Rockabilia, on Walmart’s website, and aren’t actually available in Walmart stores. (Amazon also sells the exact same shirt, for the record.) Sellers on Walmart’s website are vetted, although it’s not clear how (Walmart’s site says its “verification process is proprietary and confidential”), and considering the shirt doesn’t have “THIS ARTIST HAS MADE SOME WORRYING STATEMENTS ABOUT JEWS” printed on it in bold letters, it’s possible that Walmart’s secret marketplace tribunal has no idea who the hell Burzum is and what he stands for. Then again, this is an Arkansas-based corporation operating in the year 2016, when the quintessentially Burzum-esque pastimes of hate crimes and church burnings are on the rise. Maybe Walmart knows exactly what it’s doing after all. Thanks to reader Patrick Folz for the tip.

Walmart stores will carry $25 Sling TV gift cards, while Best Buy and GameStop will offer them in increments up to $100. The cards, also offered at Sling.com and through  eGifter, can be redeemed online.   On the device side, Sling TV is offering Apple TV boxes for $89 (versus a retail price of $149) to customers who prepay for three months of service, and 50% off a Roku Premiere+ (usually $100) under the same prepay option. It’s also offering a free Roku Streaming Stick when subs pony up for three months of service.   Roku has some of its own deals on the way:   -Roku Streaming Stick at Best Buy and other major retailers starting Nov. 20 for $35.99 (down from $49.99). -Price cut on the Roku Express+ exclusively at Walmart for $25 (down from $39.99) starting Nov. 24. -The Roku 2 for $44.99 exclusively at Kohl’s starting Nov. 21. -The Roku 3 for $49.99 exclusively at Best Buy starting Nov. 24.   The CTA said it expects a record 116 Americans – or about 47% of the adult population, will purchase tech or tech accessories during Black Friday Week.   Its 2016 Pre-Black Friday Survey anticipated a 10% jump in the number of U.S. adults planning to buy tech products from the Monday before Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday (November 21-28, 2016).   “By all accounts, the 2016 Black Friday week looks like it will be a record breaker for tech,” said Shawn DuBravac, Ph.D., chief economist, CTA, in a statement.  “Even with delayed promotions from retailers and manufacturers, and signs of pre-election uncertainty, we expect consumer enthusiasm for technology purchases during the holidays to be higher than ever.”     CTA said the top 10 tech products shoppers plan to buy are:   Televisions  Laptop computers  Smartphones  Videogame consoles Tablet computers  Headphones  Tech accessories   DVD or Blu-ray Disc players  Digital cameras  Wearables Among other more specific categories, CTA expects 1.2 million drones to be sold in the U.S. during the Q4 holiday season, as well as 700,000 VR headsets, and 4.5 million 4K/Ultra HD TVs.  Want to read more stories like this?

Skip to content Military Technologies pr @ satprnews.com Wrangler®, George Strait Concert Live Stream Generates More Than 14 Million Impressions GREENSBORO, N.C.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Wrangler teamed up with country music icon George Strait to bring fans his first-ever live-streamed performance from Texas’ historic Gruene Hall when he returned to the storied stage Wednesday night for the first time in 34 years. Country music fans tuned in to WranglerNetwork.com from all around the world covering 42 countries and generating more than 14 million media impressions, surpassing the platform’s previous viewership records. The momentous show was in celebration of Strait’s impressive three-disc, 56-track collection, Strait Out of the Box: Part 2, available today, exclusively at Walmart and Walmart.com. In addition to the online crowd and the invitation-only audience inside the 138-year-old dance hall, scores of fans surrounded the hall’s open-air perimeter to catch a glimpse of the 28-song set. A lucky few – including fellow Universal Music Group Nashville recording artist Jon Pardi and Texas recording artists and friends of Wrangler Casey Donahew and Aaron Watson – watched from inside the intimate venue. Gruene Hall has not only served as a starting point for Strait’s career, but was also featured on the album covers for Strait’s 2009 Twang album along with his 1981 debut album, Strait Country. “This was an event we may never again see in the history of music,” said Craig Errington, vice president of marketing, Wrangler. “We’re honored to be able to bring such a monumental moment involving the King of Country Music to hundreds of thousands of fans through the Wrangler Network.” This event kicked off an innovative music content agreement between Wrangler and Universal Music Group Nashville (UMGN) promising viewers curated content available exclusively through Wrangler Network. Production is slated to include acoustic performances from top UMG Nashville artists and lifestyle vignettes featuring both legendary and rising talent. The Wrangler-George Strait relationship dates back to the 80s and has become one of the longest-running brand-artist partnerships in the history of country music. This week, Wrangler announced a seven-year extension to the pair’s licensing agreement for the signature Wrangler George Strait Cowboy Cut Collection, which will expand to include women’s styles in 2017.

But there is at least one sci-fi technology that is aiming to make a breakthrough into your living room: virtual reality. Companies big and small are betting that holiday shoppers will get the appeal of being able to pop on a headset and immerse their eyes and ears – and sometimes their hands and feet – in another world. Google, Sony, Samsung, Facebook and HTC are among the major manufacturers that have put virtual reality products, mostly for playing games, on the market in the past several months. And retailers such as Walmart and Best Buy are building the excitement by setting up demonstration areas in their stores so consumers can get a good feel for these unfamiliar devices. “For most people . . . this will be their first real opportunity to play with or experience virtual reality,” said Clifton Dawson, chief executive of the market research firm Greenlight VR. “What is really important here is the reaction we’ll see from consumers who walk in these stores and get educated about it for the first time.” Advertisement Continue reading That could make this holiday season a critical period for VR, which is trying to prove it’s not just a gimmick like some gaming trends before it. (Remember the Wii and the Kinect?) Research firm IDC estimates that consumers – particularly gamers – will snap up 9.6 million virtual reality headsets by the end of the year, spending about $2.6 billion. Gamers, Dawson said, are an obvious key market to watch but so are those looking to use the virtual reality headsets for a family purchase, to replace screen time spent together on the computer to share funny videos or websites, or watching television. Greg Hall, Walmart’s senior vice president for entertainment, said he expects that gaming will remain tech’s big draw in the near term – but people are “warming up” to virtual reality. “We like the growth,” he said. “We like VR and think it’s got some nice legs for us.” The full potential of the virtual reality market is still quite a few years away, analysts say. And, in a reversal of the timeline that characterized technologies such as desktops, laptops and cellphones, the appetite for virtual reality is expected to start with average people buying them for their own personal use before the devices break into the business world. Greenlight VR believes the trend will be driven by consumer adoption through 2019, but that applications for business – including education, training and telecommuting – will start to make up the lion’s share of the market after that. The company projects that VR will become a $36 billion industry within the next decade. — Given how early in the VR trend we are, there’s a surprising variety of virtual reality headsets on the market. They come in two main types: Some are self-contained and are used primarily for high-end video games; they allow you to step completely into the virtual world and interact with it. Others work only with your smartphone, and are better suited to passively viewing specially designed 360-degree photos and videos – a super-modern update of the 19th-century stereoscopes that used to show kids slides of the wider world. If you’re skeptical of virtual reality but are intrigued by more immersive digital experiences, you may want to consider one of the latter type – say the Google Cardboard viewer. It works with smartphones up to six inches high and costs just $15. Other manufacturers are selling cardboard viewers online for even less – some as little as $5. Advertisement Continue reading These are good stocking stuffers for those who want to dip a toe in the virtual reality world, or for families with lots of kids who all want their own viewers. (There’s a reason Google has marketed these heavily to classrooms.) News organizations and other outlets post photos and videos for Google Cardboard on social media, and there are also apps for Android and iOS that work with the viewer to send users on virtual trips around the world, for example, or put them on stage with Paul McCartney in concert. For a little more polish, you can step up to something like the Google Daydream View or the Samsung Gear VR, which still run off the smartphone but provide a higher-quality experience. The Daydream View, Google’s $79 cloth and plastic headset, also comes with a remote that will let you play and interact with some basic games. And it’s much more comfortable to use – it stays put on your head with a strap, so you don’t have to hold it up. The Samsung Gear VR is also powered by a smartphone, but it has to be a Galaxy smartphone – specifically, the Galaxy S6 and newer models. With a touch-sensitive control pad on the side of the goggles, the Gear VR is a better choice for light gaming and has a number of high-profile titles including “Minecraft.” At $99, it’s far pricier than a cardboard reader, but it’s a far better experience. — If you’re super-serious and want something that actually lets you interact with the digital world, there are essentially three headset models to choose from: the HTC Vive, the PlayStation VR and the Oculus Rift. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Both the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift will require connection to a high-end personal computer to work properly – a computer that itself could cost users at least $1,000 to put together if they don’t have a VR-ready computer already. There are some hidden costs as well. The $799 HTC Vive, for example, does an amazing job of tricking your senses into believing that you’re in a digital world. You really feel as if you can interact with the virtual environment, and several clever software tricks mean that you don’t ever find yourself groping blind for a dropped game controller. One reason it’s so effective is it gives you a lot of in-world space in which to move, and a lot of sensors with which to track those movements. The downside? You have to give up a lot of real-world space: a suggested minimum of 5 feet by 6.5 feet. You’ll also have to find room to plug in seven pieces of equipment: the computer, monitor, headset, chargers and sensors. That’s fine for a man-cave, but not so much for a studio apartment. Advertisement Continue reading The $599 Rift doesn’t require as much space. In fact, some of its best experiences take place when you’re seated, which means it can be used in a normal office or living room. Its pair of hand controllers, called the Oculus Touch, also let you interact smoothly with the digital world, though they’re not always quite as sensitive – or easy to find when dropped – as those of the Vive. The Rift shines, however, in the overall quality of its software. As one of the first companies to raise mainstream awareness of virtual reality, Oculus took pains to minimize some of the more unpleasant side effects of moving through a VR world, with rock-solid tracking that should keep all but the most sensitive player from feeling too much motion sickness. Finally, Sony’s PlayStation VR has the advantage of working automatically with the PlayStation 4 and the newly released PlayStation 4 Pro. That means it doesn’t require an extra computer and runs off the game console that its target audience knows and probably already owns. Among these three high-end headsets, PlayStation VR is also the most comfortable to wear for long periods of time. And it’s just $400 – though you’ve already paid a few hundred for your PlayStation. If you really want to buy a VR headset but are still having trouble figuring out what works for you, don’t forget to compare each headset’s unique catalog of games first, to narrow down their options. Or you could take a year or two to think about it. While the hype machine is in full force right now, and consumers are responding, that doesn’t mean that failing to buy a VR headset this year will make you the lamest house on the block. Even VR evangelists don’t see the technology truly becoming mainstream for another couple of years, and that’s if all goes well. So if you postpone the decision, you may not be on the cutting edge this holiday season; but you may also save yourself some money and space if the analysts’ forecasts are wrong. holiday-tech Share Tweet LinkedIn Print Subscribe More News Suggested Stories: Tech to augment retail shopping – Jan 26, 2014 How retail stores are using virtual reality to make shopping more fun – Apr 20, 2016 Mall of America is stepping up its digital game with virtual reality, robots – Nov 2, 2016 This physician is using virtual reality to treat patients with dementia – Nov 17, 2016 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases pr @ satprnews.com Wrangler®, George Strait Concert Live Stream Generates More Than 14 Million Impressions GREENSBORO, N.C.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Wrangler teamed up with country music icon George Strait to bring fans his first-ever live-streamed performance from Texas’ historic Gruene Hall when he returned to the storied stage Wednesday night for the first time in 34 years. Country music fans tuned in to WranglerNetwork.com from all around the world covering 42 countries and generating more than 14 million media impressions, surpassing the platform’s previous viewership records. The momentous show was in celebration of Strait’s impressive three-disc, 56-track collection, Strait Out of the Box: Part 2, available today, exclusively at Walmart and Walmart.com. In addition to the online crowd and the invitation-only audience inside the 138-year-old dance hall, scores of fans surrounded the hall’s open-air perimeter to catch a glimpse of the 28-song set. A lucky few – including fellow Universal Music Group Nashville recording artist Jon Pardi and Texas recording artists and friends of Wrangler Casey Donahew and Aaron Watson – watched from inside the intimate venue. Gruene Hall has not only served as a starting point for Strait’s career, but was also featured on the album covers for Strait’s 2009 Twang album along with his 1981 debut album, Strait Country. “This was an event we may never again see in the history of music,” said Craig Errington, vice president of marketing, Wrangler. “We’re honored to be able to bring such a monumental moment involving the King of Country Music to hundreds of thousands of fans through the Wrangler Network.” This event kicked off an innovative music content agreement between Wrangler and Universal Music Group Nashville (UMGN) promising viewers curated content available exclusively through Wrangler Network. Production is slated to include acoustic performances from top UMG Nashville artists and lifestyle vignettes featuring both legendary and rising talent.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Hayley Peterson (hpeterson@businessinsider.com) Nov 18th 2016 4:10PM Whole Foods is taking some cues from Walmart in its latest effort to shed its "whole paycheck" image. The grocery chain is now stamping its paper shopping bags with a familiar tagline: "great everyday low prices." The tagline is familiar because it's nearly identical to the famous "everyday low prices" slogan that has been at the center of Walmart's marketing strategy for the last 50 years. SEE MORE: Here's how much Donald Trump made on 'The Apprentice' The concept behind the strategy and tagline is this: Customers don't need to wait for coupons or sales to shop at Walmart, because Walmart always offers the lowest prices. Many retailers have attempted to copy that concept over the years, but few have been successful. Most retailers resort to the more commonly used promotional strategy known as "high-low" marketing that's marked by frequent sales and coupons. 12 PHOTOS 11 best things to buy at Whole Foods See Gallery 11 best things to buy at Whole Foods Freshly baked bread  Photo: Getty 365 Everyday Value Greek Yogurt Photo: Getty Speciality cheeses Photo: Getty Oats, grains and beans in the DIY bulk section Photo: Getty Frozen foods, i.e. pizza and turkey burgers  Photo: Getty Alternative milk products Photo credit: Getty Frozen berries Photo: Shutterstock Raisins and dry fruit in the DIY bulk section Photo: Getty Spices in the DIY bulk section  Photo: Getty 365 Everyday Value Olive Oil Photo: Getty Freshly baked goods from the bakery section  Photo: Shutterstock Up Next See Gallery Discover More Like This of SEE ALL BACK TO SLIDE SHOW CAPTION + HIDE CAPTION – It's unclear whether Whole Foods was intentionally copying Walmart's tagline on the shopping bags, or if it was simply an oversight. The company did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment on this story. Whole Foods first started referring to "everyday low prices" last year when it announced the rollout of its cheaper chain of stores, called 365 by Whole Foods Market. In a press release, the company said "the new stores will offer convenience and everyday low prices on natural and organic products." EXPLORE MORE: Retail expert reveals Black Friday shopping secrets Whole Foods launched the 365 chain, in part, to enable the company to reach more lower-income, urban markets where a traditional Whole Foods store is less likely to succeed. Now, in the face of declining same-store sales at its traditional stores, Whole Foods is shifting the "everyday low prices" strategy to its namesake chain, which has struggled with the perception that its food is overpriced, therefore earning the nickname "whole paycheck." The company has dropped prices to try and better compete with the growing number of retailers now offering natural and organic foods. But sales at stores open at least a year are still falling. Whole Foods' same-store sales dropped 2.6% in the most recent quarter.

Denise Collier-Bailey said she noticed two men sitting the vestibule on her way into the Walmart store in Short Pump, and once she was inside her daughter asked a surprising question: "Did you see that deer in the shopping cart?" The pair double-backed and captured photos of the deer, which they said was dripping blood on the floor. "It's just one of those crazy Walmart pictures," Collier-Bailey told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. "If I hadn't been there to witness it myself, I wouldn't have believed it." A Walmart spokesman confirmed the incident and said a store manager told the men to take their deer out of the building. He said the deer was never taken into any shopping areas of the store. Lee Walker of the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries said the men might have been trying to follow state law by having their deer checked in, but Walmart is not an approved checking station "It appears that they were trying to follow the law by checking in the harvested deer, but were not at an approved check station," Walker told WTVR-TV. "In most cases hunters do not bring harvested game actually into an approved checked station, but rather have someone from the store come out to verify the harvest and to record the needed information."

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Nov 18, 2016 at 12:40PM Warren Buffett's forever-style investing approach has made him one of the planet's wealthiest people and the poster child of long-term investing. His tremendous success over the past 50 years suggests that investors ought to pay attention to what stocks he's buying, but it also suggests that they might want to focus even more on what stocks he's selling. Fortunately, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) (NYSE:BRK-A) files a 13F report with the SEC that shows what he's been selling, and according to the most recent filing, Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU), Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT), and Deere & Co. (NYSE:DE) have all fallen out of favor with the Oracle of Omaha. Read on to learn more about these companies, why Warren Buffett might be selling shares, and whether or not you should follow his footsteps away from the stocks. Image source: Suncor Energy. Giving up on oil sands Warren Buffett sold 7.7 million shares of Suncor Energy in the second quarter and in the third quarter, he unloaded the rest of his remaining 22.3 million shares. His decision to sell shares in the large Canadian oil-sands player might have stemmed from increasing concern that global oil and gas prices would remain under pressure for the foreseeable future. Rising U.S. production has caused oil and gas prices to slump significantly in the past year, and that's taken a toll on companies like Suncor that make their money producing, refining, and marketing oil products. While the company earned over $4 billion a few years ago, its net loss totals $1.6 billion over the past 12 months: SU Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts. Warren Buffett's decision could also have been influenced by Suncor's spending plans. In June, Suncor diluted investors with a 82.2 million share offering that raised $2.9 billion in capital. Suncor plans on using the money for acquisitions. Ultimately, Suncor could swing back to a profit if oil and gas prices bounce back. Its M&A (mergers and acquisitions) plans could also pay off long-term. Nevertheless, uncertainty related to both of these factors appears to have convinced Buffett that it's better to wait and watch from the sidelines. Cooling off on competition Wal-Mart has been a Warren Buffett holding for years, but he's soured on the stock this past year in the face of rising competition from online retail giant Amazon.com. Berkshire Hathaway sold 4 million shares of Wal-Mart late last year, another 15 million shares in the second quarter, and an additional 27.3 million shares in the third quarter. The pace of Buffett's selling suggests to me that he plans to sell his remaining 12.9 million shares before the end of this year. If that's the case, then it marks a seismic shift in his opinion of the company, which has been steadily losing wallet share to online retailers. In a bid to keep those competitors at bay, Wal-Mart has taken a hard line with suppliers lately that may indicate a profit-unfriendly price war is afoot. Now that we're bumping up on the ever-important holiday shopping season, Warren Buffett's selling doesn't add confidence that Wal-Mart can fend off its online rival anytime soon, and that could be reason enough for you to head for the exit too. Image source: Deere & Co. Plowing up less profit Until recently, Warren Buffett had been increasing Berkshire Hathaway's exposure to Deere & Co. However, Warren Buffett used some of Deere's rally this past summer to pare back his stake in the farm-machinery Goliath. Warren Buffett sold 874,185 shares in Deere & Co. in the third quarter, reducing his stake by 3.98% to 21.1 million shares. Despite the selling, Berkshire Hathaway remains Deere's biggest institutional investor, but that could change if Warren Buffett's outlook on grain prices and farm income shifts, due to the election of Donald Trump as America's next president. Although Deere & Co. shares are up 22% this year, the company's profit has slumped substantially as farm income has declined to its lowest point since the Great Recession. Through the first nine months of the year, Deere & Co.'s $1.24 billion profit was considerably lower than the $1.59 billion profit it posted in the comparable period of 2015. Deere & Co.'s global equipment sales declined 14% year over year in Q3, suggesting that slowing machinery demand continues to drag on the bottom line. So far, Warren Buffett has looked beyond this year's slide in demand and profit, toward rising global food demand driven by an increasingly larger population. Now that Trump's secured the White House, Deere's potential to tap into that opportunity might change. The company could benefit from rising infrastructure spending, but a strong dollar and a trade war with China, Mexico, and Canada could offset much, if not all, of that benefit. Overall, it's anyone's guess how Warren Buffett will weigh these competing factors, so investors will want to keep close tabs on Berkshire Hathaway's 13F over the next couple quarters to see whether his selling accelerates.

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Nov 18, 2016 at 12:40PM Warren Buffett's forever-style investing approach has made him one of the planet's wealthiest people and the poster child of long-term investing. His tremendous success over the past 50 years suggests that investors ought to pay attention to what stocks he's buying, but it also suggests that they might want to focus even more on what stocks he's selling. Fortunately, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) (NYSE:BRK-A) files a 13F report with the SEC that shows what he's been selling, and according to the most recent filing, Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU), Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT), and Deere & Co. (NYSE:DE) have all fallen out of favor with the Oracle of Omaha. Read on to learn more about these companies, why Warren Buffett might be selling shares, and whether or not you should follow his footsteps away from the stocks. Image source: Suncor Energy. Giving up on oil sands Warren Buffett sold 7.7 million shares of Suncor Energy in the second quarter and in the third quarter, he unloaded the rest of his remaining 22.3 million shares. His decision to sell shares in the large Canadian oil-sands player might have stemmed from increasing concern that global oil and gas prices would remain under pressure for the foreseeable future. Rising U.S. production has caused oil and gas prices to slump significantly in the past year, and that's taken a toll on companies like Suncor that make their money producing, refining, and marketing oil products. While the company earned over $4 billion a few years ago, its net loss totals $1.6 billion over the past 12 months: SU Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts. Warren Buffett's decision could also have been influenced by Suncor's spending plans. In June, Suncor diluted investors with a 82.2 million share offering that raised $2.9 billion in capital. Suncor plans on using the money for acquisitions. Ultimately, Suncor could swing back to a profit if oil and gas prices bounce back. Its M&A (mergers and acquisitions) plans could also pay off long-term. Nevertheless, uncertainty related to both of these factors appears to have convinced Buffett that it's better to wait and watch from the sidelines. Cooling off on competition Wal-Mart has been a Warren Buffett holding for years, but he's soured on the stock this past year in the face of rising competition from online retail giant Amazon.com. Berkshire Hathaway sold 4 million shares of Wal-Mart late last year, another 15 million shares in the second quarter, and an additional 27.3 million shares in the third quarter. The pace of Buffett's selling suggests to me that he plans to sell his remaining 12.9 million shares before the end of this year. If that's the case, then it marks a seismic shift in his opinion of the company, which has been steadily losing wallet share to online retailers. In a bid to keep those competitors at bay, Wal-Mart has taken a hard line with suppliers lately that may indicate a profit-unfriendly price war is afoot. Now that we're bumping up on the ever-important holiday shopping season, Warren Buffett's selling doesn't add confidence that Wal-Mart can fend off its online rival anytime soon, and that could be reason enough for you to head for the exit too. Image source: Deere & Co. Plowing up less profit Until recently, Warren Buffett had been increasing Berkshire Hathaway's exposure to Deere & Co. However, Warren Buffett used some of Deere's rally this past summer to pare back his stake in the farm-machinery Goliath. Warren Buffett sold 874,185 shares in Deere & Co. in the third quarter, reducing his stake by 3.98% to 21.1 million shares. Despite the selling, Berkshire Hathaway remains Deere's biggest institutional investor, but that could change if Warren Buffett's outlook on grain prices and farm income shifts, due to the election of Donald Trump as America's next president.

LOUIS (KPLR) – The union representing local grocery store workers is taking aim on an easy target. UFCW Local 655 hopes to exploit Stan Kroenke’s ties to Walmart in an attempt to win over customers for Dierbergs, Schnucks, and Shop ‘n Save stores. “He is the Grinch that stole our football team,” said David Coog, President UFCW Local 655. The union is spending $500,000 on a television and radio ad campaign. One of those ads encourages shoppers support stores with union workers instead of Walmart. The ad calls Kroenke a “Walmart billionaire” and makes reference to the fact he moved the St. Louis Rams to Los Angeles. It’s no secret union supporters and Walmart have been at odds over the years. UFCW Local 655 recently settled a rocky contract negotiation with Schnucks. Kroenke married into the Walmart family and built his own fortune in part by developing strip malls. Many of the developments were anchored with a Walmart store. “We’ll be running one week of heavy television commercials backed up by radio spots and then going back and forth between TV and radio through the holiday season,” Cook said. Fox 2 News reached out to Stan Kroenke’s representatives for comment but we have not received a response. Walmart sent our station the below statement and mapped out some of its economic impact in Missouri. The retailer reports it employs 43,646 associates in Missouri and supports nearly 59,953 supplier jobs. Walmart reports its foundation has donated $42.7 million in cash and in-kind donations during the 2016 fiscal year, and paid $96.9 million in taxes in Missouri during the 2016 fiscal year. “More than 13,000 people in the St. Louis area are working at Walmart this holiday season, helping their neighbors save time and money as they shop. We’re proud of what they do every day to take care of their community, and we appreciate their continued focus on providing great service to customers during this busy time of year.” Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Have a news tip?

Now that Trump’s secured the White House, Deere’s potential to tap into that opportunity might change. The company could benefit from rising infrastructure spending, but a strong dollar and a trade war with China, Mexico, and Canada could offset much, if not all, of that benefit.

 Whole Foods is copying Walmart to try and get rid of its 'whole paycheck’ image Hayley Peterson Nov. 18, 2016, 12:21 PM 4,876 facebook linkedin twitter email print Business Insider Whole Foods is taking some cues from Walmart in its latest effort to shed its "whole paycheck" image. The grocery chain is now stamping its paper shopping bags with a familiar tagline: "great everyday low prices."  The tagline is familiar because it's nearly identical to the famous "everyday low prices" slogan that has been at the center of Walmart's marketing strategy for the last 50 years. The concept behind the strategy and tagline is this: Customers don't need to wait for coupons or sales to shop at Walmart, because Walmart always offers the lowest prices. Many retailers have attempted to copy that concept over the years, but few have been successful. Most retailers resort to the more commonly used promotional strategy known as "high-low" marketing that's marked by frequent sales and coupons. Every price sign in Walmart stores is tagged with the "everyday low price" tagline. Reuters It's unclear whether Whole Foods was intentionally copying Walmart's tagline on the shopping bags, or if it was simply an oversight.  The company did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment on this story. Whole Foods first started referring to "everyday low prices" last year when it announced the rollout of its cheaper chain of stores, called 365 by Whole Foods Market. In a press release, the company said "the new stores will offer convenience and everyday low prices on natural and organic products." Whole Foods launched the 365 chain, in part, to enable the company to reach more lower-income, urban markets where a traditional Whole Foods store is less likely to succeed. AP Now, in the face of declining same-store sales at its traditional stores, Whole Foods is shifting the "everyday low prices" strategy to its namesake chain, which has struggled with the perception that its food is overpriced, therefore earning the nickname "whole paycheck." The company has dropped prices to try and better compete with the growing number of retailers now offering natural and organic foods. But sales at stores open at least a year are still falling.  Whole Foods' same-store sales dropped 2.6% in the most recent quarter.

If successful, the blockchain trial could change how Wal-Mart Stores, which serves some 260 million customers a week, monitors food and takes action when something goes wrong.  (Patrick T. Fallon / Bloomberg File Photo)   By Olga KharifBloomberg Fri., Nov. 18, 2016 If you shop at Wal-Mart, you might be buying packaged produce unlike any ever sold in a U.S. store. The sliced apples or cut broccoli — the merchant won’t say exactly what’s involved — are being used to test blockchain, a new database technology. If successful, the trial could change how Wal-Mart Stores, which serves some 260 million customers a week, monitors food and takes action when something goes wrong. That could spur big leaps in food safety, cut costs and save lives. Like most merchants, the world’s largest retailer struggles to identify and remove food that’s been recalled. When a customer becomes ill, it can take days to identify the product, shipment and vendor. With the blockchain, Wal-Mart will be able to obtain crucial data from a single receipt, including suppliers, details on how and where food was grown and who inspected it. The database extends information from the pallet to the individual package. “It gives them an ability to have an accounting from origin to completion,” said Marshal Cohen, an analyst at researcher NPD Group Inc. “If there’s an issue with an outbreak of E. coli, this gives them an ability to immediately find where it came from. That’s the difference between days and minutes.” It’s also the difference between pulling a few tainted packages and yanking all the spinach from hundreds of stores, according to Frank Yiannas, vice president of food safety at Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart. Article Continued Below “With blockchain, you can do strategic removals, and let consumers and companies have confidence,” Yiannas said. “We believe that enhanced traceability is good for other aspects of the food systems. We hope you could capture other important attributes that would inform decisions around food flows, and even get more efficient at it.” More than 1,000 foodborne outbreaks investigated by state and local health departments are reported each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. The CDC estimates roughly 48 million people are afflicted annually, with 128,000 hospitalized and 3,000 dying. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. has suffered a year of falling sales as a result of several outbreaks. In October, Wal-Mart started tracking two products using blockchain: a packaged produce item in the U.S., and pork in China. While only two items were included, the test involved thousands of packages shipped to multiple stores. The blockchain is a distributed ledger where companies doing business with one another, such as growers, distributors and retailers, can record transactions securely. The database’s strength lies in its trustworthiness: the difficulty of reversing or changing what’s been recorded. The blockchain database can also hold much more data than what retailers get today, providing tools for more detailed analysis. That could help Wal-Mart deliver food to stores faster, reducing spoilage and waste. Cutting costs is critical for all retailers. Last year, retail sales rose only 2.1 per cent, the smallest gain since 2009, according to Retail Industry Leaders Association. Traditional offline retailers continue to be pressured by Amazon.com Inc. and its efficient supply chain. If the tests are successful, Wal-Mart will expand them to multiple food items in both countries, Yiannis said. “So far things are flowing smoothly and as expected,” he said. Wal-Mart has been at the forefront of adopting new technologies before. It began installing new chip-card readers at U.S. checkout counters 10 years before the deadline mandated by credit-card networks like Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. This summer, it took Walmart Pay nationwide, becoming one of the first large retailers to launch its own mobile-payment service. It’s also expanding its online grocery delivery service. The blockchain, a technology that only came onto the scene in 2009, is already being widely tested by companies in the financial, healthcare and natural-resource industries. Companies like International Business Machines Corp., the Nasdaq and BHP Billiton Ltd. have deployed or are planning to deploy it to run their businesses more efficiently. Wal-Mart is using blockchain technology co-developed by IBM. In October, the company opened the Walmart Food Safety Collaboration Center in Beijing. It also announced, with IBM and Tsinghua University, a collaboration using the blockchain to improve the way food is tracked, transported and sold to Chinese consumers. If Wal-Mart adopts the blockchain to track food worldwide, it could become of the largest deployments of the technology to date. “They are setting the new standards in terms of how technology can be implemented to solve a problem that’s been with us for ages,” said Paul Chang, global supply chain subject matter expert at IBM.

Keep reading to see which one is the better buy today. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Nov 18, 2016 at 9:35AM Two of the biggest mass merchandise retailers, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT), are often seen as competitors, even though they target different demographics. Target is best known for its "cheap chic" product line, which often includes tie-ups with designers. It focuses on categories like kids and wellness, and tends to target urban millennials. Wal-Mart, on the other hand, tends to draw lower-income consumers, and has most of its stores in suburban and rural parts of the country, especially across the South. More than half of its sales come from grocery. Both of these stocks have struggled in recent years as the bulk of the gains in retail have gone to companies like Amazon.com and Costco Wholesale. Wal-Mart and Target aren't standing still as the retail landscape changes -- both have made investments in e-commerce and adapted their physical store strategy. Let's take a closer look at how each company is doing to see which is the better buy today. Image Source: Wal-Mart.  A whole new Wal-Mart Wal-Mart has made several changes in the last two years to revamp the company and bring back sales growth. It raised its base wage to $9/hour last year and $10/hour this year, a move that will cost it $2.7 billion annually. The company expects profits to fall this year due in part to that investment, but it's helped drive same-store sales up for nine quarters in a row. In the third quarter of this year, comparable sales grew 1.2%. On the e-commerce front, it also made a splash with its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com earlier this year. Management hopes the deal will jump start online sales at Wal-Mart, thanks to Jet.com's "smart basket" technology, which lowers prices based on decisions customers make like foregoing returns or paying with a debit card. Jet Founder Marc Lore has also agreed to stay at the retailer for five years, and he's begun putting his own imprint on the company; several former e-commerce executives are leaving Wal-Mart, and he's brought in his exec from Jet.   In the third quarter, Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales jumped 21%, its best performance in over a year, and contributed 50 basis points to comparable sales growth. Looking ahead, the company is scaling back on new store openings to focus on e-commerce and improving its current fleet of stores. It's also found success with its grocery pickup program, which allows customers to order groceries on the internet and pick them up from a parking lot kiosk. Those investments are expected to return the company to profit growth by 2018. Image Source: Motley Fool.  Trying to hit the bullseye Target shares skyrocketed earlier this week after its earnings report came out, but the 7% jump was more the result of lowered expectations rather than strong results. Same-store sales fell for the second quarter in a row, but did better than expectations, dropping 0.2% against estimates of a 1.1% slide. There were other promising signs, including a 22% increase in adjusted earnings per share, and the company raised its full-year guidance, though that came after lowering it in the previous report. Online sales were up 26% in the quarter, but the company sees comparable sales roughly flat for the holiday quarter. While Target is executing in its Signature Categories, which include baby, home, and wellness, with 3% comparable sales growth, it's struggling elsewhere. Its entry into groceries has been plagued by low-volume sales, resulting in spoilage, and the company has been raising prices at a time when many of its competitors are lowering them. In fact, it promised to do a better job on implementing the second half of it "Expect More. Pay Less" slogan. The retailer has also seen several executives leave recently in what could be a sign of discord in the C-suite. Management plans to open hundreds of small-format stores in cities, and opened 10 such stores in the last quarter. Those could reach an untapped market, but competitors, namely Wal-Mart, have been unable to pull off such a transition.  CEO Brian Cornell expressed confidence in the strategy, but driving traffic to its current store fleet will continue to be the key determinant of the company's success. And the winner is... Both companies are fighting uphill battles as the retail landscape shifts, and the two stocks offer similar valuations and dividend yields. However, Wal-Mart seems to have a better strategy for long-term growth. Its acquisition of Jet.com and expansion of grocery pickup should help fuel e-commerce sales, and investments in stores should keep comparable sales increasing. Target may perform better in the near term as Wal-Mart is still forecasting flat earnings growth next year, but over the long term I'd expect Wal-Mart to be the better buy of the two.

(WMT) Stock Light on Revenue, But Can Explain View All Posts While Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) are considered the “Coke and Pepsi” of modern discount retail, they’re not nearly as similar as most people think. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) For one thing, WMT generates much more volume per quarter, about $120 billion, than TGT generates in a year, about $70 billion. Target’s results are also choppier. It had a great Christmas last year, but a massive theft of customer data by hackers in 2013 hampered results for years and resulted in a turnover of the executive suite. The history is also different. Walmart started as a discount chain, while TGT is descended from the old Dayton’s department stores, which were eventually merged with Marshall Field’s and spun out in 2004. Target is generally more corporate than WMT, which is still run in the image of entrepreneurial founder Sam Walton. Target stock is riskier, but its smaller size means it can change strategies quickly. The company has changed its strategy lately, under new CEO Brian Cornell, and investors need to understand the changes before buying Target stock. TGT Is Becoming a City Mouse Early in 2016, the big story at TGT was that it was beating WMT in e-commerce. It integrated its online store with in-store pick-ups last Christmas, growing online sales by 30%, and was planning $2.5 billion of investments in technology by 2017. 7 Stocks to Buy From the Scrap Heap Analysts were initially skeptical of it’s move, and early results were poor, but last Christmas made analysts believers of Target stock and the company is now considered an e-commerce leader. Cornell’s latest move is even bigger. He’s going to make TGT the City Mouse to Walmart’s Country Mouse. Target plans to open hundreds of small-format stores, mostly in large cities, reshaping the company’s image and real estate footprint in the process. WMT CEO Doug McMillon had tried something similar starting in 2014, opening Neighborhood Markets and planning Walmart Express stores built around gas stations, but Walmart abandoned the plan this year, closing 269 outlets. The difference between the two plans lies in where the small stores are, and who they are aiming at. While the Walmart Neighborhood Markets were in suburbs, and represented in-fill between larger Walmart SuperCenters, the new TGT stores are in the center of cities, and in college towns, highlighted by a 45,000 square-foot unit in Tribeca, in lower Manhattan. While the Neighborhood Markets were also smaller, cookie-cutter versions of WMT’s larger outlets, heavy on the groceries and mostly self-service, the new Target stores are customized to their neighborhoods and the company is investing heavily in its supply chain to get the specific goods each location needs.

Brands Cut Food Waste Food Waste Reduction Goal Gets Industry Praise Walmart, Suppliers Launch Recycling Fund Global Food Companies ‘Should Upgrade Sustainable Supply Chain Strategies’ Related Topics Food & Beverage Retail & Restaurants Sustainable Strategy & Leadership Waste & Recycling Waste Management Major companies including General Mills, Kellogg, PepsiCo, Unilever and Walmart have pledged to halve food waste and loss in their operations by 2030. The EPA and US Department of Agriculture announced the first 15 US Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions yesterday: Ahold USA, Blue Apron, Bon Appétit Management Company, Campbell Soup Company, Conagra Brands, Delhaize America, General Mills, Kellogg Company, PepsiCo, Sodexo, Unilever, Walmart, Wegman’s Food Markets, Weis Markets and Yum! Brands. “Already, Kellogg has reduced waste sent to landfill by more than 60 percent since 2005, including food waste,” said Diane Holdorf, Kellogg’s chief sustainability officer, in a statement. “We remain committed to ensuring edible food waste is donated to feed people in need, when appropriate. We also will continue our partnerships to develop sustainable agriculture programs with smallholder farmers that help prevent post-harvest loss in major ingredients relevant to Kellogg.” Each 2030 Champion has agreed to establish a baseline marking where they are today and will measure and report on their progress toward the goal. Because there are many ways to define and measure food waste, the EPA directs businesses to the Food Loss and Waste Protocol for information on defining and transparently measuring food loss and waste. The EPA estimates that more food reaches landfills and incinerators than any other single material, making up about 21 percent of the US waste stream. Reducing food waste also impacts climate change as 20 percent of total US methane emissions come from landfills. Reducing food waste can be an economic boost to companies as well. A recent study that looked at business opportunities related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals found the biggest is in reducing food waste in the value chain, which could yield up to $405 billion annually in economic benefits. The 2030 Champions announcement follows the first-ever US food loss and waste reduction goal announced in September 2015. “Reducing food waste is good for business, it’s good for the environment and it’s good for our communities,” said EPA administrator Gina McCarthy. “We need leaders in every field and every sector to help us reach our food loss goal. That’s why we’re excited to work with the 2030 Champions and others across the food retail industry as we work together to ensure that we feed families instead of landfills.” Businesses Can Save Billions by Cutting Food Waste How Campbell’s, ConAgra Foods, Yum!

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next NASHVILLE, Tenn. - A man has been recovering after being stabbed near a South Nashville Walmart. The incident happened around 11:30 p.m. Thursday at the Walmart on Nolensville Pike. According to police, the victim was stabbed in the ribs. Walmart security officers were the ones who first reported the incident. At first, firefighter paramedics examined him, but they said he refused treatment. Officers added the man also refused to tell them what had happened to cause his injury. However, officers were at the Walmart not long after the initial call on an unrelated call, and the victim from the stabbing earlier walked up and requested medical treatment.   The fire department transported him to Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Police said they believe the victim has been homeless and was staying in the woods nearby. At last check, he had still not given any additional information about what took place.

PHOTO: Zak Suhar Every website developer hopes to provide the best possible customer experience. This is especially important for retail sites, where positive customer experiences can immediately result in sales. However, most retail websites fall short of the mark. Why is that? Let's take a closer look at some of the top retail websites, analyze their strengths and weaknesses, and share some of the lessons to be learned. Evaluating 5 Retail Websites A cursory analysis of the top five retailer websites in the US — Walmart, Kroger, Costco, Walgreens and Home Depot — revealed the following issues: Slow Page Speeds Page load times are critical for retailers. Consumers expect a certain level of performance from the pages they visit, and are likely to leave pages that do not appear in a certain timeframe. For e-commerce websites, slow pages translate directly into lost sales. Surprisingly, the top two retailers, Walmart and Kroger, performed the worst in our speed tests. Some of their pages took as long as 13 seconds to load. According to Kissmetrics, 47 percent of consumers expect a web page to load in two seconds or less, and a one second delay in page response can result in a 7 percent reduction in conversions. For large retailers like Walmart and Kroger, this can result in millions of dollars in lost sales. Websites are generally slow because of third-party services and their associated DNS lookups. The top retailers employ sophisticated marketing technologies to study and forecast consumer buying patterns. They do this by adding third-party services that capture and report this information. The problem is that there are many criteria that can be analyzed, and each will often add a separate DNS lookup. Sometimes, you can track too much. Third-party services are valuable tools to today’s retail marketers, but they can be overused. Be sure to regularly monitor your page load times. If they are longer than two seconds, reduce the number of third-party services, pre-fetch DNS requests or move tracking scripts to your CDN.  Lack of Security Security is a must on retail websites. Customers are required to enter sensitive information in every transaction, and it is critical that retailers protect this information every step of the process. Given that, it's surprising that Home Depot’s main website does not use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), a standard technology for establishing a secure link between a browser and a web server. It uses encryption technology to protect all communications. To be fair, Home Depot does use SSL once you are on the transaction pages, but even parts of those pages are not secure and will trigger Mixed Content warnings in some browsers. This will leave some users wondering if the experience is secure. Home Depot should use SSL throughout its website. Its web developers might argue that they took this approach to keep the website lean and fast. That is true, but the impact is very small. If the developers implemented SSL throughout the website, they could easily offset any hit on performance by scaling and optimizing some of the images on their site.   Google recognizes the risks. Google’s popular Chrome browser — which has 42 percent market share according to NetMarketShare — is going to start warning users about SSL compliance on websites. The browser will start shaming websites that don’t have SSL on them by displaying a red “X” next to their URL to warn users of the security risks. SSL utilization also impacts rankings within Google’s search results algorithm. Poor SEO SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the collection of strategies and techniques retailers use to get their products in front of potential customers via the popular search engines (e.g., Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc.). Many customers — even avid Amazon customers — usually start their online shopping at Google because it allows them to compare prices at multiple stores. If the pricing is about the same, Amazon may earn the sale. However, if another retailer offers exceptionally pricing, then they will probably buy it there. The top five retailers we analyzed all could stand improvement based on our SEO tests. They all tend to reuse the same descriptions, headings or keywords across multiple product pages, which makes it difficult to differentiate the product pages. It's very difficult to write unique product descriptions and headers for hundreds of thousands of products. Instead, large retailers may auto-generate their descriptions and headings where they haven’t curated the SEO tags. This is an area that could offer a distinct advantage for smaller retailers. Large retailers don’t have the manpower to effectively market every product, but specialty retailers could successfully own a brand or niche. For example, a specialty kitchen supplier will never sell as many faucets as Home Depot, but it might want to own the Google keywords for specific high-end brands to drive customers to its store. Website Analysis is Critical This review of the top retailer websites revealed some very common issues that can be easily diagnosed through proper website analysis. Website analysis is an important part of the website development and maintenance process. At the end of the day, the goal is to sell as many products online as possible. That cannot be achieved without first providing a fast, safe and secure web experience. This article is based on website analysis performed in mid-October 2016.  No destructive testing occurred.

Her remarks to Congress Thursday suggest that the central bank is on track to raise interest rates at its meeting in December, one month before Trumps takes office. She said she has no plans to step down before her four-year term ends on Feb. 3, 2018, reiterated the Fed's political independence and vigorously defended tougher bank regulations established in the wake of the financial crisis. An improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising interest rates, Yellen told Congress' Joint Economic Committee. ___ America's shift to SUVs is on display at L.A. Auto Show America's shift from cars to SUVs is starting to look permanent, and automakers are scrambling to meet the demand. Toyota, Ford, Subaru, Jeep and Volkswagen are all showing new SUVs at this week's Los Angeles Auto Show. Even traditional luxury car makers like Jaguar and Alfa Romeo are debuting SUVs. Americans bought more SUVs than four-door cars for the first time last year, and the momentum is growing. But unlike the previous SUV boom, which fell victim to rising gas prices, this one is likely to stay as automakers offer more small SUVs with better fuel economy. ___ Ex-Valeant, Philidor execs arrested for fraud, conspiracy Former executives of Valeant Pharmaceuticals and a related mail-order pharmacy were charged Thursday with running a fraud-and-kickback scheme that bilked Valeant out of millions of dollars. Their arrests are part of an ongoing investigation, according to Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who said other arrests are possible. Bharara's office said it has charged Gary Tanner, a former Valeant executive, and Andrew Davenport, who had been the chief executive of Philidor, a mail-order pharmacy that is now defunct, with two counts of wire fraud, along with money laundering and conspiracy. ___ Bank stocks surge again, leading broader market higher NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose Thursday as banks resumed their steep upward climb and retailers moved higher. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen emphasized that the Fed plans to raise interest rates, which will help banks make more money from lending. Stocks started the day with small gains and moved higher following Yellen's testimony to Congress. Banks once again marched higher as investors cheered the latest indication that interest rates will rise from their current ultra-low levels. Retailers also rose after strong earnings from Best Buy, while food and household goods makers struggled after weak results from Wal-Mart and J.M. Smucker. ___ Wal-Mart's profit falls but beats estimates; revenue misses NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. saw its third-quarter profit fall more than 8 percent, dragged down as it continues to plow money into e-commerce and improving its stores. While online sales improved, overall revenue fell short of expectations as the company said it was hurt in part by falling food prices. Profit at the world's largest retailer still beat Wall Street expectations, and it lifted the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast. Investors focused on the sales, though, sending shares in the retailer down. ___ Gap's third-quarter profit drops nearly 18 percent NEW YORK (AP) — Gap's third-quarter profit fell nearly 18 percent, undercut by costs related to store closures outside North America. Gap Inc. shares fell in after-market trading Thursday as the company said the slump in the number of people visiting its stores continues as it heads into the critical holiday shopping season. Gap is facing the same problems as other fashion retailers, with shoppers buying less clothing in general and also favoring off-price chains like T.J. Maxx. But Gap is also struggling with identity problems, mired in a slump as its fashions just don't stand out in an overcrowded landscape. ___ JPMorgan Chase to pay $264 million in Chinese bribery case NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. has agreed to pay $264.4 million in fines to federal authorities to settle criminal and civil charges that it hired friends and relatives of Chinese officials in order to gain access to banking deals in that country. JPMorgan's Asia affiliate allegedly created a quid pro quo program that would hire the children and friends of high-ranking Chinese officials, regardless of the person's qualifications, in order to gain favor and win banking deals. ___ Tesla, SolarCity get shareholder approval for merger Tesla Motors got approval from investors to combine with SolarCity Corp. in an effort to expand the market for solar power and give electric car owners new options for solar charging. Shareholders of both companies backed the merger by a wide margin Thursday. The deal, first proposed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk proposed in June, has had more of a mixed reaction on Wall Street. Analysts wondered why Tesla would want to take on SolarCity while busy with its own goals. There were also complaints of a conflict of interest for Musk, who is chairman of both companies. ___ Wells Fargo sees significant slowdown in account openings NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo disclosed signs on Thursday that its customers are significantly pulling back from doing business with the bank, a reverberation of the sales practices scandal that drew a huge fine in September. Because of the timing, its data for October is the first full-picture view of customer reaction and it is not pretty. New customer account openings fell 44 percent in October from a year earlier, while account closures rose 3 percent from the previous year. The bank saw a 50 percent drop in credit card applications. ___ Verizon's AOL cutting 500 jobs, will focus on mobile, video NEW YORK (AP) — AOL is cutting about 500 jobs, or 8 percent of its workforce, as it trims back following some deals and focuses on mobile, video and data. In a memo to employees, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong says the Verizon-owned company has added 1,500 employees over the past year because of acquisitions and partnerships, and it needs to consolidate to improve operations. Armstrong says AOL will add jobs in the areas that are driving growth. ___ Sorry Trump, NY Times says subscriptions rose since election NEW YORK (AP) — The New York Times pushed back against President-elect Donald Trump, saying Thursday that its paid subscriptions have jumped since the election, despite Trump's accusations. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that the Times "is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the 'Trump phenomena.'" The Times said Thursday that it added 41,000 paid subscriptions to its newspaper and digital news products in the week since Election Day. The increase is its largest one-week rise since 2011, when it launched its digital subscription model. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average added 35.68 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 18,903.82. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 10.18 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,187.12. The Nasdaq composite added 39.39 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,333.97. Benchmark U.S. crude slid 15 cents to $45.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slipped 14 cents to $46.49 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.34 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.45 a gallon. Natural gas fell 6 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.70 per 1,000 cubic feet. ___ The first item has been corrected to read that Yellen's term ends on Feb. 3, 2018, not January 2018.

The 14-year-old girl’s body is hung upside-down in temperatures of minus 196C while awaiting still-unknown ­techniques to bring her back to life. Before she died from cancer last month, the teenager was confident of her ­immortality and predicted to her uncle she would live again 200 years from now. Today is her 20th day inside her Cryostat – a huge human Thermos flask from which she hoped one day she will emerge and be cured of her cancer. The girl’s body was flown from Britain to the US and the Cryonics Institute in Clinton Township, Michigan, last month following a bitter legal battle between her divorced parents. Read More Grandparents of girl, 14, who has been cryogenically frozen sell their house to pay the bill The Cryonics Institute in Michigan (Photo: James Breeden/Sunday Mirror) The teenager’s corpse – referred to by the firm as “a patient” – is now suspended in liquid nitrogen. The company’s chief operating officer Andy Zawacki explained: “It is almost like they float once inside,” “We store up to six patients inside each Cryostat and they are suspended upside down on their boards. Chris Bucktin and CI Director Andy Zawacki, Chief Operations Officer, with one of the boards patients are strapped on before being suspended in the tanks (Photo: James Breeden/Sunday Mirror) “Patients are wrapped in everyday normal sleeping bags, the kind you can buy at the local store. “They are nothing special but we have found they absorb liquid nitrogen very well and help preserve the body. “Each patient, while strapped to their board, is then hoisted above a Cryostat ­and we lower them in. Where the bodies are kept at the Cryonics Institute in Michigan (Photo: James Breeden/Sunday Mirror) “Their bodies are held by restraints while we leave a gap between their head and the end of the boards so they don’t touch the floor. “We have them upside-down for safety reasons so if there is a liquid nitrogen leak it will be the head that is protected most as that is at the bottom. “Effectively the bodies hang like modern mummies until we hope science will become so ­advanced they are brought back to life. Chris Bucktin in the perfusion room at MichiganÕs Cryonics Institute, where patients are prepared for vitrification (Photo: James Breeden/Sunday Mirror) “The aim is that by the time they are ­defrosted a cure will have been found for whatever killed them.” Before her death in a London hospital on October 17, her father, who the girl had not seen since 2007, was opposed to her plans to be frozen, while her mother was in support. The teen took her battle to the High Court to fight for the right for her mum to have sole control of her remains. The tank used to bring the incoming patients down to a temperature of -196C (Photo: James Breeden/Sunday Mirror) Mr Justice Peter Jackson granted the girl, referred to as JS in proceedings, her wish 11 days before she died. Her father has since revealed how bitter and destructive the family rift had been while other family members suggested JS had been brainwashed into thinking she could cheat death. The dad was banned, in line with his daughter’s wishes, from seeing her or her body as he fought his own cancer battle. Unknown to him, at one point she was only a few floors away as the two were treated in the same London hospital. The Cryonics Institute in Michigan (Photo: James Breeden/Sunday Mirror) Without a legal ban, the father could make an application to visit his daughter’s body in the US. Mr Zawacki said: “Relatives are ­allowed to visit. With cryonics we hope it works but we don’t know, so it is possible this is their final resting place. For ­relatives, it is still a loss to them, they hope it is temporary but they do like to come in. One gentleman brings flowers each year for his sister.” Asked if they would specifically allow JS’s father into the facility, Mr Zawacki said: “We would be respectful of another country’s law.” The £37,000 cost of JS’s preservation was paid by maternal grandparents. The perfusion room at MichiganÕs Cryonics Institute, where patients are prepared for vitrification (Photo: James Breeden/Sunday Mirror) But a cousin of her mother said there had been misgivings on that side of the family over her plans. Before her arrival in America, JS’s body was prepared by Cryogenic UK, the only British organisation working in the unregulated field. After she was legally pronounced dead the team cooled down her body before performing “perfusion” during which the blood is replaced with a ­medical antifreeze. She was then packed in dry ice and placed in an airtight container before being flown to Detroit airport. The tank used to bring the incoming patients down to a temperature of -196C (Photo: James Breeden/Sunday Mirror) Once at the institute, an unassuming warehouse on an industrial estate, her body was further cooled over five days before being placed in her Cryostat. The institute, one of only three such facilities in the world, has 145 human bodies. Pets are cryogenically ­frozen for a smaller fee. University lecturer Roger Eyre, 64, is one of more than 120 Brits who will be cryogenically frozen. He has signed up to America’s other facility, Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Phoenix, Arizona. Bizarrely, his mum’s head is stored there. Roger, of Plumstead, South East London, became fascinated by cryogenics when as a 15-year-old schoolboy he watched an episode of Whicker’s World called Immortality Incorporated in 1967.

Lifestyle Savvy Shopper guide to navigating Black Friday, Cyber Monday 5 Black Friday tips from our Savvy Shopper Savvy Shopper's guide to navigating Black Friday. Savvy Shopper's guide to navigating Black Friday. Natalie JosephContact Reporternjoseph@dailypress.com Every year, hundreds of people leave their homes late Thanksgiving Day or early Black Friday morning to stand in the cold for one purpose — scoring the biggest shopping deals of the year. Black Friday and Cyber Monday have solidified themselves as two of the largest shopping days of the year, causing shoppers across the nation to mark their calendars in hopes of scoring the best deals on electronics, home goods, appliances, toys and much more. The National Retail Federation (NRF) reported 74.2 million people shopped in stores on Black Friday in 2015. The NRF also reported 34.6 million shopped in stores on Thanksgiving Day. This year, the NRF predicts that holiday shopping will increase by 3.6 percent, with a majority of sales coming from shopping done on Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The NRF senior director of media relations, Ana Serafin Smith, said Black Friday weekend numbers are predicted to be similar to or stronger than in 2015. NRF reports that consumers plan to spend about $589 on gifts this holiday season. Gloucester groups join #GivingTuesday Frances Hubbard Several organizations and businesses have joined "Giving Tuesday" – a worldwide fundraising campaign that follows Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Shop Local Saturday and Cyber Monday. "We are working hard to raise funds with the online charitable giving opportunity that GivingTuesday provides," said... Several organizations and businesses have joined "Giving Tuesday" – a worldwide fundraising campaign that follows Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Shop Local Saturday and Cyber Monday. "We are working hard to raise funds with the online charitable giving opportunity that GivingTuesday provides," said... (Frances Hubbard) If you're worried you missed out on deals in 2015, WalletHub, in a news release, reported that 11 percent of deals this Black Friday are recycled from last year. It reports top retailers recycling deals are Sears (28 percent recycled), Office Depot/OfficeMax (20.5 percent) and Staples (18.2 percent). Shopping tips •Make a list. Before you get to the store, make a list of a few items you want to purchase ahead of time. This will help you keep focus, shop faster and get a better position in the checkout line so you can move on to the next store. A list also is helpful in case you find the hot deal you originally wanted is sold out, allowing you to move down your list for your second-most-wanted deal without scrambling. Crowds in Hampton Roads lined up for deals on Black Friday Thanksgiving Day. (Kaitlin McKeown) •Collect coupons. Many stores allow you to stack coupons on Black Friday, allowing you to use multiple coupons on one purchase to maximize savings. Start saving coupons now and collect the coupons you receive while shopping on Black Friday. Organize your coupons according to store and group them together in little plastic bags or with paper clips so when you get to the register, you can pull out all of your coupons for one store together, which makes checkout faster and easier. •Get in line early (especially for electronics). At almost any major retailer, lines get long fast. Most department stores only have a limited number of electronics or large door-buster items, so I suggest arriving at the retailer about an hour before the doors open. Typically stores give out tickets for electronics or appliance items while you wait in line. Once in the store, the customer then takes the ticket to the checkout counter to redeem the item, so getting there early increases your chances of getting the deal you want — and snagging a shopping cart, which is a Black Friday rarity. •Save receipts. With so many incredible deals in one place, it can be overwhelming and exciting, leading to shopping regret. Although receipts are easy to lose in the chaos of Black Friday, it is important to remember to save them just in case you want to return any impulse buys or defective items. Also, rebates are big on Black Friday, and your receipt is the key to scoring money back on some of your most expensive purchases. •Bring a shopping partner. Bringing someone with you for your Black Friday shopping adventures is important for many reasons. First, because shopping carts are so rare, a partner can help you hold shopping items. Second, the two of you can also split the shopping list to maximize your chances of getting a great item. It also helps to have someone to wait with in line. If you fly Black Friday solo, bring a smartphone or game to pass the time while waiting. Door-buster deals Big box retailers compete with one another to offer customers the best deals of the season. Depending on what you are looking for, or who you are shopping for, Black Friday shopping may take you to one store or multiple stores or may cause you to stay at home in your pajamas and shop online. Newport News shopping blogger and co-founder of blackfridaycentral.com and crazytowndeals.com, Jerry Tietjens, said the key to getting the most out of your Thanksgiving Day or Black Friday shopping is to look for multiple deals in one place. "Don't go to a store based on one deal you see in the advertisement," Tietjens said. "Stores only have like seven or eight TVs in stock, and that's usually the max. The first five people get them and that's it. Look for ads with a few Christmas gifts so you get more of what you want." Electronics One of the top deals on electronics can be found at Kohl's on Black Friday.

Black Friday online Many Black Friday deals already have begun at large online retailers such as Amazon and Groupon. According to the NRF, in 2015, 41 million people shopped online on Thanksgiving Day, and 75.3 million shopped online on Black Friday. Many stores that offer in-store Black Friday deals also will have the same deals online the morning of Thanksgiving or Black Friday, Tietjens said. "You will see a lot of those same deals pop up online first. Some of them leak in the days leading up to Black Friday," Tietjens said. "For example, a large deal that we found online is that Wal-Mart has a 55-inch 4K Smart TV for $298. Don't wait until the stores open." Like department store websites, Amazon offers Black Friday deals and is the key online retailer to look out for Thursday if you want to find discounts on electronics, home goods, furniture and a variety of other items without leaving your comfortable space. According to Tietjens, Amazon most likely will price-match large department stores. Cyber Monday Last year, 121.3 million people shopped on Cyber Monday, more than on Black Friday. This year, the NRF expects that number to increase, because large retailers are upping their Cyber Monday deals. "We noticed that retailers are offering online-only deals on purpose to compete with other online shopping deals that other retailers are offering. We see this when retailers are offering exclusive deals give them more bang for their buck," said Smith, NRF's senior director of media relations. Amazon has started its Countdown to Black Friday by releasing new deals every five minutes on its website. Amazon's best deals of the season most likely will be on Cyber Monday with discounts on clothes and electronics, specifically Amazon-made products like the Fire tablet. Also check Best Buy's website on Cyber Monday, which will have the latest 4K Ultra HD televisions on sale. Also online, find deals at Crocs (40 to 60 percent off), 30 percent off at UGGs Australia, discounted vacations at Travelocity and coupons for special offers at Target. Most stores also offer free shipping on Cyber Monday. Online shopping tips According to Tietjens, Cyber Monday is the biggest day for clothing and textiles, so explore your favorite store's website for deals ahead of time. Tietjens explained that Cyber Monday has more apparel deals than any other day of the year, and suggests that if people are looking for handbags, shoes or winter clothing, Cyber Monday is a better day to shop. He also said Cyber Monday will have deals that mirror Black Friday's on laptops, televisions, tablets, smartphones and other high-end technology devices. "We see lots of crossover with Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals. Most deals after that will depend what didn't sell on those days. Some TV prices will drop after if they didn't sell as much," Tietjens said.

Print   Email   Font Resize A Texas doctor seeks ID, closure for migrants who die crossing the border from Mexico Monica Hesse And Ricky Carioti Updated:   11/19/2016 01:54:27 PM MST (c) 2016, The Washington Post. LAREDO, Texas -- The man had been found two nights before on the brushland of a South Texas ranch, miles from the nearest sign of civilization, which was the back of a Wal-Mart. The Border Patrol agent who spotted him didn't know how long the young man had been walking before he collapsed and died, and neither did Corinne Stern, the Webb County medical examiner on whose autopsy table he now lay. He'd been carrying a backpack. The backpack would be how Stern began to piece together who the man was and how she could send him back to his family, and so, early on a Sunday morning, her assistant lined up its contents, item by item. A bottle of water, mostly empty. A cellphone, protected by a passcode. A wallet, which meant nothing: Sometimes the people who entered the country by swimming and hiking across its border did so while carrying other people's identification. A bag of corn chips, a can of tuna fish, a crumpled receipt. On his compact body, denim pants and a dark shirt. "It looks like he did a money exchange on October 4th," Stern said to the assistant, Gilberto Ramos, as she examined the receipt. "For $140." She scanned the man's clothing. "The shoes are pretty generic; we won't be able to use them. What brand were his jeans?" "Levi," Ramos said. "Size?" "35x30." "A lot of his belongings come from the U.S., so chances are this might not have been his first time trying to cross," Stern said, and then they were interrupted by the sound of a ringing telephone. Ramos looked toward the landline, but it was silent. "Is that my cell?" Stern asked him. It wasn't. "Is it yours?" she asked. Ramos shook his head. Advertisement They both looked toward the sound and the counter that held the backpack, where the dead man's phone was ringing. --- Laredo. This was a sprawling city of a quarter-million people, with an old downtown and new shopping plazas, old casitas and new McMansions - a city whose western boundary was formed by the Mexican border, which was currently protected by turnstiles on a chaotic highway, and which Donald Trump had insisted should instead be protected by a wall. Laredo was where Stern had arrived a decade before to become the county's medical examiner, and where her offices were located at the end of a dusty, unmarked road. Once a month, she gathered her staff for a meeting to discuss the issue that took up more than a third of their time: identifying the people who died trying to cross the border into the United States and sending their remains home. It was her belief that burial was the way to honor that a person had existed. "That he had walked on this Earth," she sometimes said. Burial was the acknowledgment of universal human dignity, she believed, and the physical location of a family's grief. "Okay, let's start," she said at October's meeting, a few days before her Sunday morning autopsy. Stern crossed one cowboy-booted foot over the other and turned to the first page in a packet labeled "Decedent List As Of October 7, 2016." It was divided into categories: whether the decedents were now in the morgue in her office or at the forensic anthropologist's office; whether the remains had been intact or skeletal. It was six pages, single-spaced. It was too long and, despite Stern having devised strategies that gave her an identification success rate of about 75 percent, it never seemed to get any shorter. Immigration had become a flash point of the presidential election, a flurry of numbers with consequences often in dispute. In fiscal 2015, by the Department of Homeland Security's count, about 331,000 people had been apprehended as they tried to cross the U.S.-Mexico border, a drop-off from the year before. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, Border Patrol agents had apprehended nearly 409,000. Many were released to await hearings for asylum, which can take months or years. Stern, 50, didn't consider herself to be a political person, and her job was not to think about the thousands of people who crossed every year in search of new beginnings. Her job was to think about the people who didn't make it, who drowned in rivers or dropped to the ground from dehydration or from the temperatures that soared past 110 degrees.  Her job was to think about endings. --- Last year, the total number of border crossers who died and arrived in her office had been 105 - more than any other jurisdiction from Texas to the Pacific Ocean. This year, her office had reached that number by the first day in October. The tally for the calendar year was written on the whiteboard in her autopsy room: "Crossers: 105," in red marker. Stern knew it was only a matter of time before she received the call telling her that someone had found border crosser 106. "Last year was busy, this year was worse," she'd been telling people throughout the week. She hadn't taken a vacation in half a decade; a couple of years ago, she'd finally petitioned the county commissioners to let her cash out 169 hours of leave time she knew she'd never use. Just this week, she had tried to take a day of rest for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. She'd celebrated by phoning her grown son, who had recently moved to Israel, but ended up back at her desk before the day was through. "What's the status here?" she asked at the staff meeting, pulling her red hair into a ponytail and pointing to a few case numbers on the list of decedents. A staff member explained that the remains, sent for DNA testing to a forensic anthropologist at the University of North Texas, had been identified but not yet sent back to the crossers' home countries. "He's ID'd, so he doesn't need to be sitting around on an anthropologist's table," Stern said. "He needs to be buried." "But once they're at that office - " a member of her staff began. "They need to be buried," Stern interrupted. "Well," the staffer started. "Even if they're getting an indigent burial. I don't want them sitting on a shelf somewhere. They need to be buried," she said. --- The most recent crosser, 105, had been found in Maverick County, no ID, no fingerprint match, and his DNA had been sent for testing. The 104th crosser was identified quickly: a 41-year-old from Mexico whose family was working with the consulate to bring home his remains. The 103 crossers who had come before them had their own sad endings or non-endings. There was a man whose entire family lived in North Carolina, who had been trying to travel to join them, and instead of a welcome party they ended up having a funeral with an urn of ashes. There was another man who was found with nothing but a roll of U.S. bills, all $100s, and a love letter in English that was too decomposed to read much of except for the last line, "I can't wait for you to hold me again." Stern had learned to gently slice open the denim pockets of border crossers' jeans, easing out waterlogged scraps of paper without tearing them: Sometimes people were identified based on scrawled phone numbers. She had learned to X-ray every patient who came in, searching for steel plates or oddly set bones, or other anomalies that could be compared to X-rays of missing people. She had seen crossers come in with not a single identifying characteristic, and when she looked at them, she thought, "What is the population of the entire world?" because those were the odds she was dealing with: The person on her table was one of 7 billion people, and by the grace of fate that person was now lying before her and not a single one of their loved ones knew it yet. She had far too many opportunities to reflect on this, because over the past several years, Stern had taken over the work for nine surrounding counties, a total area of 17,000 square miles. Earlier in the week, an officer from the Honduran Consulate had brought a pile of manila folders - her own never-ending list - to Stern's office to see whether any outstanding missing-persons cases matched people the doctor had recently identified. The consul, Lilian Gomez, held up a picture of a young, dark-haired woman. "Her brother is calling us every week to ask if you have the DNA results." The brother had seen a picture of a body on a Facebook page that aimed to identify missing migrants and become convinced the dead woman was his sister. "It's not her," Stern said, comparing the two pictures. She sighed and shook her head. "This person is much older. The nose is different. The ears are different. One has curly hair and one has straight." Stern knew the two photos didn't match, and she also knew that grief did funny things to people's minds. They moved on to another case, and another. After two hours, Gomez picked up the last folder and stared at it for a moment. "This one - this one I don't know what to do with," she said. "We still have him here?" asked Stern. "Yes." Gomez explained: The case had dragged on for months. A crosser brought to Stern's office matched the description of a missing Honduran man. The dental records showed a match, but the family wanted more proof. Stern brought in a forensic dentist who told them the match was beyond question. The family still didn't believe their son could be dead, and so they were refusing to claim his remains. "I am a Christian, I do believe in spiritual things," Gomez said. "But the family called a lady in California." "A psychic?" Stern asked. "They called a psychic. She tells them, your son is still alive. He is working on a ranch with 20 other people." Stern shook her head. "But if that was the case, why wouldn't he call them?" "Yes, exactly," Gomez said. Stern told Gomez that she wanted to be able to send him home. But she understood that hope also did funny things to people. In the face of relentless sadness, a family might choose to believe something that went against the facts of the situation. They talked about giving the family more time. "I can give them closure," she said to Gomez, finally. "But I take away their hope." --- The office had been filled with a sense of relief at the beginning of the week; during slow periods, the staff could finally catch up on paperwork. That turned into anxious anticipation toward the end, and one of the assistants had taken to whispering, "They found a crosser?" every time the phone rang. Late Friday, a county worker dropped by just before closing and asked whether the week had been hectic. "Just so you know, our number this year is 105 and our numbers, total, last year were 105," Stern answered. "And last year between October 1st and December, there were 25 crossers. This year it's been really hot. We're going to get to 106." Stern got in her white truck and drove home to the ranch where she lived alone - a red barn house with stables where she kept goats and horses. She checked in on her pregnant mare, and she fed her dogs, and she stopped to pet her favorite goat, which had recently given birth at the advanced age of 13. Texas was her home, and living on a ranch, with nothing to interfere with the dark, starry skies, felt right to her. She'd grown up in the state, the daughter of a World War II hero, and while she'd tried living other places after medical school, she knew she wanted to come back to Texas and she knew she wanted to be a medical examiner. It was her father's idea. He'd become a psychiatrist, spending 25 years working at veterans hospitals and easing serviceman after serviceman through the horrors of post-traumatic stress disorder. She'd wanted to do what he did, but when she told him that as a young girl, he said, in his frank way, "I don't think you'd be a good psychiatrist. I think you would be a good forensic pathologist." She didn't ask him why, but she sensed that maybe he wanted to spare her the pain that could sometimes accompany working with the living. --- The nanny goat's kid was stillborn. Stern had helped ease it out of its mother's womb already knowing it was too late. And then the mother had lain there, unmoving, and Stern thought she would lose her, too. But hours later, she looked down and saw another pair of tiny hoofs emerging from the birth canal. Twins. Stern replayed that moment over and over, believing that surrounding herself by life was the only way to balance the fact that she was so often surrounded by death. She finished up her evening chores and headed to a nearby ranch, where a family she knew had invited people over to watch a goat-roping competition. "Daddy, it's the doctor!" a small girl called to her father as soon as Stern arrived. Everyone recognized the doctor. People in the city had gotten used to seeing her on television whenever there was a high-profile case, like a sensational murder, and they knew that if you were missing somebody you loved, then her office would try to help you find them. And there weren't many Jewish women in Laredo - Stern was the only person she knew who kept kosher. "Mirabeli! I brought some treats for you," Stern said as the little girl climbed into her lap, and she handed her a paper bag filled with Chex Mix and Tostitos. "C'mon, you can get him!" Stern yelled, making sure to cheer on the youngest, smallest boys in their sturdy jeans, trying their slender lassoes on the agitated goats. Just as she was beginning to relax for the weekend, her cellphone vibrated in her pocket. "Hey, Jesse, what have you got?" she asked. She listened while a colleague from Brooks County described a situation and then immediately dialed Francisco Gonzalez, her office's investigator on duty that weekend. "Jesse's bringing in a crosser from Brooks County," she told Gonzalez over the phone. She told him to go straight to the office to meet the car carrying the crosser and said she would be in first thing Sunday morning to perform an autopsy. A man had been found in jeans and a backpack on a ranch behind a Wal-Mart, and crosser 106 had arrived. --- Letizia Sebastian and Enoc David Vásquez Valverde were both barely 20 when they met. He'd come to Oaxaca from a small, poor town on the western Mexican coast and gotten a job at the animal feed store where Letizia was working, and she thought he seemed humble and had kind eyes. They married at the courthouse, they moved into her family's crowded house because they couldn't afford their own place, and they had a baby girl, whom they named Zoe and dressed in pink. The baby changed things. Enoc, now 21, wanted more for his daughter and more for their family. The couple wanted to move into their own apartment, but there was never enough work, paying never enough money. As 2016 passed, he started telling Letizia that he had friends in the United States who could help him find a job there. Finally, one day in late September she went with him to the bus station where he told her not to worry, that he was going to find them a better way of life. The bus took him to Monterrey, a city in northern Mexico. He called her from there saying that he was staying in a hotel with some people he'd met; they would be there for four or five days until the coyote they had hired to guide them through the border said the conditions were right. A few days later they were, and at 6 p.m. on Oct. 6, Enoc sent a text telling her that tonight was the night they would cross. Because they didn't want to be detected, nobody in the group would be making any phone calls while they navigated the desert to the United States, he told her. The next time Letizia would hear from him, he said, would be when he'd reached the other side. --- Less than 24 hours after Stern had received the call about crosser 106, she received two more. Crosser 107: skeletal remains, also found in Brooks County, possibly requiring DNA analysis to be identified. Crosser 108: a man found floating facedown in the Rio Grande. Less than 24 hours, and there were three more people added to her list, and three more families lacking endings. The final one, 108, was in Webb County, Stern's county, meaning that not only would she be responsible for his autopsy but she would also be responsible for retrieving his remains. On Saturday evening, she put on her scrubs and her tallest waterproof boots and drove past a mobile home park and a cluster of palm trees to an access point on the Rio Grande, where Mexico looked so close. "Who usually picks up the body?" the Border Patrol agent asked when she got out of her truck and made her way down the steep riverbank. "If it's in the water, I'll get in and do it myself," she said. "We can't assist," he warned her. "I know you can't. I'll do it." She got in the Border Patrol boat and told the investigator who had accompanied her to wait on the banks and to ready a body bag. The man was bloated. He had begun to decompose. Stern and Gonzalez, her investigator, maneuvered the man into the body bag that had been donated in a grant by the governor's office because the problem of dead border crossers had reached a state of urgency. Stern and Francisco each took two of the handles on the bag. They started carrying it up the steep riverbank. Their feet slipped. Their boots filled with mud. They started up again. They made sure not to let the bag touch the ground. They passed the bag containing the man who died in the river between the layers of barbed wire fence that protected the riverbank. They put him in their van. "I'll see you tomorrow," Stern said to Gonzalez, and tomorrow came, and Stern was again at her table. --- Now it was a little after 9 o'clock on a Sunday morning. Crosser 106, the man who had been found behind the Wal-Mart, was lying on her table. He was young, she could tell that. His face was round. His eyes were closed, and he looked as if he could have been asleep. His phone was ringing. Stern looked at it. She hesitated. "The problem is that neither of us speaks Spanish well enough to talk with the family," she said to Ramos, her assistant. The phone stopped, and Stern went back to work, but a few minutes later it rang again. She paused for just a moment before walking quickly over to the phone. "Hello?" she said. "¿Hola? ¿Habla inglés?" On the other end, she heard a flurry of words in Spanish. "Do you have anyone there who habla inglés?" she asked. "Hello?" She gave up and pressed the end-call button, but the phone immediately rang again. "Hello?" she said. "No hablo español bueno. Can you call back in 20 minutes? ¿Veinte minutos?" She hung up again. "I think that was his wife," she told Ramos quietly. She didn't know whether the woman had understood her, but Gonzales, who was fluent in Spanish, was scheduled to start his shift in 20 minutes. The phone rang again. She didn't pick up. Five minutes later it rang again. Two minutes after that it rang again. "She keeps calling back," Stern said. "She keeps trying." Now the phone was ringing unceasingly as Stern photographed crosser 106 - his face, his body, any identifying details - and prepared him for an autopsy. She already suspected the cause of death to be dehydration. The phone rang, Gonzalez arrived and Stern handed it to him. "Tell them you are with Dr. Stern in the medical examiner's office," she told him, coaching him quietly on the right thing to say. "Tell them we found this phone on the body of a person who was recovered on a ranch in Brooks County, and ask if they are missing a family member." Several hundred miles away, the dead man's parents sat in their home in Santo Domingo de Morelos, having just heard from their daughter-in-law that an English-speaking stranger had picked up their son's phone. Gonzalez translated Stern's message to them. He cupped his hand over the mouthpiece to relay the answer. "The man says he is missing his son." Stern nodded. "Ask him when is the last time he saw his son." Gonzalez asked. "He says a few days ago." In the middle of the room, crosser 106 lay on the metal table. His clothing had been removed. He had been turned on his side. "Ask him if he can describe any tattoos his son has," she told Gonzalez. "A scorpion," Gonzalez responded. On the man's back, a scorpion curved around his shoulder blade, with a name that looked as if it could belong to a wife or girlfriend. "With the name 'Zoe,' " Gonzalez continued, listening to the father describe the tattoo on the other end. "Zoe is his little daughter." Stern had asked the questions in careful order, not wanting to alarm someone unnecessarily. But now there was really only one more question to ask. She searched for the Mexican identification card that had been found with crosser 106. "Ask him what is his son's name," she said finally. "¿Como se llama su hijo?" Gonzalez asked. He turned to Stern and spoke slowly and clearly. "His son's name is Enoc David Vásquez Valverde." She looked down at the card. "Tell them that unfortunately, we have his son here," she said. Gonzalez did. The father accepted the news quietly, but he could hear the mother sobbing in the background. Their son had been found, in the brushland, less than 24 hours after he had texted his wife that he was making the crossing. "Tell him the Mexican Consulate will call him," Stern said, explaining that it was the consulate who would help figure out how to send their son's remains back to them. Gonzalez hung up the phone. Stern finished her work, removed her gloves, began filling in papers. "Enoc David Vásquez Valverde," she said, repeating the name Gonzalez had just given her, the one belonging to the man who had once been border crosser 106. She had an ending. It was a sad one, but it was an ending and it was the best she could do. --- Manuel Roig-Franzia in Washington contributed to this report. border ————— Keywords: donald trump immigration policy, illegal immigrants, build that wall, Texas illegal immigration, border with mexico, rio grande, illegal immigration, path to citizenship, dr. corinne stern, corinne stern, medical examiner, border crossers Print   Email   Font ResizeReturn to Top   RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Crisanta Duran, a legacy that aims to all four Colorado corners Aplicación móvil Cyclus Break para alumnos latinos en Denver Denver: Inmigrantes demandan a empresa que les pagaba un dólar al día   Judge allows suit by ex-TV anchor fired after online remarks PITTSBURGH (AP) — A federal judge has declined to throw out a lawsuit filed by a former Pittsburgh newscaster fired after her comments in a Facebook post about a shooting were deemed racially insensitive. Full Story 'Fantastic Beasts' spins magic, 'Billy Lynn's' tanks Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars, Sting set for American Music Awards Trump again slams 'Hamilton'; Pence says he wasn't offended (Lisa Rathke/AP) No bones about it, group wants to preserve doggie haven ST.

Here, Webb County Sheriff’s Deputy Mauro Lopez reaches for a human skull found alongside a ranch road in the South Texas city of Laredo. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) LAREDO, Tex. — The man had been found two nights before on the brushland of a South Texas ranch, miles from the nearest sign of civilization, which was the back of a Walmart. The Border Patrol agent who spotted him didn’t know how long the young man had been walking before he collapsed and died, and neither did Corinne Stern, the Webb County medical examiner on whose autopsy table he now lay. He’d been carrying a backpack. The backpack would be how Stern began to piece together who the man was and how she could send him back to his family, and so, early on a Sunday morning, her assistant lined up its contents, item by item. A bottle of water, mostly empty. A cellphone, protected by a passcode. A wallet, which meant nothing: Sometimes the people who entered the country by swimming and hiking across its border did so while carrying other people’s identification. A bag of corn chips, a can of tuna fish, a crumpled receipt. On his compact body, denim pants and a dark shirt. “It looks like he did a money exchange on October 4th,” Stern said to the assistant, Gilberto Ramos, as she examined the receipt. “For $140.” She scanned the man’s clothing. “The shoes are pretty generic; we won’t be able to use them. What brand were his jeans?” “Levi,” Ramos said. “Size?” “35x30.” “A lot of his belongings come from the U.S., so chances are this might not have been his first time trying to cross,” Stern said, and then they were interrupted by the sound of a ringing telephone. Ramos looked toward the landline, but it was silent. “Is that my cell?” Stern asked him. It wasn’t. “Is it yours?” she asked. Ramos shook his head. They both looked toward the sound and the counter that held the backpack, where the dead man’s phone was ringing. *** AN ENDING AND A BEGINNING: A sheriff’s deputy stands over a body found by a ranch hand as he inspected fencing in Laredo. The remains next go to the Webb County medical examiner’s office, where fingerprints, DNA testing and other techniques are used to identify the border crosser. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) Laredo. This was a sprawling city of a quarter-million people, with an old downtown and new shopping plazas, old casitas and new McMansions — a city whose western boundary was formed by the Mexican border, which was currently protected by turnstiles on a chaotic highway, and which Donald Trump had insisted should instead be protected by a wall. Laredo was where Stern had arrived a decade before to become the county’s medical examiner, and where her offices were located at the end of a dusty, unmarked road. Once a month, she gathered her staff for a meeting to discuss the issue that took up more than a third of their time: identifying the people who died trying to cross the border into the United States and sending their remains home. It was her belief that burial was the way to honor that a person had existed. “That he had walked on this Earth,” she sometimes said. Burial was the acknowledgment of universal human dignity, she believed, and the physical location of a family’s grief. “Okay, let’s start,” she said at October’s meeting, a few days before her Sunday morning autopsy. Stern crossed one cowboy-booted foot over the other and turned to the first page in a packet labeled “Decedent List As Of October 7, 2016.” It was divided into categories: whether the decedents were now in the morgue in her office or at the forensic anthropologist’s office; whether the remains had been intact or skeletal. It was six pages, single-spaced. It was too long and, despite Stern having devised strategies that gave her an identification success rate of about 75 percent, it never seemed to get any shorter. Immigration had become a flash point of the presidential election, a flurry of numbers with consequences often in dispute. In fiscal 2015, by the Department of Homeland Security’s count, about 331,000 people had been apprehended as they tried to cross the U.S.-Mexico border, a drop-off from the year before. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, Border Patrol agents had apprehended nearly 409,000. Many were released to await hearings for asylum, which can take months or years. Stern, 50, didn’t consider herself to be a political person, and her job was not to think about the thousands of people who crossed every year in search of new beginnings. Her job was to think about the people who didn’t make it, who drowned in rivers or dropped to the ground from dehydration or from the temperatures that soared past 110 degrees. Her job was to think about endings. A VOICE FOR THE DEAD: Corinne Stern, Webb County’s chief medical examiner, thinks of the people who cross her autopsy table as silent patients who need her help to reach a final destination. Here, she and autopsy technician Mateo Arredondo examine the skeletal remains of a border crosser. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) Last year, the total number of border crossers who died and arrived in her office had been 105 — more than any other jurisdiction from Texas to the Pacific Ocean. This year, her office had reached that number by the first day in October. The tally for the calendar year was written on the whiteboard in her autopsy room: “Crossers: 105,” in red marker. Stern knew it was only a matter of time before she received the call telling her that someone had found border crosser 106. “Last year was busy, this year was worse,” she’d been telling people throughout the week. She hadn’t taken a vacation in half a decade; a couple of years ago, she’d finally petitioned the county commissioners to let her cash out 169 hours of leave time she knew she’d never use. Just this week, she had tried to take a day of rest for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. She’d celebrated by phoning her grown son, who had recently moved to Israel, but ended up back at her desk before the day was through. “What’s the status here?” she asked at the staff meeting, pulling her red hair into a ponytail and pointing to a few case numbers on the list of decedents. A staff member explained that the remains, sent for DNA testing to a forensic anthropologist at the University of North Texas, had been identified but not yet sent back to the crossers’ home countries. “He’s ID’d, so he doesn’t need to be sitting around on an anthropologist’s table,” Stern said. “He needs to be buried.” “But once they’re at that office — ” a member of her staff began. “They need to be buried,” Stern interrupted. “Well,” the staffer started. “Even if they’re getting an indigent burial. I don’t want them sitting on a shelf somewhere. They need to be buried,” she said. *** CLUES TO A LIFE: Border crossers are sometimes found with wallets and passports, other times with only phone numbers on scraps of paper, or nothing at all. An autopsy technician tries to decipher a love letter, written in English, found in one man’s pocket. Only the last line was legible: “I can’t wait for you to hold me again.” (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) The most recent crosser, 105, had been found in Maverick County, no ID, no fingerprint match, and his DNA had been sent for testing. The 104th crosser was identified quickly: a 41-year-old from Mexico whose family was working with the consulate to bring home his remains. The 103 crossers who had come before them had their own sad endings or non-endings. There was a man whose entire family lived in North Carolina, who had been trying to travel to join them, and instead of a welcome party they ended up having a funeral with an urn of ashes. There was another man who was found with nothing but a roll of U.S. bills, all $100s, and a love letter in English that was too decomposed to read much of except for the last line, “I can’t wait for you to hold me again.” Stern had learned to gently slice open the denim pockets of border crossers’ jeans, easing out waterlogged scraps of paper without tearing them: Sometimes people were identified based on scrawled phone numbers. She had learned to X-ray every patient who came in, searching for steel plates or oddly set bones, or other anomalies that could be compared to X-rays of missing people. She had seen crossers come in with not a single identifying characteristic, and when she looked at them, she thought, “What is the population of the entire world?” because those were the odds she was dealing with: The person on her table was one of 7 billion people, and by the grace of fate that person was now lying before her and not a single one of their loved ones knew it yet. She had far too many opportunities to reflect on this, because over the past several years, Stern had taken over the work for nine surrounding counties, a total area of 17,000 square miles. Earlier in the week, an officer from the Honduran Consulate had brought a pile of manila folders — her own never-ending list — to Stern’s office to see whether any outstanding missing-persons cases matched people the doctor had recently identified. The consul, Lilian Gomez, held up a picture of a young, dark-haired woman. “Her brother is calling us every week to ask if you have the DNA results.” The brother had seen a picture of a body on a Facebook page that aimed to identify missing migrants and become convinced the dead woman was his sister. “It’s not her,” Stern said, comparing the two pictures. She sighed and shook her head. “This person is much older. The nose is different. The ears are different. One has curly hair and one has straight.” Stern knew the two photos didn’t match, and she also knew that grief did funny things to people’s minds. They moved on to another case, and another. After two hours, Gomez picked up the last folder and stared at it for a moment. “This one — this one I don’t know what to do with,” she said. “We still have him here?” asked Stern. “Yes.” Gomez explained: The case had dragged on for months. A crosser brought to Stern’s office matched the description of a missing Honduran man. The dental records showed a match, but the family wanted more proof. Stern brought in a forensic dentist who told them the match was beyond question. The family still didn’t believe their son could be dead, and so they were refusing to claim his remains. “I am a Christian, I do believe in spiritual things,” Gomez said. “But the family called a lady in California.” “A psychic?” Stern asked. “They called a psychic. She tells them, your son is still alive. He is working on a ranch with 20 other people.” Stern shook her head. “But if that was the case, why wouldn’t he call them?” “Yes, exactly,” Gomez said. Stern told Gomez that she wanted to be able to send him home. But she understood that hope also did funny things to people. In the face of relentless sadness, a family might choose to believe something that went against the facts of the situation. They talked about giving the family more time. “I can give them closure,” she said to Gomez, finally. “But I take away their hope.” *** The office had been filled with a sense of relief at the beginning of the week; during slow periods, the staff could finally catch up on paperwork. That turned into anxious anticipation toward the end, and one of the assistants had taken to whispering, “They found a crosser?” every time the phone rang. Late Friday, a county worker dropped by just before closing and asked whether the week had been hectic. “Just so you know, our number this year is 105 and our numbers, total, last year were 105,” Stern answered. “And last year between October 1st and December, there were 25 crossers. This year it’s been really hot. We’re going to get to 106.” Stern got in her white truck and drove home to the ranch where she lived alone — a red barn house with stables where she kept goats and horses. She checked in on her pregnant mare, and she fed her dogs, and she stopped to pet her favorite goat, which had recently given birth at the advanced age of 13. Texas was her home, and living on a ranch, with nothing to interfere with the dark, starry skies, felt right to her. She’d grown up in the state, the daughter of a World War II hero, and while she’d tried living other places after medical school, she knew she wanted to come back to Texas and she knew she wanted to be a medical examiner. It was her father’s idea. He’d become a psychiatrist, spending 25 years working at veterans hospitals and easing serviceman after serviceman through the horrors of post-traumatic stress disorder. She’d wanted to do what he did, but when she told him that as a young girl, he said, in his frank way, “I don’t think you’d be a good psychiatrist. I think you would be a good forensic pathologist.” She didn’t ask him why, but she sensed that maybe he wanted to spare her the pain that could sometimes accompany working with the living. MISSION WORK: Corinne Stern, who has been Webb County’s chief medical examiner for about a decade, views her work as a calling. “Once you lose compassion, you don’t need to be in this field,” she says. “It has to be something that’s a part of you.” (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) The nanny goat’s kid was stillborn. Stern had helped ease it out of its mother’s womb already knowing it was too late. And then the mother had lain there, unmoving, and Stern thought she would lose her, too. But hours later, she looked down and saw another pair of tiny hoofs emerging from the birth canal. Twins. Stern replayed that moment over and over, believing that surrounding herself by life was the only way to balance the fact that she was so often surrounded by death. She finished up her evening chores and headed to a nearby ranch, where a family she knew had invited people over to watch a goat-roping competition. “Daddy, it’s the doctor!” a small girl called to her father as soon as Stern arrived. Everyone recognized the doctor. People in the city had gotten used to seeing her on television whenever there was a high-profile case, like a sensational murder, and they knew that if you were missing somebody you loved, then her office would try to help you find them. And there weren’t many Jewish women in Laredo — Stern was the only person she knew who kept kosher. “Mirabeli! I brought some treats for you,” Stern said as the little girl climbed into her lap, and she handed her a paper bag filled with Chex Mix and Tostitos. “C’mon, you can get him!” Stern yelled, making sure to cheer on the youngest, smallest boys in their sturdy jeans, trying their slender lassoes on the agitated goats. Just as she was beginning to relax for the weekend, her cellphone vibrated in her pocket. “Hey, Jesse, what have you got?” she asked. She listened while a colleague from Brooks County described a situation and then immediately dialed Francisco Gonzalez, her office’s investigator on duty that weekend. “Jesse’s bringing in a crosser from Brooks County,” she told Gonzalez over the phone. She told him to go straight to the office to meet the car carrying the crosser and said she would be in first thing Sunday morning to perform an autopsy. A man had been found in jeans and a backpack on a ranch behind a Walmart, and crosser 106 had arrived. *** A SAD HOMECOMING: After the remains of border crossers are identified, they can be sent home. Here, a family in North Carolina holds a prayer service for their loved one, who had been deported to Mexico and was trying to rejoin them in the United States. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) Letizia Sebastian and Enoc David Vásquez Valverde were both barely 20 when they met. He’d come to Oaxaca from a small, poor town on the western Mexican coast and gotten a job at the animal feed store where Letizia was working, and she thought he seemed humble and had kind eyes. They married at the courthouse, they moved into her family’s crowded house because they couldn’t afford their own place, and they had a baby girl, whom they named Zoe and dressed in pink. The baby changed things. Enoc, now 21, wanted more for his daughter and more for their family. The couple wanted to move into their own apartment, but there was never enough work, paying never enough money. As 2016 passed, he started telling Letizia that he had friends in the United States who could help him find a job there. Finally, one day in late September she went with him to the bus station where he told her not to worry, that he was going to find them a better way of life. The bus took him to Monterrey, a city in northern Mexico. He called her from there saying that he was staying in a hotel with some people he’d met; they would be there for four or five days until the coyote they had hired to guide them through the border said the conditions were right. A few days later they were, and at 6 p.m. on Oct. 6, Enoc sent a text telling her that tonight was the night they would cross. Because they didn’t want to be detected, nobody in the group would be making any phone calls while they navigated the desert to the United States, he told her. The next time Letizia would hear from him, he said, would be when he’d reached the other side. *** THE UNENDING JOURNEY: They come by raft and by foot, families and individuals from Central American countries crossing the Rio Grande into Texas. After a drop-off in 2015, the number of migrants apprehended crossing the U.S. border rose to more than 400,000 in the year ended Sept. 30. Many of those detained are asking for some type of asylum and are released from detention after a few days. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) Less than 24 hours after Stern had received the call about crosser 106, she received two more. Crosser 107: skeletal remains, also found in Brooks County, possibly requiring DNA analysis to be identified. Crosser 108: a man found floating facedown in the Rio Grande. Less than 24 hours, and there were three more people added to her list, and three more families lacking endings. The final one, 108, was in Webb County, Stern’s county, meaning that not only would she be responsible for his autopsy but she would also be responsible for retrieving his remains. On Saturday evening, she put on her scrubs and her tallest waterproof boots and drove past a mobile home park and a cluster of palm trees to an access point on the Rio Grande, where Mexico looked so close. “Who usually picks up the body?” the Border Patrol agent asked when she got out of her truck and made her way down the steep riverbank. “If it’s in the water, I’ll get in and do it myself,” she said. “We can’t assist,” he warned her. “I know you can’t. I’ll do it.” She got in the Border Patrol boat and told the investigator who had accompanied her to wait on the banks and to ready a body bag. The man was bloated. He had begun to decompose. Stern and Gonzalez, her investigator, maneuvered the man into the body bag that had been donated in a grant by the governor’s office because the problem of dead border crossers had reached a state of urgency. Stern and Francisco each took two of the handles on the bag. They started carrying it up the steep riverbank. Their feet slipped. Their boots filled with mud. They started up again. They made sure not to let the bag touch the ground. They passed the bag containing the man who died in the river between the layers of barbed wire fence that protected the riverbank. They put him in their van. “I’ll see you tomorrow,” Stern said to Gonzalez, and tomorrow came, and Stern was again at her table. A PAUPER’S BURIAL: The Webb County medical examiner’s office has an identification success rate of about 75 percent, but when the deceased cannot be identified, they are eventually buried in the pauper section of Laredo’s City Cemetery. Here, a burial site’s marker reads “John Doe.” (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) Now it was a little after 9 o’clock on a Sunday morning. Crosser 106, the man who had been found behind the Walmart, was lying on her table. He was young, she could tell that. His face was round. His eyes were closed, and he looked as if he could have been asleep. His phone was ringing. Stern looked at it. She hesitated. “The problem is that neither of us speaks Spanish well enough to talk with the family,” she said to Ramos, her assistant. The phone stopped, and Stern went back to work, but a few minutes later it rang again. She paused for just a moment before walking quickly over to the phone. “Hello?” she said. “¿ Hola? ¿Habla inglés?” On the other end, she heard a flurry of words in Spanish. “Do you have anyone there who habla inglés?” she asked. “Hello?” She gave up and pressed the end-call button, but the phone immediately rang again. “Hello?” she said. “No hablo español bueno. Can you call back in 20 minutes? ¿ Veinte minutos?” She hung up again. “I think that was his wife,” she told Ramos quietly. She didn’t know whether the woman had understood her, but Gonzales, who was fluent in Spanish, was scheduled to start his shift in 20 minutes. The phone rang again. She didn’t pick up. Five minutes later it rang again. Two minutes after that it rang again. “She keeps calling back,” Stern said. “She keeps trying.” Now the phone was ringing unceasingly as Stern photographed crosser 106 — his face, his body, any identifying details — and prepared him for an autopsy. She already suspected the cause of death to be dehydration. The phone rang, Gonzalez arrived and Stern handed it to him. “Tell them you are with Dr. Stern in the medical examiner’s office,” she told him, coaching him quietly on the right thing to say. “Tell them we found this phone on the body of a person who was recovered on a ranch in Brooks County, and ask if they are missing a family member.” Several hundred miles away, the dead man’s parents sat in their home in Santo Domingo de Morelos, having just heard from their daughter-in-law that an English-speaking stranger had picked up their son’s phone. Gonzalez translated Stern’s message to them. He cupped his hand over the mouthpiece to relay the answer. “The man says he is missing his son.” Stern nodded. “Ask him when is the last time he saw his son.” Gonzalez asked. “He says a few days ago.” In the middle of the room, crosser 106 lay on the metal table. His clothing had been removed. He had been turned on his side. “Ask him if he can describe any tattoos his son has,” she told Gonzalez. “A scorpion,” Gonzalez responded. On the man’s back, a scorpion curved around his shoulder blade, with a name that looked as if it could belong to a wife or girlfriend. “With the name ‘Zoe,’ ” Gonzalez continued, listening to the father describe the tattoo on the other end. “Zoe is his little daughter.” Stern had asked the questions in careful order, not wanting to alarm someone unnecessarily. But now there was really only one more question to ask. She searched for the Mexican identification card that had been found with crosser 106. “Ask him what is his son’s name,” she said finally. “¿ Como se llama su hijo?” Gonzalez asked. He turned to Stern and spoke slowly and clearly. “His son’s name is Enoc David Vásquez Valverde.” She looked down at the card. “Tell them that unfortunately, we have his son here,” she said. Gonzalez did. The father accepted the news quietly, but he could hear the mother sobbing in the background. Their son had been found, in the brushland, less than 24 hours after he had texted his wife that he was making the crossing. “Tell him the Mexican Consulate will call him,” Stern said, explaining that it was the consulate who would help figure out how to send their son’s remains back to them. Gonzalez hung up the phone. Stern finished her work, removed her gloves, began filling in papers. “Enoc David Vásquez Valverde,” she said, repeating the name Gonzalez had just given her, the one belonging to the man who had once been border crosser 106. She had an ending. It was a sad one, but it was an ending and it was the best she could do. REJUVENATION OF LIFE: Corinne Stern combats the weariness of her job by spending time with the animals she raises on her ranch. “I surround myself with life all the time,” she says. “It’s the only way.” (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) Manuel Roig-Franzia in Washington contributed to this report. classic-apps Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Bradford is part of a seniors' group called the Meadlowlarks, all residents of the Ranch Park seniors' mobile home park in Ellison. She said the park's social club, the Meadowlarks, support the Salvation Army's Christmas campaign to bring a little cheer to families in need this holiday season. "I believe in what the Salvation Army does for people. That's why I'm here and why our social club supports doing this," said Bradford, doing her first 2-hour shift at the Kettle Pot set up at the entrance to the Kelowna Wal-Mart store. Bradford said the Meadowlarks will fill in eight days of shifts at Kettle locations. "We are all getting a little older so we can't all do as much as could in the past but we do what we can," said Bradford as she acknowledged her first donation of the day for $5 from a Wal-Mart shopper entering the store. Pastor Darryl Burry said its the enthusiasm of Bradford and the many others who man about 5,000 volunteer hours at the 20 Christmas Kettle locations across the Central Okanagan that allow for fundraising target of $750,000 to be achievable. Last year, the campaign raised $752,000. "The Central Okanagan is one of the highest fundraising target areas in all of Canada," said Burry. "If you look at Calgary, their target is set at $1 million, and we are at $750,000, so it is significant how much support our area provides to our campaign." Burry added that the Central Okanagan is one of the most generous communities he has been involved with for donating to needy families at Christmas, this being his third Christmas Kettle campaign here. "We set a high target here because of the need and because of the tremendous support we receive." Along with the Kettle donations, the Salvation Army assisted close to 600 local families through the Christmas  Food & Toy Program, and was able to provide something under the tree for 1,100 children through the toy program. All the donations collected at Christmas are able to extend well into the new year to help families in need on various levels—but the growing need is cutting into how far those food and cash donations can be extended. "Typically, our food donations used to carry us well into June of the next year, but this past year it got us to April," said Burry, reflecting on Kelowna's perception of a wealthy community doesn't always fit with the economic downturn realities of an increasing number of families. "We are always open to more volunteers helping out during the Christmas campaign because the need is great," he said. The Kettle bell ringers will be manning two-hour shifts from now until Christmas Eve. To volunteer you time to help out, email kettles@kelsa.ca or call 250-860-2329.

That was nothing, experts say. Remember flakka, the drug that made some users tear off their clothes and run naked through the streets? That was nothing, experts say. Mike ClaryContact ReporterSun Sentinel Death toll from South Florida's opioid drug crisis continues to rise, could hit 800 by end of the year Privacy Policy The man in his late 30s, dressed in shorts, an open shirt and barefoot, lay face down on the pavement outside the front door of Wal-Mart. He had been dumped out of a car and was not moving. His skin was a blue-gray. He looked dead. With all five available units from Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue Station 2 on other calls, including two for other suspected heroin overdoses, Rescue 47 from a station nearby was sent siren wailing to the store in the 2000 block of West Broward Boulevard. When paramedics climbed out of the truck at 1:32 p.m. on a Wednesday, bystander Sharon Jones stepped forward. "He's got track marks and blood on his arm," Jones told them. "I couldn't find a pulse." Similar scenes are happening every day across the nation. The U.S. is in the grip of an opioid epidemic, and the outbreak is raging in South Florida. Every two hours, someone in southern Florida suffers an overdose from heroin, a lethal synthetic heroin called fentanyl or a similar powerful painkiller, according to federal officials. Federal lawmakers hold discussion on heroin in Bradenton U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Vern Buchanan, both of whom are running for re-election, will gather at a roundtable discussion at Manatee Memorial Hospital to talk about the heroin and opioid epidemic. The Bradenton Herald reports (http://bit.ly/2etS5bv) the meeting will be held at noon on Monday.... U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Vern Buchanan, both of whom are running for re-election, will gather at a roundtable discussion at Manatee Memorial Hospital to talk about the heroin and opioid epidemic. The Bradenton Herald reports (http://bit.ly/2etS5bv) the meeting will be held at noon on Monday....Read the story It is projected that by the end of this year, the 12-month total of those who have died of drug overdoses involving heroin and other opiates will exceed 800 in Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties, according to data from South Florida medical examiners. Remember flakka, the drug that made some users tear off their clothes and run naked through the streets? That was nothing, experts and local cops say. "I have never seen it like this, ever," said Lt. Ozzy Tianga, a veteran Broward Sheriff's Office detective. "Nothing comes close. I have never seen as much heroin as I'm seeing now. It's tremendous." South Florida has often been the epicenter of runaway drug abuse. In the 1980s it was cocaine, and then crack cocaine. Last decade narcotics like oxycodone turned Broward County into the nation's "pill mill" capital. Flakka and other synthetics known as bath salts had a run over the last couple of years. Now South Florida, along with New England, New Jersey, Ohio and Southern Appalachia, is among the national hot spots for heroin, and the synthetic opioids fentanyl and the even more dangerous carfentanil, potent enough to knock down an elephant, according to Jim Hall, an epidemiologist at Nova Southeastern University who has studied South Florida's drug market for decades and tracks national drug use trends. "This is a wake up call for America," Hall said. "An epidemic is one more case than expected, and we're seeing thousands of cases." In recent weeks, South Florida officials have sounded an alarm about the drug crisis, repeating stark warnings from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration about the perils of fentanyl and carfentanil, both so potent they can be fatal if inhaled or come in contact with the skin of first responders such as paramedics. Animals are not immune. In October three dogs with the Broward Sheriff's Office K-9 unit working a search in a suspected Lauderhill drug house became ill with overdose-like symptoms. Chances are growing that heroin or cocaine bought on the streets of South Florida could be laced with carfentanil, the newest of the sythentic opioids used as a cheap and powerful additive. If it is present, "there's a very high chance you will die," said Craig Mallak, Broward's chief medical examiner. Overdose deaths pile up Last year, 159 people died from overdoses of heroin or synthetic heroin in Broward County. Of those about half involved fentanyl, often given to cancer patients for pain and up to 50 times more potent that heroin alone. This year deaths involving fentanyl are up by more than 200 percent over 2015, according to Mallak. In Palm Beach County, things are even worse, with the death toll from overdoses outpacing that in Broward by about 2 to 1. Of more than 300 overdose deaths recorded in 2015, fentanyl was a factor in 93, according to statistics from the Palm Beach Medical Examiner's office. This year the death toll from drug overdoses in Palm Beach County is projected to top 400, with the majority of cases involving opioids, said chief medical examiner Michael Bell. "We're getting inundated by these cases," he said. "What people think they're buying is heroin, but they are getting a combination" that often includes fentanyl. In Miami-Dade County, there have been 228 overdose deaths due to fentanyl and carfentanil so far this year, a three-fold increase from 2015. Of those, 107 have involved overdoses from carfentanil since July 1, according to the medical examiner's office. On the front lines of the epidemic are the firefighter-paramedics of Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue Station 2, in September named by Firehouse Magazine the busiest firehouse in the nation. Last year units from the station at 528 NW 2nd St. went out on more than 33,000 calls, an average of 90 a day. Increasingly, those calls are dispatched as "sick person," and that often means a drug overdose. Police are often not involved, and Florida law prohibits criminal charges from being filed for possession of a controlled substance if the drugs were found as a result of an overdose and need for medical assistance. Throughout Broward and Palm Beach counties, paramedics are running hard just to keep up, and spraying so much naloxone — a drug that blocks the effects of heroin and revives overdose patients — up the noses of comatose addicts that they are busting the budgets. "A routine call we get now is a guy not breathing and he's blue," said Station 2 firefighter Keith Costa. "It is not often that a 35-year-old goes into cardiac arrest. So you're thinking overdose." On those routine overdose calls, Costa and his colleagues find victims in bed, slumped over toilets, sprawled on the floor or passed out on the street. They hook the patient up to a cardiac monitor, maybe slap an oxygen mask on their faces, and after checking pulse and the dilation of their eyes, shoot 2 milligrams of Narcan — the brand name of naloxone — into their nostrils. Then the paramedics brace for projectile vomiting or an outbreak of wakeful combativeness. Paramedics also get used to seeing repeat customers. "It's disturbing," Costa said. "We actually ran a young male, got him to to the hospital, and 12 hours later he was found dead. It's tough to see that cycle." The man loaded into the ambulance in front of Wal-Mart was saved. It took three doses of Narcan, but by the time Rescue 47 arrived at Broward Health Medical Center he was sitting up on the stretcher. And unlike many overdose patients revived by paramedics, he did not blame them for spoiling his high. He had a smile on his face. "What did you do, heroin?" Battalion Chief Gregory May asked him. "Quarter bag," the man said. How are you feeling? May asked. "Good," he said. "Thanks for saving my life." As the man was wheeled into the emergency room, a paramedic arriving on another truck commented aloud: "He'll be back." 'We were all so hopeful' Paramedics don't always get there in time. They did not get there in time to save Allen Timm. In his late 40s, Timm was a longtime addict found unresponsive and with a syringe in his hand in the bathroom of a West Davie Boulevard halfway house earlier this year. Timm had been discharged from a rehabilitation facility just 18 hours before he died from what the ME's office said was an overdose of fentanyl. "That is the power of addiction," said Betty Peterson of Timm, her eldest child. "It is just so rough when it has a hold on you." Like so many relatives or friends of those caught up in the culture of drug abuse, Peterson never stopped trying to help her son, or hoping that this time he could stay clean. She recalled that when he got out of rehab in January, she took him to get new clothes and toiletries. She got his bicycle out of the pawn shop and recovered one of his guitars. "It was a new beginning, and he seemed so excited for a new life," said Peterson, of Miramar. "He was all set up with everything you would need to start again. But the drug people were after him, and he immediately started using." Heartbreak and loss In a crisis like this, the stories of heartbreak pile up, one atop another. Over the weekend of Aug. 12-13, six people in Broward County died of opioid overdoses, according to Mallak. One of those fatalities was Christopher Cox, 28. Another was Robert Wentzel, 24, called Ben. Both came to Broward County to enter treatment programs. "We were all so hopeful when he left for Florida," said Rebecca Wentzel Kniceley, of Lorain, Ohio. Ben was her only child. "He was very excited about going and made all the arrangements himself," she said. After his arrival in November, Wentzel went through detox and then found a room in a Fort Lauderdale sober house, a group home for recovering addicts. He later moved to an apartment with a roommate and started working in a bar on South Andrews Avenue. "He was making pretty good money," his mother said. Although he seemed to be doing well, Kniceley said she now knows that Ben was struggling with anxiety, drinking, using Xanax and battling demons that had plagued him since high school. Wentzel was found dead on a couch in his apartment, where investigators discovered syringes, Xanax and marijuana, the ME's office said. About 10 hours later, Cox was found unresponsive in a halfway house on Northeast 27th Street in Wilton Manors. He was on the floor, a baggie of white powdery residue nearby. "When we were younger, he seemed like a teenage boy withdrawing," said Cox's twin sister, Lyndsey Cox, of Newark, Del., where they were raised. Cox began drinking and using drugs such as oxycodone as a teen, dropped out of college and found work in a bar, his sister said. But when he began using heroin and "behaving angrily," Lyndsey Cox said, the family held an intervention. Her brother agreed to rehab and in December checked into a Lauderdale-by-the-Sea treatment center. "He seemed committed to treatment, and we felt we did get him back," Lyndsey Cox said. "He was working the steps." In July the family visited South Florida so the twins could celebrate their birthday together. "He was healthy, had put on weight, enjoyed his job," Cox said. "We went to the beach, out to dinner." So what happened? "I don't know if it was anything in particular that made him want to use again," Cox said. "Maybe he got frustrated and it was a reaction. Addiction is a disease; it changes the composition of your brain." 'The devil's drug' Heather Munro can attest to the powerful allure of opiates. At 38 she is a recovering addict who remembers her last dance with fentanyl about 15 months ago. With her daughter in the car, she and an ex-boyfriend pulled over to the side of State Road 84 to shoot up drugs they had just bought in Miami. Munro said she got out to fetch a diaper from the car's trunk, and that's the last thing she remembers. Paramedics found her passed out in the trunk, her ex-boyfriend unconscious in the car, the needle still in his arm. "I had a 1-year-old in the car," said Munro, who was raised in Davie. "But heroin is the devil's drug. You could be the best person in the world, but even before you use what you have you start worrying about the next fix, and the next one, the one after that." After that episode, Munro went to jail for three months, lost custody of her child and entered a Pembroke Pines treatment center. "Jail was the best thing that could have happened to me," Munro said. "I couldn't get out, couldn't pass go, I just sat there. It was rough love." Now employed, with her own apartment in Lauderdale Lakes, Munro has regained custody of her daughter and rekindled relationships with two older children from whom she was estranged. She has hope. "To others like me, I would say, go get help. I know you're in dark place right now, probably feel life doesn't mean anything to you, nobody cares about you, you probably burned all your bridges with family and friends," Munro said. "I had nobody, my family hated me, had no friends, just the people I used with, who weren't friends at all," she said. "I had no drive to live anymore. I figured I was just a junkie and would die a junkie. "But I learned you can do it if you want to. It's real. We do recover." 'It's like whack-a-mole' How South Florida's current drug crisis ends is not clear. In July Congress passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, expanding access to drugs to treat heroin overdoses and encourage treatment over incarceration. But while the bill authorized up to $181 billion in spending, only a fraction of that money was actually provided. "We have a highly addicted population, and we are a destination for recovery," said Heather Davidson, prevention specialist for the United Way of Broward's Commission on Substance Abuse. "So it's like whack-a-mole: You get one drug down and another pops up." Both Davidson and Hall fear that things will get worse before they get better. "The numbers [of overdoses] will continue to go up, and that's the immediate crisis," Davidson said. "How to triage these individuals, and then get them into treatment?" Hall emphasized the need for health care practitioners to be more cautious in prescribing opioids. He also called for an expansion of treatment opportunities covered by insurance. "It's shocking what's going on, and it's time we sound the alarm," Davidson said. "Maybe all the attention and the personal stories will call attention to this. Because I think people are hungry for solutions." mwclary@sunsentinel.com Copyright © 2016, Sun Sentinel Medical Research Crime Broward Health Medical Center Mike Stocker Sun Sentinel Heroin dealer linked to near-fatal overdose bragged on Facebook about escape, feds say sober homes All Sections News Sports Broward Palm Beach Entertainment Classified Obituaries 75°

Now even a key player doubts their accuracy. In the vast and complicated U.S. economy, it is rare for an individual to exert much control over the price of a major commodity. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 68.54 -0.65 -0.94% Pilgrims Pride Corp PPC ▼ 18.31 -0.30 -1.61% Sanderson Farms Inc SAFM ▼ 81.04 -0.98 -1.19% Tyson Foods Inc TSN ▲ 67.36 +0.66 +0.99% But then there is Arty G. Schronce and the price of chicken. As director of a bulletin from the Georgia Department of Agriculture, Schronce makes a weekly calculation that gives supermarkets around the country the going rate for a pound of chicken. The price average from Schronce directly affects what big retailers such as Walmart and Safeway pay for chicken — it’s often built into supermarket purchasing contracts — and that price is then passed along to shoppers. It has, in other words, affected billions of dollars in purchases. But has it been accurate? Recently, this influential estimate has drawn questions about whether it artificially inflated chicken prices and elicited scrutiny from the U.S. Agriculture Department. Now it turns out that even Schronce has harbored serious doubts about its accuracy, according to an internal document from the Georgia Department of Agriculture obtained by The Washington Post. Over the past two years, the price estimate, known within the industry as the “Georgia Dock,” has drifted significantly upward from other chicken price averages, rising about 20 percent or more out of line with a separate but lesser known index maintained by the USDA. A deviation in supermarket chicken prices of that magnitude would have cost U.S. grocery shoppers billions of dollars in recent years. Food price estimates such as the Georgia Dock affect the price of many perishable products — such as fruits, vegetables, nuts and livestock — because producers rely on them to set the terms of long-term contracts. Many of the price measures, used for decades, are products of long tradition.© Bob Andres/AP Photo The root of the trouble with the Georgia price estimate, as Schronce sees the matter, is that it is based on a price survey of eight anonymous chicken companies in the state, and he raised doubts whether those companies have been giving him accurate information. The chicken companies are not asked to show receipts or other documentation proving that their figures are accurate. “I have come to question the validity of some of the information provided,” he wrote in September in preparation for a meeting at the Georgia Department of Agriculture. “I do not think I am getting actual weighted average prices from some companies.” Schronce indicated in his memo that he had been contacted by an investigator from the antitrust division of the Florida attorney general. Moreover, in recent months, the USDA discontinued publishing the Georgia figure, citing its inability to verify the information. Poultry is big business in Georgia, with sales exceeding $4 billion annually. An upward bias in the chicken prices would increase revenue for those Georgia companies as well as any others that sell in the United States. Some of the nation’s largest chicken producers — including Tysons, Pilgrim’s Pride, Perdue and Sanderson Farms — have had plants in the state. As Schronce noted, the state’s poultry companies benefit from the Georgia Dock because it costs them nothing and yields prices that are seen as higher. Schronce did not respond to invitations to comment. The Georgia Department of Agriculture defended the accuracy of the influential price estimate and said that it is addressing the issues raised by Schronce’s document. “All of the concerns addressed in the document are now being addressed internally,” spokesperson Julie McPeake said in a statement. “It is our responsibility at the Georgia Department of Agriculture to report the data we have received from the companies consistently and accurately.” McPeake said the Georgia Dock index reflects prices of a distinct type of bird and customer. For that reason, the index could have rightfully diverged from other chicken prices. “We trust the companies we work with,” Alec Asbridge, director of regulatory compliance at Georgia Department of Agriculture, said earlier this month. “We don’t see any reason they would submit information that wasn’t truthful.” The Georgia Dock, which has been around for decades, is influential because so many grocery chains use it in their contracts with chicken companies. While many chicken companies and retailers are secretive about how they set prices for buying and selling chicken, some very large players have acknowledged that the Georgia Dock is the basis of, or a factor in, the price they pay for chicken. “Over time, most retail grocery customers and their suppliers have come to trust the Georgia Dock whole bird price quoted weekly by the Georgia Department of Agriculture as the most reliable reflection of the supply and demand dynamics of the fresh chicken market,” officials at Sanderson Farms, one of the nation’s largest chicken producers, wrote to the SEC earlier this year. For all but one of Sanderson’s supermarket customers, the price is based on the Georgia Dock. Tyson Foods said a small portion of their supermarket contracts is “connected” to the Georgia Dock. A spokesman for Pilgrim’s Pride said that less than 5 percent of its sales are currently tied to the Georgia Dock, but company officials have repeatedly referred to the price index in calls with investors and analysts. Among supermarkets, Walmart, Safeway and others confirmed using the Georgia Dock, as well as other factors, when negotiating chicken prices. For all of its influence, however, the way it is calculated appears to have been somewhat haphazard. In the three-page document, entitled “Notes for meeting,” Schronce portrays himself as someone who was poorly prepared for the job of producing the index and who was treated contemptuously by the chicken companies from whom he was eliciting price information. Schronce came into the job of producing the estimate, part of the “Georgia Poultry Market News,” just a few years ago. He has previously authored a gardening blog, “Arty’s Garden,” for the Department of Agriculture and is seen in a Youtube video extolling the virtues of a native vine known as Carolina Jessamine. The blog describes him as “a lifelong gardener and a horticulture graduate of North Carolina State University.”© Provided by WP Company LLC d/b/a The Washington Post Arty Schronce, a Georgia Department of Agriculture employee, calculates an important chicken price index every week but has come to doubt its accuracy. Photo credit: Georgia Department of Agriculture via youtube.com “My training was inadequate, inconsistent and sometimes in error,” Schronce wrote of his preparation for calculating the Georgia Dock. Moreover, the companies he was required to survey were surly and sometimes unresponsive. “I often received lackadaisical and rude responses to my requests for information,” Schronce wrote. Sometimes his calls were not returned, and sometimes the companies simply responded to his price questions with “just keep ’em the same.” Companies said they had provided accurate information when surveyed. Tysons said in a statement: “When the Georgia Department of Agriculture asks us for pricing data, we provide accurate information based on actual and recent transactions. We do not see the prices reported by our competitors to the Georgia Department of Agriculture.” Finally, the Schronce document suggests that the chicken industry may have too much sway over how the Georgia Department of Agriculture goes about computing the chicken price index. Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, who was president of the Georgia Agribusiness Council, lobbied for the agriculture industry for years before winning election in November 2010. Schronce questioned the role that an advisory board composed of poultry industry executives has in shaping the chicken price estimate. “I have questions about the ‘Advisory Board’ and its role over an office of a state regulatory agency that is supposed to be independent,” Schronce wrote. “I was told I could not make any changes without clearing them with the Advisory Board.” He added he has “voiced concerns in the past.” McPeake, of the Georgia Department of Agriculture, said a review process began in December 2015 after “serious concerns” emerged. She said that while Schronce’s training “may have been abridged due to unfortunate and unforeseen circumstances, every effort was made to ensure that he was indeed trained on some level.” “I took and continue to take this job very seriously,” Schronce wrote. “However, my concern and my efforts can no longer overcome the diminished knowledge and experience and the inadequate staffing at both the Georgia Department of Agriculture and the reporting poultry companies.” Go to MSN Home More in Money 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money What Trump's win could mean for older Americans CBS News 30 things you should never buy without a coupon GOBankingRates 6 brand mascots that actually existed in real life Business Insider 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money Up Next The most dangerous states in America 24/7 Wall St. AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from The Washington Post Washington-area appointments and promotions for Nov. 21 The Washington Post Washington-area bankruptcy filing for the week of Nov. 21, 2016 The Washington Post Mike Pence has been here before: Booed at an Indiana baseball game, then ‘Hamilton’ The Washington Post How Republicans and Democrats can come together to fix Obamacare The Washington Post The Washington Post View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

Absolutely, Walmart remains the biggest store in in the Black Friday shopping spree. At first, Walmart’s ads leaked in the web early for the shoppers to grasp what’s inside the store on Black Friday. Walmart is one of the most avidly awaited Black Friday ads of the season, and for some great reasons. While many retailers offer not more than few doorbuster deals on electronics, Walmart is an outlier. Year after year, they don’t fail to impress the buyer with their blown away deals and 2016 is no exception. Walmart Black Friday 2016 ad sales include 50% more innovative inventory compare to last year, so that buyers expectations are met! To the curb the demand for high-end doorbuster deals, Walmart once again will shell out wristbands (distribution time vary from one place to other) so that buyers are sure to get what they want. This year they have also added 1-Hour Guaranteed slot and store map for higher convenience of shoppers. People with Walmart will have exclusive deals including Hitachi 65″ 4K Ultra HDTV for $599 and Cricut Explore One Special Edition Bluetooth Bundle for $169.00, so make sure you download the Walmart app for free. Walmart Black Friday 2016 ad sales begin at 6PM on Thanksgiving and online sale begin at 12am on 24th November. Deals on gaming consoles are one best we have seen at Walmart Black Friday. After reducing $50 on the original price Walmart is offering Xbox One S 500GB Battlefield 1 Bundle at $249 only. Bundle fans can take advantage of buying Xbox 360 500GB Forza Horizon 2 Bundle at $129 only which was $50 higher. There are assortment of products at $39 including Xbox One White (Black option) Controller, Lego Dimensions Starter Pack (PS4), Playstation 4 Controller (Assorted Designs) and Skylanders Starter Pack (PS4) all comes after huge price cut. Only Walmart can offer you Call of Duty Infinite Warfare Legacy Edition (PS4) (XONE option) at $57 (was $79) and a special buy of Call of Duty Black Ops Collection (X360) (PS4 Option) at $25 each. We have not seen such huge collection of titles starting from $8 as available at Walmart. You can buy Call Of Duty Ghosts (X360) and many such titles at $8 (open to buy now at $7.60 with Walmart Website). For some other great titles look at the range of special buy comprising Overwatch Origins Edition (PS4), NHL 17 (PS4) and more at $35. Under the toys range, Walmart has done great work to steal the show. You will find Hot Wheels Ultimate Garage at $74 ($14 savings) and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles RC Mikey at $39 ($10 savings).

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it Illustration by Dan Matutina for The Washington Post By Hayley Tsukayama November 18 Follow @htsuka It is a sad truth for technology enthusiasts that it’s almost the end of 2016, and we still don’t have flying cars, a moon colony or fully functional robot butlers. But there is at least one sci-fi technology that is aiming to make a breakthrough into your living room: virtual reality. Companies big and small are betting that holiday shoppers will get the appeal of being able to pop on a headset and immerse their eyes and ears — and sometimes their hands and feet — in another world. Google, Sony, Samsung, Facebook and HTC are among the major manufacturers that have put virtual reality products, mostly for playing games, on the market in the past several months. And retailers such as Walmart and Best Buy are building the excitement by setting up demonstration areas in their stores so consumers can get a good feel for these unfamiliar devices. “For most people . . . this will be their first real opportunity to play with or experience virtual reality,” said Clifton Dawson, chief executive of the market research firm Greenlight VR. “What is really important here is the reaction we’ll see from consumers who walk in these stores and get educated about it for the first time.” That could make this holiday season a critical period for VR, which is trying to prove it’s not just a gimmick like some gaming trends before it. (Remember the Wii and the Kinect?) Research firm IDC estimates that consumers — particularly gamers — will snap up 9.6 million virtual reality headsets by the end of the year, spending about $2.6 billion. Gamers, Dawson said, are an obvious key market to watch but so are those looking to use the virtual reality headsets for a family purchase, to replace screen time spent together on the computer to share funny videos or websites, or watching television. Greg Hall, Walmart’s senior vice president for entertainment, said he expects that gaming will remain tech’s big draw in the near term — but people are “warming up” to virtual reality. “We like the growth,” he said. “We like VR and think it’s got some nice legs for us.” The full potential of the virtual reality market is still quite a few years away, analysts say. And, in a reversal of the timeline that characterized technologies such as desktops, laptops and cellphones, the appetite for virtual reality is expected to start with average people buying them for their own personal use before the devices break into the business world. Greenlight VR believes the trend will be driven by consumer adoption through 2019, but that applications for business — including education, training and telecommuting — will start to make up the lion’s share of the market after that. The company projects that VR will become a $36 billion industry within the next decade. A two-tiered market Given how early in the VR trend we are, there’s a surprising variety of virtual reality headsets on the market. They come in two main types: Some are self-contained and are used primarily for high-end video games; they allow you to step completely into the virtual world and interact with it. Others work only with your smartphone, and are better suited to passively viewing specially designed 360-degree photos and videos — a super-modern update of the 19th-century stereoscopes that used to show kids slides of the wider world. If you’re skeptical of virtual reality but are intrigued by more immersive digital experiences, you may want to consider one of the latter type — say the Google Cardboard viewer. It works with smartphones up to six inches high and costs just $15. Other manufacturers are selling cardboard viewers online for even less — some as little as $5. These are good stocking stuffers for those who want to dip a toe in the virtual reality world, or for families with lots of kids who all want their own viewers. (There’s a reason Google has marketed these heavily to classrooms.) News organizations and other outlets post photos and videos for Google Cardboard on social media, and there are also apps for Android and iOS that work with the viewer to send users on virtual trips around the world, for example, or put them on stage with Paul McCartney in concert. For a little more polish, you can step up to something like the Google Daydream View or the Samsung Gear VR, which still run off the smartphone but provide a higher-quality experience. The Daydream View, Google’s $79 cloth and plastic headset, also comes with a remote that will let you play and interact with some basic games. And it’s much more comfortable to use — it stays put on your head with a strap, so you don’t have to hold it up. The Samsung Gear VR is also powered by a smartphone, but it has to be a Galaxy smartphone — specifically, the Galaxy S6 and newer models. With a touch-sensitive control pad on the side of the goggles, the Gear VR is a better choice for light gaming and has a number of high-profile titles including “Minecraft.” At $99, it’s far pricier than a cardboard reader, but it’s a far better experience. Getting serious If you’re super-serious and want something that actually lets you interact with the digital world, there are essentially three headset models to choose from: the HTC Vive, the PlayStation VR and the Oculus Rift. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Both the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift will require connection to a high-end personal computer to work properly — a computer that itself could cost users at least $1,000 to put together if they don’t have a VR-ready computer already. There are some hidden costs as well. The $799 HTC Vive, for example, does an amazing job of tricking your senses into believing that you’re in a digital world. You really feel as if you can interact with the virtual environment, and several clever software tricks mean that you don’t ever find yourself groping blind for a dropped game controller. One reason it’s so effective is it gives you a lot of in-world space in which to move, and a lot of sensors with which to track those movements. The downside? You have to give up a lot of real-world space: a suggested minimum of 5 feet by 6.5 feet. You’ll also have to find room to plug in seven pieces of equipment: the computer, monitor, headset, chargers and sensors. That’s fine for a man-cave, but not so much for a studio apartment. The $599 Rift doesn’t require as much space. In fact, some of its best experiences take place when you’re seated, which means it can be used in a normal office or living room. Its pair of hand controllers, called the Oculus Touch, also let you interact smoothly with the digital world, though they’re not always quite as sensitive — or easy to find when dropped — as those of the Vive. The Rift shines, however, in the overall quality of its software. As one of the first companies to raise mainstream awareness of virtual reality, Oculus took pains to minimize some of the more unpleasant side effects of moving through a VR world, with rock-solid tracking that should keep all but the most sensitive player from feeling too much motion sickness. Finally, Sony’s PlayStation VR has the advantage of working automatically with the PlayStation 4 and the newly released PlayStation 4 Pro. That means it doesn’t require an extra computer and runs off the game console that its target audience knows and probably already owns. Among these three high-end headsets, PlayStation VR is also the most comfortable to wear for long periods of time. And it’s just $400 — though you’ve already paid a few hundred for your PlayStation. If you really want to buy a VR headset but are still having trouble figuring out what works for you, don’t forget to compare each headset’s unique catalog of games first, to narrow down their options. Or you could take a year or two to think about it. While the hype machine is in full force right now, and consumers are responding, that doesn’t mean that failing to buy a VR headset this year will make you the lamest house on the block. Even VR evangelists don’t see the technology truly becoming mainstream for another couple of years, and that’s if all goes well. So if you postpone the decision, you may not be on the cutting edge this holiday season; but you may also save yourself some money and space if the analysts’ forecasts are wrong. business true Please provide a valid email address.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Hatchimals: The Best Stores To Find Eggs Posted: Nov 19 2016, 6:17am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 19 2016, 3:22pm CST, in News | Holiday Gift Guide   This story may contain affiliate links.   The Hatchimals don't teach kids how to code, but they are the hottest holiday toy of the year. There are plenty of Holiday toy robots on the market that would teach your kids how to code, but all they want apparently is a Hatchimals Egg. The Hatchimals surfaced in stores in October and have rapidly evolved in the hottest Holiday toy. Youtube is to blame for the hype around Hatchimals in a big way. Toy Maker underestimated the demand and can't make enough Hatchimals for the Holidays. Don't Miss: The Black Friday 2016 Deals on Sale Now Update 3:54pm ET: Walmart just sold new Hatchimals inventory online at walmart.com. It was a big burst featuring stock of Pink Penguala, Burtle, and Draggle. I was able to bag two in the shopping cart. This was a sizable sale, but it still sold out in one minute. The Draggle lasted for two minutes. Walmart is apparently still selling Hatchimals online despite the upcoming Black Friday sale on Thanksgiving. At least there is still new inventory showing up each day reportedly in stores and over the past weeks online stores have offered almost every day a limited inventory. Nintendo is not even able to supply new NES Classic Edition inventory a week after the sell-out launch. The chances to find a Hatchimals in stock are much higher than finding a NES Classic in stock. Just this morning there have been Penguala Hatchimals in stock at ToysRUs online. Because of the rarity of new online inventory, the Hatchimals have sold out in mere seconds. As reported, we believe scalpers have also tasked their bot scripts to harvest Hatchimals.  Your best bet to find Hatchimals in stock this morning is at your local mall. Walmart, Target and ToysRUs stores have reportedly been getting new inventory on a daily basis. One of our reporters visited a Target Store this week to talk about the Hatchimals stock situation and to find out how parents can get their hands on a Hatchimals egg at Target. Another report confirmed that Walmart stores are getting new Hatchimals daily. The best strategy is to visit your local Walmart, Target and ToysRUs stores early in the morning. It is best to show up before the doors open, to not miss a potention overnight restocking of Hatchimals. In case there is empty shelf space where the Hatchimals are supposed to be, ask store employees when the store is restocking Hatchimals. This method is your best chance to find Hatchimals right now. You might be meeting your local Hatchimals prospectors when you show up at the time the Hatchimals get restocked. These people make about $150 profit in reselling Hatchimals on amazon.com. We have put together an extensive Hatchimals shopping guide that features a list of all stores known to potentially have Hatchimals in stock. Walmart has advertised Hatchimals in the Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad. The retailer will be forced now to stock Hatchimals in each of their stores for Thanksgiving to not suffer a huge backlash from customers. There have been reports about Hatchimals not hatching or stop working. Most of these customer reports stem from October, but there is a chance that the Hatchimals will not hatch or work on Christmas when your kids unwrap them. There could though be a simple solution to the problem. Spin Master released a video that explains everthing you need to know about Hatchimals and how to use them.

Remaking North Fort Myers means luring millennials, consultant says BILL SMITH , BSMITH@NEWS-PRESS.COM 9:05 a.m. EST November 19, 2016 North Fort Myers' future may lie in its transformation to a "downtown center" with white collar jobs and improved housing inspiring a commercial and cultural renaissance Buy Photo Looking south at Fort Myers from the North Shore Park.

(Photo: Andrea Melendez/The News-Press)Buy Photo Once the scene of parking lots filled with customers scurrying to a Walmart or the Kash N' Karry grocery, Hancock Bridge Square in North Fort Myers now offers little to lure people with money to spend. The once-thriving 14-acre shopping plaza on U.S. 41, south of Pondella Road, is now the scene of a sweeping array of vacant storefronts, spreading potholes and a depressed truck bay so steeped in stormwater run-off that it has turned into an algae-filled summer swimming hole. "We were told they're going to rebuild it; they're going to tear it down and build condos; they're going to bring Hancock Bridge Road through," said Debra Gadis, whose salon is the sole business at one end of the complex and one of only five that remain. There has been no reconstruction, no upgrades, and entering the parking lot in the rainy season is an act of faith that electrical components in one's vehicle are high enough off the ground to navigate steep puddles. Vacancies are testimony to the simple fact that there isn't enough money in the lower end of North Fort Myers to sustain the number of retail business that can fit along U.S. 41 and its business spur to the east. "We have a dead plaza in what you can consider a dead area with mobile homes and transients," Gadis said. An early draft of a county commissioned study of the area between U.S. 41 and Business 41, from the Caloosahatchee River to Pondella Road says the future of North Fort Myers may lie in its transformation from a center of struggling shopping plazas and long-abandoned franchise stores into a downtown-style business center spawning a decidedly white collar population of millennials with money to spend on their lifestyles. Waiting for people with disposable income to simply move in and start spending hasn't worked.  Today's residents of the trailer parks and bungalows that fill the side streets in the area spend their incomes on survival. "Many once-thriving businesses are in financial distress,vacancies are visibly prevalent and many properties are for sale," said the draft report from a consortium headed by DCG Corplan Consulting, a New Jersey-based economic development consulting firm. The preliminary report was made available to county officials last week. Buy Photo The entrance to one of several mobile home parks that sits just over the HWY 41 Bridge.

Natural geography contributes an  "obvious site advantage," to North Fort Myers, as the twin U.S. 41 highways bring traffic through its commercial core, providing access to the Caloosahatchee and Edison bridges that frame a potentially idyllic riverfront expanse. It's a scene steeped in potential, offering North Shore Park as a riverfront destination. The views, though, are obscured by a patchwork of businesses, some gritty, some potential jewels, and many ravaged by time after the death of an entrepreneur's dream. The preliminary study predicts creation of office-oriented businesses that offer the prospect of  "modest growth" in retail business. It envisions a healthy increase in white collar occupations as the area's savior. Thriving businesses staffed by a millennial generation workforce would create demand for housing and services, the study suggests. The goal is "growth in management, business, science and arts occupations, helping the market for educational services, information technology, healthcare and real estate businesses, among others." Existing businesses, even those not struggling, see a benefit to new businesses luring people, even to new competitors.

"You're not only adjacent to downtown Fort Myers, but property prices would be much less than over there." Browning, a veteran Lee County restaurateur, says the Best Western was booked "earlier and fuller" for the tourist season than in recent years. He sees creation of a healthy permanent economy in North Fort Myers as something that will help all  businesses '"Season is going to happen, no matter what," he said.  "Creating destinations is huge in marketing areas." THE NEWS-PRESS Vacant stores adding up in North Fort Myers Bringing a permanent population to North Fort Myers would augment those already living in waterfront towers and a large gated community on Hancock Bridge Parkway. "Not a lot of folks live around there," said District 4 County Commissioner Brian Hamman, who represents the area.  "Folks travel through — from North Fort Myers and Cape Coral to downtown." Hamman, who requested the study, noted that many of the vacant storefronts were vacant even before the recession. He says, however, even the "really great suggestions require some discussion of how deeply government should get involved. "I'm on the limited government side of the spectrum," Hamman said. "Government has a real role to build infrastructure and cut red tape to create the right conditions so that private enterprises would want to buy and invest in the area." Business owners thirst for a year-round population that would drive business 12 months a year.

"It's because of who lives in the area." If grand plans to remake what has been marketed as "the opportunity side of the river" gain a toehold, displacement would appear inevitable. DCG Corplan, which is being paid by the county, says county property tax revenues would be "significantly higher" if a new population replaced the area's mobile home parks and bungalows, now "located on sites that, if redeveloped, would command higher and better uses." The consultants see a spin-off effect that could see the tired dwellings of the Cabana City neighborhood translated into a trendy "niche"  housing neighborhood featuring "old-Florida charm."

The store sells flooring and wall materials that are a step up from the contractor grade materials used in a lot of new construction, and faces competition from discounters dealing in factory seconds. His market is people building their own homes and new buyers or long-term residents who want upgrades. His base includes residents of the Moody River community and the riverfront condos. The area near his shop, located adjacent to the Hope Hospice thrift center, have not been able to lift his business completely out of years of economic stagnation. "It's starting to come back, but slowly,"  Vargeson said. "These sort of people don't have the money to pay for the more expensive things."

What they discovered has undermined trust in a global luxury product and set off a salvo of class-action lawsuits that have created a king-sized public relations challenge for the Indian textiles industry and the US companies it supplies. Turns out that major American retailers, including Target and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., have been selling premium-priced sheets purportedly made of Egyptian cotton - a byword for luxury in linens - but that may in reality be woven with lower-quality cotton blends. Three suits seeking to be certified as class-actions have been filed against supplier Welspun India - and a separate one last week was directed at Wal-Mart. The complaint, filed in New York by customer Dorothy Monahan, accuses the world’s largest retailer of questioning the fibre content of Welspun’s products as early as 2008, but not halting its sales until after Target did so in August. Wal-Mart said it will “vigorously defend” itself. The other lawsuits, all filed in the US against Welspun, allege the company fraudulently labelled its bed sheets as Egyptian cotton. Welspun declined to comment on the suits. MD Rajesh Mandawewala told analysts during a conference call in August that “the error is on our side so we have to take responsibility for it.” Target, meanwhile, hasn’t been sued. “The marketing has created this image in our heads that high-quality cotton and Egypt are synonymous,” said Louis Rose, a Memphis, Tennessee-based cotton industry consultant. “Consumers should be sceptical of these marketing claims. They’ll be under a lot more scrutiny now.” Exhaustive work The fake Egyptian sheet episode came to light after exhaustive work by Target investigators who analysed sheet fibres under microscopes and tracked their journey through a global supply chain. The probe found that 750 000 of Target’s “Egyptian cotton” sheets, sold for as much as $75 a pop, didn’t contain any Egyptian cotton at all, but an amalgam of lower-quality fibres from cheaper sources. That July discovery touched off a scandal spanning from Minnesota to Mumbai and Cairo that threatens the future of Welspun, part of a $3 billion conglomerate headed by entrepreneur Balkrishan Goenka. It may also hobble Indian textile manufacturers in the race to supply Western consumers with high-quality sheets and towels, creating an opening for competitors from China and elsewhere to grab the business, according to industry analysts. The Welspun-made sheets Target examined were sold under the Fieldcrest brand. While it has interests in steel, energy, and infrastructure, textiles are the bread and butter for Welspun, which says it supplies one in five towels sold in America and posted revenue of about $900 million in the 2016 fiscal year. Tennis stars like Roger Federer mop their brows with Welspun towels at the Wimbledon championships - a fact the company highlights in investor presentations. Target has cut ties and ended all of its $90 million in annual business with the company. Wal-Mart Stores and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. also stopped selling Welspun sheets that had been labelled 100 percent Egyptian cotton. Those are significant blows coming from some of Welspun’s biggest customers, and have sent its stock down about 40 percent since August. 19 when Target announced its decision. The sheets fiasco reflects a simple reality: There’s a scarcity of Egyptian cotton. It first became a key export product in the early 19th century, when it arrived in France and became sought after for its silky feel. Production has been falling since the 1990s, however, and last year Egypt’s post-revolutionary military government ended subsidies for cotton farmers to shore up the state budget. A gradual decline in output has become a precipitous plunge. The US Department of Agriculture estimates there will be a 53 percent decrease in production this year, to an all-time low of 160 000 bales. The system for certifying Egyptian cotton is administered from Cairo by the Cotton Egypt Association, an industry group that grants stamps of approval to suppliers of 100-percent Egyptian cotton products. To receive one, CEA executive director Khaled Schuman explained, a manufacturer pays an initial fee of $5,000 and submits records of Egyptian cotton purchases and product samples, which undergo DNA analysis to identify whether the fibres were grown in Egypt or elsewhere. The companies are charged an additional $3 000 annually for the certification, according to Schuman. No supervision But once a certification is granted, producers are mostly left alone until they need to renew their label a year later. “You can’t put an employee from the association on each production line to inspect” every item being produced, said Mohamed Negm, who conducts testing of certification samples for the association to verify the fibres are Egyptian-grown. Typically, suppliers like Welspun purchase cotton in raw form from Egypt for import to Asia, where it’s turned into finished products for sale in the US and elsewhere, he said. The highest-quality Egyptian material costs twice as much as the standard grade sourced from India, providing a powerful incentive to cheat. “Factories have mixed the Egyptian cotton with other low quality cottons to make profit, which has ruined the reputation of Egyptian cotton,” said Negm, adding that’s what the DNA testing and certification aim to curtail. During the set-up of the CEA’s DNA testing program, Negm said, it started analysing random samples taken from store shelves globally; 90 percent were fake, mixed with low-quality cottons from the likes of Sudan, Burkina Faso and Pakistan. “It’s very easy to play it loose during the production process if you want,” said Liu Dang Dang, a foreign sales manager at Chinese manufacturer Jihua 3542 Textile US retailers “should have realised how obvious it is,” he said, adding that the company, which supplies Egyptian cotton fabric to manufacturers in the US and Europe, doesn’t engage in the practice. “The price they want to pay for Egyptian cotton sheets is so low when the price of Egyptian cotton is so high.” Widespread blending Blending is widespread in the industry and quietly tolerated by many retail chains, according to two executives at producers other than Welspun who asked not to be identified discussing the procedure. Sometimes that means mixing good-quality non-Egyptian cotton that maintains the same feel amid shortages of the real thing, but it also often includes using cheaper grades to save money, said the people, citing their experience with cotton processing departments and export requirements for US retailers. The CEA formally announced its DNA testing program in April, saying the “gold seal” it would give manufacturers who passed would help “rid the supply chain of falsely labelled goods.” Awkwardly, the first company to receive a gold seal was Welspun, for bed linens as well as towels and bath rugs. Target has decided not to rely on CEA certifications going forward, according to a person familiar with the retailer’s decisions who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. Wal-Mart, by contrast, has said it will continue to rely on the CEA standard. Schuman said the organisation is “making good efforts to make the system tougher” to avoid future problems, for example by increasing the role of third-party auditors and monitoring suppliers’ inventories more closely. After discovering problems with Welspun sheets, Target quickly decided to terminate its entire relationship with the company, citing “the trust that our guests place in us.” It also opted to offer refunds to customers who’d purchased them -- even if they’d been sleeping on them for years. Wal-Mart has also offered refunds. Although Welspun knew Target was investigating its products, its executives believed that, at worst, the retailer would drop only its Egyptian cotton sheets, according to a person privy to the discussions. Target didn’t warn Welspun beforehand about its August. 19 announcement that it was ending all its business ties, the person said, which left the company blindsided. At the time chairman Goenka’s wife Dipali, who leads Welspun’s home textile business, had just returned to India from meetings in the U.S.; she turned around immediately to do damage-control with clients, according to a person familiar with the events. In Mumbai, her husband had called an emergency meeting of department heads. He told them to ignore the company’s plunging share price and to focus on their day jobs, and that Welspun would bounce back over time, the person said. Both Goenkas declined to be interviewed. Welspun, which has said the issue never affected the quality or safety of its products, hired the audit firm EY to evaluate its practices and supply chain. The company reports quarterly earnings Tuesday. The scandal is creating an opportunity for rival Indian supplier Trident, which has picked up a significant chunk of Welspun’s business from Wal-Mart, Target and Ikea, said a person familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Welspun is still a supplier for Ikea, according to a spokesperson for the Swedish company, adding that it does not buy products made from Egyptian cotton due to sustainability concerns. The company did not respond to a query on whether it’s awarded contracts to Trident. Chinese textile producers may also benefit, analysts said. Big US retailers tend to “go for Indian companies because they are cheaper,” particularly thanks to lower labor costs, said Jack Yang, an executive at Chinese manufacturer Yantai Pacific Home Fashion. Scarce cotton Anyone trying to capitalise, though, faces the same problem: a shortage of Egyptian cotton. That, in turn, might assist U.S. manufacturers of Pima cotton, another high-quality grade that promotes itself as a rival to the Egyptian variety. Back in Cairo, the guardians of the country’s sole global brand argue their efforts will be enough to rein in fakes, and they say the controversy might even have a silver lining. “If what was happening had continued, in a few years there would be zero Egyptian cotton,” Schuman said. “The turbulence now is positive. It’s raising awareness, and we are doing everything we can to protect the value of our product.” BLOOMBERG International Fedusa's new head to fight for fair wages for all Recommended National Minimum Wage set at R20 per hour SA to pursue decent standard of living for all Time abroad can crystallise career ideas Certainty, growth key in credit grade Most Read Union joins ‘Zuma must go’ chorus Junk rating inevitable for SA?

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Nov 19, 2016 at 7:21AM Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) has been a staple holding in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B)(NYSE:BRK-A) portfolio for years, but the Oracle of Omaha has soured on Wal-Mart's stock this year, and a new report from the U.S. Census Bureau showing that consumers continue to embrace e-commerce may mean that there's a good chance that Wal-Mart's completely out of Berkshire's portfolio by the end of this year.  IMAGE SOURCE: WAL-MART STORES. What's up? Wal-Mart may be a retail store Goliath, but it's far from the biggest online retailer, and that's a big problem for the company's future growth.. Wal-Mart's sales barely budged in the third quarter, increasing by a only a modest 0.5% from the third quarter of 2015. Meanwhile, consumers ongoing shift to online shopping propelled sales at online giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) 29% higher when compared to a year ago. According to the Census Bureau, that trend away from retail stores to online stores isn't losing steam. In Q3, U.S. retail e-commerce sales, adjusted for seasonal variation but not for price changes, grew 4% quarter over quarter to $101.3 billion. That handily outpaced the 0.9% quarter-over-quarter increase in total retail sales in the period, but the gap between the two is even wider when considering the year-over-year change. Compared to Q3 2015, adjusted e-commerce sales grew 15.7% last quarter, while total retail sales only grew 2.2%. Overall, the rapid growth in online purchases has led to e-commerce sales now accounting for 8.4% of total sales, up from 7.4% of sales a year ago. Growth in online shopping has been a boon to Wal-Mart competitors, especially Amazon. Online retailers have more inventory and marketing flexibility, and they also have cost advantages that help them compete better for wallet share. Trailing-12-month SG&A as a percentage of sales is more than 1% lower at Amazon than it is at Wal-Mart, and Amazon's gross profit margin is nearly 10% better than Wal-Mart's. AMZN gross profit margin (TTM) data by YCharts. Given that it's most likely that more consumer spending will migrate away from traditional stores to the internet, it's little wonder that investors like Buffett might be worrying more about Wal-Mart's future sales and profit headwinds. A tough competitor Earlier this year, Buffett praised Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, calling him a "genius." And at Berkshire Hathaway's annual investor event in Omaha, Buffett remarked, "We're not going to out-Bezos Bezos." In the past, Buffett was slow to embrace the use of the internet to boost sales at Berkshire Hathaway's wholly owned companies. However, that's recently been changing, and as he sees the sales tailwinds at his companies from his online initiatives, it may be factoring into his increasing admiration of Bezos, and his declining interest in owning bricks-and-mortar companies like Wal-Mart. It's probably not lost on Buffett that Amazon has been a much better investment than Wal-Mart over the years, either. Under Bezos' leadership, Amazon's trailing-12-month revenue has surged to $128 billion since 1994, and that's resulted in astonishing returns for long-term investors. Over the past 15 years, Amazon's 34%-per-year average return crushes the average 12.9% return for the specialty retail industry, and it absolutely demolishes Wal-Mart's 3.2% annual return over the period. Since Bezos doesn't appear ready to quit anytime soon, and e-commerce still represents less than 10% of total retail spending, it seems Wal-Mart's going to have its hands full for a long time if its going to attempt to keep Amazon at bay. Looking forward Buffett's sold tens of millions of shares in Wal-Mart this year, but he still has 12.9 million shares left in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. With Wal-Mart shares up 19% this year, he appears to see this as a great opportunity to "sell high" a business that could face increasingly more downside profit pressure in the coming years. Whether Buffett does sell his remaining Wal-Mart shares this year won't be known until early next year, when Berkshire Hathaway files its fourth-quarter 13F report with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But given his admiration for Bezos and his selling of 27.2 million Wal-Mart shares last quarter, I will not be surprised if Wal-Mart disappears from Berkshire's list of holdings.  Todd Campbell has no position in any stocks mentioned. Todd owns E.B.

Many retailers that will be opening their stores on Thanksgiving will also offer the same or comparable Doorbuster Deals online. Here are five chains offering deals worth checking out on Thanksgiving. Walmart OK, your local Superstore may be the last place you want to be on Thanksgiving Day, when Walmart will opens at 6 p.m. but the online deals start even earlier – at 12 a.m. Thursday morning. That means you can score a great deal on electronics while stuffing the turkey and never have to risk getting into a fist fight over the last big-screen TV in the store. Some of the better deals include a 55” Phillips Class Smart 4K TV for $298, a Roku Espress Plus for $25 and a Samsung Chromebook 3 for $119. Best Buy This retail chain promises “thousands of deals” for Black Friday but 16 of the most tempting are available online now so you don’t have to wait for stores to open at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving. The online action starts at 12 a.m. and Best Buy is holding out these Doorbusters for the big day: a Toshiba 49” 4K Ultra HDTV for $199.99, the Amazon 16GB Fire Tablet for $59.99 and Powerbeats2 Wireless Headphones for $89.99. Kohl’s The best thing about Kohl’s Black Friday sale is that it starts on Monday, November 21 and runs until 1 p.m. on Friday. The in-store sale begins at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving. Hot items available online Monday include a Haier 49” 4K Ultra HDTV plus $75 in Kohl’s Cash for $349.99, a Fitbit Alta special edition fitness band for $99.99 and 50% off name brand toys. Target The Thanksgiving fun starts at 6 p.m. in-stores and online for Target but there are several hot deals available now and until November 24. These include a Samsung 55” 4K Motion Rate 120 Curved Smart Ultra HDTV with a free $75 Target gift card for $697.99, an XBox One S console bundle with free $40 Target gift card for $249.99 and 50% off life-sized figurine toys including Star Wars.

Election didn't change our shopping habits 'We remain optimistic,' Target CEO says Video Photo College senior Alison Catalano is all smiles after finding the bed spread she'd been looking for at the Lake Zurich Target store on Thursday, Aug. 11, 2016 in Lake Zurich, Ill. Catalano was out shopping for furnishings for her 1st apartment as she goes into her senior year at St. Mary's of Notre Dame in South Bend. She is studying art education. (Stacey Wescott/Chicago Tribune) Washington Post Nov 18, 2016 at 4:40 pm | Print View The presidential election results may have changed a great many things: Your dinner table conversations, for example, and the kinds of posts in your Facebook feed. But executives at major retailers say they’re betting that the political climate will do little to alter your shopping habits this holiday season. “We haven’t really seen any noticeable change in sentiment in our customers,” said Greg Foran, Wal-Mart’s U.S. chief executive, on a Thursday conference call when asked whether the election would have an effect on the business. Foran’s comments echo what Brian Cornell, the chief executive of Target, said Wednesday when asked a similar question. “We remain very optimistic about the holiday season,” Cornell said, referring to economic factors such as a low unemployment rate. Both retailers reported relatively upbeat earnings results this week, adding to evidence that the retail industry is headed into the holiday shopping season with a tail wind. In its U.S. division, Wal-Mart saw a 1.2 percent increase in comparable sales, a measure of sales online and at stores open more than a year. The uptick came as the retailer did a better job of keeping store shelves well-stocked, and as its online sales heated up. This time around, e-commerce accounted for a greater share of the growth on this metric than in any previous quarter. Target reported improvement on some key measures: Foot traffic to its stores grew in the most recent quarter, and strong sales during the busy back-to-school shopping season helped narrow its decline in comparable sales. The retailer said it also has benefited from a recent change to its marketing tactics, in which it has moved to put a bigger spotlight on value and low prices. Macy’s and Kohl’s also reported stronger-than-expected earnings results last week. And the Commerce Department said Tuesday that retail sales were up 0.8 percent in October, a robust showing that suggests consumers are feeling relatively confident.

Friday, November 18, 2016 Share this Email, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn Discuss 5 comments Advertisement What does “Make America Great Again” really mean? MAGA was the slogan of the Donald Trump campaign. It was both inspirational and vague enough that citizens could project their individual ideas, hopes and dreams into it, much as citizens projected into Barack Obama's slogan “Yes We Can.” The Obama administration successfully met some aspirations and failed with others. The Trump administration? Time will tell. It looks like big chunks of the Trump coalition were looking for dramatic change, just as Bernie Sanders supporters were doing. The status quo simply wasn't tenable, not for people who'd grown up in the middle class, thanks to good-paying manufacturing jobs for their parents. Many of those jobs went away, across the border or overseas, leaving Mom and Dad working at Walmart or McDonald's and the kids struggling with college debt or camped out in the basement working minimum-wage jobs. There was tremendous anger at the establishment that allowed or encouraged the exodus of jobs in the name of free trade and globalization. Republicans were basically cheerleaders of the exodus because it made CEOs and investors richer. Democrats, those who weren't enablers of the exodus in the name of free trade, were ineffectual at stopping or even slowing the exodus of jobs. Retraining for guys who used to make $80,000 a year working the lines in Detroit, just so they could maybe make $30,000 a year in a service industry, just doesn't cut it. Then there was the role of retail giant Walmart, which not only destroyed Mom 'n Pop retail businesses on Main Street but also forced manufacturers to move factories to low-wage countries. (See Rubber Maid's well-documented experience with Walmart.) Reagan's assault on unions broke the link between ever-greater labor productivity with ever-better pay. NAFTA helped shatter the American Dream for millions. I suppose that if I could project my hopes onto MAGA, I'd opt for the Eisenhower era, when we had a booming and prosperous economy dominated by manufacturing. We built the inter-state, schools and suburbia for blue-collar families that enjoyed a social contract with owners/managers — I'll work hard and you'll provide a job for life and real hope for my kids. (Of course, all that was predicated on strong unions that had fought and bled for that prosperity, and a 92 percent highest tax rate on the 1 percent that paid off the costs incurred from the Great Depression and World War II. It was also predicated on the fact that the industrial world, save the US, was just emerging from the ruins of that war.) Did you know that right now, there's a prosperous, Western, liberal, capitalist country that has a robust economy dominated by manufacturing, one that has never shipped jobs and factories overseas? Germany copied our best management practices after the war. Labor unions are strong and work closely with management/owners. Germany enjoys trade surpluses with the rest of the world. Jobs are kept at home and immigration provides a labor supply as birth rates decline. As a result, blue-collar Germans enjoy excellent pay and benefits and virtually lifelong employment. German factories are opened overseas, not to replace shuttered factories at home but to expand market share abroad. And German CEOs don't make 300 to 400 times what a worker on the line makes. More like 30 times, so Germany doesn't have a 1 percent that dominates politics with campaign contributions, like our own Koch brothers. So why can't we be more like Germany? What do you want MAGA to mean?

MAGA is just a slogan Trumpy used to rile up the gullible. The world is moving forward. Technology is moving so fast that workers can't keep up with the jobs needed. In the words of the Prophet: "Them steady jobs are goin' forth and they ain't comin' back". Back to the 50s? Are you kidding? Upvote 1 Post reply Please Login and/or Verify your account to reply Sign in to suggest removal John Weibel 23 hours, 55 minutes ago Well, maybe looking at our tax structure, which is based on employment, not production. Maybe, as opposed to taxing labor, we restructure how the system works and tax goods sold. That way, products are not made to be disposable, taxes on goods sold does not replace the displacement of labor in favor of technology and many other things the fair tax would help solve, versus the current system that really works against human labor being employed in this country - in favor of technology or outsourcing. Upvote 0 Post reply Please Login and/or Verify your account to reply Sign in to suggest removal Scott Wedel 18 hours, 53 minutes ago John, If you change to taxing goods sold and not labor then that gives an even bigger advantage to large vertically integrated companies that can take raw materials into finished products. Small parts manufacturers then face taxes trying to supply another manufacturer. It makes more sense to tax labor as the job exists and the labor is being paid because something useful is being done. Otherwise, trying to tax the "goods" of knowledge jobs becomes arbitrary. The 50s were great for the US because most of the world's major economies were rebuilding what had been destroyed. That isn't going to happen again. With Obama in Peru there are articles on trade and the future of trade agreements with the USA. There is a certain level of "it doesn't matter" in Peru because they will export to China or whomever is willing to sign a bilateral trade deal. USA won't have additional jobs if we don't import artichokes grown in the opposite season as in the USA. What Germany has been doing well is connecting their education system to companies so that students are trained for the available jobs. USA has all sorts of openings for various skilled jobs, but lacks the qualified people to take those jobs. We have a trillion dollars in student debt and yet a shortage college graduates qualified to fill good paying skilled jobs.

New figures released show that foot traffic to branches is also down, with "branch banker interactions" down 22 percent from 2015. The figures come in the wake of a sales practice scandal that triggered multiple lawsuits, an enormous $185 million fine and the resignation of the company's longtime CEO John Stumpf.

Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 68.54 -0.65 -0.94% SPX Corp SPXC ▲ 23.20 +0.29 +1.27% “For holiday and fourth quarter, we expect Walmart to continue to excel on multiple fronts, particularly online where we expect sales to continue to accelerate on a percentage basis, with a growth rate approaching 30% likely as it leverages its store network to handle online orders, especially via its buy online/pick-up in-store capability, as well as increasing benefits from Jet.com,” said Charlie O’Shea, lead retail analyst at Moody’s. Wal-Mart (WMT) reported a 20.6% increase in global e-commerce sales on a constant-currency basis for the third quarter. Moody’s puts Wal-Mart’s online sales growth on a base of $14 billion to $15 billion, without a full quarter of Jet.com results. Total revenue for the third quarter was $118.2 billion, up from $117.4 billion last year, but falling short of the FactSet consensus of $118.6 billion. Earnings per share were 98 cents, down from $1.03 last year, but ahead of the 96-cent FactSet estimate. =Wal-Mart added eight million SKUs (stock keeping units) to the website over the past three months, Chief Executive Doug McMillion said Thursday in his prepared remarks. And e-commerce added 50 basis points to the retailer’s third-quarter U.S. same-store sales figure, “which is our largest contribution yet,” he added. Walmart U.S. same-store sales increased 1.2% in the third quarter, driven by a 0.7% traffic increase, Wal-Mart said. Wal-Mart announced a strategic alliance with Chinese e-commerce company JD.com this summer, that included the sale of its Yihaodian website to JD.com. See also: Wal-Mart’s deal with China’s JD.com may be copied by others The partners announced that they were launching three new initiatives in late October. Wal-Mart has also invested in New Dada, a Chinese on-demand logistics and grocery e-commerce platform, McMillon said in his remarks. New Dada is making two-hour delivery service from 45 Walmart locations possible. Wal-Mart announced that it was acquiring Jet.com for $3 billion in August. Jet.com founder Marc Lore took over Wal-Mart’s e-commerce operations earlier this month.  Neil Saunders, chief executive of retail research agency and consulting firm Conlumino, believes Wal-Mart’s U.S. online growth “is now well above the overall market,” which indicates they’re adding share. But there are other factors playing a role in the result. “The figures include half a quarter of sales from recently acquired Jet.com, which flatters the results somewhat,” said Saunders in a note published Thursday. “Nonetheless, we believe that Walmart is now on much more positive trajectory in terms of both its e-commerce strategy and results.” Walmart's Strategy on Food Safety and Affordability Frank Yiannas, vice president of Food Safety at Walmart Stores, discusses the strategy for reducing risk and providing consumers with safe, affordable foods at America's largest grocery chain. He spoke with WSJ's Sarah Nassauer at the WSJ Global Food Forum in New York.  “We view the same-store sales growth as evidence that Wal-Mart’s investment in labor, e-commerce and marketing its value message are working,” said The Buckingham Research Group in a note published Thursday. “However, some investors may be disappointed that traffic and comps decelerated slightly from fiscal second-quarter 2016.” Wal-Mart highlighted food deflation, weather and currency impacts among the headwinds.

Construction of the new 154,400 SF store is under the supervision of one of the most prolific and respected construction firms on the West Coast. Deacon Corp started in a tiny, borrowed office space in a small office building in southwest Portland in 1981. Steve Deacon and his wife were the company along with three friends. Since those early days Deacon Corp has grown to employ about 400 people who work out of offices in Seattle, Portland, Sacramento, Pleasanton and Irvine. According to the company website there is no headquarters and little in the way of hierarchy. The management structure seems to be working very well as Deacon has developed some iconic retail outlets over the years. Their project portfolio includes Portland’s flagship IKEA store, Cascade Plaza just off Airport Way at PDX, Seattle Premium Outlets in Marysville, 200 Target stores along the West coast, REI stores and The Woodburn Outlet Mall, just to name a few. In 2013 Deacon was named the #1 retail contractors in California and that same year the Woodburn Outlet Mall honored Deacon with an outstanding service award. In the industry they are noted for being able to smoothly coordinate multiple sub-contractors to successfully complete projects from small to very large. As for the Warrenton project, there was a quiet groundbreaking held last week and crews started to work on site development. By Friday morning Deacon signs were posted and a large construction trailer appeared on the site. The beginnings of an access road was taking shape and containment systems and been installed along the Highway frontage. The detailed drawings of the project indicate the store will have a grocery section with a bakery and deli. Plans also call for a garden supply shop, pharmacy, vision center and a tire and car battery section. All this is according to the bid plans for the project. ©2016 Ohana Media Group EEOC

Square Blossoms Water Authority West Rock Trails Westville Renaissance Westville Synagogue What Now New Haven Workforce Alliance Yale Events YMCA Youth Continuum Three Peels For The Bus Driver! by Shari Hoffman | Nov 19, 2016 5:44 pm Post a Comment | E-mail the Author Posted to: Opinion, Transportation, The Heights, CT Bus Diaries, True Vote From about 5 p.m. on I was waiting at the New Haven Walmart for the bus to come. A bunch of us waiting were from Bella Vista. The driver was nearly 20 minutes late, and it was getting cold. That was the beginning of an adventure early Sunday evening. One gal waiting was becoming impatient. She was tempted, as I have been in the past, to get on a bus that goes to Universal Drive first before it comes back to Bella Vista (the D14 bus). We persuaded her to wait since this would have taken longer to get home. Finally our D5 came. We got on. One person was still waiting to get on; he was confined to a wheelchair. I didn’t know him. Some of the women I got on with were chatting away. I could hear one talking about the uses of banana peels. I wasn’t sitting close enough, so all I heard her say was that she got rid of a wart with banana peels.  I didn’t know what to think of that. All I could think about was wanting to get home after standing outside in the cold and the dark. Eventually I realized that the bus driver was on his phone for quite some time having a very serious conversation with CT Transit. We were not going anywhere. A man in a wheelchair was waiting to get on the bus. The doors to the bus were open, and we were still cold because of it. Eventually the bus driver got off the bus and stood outside with his hands in his pockets, not saying anything to any of us. All we knew was that we were not going anywhere, and we didn’t know why. Then I saw him on his cell phone. Frustrated, wanting to know what was happening, I got off the bus to find out. I waited until he hung up his cell and then walked over to him and asked him why we were not going anywhere. He said, “I heard a passenger say they have ‘ebola’ and we can’t go anywhere until this is taken care of.” “No one has ebola,” I said. “A woman was talking about banana peels.” “Ohhhhhhh,” he said “I thought someone was ill.” He looked confused and then said again he thought someone was ill. I reiterated that the woman was talking about helpful uses for banana peels and that no one had ebola. “Forget about this,” he said, still looking serious and a bit embarrassed. I got back on the bus, and everyone wanted to know what he said. “It’s not worth repeating,” I said. That made everyone push me to tell what transpired , so I said without using the name of the illness, “The bus driver thought he heard someone say they were sick, and that‘s why we‘re not going anywhere.” Now the passengers were more confused and asked for more information. Eventually I told them the full story. Everyone was laughing. Some decided that the driver was a germaphobe and crazy. We still had to wait for the bus driver’s supervisor to come. After she arrived, the two of them chatted for quite some time. Inside the bus and watching them, I once again wondered why it was still taking so long. So again I got off the bus and approached the two of them. The supervisor looked like a nice gal; none of this was her doing. I smiled at her. She smiled back. I started to ask if we could get going. As the words were on the tip of my tongue, they ended their conversation and started helping the man in the wheelchair onto the bus, which took another five minutes. This whole event must have taken about 45 minutes; plus, the bus was running 20 minutes late to start with. I finally got home with my banana-peel-informed neighbor from Bella Vista. As we got off the bus we were laughing about the whole circumstance but were mainly glad to be home. She told me that banana peel can even whiten your teeth.  I’ve never known a dentist to share this information, nor did I ever see banana peels advertised on TV as a teeth whitener. I had to Google it — and sure enough I found it! My neighbor was right — one can even shine their shoes with banana peels! I called the bus company Monday hoping for a report from the previous evening’s events. The operator I spoke with checked and said that there wasn’t any kind of information pertinent to the event I experienced. I asked her if it is typical that a report is filed when a supervisor has to come out. No there is not, she said. There is a report filed only when there is a complaint. I wish I had filed a complaint, because this was purely nutty and it held up a lot of people on a Sunday evening. Monday Evening’s Ride   At the end of the next day, Monday, I was waiting for a D bus at the stop on Chapel Street right after Foot Locker going toward Fair Haven. I get on at Chapel and State. I got in a D13 bus at the corner of Chapel and State (opposite Elm City Market) around 5:30 p.m.. The bus was packed. As I put my ticket in the fare box, I heard someone say the word “doo.” Then I saw people pointing to a completely empty seat.“You can’t sit there,” one said. “Someone went to the bathroom on the seat.” As I moved farther into the bus I smelled the “doo.” Some folks were holding their noses. It was gross. (I didn’t see any “doo,” though.) I didn’t know where I was going to sit. Then a kind woman motioned for me to sit on the inside of her seat. She was holding a spray bottle of cleaner and paper towels. How she knew to come prepared, I don’t know. I asked her what happened. She said someone had an accident on the seat … which I could smell, yet when I looked over at the seat there wasn‘t anything there except the smell that told the story. The windows of the bus were open. As we rode along, fresh air eventually cleared the smell out. When the gal with the paper towels next to me got off the bus, a young man from the back came over and sat down. I asked him if he knew what happened but he really didn’t know, either. He surmised that someone had an accident and got off the bus right afterwards. As I exited the bus, I tried one last time. I asked the driver if she knew what happened.  She looked weary and shook her head. Shari Hoffman lives at Bella Vista and regularly rides CT Transit buses.

Have no fear. We've put together a list for you.

(Photo: Michael Zamora/The Register)Buy Photo Eager to put the election behind them, consumers are expected to spend with enthusiasm this holiday shopping season, with retailers expecting Thanksgiving and Black Friday sales to outpace previous years. "Influence from the election was a distraction," said Marshal Cohen, a retail analyst with New York-based NPD Group. "But now we see that half the country is happy and ready to get back to spending, while the other half is sad and in need of some retail therapy." Consumers are expected to spend an average of $935.58 each during the holiday shopping season, including $588.90 on gifts and $207.07 for items such as food, decorations, flowers and greeting cards, according to a National Retail Federation survey. They will spend the remaining $139.61 on themselves, the survey showed. Shoppers insistent on getting the best bargains will be out in force on Black Friday, said C. Britt Beemer, chairman of the consumer behavior marketing company America's Research Group. DES MOINES REGISTER Mall of America to close on Thanksgiving. Are Iowa malls next? In a recent telephone survey, Beemer found that 40 percent of people said they would be shopping on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, especially if there are door-buster deals and deep discounts advertised. Most people believe that “the only time to get the super deals is on the Black Friday holiday weekend,” he said. Shoppers already have been previewing Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday advertisements that have been published or leaked online. But most will pore over newspaper ads that come out the day before Thanksgiving, Beemer said. Overall, retail sales are expected to be up 2.5 percent this holiday season over last, Beemer predicted. Discount retailers likely will be the winners of the season, said Cohen. "Mass merchants like Target and Wal-Mart are in the right position because of their value, full assortment and early and aggressive promotions. Department stores are the most vulnerable," he said.

USA TODAY NETWORK Here's what else you can expect for the holiday shopping season: Online shopping growing Perhaps eager to avoid the crowds, more shoppers are opting to buy their holiday gifts and other items online. For the first time, online spending will equal in-store shopping, according to the Deloitte Consulting holiday shopping survey. Two-thirds of shoppers said they will research items online and then buy them in a store, according to the Deloitte survey. About half said they planned to check out items in the stores and then shop for better prices online. Smartphones are helping people shop in greater numbers. Survey respondents said they will use their smartphones to locate stores, compare prices, read reviews, browse for items, get coupons, check for availability and make purchases, according to Deloitte. DES MOINES REGISTER Deals and duds in the search for Black Friday savings Filling out the ranks Retailers traditionally pump up their employment ranks during the holiday shopping season to handle the shopping onslaught. This year, companies such as Target, Kohl’s, Younkers and others are hiring about the same number of extra workers as last year. Delivery and mail-order companies such as United Parcel Service and Amazon are adding more jobs this season to help with increased online shopping. "The sector with the biggest increase in holiday hiring in recent years has been transportation and warehousing, as more and more holiday shopping is done online," John Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. And while companies such as Target and BonTon Stores Inc. (parent company of Younkers) have held steady with their number of holiday workers in stores this year, they are adding more help in their distribution centers, Challenger said.

Comb the ads and circulars for the best deals. Don’t forget online retailers, who also advertise deals. Here are some more tips from Consumer Reports: Shoppers can do comparison shopping on sites such as FatWallet, PriceGrabber.com, PriceWatch.com, Shopping.com, Google Shopping and NexTag.com. Retailers sometimes will have unique model numbers or product names, making direct price comparisons difficult. Retailers' loyalty programs can offer sales, coupons and discounts to members. Also, remember to check retailers’ social media sites, including Facebook and Twitter, to get notices of deals. Avoid overspending by creating a budget and sticking to it. Curb impulse buys and use cash to avoid credit cards. Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share The online retailer plans to add deals every five minutes from now until December 22nd.

More than half of all consumers say at least some of the presents they plan to give this year will be gift cards, according to a survey from Bankrate, a consumer finance website. But only 27 percent of those surveyed preferred receiving a gift card over an actual gift at the holidays, according to Bankrate. The Iowa Attorney General's Office offers some tips on buying and using gift cards: Gift cards cannot expire for at least five years after the card purchase date, or from the last date a consumer added additional funds onto the card. The expiration date must be clearly disclosed on the card. The merchant or institution offering the card cannot charge inactivity fees until the card has not been used for at least a year, and can charge only one fee per month. All fees must be clearly disclosed on the package. Be wary of purchasing gift cards from online auction sites, because the cards may have been used or may be fraudulent. 8 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/2g5Bg7J

(Seeking Alpha) Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) reported Q3 results before market open on Thursday, and the shares ticked lower over the trading day. Rating And Price Target Looking past the retail giant’s mixed results and soft guidance, Baird Equity Research analyst Peter S. Benedict maintained both his Outperform rating for the retail giant and his $80 price target. Justification The analyst cited the following as key reasons behind his maintained rating: Tightly controlled inventory. An EPS in line with estimates. Accelerated e-commerce sales. “Respectable” comparables performance. Outlook. Wal-Mart saw global e-commerce sales up 20.6 percent, compared with Q2’s 11.8 percent increase and an “even stronger growth” in the United States, according to Benedict. “When combined with WMT's defensive appeal within a still choppy consumer/retail backdrop, we remain Outperform-rated,” said Benedict. At time of writing, Wal-Mart shares were trading at $68.72.

For years, retailers have rolled out huge sales (and pre-Black Friday deals) in honour of the day after Americans celebrate their Thanksgiving. The tradition began in the United States, according to Snopes, because retailers wanted to capture the millions of consumers who get the day off (hello, holiday shopping!).

"Following" : "Follow"}} November 18, 2016 8:34am   Comments Share: Related WMT Wal-Mart Remains Barclays' Top Pick Despite Mixed Results Wal-Mart's Soft Q4 Guidance Doesn't Rock Baird Analyst's Positive View Buffett Sold Most Of His Wal-Mart, Should You? (Seeking Alpha) Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) reported an earnings beat for its fiscal third quarter of 2017. Although comps narrowly missed expectations, they “may have beat had it not been for unusually warm weather which hurt apparel and other sales,” Barclays’ Karen Short said in a report. She maintains an Overweight rating on the company, with a price target of $82. Wal-Mart reported its quarterly EPS at $0.98, versus Barclays’ estimate of $0.97. EPS benefited from a one-off gain and a lower tax rate. Short reduced the EPS estimates for Q4 and FY 2017 from $1.18 to $1.25 and from $4.33 to $4.27, respectively, citing lower comps and operating margin at Wal-Mart U.S., weaker international revenue and higher expenses. 5 Positives And 4 Negatives Short highlighted the positives from the quarter: Steady traffic growth at Wal-Mart U.S. A larger basket size driven by Fresh. A 32bps gross margin expansion at Wal-Mart U.S., despite tough comps and price investment. Accelerated in e-commerce GMV growth to 28.6 percent year-over-year. A 6 percent decline in Wal-Mart U.S. comp store inventory. The analyst's negatives: An expected slowdown in Wal-Mart U.S. comps in Q4. A 130bps rise in SG&A rate at Wal-Mart U.S. Weaker-than-expected operating income at Sam's Club. International segment facing continued currency headwinds. In Friday's pre-market session, Wal-Mart was up 0.13 percent at $69.28.

The National Retail Federation expects consumers to spend an average of $935.58 over the holidays this year, including gifts for others, self-gifting, food, flowers, decorations and greeting cards for Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa. That's second only to last year's all-time NRF record of $952.58. (Marvin Fong, Plain Dealer file) Print Email Janet H. Cho, The Plain Dealer By Janet H. Cho, The Plain Dealer The Plain Dealer Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 18, 2016 at 8:36 AM, updated November 18, 2016 at 9:34 AM comments CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Retailers have spent months preparing for the coming week of shopping from Thanksgiving through Black Friday and Small Business Saturday, hoping that their clever promotions and carefully selected merchandise will be just the thing to draw eager shoppers into their stores and ready to spend. Some are hoping that consumers who were anxious about the presidential election will welcome the invitation to brighten other people's holidays with some retail therapy, and strengthen the economy heading into the new year. Q. Is Black Friday really the busiest shopping day of the year? A. Not always, but this year, it very well might be. ShopperTrak, the Chicago-based technology company that tracks foot traffic, buying patterns, and transaction size, says the top three shopping days for 2016 will be: Black Friday (Nov. 25), the Monday right after Christmas (Dec. 26), and the Friday before Christmas Eve (Dec. 23). "This year, we are dubbing Dec. 17 'Super Saturday' because we expect it to be the busiest Saturday of December," said Brian Field, ShopperTrak's senior director of advisory services, in a statement. "However, it will be no match for Black Friday, which will be the busiest shopping day of the holiday season."  ShopperTrak says Dec. 17 will be the fourth busiest shopping day of the year. On the other hand, Foursquare, which tracks more than 50 million mobile users a month as they trek to malls, boutiques and big-box stores, says Black Friday as a whole has been losing steam for years as people spread out their shopping over the entire holiday season. Foursquare expects Black Friday foot traffic will be down 3.5 percent from last year. Q. Why is it even called "Black Friday"? A. Traditionally, the Friday after Thanksgiving marked the beginning of the holiday shopping season, as well as when retailers that had been operating "in the red" started raking in profits, or running "in the black." Now, with mass merchandizers like Walmart announcing their lists of the hottest holiday toys as early as Sept. 1, the Christmas shopping season starts a lot earlier than it used to. After Walmart, rival Toys 'R' Us came out with its own #TRUhottoylist on Sept. 8. And while many retailers do make 25 percent to 45 percent of their annual sales in the final quarter, which includes Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa, if they actually had to wait until the end of November to become profitable, most of them wouldn't be able to stay open the rest of the year. Q. So why are so many stores opening their doors on Thanksgiving? A. Because Black Friday shoppers with fat wallets and long shopping lists tend to spend the most money at the first store they hit, retailers all compete to become that first stop, by opening their doors earlier and earlier.  In 2008, Kohl's and JCPenney opened at 4 a.m. to get a jump on the stores that opened at 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. By 2013, many stores were open at 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving, and this year, JCPenney is opening at 3 p.m. Thanksgiving Day.  ShopperTrak and other retail observers are skeptical that opening on Thanksgiving is worth the cost of opening that day. The Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, the nation's largest shopping center with more than 520 stores and restaurants, made headlines when it announced on Oct. 5 that it would stay closed this Thanksgiving. "Based on our findings, it's clear that Thanksgiving Day openings may risk more in operating costs than in expanding sales opportunities," Field. "Not to mention, opening on Thanksgiving has serious implications on staff morale." Locally, both Beachwood Place Mall and Ohio Station Outlets in Lodi are staying closed for Thanksgiving, although individual stores might open early. Q. But are the deals really worth camping out for? A. Depends on what you think of what's being offered. Retailers try to tempt early shoppers by offering them the biggest discounts on limited quantity big-ticket items, such as appliances, jewelry and flat-screen TVs, and by giving extra goodies to the first ones in line. NerdWallet, a personal finance website out of San Francisco, said that when it compared the promotions from Black Friday 2016 to 2015, it found that many major retailers like JCPenney, Best Buy, and Kohl's do offer lower prices on Thanksgiving and Black Friday than they do the rest of the holiday season.  On the other hand, NerdWallet said, it noticed that at least 32 retailers are repeating at least one Black Friday deal from 2015. Ohio Station Outlets in Lodi is giving the first 200 shoppers at its guest services office at 6 a.m. on Black Friday a $15 gift certificate redeemable at any outlet store. Plus, it is giving away Roku Express streaming media players to the first 100 shoppers with $275 or more in same-day receipts. Q. What kinds of stores do well on Black Friday? A. Foursquare says online and in-store promotions, warmer-than-usual temperatures, and how people feel about the election all factor into shopping decisions, but it expects the number of shoppers hitting big-box stores to increase 5 percent this year. Columbus-based "Big Lots will see the largest spike in the big-box category on Black Friday 2016, and Dollar Tree will be the leaders for the discount category -- with gains that will be even more pronounced closer to Christmas," Foursquare said in a written announcement. Among department stores, it predicts Marshall's, Dillard's and Macy's will see the largest increase in foot traffic. Q. What about Small Business Saturday? A. Mass merchandisers and discount stores with large advertising budgets do have an edge over small retailers on Black Friday, but American Express and local businesses are hoping consumers will still eat and shop locally on Small Business Saturday and beyond. The Merchants of Hudson, which includes more than 90 shops and restaurants, is holding a Celebration of Lights and Caroling from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Black Friday. And the nonprofit Ten Thousand Villages in Cleveland Heights, which sells fair-trade crafts and gifts made by artisans in developing countries, is welcoming a cash mob of local shoppers who have pledged to spend at least $20 each, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Nov. 19. Q. What are retailers expecting this holiday shopping season? A. Retailers are always optimistic about holiday spending. The National Retail Federation expects consumers to spend an average of $935.58 over the holidays, according to surveys conducted by Prosper Insights. That amount, which includes gifts for others, self-gifting, food, flowers, decorations and greeting cards for Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa, is second only to last year's all-time NRF record of $952.58. NRF says holiday spending over November and December is supposed to increase 3.6 percent to $655.8 billion. That includes a 7 percent to 10 percent spike in online sales, up to $117 billion. Some retail experts said uncertainty about the presidential election was making consumers more cautious, but it's unclear if the prospect of President-Elect Donald Trump will make people spend more or less this December. Perhaps that's why nearly six in 10 shoppers NRF surveyed said they were planning to splurge on themselves, spending an average of $139.61 on self indulgences, 4 percent more than last year.

Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen emphasized that the Fed plans to raise interest rates, which will help banks make more money from lending. Stocks started the day with small gains and moved higher following Yellen's testimony to Congress. Banks once again marched higher as investors cheered the latest indication that interest rates will rise from their current ultra-low levels. Retailers also rose after strong earnings from Best Buy, while food and household goods makers struggled after weak results from Wal-Mart and J.M. Smucker. Almost all of the S&P 500's gains since the presidential election have gone to financial stocks. They lagged the market for much of this year, but they're now trading at their highest levels since May 2008, months before the financial crisis peaked. Investors hope banks will benefit from higher interest rates, faster economic growth and lighter regulation under President-elect Trump. "I wouldn't expect we're going to see the entire repeal of Dodd-Frank, but we could certainly see some changes that are positive for the financial services sector," said Kate Warne, an investment strategist for Edward Jones. The Dow Jones industrial average added 35.68 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,903.82. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 10.18 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,187.12. The Nasdaq composite added 39.39 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,333.97. The Dow has set several records since the election, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are close to records they set a few months ago. Fed Chair Yellen told Congress that the economy is improving and added that that if the Fed keeps waiting now and raises rates too quickly later, that increases the risk of a recession. Investors already expected the Fed to raise interest rates when it meets in mid-December, and they felt Yellen's comments confirmed that higher rates are coming. Bond prices slipped. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 2.29 percent from 2.22 percent. Bond yields rise when investors expect higher interest rates and inflation. Bank of America gained 33 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $20.08 and PNC Financial Services climbed $3.09, or 2.9 percent, to $110.60. Greater sales of mobile phones and increased online sales helped electronics retailer Best Buy post a strong third quarter, and the company forecast a larger fourth-quarter profit than analysts had expected. Its stock climbed $5.54, or 13.7 percent, to $45.99 and hit a six-year high. Other retailers also rose. Home Depot recovered some recent losses and added $3.60, or 2.9 percent, to $128.93. Amazon also gained ground as Wal-Mart struggled. It picked up $9.91, or 1.3 percent, to $756.40. "Instead of spending in traditional ways, consumers have decided to spend their additional dollars in technology and online shopping," Warne said. Wal-Mart announced disappointing sales in its third quarter. The retailer's profit also fell as it invested more money in its stores and its online business. The stock lost $2.20, or 3.1 percent, to $69.19 Warehouse club operator Costco and grocery store chain Kroger both took small losses as well. Jam and jellies maker J.M. Smucker disclosed weak sales and its stock shed $5.10, or 3.9 percent, to $124.85. Tyson Foods fell $2.32, or 3.4 percent, to $66.70. Cisco Systems fell after its earnings forecast disappointed Wall Street. The seller of routers, switches, software and services forecast a smaller-than-expected profit for its second fiscal quarter. That canceled out a strong first-quarter report. The stock gave up $1.52, or 4.8 percent, to $30.05. Oil refining company Tesoro will buy Western Refining for $37.30 a share in stock, a deal the companies valued at $4.1 billion. The stock closed at $30.50 on Wednesday, and it jumped $7.05, or 23.1 percent, to $37.55. Tesoro shares rose 82 cents, or 1 percent, to $86.56. Higher interest rates also mean a stronger dollar. The dollar climbed to 109.89 yen from 109.15 yen. The euro fell to $1.0626 from $1.0681. The ICE U.S. dollar index continued to rise. It's at its highest level in 13 years. Benchmark U.S. crude slid 15 cents to $45.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slipped 14 cents to $46.49 a barrel in London. Energy companies lagged the market after big gains earlier this week.

Ross Aynami, 32, of Chicago was ordered held on $60,000 bail Thursday. Prosecutors say he was captured on video at other Wal-Mart stores using gift cards he fraudulently obtained through information he acquired from neighbors. According to Cook County Assistant State's Attorney Maureen McGee, Aynami used the information to obtain gift cards, which he then sold to a Chicago currency exchange in exchange for money orders payable to him and his wife. Aynami used the stolen information to make 35 transactions totaling about $13,000, McGee said. At his home, Mount Prospect police recovered hundreds of gift cards whose balances totaled $9,200, McGee said. Police also recovered a credit card reader, blank credit cards and phony driver's licenses, she said. Aynami next appears in court on Dec. 9.

(Okanagan Gleaners/Facebook) Related Stories 'Justice for blemished fruit': How some B.C. companies are fighting global food waste Rebel Soup enrolls in B.C.'s battle against food waste 6 foods with unexpected health benefits Walmart insider says 'heartbreaking' amount of food dumped in trash How Canada sucks at reducing food waste Food waste has been declared a global challenge by the United Nations, and over the past year, some B.C. entrepreneurs have stepped up to make use of second-grade produce that often ends up in landfills. 'Justice for blemished fruit': How some B.C. companies are fighting global food waste But for Oliver's Greg Masson, finding a home for blemished fruits and veggies is nothing new. In fact, his organization Okanagan Gleaners has been doing it for 20 years — and fighting world hunger in the process. The organization collects excess fruits and vegetables that would otherwise end up in a landfill due to aesthetic issues that keep them from making it to supermarket shelves. The team dehydrates them, turns them into dry vegetable soup mix and ships them to different charities around the world. "When we started in 1996, we were able to produce 100,000 servings of soup," Masson told host Sheryl MacKay on CBC's North by Northwest. "In 2016, we were able to provide 6.8 million servings of soup." Masson says when a large group of volunteers are at it, production can look a bit like organized chaos. (Okanagan Gleaners/Facebook) In the last year alone, Okanagan Gleaners has fed people in Ethiopia, Guatemala, Ukraine, Fiji, Swaziland and Lesotho. The small non-profit society works directly with local farmers, who donate fruits and veggies that aren't appealing to common consumers even though there's really nothing wrong with the products. Food waste costs Canada $31B a year, report says Walmart insider says 'heartbreaking' amount of food dumped in trash "The abundance of produce that the farmers are donating to us — what they donate to us is produce that is either too big for market, too small, too ripe or not ripe enough. It could be a green pepper that's got red and yellow on it," said Masson. "We've had some onions that are beach ball sizes — people won't buy them that big," said Masson.  Masson says the group couldn't operate without the generosity of the farmers and the large pool of volunteers who try to make it whenever they can. In the latest year of production, the team at Okanagan Gleaners made 6.8 million servings of soup. (Okanagan Gleaners/Facebook) "We had a low of nine a day, and we had a high of 70. We have no idea how many people are going to help us out on any given day," he said. He admits that when there's a crowd of volunteers, production can be a bit chaotic — but they're all there with the same goal: to help someone in need. "We will never know who that person is," he said. "But nutrition is just so key in North America that it's time that some of these other countries were able to obtain the same nutrition, and that's what we're doing."

Nov 2016, 18:55 MEZ - Deutsche Märkte geschlossen An unlikely type of store is expected to defy the curse plaguing retail and crush Black FridayVon Kate Taylor | Business Insider – vor 18 Stunden Freigeben 0 Twittern 0 Share0 Drucken (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Black Friday has certainly lost some of its luster. This year it may even lose its title as the biggest shopping day of the year.  But one type of retailer is predicted to thrive this Thanksgiving week: dollar stores.  According to data from location tracking company Foursquare, discount stores, such as dollar stores, are gaining in foot traffic this year as Black Friday approaches. While most retailers are expecting a slump in foot traffic, Foursquare predicts that the number of visits to dollar stores this year will exceed the last two years.  Typically, discount stores don't experience the Black Friday boost that retailers like Macy's and Walmart rely on to increase sales, according to Foursquare. Dollar stores and other similarly deeply-discounted retailers usually gain momentum later in the holiday season. (Foursquare) But this year, dollar stores are predicted to pull off a Black Friday win for two reasons. First, this year customers are less interested in traditional Black Friday sales. Second, more and more Americans are interested in deep-discount retailers year-round, a phenomenon that has helped fuel the growth of dollar stores across the county.  Foursquare data predicts that overall Black Friday Foot traffic will be down about 3.5% compared to last year — a decrease, but one that isn't as severe as the year-over-year drop from 2014 to 2015. Last year, Black Friday sales fell 12% to $10.2 billion compared to a year before, according to ShopperTrak. Looking at the entire four-day weekend, brick-and-mortar retail sales fell by 10.4%, to $20.4 billion last year. Black Friday's decline doesn't mean that people don't care about deals. They do. In fact, discount shoppers account for two-thirds of all customers, according to a July study by the industry research firm NPD Group. But shoppers have become accustomed to finding deals all year long, not just on Black Friday.  (Flickr / m01229) That has led to a growing appreciation for dollar stores and other deep-discount retail chains. While department stores like Macy's, Nordstrom, and Kohl's have struggled to convince shoppers to buy items at full price, dollar stores are attracting shoppers with their consistently super-low prices.  "The last 10 years have seen dramatic growth within value retail, including the rapid growth in dollar stores and also the arrival and expansion of limited assortment/deep discount retailers," Jordan Rost, the vice president of consumer insights at Nielsen, told Business Insider. "These stores are eating into the share of wallet for traditional, mainstream supermarkets and mass merchandisers, leading to contractions in that channel." The number of dollar stores in the US has grown by 45% in the last 10 years, reaching 28,048 locations in 2016, according to Nielsen data.  Dollar stores aren't just popular among lower-income bargain shoppers. Affluent millennials are shopping at the super-discount retailers more and more. The number of heads of households under 35 who earn more than $100,000 a year and shop at dollar stores rose 7.1% from 2012 to 2015.  The scope of what people are shopping for at dollar stores is also growing. From July 2015 to 2016, the number of customers who purchased meat or poultry from a dollar store in the previous three months more than doubled, from 3% to 7%.   NOW WATCH: Why McDonald's and Chipotle test new food concepts in Ohio More From Business Insider How Target, Walmart, and Amazon are facing the ultimate challenge on the biggest shopping days of the year Iowa restaurant sparks outrage for charging Trump voters higher prices 3 NBA teams are reportedly ditching Trump-branded hotels TRADING PLATFORM Jetzt handeln Leistungsstarke Handelsplattform von einem Marktführer.

Well, it was a Wednesday and that is when they gather to knit, so … while in Rome, as it were. It certainly wasn’t because the group’s leader, Martha Zetter is a taskmaster. Nope, Zetter started the club a year ago at the Troke Library because she figured there were like-minded knitters in the community who wanted to give back to the community. She was the sole member for the first few months but with a little promotion by Troke reference librarian Dennis Tucker, word started to spread. Cortland was the first to join. Then Jennifer Carpenter arrived, and she brought along her mom, Diane Fender. Those four founding members went to work and within a couple of months, knitted 44 hats, 142 scarves and two hat and scarf sets to donate to Helping Hands, the outreach ministry at Lakeview Assembly Church. Earlier this month, the group that now has 12 to 14 regular knitters and another dozen or so who show up when they can, kicked off the holiday giving season by sharing 454 hand-crafted items to seven organizations. Hats, scarves, lap blankets, dolls, bears and twiddlemuffs, which have sewn on items to busy the hands of dementia patients, went to the Stockton Police Department chaplaincy program, the Women’s Center, Dignity House, Camlu Assisted Living, San Joaquin County Hospital, Pride House and Helping Hands. “The only thing I can say to you is anybody can got out and buy hats or scarves from Wal-Mart, but when we give these away, they’re handmade. Somebody took the time with that individual on their heart,” said John Schwabauer, who with his wife, Rose, runs Helping Hands. “That’s more than a hat. We really do appreciate this. These are going to go quickly.” When Zetter first retired 26 years ago from a career as a nurse — she said she’s retired three times since — she wanted to keep people in Stockton warm. She never knew how great the need really was until she began knitting. Her husband of 57 years, Joe, encourages her to pursue her love and doesn’t mind, she said, when he has to move boxes of yarn or projects in the works or completed items when he vacuums their north Stockton home. Zetter went beyond her plan to knit for others, though. She stated the group at the library, where she encourages them and teaches the craft to beginners. Some of the yarn and other materials are donated. Others are supplied by the knitters “The emphasis is on cheerful colors and our talent for using different patterns that stretch our skill levels,” Zetter said. Watching beginners become confident knitters is her greatest satisfaction, Zetter said, along with establishing new friendships. The reward though, is helping the community. The Women’s Center will use its gifts for residents of Dawn House, a safe place for women and their children who flee domestic violence, sometimes with nothing but the clothes on their backs, said the agency’s Jennifer Jones. The chaplaincy program will use the dolls and bears in giveaways to children in hospitals and Haven of Peace. And Helping Hands, which took the biggest number of items, will help the people they find throughout Stockton who need a little warmth. As the temperatures begin diving at night, as home furnaces get their first use of the fall, it’s hard not to think about how a warm hat, scarf or blanket could help someone out on the streets or in a shelter or sleeping in a car. Fortunately, the group of knitters at Troke didn’t need a cold night to think about the less fortunate. They’ve been thinking of them all year, lovingly crafting, as Jones called the pieces of art, with pieces of their heart. — Contact reporter Lori Gilbert at (209) 546-8284 or lgilbert@recordnet.com.

Election lessons learned Letter: Republicans must right the ship Mary Kemen Nov 19, 2016 at 12:01 am | Print View The greatest tragedy in our national election is the bare wound it exposed in our collective. Millions were abandoned over recent decades by jobs sent overseas, low wages, lack of health care and a mortgage crisis. Each of us was responsible as we demanded lower prices, lower taxes, more dramatic medical care. When the largest employer in the United States (Wal-Mart) paid unliveable wages and offered no benefits, we knew this was wrong, yet we demanded Chinese goods at rock-bottom prices. The Republicans have an unprecedented mandate to right the ship. Paul Ryan speaks of privatizing Medicare; we need only look at Medicaid privatization in this state to predict a dire outcome. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to bring jobs back from abroad, though all products bearing his name are made in other countries. He wishes to create a military rivaling that of the Vietnam War, while massively cutting taxes and suggests that reducing other federal programs will balance this. Which are we personally willing to reduce — Social Security, Pell grants, the postal service? To those who voted for Trump, I sincerely wish you success in uniting our country and finding solutions to health care, education, employment and immigration problems. Nothing would please me more. But I will not be silent in the face of the darker forces you put in power, that degrade women, minorities, religions. It is my right and mandate to seek “liberty and justice for all.” Mary Kemen Cedar Rapids Your next Letters to the Editor articles Letter: Republicans must right the ship Letter: Save the historic Ely's Stone Br ...

What he didn’t know then was that little J would be the just the first of a brood of boys he would take in. He has since become the full-time caregiver of 10, ranging in age from 5 to 20. The boys arrived at his home for a variety of reasons and face various obstacles, including intellectual disabilities and mental health diagnoses. C is now up against his own health issues: Cancer he fought off eight years ago has returned, and he has started having seizures. This big-hearted dad could use help with medical bills, clothing and Walmart gift cards. CASE 20 • S, 29, and her six children became homeless after they left an abusive relationship, and now they live in transitional housing. Their only income is food stamps. S has entered a job-training program, but that’s tough to juggle because four of the children are under age 5. Some of the children are in counseling because of the trauma they endured, and the twins, who are 10 months old, are in and out of the hospital because they were born prematurely. S wants a stable environment for her family. She would like beds for herself and the kids, as well as dressers and a washer. She would love to make their holidays bright with toys this year. CASE 21 • Bedbugs and the lack of electricity haunt M, a grandmother of four who lost her daughter — the children’s mother — two years ago to blood clot. M, 58, recently bought several mattresses for her grandchildren at a secondhand store, only to find that they were infested with bedbugs. She has since had to throw out the beds, linens and more. When the restaurant she worked at part time caught fire, she was no longer able to pay for electricity nor gas. Her grandchildren are 16, twin 14-year-olds and 6. She asks for beds for her grandchildren and help paying her utility bills. Case profiles by Colleen Schrappen, Valerie Schremp Hahn and Ashley Jost of the Post-Dispatch. 100 Neediest Cases: More on the campaign Nov 3, 2014 (…) Read more cases and find opportunities to give. Tags 100 Neediest Cases United Way Neediest Cases Giving Grandchild Bedbug View (…) comments How to give For generations, the 100 Neediest Cases campaign has helped thousands of disadvantaged families during the holidays. The tradition dates to 1922, when civic leaders formed the Christmas Bureau. The Post-Dispatch has partnered with the program for more than five decades, renaming the campaign 100 Neediest Cases in 1954. Annual donations to the campaign swelled to $1.3 million last year from $400 in 1922. HOW IT WORKS • More than 70 social service agencies, working through the United Way, identify thousands of needy families. This year, nearly 12,400 cases were submitted. Volunteers then select 100 cases to be profiled in the newspaper to raise awareness and encourage donations for all the families. TWO WAYS TO GIVE ADOPT A CASE • For highest-need cases, the program supplies donors with a list of a family's needs. Donors are asked to meet at least one of the stated needs and provide at least one present for each child. Everything goes directly to the family, through a social worker. Last year more than 800 high-need cases were adopted. DONATE • Monetary gifts to the 100 Neediest Cases general fund are used to help the more than 10,000 cases, and go directly to the family. TO ADOPT A CASE OR DONATE • Call 314-421-6060 from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on weekdays, visit 100neediestcases.org, or mail a check (no cash) to P.O. Box 955925, St. Louis, Mo. 63195.

Most of the attacks were targeted against minority groups such as Muslims, African-Americans, women, members of the LGBT community, and so on. Only about a dozen were reported as “anti-Trump” attacks. “They’ve been everywhere — in schools, in places of business like Walmart, on the street,” Southern Poverty Law Center President Richard Cohen said of the report issued by the center on Friday. While the law center expressed concern over the hateful acts, they did also point to a “steady drop-off” in harassment, noting that 65% of the incidents had taken place in the three days after Election Day when the results were still fresh in everyone’s minds. — Video of black woman being berated by white pro-Trump boyfriend goes viral —  206 of the reported attacks were anti-immigrant in nature, topping the list, while at the bottom of the list were anti-Trump attacks, at 27. Anti-woman attacks were second lowest, at 36. Black people were targeted in 151 attacks, Muslims in 51, and LGBT people in 80. In 60 cases, swastikas were involved. The same day the report came out, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch released a video statement on rising hate crime statistics. “I know that many Americans are concerned,” Lynch said. “We need you to continue to report these incidents to local law enforcement as well as the justice department so that our career investigators and prosecutors can take action to defend your rights.” Related Posts Teacher pleads guilty to being impregnated by 13-year-old student Designer who dressed Michelle Obama refuses to ever work with Melania Trump White supremacists create fake ‘black person’ accounts to infiltrate Black Twitter Officer indicted after fatally shooting and beating unarmed black man Trump advisor proudly compares himself to Dick Cheney and Satan Autopsy reveals Marion Barry’s son died of PCP overdose Post navigation Previous Previous post: Michigan says delivering water to Flint residents is an ‘unnecessary’ burden Next Next post: ‘Make America Great Again’ billboard features Bloody Sunday image Get news in your inbox TheGrio Favorites Worst NFL players who won the Heisman Trophy 15 richest NBA players of all time The 25 Most Influential Black American Leaders of All Time The top 10 greatest black quarterbacks of all time Infamous celebrity mugshots 15 films that hurt black America The best and worst NBA number 1 draft picks of all time The 30 greatest black movie soundtracks of all time Michelle Obama's birthday!: 52 memorable moments to celebrate the first lady's 52nd year 15 gifts we don't want for Christmas Recent Health Stories Breast cancer kills more black women than white women Fentanyl pills found at Prince's estate are 50 times stronger than heroin Woman goes to emergency room after trying new lipstick Study: Some medical students think black people feel less pain than whites Kanye West represents the victimhood, paranoia plaguing black men Gov.

CLARK, NJ — The Skulski Art Gallery of the Polish Cultural Foundation in Clark hosted the opening of an art gallery titled, “Wood and Grain,” with reliefs by Jerzy Chojnowski and grain compositions by Majka Nowak on Sunday, Nov. 13. The work will be displayed until Dec. 2. The opening including a musical performance by Dorota Huculak, who sung poetry accompanied by the guitar. Majka Nowak is a painter, sculptor and stain-glass artist. She uses a very unique technique in her work which gives texture, and also a signature unlike any other. Nowak uses different grains to create her work. “I shop for things like bean and seeds in stores such as ShopRite and Walmart to make my pieces,” Nowak told LocalSource in an interview. One of Nowak’s most amazing works of art is her piece “Jezus” which is created using brown, black and white sesame seeds. The piece is amazing because it has a teardrop dripping from the eye, which appeared unexplainably. “The teardrop appeared three months after I completed the piece,” Nowak told LocalSource in an interview. “It’s really miraculous.” Religious influences were revealed in the artwork of both Nowak and Chojnowski. Nowak’s first piece, “Pope John Paul,” was a request made by a priest in Poland. It was her first work in grains. Another piece, “Pope Francis” was displayed but not for sale, as Nowak plans to give it to the Pope one day. The work is created with beans and seeds and stands four by five feet. Other pieces of hers include “Little Angel” and “Angel.” Chojnowski’s first piece, “Mother of God Nursing,” was how he discovered his woodworking ability. Some of his other pieces include “Mother of Jesus,” “Mother Mary with Child,” and “Molther Divine,” which depicts Mary surrounded by rays of light. In his piece, “Holy Trinity,” he carves the faces of the father and son of God along with a dove. Chojnowski was unable to attend the opening, but his son, Daniel, attended instead. Animals and nature were the subjects of the remaining works by both artists. Chojnowski’s “Thoroughbred Horse” and, “The Bear,” were on display as well as Nowak’s “Daylight” and “Dusk.” The grains gave the work of Nowak an earthy vibe, as did the wood on which Chojnowski’s work was carved. Both artists were born in Poland. Chojnowski’s favorite subjects include animals, emblems and religion. During his 30 years of working as an artist, he’s created more than 500 reliefs, using mostly basswood and linden wood. His work has been featured in New York Times magazine. About 30 of Nowak’s grain compositions were on display at this exhibit. She exhibits extensively in galleries in New Jersey and New York. Both artists’ work can be found in private collections in Poland and the United States. Nowak’s work can also be found in private collections in France and Sweden.

This month, the make-your-own stuffed animal chain founded in 1997 opened eight pop-up shops at AMC Theatres in Florida, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. And, earlier this year, Carnival Cruise Lines added pop-up Build-A-Bear workstations for the first time, with plans to expand to 10 ships by the end of the year and 25 by next summer. “We don’t think of ourselves anymore as a mall retailer,” CEO Sharon John said in an interview. Instead, Build-A-Bear is making changes to ensure it’s where its consumers are. +15  Buy Now FILE PHOTO: Build-A-Bear CEO Sharon John at Build-A-Bear's Overland headquarters on Friday, Feb. 20, 2015. Photo by Cristina Fletes-Boutte, cfletes-boutte@post-dispatch.com Cristina Fletes-Boutté “For a long time, we only had one store format,” said chief operations officer Chris Hurt. “We now have four different kinds.” Having different sizes of its stuffing machines, down to the nozzles and other machinery, means Build-A-Bear can be more nimble to locate in smaller spaces within malls or other retailers that offer more visibility in heavily trafficked areas. Build-A-Bear recently opened some “concourse” locations in spaces as small as 200 square feet, compared with a traditional 3,000-square-foot store. “It’s not that malls aren’t going to be an important part of our portfolio,” John said, adding the chain is looking at adding more stores-within-stores. “You might see us in Carnival ships, or shop-in-shop stores at select Macy’s or Toys R Us stores.” Build-A-Bear also has expanded licensing deals to extend its brand at more retailers. Through a licensing agreement signed a year ago with Toronto-based Spin Master Corp., there are Build-A-Bear Workshop Stuffing Stations available at Walmart and Target nationwide. “It’s been very well received,” John said of the at-home stuffing stations, which sell for between $25 and $30. Licensing deals have been limited primarily to candy and toys, but that’s about to change. “As we turn the corner into the new year, we’ll see the brand manifest into other fresh categories,” John said. For the holiday shopping season, Build-A-Bear added new reindeer characters, Tinsel and Twinkle. Additionally, the chain is adding a new Pokémon character in early December. Since John was hired as CEO in 2013, replacing founder Maxine Clark, Build-A-Bear has been in turnaround mode. The chain closed dozens of underperforming stores in recent years and created a redesigned store layout, dubbed Discovery, that moves the toy stuffer closer to the front of the stores to increase visibility, among other changes. As store leases come up for renewal, the chain is converting to the Discovery store layout, although not yet at its local stores at West County Center or the Galleria. Recent changes also include a new logo and shift in signage at stores that emphasize more blue and less yellow. “We’re approaching our 20th year, and we hadn’t touched the brand in 20 years,” John said. She said by the end of the year, 55 of Build-A-Bear’s 330 stores will have their conversions to the Discovery format completed, with more conversions planned for next year. In addition to its corporate owned stores in North America, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark and China, there are 80 franchised international stores. John’s turnaround efforts helped lead the company to profitability in 2014 and 2015 following several years of losses. Its stock price has risen nearly 35 percent following its most recent quarterly earnings report late last month when the company updated its guidance for the year. Build-A-Bear’s stock closed Friday at $14.35 a share, up from $10.65 a share on Oct. 27. Build-A-Bear expects its fiscal 2016 revenue to increase in the low single-digit range compared to 2015.

Analysts said they expect Build-A-Bear to continue to seek out opportunities for locations outside of the traditional mall store format. “They’ve proven that the Build-A-Bear model works in high traffic locations, and they don’t have to just be in malls,” said Alex Furhman, senior research analyst with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Strategic review As it makes changes to its stores and operations, Build-A-Bear also is undergoing a strategic review process that could include a joint venture partnership or sale, according to analysts. Build-A-Bear announced in May that its board is exploring strategic alternatives, and the company hired Guggenheim Securities as its financial adviser and Bryan Cave as its legal counsel in the review. Build-A-Bear said there’s no timetable for the review process, and executives declined to comment about it. “The process that they’re going through is to evaluate what strategic options exist for them to grow and what capital needs they have to maximize the value of the business and the brand,” said Stephanie Wissink, managing director and senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray & Co. “They might continue operating as an independent entity or find a strategic partner that has assets and capabilities that would be complementary to Build-A-Bear.” Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Published Nov 19th, 2016 8:44 am ltbrannan@aol.com / @tbarkansas TV PREVIEW On this week’s TV edition of Talk Business & Politics, which airs Sundays at 9:30 a.m. on KATV Channel 7 in Central Arkansas and in Northeast Arkansas on KAIT-NBC, Sundays at 10 a.m.: A New Agenda Sen. Tom Cotton. He’s rumored for a position in the Trump administration, but the U.S. Senate has plenty of business ahead. Post-election, what are Cotton’s priorities? We’ll explore. The Aftermath Republicans and Democrats assess the aftermath of the big election. What stats stand out? And where do the two parties go from here? Chris Caldwell, campaign manager for Sen. John Boozman, and Democratic consultant Michael Cook are our guests. Inside the Numbers Plus, we’ll go inside the numbers for 3 numbers that mattered this week in business and politics. From Wal-Mart to Washington, D.C. Tune in to Talk Business & Politics in Central Arkansas on KATV Channel 7, Sundays at 9:30 a.m. and in Northeast Arkansas on KAIT-NBC, Sundays at 10 a.m. Coming in January 2017, Talk Business & Politics will air in Northwest Arkansas on KFSM Channel 5 at 10:30 a.m. following “Face the Nation.” THE 2017 FORTUNE CRYSTAL BALL Once again, Fortune has made its annual predictions from its “well-informed” staff “about the people, products, and trends that will matter in 2017.” The election of Donald Trump to the presidency represents a seismic shift in American politics, an event with implications nearly impossible to predict. One casualty of the election, indeed, may be the science of prediction itself: For all their algorithmic gymnastics, pollsters and betting markets were utterly confounded by Trump’s win. Which is why it’s essential to have a prediction tool that relies as much on art (and whimsy) as it does on science. “And this year, for some extra insight, we’ve even teamed up with artificial-intelligence powerhouse IBM Watson, which mined tens of millions of sources to help us spot hidden trends. Here, we offer our well-informed, intuitive take on the stories that will shape business — and much else — in the coming year.” Read on here. AMAZON WANTS TO BE YOUR HOUSEKEEPER In his annual letter to shareholders, Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos wrote, “We want Prime to be such a good value, you’d be irresponsible not to be a member,” posts Forbes. “To make good on that proposition, Amazon currently offers free two-day deliveries on over 30 million items, free same-day deliveries on hundreds of thousands of products, free video streaming of original series and other programming, free storage on the Amazon Cloud, the Kindle Lending Library, discounted rates on its new streaming music subscription services… The list goes on.” Now, according to reports, it appears as though Amazon plans to add housekeeping services as a perk for its Prime members. Read on at this link. HOW A NEW CEO CAN MAKE A FIRM MORE ENTREPRENEURIAL “A new face at the top brings new hopes, and often, new strategic priorities,” says Harvard Business Review. “When Target hired Brian Cornell as CEO in 2014, expectations were high that he would inject fresh energy into one of the largest U.S. retail chains. When that same year Microsoft replaced CEO Steve Ballmer with Satya Nadella, the move signaled the possibility for major change. Indeed, the company eventually announced its strategy to venture massively into cloud computing.” When new CEOs take charge, they sometimes change or even reverse the entire strategic course of the company – a course that, such as in the case of Microsoft, often aligns with entrepreneurial growth opportunities. Newly appointed CEOs might consider such an entrepreneurial focus attractive for various reasons. Following an entrepreneurial strategy ultimately means that managers and employees of a firm act more proactively and innovatively, and they take more risks — all which is known to drive growth and increase a firm’s advantage against competitors. “Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice shows that new CEOs indeed change a firm’s strategy and that this change tends to go into a more entrepreneurial direction. Interestingly, we found CEOs hired from the outside are more likely to change a firm’s strategy more drastically. However, insider CEOs are more likely to adopt new entrepreneurial strategies much sooner.” There are several reasons for the shift to more entrepreneurial strategies. Learn what they are by clicking here. THE MYTHS DEMOCRATS SWALLOWED THAT COST THEM THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION An editorial writer for The Scoop posts, “I have no problem with anyone who voted for Trump, because they wanted a Trump presidency. I have an enormous problem with anyone who voted for Trump or Stein or Johnson — or who didn’t vote at all — and who now expresses horror about the outcome of this election. If you don’t like the consequences of your own actions, shut the hell up.” The problem this election season has been that liberal Democrats — just like too many Republicans — have been consumed by provably false conspiracy theories. They have trafficked in them on Facebook and Twitter, they have read only websites that confirm what they want to believe, and they have, in the past few months, unknowingly gulped down Russian propaganda with delight. In other words, just like the conservatives they belittle, they have been inside a media bubble that blocked them from reality. So before proceeding, let’s address a few fantasies about this campaign: Here. TRUMP TEAM PLANNING SPECIAL VICTORY TOUR POLITICO posts, “President-elect Donald Trump will be embarking on a ‘victory tour’ to the states he carried, a campaign aide told reporters Thursday.” “We’re working on a victory tour now; it will happen in the next couple of weeks,” said George Gigicos, the campaign’s advance team director, who briefly talked about Trump’s first trip, according to pool reports. For more on this story, go to this link. THE DIVIDE BETWEEN CITY AND COUNTRY “The 2016 election exposed a chasm between urban and non-urban America that will likely widen under a Trump administration,” says The Atlantic. The earthquake that elected Donald Trump has left the United States approaching 2020 with a political landscape reminiscent of 1920. Not since then has the cultural chasm between urban and non-urban America shaped the struggle over the country’s direction as much as today. Of all the overlapping generational, racial, and educational divides that explained Trump’s stunning upset over Hillary Clinton last week, none proved more powerful than the distance between the Democrats’ continued dominance of the largest metropolitan areas, and the stampede toward the GOP almost everywhere else. “Trump’s victory was an empire-strikes-back moment for all the places and voters that feel left behind in an increasingly diverse, post-industrial, and urbanized America. Squeezing bigger margins from smaller places, Trump overcame a tide of resistance in the largest metropolitan areas that allowed Clinton to carry the national popular vote, but not the decisive Electoral College.” “This election thus carved a divide between cities and non-metropolitan areas as stark as American politics has produced since the years just before and after 1920. That year marked a turning point: It was the first time the Census recorded that more people lived in urban than non-urban areas. That tangible sense of shifting influence triggered a series of political and social conflicts between big cities teeming with immigrants, many of them Catholic, and small towns and rural communities that remained far more homogeneously, white, native-born, and Protestant.” For the complete post, follow this link. THE FIREWORKS OF THE FUTURE “In the 18 minutes it takes to blow up 30-some tons of fireworks for the Fourth of July show on the National Mall in D.C., it costs the government more than 200 grand. Bigger shows—like the massive Macy’s show in New York City—can cost millions,” reports Fast Company. “Fireworks also make local air pollution spike, and can pollute water and soil when chemicals and heavy metals shower down from the pyrotechnics.” But everyone likes a show. So Intel is attempting to pioneer an alternative that’s just as mesmerizing to watch: hundreds of drones, choreographed into a spectacular light display. The company first tested the idea in 2015, in an experiment with 100 manually programmed drones. Now they’ve unveiled a new drone, called the Shooting Star, designed for light shows. An algorithm automatically programs the drones to fly in formation, and a single pilot can run the display. Prepare to be amazed here. MUSK SAYS TELSA’S SOLAR SHINGLES WILL COST LESS THAN A DUMB ROOF Bloomberg reports, “It’s official: After Tesla shareholders approved the acquisition of SolarCity, the new company is now an unequivocal sun-to-vehicle energy firm. And Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk didn’t take long to make his first big announcement as head of this new enterprise.” Minutes after shareholders approved the deal — about 85 percent of them voted yes — Musk told the crowd that he had just returned from a meeting with his new solar engineering team. Tesla’s new solar roof product, he proclaimed, will actually cost less to manufacture and install than a traditional roof—even before savings from the power bill. “Electricity,” Musk said, “is just a bonus.” “If Musk’s claims prove true, this could be a real turning point in the evolution of solar power. The rooftop shingles he unveiled just a few weeks ago are something to behold: They’re made of textured glass and are virtually indistinguishable from high-end roofing products. They also transform light into power for your home and your electric car.” More on this incredible new Telsa rooftop at this link. AN ENTIRE MBA INTO ONE ONLINE COURSE Business Insider says, “If your’e looking to sharpen your finance knowledge before diving in, Udemy is currently offering a course just for you. Chris Haroun has guest lectured and advised at McGill and Columbia Universities, respectively, worked a Goldman Sachs, and authored “101 Crucial Lessons They Don’t Teach You in Business School,” which was recently named by Forbes magazine as “1 of 6 books that all entrepreneurs need to read right now”.” Haroun has taken lessons he’s taught at universities in the past and condensed them into one course that he describes as “an entire MBA.” “Through the class students will learn macro and micro economics, how to value companies, and the basics of how investment banks and management consulting firms work. In addition to the nuts and bolts, Haroun aims to teach his students about the importance of personal connections and professional presentation: how to identify and pitch venture capitalists and communicate your ideas clearly and concisely. And talk about a Black Friday deal. You’ll be amazed at how much this course costs. But you’d better hurry. Course details at this link.

November 19, 2016 at 6:35 am 12 News Share! Facebook Tweet Google+ Tumblr Pinterest OAKLAND — A San Jose woman on Tuesday made her first court appearance on special circumstance murder charges in the death of an Oakland couple and their son, a triple slaying that has the victims’ family members searching for answers. Dana Rivers, 61, is accused of fatally shooting and stabbing semi-retired Berkeley school district teacher Patricia Wright, 57, and her wife Charlotte Reed, 56, fatally shooting Wright’s 19-year-old son Benny Diambu-Wright and then setting fire to the family’s East Oakland home in an attempt to destroy evidence. Dana Rivers Rivers, a former Sacramento school teacher, gained national attention when she had a sex change operation to become a woman in the 1990s. “It’s just unbelievable,” said Michael Campbell, the father of Wright’s other son, Khari. He described the slain women as “normal moms.” Diambu-Wright was an aspiring nurse who was attending Laney College and working at Walmart. Wright and Reed had been married for over a year and had three children between them. Rivers was described as an acquaintance. “I knew this woman (Rivers),” said Wright’s son Khari Campbell-Wright, 19. “I don’t know the whole confines of what was going on. I know she (Rivers) was in a motorcycle club. My mom had no part of it. My brother had no part of it. “Wrong place, wrong time,” he said. Police said Rivers was covered with blood and was about to flee on a motorcycle belonging to Reed when she was arrested by police about 12:30 a.m. Friday, moments after officers responded to the house in the 9400 block of Dunbar Drive for reports of gunfire. Authorities said Rivers had tried to set the house ablaze but her fire was confined to the garage area and quickly controlled. Diambu-Wright was found shot to death outside the front of the two-story house. Court documents identified him as Toto M. Diambu, but his family and neighbors said he was known as Benny Diambu-Wright. Inside the house, police found the Wright and Reed stabbed and shot. Rivers was charged with three counts of murder, the special circumstance that there were multiple killings, arson of an inhabited structure and possession of metal knuckles. The charges call for life in prison without the possibility of parole and make her eligible for the death penalty if the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office decides to pursue capital punishment. Authorities have not released a motive but have indicated it might have been a dispute over some property. In court documents, police said Rivers “began to make spontaneous statements about her involvement in the murders.” The document also states that officers found ammunition and knives in her pockets. Two decades ago, Rivers had a sex-change operation to become a woman and was dismissed as a school teacher in a Sacramento suburb. Born David Warfield, she was an award-winning school teacher before she began hormone treatments and surgeries to become a woman in 1999, according to the Associated Press and other media accounts. After she made her intentions known to school officials at Center High School in suburban Sacramento, the school district put her on administrative leave and eventually dismissed her. She sued and reached a settlement. Rivers is being held at Santa Rita Jail without bail and returns to court Wednesday morning. ___ (c)2016 the Contra Costa Times (Walnut Creek, Calif.)

This, 26 years after suing the school where he worked when they rightly decided to get the freak away from impressionable students who probably had to endure his non-stop LGBTQ rants every day in class. I’d be fine with the death penalty. Give him the chair. VN:D [1.9.6_1107] Rating: 4.7/5 (3 votes cast) ltuser November 20, 2016 at 1:27 am So if IT’s convicted, which jail does it go to??

This “trans” thing is nothing but a tool of satan to get people to go against God. God is not to be mocked. What a man sows, he will reap. When reading about these people, it reminds me of geldings and of ancient slave men who were eunuchs and used to guard women. Back then, everyone recognized that these animals and people were not as they were created to be. The slaves were not normal men. And a woman cannot have a “wife.” A woman can have a housekeeper.

In America, these moral parameters were inspired by the Word of God. They work. They have contributed to the success of the greatest country on earth. “Normal Moms,” two women married to each other? Absolutely not! Here lies part of the huge problem: journalists, in their pursuit of political correctness, attempt to normalize perverted behavior through their condescending writings. Two women or two men who are “married to each other,” are unable to produce children. “They had three children among them.” Please explain. Every child has a father. Maybe the father is gone. Maybe he is dead or in prison. Maybe he just bailed. If the children were adopted, then say so. Women are unable to produce children without a man. That is just the way it was, is, and will continue to be. At times, political correctness consists of straight out lies. Part of the price that must be paid for living in a free country is to not expect everyone to agree with your lifestyle. Of course we need not be rude. We must not murder people either.

Such tactics have changed some of the psychology that used to go into getting people to camp out beside stores on Black Friday. “There’s this psychological idea of scarcity,” said Nelson. “As humans, we’re kind of wired to pay a lot of attention to when there’s a limited amount of time or a limited amount of quantity. Black Friday has been both of those things in the past. There was only one day, and you could get those deals for only that day and a lot of times they’d run out of whatever product it was.” Nelson says that consumers are smart and they’ve learned through the last few holiday cycles that they can get really good deals on days that are not Black Friday.

[KCOY] On Sunday evening, a driver parked a green Ford Mustang in a lot in front of the popular El Pueblo Mexican restaurant, as well as the John Deere complex and Walmart shopping center on Blosser Road. Around 6 p.m., flames erupted from the Mustang which had been severely vandalized, officials said. Santa Maria Fire Battalion Chef Mike Barneich said the incident is currently under investigation as an arson, and it might have been politically charged. Barneich said the fire started in the passenger compartment and extended into the motor area. Firefighters controlled the blaze within a few minutes. The owner of the Mustang said he lost most of his personal belongings and irreplaceable personal items in the arson attack. He confirmed his car had a Trump bumper sticker on it but would not comment further on the incident. Authorities have not made any arrests. There were a lot of witnesses at the scene, but none of them have spoken with authorities, Barneich said. Surveillance cameras failed to capture any suspects in the case. It is believed that it was either too dark outside or the cameras were not working properly at the time. Loading...

Emotions upon Obama’s election were just as vehement but not nearly as destructive. Instead of protests in elementary school classrooms there were Obama chants that likened his as the second coming.

Monday, November 21, 2016 Facebook Twitter RSS Navigate Home News Opinion Regions World Sports Business Special Features SPECIAL REPORTS The Sunday Times You are at:Home»Weekly»The Sunday Times Magazine»Janine Tugonon spreads her wings Janine Tugonon spreads her wings 1 By CARLA BIANCA RAVANES-HIGHAM on November 19, 2016 The Sunday Times Magazine Tweet It was the year 2012, and just like clockwork, the nation tuned into their televisions in the middle of the day to cheer on the Philippines’ candidate to the Miss Universe pageant. She may not have won the crown that year—albeit landing an impressive first-runner up finish—but four years later, she would bring pride to her country all the same, gaining wings and flying high all on her own in the Big Apple. From the Universe to NYC New York City is filled with beautiful people, and right smack in the middle of this pulsating vibe is the Filipina runner-up of Miss Universe 2012, Janine Tugnon. Now 27 years old, the former beauty queen exudes a different kind of confidence. It is the kind of confidence that belongs to someone who has seen the world, and because of it, developed a depth that wasn’t quite there before. This, despite the fact that she has had her share of notable achievements even before she decided to move to the United States in 2013. It was the year 2012 when the nation tuned into their televisions to cheer for Janine Tugonon, the Philippines’ candidate to the Miss Universe pageant AFP FILE PHOTO To be sure, Tugonon knows what it feels to succeed. A consistent honor student since her elementary days, she was crowned Bb. Pilipinas-Universe shortly after graduating Cum Laude as a Pharmacy major at the University of Sto. Tomas. Diverted by the beauty queen path from her college degree, she found herself uncertain what to do next with only a first runner-up sash from Miss Universe to her name. “I consider that phase of my life as a transition period. I steered away from the plan I created for myself and ventured into [what I felt]was God’s plan and purpose for me,” recalled Tugonon in this one-on-one interview with The Sunday Times Magazine. “I remember being so raw and new in the [modeling]industry. I have always been known to speak my mind, and I learned the hard way there’s a downside to that, especially in this industry. I was overwhelmed at that time yet I knew in my heart that I had to keep going.” Criticized and bashed for her bold move, Tugonon also learned through this time to keep her head up no matter what. “I’m the type of person who forgets criticism, which is good. I don’t focus on the negative and instead choose to focus on people who encourage, help, and support me. I just work hard and try to offer words of love, life, and encouragement.” Crossing oceans Tugonon says she has always wanted to live somewhere in the West, growing up watching American shows, curious what it would be like to live there “I have always wanted to live somewhere in the West,” shared Tugonon of her decision to try her luck abroad. “I grew up watching American shows and I was always curious what it was like to live there. It was my mom who saw the scholarship offered by Miss Universe for the New York Film Academy, and with her encouragement, I decided to fly across the world to pursue my interest in acting.” With a dream in her heart and an unwavering faith that she will be guided by the heavens, Janine took on her life’s biggest adventure. Besides studying, she also pursued modeling, which initially she thought would be easy. She humbly confessed, however, “When I started modeling, I thought I was going to book a lot of jobs constantly. Because to be honest, Filipina beauty is appreciated everywhere, most especially in the States. Even people in the streets would be quick to approach you to say so but in the first weeks after signing with my agency, I wasn’t getting the jobs. I was worried my agent would drop me.” Luckily, her agent, Francis Arden believed in her spirit and kept her on, but all the same, the usually optimistic young lady still felt dejected. “I was thinking that there was something wrong with me because I wasn’t booking jobs. I focused instead on losing weight while figuring out the modeling industry. It was extremely frustrating, but eventually patience paid off, and the projects became more consistent. They weren’t huge jobs, mind you, but enough to tide me over—to pay the bills, and the rent.” Frugal with money, she sustained herself through her time in New York and stints in Los Angeles. Soon enough, Tugonon became the face for many US brands including Wells Fargo, Walmart, and Kohl’s. It was in August this year that Janine Tugonon became the very first Filipina model to join the exclusive clique of Victoria Secret Angels through a 50-seconder online ad known as ‘VS Pink’ Asked how she overcame rejections before her modelling career finally picked up, she replied, “The idea of doing something else kills me. I knew this was what I wanted to pursue, and while there were days questioned it—when I didn’t have jobs lined up—something came up soon enough. The Provider provides if you’re on the right track, you just have to trust Him.” The determined lady also credits a strong support system for seeing her through her toughest times, like her friend Rasec Marc Ortega who pushed her to keep going. “He just told me, ‘Keep at it, keep at it.’ There are people placed in your life for a reason. Keep them, love them, and support them too.” Most of all, Tugonon believes her faith was her strongest and most effective shield from giving up. “Faith is everything. Without it, I would have given up a long time ago. I never liked rejections. I grew up an achiever and was a consistent honor student, so imagine how I feel about rejection. It’s discouraging, but the thing is, when God puts something in your heart, like I said the Provider provides, even in the most challenging moments. And while He won’t give it quickly, because He is building your character to prepare you for what He has in store, He is always there for you.” She is grateful for the challenges that taught her the virtue of humility. “I realized it’s because of Him that I am where I am.” Winged woman Besides studying acting at the New York Film Academy— under a scholarship— Tugonon pursued modeling It was in August this year that Janine Tugonon became the very first Filipina model to join the exclusive clique of Victoria Secret Angels. She appeared in a 50-seconder online ad known as “VS Pink.” She said of her big break, “It felt really great and I will be forever grateful to the team [behind the project]. It is one of those ads that you think is a stepping stone to something more, and true enough they called me for the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show casting.” Despite missing the cut, Tugonon served as an inspiration to Filipinas who hope to break through the international modeling scene. And like she said, when something you hope for does not happen at first, it only means “the Provider” has a different plan for you. Sure enough, she was chosen as one of the 12 winners of the annual search for the Nu Muses Calendar, which gave her the opportunity to work with renowned French fashion photographer David Bellemere whose works fill the pages of Vogue Paris, Marie Claire Italy, Nippon Vogue, and Elle USA to name a few. Her shoot for the calendar in the Dominican Republic was only the beginning of this exciting project, which has taken Tugonon back home to Manila. Apparently, each of the 12 featured models will be filmed in their home country as part of an exclusive documentary, and the beautiful balikbayan is now here for her part of it. According to Tugonon, both the docu and the calendar will be launched at Art Basil in Miami, after which she and the other featured models will be given the chance to grace the covers of international glossy magazines. It was the smart lady’s definition of timeless beauty, which landed her a place among the 12 winners. Tugonon said, “The question to define timeless beauty was actually tough. But as cliché as it may sound, I said beauty comes from within and it’s true. If we fill our minds with comparison, insecurities, hatred, it will reflect in our overall aura and how we deal with people. Inner peace and security goes a long way.” She also said that Filipinas stand out among women around the world “because our beauty is unique, and because of our good work ethic.” Janine today Tugonon is happily busy these days—thriving in a career she continues to work hard for. Not one to forget her beauty queen roots, Tugonon was spotted twice bonding with her Miss Universe Philippines successors, Miss Universe 2015 Pia Wurtzbach (topmost) and Miss Universe Philippines 2016 Maxine Medina (above) “I’ve taken a part time job in a clothing store at night, while I continue to pursue modeling,” she humbly said. “I don’t consider myself ‘there’ yet but I thank God for the projects that are coming. I won’t have to worry about rent for the next few months!” she added laughing. “But there’s more work to be done—I’m just hopeful, expectant, and positive.” When asked what her advice is to women who are passionate about their dreams, she replied, “First, never compare. Each and everyone has a purpose. There are different routes for different people. Never compare your journey to another person’s journey. Just stay on your path because comparing makes you lose sight of where you’re going. “Comparing ourselves leads to doubt, anger, and jealousy and we become discouraged and insecure,” she continued. “This is where crab mentality stems from. We all have a different and unique purpose so once you find that purpose, never give up, just keep at it. “It’s not going to be easy, there will be pain and heartaches but you have to keep running your race. Work hard and strive for excellence. Don’t settle, and be the best you can be. Be right with people, have fun through the journey, and have faith you’ll be fine.” Finally asked to describe Janine Tugonon today, she declared, “I am more confident and convinced that this is the path I was made to take. When I was younger, I was hesitant and terrified to pursue it. Now, I am more focused on what the Lord has planned for me.” Share.

Shardai T. Nichols allegedly left a sleeping child in the back seat of a car, police say. (SCCF)  Police said they noticed the car because it was parked in a fire lane outside the main entrance to the store when they arrived around 5:30 p.m. Monday. As one of the officers was writing a ticket, the cop saw a child asleep on the back seat of the vehicle, police said. The driver of the vehicle, Shardai T. Nichols, 21, of Salem came out of the store on South Broadway and allegedly gave officers a false name. Authorities said there were four outstanding warrants against her. Nichols was arrested and charged with child neglect and interfering with an officer, according to police. The the child was turned over to a family member and the state Department of Children and Families was notified. Police did not say if the child in the car was a boy or girl or give the age of the child. Man using dead cop's ID to bilk banks Bail on the child neglect and police interference charges for Nichols was set at $15,000, police said.

You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You’re all set! Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ammar Campa-Najjar November 19 However history looks back on this election, I like to believe that many of us will remember what comes next as not only a challenging time for diversity in America but also an empowering one. I understand why some people may struggle with the idea of this diversity. It’s still a radical idea after all, this notion of a nation with roots from every nation. Think about it, we are the only civilization on earth ever to be founded on this defiant worldview: that our individual differences don’t outweigh our common humanity. In many ways, America is still ahead of its time. I love this country because it’s a place where the ultimate comeback stories are written — including my family’s own story. Only in America can the son of a Hispanic woman from the barrio and an Arab man from an occupied territory have the freedom to reimagine his life and pursue his dreams. I spent my early years with my family under siege by American-made helicopters and F-16s that leveled entire buildings on the block where we lived. And then, just as surreally, I spent the second part of my life working for the U.S. government, entrusted with serving the American public. It’s not the perfect love story, but I know what I’ve witnessed in my life is nothing short of an American miracle. My father, Yasser Najjar, saw both his parents gunned down right in front of him when he was only 11 years old. Orphaned and outlawed, my father moved across Egypt, Lebanon and Morocco in search of a new home. On his 18th birthday, he found himself at a critical crossroads: continue seeking refuge across the Middle East, or move westward to America. He chose America, and America chose him. In 1986, on a sunny San Diego day, my father met my mother and they soon married. In 1993, my father asked the family to relocate to the Middle East for a few years so that he could help Yasser Arafat lead a secular unity government. Today, baba is a law-abiding, taxpaying, American Muslim who has devoted his life to promoting peace between Israel and the Palestinian people. His pain was turned into purpose, to make the world a better place for his children. Ammar Campa-Najjar as a young boy with his father, Yasser Najjar. (Courtesy of Ammar Campa-Najjar) My mother, Abigail Campa, the modest Mexican Catholic daughter of an orphaned migrant farmworker, showed me through a divorce and financial difficulty that you can dust yourself off and start again, that there’s dignity in a hard day’s work, and that your work doesn’t define you, it reveals you. She went from working as a receptionist to applying to work in a Walmart in her 50s to a career in real estate. She repeatedly inconvenienced her life for mine, whether it was choosing to live in a war zone just so her boys could have a father present or interrupting work to drive me home from school, to soccer games, to church. Her pain too was turned into purpose — to show her children all true love can do. I’ll never forget watching my mother weep when I was 9 years old. My abuelita flew from San Diego all the way to Tel Aviv to visit, only to be turned away. The second intifada — a brutal war between Israel and the Palestinian people — broke out the hour she landed. Nobody could enter, and nobody could leave. My mom’s source of comfort was so close, yet so far. I vowed to never show weakness or let her see me cry. So I didn’t cry when we said goodbye to our family in San Diego to live in the Palestinian territories for a few years. I didn’t cry when I watched a boy my age, Muhammad al-Durrah, get shot and killed while hiding behind a barrel. I didn’t cry the night they cut off the electricity to all of Gaza City, and I, my mom, stepmom, dad and younger brothers hid in the dark corner of a cold kitchen floor as they carpet bombed our neighborhood. I didn’t cry when we had to leave baba behind and finally return to the United States in August 2001. I didn’t cry when war clung to our lives like a disease and followed us to America. I didn’t cry that September when 19 terrorist hijackers committed mass murder at the World Trade Center. I didn’t cry that week when the Islamic school I attended was vandalized and declared unsafe to study or pray in. And then after working alongside hundreds of people who volunteered their labor and love to elect a man of color president of the United States, I left the only two people I’d never been separated from, my mom and younger brother, to pursue my dreams of working in Washington. Just before the inauguration in January 2013, I stood gawking at my new workplace — that grand, glorious, mysterious structure on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, where Lincoln still walks at night. Ammar Campa-Najjar outside the White House. (Courtesy of Ammar Campa=Najjar) After not being considered Arab enough in Gaza, Latino enough for the barrio, or American enough in my own country, after so many shut doors, the door to all others finally opened. On that day, in those hallowed halls, I cried. The pain was given purpose: to live to tell you this story and to give others hope. The morning after the election, I went to work for President Obama in a building where President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team had already begun settling in. There was no time to process anything. I felt sad, scared, angry, confused and numb, all at the same time. I don’t know what’s going to happen next. All I can do is take things one day at a time and be ready to respond to what’s around the corner. We can take time to feel, but then we have to regroup and move forward as one nation. In 61 days, Obama will depart the White House and it will be up to all of us, ordinary citizens, to once again be the ones we’ve been waiting for. Let’s not seek comfort in the easy traps of either normalizing or demonizing the decision half of America has made. We must do what is hard, what is necessary and what is right. We must hold our families and communities close with a firm grip, but also extend an open hand to those who reject us. We must take a stand but also find a way to understand. America’s destiny has never been at the mercy of one person. It’s always been about all of us, placing our mortal hands on the arc of history and bending it slowly, sometimes too slowly, toward justice once again. So even in our darkest hours as a nation, don’t let anyone tell you our differences are too vast to bridge, or that your individual struggles are too hard to overcome. Chase the American Dream, have faith in the alchemy of America, turn your pain into purpose and begin writing your own ultimate comeback story. Ammar Campa-Najjar, the Hispanic-Arab American son of immigrants who was born in San Diego, works for the U.S. government in Washington.

Nov. 14, 2016 next play/pause pre Port Perry Star By Chris Hall SCUGOG -- Durham’s efforts to address the quantity and quality of municipal water for Port Perry is continuing this fall. The Region began the process of searching for additional water supply and storage for the urban Port Perry area in early 2010 and has now identified a recommended solution. The preferred option is to drill additional wells and build a new treatment facility near the existing municipal wells just south of Port Perry and also establish a new elevated water storage tank near the Port Perry Walmart plaza. Durham’s goal, say Regional officials, is to find additional water to support future growth planned for Port Perry and address the unsavory characteristics that can now be found in the current municipal water supply. That effort took another step forward last week when crews began coring a hole near the existing Port Perry municipal wells to obtain soil samples that will help determine a water source and provide detailed information for when a well is eventually drilled. The coring continued this week as crews bore deeper into the ground, pulling up high-quality continuous soil samples in three-inch tubes that provided Durham officials with glimpses of what lay beneath the surface -- tell-tale signs of glacial movements from thousands of years ago and hints as to where the water is located. The plan, according to Regional officials, was to core down to a depth of about 70 metres or 230-feet. “This will tell us what the geotechnical formation is, where the water is,” explained Rich Tindall, a project manager with Durham Region. “This will help us figure out where the water is.” When the Region is confident that water can be found, it’s expected that a test well will be drilled in December and pump tests will be carried out in early 2017. The plan is to add another well to the three existing wells located on the east side of Simcoe Street, north of Scugog Line 3. A new treatment building is also planned for that location. Under the Durham Region Official Plan, the number of residents in the urban Port Perry area is expected to increase to just under 12,000 people by 2031, requiring the need for additional water. “Capacity is not an issue right now, but it will be down the road,” said Tindall. Regional officials also hope that any new water source will address the aesthetic qualities of the current municipal water that runs through Port Perry, specifically the ubiquitous “rotten egg” smell from hydrogen sulfide and high iron levels. “The driver right now is the aesthetics. The water quality is fine, it’s just the aesthetics,” added Tindall. “We hope we have a promising water supply of good quality and quantity.” Through its class environmental assessment, the Region tossed around a variety of options to address Port Perry’s need for additional potable water but ultimately decided on adding to the three existing wells that currently service Scugog’s largest urban area. Options that were cast aside included doing nothing, limiting growth in the urban areas and introducing water conservation measures. Durham also considered drilling wells at a new site, creating a new Lake Scugog-based water treatment plant and sourcing water from existing wells in Blackstock, Greenbank and Uxbridge, as well as those in Whitby or Oshawa. If everything goes as planned, Durham officials hope to design the treatment building in 2018 and start construction in 2020. The preliminary cost for the design portion is $3 million and construction will be approximately $14.8 million, said Tindall. Once additional water supplies are found, Durham must also find a way to store it. The current standpipe storage tank located near Port Perry High School currently does not have enough capacity to sufficiently meet fire needs or the forecasted Port Perry population, say Regional officials. During the current review, the Region considered five options for storage, including adding an elevated tank near the existing standpipe, introducing an elevated tank near the Scugog Line 4 and Old Simcoe Road intersection or somewhere along Hwy. 7A, and building an inground storage tank near the existing wells. Durham ultimately decided on an elevated tank east of Taylor Boulevard, within the Port Perry employment lands area. The existing standpipe storage tank will remain in service. Design work on the new storage tank is expected to take place in 2017 and construction is expected to begin in 2019 and take two years. The Region plans on holding another public meeting next spring in Port Perry to update residents on the search for a new water source. And, while Durham carries out its groundwater exploration program south of Port Perry, work continues just north of town to expand the Nonquon Water Pollution Control Plant. The Region needed to expand the sewage treatment plant as well to meet the needs of the growing urban Port Perry area. “It’s winding up, (construction) will be done somewhere near the end of the year,” said Tindall. The treatment building and accompanying tanks are “pretty much done” while construction work continues on the administration building, he added. It’s expected the work will be completed on budget and time, depending on weather. “We know it’s Canada,” said Tindall. Once construction is completed, it will take time for new facility to become operational. “The whole treatment plant, functioning and running by itself as intended, will be early 2017,” said Tindall.

Pan going into the weekend of the RSM Classic at St. Simons Island, Ga., the final PGA Tour event of the year. Hughes at was at 14-under 128. There wasn't much of a gallery at Sea Island on another pristine day for scoring, so ideal that the cut came at 5-under par. That probably won't change for the weekend, especially with tournament host Davis Love III and Sea Island neighbors Zach Johnson and Matt Kuchar among those missing the cut. It was the lowest cut on the PGA Tour since 5 under at the 2015 Zurich Classic. Twenty-five players were separated by just five shots with two more rounds to play. That group includes Jim Furyk and Stewart Cink. Four shots behind was Jonathan Byrd, a five-time PGA Tour winner who spent last year on the Web.com Tour and still doesn't have full status. He is playing this week on a sponsor's exemption. Bryce Molder (Conway) shot a 5-under 65 and is 10 under going into the weekend. He is tied for 7th. Tag Ridings (Arkansas Razorbacks) had a 67 and is 7 under. Ken Duke (Arkadelphia, Henderson State) did not make the cut. Ko out front by 3 Lydia Ko shot a tournament-record 10-under 62 on Friday to take a three-stroke lead in the CME Group Tour Championship at Naples, Fla., putting the top-ranked New Zealander in position to sweep the season points title and player of the year award. The 2014 winner at Tiburon Golf Club, Ko birdied four of the first six holes and had seven birdies and a bogey on the back nine to get to 12-under 132 in the LPGA Tour season finale. Ryann O'Toole (67) and So Yeon Ryu (68) were tied for second, and Sei Young Kim (68) and Beatriz Recari (68) followed at 8 under. The 62 matched Ko's lowest score of the season, shot in the second round of her Wal-Mart NW Arkansas victory in June. First-round leader Shanshan Feng followed her opening 66 with a 73 to drop into a tie for 16th at 5 under. Stacy Lewis (Arkansas Razorbacks) shot a 2-under 70 and is 3 under after two rounds. Gaby Lopez (Razorbacks) had a 3-under 69 and is 3 over going into the weekend. Pair share 1-stroke lead Sergio Garcia and Francesco Molinari share a one-stroke lead halfway through the World Tour Championship in Dubai after shooting 5-under-par 67s on Friday. They each made six birdies and a solitary bogey, and moved to 9-under 135 totals, one better than overnight leader Lee Westwood. Westwood carded a 70, dropping a shot on the final hole after hitting his second shot into the water. Fellow Englishman Tyrrell Hatton (66), Austria's Bernd Wiesberger (67), South African Charl Schwartzel (67) and Dutchman Joost Luiten (69) were tied for fourth at 7 under in the season-ending championship of the European Tour. Defending champion Rory McIlroy improved on his horror start of 75 with a 68. BASEBALL Cashner to Rangers Right-hander Andrew Cashner is going home for a spot in the Texas Rangers' rotation. A person familiar with the decision told The Associated Press on Friday that the free agent pitcher and the team had reached an agreement on a $10 million, one-year deal. That person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal was pending a physical and wasn't finalized, and the AL West champions had not made an official announcement. Cashner, 30, a Texas native who was a first-round draft pick out of TCU in 2008, finished last season with the Miami Marlins after the San Diego Padres traded him July 29. He was 5-11 with a 5.25 ERA in 28 games last season. Cashner has a 31-53 record with a 3.89 ERA in 202 career games. Are Marlins for sale? A Boston-based investment firm headed by former presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his oldest son, Tagg, looked into buying the Miami Marlins, South Florida's major league baseball franchise, in recent weeks, according to a report in the Boston Globe. A potential deal involving Boston-based Solamere Capital appears to have fallen through, according to the report. Jeffrey Loria has owned the Marlins since 2002. The Marlins declined to comment on the report. Matt Waldrip, who works in business development and external affairs at Solamere, told the Globe that Mitt Romney himself was not heavily involved in the talks. "Mitt Romney is associated with the firm but he's not leading the charge on this by any stretch of the imagination," Waldrip said. "We (had) been looking at the Marlins on behalf of some of the families that are a part of Solamere." TENNIS Murray advances Andy Murray retained his No. 1 ranking for at least another day. The Wimbledon champion qualified for the semifinals of the ATP finals on Friday in London by beating Stan Wawrinka 6-4, 6-2. Murray, who needs to do better than Novak Djokovic this weekend to finish the season as the top-ranked player, broke Wawrinka late in the first set and twice at the start of the second. Murray took over the No. 1 ranking at the Paris Masters this month, but Djokovic can take it back if the second-ranked Serb does better at the season-ending tournament. Djokovic has already qualified for the semifinals. Murray will next face Milos Raonic today, while Djokovic meets Kei Nishikori. In Friday's late match, Marin Cilic beat Nishikori 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 after the semifinal spots had already been decided. BASKETBALL Sterling drops lawsuit Former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling has dropped a lawsuit that claimed the NBA, his wife and others conspired to illegally sell the team for $2 billion. Sterling's lawyer, Bobby Samini, said he filed a request Friday to have the federal appeals case dismissed and that a settlement was reached. He would not reveal details but said Sterling is "very happy with the outcome." However, the lawyer for his wife, Shelly Sterling, calls it a capitulation. Messages seeking NBA comment weren't immediately returned. Sterling was banned from the NBA for life in 2014 after it was revealed he'd made racist remarks to a friend. His antitrust suit was filed in 2014 after his wife agreed to sell the Clippers to ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. A judge dismissed the suit in March. SOCCER Soccer Federation, women’s team in contract talks Talks are ongoing between players for the World Cup-winning U.S. women’s national team and the U.S. Soccer Federation in advance of the Dec. 31 expiration of their current contract. The team played its final two matches of the season last week in California. On Sunday, the CBS news show 60 Minutes is set to air an interview with a group of players. The team has been playing under a memorandum of understanding between the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team Players Association and the USSF that was struck in March 2013 and runs through the end of this year. Earlier this year, a group of players filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging wage discrimination. They claimed that they are not paid the same as their counterparts on the men’s national team. Defender Becky Sauerbrunn told The Associated Press this week that the two sides met a couple of weeks ago and more talks are scheduled for this month and December. “We’re still fighting very hard for equal pay,” she said. “We’re not going to move on that. We’re always encouraged because we know that’s what we’re fighting for and we feel like we’re in the right to fight for something like that. Really, it’s convincing U.S. Soccer that we deserve that.” U.S. Soccer reiterated Friday that it is working to reach a new collective bargaining agreement with the women’s national team. Much of the disparity in wages between the men’s and women’s teams stem from the different ways the players are paid. The women earn salaries while the men are paid based on national team appearances, results and other factors. The pay structure was set up under separate collective bargaining agreements negotiated by unions for the men’s and women’s teams. There has been no decision in the EEOC complaint, which was brought by Sauerbrunn, Hope Solo, Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and Carli Lloyd. All five were on the team that won the World Cup last year in Canada. The U.S. women’s team is coming off a disappointing showing at the Olympics this summer in Brazil, where they were ousted by Sweden in the quarterfinals. The U.S. had won three consecutive gold medals going into the Rio Games.

Michael Cwiklinski By Jonathan D. Silver / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette More than a week after authorities say Michael Cwiklinski gunned down his wife and two Canonsburg police officers before fatally shooting himself, investigators Friday still had not determined what spurred the former Army sharpshooter to deadly violence. But a glimpse into the 47-year-old machine shop technician’s frame of mind can be found in a four-page mental health evaluation that was part of a plea deal between his lawyer and the Washington County District Attorney’s office in a domestic violence case involving his wife. In the January evaluation, Mr. Cwiklinski, a self-described workaholic, disclosed that he had been in military combat and endured life-threatening experiences while in the Army. But besides a determination that “military combat was Mr. Cwiklinski’s trauma” and mentions of “periodic anger problems” and a separation from his wife, Dalia Sabae, nothing in the report indicated that he might be teetering on the edge of murder. Instead it stated that he had enjoyed a stable childhood and did not suffer from any depression, anxiety attacks, psychiatric problems or hospitalizations. The only medication he took was for blood pressure. “Suicidal ideas or intentions are denied,” Steven Adams, a licensed professional counselor, wrote in the report, which the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette went to court to obtain. “Homicidal ideas or intentions are denied.” Both determinations proved off the mark. On Nov. 10, Canonsburg police officers Scott Bashioum and James Saieva responded to a duplex on Woodcrest Drive for a domestic violence call. Investigators said Mr. Cwiklinski — who earned a sharpshooter marksmanship badge in the Army — shot and killed Officer Bashioum, 52, and wounded Officer Saieva. After a lengthy standoff, police found Mr. Cwiklinski dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound; they also found the body of Ms. Sabae, 28, and determined that he had killed her. At the time of her death, Ms. Sabae had a restraining order against her husband of less than two years. David Bayard Wolf, the attorney who represented Mr. Cwiklinski in the domestic violence case, said the Canonsburg native met his future wife, a native of Egypt, online and later in person while traveling in Russia. “Just as a disinterested observer, it was an odd coupling,” Mr. Wolf said this week. “She was a wonderful person. The whole situation is just very sad.” Six months after their wedding — presided over by District Judge Jay Weller, who would later oversee the plea deal in the couple’s domestic violence case — Ms. Sabae filed for a protection-from-abuse order, alleging that he struck her in the face with a bag full of cans at a Wal-Mart when she asked if she could help him, didn’t allow her to have friends, and “used sex as a way to threaten me about my green card.” Mr. Cwiklinski told his evaluator a different story, that he had “turned around with a bag in my hand, and I hit her, and she thought I was hitting her on purpose,” Mr. Adams said. “He was playing it as if it was a misunderstanding, and he seemed sincere. I didn’t know him well enough to know that he was sincere or not.” Earlier this year, prosecutors agreed to withdraw a simple assault charge and allow Mr. Cwiklinski to plead guilty to summary harassment. He had to attend 16 anger management sessions, which he completed, and undergo a mental health evaluation. Mr. Adams said he might have spent two sessions speaking with Mr. Cwiklinski before writing his report. He said he did nothing to verify any of the information Mr. Cwiklinski provided, assuming that if the court found any discrepancies he would be notified. “He just called up one day and said he needed an evaluation,” Mr. Adams recalled, adding that he never anticipated that Mr. Cwiklinski would end up as a killer. “I was surprised. I never would have seen that outcome coming,” Mr. Adams said. “I never would have expected the level of craziness.” Mr. Cwiklinski told Mr. Adams that he was the youngest of three children and came from an intact family. The counselor noted, “Childhood was emotionally and economically supportive and maritally intact.” Mr. Cwiklinski described himself as a community college dropout and self-taught machinist who worked at the same place for 28 years. Representatives for Tygard Machine & Manufacturing Co., where Mr. Cwiklinski was employed until recently, could not be reached for comment. His evaluation indicated that anger occasionally bubbled over, even in the workplace. “Mr. Cwiklinski has exhibited periodic anger problems. His anger manifests itself in aggressive but non-violent ways. He uses harsh and angry words. Angry verbal outbursts have been reported,” Mr. Adams wrote. “Loss of control of Mr. Cwilinski’s anger is an occasional occurrence. His anger passes quickly, in minutes. Marital difficulties have been caused by his anger. His anger has interfered with his occupational functioning on one occasion.” Mr. Adams’ report notes that Mr. Cwiklinski said he had been in combat, saw mutilated bodies and saw people “dying or being killed.” But there are no details about the combat experience. Records show that Mr. Cwiklinski was in the Army and the Army Reserve from December 1986 to October 1994, including during the Persian Gulf War. He was a heavy-wheel vehicle mechanic who received decorations consistent with having served during a period of combat while Operation Desert Storm was underway. But the only information in the public record shows only a 17-month deployment to South Korea just before his discharge. Mr. Cwiklinski joined the Army as specialist but left as a private, a lower grade. His evaluation indicates he received a general discharge, and information released by the Army related to his departure was redacted. Ms. Sabae indicated in her applications for restraining orders that she did not think her husband had weapons, although as far back as 1994 court records show he carried a Sig Sauer 9 mm pistol. Other than saying that Officer Saieva was shot with a rifle, police have not disclosed what type of gun was used last week, to whom it belonged, how Mr. Cwiklinski got it or whether he had it at the time his wife sought protection. Although cooperative, calm and friendly in person at his evaluation sessions, Mr. Cwilinski “had a way of explaining things away,” Mr. Adams said. “He came to a couple of sessions,” Mr. Adams said, “and when I started to push a little bit, he stopped coming.” Jonathan D.

This will put the customer in a position to deal with less traffic, have better choice of spaces and lower risk of collision. • Customers should be aware of their surroundings while parking and look out for small cars, children and pedestrians. • Avoid parking parking between two cars, which can make it hard to see when backing out. • Vehicles should be parked in well lit areas, and drivers should have their keys ready when approaching their vehicle. • All purchases and valuables should be stored in the trunk. Source: AAA Texas Shopping tips Advertisers often use the terms such as "sales" and "lowest price." Sales should be a limited time and have a significant reduction in the retailer's price on an item. Lowest price fluctuates and is hard for customers to compare, so make sure the retailer has evidence their price is the lowest. Be aware and understand asterisks and fine print on advertisements. Customers should make sure to take advertisements with them about the items they want to buy. Planning a budget helps customers track what they need and how much they want to spend. Be aware of the return policy for items purchased. Customers should also be cautious of the store credit card offers, which can often have high interest rates or expensive annual fees. Source: Better Business Bureau Black Friday is more than just a shopping spree for Krystal Hancock and her family. It's a long-standing family tradition. Hancock, along with her immediate and extended family, have been taking on Black Friday adventures for more than 20 years, she said. About 20 to 25 of four generations of women in the family, including Hancock's children and her grandmother, wear matching T-shirts as they search for all their Christmas gifts. The women gather after their Thanksgiving meals and make a game plan based on what they want, the advertisements for products and what times stores open, Hancock said. Black Friday gives her a chance to spend time with extended family she doesn't see often, she said. "When I moved out of state, that's something I could look forward to - Black Friday shopping," the 31-year-old Victoria native said. "As a big family, you have different Thanksgivings you have to go to. When we get together for Black Friday shopping, it is everyone. It consists of laughing, joking and telling stories. If you hadn't seen someone for a year or two, it is a way of catching up." To succeed during Black Friday shopping, research is essential, said Mary Hancock, Krystal Hancock's mother. While shopping, the family will have relatives stand in line with carts while others go out and find sale items, Mary Hancock said. Matching T-shirts makes the process easier, she said. "We're able to find our family members really fast," she said. "If we're looking for the basket with the teenagers, we're able to spot them in a crowd." Mary Hancock doesn't know yet what items she will hunt down, but she landed great deals last year, she said. She bought $100 worth of items from JCPenney for almost nothing with a $100 discount coupon. "Be patient and don't forget to have fun," she said. Because stores have started opening on Thanksgiving Day for Black Friday sales, the family heads out to Wal-Mart first on Thursday and then hits the mall. After shopping at the mall, some family members go home to sleep while others shop through the night, Krystal Hancock said. Wal-Mart opens at 6 p.m. Thursday as well as many stores in the Victoria Mall. Managers at Kohl's in Victoria are preparing for Black Friday sales by making sure the store is overstaffed for Thanksgiving and Black Friday and organizing extra merchandise, said Troyleen Roberson, Koh's administrator. On a regular day, Koh's will staff about 70 employees, but on Thanksgiving and Black Friday about 130 employees will work. Black Friday shopping benefits customers because they are often able to purchase items for less than 50 percent of the original cost, Roberson said. Kohl's opens 6 p.m. Thursday for the third year in a row. Previously the store would open early in the morning on Black Friday. The extended hours into Thanksgiving help employees manage the large sale crowds and makes it easier on customers, she said. "Before, we basically had to have security because managing the crowds were so bad," she said. "Now, we still have lines but it gives a bigger window of opportunity to shop, and it's not all at once." During the 10 years Roberson has worked at Kohl's, she noticed that many families make Black Friday shopping an extension of their Thanksgiving holiday. "We have a lot of ladies that come in all times of the night in teams, and they just love shopping together," Roberson said. "It seems like a great experience." The most popular items at Kohl's during Black Friday sales are small electric appliances and gaming systems, Roberson said. Many people will buy online for Black Friday sales and pick up their items at their chosen Koohkl's location, Roberson said. Customers can start buying items online Monday and pick them up when the store opens for sales. Jade and Madalynn Bridal Boutique will have a Black Friday sale for the first time since it has been open for nine years, said manager Erika Olguin. From 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Friday all gowns in the store will be 40 percent off, and Black Friday hours will be 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. "It'll be fun to have one; it will be a new experience," she said. "Everyone is going to be shopping and looking for deals, so this will help get the name out more."

"We have too many retailers. Some are hanging on by a thread. Some simply aren't needed. Some seem atavistic and antediluvian and they are just waiting to be destroyed by Amazon. Then we have other retailers that could be saved by the, well, Trump," the "Mad Money" host said. With the drastic difference in retail options ahead of Black Friday, Cramer reviewed the trends and how the market has reacted to them. Shares of Macy's, Kohl's and Nordstrom have all done well since the election. Cramer speculated this is due to anticipated tax cuts that the Republicans will create, which will mean more cash for shoppers. Oli Scarff | Getty Images Cramer was also impressed by J.C. Penney, whose stock rose despite the fact that it reported mediocre numbers and slashed guidance. This was a reflection of the optimism in the stock market. Home Depot pulled ahead of Lowe's, and Cramer was "aghast" at how much stronger Home Depot has performed on all levels, especially the big ticket appliances. He believes Home Depot has a better idea of what customers want right now. Cramer picked Target over Wal-Mart, as well. Target put up stellar numbers and indicated a robust back-to-school and upcoming holiday season. Next week, Dollar Tree will report and Cramer will compare the numbers versus Wal-Mart, TJX and Ross Stores, where he thinks the growth was tremendous. Ross Stores confirmed Cramer's thesis that discount stores would have full priced merchandise because of the disarray from broad line retailers like Macy's. Sporting goods were a mixed bag, as Foot Locker seemed to benefit from the sneaker war going on. Dick's Sporting Goods also reported good numbers, thanks to Sports Authority closing. One pleasant surprise for Cramer was Best Buy, which was supposed to be hurt by Amazon by now. "This stock is back to its just won't quit days, although it did have a refreshing pullback today," Cramer said. The retailers in the mall were truly sad, with only one shining star. The biggest losers were Gap Stores and Abercrombie. Williams Sonoma saw a surprising 4.5 percent decline at its Pottery Barn brand. The one place that could have a comeback in sight is L Brands, as Amazon couldn't replicate Bath & Body Works and Pink has been strong. The problem was Victoria's Secret, Cramer said. He thinks management is addressing the issues. The new winner of the mall was Children's Place, which reported an amazing quarter. The stock rallied in response. "Children's Place … has cracked the code and is winning both online and off. It's pure execution: the right styles and the right sizes. The Childrens Place is the NVIDIA of retail and a reminder that not only is the mall not dead, but you can make a ton of money in it if you have the right stuff," Cramer said. Questions for Cramer?

But it turns out that’s a feature built into iOS and macOS for the user’s “convenience.” So there’s no point freaking out about it. That said, Apple could certainly have done a better job informing the user what happens with call data. DON’T MISS: All the best pre-Black Friday deals you can buy right now at Walmart, Best Buy and Amazon If you’ve got iCloud enabled on your Apple devices, and most people do, then Apple will record data from all your calls, whether it’s a regular phone call or VoIP-based calls including FaceTime, Skype, WhatsApp, Viber and others. Everything gets synced to the cloud, complete with phone numbers, call dates and times, and call duration. The reasoning here is pretty simple. Apple wants you to be able to access those calls and return missed calls from any of your devices. This is possible through Apple’s Continuity feature. The actual contents of a call aren’t saved in iCloud. After all, Apple doesn’t listen in on your conversations. However, the worry with some people is that the data stored in iCloud can be decrypted by Apple, and can be shared with law enforcement if a warrant requires Apple to do so. Hackers might also access call history, and Elcomsoft updated its Phone Breaker software to extract call records from iCloud using only an authentication token for an account from a computer belonging to the account holder. To make those call records disappear, you have to delete them from a device. Otherwise, they’ll remain in iCloud for up to four months. FaceTime call invitations can be stored for up to 30 days. “We offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices,” an Apple spokesperson said about the matter. “Device data is encrypted with a user’s passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user’s Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.” MacRumors notes that while Apple may not explain exactly what happens in the background, it does state that it collects call history for iCloud backups in a 63-page white paper about iOS security.

LUCIE — When Ylovy Fleurant moved his family to the U.S., he said, he wanted to get them away from killings in Haiti. “I came here for a better life,” Ylovy Fleurant said. “I didn’t bring my son here to get killed.” Ylovy Fleurant said he was in shock Friday night as he stood beyond the yellow crime scene tape surrounding his Port St. Lucie home after his 25-year-old son, Samson Fleurant, was fatally shot that afternoon by a police officer. While Ylovy Fleurant was at work, a family member at his home in the 600 block of Southwest Colleen Avenue called 911 about 2:15 p.m. to report a person, later identified as his son, was cutting up the house with a knife, Police Chief John Bolduc said. Officers arrived and found Samson Fleurant armed with a machete, Bolduc said. He then charged at the officers. Officer Kenneth Frid tried to stop Samson Fleurant with a Taser, Bolduc said, but it didn’t work. When Samson Fleurant continued with the machete toward them, Bolduc said, K-9 Officer Colin Duncombe shot him. Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Port St. Lucie Police Chief John Bolduc talks about the officer-involved shooting in Port St. Lucie on Friday. NICHOLAS SAMUEL/TREASURE COAST NEWSPAPERS Josue Maury, who lives nearby, said he drove by the house and saw officers around a man who appeared to be unarmed lying motionless on the grass in front of the home. Maury said officers told him to keep driving. Samson Fleurant was taken to Lawnwood Regional Medical Center & Heart Institute in Fort Pierce, where he died. It's unknown how many times Samson Fleurant was shot or whether drugs were a factor in the incident, Bolduc said. Florida Department of Law Enforcement officials were taking over the investigation, which is typical for officer-involved shootings. Ylovy Fleurant said what officials have told him of the incident doesn’t sound like his son. He said he had a nice son who never gave him trouble in 25 years. “My son is not a bad guy,” Ylovy Fleurant said. “He’s a cool guy.” When Samson Fleurant wasn’t working 12- to 13-hour shifts at Wal-Mart to pay for college or going to church on Sundays, he would watch TV at home, said his father. Family members console each other near the scene where 25-year-old Samson Fleurant, accused of approaching police with a machete, was fatally shot at his residence by a Port St. Lucie police officer Friday, Nov. 18, 2016, after a domestic disturbance call to the home on the 600 block of Southwest Colleen Avenue in Port St. Lucie.  (Photo: XAVIER MASCAREÑAS/TREASURE COAST NEWSPAPERS) Ylovy Fleurant said he didn’t know what happened inside his home Friday afternoon because he was working at the time. He came home after work to find police officers had blocked off a large area surrounding his home and learned somebody had been shot. He said he became emotional when he found out it was his son. He said his wife wasn’t home either because she also was at work. When she got to the house and learned about her son, she sobbed in front of their home. It’s unknown who inside the house called 911, but Ylovy Fleurant said his three daughters were home with his son at the time of the disturbance. He said the 3- to 4-foot machete was used only to cut meat and never as a weapon. Samson Fleurant had no criminal history in Florida, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. A check of court records in Martin, St. Lucie and Indian River counties also show he has no traffic infractions or civil actions filed against him. Ylovy Fleurant said he’s lived in the area for 25 years — two years in the Port St. Lucie home and Fort Pierce before that. He said he’s a pastor at the Fort Pierce Wesleyan Church. Even though he became a U.S. citizen in 2006, he said, he regrets that now. Ylovy Fleurant said he doesn’t understand how someone without a gun could be shot, and he doesn’t think the shooting was justified. Not only are law enforcement officials biased against black people, he said, they need more training.

NICHOLAS SAMUEL/TREASURE COAST NEWSPAPERS Duncombe, who shot Samson Fleurant, is a 47-year-old black officer who has been with the Police Department for 18 years, said police spokesman Master Sgt. Frank Sabol. Frid, who used the Taser, is a 47-year-old white officer with 11 years of service. Sgt. Tara Pavlyshin, a 44-year-old white officer with 15 years of service, was the supervisor on scene, Sabol said. Lt. Leo Niemczyk, a 47-year-old white officer with 14 years of service, was the district commander on scene. All four officers had been placed on paid administrative leave while the investigation is ongoing, Bolduc said. If the officers were lying about what Samson Fleurant son did, said his father, God will judge them in the end. “God is a powerful God; he will deal with it,” Ylovy Fleurant said. “My son will have justice.” Reporter Melissa E.

The Alexandria gang seemed utterly unprepared to deal with Negan’s arrival, even though they all knew he was coming to collect his protection tax. That said, there was a moment in the episode almost everyone missed that might make Daryl great again. And with him, the entire season. Beware, spoilers follow below. DON’T MISS: All the best pre-Black Friday deals you can buy right now at Walmart, Best Buy and Amazon There’s one scene in episode four where Daryl blinks strangely, and the camera focuses on him. The easiest interpretation for his blinking (see GIF below) is that he’s readjusting to the sunlight, considering that he spends most of the time in darkness. daryl-morse-codeMore But, as Business Insider explains, Daryl might be communicating in Morse code with Rick. He might be telling him either “I East,” or “HT” for Hilltop. Aside from that blinking sequence, Daryl chooses not to speak, or he’s not allowed to. Negan explicitly forbids Rick from talking to Daryl. But a tracker and hunter like Daryl might be able to find a way to communicate without Negan realizing. That “I East” indication would be enough for Rick & Co to know where to look for Negan’s base, since the location of the Saviors’ hometown isn’t known yet. The fact that Daryl would want to communicate with Rick in such a manner could show that he has not been broken. He may be riddled with guilt after causing Glenn’s death, not to mention he now believes that Maggie may have died as well. But he did not give in. We also know he’s not willing to say his name is Negan now, as he refuses to take Dwight up on his offer at the end of the episode — just a word (Negan) is needed for Daryl to get his bike back. A Daryl who wants to fight back and who wants to keep in contact with Rick is a dangerous Daryl. At least for Negan and his men. Is this all wishful thinking? It might very well be. But then why is there a scene in the same episode that shows a Morse code alphabet hanging on a wall in Rick and Michonne’s home? Surely, Rick and the gang may have figured out that such a means of communication might come in handy in dangerous situations such as the Negan crisis. We’ll have to wait for the next episodes of The Walking Dead to see whether Daryl was indeed talking to Rick.

Follow TechnoBuffalo If you don’t own a Roku, there’s no better time to get in on the streaming product everyone loves. Roku recently sent us an email with all of its Black Friday deals ahead of time, and where you’ll be able to find each product. There may be more from additional retailers in the future, so we’ll let you know if those pop up, but here’s a taste of what to expect. Beginning on November 20, Best Buy will sell the Roku Streaming Stick for $35.99, down from the standard price of $49.99.  Best Buy will also sell the Roku 3 for $49.99, down from $99.99. Beginning on November 24, Walmart will sell the Roku Express+ for $25, down from the standard price of $39.99. This is probably the best option for folks who want to try Roku but aren’t yet sure if they want to cut the cord, since it’s the most affordable option. On November 21, Kohl’s will sell the Roku 2 for $44.99, down from the standard $59.99 price the retailer usually sells it for. Some of these aren’t the newest Roku players Keep in mind that Roku recently refreshed its portfolio with new 4K-ready products. The Roku Express+ is the newest and cheapest out of all of the products on sale for Black Friday, but the discounts on products like the Roku 3, a great product, are worth the fact that you’re buying a generation-old product. If you want the newest, look for the company’s new Premiere-branded products.

Amazon and Walmart are probably the two most popular stores who are treating their customers to early savings, but Sam’s Club has also been one of the more active retailers. Last week, they held their annual one-day sale on November 12, which featured Black Friday prices on a variety of electronics and home items. While Sam’s Club’s official general pre-Black Friday event does not begin until Sunday, they are actually kicking things off early with a selection of electronics deals from premium manufacturer Samsung. The sale begins online at 12:01 a.m. tonight, and traditional brick-and-mortar locations will open at 7 a.m. A full listing of the sale items can be found at BestBlackFriday.com, but here are the top deals from the ad.

[Image by Sam’s Club] As the screenshot shows, this sale is entirely made up of Samsung items. While a single-item sale is usually not newsworthy, Samsung is probably the most common brand for electronics deals on Black Friday. Select items actually offer better discounts than Black Friday, so it could make sense to purchase them a week earlier in order to avoid the rush. Par for the course with Sam’s Club, limited quantities are available on every item, and there are no rain checks. 10.1″ Samsung Galaxy Tab A w/Free 32GB MicroSD Card for $188.84 (reg. $288.84) 8″ Samsung Galaxy Tab A w/Free Pouch for $118.24 (reg. $188.88) Samsung 2.1 Soundbar with Wireless Subwoofer for $139.88 (reg. $199.88) Samsung 24″ Class 720p TV form $98.88 (reg. $138.88) Samsung 27″ Curved 1080p Monitor for $169 (reg $249) Samsung 40″ Class 1080p Smart TV for $238 (reg. $328) Samsung 4k Blu-ray Disc Player for $189.88 Samsung 55″ Class 4K SUHD HDR Smart TV for $978 (reg. $1,378) Samsung 55″ Class 4K UDH Curved Smart TV + Samsung 2.1 Curved Soundbar w/Wireless Subwoofer for $698 (reg. $1,099) Samsung 70″ Class 4K UHD Smart TV + $150 Gift Card for $1,248 Samsung 8-Channel 1080p HD Security System with 1TB Hard Drive for $199 (reg. $299) Samsung Blu-ray Disc Player for $44.88 (reg. $64.88) Samsung Level U Pro Wireless Headphones for $39.88 (reg. $99.99) Samsung Radiant Connect Speaker for $79.88 (reg. $129.88) Forget Black Friday, Sam’s Club has a serious one-day sales event this Saturday https://t.co/mTy28wXNCU — David Papp (@DavidPapp) November 16, 2016 Shipping Options Unlike other retailers, Sam’s Club does not have a general rule for shipping. Certain expensive items may incur shipping charges, while select cheap items may ship for free. The good news is that the majority of the items in this sale will ship for free. As a general rule, paying shipping charges on any Black Friday, Cyber Monday, or Thanksgiving sale is unnecessary. Many retailers, including Best Buy and Target, are offering free shipping on every order with no minimum this holiday season. Seeing as most Samsung deals are going to be over $50, the majority will qualify for free shipping. If you come across one that does not, you should look elsewhere because shipping charges can drastically reduce an otherwise great deal. Comparisons to Black Friday Unlike in this sale, Sam’s Club is not offering many Samsung televisions on Black Friday. The closest comparison for televisions is the Samsung 75″ 4K UHD Smart TV (UN75JU641DFXZA) for $1,998 on Black Friday. Tonight’s sale has a Samsung 70″ Class 4K UHD Smart TV + $150 gift card for $1,248. While these are not the same television, they are still fairly comparable. By shopping tonight’s sale, you can pay more than $700 less, and you will also receive a Sam’s Club gift card valued at $150. Tonight’s sale also features the 10.1″ Samsung Galaxy Tab A with a free 32GB MicroSD Card for $188.84, which is a savings of $100. On Black Friday, Sam’s Club will have the same exact deal, so this is an opportunity to get it early. Comparisons to Walmart and Amazon Pre-Black Friday Sales As Amazon announced in a press release earlier this week, they started their “Black Friday Deals Week” sale earlier today. Many of the Samsung televisions are still a few days away, but Amazon claims the “lowest prices on select Samsung TVs.” One deal that is live now is the Samsung UN65KS8500 Curved 65-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV for $1,597.99, which is a discount of $400. The closest comparable deal is the one mentioned above — the Samsung 70″ Class 4K UHD Smart TV + $150 gift card for $1,248. While there are differences among both televisions, you can get a set that is five inches larger for more than $300 less. For the average viewer, the difference in quality should be fairly negligible. Walmart’s pre-Black Friday sale is loaded with Samsung televisions. They are offering the Samsung 40″ 6200 Series Full HD Smart LED TV for $227, which is a discount of $522.99. Sam’s Club’s sale is featuring a Samsung 40″ Class 1080p Smart TV for $238, which is a discount of $90. In this instance, you can get a more expensive Samsung TV at Walmart and pay $11 less. Regardless, this sale still has prices that are very comparable to what you will see on Black Friday. The popular opinion is that Black Friday and Cyber Monday are the best days of the year to get a deal, but careful planning can net you prices just as good by shopping a few days earlier.

Politics can outrun earnings on Monday if Trump names Mitt Romney as secretary of state, Cramer said. The pair is meeting on Saturday, and while a source close to Trump told NBC News that they will discuss the top diplomat position, there's no indication yet that Trump will offer it or that Romney will accept it. The market may rally on the perception that Trump is savvier about foreign policy than some people thought. "A name-brand Wall Street friendly Treasury secretary on top of tabbing Romney for state would send this market through the roof, that is if there even is a roof," the "Mad Money" host said. With this in mind, Cramer outlined the stocks and events on his radar for next week: Monday: Tyson Foods, Jack in the Box Tyson Foods has transformed itself from a commodity chicken producer into packaged foods, thanks to its acquisition of Hillshire Brands two years ago. While Cramer expects earnings growth to be good, he fears Tyson could fall behind the competition if the economy speeds up. Jack in the Box will be the real test of Cramer's theory that people will dine out more after the election. Tuesday: Burlington Stores, Dollar Tree, Campbell Soup, Analog Devices, Tech Data Dollar Tree was crushed last time around because of the newly organized Wal-Mart. This will be a tough call for Cramer, as Wal-Mart is still aggressive. Campbell Soup was also pounded on weak numbers in its last quarter. Cramer is concerned that there will be nothing to write home about for this quarter. Analog Devices and Tech Data could be the stars of technology when they report, Cramer said. They have both made brilliant acquisitions lately and had good numbers even before then. He anticipates the mergers will allow the companies to stay strong in 2017. "We are still in the throes of Donald Trump's victory and an errant Cabinet pick could send us lower," Cramer said. "But if he announces some experience hands at State and Treasury this weekend, then it might not matter what earnings we get." Questions for Cramer?

Trump University $25 Million Deal Heads Off Fraud Trial Vilsack Wake-Up Call To Democrats: Ignore Rural Voters and Lose Trump’s Pick for Attorney General Scoffed at ‘Too Big to Fail’ Tom Schoenberg Tschoenberg22 November 18, 2016 — 5:41 PM EST Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mail Sessions’s remarks on BP probe hint at approach to companies ‘I was taught, if they violated the law, you charge them’ Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mail Senator Jeff Sessions, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for attorney general, doesn’t have a record of going after big business, but he has signaled that he’s willing to be tough on malfeasance, even when it involves some of the world’s largest corporations. While clues to his outlook on how to punish Wall Street and corporate misconduct are thin, the former federal prosecutor from Alabama indicated at a Senate hearing six years ago that he wouldn’t back away from charging a major company if there was evidence of criminal conduct. Jeff Sessions Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg “I was taught, if they violated the law, you charge them. If they did not violate the law, you do not charge them,” Sessions said during a 2010 confirmation hearing for former Deputy Attorney General James Cole. He made the comments in reference to the Justice Department’s investigation into BP Plc over the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Sessions expressed concern that the department might refrain from prosecuting the company because it was worried that a criminal charge could cause wider harm to innocent people after the collapse of Arthur Andersen LLP, which was indicted by the U.S. for destroying documents related to the Enron Corp. case in 2002. "I have said repeatedly that BP is liable and should be held liable for their responsibilities to the extent of their existence," Sessions said at the hearing. "In other words, they are not too big to fail." BP eventually paid out about $25 billion to resolve civil and criminal claims related to the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion, including $4 billion as part of a guilty plea in 2012. Corporate Crime What impact Sessions will have on numerous open investigations into corporate crime, Wall Street corruption and business mega-mergers that will carry over into the new administration remains an open question. A member of the Senate’s Judiciary Committee, Sessions has weighed in on numerous Justice Department appointees and federal judges, as well as law enforcement policies. But his views on terrorism, drugs and immigration are far better known than his attitudes toward corporate enforcement. Outstanding matters he may influence include years-long probes into alleged rigging of currency and other financial benchmarks by bank traders, a criminal investigation into price fixing of generic drugs and civil inquiries into the packaging and sale of mortgage-backed securities by banks in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis.  The Justice Department is also said to be assessing how big a criminal fine it can extract from Volkswagen AG over emissions-cheating without putting the German carmaker out of business, while Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is trying to wrap up a long-running foreign corruption investigation. Both of those cases are being handled by the Justice Department’s criminal division, which has taken the lead on the most sophisticated and wide-ranging corporate prosecutions, according to James Koukios, a former federal prosecutor now at Morrison & Foerster LLP in Washington. ‘Extremely Influential’ The appointee to head the criminal division could play a critical role in how those cases are resolved and which new ones are brought, Koukios said. “Given that Sessions has been so focused apparently on blue-collar crime it really could leave the door open for the head of the criminal division to be extremely influential,” Koukios. Session’s priorities will likely include terrorism financing and anti-money laundering, as well as cybercrime and the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, said George Stamboulidis, a former federal prosecutor who worked in the Justice Department for a dozen years. He said fraud and corruption prosecutions will continue no matter what party is in the White House. "Some of most famous prosecutions under the Enron era took place under a Republican-appointed attorney general with line prosecutors and supervisors who today serve as senior officials in the Obama Justice Department," said Stamboulidis, now a partner at BakerHostetler in New York. The 69-year-old, four-term Alabama Republican is a hard-liner on free trade and immigration, arguing that prospective immigrants don’t have constitutional protections. He has opposed efforts to overhaul prison sentencing, back off the war on drugs and legalize marijuana. Sessions, who was U.S. attorney in Alabama from 1981 to 1983 and Alabama attorney general in 1994, was one of the few lawmakers to defend Trump after he proposed a complete shutdown on Muslims entering the U.S. Thin Record While on the Judiciary Committee, Sessions hasn’t played a big role in the committee’s oversight of antitrust enforcement. He asked no questions of the past two chiefs of the antitrust division during their Senate confirmation hearings, according to transcripts. Sessions also didn’t participate in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in September 2010 on prosecuting financial fraud or an oversight hearing of the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force in 2011.   The Chamber of Commerce didn’t offer any specific reaction to his selection for attorney general, other than saying the group looks forward to working with all of Trump’s appointees.    The Justice Department has come under criticism in recent years for the deferred- and non-prosecution agreements it has reached with banks; lawmakers and other critics say the deals weren’t an adequate deterrent. The government counters that the agreements lead to oversight and cooperation that otherwise wouldn’t be possible. In his 2010 exchange with Cole, who had been nominated for the department’s No. 2 position under former Attorney General Eric Holder, Sessions acknowledged the failure of Arthur Andersen may have inhibited the department from indicting other companies for wrongdoing, but suggested that Cole’s views risked "picking winners and losers." Sessions said with this view, the government risked overreaching on the one hand by seeking high penalties that might not be entirely justified, while on the other it risked stopping short of issuing an indictment that was supported by the facts. Cole’s position "seems to go beyond strict enforcement of the law and try to preserve corporations who perhaps should be charged and suffer whatever consequences might result from their criminal acts," Sessions said.

'The difference between genius and stupidity is genius has its limits.' - Albert Einstein Home Articles Authors Email Groups Search About Us HOME / Articles / Mike Shedlock / Inventory to Sales Ratios: What's Really Going On?... Inventory to Sales Ratios: What's Really Going On? By: Mike Shedlock | Fri, Nov 18, 2016 Share Print Email On November 15, the Census Bureau released its monthly report on Manufacturing and Trade Inventories and Sales. Despite the fact that is it mid-November, we are just now getting data for September. The census bureau headline reads "total business inventories/sales ratio based on seasonally adjusted data at the end of September was 1.38." That's a decline of 0.1 percentage points. I went back through a number of charts to highlight major flaws inherent in superficial reporting on headline numbers. Bloomberg Econoday saw things this way: "Inventories proved tame in September, rising only 0.1 percent against a sharp 0.7 percent gain in sales that pulls the inventory-to-sales ratio one notch leaner to 1.38 from 1.39. High levels of inventories were a concern going into the fourth quarter but this morning's very strong retail sales report may in fact point to the need to build inventories further." The Census Bureau posted this chart. The above chart certainly does not reflect any need to build inventories. Here are some charts I produced from Fred, the St; Louis Fed data repository. Total Business Inventory-to-Sales Manufacturers Inventory-to-Sales Retailers Inventory-to-Sales Auto Inventory-to-Sales Merchant Wholesalers Inventory-to-Sales Apparel Inventory-to-Shipments Fred did not have inventory-to-sales for apparel so I substituted shipments. What is Normal? In my first chart I asked "Is this is normal?" three times. However, "normal" is not a constant, and it varies sector by sector. Take autos for example. The distribution mechanism and the way autos are purchased has not changed in decades. Manufacturers ship autos to dealers. People buy autos from dealers. Dealers hold acres of cars. The auto inventory-to-sales ratio is the least volatile in the group simply because the auto business has not changed. The number of auto dealers has not skyrocketed like the number of Wal-Mart stores. The number of US auto manufacturers changes very little over very lengthy periods of time. Tesla style direct sales may change things in the future, but for now Tesla is a minor player. Manufacturers vs. Retailers Manufacturer inventory-to-sales ratio bottomed in December of 2005 at 1.14. Retailers inventory-to-sales ratio bottomed over six years later in March of 2012 at 1.34. Total inventory-to-sales ratio bottomed in March of 2011 at 1.24. What's Going On? Manufacturing inventory-to sales is a reflection of just-in-time production and delivery coupled with a more stable influence of autos. Retailer inventory-to-sales is a reflection on a huge move towards online shopping and a massive buildup of new retail stores despite the clear shift towards online shopping. Since auto sales are the biggest component of retail sales, the total inventory-to-sales ratio looks very peculiar. Here is the answer to the "Is this normal?" question in my first chart: One simply cannot analyze inventories in an aggregate fashion this way. A single chart does not provide enough information. Ominous Charts Individually, we can analyze the charts. They mostly look ominous. Despite record auto sales that realistically have little room to go anywhere but down, the auto inventory-to-sales ratio is at the top end of the range. Retailers have over-expanded in an economy that has clearly shifted away from big box stores to online delivery. The manufacturers chart is skewed because manufacturing includes autos. Merchant wholesalers looks downright scary. Manufacturers are not going back to 1995 levels of inventory-to-sales except via a recessionary spike. The same applies autos. Trends in online shopping suggest retailers have much inventory shrinkage to do. I expect more retail store closings and fewer new stores in the coming years. Retail stores add inventory and huge numbers of jobs. Where will job growth come from? 2016 Inventory Crisis Talk of the need to build inventories is simply ridiculous. I discussed this previously in Inventory Crisis: Can Parrots Read Charts? SupplyChain247 commented "These days, flexibility is best guaranteed through supply chain network technology. Nordstrom recently acquired a minority stake in DS Co., a cloud-based supply chain software firm. The motivation behind the purchase was to make direct shipments from vendors to customers much easier. Direct shipments are a clever way of reducing inventory burdens." Factor in the strong likelihood of global trade wars and the above inventory charts look worse than simply ominous.

Burning Down The Mall Because You Can’t Find A Shopping Cart Joins Long List Of Customer Overreactions Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Burning Down The Mall Because You Can’t Find A Shopping Cart Joins Long List Of Customer Overreactions Image courtesy of Kent Regional Fire Authority November 18, 2016 3:53 pm EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk well that seems excessive bad consumers overreactions shopping retail customer service fast food When you’ve been wronged by a business — or believe you have been — there are two ways you can try to resolve the situation: one, you can take a deep breath and calmly address the issue at hand by using your words; or, you can go the opposite route and overreact completely, and woe betide the poor mortals caught in your way. Police in Kent, WA say a woman who was upset about the lack of shopping carts set fire to a strip mall last Sunday, causing a three-alarm blaze that took 75 firefighters 24 hours to put out, KOMO News reports. According to court documents, the woman charged with sparking the fire mentioned to a Dollar Tree employee that there weren’t any carts, and said she’d be taking her business elsewhere. She left, then returned and said something about “burning the store down,” authorities said. She made a trip to the greeting card aisle and then alerted employees, “The store is on fire.” Store workers tried to extinguish the fire but were unsuccessful, and it spread from there to five businesses nearby. Prosecutors charged her on Wednesday with first-degree arson. The suspect is far from alone in having an extreme reaction in a situation that doesn’t quite merit such an outsized response. And when we say far, we mean, there’s a huge long list of these kinds of situations in just the past few years: • The Taco Bell customer who allegedly shot at a store over forgotten sour cream • A Wendy’s patron who police said trashed the restaurant because she was dissatisfied with her order • An incident in France where an Apple store customer smashed up the store because the company wouldn’t replace his defective iPhone • The accused shoplifter who bit off the finger of the Walmart worker who confronted her for stealing • Drive-thru customers who allegedly attacked a Burger King worker because their order wasn’t ready fast enough • An angry Wendy’s customer who was arrested for biting a manager because of a mixup in her order • The all-out brawl at a pizzeria that police said was caused by unwanted cheese on a customer’s order of garlic knots • A New York City bus passenger who was arrested for hijacking the bus after the driver told her to stop smoking on it • The guy who was accused of slashing a Dunkin’ Donuts worker in the face after being asked to leave the store • A McDonald’s customer who ended up in a tie-grabbing, right-hook flying kerfuffle with a worker because he was tired of waiting for his change • The man who police said shattered a glass door at Waffle House because he was cranky about his bill for sausage biscuits • A customer who was turned down for a loan who allegedly threatened a Kia dealership with a handgun • Yet another shoplifting suspect accused of biting someone; this time it was a Target security officer’s arm • The Macy’s customer who was accused of biting an employee in a dispute over a price • An unhappy Subway customer who hurled a sandwich and a soda at an employee and then allegedly tried to hit her with her car • The Taco Bell customers accused of walking into the restaurant after their drive-thru order was incorrect, and assaulting a fellow patron who stood up for staff with a tire iron • The guy who was so upset that his US Airways flight was overbooked, he stripped naked at the Charlotte Airport to show his displeasure • A man who police said pitched a condiment-throwing fit over a rest stop’s lack of macaroni and cheese and potatoes • Accused dine-and-dashers who allegedly ran over a waitress who was trying to confront them about their bill • The Pizza Hut customer who was apparently so mad that his order got lost, he allegedly drove his car into the restaurant • A Walmart customer who was caught on tape head-butting a tax worker during an argument in the store • The bodega customer who was accused of using a stolen credit card and then allegedly trying to set the clerk on fire with Axe body spray Want more stories from Consumerist?

One of the more notable lawsuits plaguing Trump during the recent election centered on his involvement with Trump University, a for-profit education company that promised to teach “students” the ins and outs of striking it rich in real estate via a smattering of online courses and seminars. DON’T MISS: All the best pre-Black Friday deals you can buy right now at Walmart, Best Buy and Amazon The lawsuits involving Trump University were varied in nature, with some alleging that the name itself constituted false advertising (it wasn’t technically a University) and others alleging fraud, with some specifically claiming that they were urged to go into credit card debt in order to pay for the seminars. Now comes word via Reuters that Trump has agreed to settle pending lawsuits involving Trump University for a cool $25 million. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has agreed to settle lawsuits relating to his Trump University series of real estate seminars for $25 million, a source familiar with the situation said on Friday. Claims brought by New York’s attorney general will represent roughly $4 million of that amount, the source said. The settlement amount is noteworthy in and of itself given Trump’s previous statements during the campaign that he could have easily settled the cases for very little money. “It’s something I could have settled many times,” Trump said not too long ago. “I could settle it right now for very little money, but I don’t want to do it out of principle.” During the campaign, Hillary Clinton often brought up Trump University as an example of Trump’s unscrupulous behavior. Another Trump University practice, according to its own employees: target struggling families to fleece them. pic.twitter.com/VUH18SpBlD — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 1, 2016 As an aside, this CNN interview with a former Trump University instructor is worth taking a look at.

But last night’s premiere really did confirm that it’s really just Top Gear with a more international location, the same jokes, and a whole lot more money. DON’T MISS: All the best pre-Black Friday deals you can buy right now at Walmart, Best Buy and Amazon On the surface, enough things are different to Top Gear to satisfy the BBC’s lawyers. The show doesn’t have one fixed studio location; rather, it has a big tent, which it moves around from location to location every week. The first place it visits is a California desert, though, which is about as different to Top Gear‘s studio on a rainy airfield in England as you can imagine. The first episode opened more or less as you’d imagine: a short intro film in which Clarkson is shown running, tail between legs, from his old job at the BBC. It segues neatly into all the presenters getting on stage in front of adoring fans, and then it’s mostly business as usual. Three men sitting in chairs cracking jokes, occasionally interspersed with car films. For the first episode, The Grand Tour seems to go out of its way to emphasize that it’s going to be the best motoring show on the planet, not just a sitcom with a bunch of middle-age men. The team lined up a three-way battle between the McLaren P1, Porsche 918 Spyder, and the Ferrari LaFerrari. It’s a real battle for the ages, and the presenters dedicated pretty much the entire episode to thrashing all three cars around a track. It’s a far cry from what Top Gear was doing shortly before Clarkson had left. There was a lack of gratuitous stunts in these films, and it stays much closer to the motoring-show roots. The end result is a show that’s not quite serious, still like crack to car enthusiasts, and good enough to convince me to sign up for a Prime membership. Well played, Amazon.

The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that today, the Road Team captains are busier than ever, with events and presentations almost every week and no signs of gearing down. The program is modeled after the America’s Road Team founded by the American Trucking Associations in 1986. Companies nominate outstanding drivers that have stellar safety records for participation and agree to pay the drivers for the few days per month that they spend with the program. But, as Gary Mars, a Road Team captain and Wal-Mart Transportation driver, said: “I love doing it. I’d do it for free.” The association’s safety program, including the Road Team, was funded by a grant through the state Highway and Transportation Department, called the Arkansas Commercial Truck Safety and Education Program. “We had to make a commitment as a company that this is something we’re going to support,” explained Tanya Rogers, safety manager at USA Truck in Van Buren. “It does create a little bit of a problem with revenue, but I think the benefits really outweigh that.” USA Truck has two drivers on the team: April Coolidge and Tom Miller. The Road Team captains, as the drivers are called, give safety presentations at schools and events around the state about how to safely pass tractor trailers on the roadways and how to avoid the truck drivers’ four blind spots. They also offer people the chance to sit in an 18-wheeler to see those blind spots for themselves. Also, distracted driving and drivers texting have become central topics of Road Team presentations. “It needs to be a big part of the presentations now because distracted driving is the No. 1 killer of 18- and 19-year-olds,” Mars said. “While Share the Road started nationally 30 years ago talking about how to drive safely around big trucks, out of necessity we and others have evolved our program into talking as much about distracted and aggressive driving as we do talking about driving around a big truck,” explained David O’Neal, safety director at the Arkansas Trucking Association and manager of the Arkansas Road Team. Road Team members set a cone 90 feet in front of a parked truck, so people can see just how far the vehicle will travel in one second at 55 mph. It takes three or four seconds to send a short text. The demonstration is one of the most powerful parts of the presentation, Mars said. At presentations, sometimes the drivers cover topics other than highway safety. “They’re ambassadors for the industry in one sense,” O’Neal said. “The majority of their time is spent talking about highway safety, but they also spread the good news of trucking to their audiences. As time permits and opportunities allow, they talk about what they do as drivers and what their industry does.” The national team, which started with four captains in 1986, now uses between 85 and 100 of its more than 400 “reserves” at events almost every day. Drivers on the team, just as in Arkansas, not only speak at schools, but to legislators about regulatory issues, and at fairs and community events about the profession in general. “We wanted to get out there and tell our story from a professional truck driver’s point of view. Those drivers on the road every day are obviously a more credible voice,” said Elisabeth Barna, chief operating officer and executive vice president of industry affairs at the American Trucking Associations. Barna runs the America’s Road Team program and explained that the association does not limit or dictate what the drivers say in any capacity. Several of the Arkansas drivers also have participated or continue to participate on the national team, and Larry Rhein of FedEx Freight was nominated for the national team this year. Decisions for participation will be made in January. Many companies, including ABF and Wal-Mart, also have their own road teams. “I think they’re really good representatives,” said Rogers of the Arkansas Road Team. “In trying to change the image of trucking, we want to put great faces of trucking and USA Truck out there in front of people.” All of the Road Team’s sponsoring companies report being “proud” and “honored” to have their drivers out as “ambassadors for safety on the road,” said John Smith, senior vice president of operations at FedEx Freight. “It’s really all about saving lives,” Barna said. “And Arkansas is doing a fantastic job with their program.” “I’m definitely going to drive more carefully now,” said Shawn Flores, a Rogers senior at Heritage High School, after seeing a presentation by Road Team captains Mars and Otto Schmeckenbecher. As Barna put it, “I always feel like just talking to one person can save a life.” Note: The above article is an AP Member Exchange shared by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

This year’s banquet, in honor of National Philanthropy Day, was the 26th year the event has been held in the Valley. Catherine Cala, director of alumni engagement at Youngstown State University and event co-chair, said a wide variety of businesses were represented. “Different types of nonprofits were represented, so we’re really proud of all the work they do and the fact that our community members care enough to recognize them,” she said. Receiving awards were: Outstanding Civic Organization – Youngstown CityScape Outstanding Corporate Philanthropist – Wal-Mart of Mahoning and Shenango Valleys Legacy Award – Irwin Thomases Outstanding Philanthropist – Herb and Gisele Washington Outstanding Small Business Philanthropist – Mr. Bob Komara, Komara Jewelers Outstanding Volunteer Fundraiser – Dorothy J. Pollock Outstanding Young Philanthropist – Kate Jenkins and Sarah O’Malley The Association of Fundraising Professionals represents more than 30,000 members in over 230 chapters throughout the world, working to advance philanthropy through advocacy, research, education and certification programs. Locally, the Mahoning/Shenango Chapter consists of 60 members who are active fundraising professionals for numerous nonprofit organizations, schools and hospitals. Along with Kate Jenkins, a junior at Canfield High School, Sarah O’Malley also received the Outstanding Young Philanthropist award. O’Malley is a graduate of Greenville High School and Westminster College. Jenkins discussed what she did to receive the award. “I sold some of my art and cards and we raised about $2,000 that way, and we got donations from the Junior Leagues of Women and from many other places,” Jenkins said. Her main goal was to form an art club for Canfield High School. The club is still going on and Jenkins hopes it continues after she graduates. “We have meetings. We just had a meeting yesterday. We’re currently doing a project, we’re painting aprons. You can paint Starry Night on an apron or a Monet painting on an apron,” Jenkins said. O’Malley is the one responsible for the Kindness Kampaign at Greenville High School, she was a co-founder when she attended the high school. “There was probably a group of eight or 10 students. We started it together after one of our friends passed away and we just thought that our community could use a little more kindness. That’s been our mission ever since and it’s been going on since 2008,” O’Malley said. She is happy that the Kindess Kampaign still continues at her high school. “My father, John O’Malley, has been a huge proponent of it and he’s really kept it going when all his kids have grown, and everyone who originally founded it grew up and graduated,” she said.

Flinn, Staff writer Published 5:01 pm, Wednesday, November 9, 2016 The previously untapped plat of land at the intersection of FM 1976 and Cimarron Trail is to become a bustling Converse Business Center and Industrial Flex complex, with construction expected to begin early nest year. Work will begin on the I-1-zoned property once the city finishes extending the water and sewer lines to the area, said according to Kate Silvas, executive director of the Converse Economic Development Corp. The Converse City Council in September approved a CEDC proposal to spend $69,000 on the infrastructure expenditure, a move that Silvas said was necessary in order to get the business center and industrial flex complex off the ground. Most Popular 1 Mock assassination of Trump stirs controversy at San Antonio... 2 San Antonio holidays will be full of celebrations, events,... 3 Trump may be setting a record for broken promises “That’s ($69,000) not a huge amount, but it makes a different in opening development in that area. It’s important for tenants to have those services available when they move in,” Silvas said. “Infrastructure underground is often what drives economic development. We feel like we’re making a smart investment in this, and that we’ll recover our investment and then some.” Troy Lott, owner of TJ Elite Properties, said he is excited to bring new investment and jobs to the community through development of this site. “We know Converse well and we know we have come to the right place to do business,” said Lott, who owns Lott’s Landing, a strip of retail shops along FM 78 across from the Converse Walmart. Silvas, who is closing in on her her sixth year as the EDC director, said the acreage at Cimarron Trail and FM 1976 sat dormant for as long as she has been with the city. On the edge of Converse city limits, the 3.7-acre spread is attractive to firms looking to the area for cheap operating costs and direct transportation outlets. “It’s a great opportunity to get an edge on location and transportation in and out of the area. It’s on FM 1976, with a link to Loop 1604, and direct access to Interstates 10 and 35 in either direction,” she said. The property also extends Converse’s outreach to the business and industrial world. “There’s so much need for industrial space. Industrial space in Converse is almost literally 100 percent full. It remains leased out most of the time,’ she said. “Troy (Lott) decided he’d undertake flex office space, to allow for some business and industrial to be co-located.” Phase One of the two-phase development will house five buildings providing a total of 42,950 square feet of lease space. Silvas explained the “co-located” venture and the business center-industrial flex aspect of the property. “With the business center and industrial flex, you can have an office or office space attached to a warehouse; it ‘co-locates’ the business aspect to the industrial aspect,” she said, “for those needing both office and warehouse space. It’s zoned I-1, industrial. You can have warehouse deliveries and business to the front, and ship and receive orders out the back.” Silvas said the city is in touch with some possible suitors for the site. Tenants “will be a compatible user, and we’re working with a number of businesses that would fit right in with this sort of development.” The property is going through the permitting process while the city extends utilities to the area. “Generally, we expect something to be happening before the end of the first quarter in 2017,” she added. jflinn@express-news.net Breaking News Man dead after hours-long standoff on Northwest Side A man is dead following a fight that ended in gunfire Sunday...

"Following" : "Follow"}} November 18, 2016 2:29pm   Comments Share: (Find this article and others like it at DriveWealth.com.) The following sentence will likely be the most obvious thing you’ll read all day. Saving money is HARD. Yes, we know – obvious. However, one thing that’s much less obvious is finding a steady routine that actually helps you save money. If you ask around, people will tell you that there are options everywhere – and they’re really not wrong. “Check the sale racks first” and “bring a friend with you who can help you decide what you really need,” they say. And while both suggestions are good pieces of advice, many of us are in need of some spending advice that isn’t also based on spending. So, if you’re not quite ready to “save 15% by switching your car insurance to GEICO” or you just don’t see the value in “saving money and living better” by shopping solely at Wal-Mart, you might want a money-saving plan that revolves around the most important piece of this saving equation: not the spending, but you. No two money-savers are alike. But, to find a plan that works best, we all definitely need a little inspiration and (maybe) a push to keep us going throughout. Keeping those ideas in mind, here are four money-saving ideas that will not only inspire your inner competitive side, but also give you the push you need to keep the saving going! Most importantly, these money saving competitions can show you that saving money can be really effective, if you try new things and focus on methods that work best for you: 1. The Save-Off This one is geared towards proactive and competitive savers. The game is almost exactly how it sounds – but far more fun. Know anyone else in need of a good saving spree? Challenge them. Challenge your mom, brother, best friend, husband, yoga instructor – whoever. The point is to keep someone else involved so you are continually reminded to keep saving. You’ll be surprised how much a little challenge can really motivate you. Next, buy and decorate large jars for everyone who plans on competing and advise all competitors to place their jars in a location where they’ll be reminded to save each day. Then, pick a length of time – we recommend a month, three months, or six months to start (something concrete, but long enough to see real results) – and get to saving! Each week, total the amount of money that you have in your jar and report it to other competitors. The point of this is to create a numbers game – knowing how much other people can do will only make you want to keep saving. At the end, have all participants tally their money and agree on a prize for the winner! 2. The Family Game Here’s one for the innovative saver: it’s time to start a competition within your home! Get your spouse, roommate, kids, siblings, or parents to participate in this saving competition that is fueled only by your own creativity. The goal of the game is to find the most creative or innovative ways to save money or re-use items you already own. Keep it ethical and reasonable, of course, but you’ll definitely start to realize that the people around you are capable of coming up with some pretty great ideas! Anything from biking around the neighborhood instead of driving and saving plastic bags to re-using newspaper as giftwrap or starting your own garden is fair game in this competition. Each participant should keep a list of their most innovative ideas and vote to give a small prize each week to the person who can come up with the best idea! 3. The Expense Tracker Like we said, all savers are different. So, this game works more by seeing who can spend less than seeing who can save more. The Expense Tracker will surely help you notice the flaws in your spending habits. Pick your competitors and have everyone write down the amount of money they spend on inessential items for one week. The person who spends the least gets a prize – think something small, like a homemade dinner or (if you want to make the stakes high) a small percentage of the money you’ve saved. Then, start again for the next week. By going on a weekly basis, you and your friends will have something exciting to look forward to at the end of each week, while also becoming totally aware of your spending. This game will definitely make you re-think how much you really need. 4. The $20 A Day Challenge Instead of taking free will to spend how much you want and tally it, this game works better for people who need concrete limits. Pick a challenging amount of money (we chose $20, you might be okay with less or decide you need a little more) that you think you might realistically be able to get by with each day. Make sure you can agree on that number with your friends or family members who also want to participate, so that the competition is fair. Then, set aside enough for one week. For example, if you pick $20 a day, you would set aside $140 for a week ($20 x 7 days). Whoever has the most of their “weekly fund” left at the end of the week is the winner, and gets a prize! All four of these competitions target different types of people. What motivates you? If you know, pick one of these and try it. If you don’t, try more than one method to figure out your best saving habits. With a little competitive push from your friends and some real results, these (albeit cheesy) money-saving competitions can prove to be more fun and more effective than you ever thought!

Chris Bodenner Nov 19, 2016 China’s Great Leap Backward James Fallows Nov 15, 2016 Kaveh Waddell Nov 18, 2016 Technology Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size In an enormous grocery store in northern France, the lights above the aisles aren’t all they seem to be. They look ordinary—more than a mile and a half of fixtures exuding bright light, folded into a grid overhead—but they’re actually flickering faster than the human eye can see. The unique patterns each individual section of lighting emits are a 21st-century twist on Morse code, meant not for people, but for the cameras on their phones. If shoppers grant the store’s app access to their smartphone’s front-facing lens, the phone can watch for the lights and use the pulses to pinpoint its location. Doing so allows the app to plot the best routes for shopping lists, tracking people as they travel through the store. (The guidance might come in especially handy for first-time visitors to the 84,000-square foot Carrefour “hypermarket,” the French equivalent of a Walmart.) Location information is one of the most valuable types of data a retailer can gather from its customers, says Joseph Turow, a professor of communications at the University of Pennsylvania. (I interviewed Turow about the future of retail surveillance last month.) If a retailer knows where you spent most of your time inside of a store, it can follow up with discounts for a product you looked at but didn’t buy—either after you’ve left the store, to encourage a return trip, or even right as you’re lingering in the aisle, to nudge you to buy it now. In the U.S., Target and Walmart are rumored to use lighting technology to locate smartphone-toting shoppers, but aren’t forthcoming about their plans. The system being tested in the French supermarket offers a glimpse of what light bulbs might soon be able to do. There, the light fixtures’ imperceptible blinking is transmitting a very basic stream of data, but LED light bulbs are capable of sending a lot more than just a simple pattern. They can deliver an entire internet connection. • • • Five years ago, Harald Haas, a professor of electronics engineering at the University of Edinburgh, was pacing on a small stage. He was giving a TED talk as high-definition video of blooming flowers looped behind him. He approached a desk lamp he’d placed on a gray tabletop, and stuck his hand underneath the light. The video stopped. When he removed his hand, it started up again. The light, he explained, was transmitting video data to a receiver beneath the lamp, at a speed comparable to Wi-Fi. In a lab setting, light bulbs can beam data at a speed of more than 10 gigabits per second—that’s really, really fast. After his 2011 talk, Haas started a company called pureLiFi, which announced this year that it will install light-based internet in the Paris headquarters of the French real-estate development company Sogeprom. “We’re basically at the stage that Wi-Fi was 15 years ago,” Haas told me. For now, connecting to a Li-Fi network requires a USB dongle—a throwback to the age of Wi-Fi cards that stick out of the side of your laptop. Data carried over visible light doesn’t need a direct sightline between a light bulb and a device in order to work. Just like ambient light in a room still illuminates the floor beneath a table, data-laden light beams can reflect off of walls and objects on their way to a device. Haas envisions that the laptops of the future will have multiple light sensors—maybe one at every corner of the screen—so that they can continue receiving uninterrupted even if one or more of the receivers is covered. (References to LiFi have been found buried in the code of recent versions of iOS, but the technology doesn’t exist in any smartphone or computer yet.) Unlike a Wi-Fi signal, visible light can’t, of course, travel through walls or floors—but that can actually be a useful feature, Haas says. In sensitive environments like a government building, administrators can confine a network only to the rooms where people need to access it, avoiding the threat of a hacker intruding into a wireless network that’s bled across the hall or out onto the street. Visible light can also be used to transmit data where Wi-Fi networks can interfere with delicate electronics, like in hospitals. One of the draws of light-delivered internet is that the lighting has already been installed in just about every office and residential building. The hard part is connecting the light bulbs to the net: If each one has to be wired individually, the ease of using light bulbs is canceled out; if each fixture still has to use Wi-Fi to communicate with a central router, then LiFi will never be faster than Wi-Fi itself. Haas suggests that power-line communication can help connect light fixtures by sending data over electric lines in a home or an office. But there might be another way to connect light bulbs to the internet without using cables or Wi-Fi. A group of researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and Disney Research, led by Stefan Schmid, proposed a system called EnLighting that functions as a mesh network: It allows each light bulb to “see” signals blinked out by nearby bulbs and repeat them. That way, only one light bulb needs to be connected to the internet—the others can pick up the signal it’s putting out and rebroadcast it. • • • Even if LED lights become a standard way to send data, they come with one enormous drawback: Turning off the lights would cut off the internet. To solve that problem, Zhao Tian, a Ph.D. candidate at Dartmouth, designed a system that can transmit data with such dim and spaced-out pulses that active light bulbs appear to be off. If there’s any ambient light at all—sun filtered through a window, or a computer or TV screen—Tian’s “DarkLight” LED looks totally extinguished; only in complete darkness does it emit a faint glow, which Tian describes as “even lower than the moon at night.” Lowering the power and speed at which the LED flickers means transmitting information much more slowly. But the system can calibrate itself to the ambient light around it, so it only slows down and dims itself when it’s in darkness. With Wi-Fi and cellular data speeds getting faster by the year, a new way to send data wirelessly may not seem absolutely necessary. But research firms forecast that the market for Li-Fi could be worth more than $100 billion by 2022, perhaps betting that it could leapfrog Wi-Fi’s speed limitations. Given that Apple already appears to be exploring the technology for its phones, we may someday soon be holding our devices up to the light instead of waving them toward the router to get a better signal.

This year, the lesson feels different. My classroom becomes a totalitarian state every school year toward the end of October. In preparation for teaching 1984 to seniors, I announce the launch of a new program aimed at combating senioritis, a real disease with symptoms that include frequent unexplained absences, indifferent reading, and shoddy work. I tell each class that another class is largely to blame for the problem and require, for a substantial participation grade, that students file daily reports on another student’s work habits and conduct; most are assigned to another student in the same class. We blanket the campus in posters featuring my face and simple slogans that warn against the dangers of senioritis and declare my program the only solution to the school’s woes. Last year, my program was OSIP (Organization for Senior Improvement Project); this year, it’s SAFE (Scholar Alliance For Excellence). We chant a creed at the start of each class, celebrate the revelatory reports of “heroes” with cheers, and boo those who fail to participate enthusiastically. I create a program Instagram that students eagerly follow. I occasionally bestow snacks as rewards.

They won’t change anything, though. This article was updated on November 16 at 11:02 a.m. ET This chart has been making the rounds on Twitter these past few days: Turns out it's not a Trump insurgency, but a Clinton collapse. A graph that cuts straight through today's punditry ... pic.twitter.com/x41cyyy2XI — Jonathan Webber (@jonathanwebber) November 9, 2016 Donald Trump didn’t actually flip many Democrats, the thinking goes. Instead, Hillary Clinton failed to turn out liberal voters who had previously voted for Barack Obama. It’s a tempting narrative for smarting progressives, as it maintains status quo thinking—Clinton’s unlikable!—and removes any culpability on the part of the Democrats for missing a massive shift in the electorate. In other words, it’s Clinton’s fault, not theirs, that Trump won the presidency. Continue Reading Patrons' Permanent Fund / National Gallery of Art Rewriting the Biblical 'Curse' on Womankind Chenxin Jiang A change to a popular translation of the Bible could affect readers’ views on marriage and gender roles. In the biblical book of Genesis, God expels the first two human beings from the Garden of Eden after Eve entices Adam to eat the forbidden fruit. God “curses” Eve for her misdeed, using ominous words that seem to doom her to live subordinately to Adam. In the phrasing of the historic King James Version familiar to many Protestant readers, God says, “Thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.” This phrase was recently altered in the English Standard Version translation of the Bible—which is produced by a committee of prominent theologians and typically used by evangelicals—so that the intent of the “curse” seems different. Whereas the first half of that sentence formerly read “Your desire shall be for your husband,” it now reads, “Your desire shall be contrary to your husband.” It appears to suggest that women naturally oppose their husbands’ desires, and thus are responsible for marital conflict. While many major Bible translations are regularly updated, this alteration isn’t as inconsequential as it may seem: Translations like this have the potential to invisibly shape evangelicals’ thinking about women’s role in marriage. Continue Reading Evan Agostini / AP Hamilton’s Message to Pence: Was It Harassment? Chris Bodenner None Ben, the reader who sparked our long and evolving discussion thread on the best ways for Trump voters and other Americans to engage, emails about a new flashpoint: the cast of Hamilton delivering a short speech to VP-elect Mike Pence, who attended a performance of the musical on Broadway last night. Here’s how CNN covered it: Here’s Ben: I’m seeing an awful lot of social media commentary looking at Trump’s tweets regarding the cast’s message to Pence, and nearly all of it follows a certain pattern of “Boo Hoo, Trump doesn’t like it when actors exercise their first amendment rights? Cry me a river.” On one hand, they are completely right: The note-reading by cast member Brandon Dixon was protected speech, and political speech. It’s very, very important that people are able to do what the Hamilton cast did, and I think very few people will disagree with that. On the other hand, it’s pretty hard to be the least bit objective and not acknowledge that what happened was harassment, or at least something pretty close. The story is being presented near universally as “Trump is whining because Pence received a note!,” but let’s break down the evening in dry terms and see if that holds up: Continue Reading Oliver Munday China’s Great Leap Backward James Fallows The country has become repressive in a way that it has not been since the Cultural Revolution. What does its darkening political climate—and growing belligerence—mean for the United States? What if China is going bad? Since early last year I have been asking people inside and outside China versions of this question. By “bad” I don’t mean morally. Moral and ethical factors obviously matter in foreign policy, but I’m talking about something different. Nor is the question mainly about economics, although for China the short-term stability and long-term improvement of jobs, wages, and living standards are fundamental to the government’s survival. Under China’s single-party Communist arrangement, sustained economic failure would naturally raise questions about the system as a whole, as it did in the Soviet Union. True, modern China’s economic performance even during its slowdowns is like the Soviet Union’s during its booms. But the absence of a political outlet for dissatisfaction is similar. Continue Reading Bettman / Getty Progress Isn't Natural Joel Mokyr Humans invented it—and not that long ago. How and why did the modern world and its unprecedented prosperity begin? Many bookshelves are full of learned tomes by historians, economists, political philosophers and other erudite scholars with endless explanations. One way of looking at the question is by examining something basic, and arguably essential: the emergence of a belief in the usefulness of progress. Such a belief may seem self-evident today, but most people in the more-remote past believed that history moved in some kind of cycle or followed a path that was determined by higher powers. The idea that humans should and could work consciously to make the world a better place for themselves and for generations to come is by and large one that emerged in the two centuries between Christopher Columbus and Isaac Newton. Of course, just believing that progress could be brought about is not enough—one must bring it about. The modern world began when people resolved to do so.               Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism, disagreeableness, grandiosity—a psychologist investigates how Trump’s extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006, Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate, near Aberdeen, Scotland, aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estate’s owner, Tom Griffin, sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock & Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator, reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But, as Michael D’Antonio writes in his recent biography of Trump, Never Enough, Griffin’s most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. “It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump,” Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Stevo Vasiljevic / Reuters Can America and Russia Both Be Great Again? Uri Friedman Why the Trump-Putin bromance might not last All signs seem to point to a budding bromance between the American president-elect and the Russian president. Donald Trump has praised Vladimir Putin as a strong leader, proposed reconciling with Russia so they can fight terrorism together, raised doubts about America’s commitment to NATO and the independence of Ukraine, and argued that America shouldn’t lecture other countries about democracy and human rights—all wonderful news for the Kremlin. Putin has been more restrained, describing Trump as “bright.” But his deeds appear more forceful than his words: U.S. intelligence agencies have accused Putin’s government of directing hackers to meddle in the 2016 election—perhaps in Trump’s favor, or at least at the expense of Hillary Clinton. Earlier this week, in a phone call, the two men discussed how to “normalize relations.” The Drudge Report captured the mood with a sketch of the leaders, looking heroic and macho in identical black blazers and white button-downs, over the headline, “TRUMP AND PUTIN: WE WILL DESTROY ISIS!” Continue Reading Win McNamee / Getty The Lessons of Henry Kissinger Jeffrey Goldberg The legendary and controversial statesman criticizes the Obama Doctrine, talks about the main challenges for the next president, and explains how to avoid war with China. Author’s note (November 10, 2016): Over the past several months, I’ve interviewed Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, numerous times on the subject of America’s role in the world. Our conversations took place before this week’s election, but were informed by the foreign-policy differences between the candidates. The December 2016 issue of The Atlantic includes my article on these conversations, which you will  find published below. In addition, a full rendering of our several interviews, on subjects including the future of Russia, the rise of China, and the chaos of the Middle East, can be found here. On Wednesday, the day the country, and the world, were just beginning to absorb the shock of Donald Trump’s victory, I spoke with Kissinger by telephone to get his postelection thoughts. He told me that he was expecting other nations, particularly the great powers, to enter a period of intense study, in order to understand how they should respond to a Trump presidency. He also said he expected the Islamic State, or other similarly minded jihadist organizations, to test Trump early by launching attacks, in order to provoke a reaction (or, he suggested, an overreaction). Continue Reading The Voorhes How Casinos Enable Gambling Addicts John Rosengren Modern slot machines develop an unbreakable hold on many players—some of whom wind up losing their jobs, their families, and even, as in the case of Scott Stevens, their lives. On the morning of Monday, August 13, 2012, Scott Stevens loaded a brown hunting bag into his Jeep Grand Cherokee, then went to the master bedroom, where he hugged Stacy, his wife of 23 years. “I love you,” he told her. Stacy thought that her husband was off to a job interview followed by an appointment with his therapist. Instead, he drove the 22 miles from their home in Steubenville, Ohio, to the Mountaineer Casino, just outside New Cumberland, West Virginia. He used the casino ATM to check his bank-account balance: $13,400. He walked across the casino floor to his favorite slot machine in the high-limit area: Triple Stars, a three-reel game that cost $10 a spin. Maybe this time it would pay out enough to save him.

AChallenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement and executive coaching consulting firm, expects retail employers to add about 740,000 seasonal workers in the last three months of 2016 – about the same number of seasonal jobs as last year. That figure is just for retailers; other types of employers, such as hospitality and shipping businesses, also tend to hire extra workers during the holidays. SEE ALSO: 17 Ways to Earn Extra Cash for the Holidays Several companies have increased their seasonal hiring significantly over the past few years, including Amazon, which plans to hire 120,000 seasonal workers (a 140% increase from 2012); UPS, which plans to hire 95,000 seasonal workers (a 73% increase); and FedEx, which expects to hire 50,000 (a 150% increase), according to Challenger. Other retailers plan to continue with significant seasonal hiring, including 83,000 seasonal jobs at Macy’s, 77,000 at Walmart, 70,000 at Target, 69,000 at Kohl’s and 40,000 at J.C. Penney. Getting a seasonal job can be a great way to earn some extra money for the holidays or provide extra cash to help you boost your savings or get out of debt. You may also qualify for an employee discount or get your foot in the door for a new career. Some key moves can help you improve your odds of landing a seasonal job: Advertisement Act now. Many employers started hiring in October and early November, but it’s not too late to apply for a seasonal job now. Some companies continue hiring in late November and early December, says Challenger CEO John A. Challenger. SEE ALSO: 13 Ways to Waste Money During the Holidays Expand your search beyond retailers. Everyone thinks of retailers during the holidays, but many other types of businesses also need extra workers to help with the holiday rush, including hotels, restaurants, catering businesses, warehouse facilities, and transportation and shipping companies. Some businesses may need extra workers to help close out their books at the end of the year. And retailers usually have a lot more opportunities than just on the sales floor. Toys ”R” Us, for example, is hiring seasonal workers for sales, stock crew and cashiers at its stores, and it is also hiring warehouse workers, clerical specialists and others for its distribution centers. Search online and in person. You can do a lot of job hunting online, such as at Macy’s, Target, UPS, FedEx and Amazon. Toys ‘R’ Us has a link specifically for part-time holiday jobs. You can also search for seasonal jobs at CareerBuilder, Monster.com and Craigslist, or through temporary staffing agencies. Challenger also recommends visiting some businesses in person and asking about seasonal work, especially at smaller companies that may need some extra help but may not advertise seasonal jobs. It can help to visit stores where you shop regularly and already have a connection and know a lot about the business. Be flexible. You’ll have the best chance of getting the job if you can work hours that can be tougher to fill – such as during weekends and evenings, which are busy times for retailers and hospitality, and overnight shifts for warehouses and transportation companies. TAKE OUR QUIZ: Who Should You Tip for the Holidays? Try again. Challenger says that with high turnover rates in retail, it doesn’t hurt to check back even if you didn’t get a job offer when you first applied. Got a question? Ask Kim at askkim@kiplinger.com.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Another Mysterious Burst Of Radio Waves Detected Posted: Nov 18 2016, 9:44am CST | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Latest Science News   Getty Images Enigmatic Radio Signal is an Aid to Astronomers   An enigmatic radio signal is an aid to astronomers in solving the puzzle that is the universe. Astronomers have detected a radio burst which has its origin in deep space. This one is the strongest one to reach earth so far. It is in fact the 18th fast radio burst (FRB). Don't Miss: Hatchimals Deals on Amazon.com Scientists however do not know exactly what these bursts of energy happen to be in the first place. The source has been given a focal point by the astronomers though. Scientists have been able to figure out the depth and movement of the intergalactic particles that lie between the earth and this source of FRBs.  The materials from which galaxies are formed and what the universe is made of can be better known via this method. Recording FRBs is a very clean cut way of exploring space. The flashes are only for a few milliseconds. They seem to arrive from a source away from the Milky Way Galaxy. A dozen of these bursts have been detected so far. Yet astronomers are sure that thousands of these bursts take place in the sky every day. The fact remains that there is no consensus about what causes these bursts in the first place.  Some say that collisions between neutron stars cause them to occur. It is entirely possible that multiple causes lie behind these bursts. What we do know is that these radio waves occur at gigahertz frequencies. These are on the same wavelength as cell phones. Also telescopes exist that can pick up these signals in a jiffy. One such telescope is the CSIRO Parkes observatory in Australia. The FRB found via this telescope was high energy and the research team could detect its source in the sky. It was a billion light years away, according to The Verge.  Many possible galaxies could have been the source points for this signal. The topmost choice is VHS7. It is still a moot point though. A large part of the universe is in the form of plasma matter. This was known through this FRB which illuminated the matter that lay in between stellar and intergalactic stuff. This is the first time that such indirect measurements were taken of the universe. The evolution of the universe and its large-scale structure can be gauged through this methodology.

(Reuters/Aaron P. Bernstein/File Photo) Share Written by Nancy Pfund Obsession 2016 November 18, 2016 Like many others, proponents of clean energy were thrown into a state of shock after the US election results. During the campaign, now President-elect Trump dismissed climate change as a Chinese hoax and threatened an abrupt shift in US energy policy. Despite this shaken political climate, there are many reasons to remain optimistic about the prospects for clean energy in the United States. Specifically, renewable energy is broadly popular, makes sense financially, and is largely state-regulated. Outside of Washington, there is overwhelming support for renewable energy. Gallup found that 79% of Americans would like to see more emphasis on domestic solar energy production and they are increasingly voting with their roofs: more than one million US homes now have solar panels installed. Red states like South Dakota and Idaho are on the forefront of renewable energy adoption alongside blue states like California and Massachusetts. Clean energy is not a partisan issue—it’s a technology that can provide solid middle class jobs and energy savings for all. Renewables energy’s popularity is similarly broad among corporations. Over 80 major companies have committed to the goal of 100% renewable energy including Ikea, Apple, Google, Bank of America, Coca Cola, Nike, P&G, Walmart, and many more. Whole Foods achieved the feat back in 2006. Increasingly corporations are breaking from traditional models and producing and buying renewable energy directly to meet their goals. For example, earlier this year three of Nevada’s largest casinos—MGM Resorts, Wynn, and the Las Vegas Sands—announced plans to leave the state’s utility to procure more renewable energy on the open market. A key driver to country-wide adoption of renewable energy by both consumers and corporations is economics. Regardless of one’s views of the environment, renewable energy, particularly when combined with storage, is increasingly the right financial decision. The cost of producing solar energy, for instance, has fallen rapidly and is now 70% less expensive than it was a decade ago. Further, renewable energy provides more price stability than conventional fossil fuels, which may be further exacerbated if we enter an era of trade wars. Finally, state and local governments play a much larger role in the management of the energy industry than the federal government. State utility commissions lead utility regulation and are guided by state legislatures and governors in setting goals, incentives, and policy guidelines. State-level ballot initiatives have further demonstrated broad consumer support for renewable policies. This week Florida voters defeated a utility-supported measure to restrict solar in the state and Nevada voted overwhelmingly to end NV Energy’s legal monopoly and create a path for more clean, cost-effective energy in the state. Renewable energy’s popularity, low cost, and state-led regulation provide a good deal of insulation from the tumultuous national politics, but there’s also reason to believe that the clean energy industry is well-aligned with the objectives of a Trump administration. If president-elect Trump is truly committed to growing American jobs and building American industry, the clean energy industry is a crucial component of that economic engine. The solar industry alone employs 140,000 more workers than the coal mining industry and is growing rapidly. Further, Trump has vocally supported increasing investment in US infrastructure. The infrastructure of the 21st century is not just highways and bridges. It’s wind and solar plants, charging networks for electric vehicles and energy storage. Modernizing and expanding ports to handle offshore wind installations will support dockworkers, shipbuilders and a more diverse coastal economy. Upgrading our electric grid will make transporting clean energy easier, as well as hardening it against terrorist attack. Support for the clean energy industry translates directly into the growth for the US economy, middle class manufacturing jobs, and enhanced national security. More broadly, the United States must maintain its leadership role in the growing global industry of clean energy. Both the public and private sectors have the opportunity and responsibility to bring the technology and know-how of our industry to the rest of the world, particularly to the developing world where it would be most beneficial and help expand the middle class as the population grows. Americans should continue to support an industry that can grow jobs here and in regions around the world to prevent the social and environmental problems of the future as we nurture a strong and substantial 21st century workforce.

Keith Irving, 46, of the 500 block of West Broadway St., is accused of loading up a cart with household items, including a $196 vacuum, which he tried to return, Freeport Police Deputy Chief Matt Summers said. When the cashier did not accept the return without the receipt, Irving allegedly walked out of the store with the vacuum. A Wal-Mart employee called the police, who were able to stop Irving's vehicle. Irving has a prior retail theft conviction dating back to 2004.
