KTRK Monday, March 27, 2017 06:35PM BAYTOWN, Texas (KTRK) -- Police are looking for several suspects in a series of baby formula thefts from a Baytown Walmart. Police say the thefts have occurred over the past several months at the Walmart in the 4900 block of Garth Rd. "The suspects in these cases act in an orchestrated manner with the males acting as lookouts, while the women enter the store with a baby stroller or baby carrier and diaper bags," said Lt. Steve Dorris, with the Baytown Police Dept. Police say the women load the diaper bags with the baby formula and leave the store without paying.

Walmart U.S. E-commerce CEO Marc Lore said the U.S. holds much opportunity for growth and his mandate is to win U.S. online market share. He said the recent acquisitions of online speciality retailers were part of that strategy. When asked about Wal-Mart’s global e-commerce business plans, he said that’s not his priority. Internationally, the e-commerce businesses report to their in-country president and Lore said the opportunity in the U.S. is too big to ignore. Last year total e-commerce sales in the U.S. were $394.9 billion, up 15.1% from the prior year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Slice Intelligence said in February that 43% of all online retail sales in the U.S. last year went through Amazon. The online retailer also accounted for 53% of the market’s overall growth last year. In 2015, Amazon had 33% of all online sales. However, a majority of those sales are through third-party marketplaces. Amazon’s direct share is about 15%, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. According to recent data from eMarketer, Wal-Mart is the second largest U.S. online retailer, with roughly $15 billion in sales in the last year, but is a distant second with about 3.8% of the online market share. The global e-commerce market is expected to grow to $2.3 trillion this year. Asia Pacific is the largest market. The bulk of retail e-commerce will come from China, where sales were about $899 billion last year, representing almost half (47.0%) of all such sales worldwide, according to data provider eMarketer. North America is considered the second largest market with retail e-commerce sales of $423.34 billion last year, most of which was in the U.S. LIMITED GLOBAL MOVES BY WAL-MART Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon recently told the Harvard Business Review (HBR) that the U.S. still represents a growth opportunity, which is why the retailer does not talk as much as it global operations. He did say the retailer looks for growth internationally over time. “China is in a league of it’s own. India is important to figure out. Sub-Saharan Africa is exciting to us,” McMillon said in the HBR interview. Last month Wal-Mart increased its ownership stake in China-based JD.com to 12.1%, up from 10.8%. The market value of Wal-Mart’s JD.Com stake is roughly $4.87 billion. Wal-Mart has increased its ownership twice since the partnering with JD.com in June 2016. This is an important play for Walmart China, where Alibaba has had huge head start and local supply chain advantage. Walmart’s grocery component in China with JD Daojia allows consumers to order online fresh foods which are fulfilled from 20 physical stores and delivered within two hours in select cities. “Walmart is getting this right. It’s good to see them leveraging their assets (stores/ merchandise) with JD’s expertise in delivery,” noted Annibal Sodero, assistant professor of supply chain at the University of Arkansas. Wal-Mart’s U.S. division is important for the company’s e-commerce effort given its more than 4,000 retail stores located with 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population. AMAZON’S GLOBAL MOVES But markets in India continue to flourish without Wal-Mart, while Amazon has is growing Indian market share. Amazon has  poured more than $5 billion into India over the past three years ramping up it own namesake in that country. Last Fall Wal-Mart was rumored to be in talks with Indian e-tailer FlipKart, but no deal has been made. Amazon recently confirmed it agreed to buy 100% of Dubai-based online retailer Souq.com, for an undisclosed amount. Souq.com sells consumer electronics, household items, apparel and other goods and is the most recognized e-tailer in the Middle East. Again this is an area not served by Walmart International. Sodero said it’s important for Wal-Mart to remember that Amazon is on a mission to win global market share. He said the only way Wal-Mart can compete globally with the likes of Alibaba and Amazon is to partner up with retailers native to certain countries like India, where the laws and cultures can be challenging. But it appears that Wal-Mart is focused on U.S. online acquisitions. Sodero said the recent acquisitions could end up looking like Frankenstein without a successful integration plan.

Nadya Faulx / KMUW/File photo A furniture store, not a grocery store, will soon occupy the former Walmart Neighborhood Market in northeast Wichita. Listen Listening... / 0:54 Walmart closed several Neighborhood Markets in Wichita last year, including one at 13th and Oliver. American Freight, an Ohio-based furniture store known for low-cost items, will move into the space. “We just really want to build up the business in that area and so we welcome American Freight to come in," says City Council member Lavonta Williams. "But we also have that desire and that need for groceries.” The area is considered a food desert: a low-income neighborhood that is at least a mile away from a full-service grocery store. Williams, whose district includes the neighborhood around 13th and Oliver, says a store with fresh fruit and vegetables is still needed. The former Walmart building sold at a lower price to a company that wanted a large space that required few renovations. American Freight is expected to open in a few weeks. -- Carla Eckels is assistant news director and the host of Soulsations. Follow her on Twitter @Eckels.

The monthly event series is aimed to assist suppliers doing business with Walmart to increase their business knowledge of top practices and business expectations.  This month’s event, called The Future of Omnichannel, will consist of a panel of omnichannel experts who will share industry insights in an open questions and answers format. The two-hour seminar will begin at 7 a.m.  „As Walmart continues to invest in satisfying the Omnichannel shopper, Walmart suppliers will experience rapid changes in merchandising, marketing and technology,” said Eric Howerton, CEO of WhyteSpyder and co-moderator of the event. „Suppliers can win big with Walmart omnichannel initiatives, but they need timely information of how – that’s what this event is designed to do.” The seminar will be hosted by the following panelists within the Walmart supplier, marketing and technology roles:  The Future of Omnichannel will be focused on the many ways today’s shoppers conduct online research to make confident purchasing decisions both online and in-store. „My hope is that suppliers will walk away…with a common grounding on the new ‚rules of engagement’ in this era of metacommerce at Walmart/Sam’s Club and the retail industry as a whole. Change has always been a constant in the GCP/Retail relationship, only now at an accelerated pace thanks to pressure from Amazon and disruptive startups,” said panelist, Bill Akins.  „This month’s program will provide a great opportunity for Walmart suppliers and their marketing agencies to hear firsthand from experts in the industry on this important topic, gaining a better understanding of best practices and expectations for Omnichannel,” said Steve Schotta, Executive Director of Doing Business in Bentonville.

Dozens of people stormed into an Arkansas Wal-Mart late Friday, taking and throwing items from shelves as they made their way through the store, police said. The Jonesboro Police Department responded about 11:20 p.m. to the Wal-Mart at 1815 E. Highland Drive in Jonesboro in reference to disorderly conduct, according to a report. Inside the store, officers spoke with the store manager, who said about 30 people — males and females — had rushed inside the retailer. Surveillance video showed the group ransacking shelves and throwing items on the floor, all of which was being filmed on cellphones, the report stated. The manager said that after confronting the group, its members scattered down another aisle and left the store. Several vehicles were seen leaving the Wal-Mart, police noted. Nearby, officers found three teenage boys — two 15-year-olds and a 17-year-old — who were later identified by the manager as being involved. All were cited on disorderly conduct and criminal mischief charges and released, according to police. A Wal-Mart shopper told authorities that she and her child ran and hid out of fear as the group went inside. It was not immediately clear whether items were stolen from the store.

I hope there's enough video evidence to support arrests of those involved. ( permalink | suggest removal ) Kharma says... March 27, 2017 at 3:57 p.m. Sounds like some lowlife nonsense to me.

The monthly event series is aimed to assist suppliers doing business with Walmart to increase their business knowledge of top practices and business expectations.  This month's event, called The Future of Omnichannel, will consist of a panel of omnichannel experts who will share industry insights in an open questions and answers format. The two-hour seminar will begin at 7 a.m.  "As Walmart continues to invest in satisfying the Omnichannel shopper, Walmart suppliers will experience rapid changes in merchandising, marketing and technology," said Eric Howerton, CEO of WhyteSpyder and co-moderator of the event. "Suppliers can win big with Walmart omnichannel initiatives, but they need timely information of how – that's what this event is designed to do." The seminar will be hosted by the following panelists within the Walmart supplier, marketing and technology roles:  J.P. De Villiers, Director of Content, Walmart Eric Howerton, Chief Executive Officer of WhyteSpyder, Inc. Bill Akins, Chief Client Officer of Rockfish Henry Ho, Chief Strategy Officer & Co-Founder, Field Agent Damian Lux, Senior Director Sales, Danone Walmart Team Rachel Hocevar, Vice President of Client Success at Bazaarvoice The Future of Omnichannel will be focused on the many ways today's shoppers conduct online research to make confident purchasing decisions both online and in-store. "My hope is that suppliers will walk away…with a common grounding on the new 'rules of engagement' in this era of metacommerce at Walmart/Sam's Club and the retail industry as a whole. Change has always been a constant in the GCP/Retail relationship, only now at an accelerated pace thanks to pressure from Amazon and disruptive startups," said panelist, Bill Akins.  "This month's program will provide a great opportunity for Walmart suppliers and their marketing agencies to hear firsthand from experts in the industry on this important topic, gaining a better understanding of best practices and expectations for Omnichannel," said Steve Schotta, Executive Director of Doing Business in Bentonville.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com More Big Brands Pull Ads from YouTube in Widening Boycott By Michael Liedtke PUBLISHED: MARCH 27 2017 An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening, a sign that big-spending companies doubt Google's ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google's automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don't appear alongside unsavory videos. It's not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company's confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube -- an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won't return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. "The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values," Wal-Mart said in a Friday statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than two million other third-party websites. If Google can't lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google's corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube's ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totaled $73.5 billion last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google's partners. YouTube accounted for $5.6 billion, or nearly 8 percent, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer Inc. At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet's net revenue by about 2 percent this year. Moody's Investor Service predicted the backlash won't last long because Google is "laser-focused" on cleaning things up on YouTube. Alphabet's stock price has fallen nearly 4 percent since the boycott began last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in YouTube videos delving into contentious themes. The shares fell $4.51 to close at $835.14 Friday. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved. Image credit: iStock.

More Big Brands Pull YouTube Ads Next Article > Uber Halts Self-Driving Cars After Arizona Crash PUBLISHED: MARCH 27 2017 Uber suspended its pilot program testing self-driving cars after one of the vehicles was involved in an accident in Arizona, the company said Saturday. The accident happened when a self-driving Volvo XC90 sport-utility vehicle was struck by another vehicle that failed to yield when making a left turn. The SUV overturned and struck a third vehicle. No serious injuries were reported, police said. The Uber vehicle was not at fault for the accident, officers said. The ride-sharing company has been testing self-driving cars in Tempe, Ariz., Pittsburgh and California for months as it undertakes one of the most ambitious autonomous vehicle projects in the country. Uber was forced to halt its California pilot project when the city of San Francisco and the state revoked vehicle registrations after a permitting dispute. The company has since applied for the state autonomous vehicle permit and has put two such cars back on the road there. While technically self-driving, all of Uber's pilot vehicles have a driver behind the wheel who can take over control of the vehicle at any time. In Saturday's crash, the driver was the only individual inside and the SUV was operating in autonomous mode. The company released a statement on the incident, saying they are "looking into" what happened. They did not offer a timetable for when the self-driving vehicles would return to the road. © 2017 UPI Top Stories under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

He says he'll cut taxes, loosen regulations and increase spending on infrastructure -- all things that tend to rev up investment. At the same time, the markets and economy were doing just fine before Election Day. Trump, of course, is not shy about taking credit. And it's no surprise that companies are touting their job announcements. But how much credit he merits for many of the individual corporate moves is more complicated. In many cases, the jobs he has promoted are part of previously announced plans. Here are the facts. Ford (Part Two) On March 28, Ford announced a $1.2 billion investment in three Michigan facilities. What Trump said: The president sent a tweet touting a "big announcement" from Ford. "Car companies coming back to U.S.," he said. The facts: Ford said it plans to invest $850 million in its Wayne, Michigan, assembly plant. The company will also pump $150 million into its engine plant in Romeo, Michigan, and $200 million into a Michigan data center. Most of this investment was already agreed upon as part of a 2015 labor deal with the United Auto Workers union. At that time, Ford pledged to invest $700 million in Wayne and $150 million in Romeo, creating or retaining 130 jobs. So most of the news wasn't new. But the investment did ensure that the 3,700 workers in Wayne won't have their jobs shipped to Mexico anytime soon. Charter Communications On March 24, Charter Communications announced plans to invest $25 billion in the United States and to hire 20,000 American workers in the next four years. What Trump said: "Today, I am thrilled to announce that Charter Communications has just committed to investing $25 billion, with a 'B,'" Trump said in a joint announcement with the Charter chief executive in the Oval Office. He later tweeted his thanks. The facts: Charter, a telecommunications company, said it would invest $25 billion in broadband infrastructure and technology in the next four years. The company also committed to hiring 20,000 American workers during that period, and said it would bring back all overseas call centers and build a new call center in Texas. The 20,000 jobs, at least, have been in the works for more than a year. CEO Tom Rutledge said in 2015 that Charter would need to bring on 20,000 additional workers if the company's merger with Time Warner Cable and acquisition of Bright House Networks went through. A Charter spokesman reiterated the claim in April 2016. (Time Warner Cable is not affiliated with Time Warner, the owner of CNN.) The FCC approved the deal last May, and Rutledge said in January that the company had plans to hire 20,000 new employees within three years. Charter said Friday's announcement marked a firm commitment to hire, despite its earlier announcements. "We have spoken about our plans to hire 20k before but it wasn't a commitment," Charter spokesman Justin Venech told CNNMoney in an email. "Today we committed to a time frame of four years for those hires." The $25 billion investment, Venech said, had not been previously announced. General Motors (Part Two) On March 15, GM announced that it's adding or bringing back 900 U.S. jobs in Michigan over the next 12 months. What Trump said: "Just today -- breaking news -- General Motors announced that they're adding or keeping 900 jobs right here in Michigan," Trump said at a Detroit-area campaign speech after meeting with automakers. He added that the number of jobs in the region "would've been heading down big league if I didn't get elected." The facts: Just under 700 GM workers laid off earlier this month will get their jobs back. GM plans to reinstate 500 jobs at its Lansing plant in 2018, and it's creating 180 plant jobs in nearby Flint for accommodate some who were fired. The company will also hire 220 new workers at its plant in Romulus. GM did not directly attribute the announcement to Trump or his policies. The decision was predicated upon a "strong economy with a strong manufacturing sector," GM spokesman Tom Wickham said, as well as "anticipated strong demand" for crossover vehicles. However, the announcement came hours before Trump flew to Michigan to talk about fuel economy rules with top automakers, including GM CEO Mary Barra. "Today's event gave us a positive venue to share good news," Wickham said. The carmaker already announced in January that it would invest $1 billion in U.S. factories and create or retain 7,000 domestic jobs. ExxonMobil On March 6, CEO Darren Woods said the company is investing $20 billion in Gulf Coast manufacturing operations over 10 years, creating 45,000 jobs. What Trump said: Trump tweeted about the announcement five times, and the White House put out a laudatory press release. "This is a true American success story," the president said in a statement. Trump said in a video that Exxon's investment was happening "to a large extent because of our policies and the policies of this new administration." The facts: The jobs are part of an Exxon project called Growing the Gulf, which was launched in 2013 and aims to tap into the nation's shale boom. The company plans 11 natural gas projects along the Texas and Louisiana coasts. An ExxonMobil spokesman said he didn't know how many of the 45,000 jobs were created between 2013 and 2016. The investment is in line with Exxon's broader plans for growth. Woods has made natural gas a priority since he took the helm in January, and the company recently spent $5.6 billion to snap up shale assets in Texas and New Mexico. Exxon's press release announcing the jobs focused on the money to be made exporting chemicals linked to shale gas -- not on Trump. "These projects are export machines, generating products that high-growth nations need to support larger populations with higher standards of living," Woods said. "Those overseas markets are the motivation behind our investments." Still, Woods gave the White House a hat tip in a statement circulated by the president's team. "Investments of this scale require a pro-growth approach and a stable regulatory environment and we appreciate the President's commitment to both," Woods said. Intel On Feb. 8, Intel (INTC, Tech30) CEO Brian Krzanich announced at the White House that the tech giant would invest $7 billion in a new Arizona factory, creating 10,000 related jobs. What Trump said: Trump said at a press conference after the announcement that Intel "will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that it was probably never going to move ahead with, and that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs." Trump also promoted the Intel news at a joint press conference with the Canadian prime minister. Trump said Intel is "coming in with billions and billions of dollars of investment and thousands and thousands of jobs" because he's moved to lower taxes and decrease regulation. The facts: The new computer chip factory will directly create about 3,000 "high-paying, high-wage, high-tech" jobs at its peak, according to Krzanich. In total, it will support more than 10,000 related jobs in the state. The investment was made "in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward," Krzanich said from the Oval Office. But the project isn't entirely Trump's doing. In fact, Intel previously announced a $5 billion investment in the same Arizona chip factory with former President Barack Obama in 2011. That money was used to build the "shell" of the factory, but it was left unfinished because of a lack of "general demand for the product," according to company spokesman William Moss. The project is resuming now that demand is picking up again. "We're making this investment now to meet demand that we now expect," Moss told CNNMoney. "That said, we certainly join other companies in supporting the administration's pro-business and pro-investment goals." General Motors (Part One) On Jan. 17, General Motors (GM) announced plans to invest at least $1 billion in U.S. factories. The company also committed to creating or retaining about 7,000 U.S. jobs in the next few years. What Trump said: Trump, then the president-elect, gave GM and Walmart a shout-out via Twitter the day of the announcement, thanking the companies "for starting the big jobs push back into the U.S.!" The facts: GM plans to shift 450 jobs from supplier plants in Mexico back to the U.S., and has pledged to protect 1,500 factory jobs that were previously at risk of leaving the country. GM is also adding 5,000 jobs to its finance and technology operations. Details will be rolled out later this year. The company didn't mention Trump in its announcement. "As the U.S. manufacturing base increases its competitiveness, we are able to further increase our investment, resulting in more jobs for America and better results for our owners," GM CEO Mary Barra said in a statement. These plans have been in the works for some time, according to a company executive, and aren't part of any arrangement with President Trump. Still, GM has been eager to show the new administration that it's serious about domestic job creation. Trump has attacked the automaker for making cars in Mexico and threatened to hit its imports with a "big" border tax. Barra serves on Trump's economic advisory council. Walmart On Jan. 17, Walmart (WMT), which employs more workers than any other American business, said it would add 10,000 U.S. jobs this year. What Trump said: Trump offered praise for Walmart in the tweet about GM. The facts: Walmart will add 10,000 jobs by expanding, renovating or relocating 59 Walmart and Sam's Club stores. It's also expanding online services. In addition, the project will create 24,000 temporary construction jobs, the company said. Walmart didn't mention Trump in its announcement. "With a presence in thousands of communities and a vast supplier network, we know we play an important role in supporting and creating American jobs," Walmart executive Dan Bartlett said in a statement. It's unclear whether Trump or his policies affected the decision, announced days before the inauguration. Walmart declined to comment. CEO Doug McMillon serves on Trump's economic advisory council. Lockheed Martin On Jan. 13, defense giant Lockheed Martin (LMT) said it would add 1,800 jobs to its F-35 fighter jet program in Texas. What Trump said: Trump mentioned Lockheed Martin's job creation in a Jan. 18 tweet. He said the jobs "came back because of me!" The facts: Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson told reporters about the new jobs while leaving a meeting at with the president-elect at Trump Tower. She said Lockheed is "close to a deal" that will bring down the cost of the F-35 and bring "thousands and thousands of jobs" to the U.S. Trump criticized the cost of Lockheed Martin's F-35 program in late December. He said "the tremendous cost and cost overruns" led him to ask Boeing to price a comparable jet. Lockheed stock dropped. Lockheed has every reason to charm Trump: It is the largest U.S. government contractor, according to the most recent most recent data. But these new jobs would have been added with or without him. The positions Hewson announced are linked to production increases that have been in motion for years, a Lockheed spokesman told CNNMoney. Lockheed plans to deliver 150 jets in 2019, compared with 36 aircraft in 2014. Amazon On Jan. 12, Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) announced plans to create more than 100,000 U.S. jobs in the next 18 months. What Trump said: "The announcement was made after the president-elect met with heads of several other tech companies and urge them to keep their jobs and production inside the United States," Sean Spicer, the incoming press secretary, said on a call with reporters that day. "The president-elect was pleased to have played a role in that decision by Amazon." The facts: Amazon didn't mention Trump in its press release. "Innovation is one of our guiding principles at Amazon, and it's created hundreds of thousands of American jobs," Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement. "These jobs are not just in our Seattle headquarters or in Silicon Valley -- they're in our customer service network, fulfillment centers and other facilities in local communities throughout the country." Amazon would probably add tens of thousands of jobs regardless of who is president. The e-commerce company is growing rapidly, and Amazon adds fulfillment centers each year to expand its shipping operations. "The bottom line is they were going to create jobs anyway, but it's the messaging that has changed," James Cakmak, an analyst with Monness, Crespi, Hardt, told CNNMoney. This announcement "appears to calibrate to current political sensitivities." During the campaign, Trump repeatedly took on Bezos. He said once that Amazon is "getting away with murder tax-wise." Chinese tech giant Alibaba On Jan. 9, Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba (BABA, Tech30), met with Trump and promised to help create 1 million jobs in the U.S. through the company's e-commerce platforms. What Trump said: Ma "had no intention of doing it until I got elected," Trump said in an interview with Fox News. He also said Alibaba and other companies will spend a "tremendous amount of money" in the United States. The facts: Ma is on record as early as 2015 saying he wanted to create U.S. jobs by helping businesses sell American goods to China, and Asia generally, on Alibaba's e-commerce platform. After the January meeting, a reporter asked whether Ma and Trump talked about any investments in the U.S. "No," Ma replied. "We specifically talked about ... supporting 1 million businesses, especially in the Midwest of America." Alibaba's pledge to help create 1 million jobs in the U.S. is vague and misleading. Ma is not going to build factories. He is not planning to set up Alibaba operations centers that would employ tech-savvy Americans. And he is not touting a big investment. In other words, Ma isn't promising what most experts would define as job creation. He's talking about stimulating trade by helping 1 million small businesses sell American goods in China and Asia. Why the Midwest? Chinese consumers want more foreign food supplements and baby goods -- think milk products from a farm in Wisconsin. Fiat Chrysler On Jan. 8, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU) announced a $1 billion investment to expand factories in Ohio and Michigan, spurring the creation of 2,000 jobs by 2020. What Trump said: "It's finally happening - Fiat Chrysler just announced plans to invest $1BILLION in Michigan and Ohio plants, adding 2000 jobs," Trump tweeted the next day. The facts: The announcement is the latest phase in an "industrialization plan" the company announced a year ago. In a 2015 deal with the United Auto Workers union, the company committed to investing $5.3 billion in American plants to open up additional union jobs. Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne said at a press conference that the decision was neither a response to Trump's pressure on the auto industry nor an effort to avoid Trump's ire. "I wish I could give him credit for this," Marchionne told reporters. "But the thinking was in place beforehand." Still, Trump's public criticism of GM and Ford factories in Mexico has surely made Fiat Chrysler and its investors wary. Marchionne called it "incredibly imprudent" for Chrysler to invest in Mexico until the industry gets some clarity on tariff threats. Ford On Jan. 3, Ford (F) announced that the company is canceling plans to build a plant in Mexico. Instead, the carmaker will invest $700 million in Michigan to create 700 U.S. jobs. What Trump said: Trump hailed Ford's decision on Twitter the next day. "Thank you to Ford for scrapping a new plant in Mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the U.S.," he tweeted. "This is just the beginning - much more to follow." After Fiat Chrysler's announcement the following week, the president-elect applauded Ford again. "Ford said last week that it will expand in Michigan and U.S. instead of building a BILLION dollar plant in Mexico," he tweeted. "Thank you Ford & Fiat C!" The facts: The Ford Focus will now be built at an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico, and the $700 million investment in Ford's Flat Rock, Michigan, plant will allow the company to ramp up production of electric and self-driving cars. Ford CEO Mark Fields said the investment is a "vote of confidence" in the pro-business environment Trump is working to foster. However, he stressed that Ford did not negotiate a deal with the president-elect. "We didn't cut a deal with Trump," Fields told CNN's Poppy Harlow. "We did it for our business." Falling small car sales probably played a major role. At the same time, Trump's unrelenting criticism of Ford on the campaign trail could have been a factor. Last year, Ford announced that it would invest $1.6 billion to transfer production of the Focus from Michigan to Mexico as a cost-saving move. Trump repeatedly blasted the automaker for sending U.S. jobs to Mexico (Ford said no jobs would be lost because of the move) and threatened to place a 35% tariff on Ford vehicles made in Mexico and sold in the U.S. Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank On Dec. 6, after meeting with Trump, SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son pledged to invest $50 billion and create 50,000 jobs. What Trump said: The president immediately claimed credit, tweeting, "Masa said he would never do this had we not won the election!" The facts: Before the election, SoftBank (SFTBF)and the government of Saudi Arabia said they were forming a $100 billion fund to invest in tech companies around the world. Son told The Wall Street Journal that the money he promised to Trump would come from the SoftBank Vision Fund. A SoftBank spokesman disputed that Son said the investment would come entirely from the Vision Fund, saying, "it is a commitment from SoftBank." SoftBank announced it would pump $1 billion into Florida startup OneWeb on Dec. 19, a move it said would create 3,000 jobs over the next four years. The company described the investment as "the first step" in Son's promise to Trump. But it is not clear how much of the huge investment would have ended up in the U.S. regardless of who won the White House. The OneWeb deal wasn't cobbled together after the election. Softbank had been in talks with the startup for "a long time," said SoftBank spokesman Matthew Nicholson. Sprint, which is also owned by SoftBank, confirmed late last year that it would "create or bring back to America" 5,000 jobs, also part of Son's commitment to create 50,000 jobs. Carrier On Nov. 30, air conditioning, heating and refrigeration company Carrier said it cut a deal with the incoming Trump administration to keep jobs in Indiana from moving to Mexico. What Trump said: Trump touted his team's involvement in the Carrier deal from the start. "I am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana)," he tweeted on Nov. 24. "MAKING PROGRESS." Once the deal was inked, Trump visited the plant to claim a victory. "Carrier stepped it up, and now they're keeping -- actually, the number is over 1,100 people," he said. "Which is so great." The facts: The company said the deal was possible because the incoming administration emphasized "its commitment to support the business community and create an improved, more competitive U.S. business climate." It also credits an incentive package offered by the state of Indiana. Carrier says the agreement really saved 800 jobs -- not 1,100 -- from moving to Mexico. The company confirmed to CNNMoney that it never planned to move 300 administrative and engineering positions from Indianapolis. Carrier will receive $7 million in financial incentives from the state of Indiana over the next 10 years -- a fraction of what Carrier expected to save if it moved the jobs to Mexico. Carrier's parent company, United Technologies (UTX), is a major defense contractor.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Uber Halts Self-Driving Cars After Arizona Crash PUBLISHED: MARCH 27 2017 Uber suspended its pilot program testing self-driving cars after one of the vehicles was involved in an accident in Arizona, the company said Saturday. The accident happened when a self-driving Volvo XC90 sport-utility vehicle was struck by another vehicle that failed to yield when making a left turn. The SUV overturned and struck a third vehicle. No serious injuries were reported, police said. The Uber vehicle was not at fault for the accident, officers said. The ride-sharing company has been testing self-driving cars in Tempe, Ariz., Pittsburgh and California for months as it undertakes one of the most ambitious autonomous vehicle projects in the country. Uber was forced to halt its California pilot project when the city of San Francisco and the state revoked vehicle registrations after a permitting dispute. The company has since applied for the state autonomous vehicle permit and has put two such cars back on the road there. While technically self-driving, all of Uber's pilot vehicles have a driver behind the wheel who can take over control of the vehicle at any time. In Saturday's crash, the driver was the only individual inside and the SUV was operating in autonomous mode. The company released a statement on the incident, saying they are "looking into" what happened. They did not offer a timetable for when the self-driving vehicles would return to the road. © 2017 UPI Top Stories under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

Google Offers Android O Preview Next Article > Samsung Needs Galaxy S8 Phone To Impress, Mend Its Reputation PUBLISHED: MARCH 28 2017 The Galaxy S8 will feature Samsung's Bixby virtual personal assistant. Samsung will on Wednesday [March 29] hold an event in New York, which will be live-streamed around the world, to launch its flagship Galaxy S8. The South Korean electronics company needs to repair its brand perception as a viable smartphone manufacturer after its flagship phablet device, the Galaxy Note 7 [pictured above], had to be recalled last year and eventually cancelled after a fault in battery design led to the smartphones catching fire. The launch of the S8 was pushed out by a few months. Samsung's new handsets are normally launched in February every year at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. This year, the company apparently wanted to fully resolve the battery issues that led to the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco. Information officially released by the firm, and a series of leaks from Korean-based tech blogs, have given customers a glimpse into what to expect this week. Bixby, which will be included in the S8. Bixby is the firm's Siri and Google Assistant equivalent. The virtual personal assistant (VPA) will supposedly be more conversational than Apple's Siri and ask follow-up questions if it did not understand the request. Samsung says Bixby will let users control compatible apps via voice only. In Apple's latest update, Siri can interact with other apps, like order an Uber, but users still have to physically touch the phone at some part in the process to complete the order. Adverts for the Galaxy S8 launch have been taking up prime-time slots on television for the past few weeks. The ads feature a black screen with two white lines that outline the top and bottom of the device. This suggests the S8 will have a small bezel -- the space between the screen and edge of the device -- and no home button. This is in line with previously reported leaks. The company also released an advert in January to show off its new super AMOLED display in South Korea. The video features an unreleased device with small bezels which is suspected to be the S8. The rumors Various leaks suggest there will be two versions of the S8 unveiled this week: one with the standard 5.7-inch display and the second with a larger 6.2-inch screen. The curved 'Edge' display that previously appeared on the S6 and S7 is said to have been done away with. Both S8 smartphones will have flat screens. As there will be no home screen button at the bottom of the screen, it is rumoured the fingerprint sensor will be embedded into the screen or at the back of the device. The S8 is expected to be one of the first phones to market with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 835 processor. Both the S8 smartphone models will allegedly keep the 3.5mm headphone jack, which Apple controversially decided not to include in its iPhone 7 range last year. An updated version of the virtual reality headset, the Gear VR, and the Samsung 360 camera are also expected to be announced this week. © 2017 ITWeb under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Graham being led to the Bay County Jail on Monday, March 27, 2017. (Cole Waterman | The Bay City Times) Print Email Cole Waterman | cwaterma@mlive.com By Cole Waterman | cwaterma@mlive.com The Bay City Times Follow on Twitter on March 27, 2017 at 9:46 AM, updated March 28, 2017 at 7:43 AM comments BAY CITY, MI -- A 56-year-old woman is heading to jail for crashing into a little girl in a Walmart parking lot, then driving away from the scene. Bay County Circuit Judge Joseph K. Sheeran on Monday, March 27, sentenced Elicia E. Graham to 183 days in jail. Upon release, Graham is to be on probation for three years. The judge deferred an additional 182 days, meaning Graham will only have to serve them if she violates her probation. While on probation, she is not to drive or consume alcohol. The judge gave her no credit for time served. Graham in February pleaded no contest to one count of attempted assault with a dangerous weapon. The charge is a two-year high court misdemeanor. In exchange, the prosecution dismissed single counts of operating a motor vehicle while license suspended, revoked or denied causing injury and failure to stop at the scene of a collision resulting in serious impairment or death. Graham's crime occurred the afternoon of Dec. 9, 2015. Andrew Bailor in an April preliminary examination testified he and his 8-year-old daughter, Trinity Bailor, visited the Walmart at 3921 E. Wilder Road in Bangor Township to do some shopping. Bailor was driving his 2005 Lincoln Aviator as he scouted for a parking spot. Girl, 8, testifies car 'disappeared' after striking her at Walmart The Bailors found a spot, but it had a shopping cart in it. Trinity exited the Aviator and was moving the cart to a nearby corral when Graham struck her. Graham briefly stopped her vehicle, then took off. Trinity suffered three broken fingers, a broken thumb, two severed fingertips, missing fingernails, and road rash on her back and leg, her dad testified. Michigan State Police reviewed Walmart's surveillance camera footage, which captured the collision. With help from the store's Loss Prevention officers, troopers identified Graham as the offending driver, as she had made a debit card purchase just before the incident.  Woman, 55, charged with 2 felonies in hit-and-run of child in Walmart lot Graham's sentencing guidelines ranged from zero to six months. Sheeran said the guidelines did not take into consideration Graham's prior three drunken driving convictions, and a conviction of failing to report an accident to fixtures. Defense attorney James F. Gust asked Sheeran to allow his client work release, but the judge denied the request. "I feel real bad about this whole ordeal," Graham said, just before the judge imposed his sentence. "I'm so sorry." "Why'd you leave?" Sheeran asked her. "I thought I struck a cart," she replied. "I had no idea there was anyone involved." The Bailors were not present to give victim impact statements.  Countdown to Tigers' opener April 3 Over/under on Tigers wins well behind Indians Ausmus: Norris must work through mental hurdle of 'dead arm' Castellanos batting second or fifth: Which benefits Tigers more?

The simplest measure is a basket of firms that have the highest effective tax rates, including Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. and Alliance Data Systems Corp. If the chances for passing cuts to corporate rates rise, so too will these shares. Retailers, meanwhile, hold clues on the fortunes of the border adjustment tax. If the likes of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. start to falter, that’d be a clue that the measure is gaining traction. Handicapping the political wrangling in Washington has taken on more importance after the health bill’s failure raised concerns the administration’s pro-growth policies won’t sail through Congress. For investors forced to parse the meaning of of D.C. infighting, the collective wisdom of the market has taken on the role of soothsayer. “These trades depend on what the market’s anticipation has been in the past, and a lot can be gleaned from whether they gel or unravel,” said John Manley, who helps oversee about $233 billion as chief equity strategist for Wells Fargo Funds Management in New York. “People work so hard trying to use things to predict the stock market -- it’s interesting to see people using stocks to predict things outside of it.” For now, investors have turned cold on the prospects for tax reform, at least any time soon. A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. index of 50 highly taxed stocks fell as much as 1 percent Monday before finishing little changed after its worst week in 13 months. The group surged as much as 14 percent after the election, but is now down 2.8 percent in the month of March. “The defeat of the health bill indicates that complex and controversial tax reforms are likely to be difficult to pass,” a group of Goldman economists led by Alec Phillips wrote in a note to clients on Monday. That sentiment’s having the opposite effect on apparel and multi-line retail companies, whose reliance on overseas manufacturing makes them particularly exposed to any border-adjustment tax. The centerpiece of the House Republican tax proposal would likely raise supply costs, making the prospect for legislative gridlock a positive. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up The group, which Goldman said in mid-February had the “most to lose” from the border tax, was little changed on Monday, clinging to a third straight monthly advance. It’s getting some relief from preemptive selling that saw an S&P 500 index of retailers fall 1.7 percent last week, the biggest decline of the year. L Brands Inc., Foot Locker Inc. and Abercrombie & Fitch Co. rose at least 0.2 percent. Wal-Mart edged higher. “Watching Congress lack the backbone to make changes to the ACA reminded us how difficult tax reform could be,” Daniel Clifton, head of policy research at Strategas Partners, wrote in a client note on Monday.

Hot Topics: Man who set himself on fire dies Lafayette suicides Pomerance: End of Boulder? Chautauqua parking changes Sanctuary cities News tips Print   Email   Font Resize Man who lit himself on fire outside Lafayette Walmart dies Man asked bystanders to film him, cited FBI harassment as reason for self-immolation By Anthony Hahn Staff Writer Posted:   03/27/2017 07:50:59 PM MDT Updated:   03/27/2017 10:34:50 PM MDT Firefighters look over the burned car in the Lafayette Walmart parking lot on Sunday. (Paul Aiken / Staff Photographer) Related Stories Mar 27: Lafayette suicides spotlight increased mental health concerns Mar 26: Man lights himself, car on fire in Lafayette Walmart parking lot The man who set himself and his car on fire in the parking lot of Lafayette's Walmart in front of dozens of horrified shoppers has died, Lafayette police Chief Rick Bashor said Monday. The man, whose identity has not been released, started driving around the parking lot in a beige Toyota Corolla shortly after 5:20 p.m. Sunday, and asked witnesses to film him as he set himself on fire, police said. He cited years of harassment from the FBI as the reason for his self-immolation, according to video of the incident filmed by a bystander at the man's request. The Daily Camera has viewed the video, which was taken moments after the man was extinguished by bystanders and was still awaiting medical assistance, but has chosen not to release the footage due to its graphic content. "I got in trouble 11 years ago, and ever since (the FBI has) been completely harassing me," the man told a visibly upset onlooker. "They never let me sleep. All I'm doing is trying to make ends meet and all they're trying to do is (expletive) with me." Prior to that footage being filmed, the man stopped near the store entrance, doused himself with gasoline inside the car and lit himself and the car on fire, Lafayette police said. The man then got out of the car and yelled at bystanders not to extinguish the fire. Advertisement Several citizens put out the flames by covering the man with jackets, according to footage in a separate video. David Bach, who was shopping at Walmart at the time and took the video showing the man's statement, said the minutes following the incident were filled with panic and confusion. "I heard a lady screaming and sprinting into the store and my first reaction was that someone had a gun," Bach said Monday. "I expected to see someone hit with a car or having a heart attack. "What I saw was a man completely engulfed in flames slowly walking across the parking lot with his hands up." After several bystanders were able to extinguish the flames, Bach said the man was left completely alone while people tried to put out the still-burning car. "I thought that it was wrong for him to be sitting there alone in that state," Bach said. "He was sitting Indian-style and was completely coherent. All his skin and clothes had burned off and he was smoldering. "He said, 'I want you to record me and I want to get my message out,'" Bach said. The man stated that he had fallen into trouble with the FBI more than a decade ago and had been harassed ever since, according to the video. The Camera could not verify the claims made in the video. "It was all very disturbing," Bach said. "The fact that someone could get to that point in their life and in their head where they would do something that drastic is just sad and disturbing." Tanja Carter, a witness who saw the man after he was pulled from the car, said Sunday that he was burned from head to toe.

Kushner said over the weekend: “The government should be run like a great American company.” Sorry, can’t happen. It’s literally an impossibility. Let us explore the many reasons why: First, government gets its “revenues” by force. It taxes everyone that happens to reside on the turf that government calls its own. If those individuals do not hand over their money, they run the risk of being thrown into a cage by the government. What a way to generate “revenue.” No wonder so many misfits are attracted to this way of life. Companies, on the other hand, must earn their revenues. Individual consumers must voluntarily hand over their money to the company in exchange for a product or service. Each consumer has the ability to say “No” to the transaction. If a consumer doesn’t like Wal-Mart or McDonald’s, they are free to never (ever) step foot in either establishment. Wal-Mart and McDonald’s are completely powerless to do anything about it. They can’t lay a finger on you, let alone throw you in a cage. When it comes to government, however, a taxpayer can HATE Donald Trump, Barack Obama, or George W. Bush with a venomous passion, and it doesn’t matter one bit. You can scream and shout until your voice box collapses, but you willcough up your taxes. Otherwise, off to the the cage you go. Companies go out of business all the time. It’s very difficult to satisfy consumers profitably. Consumers are extremely fickle, always looking for the best deal. Consumers always want it cheaper, faster, and better. If a company is not able to keep their finger on the pulse of ever-changing consumer desires, they have to close their doors. There is no incentive for failure. Government, on the other hand, thrives on failure. When government fails, the incident is used as an excuse to take more money from the taxpayers. Budgets go up! The exact opposite of market incentives. The federal budget goes in one direction: UP. Republicans?….UP….Democrats?….UP…. This bizzaro setup cannot be “fixed.” It can’t be “tweaked” to work more efficiently. Government doesn’t have market signals like profits and losses. Companies can quickly see what consumers really want versus what they don’t. Profit and loss statements cannot lie. Government is all political. No profit & loss statements. It’s pretty much all lies. This is why government should have very few (and almost no) responsibilities. Ideally, it would be so insignificant that you forget it even exists. That’s at least how it originally was in the “land of the free.” Unfortunately, after 240+ years, the “land of the free” has morphed into a land where government is viewed as a Mommy or Daddy. It’s expected to be in charge of every photon and electron. Not even private conversations are allowed outside of its watchful eye. While the market, when left alone, will weed out failed companies, Government keeps crony companies in business! The market is ruthless. It shows no mercy. You either satisfy your customers profitably or you’re gone. There is no “too big to fail,” or “too small to fail,” or anything in between. This is a major reason why crony corporations hate the free market. It’s extremely hard. It’s much easier to buy a politician. Crony corporations get bailed out and continue to operate at everyone’s expense. Many get bailed out knowing full well that they’re going to be bailed out again in the future. So they live it up with reckless abandon at all times. Do you thing major Wall Street firms and Military-Industrial Complex corporations are worried? Government cannot be made to work like a “great company.” There’s a better chance of seeing a wide open field of unicorns. The only thing that can be done is for someone to come in and abolish, slash, and cut. Everything gets cut across the board, and it has to be done over, and over, and over. That’s not Trump and that’s not Kushner. That’s also not what Americans want right now. The belief in government omnipotence is still very strong. After all, Trump is a BIG government guy. He doesn’t hide it.  Liberty, freedom, individual rights, private property, voluntary interactions…These are not the words that ever come out of his mouth.  Trump is in office to shuffle the deck chairs on the U.S. Titanic. When Trump’s term is over, the federal budget will be higher, the federal debt will be much higher, the welfare state will continue to asphyxiate the American taxpayer, and God only knows what wars he’s going to drag us into. When Americans can someday clearly understand the difference between government and “a great company” we’ll have reason to be optimistic. ​When government is no longer viewed as Mommy or Daddy, we’ll have reason to cheer. We’re not there yet. http://www.ronpaullibertyreport.com/archives/nogovernment-cant-be-run-like-a-great-american-company Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

Puts Its Cashier-Less Grocery Concept on Hold Disrupting Wal-Mart's proven grocery model won't be easy. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Mar 27, 2017 at 7:03PM In December 2016, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) wrapped up the year with the surprise launch of a small convenience-style grocery store concept with a checkout-free shopping experience the e-commerce giant called, "Just Walk Out Shopping." The technology signaled Amazon's ever-expanding ambition to grab market share from retailers -- this time from grocers. But Amazon's plans have fallen flat, according to a new report from The Wall Street Journal. Technological problems mean the store will remain only a concept for now. Amazon Go. Image source: Amazon.com. What is Amazon Go? Amazon's check-out free grocery experience, which the company calls Amazon Go, first launched as a beta program for its employees. Measuring 1,800 square feet of retail space, the store offered ready-to-eat meals and snacks, as well as grocery essentials. But the major selling point of Amazon Go was its Just Walk Out Shopping technology. Amazon's website explained: Our checkout-free shopping experience is made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning. Our Just Walk Out Technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you're done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we'll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt. Amazon planned to launch public versions of the store in "early 2017," the website said. Amazon employees reportedly had ambitious plans for the stores and this new technology. The company envisioned "opening more than 2,000 brick-and-mortar grocery stores under its name, depending on the success of the new test locations," the Journal reported last December. An underwhelming start But with "early 2017" nearly over as the second calendar quarter draws closer, Amazon has delayed plans for a public launch of Amazon Go, the Journal said this week, citing "people familiar with the matter." Further, there's no longer a timetable for the expected launch of the new store. The delay is because of problems with Amazon's Just Walk Out Shopping technology, the sources told the Journal. Specifically, the Journal says Amazon has had issues with tracking transactions when over 20 people are in the store. As Amazon fumbles with its first major attempt at a small grocery concept, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is seeing some success from its own approach to making grocery shopping easier: curbside pickup of online orders. In the company's most recent earnings call, Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said the service's sales increased 27% year over year over the holidays. Similarly, curbside pickup of orders made online at Wal-Mart's Sam's Club increased 25% year over year during the fourth quarter. Unlike Amazon.com's sentiment toward its new Amazon Go technology, Wal-Mart is optimistic about its progress with curbside pickup. "Customers love being able to order an item with an app and get it that day," McMillon said. Of course, if Amazon can make the Amazon Go technology work, it could be more disruptive than Wal-Mart's more conservative bets on same-day pickup of online orders. But Amazon's initial headwinds in brick-and-mortar grocery show that disrupting giants like Wal-Mart won't happen easily. Daniel Sparks has no position in any stocks mentioned.

It's also easy to take a cynical view and question why Jeff Bezos' company is bothering, considering how far it has gotten with the help of the cost and convenience advantages provided by its online sales model. Both attitudes might be misguided, however. As Bezos is undoubtedly aware, physical retail is a very different game from e-commerce, and both figuring out its nuances and learning to scale a retail footprint to feature hundreds (never mind thousands) of stores is bound to take time and involve some growing pains. However, for a company with Amazon's tremendous scale and fulfillment infrastructure, there is a strong rationale for going in this direction, provided it's selective about the battles it chooses to fight. Over the weekend, The New York Times reported Amazon is thinking of creating stores that would sell large, heavy goods such as furniture and home appliances, which consumers like to view in person before buying. As part of the effort, Amazon is reportedly thinking of "using forms of augmented or virtual reality to allow people to see how couches, stoves and credenzas will look in their homes." The company is also said to be mulling an "electronics-store concept" similar to Apple's  (AAPL) retail stores, and which (naturally) would heavily emphasize Amazon's own hardware. And in India, where Amazon has promised to invest $5 billion and much of the grocery market is still dominated by small stores, the company is thinking of launching grocery stores. In the U.S., Amazon has already opened up several small bookstores that double as Amazon hardware showrooms, and let Prime subscribers buy items for the same prices as which the company sells them online. It has also created pop-up kiosk stores (said to be temporary) within 29 malls that show off the company's hardware. Amazon has also unveiled its Go convenience store concept, which (with the help of cameras, sensors and algorithms) will let customers buy items and leave without ever standing in a checkout line. However, The Wall Street Journal just reported Amazon has delayed the launch of the first Go store, originally set for the end of March, due to a need to fix issues in the technology used to automatically charge customers when they leave. Amazon's U.S. grocery store efforts also seem to cover drive-up locations for picking up orders made via the AmazonFresh grocery service. The New York Times says the company has also "explored another grocery store concept that could serve walk-in customers and act as a hub for home deliveries." In December, the Wall Street Journal reported Amazon's tech team approved a proposal to open "large, multifunction stores with curbside pickup capability," and that it envisions opening over 2,000 bricks-and-mortar grocery stores if its test locations succeed. However, the company soon responded by saying it currently has "no plans to open 2,000 of anything." Taking all of these reports and announcements in aggregate, a few things become clear: Amazon is generally focusing on retail products which many consumers prefer to buy in physical stores, and/or for which shipping challenges limit the effectiveness of online sales. The exception to this rule is Amazon's own electronics hardware, which the company seems driven to promote in physical venues to strengthen its brand, and perhaps also further hook consumers on the Amazon services supported by its hardware. Amazon still isn't sure what it wants to do in many cases, and is thus kicking a lot of tires. In those cases where Amazon has some idea about what it wants to do, it's still often in trial-and-error mode when it comes to the details. Groceries are a good case in point. The weight of many grocery items, along with the need to keep many of them refrigerated or frozen, guarantees that a very large percentage of grocery sales will happen offline for the foreseeable future. As does the fact that consumers prefer to check out many perishable groceries in person before buying them, and often want items in their hands immediately rather than the next day. But as the various store concepts it's exploring show, Amazon is still mulling how best to attack this market, where Wal-Mart, Target (TGT) , supermarket chains such as Kroger (KR) , discount chains such as Aldi and upscale chains such as Whole Foods all loom large. And both the Go store's delayed launch and limited initial selection show how even a bricks-and-mortar project that has been well-hyped the company is in its early innings. Likewise, many consumers still like to visit physical bookstores and page through the merchandise before deciding on something to buy. And the extended amounts of time a lot of them spend while visiting bookstores makes them a good place to promote Fire tablets and Echo speakers. But so far, the November 2015 launch of Amazon's first bookstore has only been followed by four more openings (five more are under construction). Whether it's trying to sell books, vegetables, sofas or refrigerators, the dozens of fulfillment centers Amazon has built out over the U.S. for its e-commerce operations make it much easier for the company to cost-effectively run a bricks-and-mortar operation. As does its burgeoning logistics investments, which cover everything from truck trailers to a shipping fleet to an air cargo hub. Meanwhile, as the bookstores show, Amazon can use a Prime subscriber base believed to top 60 million to drive demand for the stores, while also using store discounts and promotions as one more means of keeping Prime members loyal. Other potential benefits include giving some of Amazon's third-party sellers another distribution channel, and of increasing the company's total (physical plus online) scale to gain more purchasing power with suppliers and lower its per-unit fulfillment and infrastructure costs. On the other hand, as Wal-Mart is aware, optimizing an infrastructure for online sales isn't always the same as doing so for bricks-and-mortar sales. And as Amazon has to know, it can be a lot harder to profitably sell an item at a particular price in a physical store than it can be online, given all the overhead involved. Throw in all the time it takes to get the details right for things like a store concept's locations, size, layout, merchandise selection and customer interactions, and it's very much in Amazon's interests to move cautiously. Such caution, however, shouldn't be taken as a sign that the company doesn't once more have big ambitions. Get an email alert each time I write an article for Real Money.

A man outside a Colorado Walmart yelled for bystanders to watch him Sunday before igniting gasoline he had poured over himself and the car he was in, according to multiple reports. >> Read more trending news The man, who appeared to be in his 60s, sustained second- and third-degree burns before bystanders were able to put out the flames, Lafayette police Cmdr. Brian Rosipajla and police dispatchers told the Daily Camera. The man stopped a car outside the entrance to the Walmart at 745 U.S. Highway 287 in Lafayette around 5:20 p.m. Sunday, police said. He shouted for the attention of passers-by and told them to videotape him before he doused himself and the car in gas and lit himself on fire, the Daily Camera reported. He was engulfed in flames by the time he got out of the car, spread his arms and told bystanders not to extinguish the fire, according to KDVR. Bystanders ignored him and put out the fire covering him, although they were unable to stop the car fire, police said. Rosipajla told the Daily Camera the man’s injuries were critical.

News Business Business News YouTube could lose up to $750m from advertisers' boycott over extremist content More than 250 companies, including Verizon, Johnson & Johnson and HSBC have already suspended contracts with Google Zlata Rodionova Monday 27 March 2017 19:04 BST Click to follow The Independent Online YouTube relies extensively on big brands and could take a 7.5 per cent hit to its revenues YouTube’s revenue could take a $750m hit as a result of dozens of multinationals suspending advertising contracts with the Google-owned video platform, according to analysts at one bank. More than 250 companies, including Marks & Spencer, Toyota and HSBC have already suspended contracts with Google, accusing the technology giant of allowing their adverts to appear next to controversial content on YouTube. In a note to clients published on Monday, analysts at Nomura Instinet said that the list of those who have stopped advertising includes five of the top 20 US advertisers: AT&T, General Motors, Verizon, Walmart and Johnson & Johnson. Read more Verizon, AT&T and Johnson & Johnson suspend advertising on Google Together those companies represent 7.5 per cent of the total US ad market and the analysts said that YouTube could take a 7.5 per cent (or about $750m) hit to its previous gross revenue forecast of $10.2bn for 2017 as a result of the contracts being suspended. They said that YouTube is capable of introducing measures that would remedy brand safety concerns but that this would not prevent the company from being hit financially. Crisis, brand and reputation management expert Eric Schiffer, told the Independent  that the controversy could hit Google's earnings in the short term. Read more Google announces measures to crack down on extremist ad placement Google apologises over adverts placed next to extremist YouTube videos YouTube admits that it hides LGBT videos after protests Big banks ditch Google over extremist YouTube videos However he added: "Google is also best positioned to put the kiss of death to online hate because of their mastery at determining the relevancy of content […]. They will do their best to asphyxiate hate merchants, and in the process, 90 per cent of brands which left will return to the fold within one to three months." The controversy around ads erupted after an investigation by the Times in February found that content from major brands was appearing near YouTube videos promoting extremist views, which were generating revenue for the creators.

It was the most valuabe financial brand in the world in 2016 replacing Wells Fargo Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, last week wrote in a blog post on the company’s website that Google the company had started to ramp up changes around “ad policies, our enforcement of these policies and new controls for advertisers”. “We know advertisers don’t want their ads next to content that doesn’t align with their values. So starting today, we’re taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content,” he wrote. “This includes removing ads more effectively from content that is attacking or harassing people based on their race, religion, gender or similar categories. This change will enable us to take action, where appropriate, on a larger set of ads and sites,” he added.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Amazon Go puts the future on temporary hold Chris Burns - Mar 27, 2017 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit While generally I’d write and article about how “Amazon Go” is delayed with an understanding with our readers that they’d read previous articles, today we’re in a unique position. Today with news that there’s are “technical complications” in the store, according to WSJ, I’m going to discuss the implications of this delay. This delay is happening for a store which will eventually allow people to enter, pick up items as needed, and walk out without seeing or interacting with a cashier. Amazon wants to invent something that already exists, creating a store where the least pleasant part about shopping with introverts is removed. Stores like Walmart and Target – and basically every chain grocery store – now have self-checkout consoles already. I can walk in to a store, find what I want, buy it, and leave without ever interacting directly with another person, if I want. The image directly above this paragraph is not from the “Amazon Go” store – it’s from Sam’s Club. A bulk sales store owned by the same folks as own Walmart, Sam’s Club has an app with which users can scan items with the camera on their phone, add them to a list on their phone, buy them, and show the resulting receipt to the door worker on the way out to verify. The verification process is the same as it is with a more traditional purchase at Sam’s Club – there’s always a receipt check due to the massive nature of the shopping carts and big room for accidental hiding of items. Sam’s Club’s mobile checkout does not alleviate the point-of-contact that needs to be made at the door of their store. But if this same process were available at their closest relative store, Walmart, it’d essentially be Amazon Go. The big difference with Amazon Go is, supposedly, the lack of a door guard – and the lack of need to scan items in the first place (at least with RFID). That’s what we’re waiting for – so very much convenience that we’ll walk into a store, pick up a banana, walk out and start to eat. A seamless experience, part of a world in the future where we might not need to interact with money at all if we don’t want to. Provided, of course, we make more than enough to provide for everything we might ever need – but that’s a long way off, and not necessarily part of Amazon’s grand plan. Have a peek at the timeline below to learn more about Amazon Go and the checkout-less stores of the future. We’ll be here – and we’ll keep on letting you know how it’s all progressing as it happens.

About 9:30, police went to the Walmart to conduct a welfare check after receiving a call about the woman in the car. Police said when they checked the vehicle, they learned the woman was dead. In a news release issued Monday, police said nothing indicated foul play was involved in her death, but they were continuing to investigate. Police withheld the woman’s name, saying they were awaiting positive identification and next of kin notifications before releasing her name or other information.

The cold chains, which are expected to come up in the next 18-24 months, could go a long way in lowering wastage of fruits and vegetables. Of the Rs 3,100 crore expected investment, the Centre would contribute around Rs 838 crore, while the remaining Rs 2,262 crore would come from the private sector. Officials said these cold chains won't be just standalone storages, but would have three distinct phases, starting with on-farm grading and sorting, followed by processing and thereby distribution to end-consumers through specially made refer vans. Announcing this decision, Food Processing Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal today said these projects would create additional capacity of 276,000 tonnes of cold storage and frozen storage capacities, 115 tonnes of Individual Quick Freezing (IQF), 5.6 million litres per day of milk processing, 210 tonnes of blast freezing and 629 refrigerated or insulated vehicles. The maximum number of cold chain projects will come up in Maharashtra at 21, followed by Uttar Pradesh 14, Gujarat 12 and Andhra Pradesh 8 projects. Punjab and Madhya Pradesh will have six projects each. "We have sanctioned 101 new cold chain projects across the country with a capacity of 276,000 tonnes. Wastages are high due to lack of cold chain infrastructure," Badal said. Of the total projects sanctioned, 53 are in fruits and vegetables sector, 33 in dairy and 15 in meat, poultry and marine. About 260,000 farmers are expected to benefit from these projects, which would also provide direct and indirect employment opportunities to 60,000 people. Badal said the number of cold chain projects sanctioned so far have gone up to 234 now and the government plans to sanction 50 more cold chain projects. In total India has over 5,300 cold chains which is highly insufficient considering that that country's total horticulture production is over 287 million tonnes. Citing a CIPHET study conducted by the ministry, Badal said the total wastage of fruits and vegetables was at Rs 92,000 crore based on the wholesale prices of 2014. She said 4.7 million tonnes of agri and horticulture produce worth Rs 12,000 crore will be processed in these cold chain projects and reduce the wastages by 13 per cent. "Farmers are producing. Our demand is growing and yet their is a wastage of fruits and vegetables," she said. As many as 308 applications were received for these 101 projects. Badal noted that the country is one of the largest food producers in the world and is the second largest producer of fruits and vegetables yet only 2.2 per cent of our fruits and vegetables are processed. The minister also said the existing cold storages are concentrated in few states and roughly 80-90 per cent are used for potatoes. Badal said the government intends to create a National Food Grid through these cold chain and mega food park projects to bring down the wastage and post-harvest losses. "We are trying to improve the supply chain from farm gate to processing to marketing," she said, while highlighting that the government had last year approved 100 per cent FDI in marketing of food products manufactured and produced in India.   Read More On Cold Chain | E-grocer | Big Basket | Haldiram | Amul | Balmer Lawrie | Harsimrat Kaur Badal | Individual Quick Freezing | Iqf | Economy & Policy | News PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY RECOMMENDED FOR YOU Advertisements The 'One' Sedan the World's Elite Prefer to Drive Banking conveinience on the go, anytime...anywhere Cover from Natural Calamities.

Of the Rs 3,100 crore expected investment, the Centre would contribute around Rs 838 crore, while the remaining Rs 2,262 crore would come from the private sector. Officials said these cold chains won't be just standalone storages, but would have three distinct phases, starting with on-farm grading and sorting, followed by processing and thereby distribution to end-consumers through specially made refer vans. Announcing this decision, Food Processing Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal today said these projects would create additional capacity of 276,000 tonnes of cold storage and frozen storage capacities, 115 tonnes of Individual Quick Freezing (IQF), 5.6 million litres per day of milk processing, 210 tonnes of blast freezing and 629 refrigerated or insulated vehicles. The maximum number of cold chain projects will come up in Maharashtra at 21, followed by Uttar Pradesh 14, Gujarat 12 and Andhra Pradesh 8 projects. Punjab and Madhya Pradesh will have six projects each. "We have sanctioned 101 new cold chain projects across the country with a capacity of 276,000 tonnes. Wastages are high due to lack of cold chain infrastructure," Badal said. Of the total projects sanctioned, 53 are in fruits and vegetables sector, 33 in dairy and 15 in meat, poultry and marine. About 260,000 farmers are expected to benefit from these projects, which would also provide direct and indirect employment opportunities to 60,000 people. Badal said the number of cold chain projects sanctioned so far have gone up to 234 now and the government plans to sanction 50 more cold chain projects. In total India has over 5,300 cold chains which is highly insufficient considering that that country's total horticulture production is over 287 million tonnes. Citing a CIPHET study conducted by the ministry, Badal said the total wastage of fruits and vegetables was at Rs 92,000 crore based on the wholesale prices of 2014. She said 4.7 million tonnes of agri and horticulture produce worth Rs 12,000 crore will be processed in these cold chain projects and reduce the wastages by 13 per cent. "Farmers are producing. Our demand is growing and yet their is a wastage of fruits and vegetables," she said. As many as 308 applications were received for these 101 projects. Badal noted that the country is one of the largest food producers in the world and is the second largest producer of fruits and vegetables yet only 2.2 per cent of our fruits and vegetables are processed. The minister also said the existing cold storages are concentrated in few states and roughly 80-90 per cent are used for potatoes. Badal said the government intends to create a National Food Grid through these cold chain and mega food park projects to bring down the wastage and post-harvest losses. "We are trying to improve the supply chain from farm gate to processing to marketing," she said, while highlighting that the government had last year approved 100 per cent FDI in marketing of food products manufactured and produced in India.   Sanjeeb Mukherjee Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Big Basket, Haldiram, Amul among 101 cold chain projects okayed Estimated investment: Rs 31,00 cr, of which Rs 838 cr to come from Centre, rest from private sector The country's largest e-grocer Big Basket, snacks biggie Haldiram, cooperative major Amul, and logistics firm Balmer Lawrie are among the 101-odd firms which reeceived the Centre's nod on Monday to set-up cold chain projects across the country entailing an investment of Rs 3,100 crore.

Where Do Those Powders in Your Smoothie Actually Come From? Where Do Those Powders in Your Smoothie Actually Come From? By Zan Romanoff Whether foraged, farmed, or grown in a lab, your medicinal herbs are probably "processed." March 27, 2017 Facebook Pinterest Email Photo by Alex Lau In seemingly no time at all, herbs like cordyceps and ashwagandha have gone from rarities in the Western world to staples at health-food stores, boutique juice spots, and, yes, even Wal-Mart. And while you can still buy plenty of herbs in capsules and tea form, it’s the loose, powdered versions from companies like Moon Juice and Sun Potion that have become de rigueur as mixers for smoothies, juices, lattes, and broths. But how are these powders made, where do the herbs come from, and how are they grown and harvested? There’s often little transparency when it comes to questions like these, despite the fact that quality and potency of the herbs can vary widely depending on the answers. We talked to some top producers about how they find, grow, and process a few of the powders you're most likely to see on the juice bar menu. They might be foraged on a mountaintop... Companies that are serious about sourcing often prefer wildcrafted—foraged as opposed to cultivated—product, because it’s believed to be more effective. “A lot of the challenges for a plant to stay alive in an extreme climate make it stronger, make its properties more potent,” Scott Linde, the founder and owner of Sun Potion, says. “Things that make plants sick, whether they're microbes or bacteria, humans are fighting those same battles. So if you have a plant that some pests got into but the plant didn't die, the plant is actually stronger than if it's in, say, a lowland area with a lot of water and coddling from the farmer." Cordyceps mushrooms are one of the most coveted and expensive herbs on the planet. Like many of the herbs that Sun Potion sells, it's known as an adaptogen: an herb that helps the body deal with the varied effects of systemic stress, however and wherever they’re being felt. It’s been used in traditional Chinese medicine (by those who could afford it) for thousands of years. To wildcraft it, you have to go to Burma or Bhutan and find caterpillars that have been naturally inoculated with cordyceps spoors; the fully-grown mushrooms fruit out of their heads "like a unicorn." “It’s certainly not vegan," Linde jokes. And the price for wildcrafted cordyceps is around $1,000 per kilo. Lab-grown cordyceps have long been available, but studies have found them to be significantly less effective than the naturally occurring kind. So Sun Potion worked with a company that studied the environments where cordyceps grows naturally and created air-tight cylinders that mimic conditions at high altitude and extreme temperatures. According to Linde, the lab-grown stuff is biologically and genetically identical to the best wildcrafted cordyceps. But, though Sun Potion says it’s committed to providing the best-quality products they can, they’re also very protective of their sourcing; Linde declined to name the company they buy from or answer follow-up questions about where it is located. They might be grown on a farm... Organic India, a company that sells USDA-certified organic teas and herbal supplements internationally, began in the 1990s when a group of Americans studying under a spiritual teacher in Lucknow, India noticed that local farmers were struggling to grow genetically modified crops because they had to buy expensive, patented seeds and fertilizers every growing season. The founders began by working with a local farmer to grow organic tulsi that they could market and sell as tea in the U.S.; nearly thirty years later, Organic India has long-since moved into the herbal supplement powder market as well, selling everything from amalaki to whole husk psyllium. In the process, they’ve stayed true to their original producers: All of their products are still grown by family farmers in India, each one working on a small handful of acres. They also occasionally buy wildcrafted herbs from local foragers to supplement their harvest. In the U.S., there are a growing number of small-scale producers like Good Fight Herb Co.’s Lauren Giambrone, who cultivates St. John's wort, hops, horseradish, yarrow, and sage, among other medicinal herbs, on a property in New York’s Hudson Valley. Giambrone partners with local farmers when she’s got a crop that needs more space than her garden has—her ashwagandha, for example, is grown on a neighboring farm. While Giambrone recognizes the value of wildcrafting and does harvest herbs that “volunteer” on her property, there are benefits to having a stable supply available—plus, in a climate like upstate New York, non-native plants like ashwagandha need a little more encouragement to grow and thrive. And they might be processed with stuff you wouldn't expect... Most herbs that come in a capsule, Linde explains, are highly processed. Producers take the raw herb and soak it in hot water, as if they were making tea. The resulting brew is strained, and the leaves or roots used to make it are discarded. Then a drying agent is added to the brew to absorb the liquid and give it body; the resulting mixture is put in capsules and bottled. That drying agent, says Linde, is “often maltodextrin, which is almost entirely produced from GMO corn.” That’s why places like Sun Potion, Organic India, and Good Fight deal mostly with loose powders and teas. Sun Potion’s ashwagandha powder marries tech wizardry with traditional medicine. They contract with a company who steeps the root in very cold water, then subjects it to a series of “high pressure, high vacuum PSI changes,” says Linde. The resulting “tea” is blown through a jet nozzle at high speed, then hit with an “adjacent stream of air" as it comes out of the nozzle, he explains, instantly drying the particles and creating a powder. Giambrone uses a lower-tech method of extraction. She asks for the ashwagandha roots to be delivered to her with field dirt still on them to keep them from drying out. In her apothecary, she sprays them clean and chops them finely with a cleaver. She then makes an extract out of the roots by soaking them in organic sugarcane ethanol, “So the water in the plant pulls out the medicinal constituents that are water-soluble, and the ethanol pulls out the alcohol-soluble constituents in the root.” The solution sits for a month before it’s pressed and packaged for sale. Organic India doesn't do much to their whole herbs, Matt McLaughlin, their marketing director, explains. “We believe that the whole plant provides stability and a better experience for the end user by giving balance to a lot of the different chemical compounds,” he says, which is why their ashwagandha is simply dried, ground up, put in capsules and then bottled and sold. Growing and processing plants for the booming wellness market is a delicate balancing act, but there are plenty of producers who are dedicated to figuring it out. “There’s a camaraderie of people who are really passionate about what they're doing, who care deeply about the quality of the materials that they're purveying,” Linde says of the people he’s found through his work. “At this point there's almost like a secret handshake to say, ‘Hey, I work for the plant.’" See Also:Healthyish Next How a Zombie Worm From Tibet Became an American Health Food Juggernaut By Clarissa WeiRead Next Newsletter THE HEALTHYISH NEWSLETTER IS COMING SOON!

An ad for YouTube's movie 'Thinning' appears Saturday with a video titled 'Hanwa,' which Gipec says is a Serbian word linked to jihadist activity. Credit: Eric Feinberg/YouTube Most Popular Major marketers' ads have likely been showing up on or near YouTube videos promoting terrorism, neo-Nazi groups and other web content for a long time. So why has the brand-safety problem suddenly burst into the open, prompting big advertisers such as General Motors, Walmart, Verizon, AT&T and Johnson & Johnson to stop spending on YouTube or other Google properties? Thank -- or blame -- Eric Feinberg, a longtime marketing-services executive who in recent months has made it his mission to find ad-supported content linked to terror and hate groups, then push links and screen shots proving it happened to journalists in the U.K. and U.S. The resulting coverage has sparked a full-fledged advertiser revolt. Mr. Feinberg owns Southfield, Mich.-based Gipec, short for Global Intellectual Property Enforcement Center, which employs "deep web interrogation" to find keywords and coding linked to terrorism and hate speech. He's also co-owner of a patent issued in December for a "computerized system and method for detecting fraudulent or malicious enterprises." His system works in part by analyzing when videos and websites contain words that appear alongside such phrases as "kill Jews." He's logged thousands of sometimes innocuous or obscure sounding terms he says "co-trend" with such hate speech or exhortations to violence, which in turn helps him finding offensive videos. His efforts with the media have been classic problem-solution marketing. Mr. Feinberg makes no bones about his interest in licensing his technology to Google and other digital platforms to monitor offensive content and keep ads away from it. Certainly Google knows plenty about artificial intelligence and machine learning, as its executives have eagerly informed marketers in public and private presentations for years. And last week, as major advertisers one after the other pressed "pause" on YouTube advertising, Google said in a blog post that it's beefing up its tech efforts and hiring more people to prevent placement of ads with unsavory content. A spokesman declined to comment further. Eric Feinberg, who hopes to sell his system for detecting 'malicious enterprises' online to platforms such as YouTube. Credit: Eric Feinberg But Mr. Feinberg said in an interview on Friday that he doubts Google can succeed. At least, he said, "not without violating my patent." Seemingly there shouldn't be a market for what Mr. Feinberg has to sell. Brand safety, or monitoring ad placements to prevent brands from appearing alongside porn and other embarrassing content, is a standard part of offerings from digital audience measurement firms such as Moat, which in late 2015 became the first such company invited in by YouTube to monitor the site for agencies and brands. Moat CEO Jonah Goodhart declined to comment on Mr. Feinberg's system because he's not familar with it, but conceded that the ad-placement issue "is a topic that seems to be important to folks." "I don't know that an advertiser is able to see the URL where their ad runs by policy of some of the major sites," Mr. Goodhart said in an e-mail. "So one can crawl the web and find bad content, but that's a different thing than stopping an advertiser from appearing on it. Again though, I don't know him or his company so maybe they do something else." Mr. Feinberg wants to sell his tech to the digital platforms themselves, not to brands, agencies or third-party monitors. That's because he's not just out to make money, he said, but to stop terrorists and hate groups from making money off digital advertising, he said. He likened the idea of selling his tech piecemeal to brands and agencies to "fixing your toilet or sink at the house when the problem is at the sewer or the reservoir." So why have Google and seemingly sophisticated ad tech firms failed to find the stuff he keeps finding? "They aren't really understanding key trending or key words, and they're not looking for it like we do," Mr. Feinberg said. "I have a database of thousands of words and phrases linked to nefarious activity." One is a Serbian word roughly transliterated as "hanwa," which has been co-trending with jihadist content online. YouTube Red, YouTube's ad-free subscription service, advertised its movie "The Thinning" on one such "hanwa" video on Saturday, according to a link and screen shot he sent. Related Stories Who Wins and Who Loses in YouTube's Falling Out With Brands Super Bowl Ads Show Up With YouTube Videos Promoting Terror Groups, Sparking Backlash More Big Advertisers Suspend Google Ads Over Offensive Videos J&J and Verizon Join Major Marketers Suspending YouTube Advertising Whether all this will help Mr. Feinberg close a deal with Google or anyone else is hard to say. If he doesn't and Google develops its own solution, he can try to stake a patent claim. Does that make him a patent troll? He argues that he's doing something different than patent litigators that apply an obscure patent to something tech firms were already doing anyway. Mr. Feinberg, by contrast, has gone to great and public lengths in recent weeks to demonstrate that his technology can root out problems Google hasn't found. "I'm doing it for the industry," he said. "I'm an old ad guy." Certainly he's no typical ad-tech guy. He spent nearly two decades running an event marketing, promotion and social-media activation firm focused on sporting events under the name Extreme Advertising & Promotion, based variously in New York and Boca Raton, Fla. Among his efforts were branded tractor-trailer wraps during the Super Bowl in Miami in 1999. He said he's had numerous Fortune 500 clients over the years, including Motorola, General Motors, Sprint and PepsiCo. Work on NFL promotions alerted Mr. Feinberg to the problem of counterfeit licensed merchandise, prompting to him form Fans Against Kounterfeit Enterprise, or FAKE, a company focused on rooting out digital ads from largely Russian and Chinese purveyors of fake but authentic-looking goods. He said he also began five years ago working with musicians to track down pirated videos on YouTube and elsewhere, so they could either have them taken down or get compensated. Two years ago, following the terror attack in France on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper, he began turning his attention to terrorist-linked content online. "I'm sickened by it," Mr. Feinberg said, contrasting ads supporting terrorism and hate groups to what he did in brand promotions. "I'm proud of what I did," he said. "That's why I'm doing this. It's a level of passion."

Police say a man set himself and the car on fire. (Paul Aiken / Staff Photographer) Related Stories Mar 27: Lafayette suicides spotlight increased mental health concerns Man who lit himself on fire outside Lafayette Walmart dies A man set himself and his car on fire in the parking lot of Walmart in Lafayette and was critically injured, according to Lafayette police Cmdr. Brian Rosipajla. He said the man, who appeared to be in his 60s, started driving around the parking lot in a beige Toyota Corolla a little after 5:20 p.m., yelling at people to watch and videotape him. He stopped near a store entrance, doused himself with gasoline inside the car and lit himself and the car on fire, Rosipajla said. He said the man then got out of the car and yelled at bystanders not to extinguish the fire. The bystanders put out the flames covering the man and called police, he said. Police, fire and an ambulance all responded. "There were quite a few people around on a Sunday afternoon," he said. "There were a lot of traumatized people." The man was taken by helicopter to University of Colorado Hospital with second- and third-degree burns, according to police dispatchers. His condition was not known. Tanja Carter, a witness who saw man after he was pulled from the car, said he was burned from head to toe. Earlier this month, another man killed himself in public in Lafayette. The man killed himself with a shotgun on March 15 after approaching officers in the parking lot of Flatirons Community Church and announcing his intentions.

Island Trader Hard times for Sears as retailer notes doubt about future By ANNE D’INNOCENZIO The Associated Press Mar 27, 2017 0 NEW YORK — Sears, a back-to-school shopping destination for generations of kids and the place newlyweds went to choose appliances, has said that after years of losing money that there is “substantial doubt” it will be able to keep its doors open. It’s a dramatic acknowledgment from the chain that owns Sears and Kmart stores, which has long held fast to its stance that a turnaround is possible, even as many of its shoppers have moved on to Wal-Mart, Target or Amazon. There are four Kmarts in the territory and a Sears Kmart appliance center. On St. Croix, one Kmart is at Sunny Isle Shopping Center, the other is at Sunshine Mall and the appliance center is in Estate Diamond Sunny Isle. On St. Thomas, one Kmart is at Tutu Park Mall and the other is in Long Bay. Sears has survived of late mainly with millions in loans funneled through the hedge fund of Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert, but with sales fading it is burning through cash. Sears Holdings Corp. said late Tuesday it lost more than $2 billion last year, and its historical operating results indicated doubt about the future of the company that started in the 1880s as a mail-order catalog business. At a largely empty Sears store in St. Paul, Minn., where the available parking far outstripped the number of cars in the lot, 85-year-old Jack Walsh and his 82-year-old wife, Mary Ann, said they have shopped at Sears their entire lives, buying items from curtains and window treatments to tires and tools. “I bought my tools from Sears and I’ve still got them,” Jack Walsh said. The company known for DieHard batteries and Kenmore appliances has been selling assets, most recently its Craftsman tool brand. But it says pension agreements may prevent the sale of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. “It’s a sad story. This is the place that created the first direct to consumer retail, the first modern department store. It stood like the Colossus over the American retail landscape,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. “But it’s been underinvested and bled dry.” Company shares, which hit an all-time low last month, tumbled more than 13 percent Wednesday. Sears tried to soothe investors’ fears, saying in a post on its site that it remains focused on “executing our transformation plan” and that news reports miss the full disclosure that it’s highlighting actions to reduce risks. It also said that the comments made in the filing were in line with “regulatory standards.” Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, about two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy. He pledged to return Sears to greatness, leveraging its best-known brands and its vast holdings of land, and more recently planned to entice customers with its loyalty program. The company, which employs 140,000 people, announced in January said it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations, and unveiled yet another restructuring plan in February aimed at cutting costs and reconfiguring debts to give itself more breathing room. But it has to get more people through the doors or shopping online for what it’s selling. Sears, like many department stores, has been thwarted by a new consumer that has ripped up the decades-old playbook that the industry has relied upon. A plethora of new online players have also revolutionized the market. Sears has upped its presence online, but is having a hard time disguising its age. Its stores are in need of a major refresh as rivals like Wal-Mart and Target invest heavily to revitalize stores. Sales at established Sears and Kmart locations dropped 10.3 percent in the final quarter of 2016. Industry analysts have placed the staggering sums of money that Sears is losing beside the limited number of assets it has left to sell, and believe the storied retailer may have reached the point of no return. The company has lost $10.4 billion since 2011, the last year that it made a profit. Excluding charges that can be listed as one-time events, the loss is $4.57 billion, says Ken Perkins, who heads the research firm Retail Metrics LLC, but how the losses are stacked no longer seem to matter. “They’re past the tipping point,” Perkins said. “This is a symbolic acknowledgement of the end of Sears of what we know it to be.” For Sears to survive, Perkins believes it would need to do so as a company running maybe 200 stores. It now operates 1,430, a figure that has been vastly reduced in recent years. As for Kmart, Perkins does not see much of a future. For decades, Sears was king of the American shopping landscape. Sears, Roebuck and Co.’s storied catalog featured items from bicycles to sewing machines to houses, and could generate excitement throughout a household when it arrived. The company began opening retail locations in 1925 and expanded swiftly in suburban malls from the 1950s to 1970s. “When I first got married at 19 or 20, we bought our first set of kettles from Sears,” said Darla Klemmensen, who was shopping at the St. Paul store on Wednesday. “We still have some of those.” Klemmensen says Sears has been part of her life since she was a child watching her grandmother order stockings and garters, and she remembers flipping through Sears catalogs as thick as her forearm, full of appliances, clothing and kitchen wares. But the onset of discounters like Wal-Mart created challenges for Sears that have only grown. Sears faced even more competition from online sellers and appliance retailers like Lowe’s and Home Depot. Its stores became its albatross, many of them looking shabby and outdated. The company, based northwest of Chicago in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, lost $607 million in the most recent quarter and revenue fell. “They’ve been delusional about their ability to turn around the business,” said Perkins. Johnson, though, believes one avenue for Sears could be returning to its roots as a direct-to-consumer company, only using the internet versus the old catalog. He believes the Sears name still stands for something for the 40-plus customer. “It has a lot of good memories,” he said. “It stands for being dependable and reliable.” × Post a comment as Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

Cultural differences, government interference and the sheer cost of competing in a market that dwarfs the US have frustrated companies ranging from Wal-Mart Stores to Uber Technologies. Those stumbles aren’t dissuading Airbnb, however. This week the home-sharing pioneer announced that it’s changing its local brand name in China and doubling its investment there. By any measure, the opportunity is immense. In 2015, Chinese travellers spent nearly $500billion (R6.22trillion), and the government expects that number to more than double by 2020 as the country’s middle class expands. But capturing a major piece of that market will require Airbnb to navigate a far more tangled thicket of cultural issues than what confronted Uber and other tech companies in China. And judging by its efforts so far, it probably won’t be up to the task. Share this story Co-founder and CEO of Airbnb Brian Chesky sits on a bed at a bed and breakfast in Langa township, Cape Town In theory, China should be one of the world’s biggest and best markets for home-sharing. Chinese travellers took 2.2billion domestic trips in just the first half of 2016, up nearly 10.5percent year-on-year. Yet China has only 4 hotel rooms for every 1000 people, compared to 20 in the US. And thanks to China’s housing boom, about 50million empty homes are scattered across the country just waiting (in theory) for paying visitors. Biggest barrier But that doesn’t mean Chinese will jump on the opportunity to rent out their properties or stay in someone else’s home. The biggest barrier is establishing trust between owners and renters. In recent years, Chinese consumers have been confronted by scandals ranging from tainted fast food to dodgy pharmaceuticals. They chronically complain of poor-quality goods and misleading marketing or labelling. And they’re highly suspicious of small vendors. So renting a room from a stranger advertising on the internet won’t come naturally. Read also: Airbnb accelerates deal making Homeowners, meanwhile, have their own concerns. Many of China’s vacant properties are purchased as investments, and most affluent homeowners - especially those with desirable vacation rentals - will hesitate to open their doors to poorer tourists, who constitute most Chinese travellers these days and who would be the most likely to forgo a hotel. That reluctance is only heightened by the near-constant stream of news reports about misbehaviour among Chinese travellers at home and abroad. Bridging this gap in trust will be difficult. But there’s some evidence that local companies - which are more familiar with local customs and concerns - are figuring it out. For example, Tujia.com, China’s biggest home-sharing site, takes the ambitious approach of managing each of the 400 000 properties on its site (or hiring a third party to do so). That includes hotel-like services, such as housekeeping, as well as conducting due diligence to confirm that listings are accurate. That doesn’t just improve the experience for renters; it also expands the number of properties available by giving owners - many of whom live far away from their investments - less upkeep to worry about and more peace of mind. 'Experiences' Airbnb, with its paltry 80 000 listings in China, hasn’t made any such effort, focusing instead on self-starting younger travellers. Where Tujia arranges for home cleaners, Airbnb’s new investments are focused on curated “experiences,” such as tours of local landmarks, that can be purchased alongside a room. That kind of thing won’t be enough to overcome the cultural barriers inhibiting home-sharing in China. And so far, there’s little evidence that Airbnb is savvy enough to come up with a more appealing approach.. It’s not all bad news for Airbnb. China’s growing tourism market means that even a niche player focused on adventurous young travellers has a big opportunity. Equally important, outbound travel is growing, and Airbnb’s 3 million global listings will remain the best home-sharing option for Chinese who want one. When it comes to winning China’s local home-sharing market, however, Airbnb should probably check out early. Adam Minter is a Bloomberg View columnist.

Shally Singh grabs milk as she shops with her daughter Leya, 4. Milk prices have fallen over the past year. THE BLADE/KATIE RAUSCH Buy This Image Ken Leftwich of Michigan selects milk from a case at an area store. Local grocers said the exceedingly low prices are probably because of a pricing strategy. ‘I think you have some stores that are lowballing milk,’ said Jim Sautter, owner of Sautter’s Five-Star Markets. THE BLADE/KATIE RAUSCH Buy This Image Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print Some shoppers may not have noticed, but milk prices have been falling steadily the past 18 months, and locally the price of a gallon is less than half the U.S. average cost, possibly stemming from pricing bait by the large grocery chains. In the Toledo area this week, a gallon of milk costs $1.09 at Walmart and Meijer, with Kroger a dime higher at $1.19. A half gallon is priced at 69 cents. Nearly two years ago, a gallon of milk averaged $3.02 nationally but since then it has been dropping steadily, climbing back over $3 just once, in January, 2016. As of last month, the price nationally is $2.58 a gallon, according to the U.S. Department of Labor’s Consumer Price Index. Local grocers said the exceedingly low prices are probably because of a pricing strategy the big three grocery chains are using to compete. “The milk market is stable. It is lower than a year ago, but it’s really not moving one way or another,” said Jim Sautter, owner of Sautter’s Five-Star Markets. “I think you have some stores that are lowballing milk. They’re using it as a loss leader,” he said. Darlene Carmona, manager of Walt Churchill’s Super Markets, said, “Our milk prices are really down, but our competitors are running them at a really cheap price.” A Meijer spokesman said the chain has not noticed lower prices in milk, and a Kroger spokesman could not be reached for comment. Even without the benefit of low-cost pricing strategies, people are paying far less for milk in the past two years. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Marketing Service said there is a surplus in dairy production that has hurt producers and benefited consumers. In 2014, producers were getting $24 per 100 pounds of milk, a record high. Since then, prices dropped to $16.24 at the end of 2016. “That was very close to cost of production,” said Chris Hurt, an agriculture economist at Purdue University. Last year, the price of dairy and related products in the Consumer Price Index were down each month from the year before, on average by 2.3 percent, Mr. Hurt said. Why are shoppers getting such great deals on milk? Mr. Hurt said the answer is in the cost of higher grain feed prices. From 2007-13, grain used for cattle feed escalated in price and resulted in reduced profits in the dairy industry and in higher milk prices. Farmers cut back on their dairy herds, Mr. Hurt said. Since then, grain supplies have increased and feed prices have decreased, enabling farmers to rebuild their herds and increase milk production, thereby driving down the cost of milk, he said. “The commodity side of things, that’s what is driving the grocery store prices,” Mr. Hurt said. “It’s been going down for two years at the retail level.” Consumers should enjoy the low milk prices while they can. Mr. Hurt said some experts think milk prices bottomed out last month. “I think the odds are now that we’re going to head higher on retail prices.” Contact Jon Chavez at: jchavez@theblade.com or 419-724-6128.

Not many young African American women from Hardeeville earn mathematics degrees from Clemson University. But Latishia Webber’s mother insisted she go to Clemson, sight unseen, to prove to others in South Carolina’s educationally deprived “Corridor of Shame” that it can be done. The December graduation ceremony in the foothills was the third for Daraleen Webber. Three of her four girls now have college degrees. It’s been the focus of her life. And it hasn’t been easy. Daraleen Webber raised the girls as a single mom. For 19 years she rode the 5:45 a.m. Palmetto Breeze bus to Hilton Head Island for work, and still uses the bus sometimes. She works two shifts and virtually all holidays at the Hilton Head Diner, waiting tables and hostessing. She’s been there since 1995, and she’s family. She’s also worked at Popeye’s, Wal-Mart, Kroger, McDonald’s — even on a construction job at Arthur Blank’s oceanfront mansion. She lived a number of years in subsidized housing, paying more rent than her neighbors because she worked. Last year, she took her first vacation, a weekend trip to Universal Studios. She can’t drive because she has severe cornea problems. She has no health insurance. She has debt. She says her credit has not always been good. But her children were never in daycare, and they were cheerleaders and played ball and never missed a class trip or church trip. Daraleen Webber worked her life around what she calls “Team Webber.” Also on the team are Gabrielle Allen, the oldest, who graduated cum laude with a degree in physics from Benedict College in Columbia and is now working on a master’s degree in accounting online. She spent six years in the U.S. Army Reserves. “She’s Mommy’s proud soldier,” Daraleen said. Krisinda Webber earned a biology degree from Allen University in Columbia and is a respiratory therapist with an eye on a master’s degree. Patrishia Webber, Latishia’s twin, now wants to enroll at the Technical College of the Lowcountry to study early-childhood education. “Our mother supported us monetarily and emotionally,” Latishia Webber said. “She’s always very encouraging. I can call and ask and she will make it happen.” ‘Ma’am, you are an inspiration’: As third child graduates college, praise pours in for hard-working Hilton Head waitress The new teacher Latishia Webber remembers the day the new math teacher showed up at Hardeeville High School. It was mid-year and they had already had three or four other teachers. No one expected the new one to last. But Michelle Gordon was from the Lowcountry, a graduate of Estill High, with a feel for the challenges her freshmen faced well beyond the postulates and theorems of honors geometry. “She was extremely young,” Latishia Webber remembers. “I wanted to be like her.” Latishia sensed that Gordon actually cared about them, and pushed them hard, saying, “I’m not going to let you fail.” “I told her, ‘You have the thing you need most: a made-up mind,’ ” Gordon said. “She was just determined and focused. I wanted her to see that she had the power to influence others by her example, and she chose to be a good example.” Gordon didn’t want her students to fall into a small-town way of looking at the world, never seeing what is beyond. If they want to come back, great, but they need to see over the horizon, Gordon said. “It truly takes a lot of strength, when challenges come, to stay focused,” Gordon said. Gordon is now the math coordinator for the Beaufort County School District. The two have kept in touch since Latishia graduated as salutatorian of the class of 2011. “I am Godly proud of her,” Gordon said last week. Motivational speaker Daraleen Webber’s girls have always been around positive people. They have an aunt who went to Georgia Tech, an uncle with a big job at a bank, a cousin working on a doctorate. Latishia’s aunt and godmother, Patricia Givens, has a degree from Temple University. Volunteers from Sun City came into their classrooms at an early age. A Sun City family gave the girls their first home computer. Customers at the Hilton Head Diner, which never closes, know them and encourage them. Word of God Christian Center in Hardeeville was a pillar for them. They got scholarships, including one named for Clementa Pinckney, a child of Jasper County whose eulogy was delivered by the president of the United States. Daraleen’s mother was a career aide at a Hardeeville school. Three years ago she saw her house burn to the ground, and then rebuilt by her church. She’s also seen four of her seven grandchildren get four-year degrees and two join the military. But mostly, the girls have their mother, who while taking a mid-afternoon break at the diner sounds like a motivational speaker. “I was never afraid to work,” she said. “I’ve always had a second job. If you work hard, you can go anywhere.” “You do what you have to do,” she said. “There’s no excuse for not doing well these days,” she said. “Parenting is important,” she said. “If they fall behind, find something to help.” “I gave the kids books at Christmas,” she said. “My kids are grown women now, and we are still the closest. We dance. We clown around,” she said. “I told the girls I’m your mom when you need me and your daddy when you need me. I always have their back.” “The diner is a big part of my success. I overhear successful people here talking about their children’s colleges and careers and I wanted that for my kids,” she said. “I wanted my kids to be able to dictate their future. If they want to leave a job, they can do that. They have options. They’ve got a much better chance than I had,” she said. “I’ve sat through three college graduation ceremonies, and it’s a very overwhelming experience,” she said. “I look around at these very rich people and it tells you that even if you have no money, you can still succeed.” David Lauderdale: 843-706-8115, @ThatsLauderdale Related content Single mother of four on what motivates her LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Latest News Suggested for you Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 0:56 Crazy scenes from Five Points: South Carolina basketball advances to Final Four Pause 2:44 8-year-old Rock Hill girl pins wrestling championships 2:14 Gamecocks celebrated at home after NCAA win over Florida 2:28 Getting shot changed Levar Jones's life 0:48 Gamecocks celebrate win over Florida 2:26 Welcome home: South Carolina basketball players address fans 0:41 Carolina Band plays Happy Birthday for Frank Martin in New York 1:04 Single mother of four on what motivates her 0:38 Watch the March 2016 total solar eclipse in 35 seconds 1:23 UNC fans celebrate after Luke Maye's big shot to beat Kentucky Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email an hour ago Student breaks jaw, teeth after put in sleeper hold and thrown to ground in Five Points 0:31 an hour ago Student breaks jaw, teeth after put in sleeper hold and thrown to ground in Five Points 0:59 an hour ago How to kill your lawn without chemicals 2:44 14 hours ago 8-year-old Rock Hill girl pins wrestling championships View more video Latest News Prosecutor Pascoe sets Wednesday bond hearing for Richland’s Sen.

Additional families of the victims of last June’s Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Fla., are expected to sue the tech giant for helping the terrorists who inspired the massacre, The Post has learned. A lawyer for the families said last week’s giant ad boycott of Google and its YouTube operation will help prove his case. YouTube and social-media outfits such as Facebook and Twitter make it too easy for terror groups like ISIS to spread their beliefs and recruit members, lawyer Keith Altman, of Michigan’s Solomon Radner law firm, told The Post. “We are amending the Orlando lawsuit, adding new plaintiffs and adding new allegations and arguments,” he said. Omar Mateen, 29, declared his allegiance to ISIS in a 911 call shortly before he went to nightclub and killed 49 people and wounded 53. Altman first filed suit against Google, Facebook and Twitter in December. Google got into hot water after big advertisers such as Walmart and JPMorgan Chase found the ads they bought on Google placed with alongside videos and sites that spewed anti-America, anti-gay and anti-Semitic hate. Google said it would try to do a better job of screening for hate speech, but more advertisers — including AT&T, Verizon, Starbucks and Johnson & Johnson — have pulled their ads from some Google platforms, including YouTube. Altman believes that the controversy adds fuel to his arguments that Google has a responsibility for what it disseminates. SEE ALSO Google loses more top advertisers amid placement nightmare 0:0 Google saw more big-time advertisers pull their business from its... Citing federal regulations, online ad firms and social networks argue they are not responsible for what crosses their sites, since it is created by others. Altman’s legal argument is that by serving up ads and providing advertisers with audience data, Google is in the content-creation business and thus is not protected by the regulations. “Google is sharing revenue with ISIS. This plays very much into the ad boycott,” the lawyer said. In the suit, Altman claims that for years, Google, Facebook and Twitter “have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds, and attracting new recruits.” “The whole issue will be placed into the complaint,” Altman said.

By Avi Salzman March 27, 2017 5:07 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Recent controversy surrounding YouTube content could push advertisers back toward traditional television. Illustration: Pixabay Major advertisers, including Starbucks, General Motors, and Wal-Mart, have pulled their advertising from YouTube in recent days amid reports that the video service was running their ads next to hateful content. The sudden wave of defections from the Google-owned video company comes at a particularly bad time for Google and its corporate parent Alphabet: the television upfronts are starting, and TV networks are likely to use this controversy to highlight the benefits of advertising alongside professionally produced content. Barron’s Next Why Some Advertisers Are Walking Out on Google Can Investors Still Trust Facebook? Twitter’s Plan for Online Abuse? Ignorance is Bliss Google has made billions running ads against search results and user-generated content, selling advertisers on the premise that Google knows their customers better than anyone. For the most part, advertisers are still on board with Google search ads, although FX Networks, part of 21st Century Fox, went so far as to stop all advertising, including Google search ads. YouTube is a different story. The sheer volume of video content -- 400 hours of video are uploaded per minute -- makes policing the platform particularly difficult, and Google’s automated scanning software has done a mediocre job so far. Content from major brands has been running with videos that mock black and Jewish people, according to a review of content by the Wall Street Journal. Other reviews indicated ads were running along with content supporting terrorists. This has likely been happening for a while, but renewed media attention has made it a more pressing issue. And Google’s response has been too casual for many advertisers. TV stations are likely to emphasize the benefits of advertising with a known entity rather than hoping an algorithm can connect brands with customers. “For television networks defending their positions against a backdrop of continued linear ratings decay, the ‘content quality’ and transparency argument has always been a key talking point,” wrote Wells Fargo analyst Peter Stabler. “With the growing number of major marketers electing to either pause or reallocate YouTube spending, we believe the argument will be presented with renewed vigor.” Instinet analyst Anthony DiClemente expects the controversy to reduce Google’s revenue by about $750 million, a small amount for a company that made $90 billion last year. But he warns that costs could rise as Google comes up with a solution. The company’s response to the controversy could determine if the problem gets bigger, or begins to diminish.

Blair Miller 4:49 PM, Mar 27, 2017 4:49 PM, Mar 27, 2017 denver | colorado | scam | money | xcel Share Article Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next DENVER – A handful of new scams are trying to take advantage of people and their hard-earned money, but there are ways to protect one’s self. Scams come in many forms, and the people behind them are getting better at covering their tracks and finding new ways to fool the people they’re trying to take advantage of. Most recently, the FBI’s Denver office warned that scammers had figured out a way to use a legitimate FBI number to call people to try and rip them off by saying they were under investigation by federal authorities. Another recent scam appears to be sending checks to people that appear to be from Walmart in an attempt to get people to cash them in order to wipe out their bank accounts with the account information. And the Colorado attorney general has prosecuted a handful of construction scam cases in recent months in which contractors promised to do work on a house or business, but took the money and ran instead. Authorities say most scams have a common thread: Scammers will try and demand money in most occasions, and often have figured out some sort of threat to pressure people to pay them. They often require people to go buy pre-paid debit cards to load up with cash and send their way. So if any of those things come up, it’s likely you’re being scammed, and you should hang up your phone or stop communicating with the other person. Most companies and all government agencies say they will never solicit money on a prepaid debit card or money order, and few companies in general ever demand money over the phone. If the person on the other side of the phone line or internet communication sets a deadline for payment and threatens some sort of punishment, it’s also likely a scam. Also, if the scammer asks you to call them back with card or payment information, it’s very likely you’re being scammed. If you have outstanding payments to various companies or agencies and you receive a call you think may be a scam, check with the agency or company you owe money to. While creditors will sometimes call, companies themselves rarely solicit or demand money. Another tip to avoid being scammed: Don’t give out your personal information, debit and credit card numbers, or Social Security number to anything or anyone unless you know it’s a secure website or known caller. The Colorado Attorney General’s Office and Better Business Bureau both take scam reports from citizens to investigate. The BBB says it received 32,781 scam reports across the country in 2016, of which nearly 19 percent involved a person losing money. --------- Sign up for Denver7 email alerts to stay informed about breaking news and daily headlines.

After all, state officials are proceeding cautiously after the Nov. 8 election that made Arkansas the 26th in the nation to approve marijuana for medical use (53%-47%, 585,030-516,525). With legislation continuing, dispensaries will be limited at first to between 20-40, while cultivation centers where the crop is grown will range from four to eight. The Cornell University and Columbia Business School graduate, Southside High School alumni, and partner in CSK Hotels – who earlier this year founded the Arkansas Cannabis Industry Association – hopes to be one of those “four to eight,” but he has also heard the number of applications are “anywhere from 10 to 1,000.” “I expect the truth is probably somewhere in between,” he told Talk Business & Politics with a slight laugh in a Monday (March 27) phone interview. Point being, he expects “a lot of competition” to become one of the state’s first legal growers. One of the hurdles standing in his way was cleared at a March 7 Fort Smith Board of Directors meeting when city directors voted to amend the Unified Development Ordinance (UDO) to allow cultivation facilities in industrial-zoned areas. According to the current verbiage in the law, local zoning regulations for cultivation centers cannot be handled any differently than they would be for a licensed retail pharmacy. That means it is possible for a cultivation facility to operate next door to a Walmart or Walgreen’s pharmacy, something Nolan acknowledged is “not ideal.” “You probably don’t want a cultivation facility to be in commercial zones because a facility the size of ours — if it’s successful — will usually have to operate in a big warehouse,” Nolan explained. JOB GROWTH Along with the help of the UDO adjustment, Nolan has also cleared the hurdle of where the warehouse will be located — in downtown Fort Smith at 100 S. E Street. “Fort Smith is putting a lot of effort into redeveloping downtown, and we think this facility will play into those efforts,” Nolan said, noting that his facility will be home to 30 “good-paying jobs” from line level cultivators and assistants to managers and supervisors. Nolan did not give a hard number on what management/supervisory jobs will pay, but said line level cultivators would start at around $15 per hour and pay for the other positions would “go up from there.” “We want smart, dependable people, and with the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Act, there is the added challenge of passing a background check for anyone, who works in a dispensary or cultivation center. They will have to be fingerprinted and so on.” As far as specific experience, Nolan said the cultivation center would be looking for employees with horticulture experience. “On the processing side, we’re looking for lab experience and commercial retail package food processing — people accustomed to making food products that are highly consistent, someone with factory food grade experience,” he added. This latter experience is useful to cultivation centers because in addition to making medical marijuana concentrate, the facilities also produce edibles ranging from cookies to lozenges. TIMELINE AND ECONOMICS When asked to lay out a timeline for when Fort Smith might see the cultivation center, Nolan said if he and his partners were “lucky enough” to get one of the licenses, approval would come sometime in “late September or October.” “It’s up to the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Commission really,” he noted, adding there would then be a “build-out — making all the rooms as they should be, getting our equipment set up, starting the plants germinating.” Then, the Alcohol Beverage Control (ABC) of Arkansas would inspect the facility, putting a hypothetical open date “in the first quarter of 2018.” “It’s hard to put an exact date on it right now, because this is new to them (ABC) as well, so I think they’re not going to try to rush it,” Nolan said. When figuring out the financial viability of the facility, Nolan said he looked at previous states with legalized medical marijuana and determined the percentage of their populations that had been issued cards. “From there, you multiply that rate by our population, and you might come up with something like between “10,000 and 30,000 people will get one of these cards. Then, you look at what the average patient consumes.” In Nolan’s calculations judging the financial viability of the state’s yet-to-emerge industry, he said consumption could be between 8-14 ounces annually per person. “You do a little math and that works out to 10,000, 20,000 pounds per year when the market becomes stabilized — say, four to five years down the road. It’s not going to be next year.” Comments comments Previous post UA students, rapid growth among causes for rental rise in Northwest Arkansas Next post Retailers eyeing record Easter spending of $18.4 billion Talk Business & Politics by email Arkansas headlines delivered to you on demand Email address Statewide Newsletter Northeast Arkansas Newsletter Fort Smith Newsletter Northwest Arkansas Newsletter Submit Advertisement Search Talk Business & Politics Search for: Opinion Gov.

JOHN, Kan. (KSNW) — For residents in St. John, picking up prescriptions hasn’t been easy. “Right now, we go to Great Bend to Dillons,” said Kayla Killinger Holly Miller said she also goes to Great Bend to get her prescriptions at Walmart. The owners of Medical Arts Pharmacy in Pratt saw the need for a local pharmacy and jumped at the opportunity. “We’re hoping to expand our business here and open up a store in St. John to service the whole Stafford County area,” said Allison Freeze, co-owner of Medical Arts PharmStaffoacy. “Hopefully that will be something that’s going into place late July, is what we’re shooting for.” St. John residents said a local pharmacy will be a huge benefit to the community. They told KSN that ever since Dillons left, they’ve taken their business to other towns. “Honestly I’m very excited to get more stuff here, and I’d most definitely change here, and support our local businesses,” Killinger said. “It’s just something else that we could use in St. John to boost St. John.” A local pharmacy is also great news to the older residents of the town. Right now, they rely on family members or get their prescriptions mailed to them. The executive director of a St. John retirement home, Kenwood Plaza, said she’ll be recommending families to switch to the local pharmacy when it opens. “I really do think most of our family members would switch, as long as the price is comparable,” said Misty Newell. Officials said Stafford County Drug will start in the AG360 Insurance building, along Fourth Street. However, the goal is to move the pharmacy to the new grocery store, once that is up and running. If residents are looking to transfer their prescriptions to the new pharmacy, they can do that now. Freeze said all they need to do is call the Pratt pharmacy at (620) 672-7447, and staff will get their medicine on file.

One part, however, they wouldn’t mind putting off. That’s the provision that limits how much money debit-card companies are allowed to collect from each consumer sale. Generally speaking, banks are against the limit and retailers are in favor. Persuading Congress to change the 2010 banking law is a longshot, but that’s not stopping both industries from spending millions to remind lawmakers, sometimes multiple times a day, that a vote the other way will displease them. Titans such as JPMorgan Chase, who say they use revenue from so-called swipe fees to beef up cybersecurity and offer rewards programs, contend the government shouldn’t set prices. Behemoths like Wal-Mart Stores, who say lower fees translate to lower prices, argue the credit-card industry operates like a monopoly and needs more regulation. The years-long lobbying fight has been reinvigorated by President Donald Trump’s call to rip up financial rules. Stuck in the middle are lawmakers from both parties who prefer cordial relations, and campaign contributions, from both sides. “This is like choosing between children,’’ said Issac Boltansky, a financial regulation analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading. “It’s brutal for everyone involved.’’ Swipe fees, also known as interchange fees, are set by Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc., but most of the money goes to banks. A provision of the Dodd-Frank law added by Illinois Democratic Sen. Richard Durbin capped fees for debit cards at about 24 cents per transaction while leaving credit cards alone. Before the Durbin amendment, the average swipe fee for debits was about 44 cents. That means the measure has cost the banking industry $9 billion in revenue, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. Other rules in Dodd-Frank, such as the Volcker Rule restricting bank trading and the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, get more attention. The Durbin amendment, however, is probably disliked most by banks. Many Republicans and Democrats agree on one thing about swipe-fee limits: they’re a pain in the neck. “This issue always makes me grumpy,” said Rep. Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat and former Goldman Sachs banker. “I’m being forced to choose between the competing interests of two big industries.” “We’re listening to everyone,’’ said Scott Tipton, a Colorado Republican. “This is an ongoing issue.” “We haven’t taken a position on this yet,” said Rep. Claudia Tenney, a Republican from New York. “If you contact our office, we’ll talk to you about that at another time when I’m prepared to talk about that,’’ said Texas Democrat Al Green. A major annoyance for elected officials: the 4.7 million stores and restaurants across the country that accept debit cards and the 5,000 commercial banks that issue them. The vast numbers increase the odds that in each of the country’s 435 congressional districts, regardless of the outcome of the vote, someone will be pitching a fit. Making changes to Dodd-Frank won’t be quick or easy, especially with Congress distracted by tax reform and infrastructure. The battle has been going on for years in court, too, with retailers squaring off against Visa and MasterCard over interchange fees. The U.S. Supreme Court Monday refused to allow a $5.7 billion settlement between the parties in a case that now promises years of additional litigation. On Capitol Hill, the courts and in business negotiations, the stake from both debit and credit-card fees is roughly $50 billion. To ply an advantage in Washington, retailers have spent nearly $359 million on lobbying since 2010, according to OpenSecrets.org. During that time, banks and payment companies have spent about $248 million. Those totals include advocacy on other issues besides debit cards. “This isn’t just about a bill, it’s about billable hours,’’ said Charles Gabriel, a financial regulation expert at Capital Alpha Partners in Washington. “It’s crunch time for all the lobbyists on both sides who’ve been fighting this for years.’’ Lobbyists have called on the so-called little guys to make their cases on Capitol Hill. Financial firms are relying on community bankers and credit union executives like Randall Dixon, chief executive officer of Energy Capital in Houston, to make their case. Before one recent Washington visit, lobbyists coached them on what to say about debit cards. “Lawmakers in Texas need to understand that there should be a level playing field,” said Dixon, who was among hundreds of credit union executives introduced to members of Congress this month by the Credit Union National Association. “They need to hear from people like me.” Retail groups, including those whose members include Home Depot Inc. and Target Corp., have recruited hundreds of restaurant owners, convenience-store managers and other small-business owners around the country to make the opposite case. “This is a top priority,” said Doug Kantor, a partner at the law firm Steptoe Johnson who works on behalf of groups including the National Association of Convenience Stores. “We’re doing all of the things that you do when you want to lobby an issue hard.” Retailers and their allies in Congress claim a small victory, perhaps short-lived, because Republicans have yet to introduce their latest updating of Dodd-Frank, dubbed the Financial Choice Act. “Durbin is an important part of this bill. As a matter of principle, Republicans do not believe in federal price controls,” Jeb Hensarling, the Texan who’s chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement. “Members are continuing to listen to both sides on this issue. We’ll see how that plays out.” Debit-card fees were one of the criteria for Republicans to join the Financial Services committee this term. An assignment on the panel is a plum gig, especially for freshman lawmakers who can use it as access to Wall Street’s deep pockets. Hensarling asked every candidate in a sit-down interview whether they supported the Financial Choice Act and, specifically, a repeal of the Durbin amendment. “The delay of Hensarling’s plan is evidence of the resistance,” said Rep. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat. “There’s a lot of pushback from members who would prefer not to have to take that vote.” Even the data has pitted one side against the other. A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, often cited by bank lobbyists, found that most merchants raised prices or did nothing as a result of the Durbin Amendment. But retailers frequently refer to their own research, that consumers saved nearly $6 billion just in 2012 because of the Durbin provision. “It’s consumers that are caught in the crosshairs,” said Glen Sarvady, an independent consultant who works with credit unions. “This is really just a broader battle about who has the stronger hand to play between the two industries.” Filed under: Bank, Card, JP Morgan, Retail, Wal-Mart Print Email Gmail Related JPMorgan’s Dimon: Target Breach Is a Wake-Up Call Supreme Court Won’t Hear Dispute Over Debit-Card Fees Banks, Retailers Take Swipes at Each Other Over Dodd-Frank Fees House Approves Volcker-Rule Delay Despite Obama Veto Threat US Appeals Court Upholds Fed’s Cap on ‘Swipe’ Fees More in Business Hertz Shares Bear Brunt of Reaction to Used-Car Price Drop Uber Suspends Self-Driving Car Program in 2 States Stocks Dip as ‘Trump Trade’ Heads in Reverse Supreme Court Won’t Restore $7.25B Swipe-Fees Settlement European Regulators Clear Dow Chemical-DuPont Merger OP-ED Time for Kurdish Independence?

Fred Naclerio, owner of Apollo group of businesses in Blenheim, Ont., is pictured with three women who have been an integral part of his success, including from left, Melissa Bushey, a long time employee, his wife Michele Naclerio, and his sister Margaret Foster. Photo taken on Monday March 27, 2017. (Ellwood Shreve/Chatham Daily News/Postmedia Network) Tweet Change text size for the story Print Report an error BLENHEIM  -  Fred Naclerio's plan for success is pretty straightforward. “Just dedication, long hours and never give up,” said the owner of Apollo Property Management, and several other companies that have helped the Blenheim resident earn recognition as 2017 Entrepreneur of the Year from the Chatham-Kent Chamber of Commerce. The family-run business began in 2001 out of Naclerio's home, using the garage as a tool shop and converting a basement toy room into an office for his sister Margaret Foster, who continues to be an integral part of the business as an account manager. Today, Apollo Property Management has grown to include nearly 160 commercial tenants with the majority of property purchased and developed in Chatham-Kent, along with some acquisitions in London and Windsor. Apollo General Contracting includes clients such as Walmart, Metro and Sobeys grocery stores, and TJX, which operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls retail outlets, across Ontario from Thunder Bay to Ottawa and around the Greater Toronto Area. Naclerio also manages Realty Connects Inc., real estate company as well Willow Ridge Golf Course in Blenheim. Naclerio's wife Michele runs two other company divisions – Apollo Express, a trucking company, and Apollo Store Fixture, a custom millwork and fabrications business. Looking back on how far the business has come, Naclerio knows it couldn't have happened without the support of family and their team of employees. “I give a lot of credit to my wife and our two daughters,” he said, adding the 120-hour work weeks required during the first five years “meant a lot of family life was sacrificed, but they stuck by me.” The business still keeps him quite busy, he said, but added his work week has been scaled back to 70-75 hours. When asked about receiving this recognition, Naclerio said this isn't just about him, it has been a total team effort. “I couldn't do without them, I wouldn't have got this far without them,” he said of the nearly 80 employees who work at his various companies. Naclerio also credits the example set by his parents Onofrio and Maria, who immigrated to Canada from Naples, Italy, as he recalled joining them in his younger years to work in local agricultural fields. “They instilled the hard work ethic, definitely, and the never give up attitude,” he said. When asked what drives him to succeed in business, Naclerio said, “just to see how far I can succeed, it's not really about the money.” With many clients in the GTA, Naclerio admits it probably would have made more sense, geographically, to locate his business closer to Toronto, especially with all the commuting that was required, along with spending many nights in motel rooms. “Growing in this business, I was always the guy that was way off in left field,” he said, adding business associates often asked: 'Why are you in Timbuktu?” The reason Naclerio stays is his connection to his hometown. “I was born and raised here, I got in trouble on these streets,” he laughed. “There is where I want to be, this is where I'm happy.” Naclerio will receive his award during the chamber's 129th annual Business Excellence Awards being held on Thursday at Club Lentina in Chatham.   eshreve@postmedia.com @DailyNewsES   Featured Businesses Contact us to Advertise » Finance Credit Bureau Collection Services​ 55+ & Seniors St Andrew's Residence Seniors Day Out Services Party Planners Go to the Marketplace » Local Businesses Advertise with us Contribute Send Your Scoop!

(WPVI) WPVI By Alicia Vitarelli Monday, March 27, 2017 05:23PM PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- Spring cleaning is a great time to streamline, but it's even better if you can make space and make cash. First, if you have stacks of DVDs clogging up drawers and cabinets and entertainment centers, listen closely. You may have heard of Vudu, a service from Walmart where you pay a fee to have physical DVDs and Blu-rays converted to digital files. They just launched it in app form, so all you do is scan the barcode and the title appears in your digital library. The Vudu app is free, but it does cost anywhere from $2 to $5 a disc. But then, you can make some of that money back. Websites like secondspin.com and decluttr.com will buy the physical discs, including CDs, so you get some of that money back. When it comes to selling stuff you're not using, there are two places you probably check into daily where there's an audience for your things. First, Amazon's "marketplace." This allows you to sell your items alongside businesses. You can sell things new or used depending on the item and category. They do charge you 99 cents for every item you sell. Then there's the completely free Facebook Marketplace. It can be found through the little shop icon. Based on where you live, the social network now shows you who is selling what. You post what you're selling...and once you get a sale, you work out the exchange with your buyer. It's also a great way to shop for deals. ------ Send a breaking news alert to Action News Report a correction or typo Learn more about the 6abc family of apps Related Topics: shoppingconsumersaving with 6abcwhat's the dealspringsave money Email share share tweet email (Copyright ©2017 WPVI-TV.

George W. Eissler, 38, of Mohawk in Herkimer County, was charged with petit larceny, a misdemeanor. Employees at the Walmart Supercenter at 5815 Rome Taberg Road in the city of Rome called police at 1:19 a.m. to report the theft, state police said in a news release. Walmart employees told troopers a man ran out of the store with a shopping cart filled with items, including two flat screen televisions, state police said in the news release. Troopers reviewed security footage, which showed the suspect had run toward the nearby Monro Muffler. As state police checked the area, they found the suspect in a fenced-in area next to Monro Muffler and hiding in a cardboard box. Eissler was released on an appearance ticket. He is scheduled to answer the charge April 4 in Rome City Court.

Being a young mom with a hit reality show means that all of your parenting highs and lows and broadcasted for the world to see, and some fans aren’t shy about expressing their negative feelings toward Kailyn Lowry via social media. But the pregnant mother of three decided to take to Twitter to clap back at a rude fan instead of taking it. Lowry responded “Oh good one” with a smiling crying emoji after a viewer of the Teen Mom 2 franchise let the reality star and author know she thought she looked homeless. When a fan of Kailyn Lowry’s tweeted that she wanted to go to Wal-Mart with the star, she laughed off the previous mean comment by telling her true fan that she probably looked too homeless to go out with. The exchange took place on Kailyn’s official Twitter account. Oh good one ???????????? https://t.co/zo3vaIZtTf — Kail Lowry (@KailLowry) March 27, 2017 Omg no. I look homeless https://t.co/By1c5GIwbM — Kail Lowry (@KailLowry) March 26, 2017 Evidently, being a famous teen mom sometimes means having to deal with fans who aren’t exactly happy with all of your decisions. But at least Kailyn Lowry can laugh off some of the comments and not take them to heart. Still, being accessible to fans 24/7 via social media must be exhausting for any modern star as negativity is sent directly to their accounts without a filter. Kailyn Lowry and Javi Marroquin sign autographs at a 2015 fashion show in NYC. [Image by JMA/STAR MAX/IPx/AP Images] While some might ignore a rude comment, it’s good that Kailyn is sticking up for herself and showing a sense of humor about the whole thing. Recently, Kailyn Lowry had a few haters show up at a signing for her new book, Hustle and Heart. Two women appeared to have their photo taken with Kailyn wearing T-shirts they had made that read “Team Javi Puta,” referring to Kailyn’s ex-husband Javi Marroquin. The shirts even included a still from an episode of Teen Mom 2 in which Javi and Kailyn got into a fight when discussing their 3-year-old son, Lincoln. The in-person haters tweeted their photo to Javi, who initially laughed at the shirts. However, he then added that it wasn’t cool of them to come to her book signing just to harass her. He weighed in on Twitter. “At the end of the day that isn’t cool. That’s my sons mother. We’ve put everything behind us to raise our son the right way,” he said. Kailyn Lowry has been getting her fair share of attention lately due to her pregnancy with a mystery man’s baby. Amid a tumultuous divorce from husband Javi Marroquin, which was partially documented on Teen Mom 2, Kailyn Lowry announced she was pregnant with her third child and that her ex was not the father. There is some speculation that Kailyn Lowry actually got pregnant while she was still married to Javi, which has made many fans lose respect for her in their eyes. Kailyn Lowry and ex-boyfriend (and father of her first child, Isaac) attend the 2016 MTV Movie Awards [Image by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images] Speculation continues that both parties may have cheated on one another during the tail end of their marriage. Since then, Kailyn has been keeping mum about the paternity of her new little bundle of joy with fans hanging on to every nugget that might reveal a clue as to who the baby daddy might be. Rumors are swirling that Kailyn Lowry will reveal his identity in a new third book, for which she’s already inked a deal. Kailyn Lowry and Javi have both moved on from their failed marriage. Javi Marroquin is now dating Real World alum Madison Walls. While Kailyn has revealed that she isn’t in a relationship with her third child’s father, there is speculation that she is in a relationship with a woman, her longtime friend Becky Hayter. The rumor sparked thanks to a few photos that have appeared on Twitter where the two appear quite cozy.

(FSIS.gov) Print Email Ann Maloney, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune By Ann Maloney, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune The Times-Picayune Follow on Twitter on March 27, 2017 at 3:32 PM, updated March 27, 2017 at 4:39 PM comments Tons of breaded chicken fries, nuggets and fillets, sold at retail stores and at institutions nationwide, were recalled by OK Food Inc. of Oklahoma City on Thursday (March 23), after metal pieces were found in some of the food, U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service announced. The business recalled approximately 933,272 pounds -- or 466 tons -- of ready-to-eat breaded chicken foods that "may be contaminated with extraneous materials, specifically metal," the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service stated Thursday. Find a list of recalled products and see their labels at fsis.usda.gov/recalls. The breaded chicken -- sold under a variety of labels and in various retail stores, including the Great Value brand at WalMart -- was made between Dec. 19, 2016 through March 7, 2017. The recalled products feature the number "P-7092" inside the USDA mark of inspection. "The problem was discovered on March 21, 2017 after OK Foods Inc. received five consumer complaints stating that metal objects were found in the ready-to-eat chicken products and by FSIS inspection personnel during verification activities," according to an FSIS press release. "After an internal investigation, the firm identified the affected product and determined that the objects in all the complaints came from metal conveyor belting." So far, no injuries or "reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products" have been reported, according to the release. Consumers who have bought these products should throw them away or return them to the store where they purchased them. Consumers with questions about the recall can contact Abby Brown at 479.312.2409. Consumers with food safety questions can "Ask Karen," the FSIS virtual representative available at AskKaren.gov or via smartphone at m.askkaren.gov.  The toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline is 888.674.6854) is available in English and Spanish, Monday through Friday, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The Electronic Consumer Complaint Monitoring System can be accessed at  fsis.usda.gov/reportproblem.

Act this week and snag AMD’s Ryzen 7 for its lowest price to date. The recently Walmart acquired Jet.com just put the Ryzen 7 1700 and 1700X on its site where they qualify for $30 off coupon code: TRIPLE15. The code can be used on your first three purchases at Jet but expires soon on April 1. That gives you essentially now through Saturday to pick up the Ryzen 7s at historic low prices of $299 for the 1700 and $367 for the 1700X. Been in the market for a quality gaming mouse but don’t feel like throwing down the $90 required for a high end unit? Well, this week Best Buy has the Corsair Scimitar MMO Mouse slashed from $80 to $39.99. This half price discount makes its lowest price to date by $8 and $40 off the MSRP.

On March 3, an unidentified man entered the Walmart on Grandview Blvd in Madison.  Just after midnight, the man, wearing what appears to be a light colored jogging suit with a Dallas Cowboys Logo on the front left pocket of the pants, could be seen removing various electronic devices from the store and taking the items out to the open area of the garden center. The man first entered the store after he walked over from the Applebee’s and Lowe’s area across the street. It was eventually determined by video that the subject had placed what appears to be a large dark colored duffle bag outside the garden center where he eventually gathered up all of the merchandise he had removed and placed all of it into the large bag. The man was last seen on video walking back towards the Applebee's and Lowe’s area where he disappeared from view on the camera. The man was determined to have stolen the items from the store between 12:40 a.m. and 1:30 a.m. The man managed to take a total of $14,215 in merchandise consisting of Nest Smart Thermostats, Nest Indoor and Outdoor Security camera systems, Canary Security Camera Systems, Netgear Wi-Fi equipment, Google Home Systems, doorbells with built in security cameras and smart smoke detectors. Anyone with information that leads to the positive location and arrest of this individual would be eligible for a reward of up to $2500.  If you have information to help in this case, please call Crime Stoppers at 601-355-TIPS (8477) or submit a tip online here.

Ree Drummond, the Food Network's "Pioneer Woman," knows a thing or two about writing. After all, it was due to her enormous success in the blogging world that she landed her own television show on Food Network, a kitchenware collection at Walmart, and her very own magazine. Not to mention her general-store-slash restaurant, four cookbooks, and a series of children's books about the life of her dog. Related Ree Drummond's Oklahoma Restaurant Gets 6,000 Visitors Per Day—in a Town of Only 3,500 Southern Baked Chicken Casserole Best Southern Food in the U.S. Now, Drummond's getting back to her writer roots with a new children's book series. This one, which features a very familiar-looking redhead, is all about the transition from life in the city to life in the country, and it's aptly titled "Little Ree."  The Ree we meet in the book goes on her fair share of farm adventures, getting to know her new surroundings, meeting farm animals, and even learning to dress the part. https://www.facebook.com/thepioneerwoman/posts/10154657765737858 My new children's book "Little Ree" will be out next Tuesday! Here's a little sneak peek, along with a small handful of tour stops. It was so fun writing this book.Posted by The Pioneer Woman - Ree Drummond on Friday, March 24, 2017   "Little Ree trades in her city days for a country way of life when she moves with her family to her grandparents’ ranch," the book's description reads. "She’s excited to ride horses, swim in the pond, and help Grandma cook for everyone. But on her first day, she finds that living on a ranch can be tough...Luckily, the end of the day brings a big family barbecue...and the happy discovery that being a country girl isn’t about the right pair of boots, it’s all about the right attitude." Plus, there's a "special pancake recipe" at the end of the book — which means even parents have something to look forward to here.   Drummond will be making stops in North Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee this week, with more states to be added to her tour next month. But we're not sure if she even needs to travel so much. The book's already a bestseller on Amazon, and it hasn't even been released yet. Grab your own copy here!

April L. Roysdon, 36, of the Ditney Trail neighborhood in Pioneer, was arrested Thursday evening by Oneida Police Department patrolman David Lee Stephens, and charged with theft and contributing to the delinquency of a child. Allegedly, Roysdon used her young son to not only push the cart that stolen items were placed into, but had him place the items into a shopping bag in order to conceal them.

Mmm, tastes like "extraneous materials." Yup, there's been another recall. And we're particularly wary of this one, because it affects something nearly all of us buy on a regular basis: chicken. Related Here's Some Good News for People With Nut Allergies 21,000 Pounds of Frozen Pizza Recalled From Select Walmart Stores Trader Joe's Just Recalled Breakfast Burritos Because There Might Be Plastic In Them On Friday, OK Foods issued a recall of nearly one million pounds of breaded chicken that were potentially contaminated with "extraneous materials." The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Services states that the affected items are ready-to-eat chicken products produced between December 19, 2016 and March 7, 2017, and they're sold at many retailers nationwide, including some Walmart stores. As for those "extraneous materials"? OK Foods "received five consumer complaints stating that metal objects were found in the ready-to-eat chicken products and by FSIS inspection personnel during verification activities. After an internal investigation, the firm identified the affected product and determined that the objects in all the complaints came from metal conveyor belting." Metal. Objects. Excuse us while we NEVER EAT CHICKEN AGAIN. No, no, we're only joking. After all, with scares like these happening on a near-weekly basis, you should really just keep your wits about you and continue eating the foods you're used to eating. When it comes to this specific product, though, it's best to play it safe, referring to this list and tossing what you have. If you're unsure whether you're affected by the recall, you can also use the USDA's "Ask Karen" tool, available 24 hours a day at AskKaren.gov.

The trek continues into the fall, wrapping up Oct. 1 in Dallas. Cities on the routing include Las Vegas, Oklahoma City, Nashville, Toronto, Cincinnati, and Inglewood, Calif. “No matter what I will ever do, nothing feels like home as much as playing these songs with these guys and it never will,” Matchbox Twenty frontman Thomas said. “And I can’t wait to spend another summer out there on the road with the Crows.”    Counting Crows is looking forward to the road trip too. “To be honest, we took a vote after last year and decided to spend every summer with Rob from now on,” Counting Crows’ Adam Duritz adds. “Can. Not. Wait.”   Counting Crows Chastain Park Amphitheatre, Atlanta, Ga. July 25, 2016 (Chris McKay / GettyImages.com) | - In October Matchbox Twenty celebrated the 20th anniversary of the release of its debut album, Yourself Or Someone Like You. The LP has been certified 12x platinum, selling more than 15 million copies worldwide. Chances are good that the band will play some of the LP’s classic singles on tour this year, like “Push” and “3 AM.” The band’s most recent album is 2012’s North. Counting Crows released its seventh studio album, Somewhere Under Wonderland, in 2014. A review from Rolling Stone says, “Adam Duritz is still the same dreadlocked dreamer you remember from the Nineties, channeling Van Morrison, R.E.M. and Bruce Springsteen into word-zonked ballads that reference Jackie O., Elvis, Johnny Appleseed and more.” Check out the schedule for the tour below: July 12 – Spokane, Wash., Spokane Arena July 14 – Edmonton, Alberta, Rogers Place July 16 – Vancouver, British Columbia, Rogers Arena July 18 – Auburn, Wash., White River Amphitheatre July 19 – Ridgefield, Wash., Sunlight Supply Amphitheater July 21 – Mountain View, Calif., Shoreline Amphitheatre July 22 – Paso Robles, Calif., California Mid-State Fair Grandstand (California Mid-State Fair) July 24 – Murphys, Calif., Ironstone Amphitheatre July 26 – Reno, Nev., Grand Sierra Resort Theatre July 28 – Chula Vista, Calif., Mattress Firm Amphitheatre July 29 – Las Vegas, Nev., Mandalay Bay Events Center July 31 – Inglewood, Calif., Forum Aug. 2 – Phoenix, Ariz., Ak-Chin Pavilion Aug. 4 – Albuquerque, N.M., Isleta Amphitheater Aug. 6 – Oklahoma City, Okla., Oklahoma City Zoo Amphitheatre Aug. 7 – Rogers, Ark., Walmart AMP Aug. 9 – Pelham, Ala., Oak Mountain Amphitheatre Aug. 12 – Nashville, Tenn., Bridgestone Arena Aug. 13 – Atlanta, Ga., Lakewood Amphitheatre Aug. 15 – Tampa, Fla., MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre Aug. 16 – West Palm Beach, Fla., Perfect Vodka Amphitheatre Aug. 19 – Jacksonville, Fla., Daily's Place Aug. 20 – Charlotte, N.C., PN.C.

The news comes as police release images of the suspect they obtained from security cameras after the latest incident, Isabella County Sheriff Mike Main said. That incident occurred at about 7:30 p.m. Friday, March 24, in the parking lot of the Walmart Supercenter on 4730 Encore Drive in Union Township, Main said. The day before, a woman reported she returned to her car in the parking lot of a Union Township Target to find a pornographic DVD and note on her windshield. The note said, "Hi Just a couple of your friends being silly," and featured a hand drawn picture of two round faces with curly hair, smiles and empty eye circles, according to the woman's Facebook post. After the news of the Target incident was announced, Main said more victims have come forward and investigators found 10 more incidents within Isabella County and two outside of the county. "The victims all have had similar experiences with pornographic material being left on their vehicle while they were inside a retail store," Main said. "Most have had the same drawing and verbiage left with the pornographic material." The suspect's vehicle is described as a Silver Chevy Traverse, a type of SUV.    Countdown to Tigers' opener April 3 Over/under on Tigers wins well behind Indians Ausmus: Norris must work through mental hurdle of 'dead arm' Castellanos batting second or fifth: Which benefits Tigers more?

The investigation began in early March after a woman lost her credit card in Eastwood, according to police. The woman told police she lost it sometime in the morning on March 11 along James Street. After realizing it was gone, the woman called her credit card company, police said. They told her the card had last been used in a Camillus Wal-Mart. The woman told authorities she had not bought anything at that Wal-Mart and hadn't given anyone permission to use her card. Investigators were able to obtain surveillance footage of the people suspected of illegally using the woman's card. Police circulated their photos Monday, asking the public to speak up if they were recognizable. Police ask anyone with information to call (215) 442-5222 or submit a tip using the "SPD Tips" app. Crime in Central NY Police Blotter Search for arrests by Syracuse and Central New York law enforcement agencies and New York State Police.

Thanks to the support of donors and corporate partners, the money raised will help The Salvation Army provide food, shelter and social services to more than 25 million Americans in need this year. Experience the interactive Multimedia News Release here: http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7958031-salvation-army-redkettlereason/ "Despite fluctuating retail traffic across the country that affected the number of people getting out and donating into the kettles, the Red Kettle Campaign collected an impressive $147.3 million total," said Lt. Col. Ron Busroe, community relations and development secretary for The Salvation Army's National Headquarters. "We were encouraged to see that despite these circumstances, Americans generously supported the work we do and helped us raise the campaign's fourth highest donation total in its 126-year history." The Salvation Army enjoyed a jam-packed holiday season with initiatives new and old. Starting from the top: The Salvation Army continued its #RedKettleReason initiative, a movement fueled by America's motivations for donating to the red kettles. New this season, The Salvation Army called on Americans to start their own #RedKettleReason fundraisers, and offered the opportunity to designate their contributions to support cause areas that fight hunger, provide shelter or ensure Christmas assistance for those in need. Actor, producer and musician Nick Cannon led the charge in his second year as #RedKettleReason Ambassador, and he asked his fans to help him make Christmas bright for children and families in need. Trick-shot artist Brodie Smith called attention to hunger relief with a series of amazing kettle trick shots, including one at AT&T Stadium, the home of 20-year Salvation Army partner, the Dallas Cowboys. The first family of viral video, The Holderness Family, best known for their hit musical parody "Xmas Jammies," raised money for The Salvation Army's Christmas assistance programs with a remake of  "Up on the Rooftop" to encourage support. Beauty and lifestyle vlogger Dulce Candy called attention to the need for a safe place for children to go as she chronicled her afternoon volunteering at The Salvation Army's Los Angeles Daycare Center. Jerry Jones and Charlotte Jones Anderson, along with The Salvation Army's National Commander, Commissioner David Jeffrey, kicked off the 2016 Red Kettle Campaign and celebrated 20 years of partnership with a satellite media tour at AT&T Stadium the day before Thanksgiving. The Dallas Cowboys also showcased the partnership and #RedKettleReason on national television just before a LIVE performance from country music star Eric Church during halftime of the Thanksgiving Day game. The campaign kickoff marked the 20th year the Cowboys organization has partnered with The Salvation Army to launch the iconic campaign during the nationally televised game. Since partnering with the team, the Red Kettle Campaign has raised nearly $2.2 billion. The Dallas Cowboys also conducted a point-of-sale campaign through the Dallas Cowboys Pro Shops, both in-store and online, giving customers the option to add a donation to The Salvation Army to their purchase. A surprise uptick in awareness and donations was also spurred by Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott's "Red Kettle Leap," which quickly became a trending topic on social media, during the Dallas Cowboys game on Sunday, December 18. Elliott called on fans to donate to the Red Kettle Campaign in $21 increments, a nod to his jersey number. Those donations, including a $21,000 contribution from Ezekiel Elliott and a generous donation match of $21,000 from a Texas couple, totaled nearly $250,000. Leading up to and on #GivingTuesday, November 29, The Salvation Army was seen and talked about during national media appearances on the TODAY show with Nick Cannon, Access Hollywood Live and Steve Harvey. The week of Christmas, TODAY aired a segment featuring a family helped by The Salvation Army's Christmas assistance program in Phoenix, AZ. Corporate partners also contributed greatly to the success of the 2016 Red Kettle Campaign. Red Kettles outside of 5,093 Walmart and Sam's Club locations across the U.S. collected $44.25 million, which contributed about 30 percent of the $147.3 million total. More than 2,400 locations of Kroger's family of stores hosted red kettles, raising a total of $16.9 million, or 11 percent of the $147.3 million total. Red Kettles at roughly 700 JCPenney stores collected a total of nearly $2.7 million for the campaign, 500 Big Lots locations raised $888,900 and 79 Bass Pro Shops locations raised nearly $400,000. From November 25 through December 11, 715 Walmart stores hosted the fifth annual Fill the Truck event, collecting more than 80,000 coats and 4,000 toys for children during the holidays. Hanes and The Salvation Army teamed up once again to provide socks to those in need. As part of their annual sock drive, Hanes donated 200,000 pairs of socks to The Salvation Army, bringing the total number of socks donated over the past eight years to more than 1.8 million pairs. Between November 1 and December 31, Dr Pepper Snapple Group donated a portion of sales to The Salvation Army for every specially marked 7UP, CANADA DRY and SQUIRT 2-liter bottle, 20-ounce bottle and 12-pack sold. Krispy Kreme hosted counter kettles at participating locations nationwide, raising over $27,000 for the Red Kettle Campaign. Krispy Kreme also donated a percentage of sales from Monday December 19, to The Salvation Army. UPS ran its Wishes Delivered campaign with The Salvation Army included in its select group of charity partners to each receive $33,333. For every wish submitted with the campaign's hashtag, UPS donated $1 and shared stories of the people and organizations who are solving problems to make a difference in communities. Cricket Wireless donated $1 per "like" on a participating local Cricket Wireless store Facebook page, raising nearly $41,000 for The Salvation Army to purchase toys for children in need offering something to smile about during the holidays. During the holidays, 3.3 million people rely on The Salvation Army to provide their families with a warm meal or toys for children on Christmas Day. In addition to the help provided during the holiday season, donations made to the red kettles help the Army provide more than 10 million nights of shelter, nearly 57 million meals and programming such as substance abuse recovery, after-school programs and emergency shelter for children and families in need year-round. In all, The Salvation Army is able to help more than 25 million people each year, thanks in large part to people's generous donations. From its humble beginnings as a program started by a Salvation Army captain in San Francisco in 1891, the Red Kettle Campaign has grown into one of the most recognizable and important charitable campaigns in the United States. It provides toys for kids, coats for the homeless, food for the hungry and countless social service programs year-round. More than 25,000 Salvation Army volunteers throughout the country ring bells and solicit donations to the red kettles. About The Salvation Army The Salvation Army, established in London in 1865, has been supporting those in need without discrimination for more than 135 years in the U.S. More than 25 million Americans receive assistance from The Salvation Army each year through a range of social services: food for the hungry, relief for disaster victims, assistance for the disabled, outreach to the elderly and ill, clothing and shelter to the homeless and opportunities for underprivileged children. For every dollar donated to The Salvation Army, 82 cents is used to support those services in 5,000 communities nationwide. The Salvation Army tracks the level of need across the country with the Human Needs Index (HumanNeedsIndex.org).

Experience the interactive Multimedia News Release here: http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7958031-salvation-army-redkettlereason/ "Despite fluctuating retail traffic across the country that affected the number of people getting out and donating into the kettles, the Red Kettle Campaign collected an impressive $147.3 million total," said Lt. Col. Ron Busroe, community relations and development secretary for The Salvation Army's National Headquarters. "We were encouraged to see that despite these circumstances, Americans generously supported the work we do and helped us raise the campaign's fourth highest donation total in its 126-year history." The Salvation Army enjoyed a jam-packed holiday season with initiatives new and old. Starting from the top: The Salvation Army continued its #RedKettleReason initiative, a movement fueled by America's motivations for donating to the red kettles. New this season, The Salvation Army called on Americans to start their own #RedKettleReason fundraisers, and offered the opportunity to designate their contributions to support cause areas that fight hunger, provide shelter or ensure Christmas assistance for those in need. Actor, producer and musician Nick Cannon led the charge in his second year as #RedKettleReason Ambassador, and he asked his fans to help him make Christmas bright for children and families in need. Trick-shot artist Brodie Smith called attention to hunger relief with a series of amazing kettle trick shots, including one at AT&T Stadium, the home of 20-year Salvation Army partner, the Dallas Cowboys. The first family of viral video, The Holderness Family, best known for their hit musical parody "Xmas Jammies," raised money for The Salvation Army's Christmas assistance programs with a remake of  "Up on the Rooftop" to encourage support. Beauty and lifestyle vlogger Dulce Candy called attention to the need for a safe place for children to go as she chronicled her afternoon volunteering at The Salvation Army's Los Angeles Daycare Center. Jerry Jones and Charlotte Jones Anderson, along with The Salvation Army's National Commander, Commissioner David Jeffrey, kicked off the 2016 Red Kettle Campaign and celebrated 20 years of partnership with a satellite media tour at AT&T Stadium the day before Thanksgiving. The Dallas Cowboys also showcased the partnership and #RedKettleReason on national television just before a LIVE performance from country music star Eric Church during halftime of the Thanksgiving Day game. The campaign kickoff marked the 20th year the Cowboys organization has partnered with The Salvation Army to launch the iconic campaign during the nationally televised game. Since partnering with the team, the Red Kettle Campaign has raised nearly $2.2 billion. The Dallas Cowboys also conducted a point-of-sale campaign through the Dallas Cowboys Pro Shops, both in-store and online, giving customers the option to add a donation to The Salvation Army to their purchase. A surprise uptick in awareness and donations was also spurred by Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott's "Red Kettle Leap," which quickly became a trending topic on social media, during the Dallas Cowboys game on Sunday, December 18. Elliott called on fans to donate to the Red Kettle Campaign in $21 increments, a nod to his jersey number. Those donations, including a $21,000 contribution from Ezekiel Elliott and a generous donation match of $21,000 from a Texas couple, totaled nearly $250,000. Leading up to and on #GivingTuesday, November 29, The Salvation Army was seen and talked about during national media appearances on the TODAY show with Nick Cannon, Access Hollywood Live and Steve Harvey. The week of Christmas, TODAY aired a segment featuring a family helped by The Salvation Army's Christmas assistance program in Phoenix, AZ. Corporate partners also contributed greatly to the success of the 2016 Red Kettle Campaign. Red Kettles outside of 5,093 Walmart and Sam's Club locations across the U.S. collected $44.25 million, which contributed about 30 percent of the $147.3 million total. More than 2,400 locations of Kroger's family of stores hosted red kettles, raising a total of $16.9 million, or 11 percent of the $147.3 million total. Red Kettles at roughly 700 JCPenney stores collected a total of nearly $2.7 million for the campaign, 500 Big Lots locations raised $888,900 and 79 Bass Pro Shops locations raised nearly $400,000. From November 25 through December 11, 715 Walmart stores hosted the fifth annual Fill the Truck event, collecting more than 80,000 coats and 4,000 toys for children during the holidays. Hanes and The Salvation Army teamed up once again to provide socks to those in need. As part of their annual sock drive, Hanes donated 200,000 pairs of socks to The Salvation Army, bringing the total number of socks donated over the past eight years to more than 1.8 million pairs. Between November 1 and December 31, Dr Pepper Snapple Group donated a portion of sales to The Salvation Army for every specially marked 7UP, CANADA DRY and SQUIRT 2-liter bottle, 20-ounce bottle and 12-pack sold. Krispy Kreme hosted counter kettles at participating locations nationwide, raising over $27,000 for the Red Kettle Campaign. Krispy Kreme also donated a percentage of sales from Monday December 19, to The Salvation Army. UPS ran its Wishes Delivered campaign with The Salvation Army included in its select group of charity partners to each receive $33,333. For every wish submitted with the campaign's hashtag, UPS donated $1 and shared stories of the people and organizations who are solving problems to make a difference in communities. Cricket Wireless donated $1 per "like" on a participating local Cricket Wireless store Facebook page, raising nearly $41,000 for The Salvation Army to purchase toys for children in need offering something to smile about during the holidays. During the holidays, 3.3 million people rely on The Salvation Army to provide their families with a warm meal or toys for children on Christmas Day. In addition to the help provided during the holiday season, donations made to the red kettles help the Army provide more than 10 million nights of shelter, nearly 57 million meals and programming such as substance abuse recovery, after-school programs and emergency shelter for children and families in need year-round. In all, The Salvation Army is able to help more than 25 million people each year, thanks in large part to people's generous donations. From its humble beginnings as a program started by a Salvation Army captain in San Francisco in 1891, the Red Kettle Campaign has grown into one of the most recognizable and important charitable campaigns in the United States. It provides toys for kids, coats for the homeless, food for the hungry and countless social service programs year-round. More than 25,000 Salvation Army volunteers throughout the country ring bells and solicit donations to the red kettles. About The Salvation Army The Salvation Army, established in London in 1865, has been supporting those in need without discrimination for more than 135 years in the U.S. More than 25 million Americans receive assistance from The Salvation Army each year through a range of social services: food for the hungry, relief for disaster victims, assistance for the disabled, outreach to the elderly and ill, clothing and shelter to the homeless and opportunities for underprivileged children. For every dollar donated to The Salvation Army, 82 cents is used to support those services in 5,000 communities nationwide. The Salvation Army tracks the level of need across the country with the Human Needs Index (HumanNeedsIndex.org).

Credit: Mitch Hooper | Engagement Editor   Members of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, students of the Ohio State Student/Farmworker Alliance and people from across the country marched from Goodale Park to the Ohio Union in protest of Wendy’s refusal to join the Fair Food Program on Sunday. The Student/Farmworker Alliance is demanding the university ends its contract with Wendy’s as a way to pressure the restaurant chain to join the Fair Food Program and adhere to its standards for tomato pickers. The program has added 14 major corporations to its program, including McDonald’s, Burger King, Chipotle and Wal-Mart, but it hasn’t convinced Wendy’s to join. OSU’s contract with Wendy’s, which leases a location at the Wexner Medical Center, states the school will work to find “a resolution of the concerns of the Student Farmworkers Alliance regarding the procurement of tomatoes for the operation of Tenant’s business at the Premise that is satisfactory to Landlord in its sole discretion.” OSU spokesman Chris Davey said the university is actively working on finding a resolution for this and that “OSU has a firm commitment to social responsibility and actively supports appropriate treatment of workers.” “We have been working actively with Wendy’s to achieve a satisfactory outcome related to the concerns of the students and Coalition of Immokalee Workers that aligns with the university’s values and reinforces that commitment,” Davey said in an email. “We understand that Wendy’s also extended an offer to meet with this group of concerned students directly; the students have declined.” Previously, the university set up a meeting between Wendy’s and the Student Farmworkers Alliance, but the group declined to meet, citing a message posted to Wendy’s website dating from 2013. In that statement, which has since been updated and changed, Wendy’s said it was being targeted by CIW and that the restaurant should only have to negotiate directly with the supplier, not a third-party organization like CIW. He reiterated the statements previously made by OSU spokesmen Ben Johnson by saying the university stands by its commitment to safety and — referencing a hunger strike that students participated in last week — does not condone or support behavior that threatens the health and safety of any member of the university. After the march on Sunday, members of the Student/Farmworker Alliance ended their fast.

Samsung To Sell, Rent Refurbished Recalled Galaxy Note 7 Smartphones — But Not In The U.S. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Samsung To Sell, Rent Refurbished Recalled Galaxy Note 7 Smartphones — But Not In The U.S. Image courtesy of Reddit March 27, 2017 12:49 pm EDT By Ashlee Kieler@akieler disposing of dangerous phones galaxy note 7 not coming to the US recall refurbished rentals samsung using the parts Samsung has millions of recalled Note 7 smartphones sitting around gathering dust (and hopefully not exploding), and now the company says it may sell refurbished versions of the device (which, again, hopefully won’t explode), but that it won’t be selling these recycled products in the U.S. In response to criticism that it might just dump these recalled phones somewhere without regard to wasted materials or the environment, Samsung has announced a set of “principles,” claiming that the Note 7 devices will be recycled and processed in an environmentally-friendly way. So what does that mean, exactly? The company says it has established three ways in which it will make use of these expensive paperweights: 1. Note 7 components will be salvaged and reused; 2. Useful metals, like copper, nickel, gold, and silver, will be extracted; 3. Refurbished devices could be sold or provided as rentals, “dependent upon consultations with regulatory authorities and carriers.” But don’t expect to see cheap, refurbed Note 7s at Best Buy or Walmart anytime soon. A rep for Samsung tells Consumerist the repackaged phones will not be made available here. “Samsung will not be offering refurbished Galaxy Note7 devices for rent or sale in the U.S.,” the rep said. That news was also confirmed by a spokesperson with the Consumer Product Safety Commission, who said Samsung’s announcement did not pertain to the sale of recycled or refurbished Note 7 phones in the U.S. While the company didn’t provide details on where the refurbished phones will be available, the rep did note that product details including the name, technical specification, and price range will be announced when the device is available. As for the recycling of the Galaxy Note 7 phones, Samsung says that components such as semiconductors and camera modules will be detached by companies specializing in such services and used for test sample production purposes. Any remaining components, such as precious metals, will be extracted by eco-friendly companies specializing in this processes. In other Galaxy Note 7 news Monday, Mashable reports that the few holdouts who haven’t returned their phones to the company will no longer be able to use the devices. Citing a report from Yonhap News Agency, Mashable notes that the 3% to 4% of Note 7 phones still in use worldwide will soon receive a software update that will finally “brick” the devices. The soon-to-be pushed out update comes three months after Samsung worked with U.S. carriers to release an update that disabled the phones from charging or connecting to networks.

View Profile Image: Getty Images Print It's not listeria you have to fear this time, but metal pieces in your breaded chicken Share Tweet Pin Share Tumble Combined comments & shares on social media Since chicken's a major diet staple for most meat-eating humans, we'll cut to the chase. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Services just made their latest recall announcement, and it’s a massive (and seriously terrifying) one. Breaded chicken products that were produced between Dec. 19, 2016, and March 7, 2017, and were sent everywhere from school lunchrooms (ack!) to your local Walmart. But wait... you haven't even read the worst part yet. The ready-to-eat chicken, produced by OK Foods, involves nearly 1 million pounds of breaded chicken that authorities fear has been contaminated with "extraneous materials" — including metal! WTF is going on?! More: Yesterday's Cheese Recall Now Includes Mushrooms and Other Snacks Apparently this all happened after OK Foods "received five consumer complaints stating that metal objects were found in the ready-to-eat chicken products and by FSIS inspection personnel during verification activities. After an internal investigation, the firm identified the affected product and determined that the objects in all the complaints came from metal conveyor belting." Yiiikes. Although there have been no reports of people getting sick yet from this contamination — thank heavens for that! — anyone who does have this chicken in their fridge or freezer is advised to either toss it ASAP (duh) and/or return it for a refund. See full list of items affected here. Jeez. For now, maybe go back to packing lunch for the kids yourself, with whole foods you can make sure came from the Earth and don't contain manmade contaminants like, you know, metal.

article CHARLOTTE, N.C., March 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Carolina Global Brewing announced today the launch of their new all-natural flavored malt beverage product line: JUICEBAR COCKTAILS. Initial flavor offerings combine fruits, vegetables and herbs into a cocktail blend: Carrot Aloe Mango 4.9% alc/vol, and Pineapple Lime with Cilantro 4.7% alc/vol - in 6-packs of 12 oz cans with suggested retail price between $9.99 and $10.99. Market launches include placement in major retailers Whole Foods, Walmart, Fresh Market, Sprouts and Harris Teeter. Continue Reading JUICEBAR COCKTAILS: Fruit and vegetable juices, natural herbs and spices, lightly sweetened with natural sugar, and mixed with tasteless malt alcohol Distribution starts May 2017, in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Georgia. Retailers and markets were selected based on attractive market demographics for the growing number of health-conscious ready-to-drink (RTD) consumers. "JUICEBAR COCKTAILS is our version of 'clean and green' cocktails with all natural ingredients that you'll find at your local smoothie or juice bar. Fruit and vegetable juices, natural herbs and spices, lightly sweetened with natural sugar, and mixed with tasteless malt alcohol," says co-founder Brian Myers. This is Carolina Global Brewing's second brand series in the RTD segment, the follow-up to their regional hit: Happy Juice. "Our distribution and retail partners agree that the 'greenification' of non-alcoholic beverages is lacking in RTDs. There's room for all-natural brands like JUICEBAR COCKTAILS to gain market share. We made a great product with no artificial ingredients and our partners are excited to get it to market," says co-founder Samuel Wilson. "Ironically, even with all the new brands and flavor offerings, the category is still in need of a serious shot in the arm. Consumers enjoy a growing selection of green all-natural products everywhere in the store except RTDs. They're looking for more all-natural offerings that still taste great and fit into the ethos of a healthy lifestyle. I know this because I'm that customer as well. We're excited to work with retail buyers who celebrate the idea of change and see the enormous opportunity that JUICEBAR COCKTAILS provides to a growing customer segment," says co-founder DeAnthony Hill. JUICEBAR COCKTAILS rolls out May 1, 2017. ABOUT CAROLINA GLOBAL BREWING Founded in 2012 by three "oddball" entrepreneurs from South Carolina, Carolina Global Brewing is an adult beverage brand creator and marketing company. They grew their regional RTD hit, Happy Juice, into an 11-state footprint over 2 years and more recently shifted focus to all-natural product lines. Their second offering is JUICEBAR COCKTAILS.

REUTERS By Kaitlyn D'Onofrio / March 27, 2017 A boycott of Google and its platforms that began in the United Kingdom has spread to the United States amid backlash due to advertisements appearing next to hateful and offensive content. Last week AT&T (No. 4 on the DiversityInc 2016 Top 50 Companies for Diversity list) said in a statement, “We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate. Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s nonsearch platforms.” Johnson & Johnson (No. 8), General Motors (No. 48) and Walmart (one of DiversityInc’s 2016 25 Noteworthy Companies) also announced they would be pulling their advertisements as well. The Times in London reportedly triggered the boycott when an article reported in February that companies including Sandals Resorts, Honda, Thompson Reuters and Mercedes-Benz were among those whose advertisements on YouTube appeared alongside content including pro-ISIS videos and videos for groups with al-Qaeda affiliations. About 250 organizations have since reportedly withdrawn their advertisements from Google and its subsidiaries. For most companies, ads will still appear in Google searches. Meanwhile, shares for Alphabet (Google’s parent company) have been on the decline over the last week. Google, which has never applied to participate in the DiversityInc Top 50 competition, has an astounding lack of diversity in its leadership ranks. According to its own diversity data, women make up just 24 of leadership throughout the company. Ethnic diversity is also dismal, with leadership being 70 percent white, 25 percent Asian, 2 percent Black, 2 percent two or more races, 1 percent Hispanic and less than 1 percent “other.” The DiversityInc Top 50 Companies for Diversity, when expressed as a stock index, outperform the rest of the market, suggesting that good judgment in one area permeates throughout an organization. Morgan Stanley and RBC Capital Markets both noted that the boycott is likely to have a significant impact on Google’s long-term revenues. However, analysts with Nomura Instinet calculated that the company could lose as much as $750 million as a result. Business Insider reported: “According to the note, YouTube, which relies extensively on big brands, would take a 7.5% hit to its revenues, which are estimated to be $10.2 billion for 2017. Five of the top 20 US advertisers, which make up 7.5% of the US ad spend, have frozen their advertising with Google — alongside dozens more around the world.” Google said in a blog post it would “be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear.” In another post Philipp Schindler, chief business officer, said the company would be “taking a tougher stance” and said that its current policies work “in the vast majority of cases.” However, companies have continued announcing the boycott even after Google’s “public commitment” — indicating that perhaps its promises do not go far enough. Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP Group, said last week on CNBC that it is no longer acceptable for Google to not take ownership for the content that appears on its platforms. YouTube reportedly receives 400 hours of new content uploaded every minute. But with such massive success and power comes responsibility — and accountability. “They claim the volumes are so great, that it’s impossible to monitor,” Sorrell explained. “With success, with Google and Facebook controlling 75 percent of digital advertising — which in turn is about 30 percent of the worldwide market — with that success comes responsibility, and the responsibility is … they have to exert more control on behalf of our clients, have to take more responsibility for it. They can’t just say, ‘Look, we’re a technology company, we have nothing to do with the content that is appearing on our digital pages.’” Notably, WPP has not announced it would get behind the boycott. WPP, which also has does not participate in the DiversityInc Top 50, has a lack of diversity in its ranks as well, with just 33 percent of executive leaders being women. Only 13 percent of executive leaders are “ethnic minorities.” (Incidentally, the company came under fire last year over a £70m pay package for Sorrell, a deal 33.5 percent of the company’s shareholders voted against. According to the company’s sustainability report, “We do not currently collect or report data on pay in relation to gender at a group level.”) Media analyst for Pivotal Research Group Brian Wieser said that the company’s outlined strategy does not address how serious the situation is. “They’re saying they’re trying harder — that’s insufficient,” he said. “They don’t seem to understand the scale of the perceived problem.” In a report Pivotal downgraded Google stock from “Buy” to “Hold” in light of the “serious issues” pertaining to “brand safety.” “Although spending by advertisers who have announced their intention to suspend spending on YouTube and other Google properties is relatively small so far, we think that awareness of the incident will marginally curtail global growth this year vs. prior expectations, leading us to reduce our price target on Alphabet slightly, to $950 vs. $970 previously,” the report states. “[Google’s] approach comes across to us as attempting to minimize the problem rather than eliminating it, which is the standard we think that many large brand advertisers expect,” Pivotal said. “We think that Google will probably need to articulate goals that sound more like a zero tolerance policy, to alleviate concerns before it can fully recover.“ Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said on Fox Business last week, “What we do is, we match ads and the content, but because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn’t match.” He added that the company has had to “tighten” its policies surrounding advertisements. When asked if the company’s steps would guarantee that ads are not placed where advertisers do not want them Schmidt said, “We can in this case” but added that because “the ads come from everywhere” and sometimes come in violation of the company’s own policies, “we can’t guarantee it, but we can get pretty close.” Get DiversityInc delivered to your inbox and stay informed.

Microsoft in Washington state is Google’s identical twin sister, but because Bill Hates [Black people], and is filthy rich, everybody kisses his az and won’t challenge his lack of diversity. Any pro-Isis, al-Qaeda, Sharia law or radical Muslim terrorists ads should be challenged. For once, AmeriKKKan companies took a right stance on a Muslim issue.

Vince McMahon Signed Off On A John Cena Heel Turn Brandon Gnetz - 03/27/2017 Start Photo Gallery Back to Article Image of Over the last few weeks the WWE Universe has gotten to play a great game of revisionist history with John Cena's career. After finding out the 16 time World Champ was nearly fired before his historic run ever began, we're now also learning that Cena nearly turned heel during a pivotal time as the company's top babyface. Former WWE writer Kevin Eck was a guest on Wade Keller’s PWTorch livecast on Thursday. Among other things, he revealed that John Cena was supposed to turn heel in 2012. In fact, Vince McMahon signed off on the idea but later changed his mind. Eck said, “We talked about turning John Cena heel while I was there and you may have heard stories before. We were very close [and] we even had Vince [McMahon] sign off on it at one point and Cena was on board to do it.” Eck added, “We started making plans for it and then Vince got cold feet and we had just signed a John Cena exclusive merchandise deal with Wal-Mart and Vince came into a booking meeting one day and said ‘God, I know you guys really wanna do this but I just can’t do it.'” Eck said that the Vince was very close to pulling the trigger on the idea. It's the second time in the last seven days we've heard that Cena nearly embraced the hate, as Stephanie McMahon also revealed that she once fought for a heel turn for the Cenation leader.  What's crazier than imagining Vince finally turning Cena to the dark side, is learning who Vince had in mind to replace him as the number one good guy. Eck states that the plan was supposed to be for Sheamus to be the top babyface after Cena turned heel. Hard to believe, but CM Punk was not considered for the spot and Randy Orton was considered too abrasive for someone that would need to be on the road all the time to do media appearances and signings. The fact that Sheamus was considered over Punk tells you all you need to know about Vince's philosophy for the "top guy" in his company. Punk was as over as imaginable in 2012 and he did get a lengthy run in the main event (mostly as heel) but Vince still wants his top babyface to have the build of a super hero. Looking at the immensely jacked 70 year old, this should come as no surprise, but it's still hard to imagine Sheamus getting put in John Cena's spot.  Top WWE Stories:  Huge Post-WrestleMania Angle Teased At WWE Live Event Two WWE Stars Removed From Smackdown Roster WWE Fan Dies At Live Event Listen to Comicbook.com's Over The Ropes podcast:  Start Photo Gallery Back to Article Image of Brandon Gnetz @ComicBook Upcoming Movies LIFE Mar 24 2017 Power Rangers (2017) Mar 24 2017 Ghost in the Shell Mar 31 2017 Teen Titans: The Judas Contract Apr 4 2017 Your Name Apr 7 2017 Full List Comicbook.com Spider-Man: Homecoming - Official Trailer #2 Pop Culture Now Watch Stephen King's IT Reboot Trailer #1 Teaser Comicbook.com Here's Why Power Rangers Cut Jason And Kimberly's Kiss Marvel New Spider-Man: Homecoming Trailer Released DC Justice League Trailer Proves Marvel's Superior Strategy WWE Paige Issues Lengthy Statement On Leaked Videos What's Hot: Marvel Is Spider-Man: Homecoming Basically Iron Man 4?

The engine overpowers the chassis and suspension, thus it isn’t exactly the easiest ‘Maro to drive. The all-new one, meanwhile, is on a different level altogether. When the Camaro Team went back to the drawing board, figuring out what the 2017 model year ZL1 should be all about, and Al Oppenheiser made it clear that the newcomer needs to be a helluva lot more hardcore than the model it replaces. But at the same time, it has to be more manageable to control both on the limit and in day-to-day scenarios like going to Walmart. A lot of engineering, testing, and fine-tuning later, the real deal made it into production, and Motor Trend came to the same conclusion. It’s an entirely different package, a more complete machine than the foregoing model. “Since it has pretty much the same LT4 supercharged V8 as the Corvette Z06, did the car experience any overheating or heat soaking?” In short, no. MT’s Jonny Lieberman said that such things never happened during a week’s worth of testing, and that’s a breath of fresh air considering that the Z06 went into limp mode when Motor Trend put it through its paces in 2015. The Camaro ZL1 also put the BMW M4 GTS to shame around the figure eight, and believe it or not, it also bested the Shelby GT350R and Acura NSX. That’s an awesome stat for a controlled environment, but what is even more surprising than the figure eight is that the ZL1 is also fun to thrash around on a backroad. Especially one with demanding corners. What’s most intriguing about Motor Trend’s review on the ZL1 is the hot lap. Randy squeezed 1:26.15 out of the six-speed manual-equipped ZL1 and 1:26.47 out of the 10-speed automatic. And that speaks volumes on what Oppenheiser and Team Camaro achieved with the big bad Camaro from a driver’s point of view. Such bewildering performance comes at a price, though.

Or how changing one word brought in more than $300,000 in revenue. While that kind of result is a little uncommon, split or A/B testing is undeniably beneficial to your website, your marketing, and your business. Whether you’re an SMB or an enterprise multinational, hypothesizing and testing simply makes you better. You know you can test your landing pages, your email marketing, your PPC campaigns, your copy, your images, your design, and your colors. And as an added bonus, it doesn’t take long to master A/B testing and make it an everyday part of your business decisions and goals…even if you’re an absolute novice to start. In fact, everyone is on the split test bandwagon. From the smallest of the SMBs to industry giants like Amazon and Walmart, there is no company or industry that doesn’t get actionable insight from it — from finance to SaaS, from bloggers to entrepreneurs, from A to Z. And that, of course, includes those of you in the expanding e-commerce game. Split Testing and E-commerce As a savvy and growth-minded e-retailer, you’re likely using A/B testing for a wide variety of purposes already. When it comes to your retail platform, you can test and improve virtually every aspect: Test your homepage: The inclusion of trust badges, navigation menu and links, layout, dropdown menus versus elaborate lists, slider versus static images, video, number of columns, subscription form, colors, and your call-to-action. Test your product pages: Create a sense of urgency with flash sales, limited numbers, free shipping until X o’clock, include video reviews or tutorials, customer testimonials or reviews, high-quality photos and a 360-degree view, and the placement of those items. Beef up your copy, change the font, tweak the colors. Test your checkout funnel: Add familiar trust seals, security promises, a money-back guarantee, eliminate steps, 1-page checkout versus 2-page checkout (or 3-page checkout), the order of checkout, requiring registration, and the details you ask for. Test your category pages, your search results, and your thank-you page. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. An e-commerce store could literally test until the cows come home. There are dozens of things to hypothesize and optimize. It works, and nearly everyone is doing it. 75% of the top 500 retailers online use it to improve their portal, ramp up their revenue, and better their customer experience. Examples abound of retailers using split testing to improve conversions, sales, average order value, and more. Are you in on that? Split Testing: A Quick Review The basic idea of split or A/B testing is to compare the performance of two slightly different versions of the same page (or email, or ad). You have the version you’re currently using (called the control) and the version you believe might do better because of the one thing you changed (called the variant). For a set period of time (the lower your traffic, the longer you’ll want to run the test), you send half of your traffic to A, and half to B. Then you compare their performance metrics. But you don’t just change for the sake of change. You don’t test for the sake of testing. You want to have a data-backed hypothesis beforehand. The basic steps for a successful split test include: Look at the existing data for the page, email, or ad under review. How is it performing? Set a goal for it. You might want to increase the CVR, or decrease cart abandonment, or increase sign-ups, or lower the bounce rate. Come up with a hypothesis for how to reach that goal. For example, you might believe that you’ll increase sales if the product page includes a video review. Create a variation to test your hypothesis. Run the test for an adequate length of time. Analyze the two sets of data. Implement the variation if it does better. That’s it. Let’s Talk About Pricing As a retailer — e-commerce or otherwise — setting your prices can be the most difficult part of your business. Many business owners make the mistake of pricing too low, believing it’ll give a much-needed boost to sales. That could happen, but it can just as easily backfire and create the impression that your products are inferior quality, cheap, and likely to break, resulting in fewer sales. On the other hand, you might try pricing higher than your competition to create the impression of high quality and luxury. Again, that could happen…but your customers might also see it as just more expensive without any additional value. Where does that leave you? You guessed it…fewer sales. It’s a fine line. The perfect price point needs a lot of data to inform it: production costs, operational costs, storage and shipping costs, as well as the prices of your direct and indirect competition. You can keep one eye on them with a service like Prisync. It’ll collect and monitor your prices and inventory while comparing it against the latest data on your competitors. Users report an average profit margin increase of 20 percent using the platform. While a tool like that can help, there’s another often-overlooked option to zero in on the perfect price: split testing. Split Testing and Your Prices Pricing obviously affects your conversion (i.e. your sale) rate. Too high, too low, too many hidden fees, and on and on. It has to be “perfect.” Your would-be customers want competitive pricing. In fact, 80% of them list it as an important feature when they’re making a purchase decision. Prices rise, prices fall. They fluctuate based on supply and demand, the behavior of your competition, even the time of year. Keep on top of it with a concrete split testing strategy. Here are a few ideas and hypotheses to get you started on the path to price perfection. Charm Pricing Hypothesis: Changing my prices to end in 99 will increase sales. This tactic is the practice of ending prices with either 9, 95, or 99. You’ve probably noticed it on plenty of e-commerce websites and at other retailers. Gumroad found that products with a .99 price outperformed those ending .00 across the board. It usually works, but there’s a rather important caveat: the leftmost digit needs to come down by one. This is called the Left Digit Effect. When we compare $3.00 to $2.99, our brain automatically registers the perceived cost of the first as three dollars, and the second as two dollars…despite the fact that the actual difference is only one cent. Charm prices increased sales by an average of 24% in studies conducted by William Poundstone for his book Priceless. Will it work for you? There’s only one way to find out (hint: split test it). Prestige Pricing Hypothesis: Rounding my prices to the nearest .00 will improve my conversion rate. The opposite of charm pricing is known as prestige pricing. And it can work too…depending on the type of products you’re selling. Most of our buying decisions are based on emotion first and logic second. But some items — say a new laptop or smartphone — depend a bit more on logic than others. We research, compare, check out features, read reviews, ask for recommendations, and so on. We want to get the best product for the best price (charm pricing works great here). But other products are much more of an emotional purchase. Luxury goods fall into this category. We buy them not because we necessarily need them, but because they give us an emotional boost (make us feel good, elevate our status, and so forth). This is where prestige pricing can work marvels. Our brains process prices ending in .00 more easily, and that allows us to stay focused on the emotional wallop that the purchase will bring us. We’re free to stay focused on the good feeling rather than bothering with “complicated” numbers. The price just feels good. Check out luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and see for yourself. Are your products under the luxury, emotional umbrella? Test prestige pricing to discover the answer. Anchor Pricing Hypothesis: Listing the original price with the discounted price will result in more sales for my current promotion. Anchoring is a common cognitive bias. When making a decision, we tend to rely heavily on the first piece of information we’re given. That can work in your favor when pricing in general, and especially during sales and promotions. Web hosts — like Bluehost, pictured below with its “normally $X.XX” pricing — do this all the time. Because of the anchoring effect, we tend to think of the original (i.e. first) price as the true value of the product, so the discounted price seems like that much more of a deal. We all love a deal! By including an original, list, or manufacturer’s suggested retail price, we set the perceived value of the item. Any price below that makes the decision to purchase very easy. Experiment with placement, font, color, and size of the original and discounted prices for maximum effect. Installment Pricing Hypothesis: If I break my prices into X equal payments rather than one large sum, more people will purchase. You’ve seen this one on late-night infomercials and the shopping channel. Why? Because they know what motivates people to open their wallets. Installment payments let even an expensive item seem very affordable. Instead of $750, it’s just ten easy payments of $75, or five of $150, or three of $250. This is another strategy that leans on the anchor effect. The first — or in this case, full — price sets the perceived value, while the individual installment amount is a steal by comparison. Some buyers are even willing to pay a higher price for the convenience of installment pricing. Will it amount to greater sales for you? Maybe, maybe not. But it can’t hurt to test and know for sure. Discount the “Right” Way Hypothesis: Discounts expressed as a percent are more effective than those expressed as a dollar amount. Everyone loves to save money. Sales, promos, discounts, and coupons work for that very reason. But are all discounts created equal? Test and discover. You can indicate a discount of a percent off, or by the dollar amount saved. One will likely be more effective at motivating people to buy than the other. But which one will work for you? Only a split test can tell you definitively, but as a rule of thumb, you want to express the discount in whatever way makes the number bigger. Oversimplified? Perhaps…but we love to save big. If your product is less than $100, the percent off will be the bigger number. Which sounds better: Save $7, or 25% off? Both reflect the same discount on an item normally sold for $28, but I’d wager dollars to donuts that more people would respond to the 25% off label. If your product is more than $100, do the opposite. The actual dollar amount saved will always be the more impressive figure. Save $75, or 33% off? Split test to determine what your customers would rather see. Other Ways to Test Pricing You don’t have to stop there. Test tax in versus tax out, volume discounts, combo pricing, higher pricing that includes shipping, lower pricing with shipping extra, and more. The Tools of the Trade Now that you know what to test, you need to actually test it. There are many fine tools and services out there to make it fast, easy, and convenient, including: Google Analytics (located under Behavior > Experiments) Unbounce (landing page builder with A/B testing capabilities) Visual Website Optimizer Optimizely In WordPress, you can opt for a simple plugin: Nelio AB Testing WordPress Calls to Action Title Experiments Free Simple Page Tester Over half of all e-commerce traffic is mobile traffic, so make sure your tool of choice is set up for mobile testing. Want to test your intuition? Check out Behave (formerly called Which Test Won?) and test yourself against actual split test results. Can you pick the winners? Ultimately, you don’t want to always be testing every little thing, but a few choice tests can deliver big results. Big results are the name of the game. Big profit, big growth, big improvements. And all from the little split test. Have you tried split testing your prices yet? What tools and approach did you take? Let me know your thoughts on social media.   Image Credits Featured Photo: Pixabay In-post Photo #1: Maxime Lorant/Commons.wikimedia.org In-post Photo #2: Price Chart/Gumroad.com All screenshots taken by Aaron Agius, March 2017   ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Related Posts 5 Tips For Running Effective Facebook Ads Split Testing Campaigns How to Choose the Right KPIs for Your E-Commerce Store 5 Things to Optimize on Your E-Commerce Site to Gain More Sales Google Search to Display Gas Prices in Local Pack ADVERTISEMENT Bio Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Latest Posts Aaron Agius Managing Director at Louder Online Aaron Agius is an experienced search, content and social marketer.

Walmart, General Motors and Starbucks have now joined AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, GSK and Enterprise Holdings and a growing list of U.S. companies who have said that they will stop all ad spending on Google except for search.  That includes no ads on YouTube and the two million sites that are part of Google's ad network. More than 250 organizations in the UK including the British government, Toyota and McDonald’s have stopped advertising on YouTube, according to The Times, whose investigation triggered the global boycott.  When asked if Google can ensure that ads won't be placed with offensive content, co-founder Eric Schmidt said: "We can't guarantee it but we can get pretty close."

CDT March 27, 2017 GameStop employee Randi Taber stacks copies of "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3" during a launch event for the highly anticipated video game at a GameStop Corp. store November 7, 2011 in North Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo: Ethan Miller/Getty Images, 2011 Getty Images) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Shares of GameStop slid more than 12% in afternoon trading Friday after the video game retailer reported a drop in fourth-quarter sales and announced plans to close at least 150 of its 7,500 stores worldwide. GameStop faces increased competition from retailers such as Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart while more players purchase games digitally — whether on traditional gaming consoles or on their smartphones or tablets. The video game and consumer electronics retailer's woes are the latest example of a brick-and-mortar retailer impacted by consumers' rush to purchase products online. J.C. Penney and Sears Holding have announced plans to shutter several locations. No word yet on if any of GameStop's roughly 40 Minnesota locations will close. GameStop's struggles were illustrated by a 13.6% drop in global sales, to $3.05 billion, from a year ago. GameStop blamed weak sales of certain blockbuster video games released during the critical holiday season and "aggressive console promotions" by other retailers. New hardware sales plunged 29%, while new software sales dropped nearly 20%. "We encountered stiff headwinds as we completed the third year of the console cycle," GameStop CEO Paul Raines said. Larry Perkins, CEO and founder of SierraConstellation Partners, said the gaming market follows the path of other specialty retailers in moving toward more diversified offerings. "Not only are they getting hammered by the online retailers and big box that have an inherent cost advantage through no retail real estate footprint or a much larger footprint that they can leverage with other products, but the movement to mobile-based games is creeping up mightily," Perkins said. While growth in video games shrinks, GameStop said its Technology Brands business, which includes cellphone retailers such as Spring Mobile, posted a 44% increase in sales during the fourth quarter. GameStop's Collectibles business, which features the apparel retailer ThinkGeek, rose 28% because of strong interest in Pokemon toys and gear. This year, GameStop plans to open 65 Technology Brand stores and 35 Collectibles stores and will close 2% to 3% of its GameStop stores, which amounts to at least 150 stores. A potential bright spot for GameStop's gaming business is the launch of the Nintendo Switch this month. Mizuho analyst San Q. Phan said GameStop has indicated "its multiple replenishments since launch have sold out in hours." Microsoft will introduce a console dubbed Project Scorpio, an upgraded Xbox One which will support native 4K gaming and virtual reality. © 2017 USATODAY.COM CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Murder-for-hire suspect takes her own life A stranger emailed me a warning about blood clots.

Most conservatives congratulate their good sense. We need a new bill that repeals all of ObamaCare, not one that leaves parts of it intact. The federal government needs to get completely out of the insurance business. ObamaCare wasn't a health care bill as everyone calls it. It only gave people insurance they couldn't use because the deductibles were so high. The free market works, but give a little help to those that really need it."

"To the person that wrote that GOP lost in the health care and they must be incompetent so we should start getting rid of them. If I remember correctly, there wasn't one Democrat who voted for that health plan. So don't put all the blame on the Republicans. ..." "I'd like to tip my hat to those conservative Republican representatives who refused to let themselves be bullied by a sitting president, passing a bill that was short of thorough thought, compromising the wishes of the general public. It would be in the president's best interest to take this shortcoming to heart, to think through his next steps in the office to represent the nation from the bipartisan perspective instead of pushing his personal agenda. If lessons learned in this moment fall short of expectations, the exit door won't be that far in the future." "I'm so glad to hear today that it looks like the GOP health plan is going to be scrapped and we will still have the ACA. I was not fond of everything with the ACA. There were a lot of problems and it does need to be tweaked, but we didn't need to throw the whole thing out, we simply needed to make it better for everyone. The new GOP health plan actually was going to make things worse. It was going to cost you more for less insurance. How was that better? The only thing the GOP was interested in was a checkmark in the column that we got rid of it. That's not good enough when millions would have lost their insurance.

"Can’t everyone follow Canada’s lead and name everyone Liam and Emma, and let their little personalities flower or droop based on their own small sweet merits?"  (Dreamstime)   By Heather Mallick Columnist Mon., March 27, 2017 “It’s not a name, it’s a diagnosis,” a teacher in a German survey said of the name “Kevin,” which was the most popular male baby name in France in 1991 but is, apparently, loathed in Germany. One presumes many French things are cordially detested in Germany and vice versa. They are both rule-driven nations and Kévin, as the French spell it, is a deviation. A further study on this German “Kevinismus” was done by a sociologist named Jürgen Gerhards. I’m saying nothing. Except boys named Jürgen had better be excellent soccer players if they ever hope to survive a childhood in France. I note that soccer’s Jürgen Klinsmann married a Debbie and named his children Jonathan and Laila. (The most popular name for German boys is Ben.) We need to talk about Kevins. I kept their dilemma stowed away for years. It didn’t match the vision I had of France where I assumed boys were named Charles-Philippe and Sébastien. I was wrong — the most popular boy’s name is now Lucas — but right too. Apparently Kévin was a thing, a detestable thing. I myself am fond of Kevins. But in France, babies named Kévin are seen as louts who smoke while breastfeeding, get poor grades and grow up to be no-hopers. I’m thinking of the dreadful Kevin O’Leary. Perhaps the French have a point. Article Continued Below I have a similar condition, known as Jasonismus. While I acknowledge the fine contribution made by good Jasons everywhere — although the only one I can think of is actor Jason Bateman — most of the Jasons I’ve encountered have been trouble in a baseball cap. For every headline, there’s a Jason. “Florida man arrested for stealing 6.5 pounds of cow tongue from Walmart” is Jason Puckett. “Florida man killed nine ducklings with a lawn mower” is Jason Scott Falbo II. Then there’s Jason Kenney. My question is, are Jasons born or bred, and do misspellings make things worse? There are Jaysons and Jasens just as there are one-letter families where the kids are Kourtney, Khim, Khloe, Khristinn, Kellie, Krystal, Kacee etc. The letter K is ill-starred, is it not. The concept of nominative determinism suggests that people become their name, for instance, taking on work that reflects it. British gardening is an extreme case: Jane Fearnley-Whittingstall, Pippa Greenwood, Alan Titchmarsh and Bob Flowerdew. Still, there is no proof that names matter one way or another. I was named Heather, unfortunately. It’s an indefinite name and I am a definite sort of person. You have to live up to a lousy name, test your moral iron in the smithy of your soul, go out and be the gentle Jason no one expects. I would like a name with an N. Vanessa, maybe, or Nina, the kind of people who can bang a gavel and read maps. Once, a man who sexually harassed me in a brutal way told me I had the wrong name. It should be something exotic like Esmerelda or Antigone, he said, stroking me. His name was Fred. A Heather is the kind of person who has a Swiffer in her desk drawer and a Bounce sheet in her purse for static cling. A Heather is the type I call a QuiteThe. “That’s quite the hairdo you have there,” she’ll say. Of your trip to Sarasota, she says, “That’s quite the vacay.” Sure, there were mean preppy Heathers in the ’80s and they made movies about them but those Heathers died. Every morning the oddly named people of Trump World astonish me anew. Who are these male oddities elected by Americans, I wonder. Alabama’s Jefferson Beauregard Sessions looks like a varmint popping his head out of a tiny hole. His Senate replacement is Luther Strange III, who is six-foot-nine and whose father could have put a stop to it by calling him Simon. There’s Trey Gowdy, the notoriously stupid Louie Gohmert, Lamar Alexander, Steny Hoyer and an endless streams of Mitches and Mikes. The most senior senators are Patrick, Orrin, Thad and Chuck. The House has a JohnDonJim doll collection. From boys to men they grew. What was their parents’ thinking as they saw them in the bassinet? Our name’s Issa, let’s call him Darrell, as in our name’s Coccus, let’s call him Strepto. There is cruel work being done at cribside. Can’t everyone follow Canada’s lead and name everyone Liam and Emma, and let their little personalities flower or droop based on their own small sweet merits? That would be fair. hmallick@thestar.ca Read more about: Germany, France Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

Two volunteers tightened red headgear snug around his chin. Jordan Price hadn’t planned to fight. The 18-year-old and his older brother had signed up as a joke. But it was too late to back out now. Price insisted to friends that he wasn’t nervous, but he sounded as though he were convincing himself. He hadn’t even trained, a choice his anxious eyes indicated he’d now begun to regret at least a little. Then a shout of encouragement broke his concentration. “Tear em up, Price!” Bill Price, two years older, cried out, enthusiastically smacking the black boxing gloves now fastened to his brother’s fists. The bell rang. Time to brawl. One weekend every March, almost every resident in this town crowds the tan-and-gray bleachers of the local armory to watch their friends and neighbors beat each other bloody. The boxing-brawling event – known as “The Rough N Rowdy” – draws more than 2,000 spectators a night in a 3,000-person city nestled so deep in the mountains that your cellphone won’t ring. The winners leave with a trophy, a jacket and a check for $1,000 – the same take-home as a few weeks of soot-covered work in the local mines. “People love violence. You’ve got a bunch of people down here who just want to show they’re a badass,” said Breyer Morgan, 21, who has been coming to the fights since he was a little boy and has worked the bell at the event for the past three years. “They see that $1,000, and you’ve got people coming out of the woodwork. There is nothing else to do out here . . . and that $1,000, that’s a whole lot of beer, man.” McDowell County was once the largest coal-exporting county in the United States. At its peak in the 1950s, when the county had 100,000 residents, Welch was a bustling downtown that housed the state’s first multilevel parking garage and was surrounded by a smattering of vibrant villages planted in “the howlers” – the valleys that lay beneath the winding highways that cut through the surrounding Appalachian Mountains. It wasn’t long after its height that the mines began to close, the beginning of a half-century of economic collapse that would rob McDowell of its jobs. The prospect of prosperity went with them. Welch is now a graveyard of shuttered storefronts sitting in the shadow of empty hillsides. Four out of every 5 people moved away as the coal industry faltered. Local shops closed. Even the local Walmart closed last year. McDowell is the state’s poorest county, home to one of the shortest life expectancies in the nation. The people who coal left behind here have a movie theater, a dollar store, a liquor shop and a few fast food joints. On weekends, and many weeknights, people gather around 30-packs of beer in their garages; there’s no bar and the nearest watering hole is nearly an hour’s drive. But every March, when the first blades of grass break through the melting snow, they still have the Rough N Rowdy. The Price brothers first attended this tournament as boys, traveling the 30 minutes from their home in War – a small town on West Virginia’s southern rim – to stare in wonderment as their older cousins and uncles stepped into the ring to be pummeled. Now it was Jordan’s turn. Much of his family – his father, stepmother, a sister and a brother-in-law – settled in the front row, some wearing custom-designed T-shirts declaring their allegiance to “Team Price.” The rules of the brawl are simple: Anyone between the ages of 18 and 35 can sign up so long as they haven’t boxed professionally. After passing a physical, they enter a single-elimination tournament to compete in refereed boxing matches with three one-minute rounds. Though a few serious fighters lurk in the field, most are untrained, taking to the worn ring to see if their playground prowess will yield a few moments of glory. Most have little chance of fighting more than once. The annual bouts happen during the first weekend of the month, just after many here have received their government assistance checks. That means fighters are more likely to have the $10 buy-in and their family cheering sections have cash for the $3 hot dogs drenched in warm chili. There’s no beer sold inside, so small groups dot the parking lot, tailgates gathered around coolers of Bud Light. Jordan Price threw the first punch of his bout – striking near the top of his opponent’s headgear. For two minute-long rounds, Jordan landed blow after blow, each connection of glove and flesh punctuated by the crowd’s elated howl. His overwhelmed opponent, another local boy fighting in his first Rough N Rowdy, ducked his head in fear, flailing his arms, unaimed, finding little but air as Jordan ducked and bobbed. With six seconds left in the second round, the match was called. A technical knockout. Jordan had won. Bill Price would have similar luck in his match, which began about 10 minutes after his brother’s. It was a scrappy fight with little style or technique. After three minutes of pawing at and chasing each other around the ring, the judges concluded that the elder Price brother had landed more blows. Bill, too, would advance to fight in the second round the following night. “The Price is right!” an announcer declared from ringside, prompting a roar. After hugs from his brother, his girlfriend and his father, Bill Price took a seat with Jordan near the front row as they cheered on the others, most of whom they knew from school. “Look at him! Muhammad Ali!” Jordan wailed a few fights later, as a childhood classmate stood victorious over his defeated foe. “McDowwwell County!” Bill shouted as he leapt from his seat, both arms stretched in the air. The Rough N Rowdy event was created by Christopher MacCorkle Smith, 45, a towering former boxer who, at his wife’s suggestion, left selling real estate in favor of hosting and promoting amateur boxing tournaments. The venture started out rocky, with events stumbling financially in Richmond, Virginia, and Charleston, West Virginia. He turned instead to a small West Virginia coal town called Williamson. “It was the last show we were going to do,” Smith said. “Either we were gong to do well here or we were going to hang it all up.” The Williamson event drew dozens of eager participants and thousands of spectators. Locals cherished the chance to duke it out with their childhood friends – and rivals – in the ring. Entire families came out to support each fighter, some of whom came straight from the mines to their bouts, their faces still a smoky gray. To foster local rivalries, Smith began having fighters “call out” potential opponents. In Welch, one local fighter vowed to stand over his defeated opponents and make a chicken call. Another pledged to train for the fight by eating only Krispy Kreme doughnuts. A brawler from the next county over said he’d defeat any McDowell County fighter who wanted a piece of him and that anyone who beat him could have his girlfriend. “Your girl is ours now!” came a shout from the crowd when that fighter went down for the count in his first match. In between each round, barely clad women compete to be voted the crowd’s favorite ring girl, waving cardboard round cards above their heads as they dance, with varying degrees of rhythm, to the rap song “Ms. New Booty.” They, too, stand to win a cash prize of $1,000. “See, in West Virginia we don’t have any pro sports teams, we don’t have any semipro teams. We don’t have many concerts. We don’t have NASCAR,” said Leon Ramsey, chairman of the State Athletic Commission, as he hung out near ringside. “West Virginians flock to these events.” By the second night of fighting, the mood had changed. The room was still packed, but it was no longer overflowing. The county fair atmosphere had morphed into something more akin to a serious boxing tournament. Many fighters who win their first-round matchups at the brawl drop out before the second night. Most claim it’s due to injury or sickness, what Smith has termed the “chicken flu.” After a successful opening night, many local fighters, especially those whose first fight was against a high school buddy who happened to be less prepared then they were, correctly conclude that they’ve got little chance of winning the tournament – and all they think about is the physical and emotional pain they’d probably have to endure. Jordan Price was having those thoughts. He woke up bruised and sore the morning after his first-round victory. A cough, which he said he’d been nursing for a few weeks, had evolved overnight into a full cold. But even the suggestion that he could back out of the tournament earned him hours of mocking from his father, brother, sisters and an uncle or two who stopped by the family’s hilltop home. His father, Bill Price Sr., who fixes up and trades cars for a living, was one of 20 children in an extended family born and raised on this hill. Now he, his siblings, and their offspring live in the homes and trailers where they had been raised a generation before. “Prices don’t die, we multiply,” Jordan said with a smirk, pointing down at the nearby houses, white dots scattered across the brown mountain, where other family members live. The brothers both hope to leave McDowell, though they both acknowledge that they probably will end up spending their lives on this hill above War. Bill Jr. hasn’t worked much since graduating high school last year, but he has asked around at the coal mines, where workers confident in the new presidential administration insist that this will be the year, after decades of decline, that the coal jobs come back. “I hope they’re right,” he mumbles sheepishly. “Things are going to get better.” Jordan, set to graduate this spring, had considered trying to become a game warden or taking a $14-an-hour gig as a steel welder in North Carolina. But for now, he’s staying put. His family is here, even if nothing much else is. By the time they enter the armory for the second night of fights, both Price brothers are in sweatpants and T-shirts. They’ve come up with a plan – rather than face other opponents, they’re going to fight each other and Jordan’s going to let his older brother win. “They’re blood brothers!” Smith exclaimed into the microphone moments later. “They’ve said that they’ve thrown down many times before! But this time it’s in the ring!” It wasn’t much of a match, with Jordan largely crouching in defense as his brother landed halfhearted blows to his body. After two rounds, Jordan quit the match. And Bill, a few minutes later, dropped out of the tournament. They retreated to the crowd as fans. They shouted for “T-Rod” Terry Foster, a baby-faced local baseball star from the small town of Cucumber who lasted several rounds in the heavyweight division. And Dakota “Cody” Kennedy, a lightweight who hopped around the ring in a circle before bursting forward with each punch. Both made it deep, but most of the local fighters ended up bested by outsiders. Even the ring-girl prize went to someone from far away: Mercedes Gagnon, a bubbly blonde 21-year-old who had driven nearly 400 miles from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Gagnon donned the black winner’s jacket as she posed for pictures, vowing to use her prize money to fund a vacation for her and her boyfriend. Her two-day trip to Welch was over. The Price brothers were across the room, each with an arm slung over the shoulder of a girlfriend. They exited into a dark, cold night and headed back to War. The Rough N Rowdy, its lights and excitement, would be gone until next year.

Grand champion was Fairview Food Market in Fairview. Jerome Country Market in Jerome was named reserve champion.     The beef and pork frankfurters, also known as hot dogs, are made with high quality ingredients and spices, a natural casing and no fillers, said Craig Hindes, Scott Meats owner.  The recipe that makes these franks better than most is a secret, he said. It was developed through trial and error over many years.  An "array of spices" is used, said Dave Pruim, smokehouse/sausage manager at Scott Meats.  These franks have "more spices than most," said James Hindes, plant manager and Craig Hindes' son.  "They're full-flavored," Craig Hindes said. "We go all out and make them the best we can."  They don't skimp to keep costs down, he said.  Scott Meats frankfurters sell for $4.99 per pound. For comparison, Walmart sells 15-ounce Ball Park Brand Beef Franks eight packs for $3.48.  At the competition, judges evaluate each entry for internal and external appearance and edibility.  "You have to learn how to win these things," Craig Hindes said.  Scott Meats had four entries: whole turkey, frankfurter, snack stick and beef jerky.   The philly cheese steak snack stick came in fourth. It's lower placement was likely because the white cheese inside looks like fat, and took away from the internal appearance score, Craig Hindes said.  They entered the philly cheese steak rather than barbecue, teriyaki or another flavor, because it's a customer favorite and something different compared to other entrants.  "If you're selling it, and customers love it, don't change anything," James Hindes said, quoting judges at the competition.  Even on a Wednesday morning, the store was busy.  "I care about the judges with money in their pockets," Craig Hindes said.  Customers come from all over Michigan, including Detroit, Grand Rapids and Holland, he said.  The business recently moved to 260 E. Broadway, but it's still easy for longtime customers to find - it's across the street from the previous location.  People have asked why the business hasn't moved out of Muskegon Heights, Craig Hindes said.  His response?  "If people want to buy my stuff, they can come to me," he said. "The city needs it. The people here are great. They're all really friendly."  Craig Hindes purchased K.J. Scott Meat Company in 1983. He had worked for the previous owner since 1975. At the time, the business was located in a rented building at the corner of Broadway and Hoyt.  In 1985, a new 4,000-square-foot location was built on East Broadway Avenue.   The current location opened on Nov. 25, 2016. The former warehouse for C.J. Wholesale Toy Company is 13,000 square feet.  A family operation, all the Hindes children have been involved in the business since they were teens. James Hindes, 28, started working at the store when he was 14. Kailey Hindes, the youngest, works on Saturdays - what would be her day off.  Sydney Hindes is the office administrator. Madison Kartes is moving back to the area with her husband, and will get back into the family business soon.   Matriarch Ann Hindes also chips in when she's not working as a registered nurse at the intensive care unit at Gerber Memorial Hospital in Fremont.  There are 26 employees in all. The whole family "just wants to be in it," Craig Hindes said.   Countdown to Tigers' opener April 3 Over/under on Tigers wins well behind Indians Ausmus: Norris must work through mental hurdle of 'dead arm' Castellanos batting second or fifth: Which benefits Tigers more?

Tags Dividends Business Business Are dividends good? The Business Times | Cai Haoxiang | Monday, Mar 27, 2017 Photo: The Straits Times Cai Haoxiang The Business Times Monday, Mar 27, 2017 In an age dominated by the "D" word, such as digitalisation and disruption, brick-and-mortar businesses seem almost quaint. Yet these businesses tend to have cash flows, and investing in them can be magical with another "D" - dividends. This week, we touch on one of the oldest debates in investing and corporate finance: Are dividends good? At first glance, why not? Dividends refer to the share of profits that business owners receive as cash. If you don't want to get your hands dirty setting up a business, you can still get dividends by investing in the stock market. It is not easy to evaluate a good company to invest in, but whether you've spent time thinking about it or not, the investing process itself can be astonishingly quick. With a brokerage account linked to a bank account, you can just go online, enter the stock you want to buy, and pay the asking price of the market. At the appropriate time every year, you then get some dividends directly credited to your bank. The money just shows up. You didn't have to lift a finger for it. Nameless, faceless employees at a sprawling enterprise slogged hard on your behalf. They could be humble cashiers behind a McDonald's counter. They could be someone like the late Steve Jobs, whose brilliance powered the development of the iPhone. Dividends are a wondrous capitalist invention for workers, most of whom will never be a boss in their lives. Hold enough stocks and bonds, and you are free to stop working if the income you get from your investments can pay for your living expenses. Dividends can thus be an important source of income for retirees. At every annual general meeting (AGM), there will always be that one "uncle" standing up and asking the chairman to please increase his dividend payouts, thank you very much. The emphasis on dividends has thus made real estate investment trusts, which distribute the bulk of their rental income back to unitholders, very popular. Fund houses have also been selling dividend-oriented funds like hot cakes. Dividends, they never tire of saying, contribute a significant portion of a stock's total return over time. Dividends sound sexy. Pros of paying dividends But theorists have long wondered if dividends matter to a company's value. A corporate finance theorem developed by 20th-century US economists Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller stated that in a perfect world with no taxes or transaction costs, and where investors borrow or lend at the same rate, the value of a firm is not affected by its dividend policy. Others suggested that dividends do have benefits that will improve firm value. One powerful idea is that once profits are in the bank, investors prefer them back in the form of dividends. They don't like the company using those profits to invest in future projects, which could generate a larger return. This is known as the "bird in the hand" theory. Dividends in the hand are cold, hard cash and completely riskless. Investing a company's profits will always carry the possibility that managers will miscalculate. Because dividend-paying companies are perceived as less risky, they can raise funds at a lower cost. Having a lower cost of equity theoretically increases a company's share price. A second argument for dividends is its signalling effect. The act of initiating a dividend payout or increasing a dividend can signal positive news about a company. Conversely, cutting a dividend or, worse, cancelling one hints at trouble on the way. Some companies take pride in increasing their annual dividend every year. US discount store and supermarket chain Walmart is one such example. By contrast, not paying a dividend despite having a cash hoard can make investors suspicious. Certain Chinese companies listed here come to mind. Investors have long grumbled about some of them not being able to offer even a token payout. And as a result, investors say, valuations remain low. Cons of paying dividends Managements have offered various explanations, or excuses, depending on your perspective. Some companies with a founder-executive chairman owning a large number of shares, for example, have said that the chairman does not like the idea of his money being taxed upon withdrawal. Some also said that their banks don't like the idea. Why lend money to a company if all the company does is use the cash to pay a dividend to its owners? Dividends can be fantastic for shareholders, but do nothing for a company's debtholders. So dividends aren't all good. An excessive focus on dividends can even be unproductive. After all, we buy shares for total returns, which include dividends as well as capital gains. Dividend-paying companies might even offer lower returns than non-dividend-paying companies. A company that pays most of its profits as dividends is considered a mature company which cannot grow much any more. Utilities companies and telcos come to mind. As Fidelity legend Peter Lynch once said in his book, One Up on Wall Street, a sure sign of a slow-growing company is how it pays a generous and regular dividend. "Corporate managers would much prefer to expand the business, an effort that always enhances their prestige, than to pay a dividend, an effort that is mechanical and requires no imagination," Mr Lynch wrote. It doesn't mean that these dividend payers are doing the wrong thing. Sometimes, that's the best use of the company's money. But shareholders cannot expect much from these companies, he said. "If growth in earnings is what enriches a company, then what's the sense of wasting time on sluggards?" By contrast, the biggest gains can be made in small, fast-growing companies which do not have the luxury of paying their shareholders significant proportions of their profits every year, he said. Value destruction risks Yet this school of thinking has been critiqued by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, investors living in earlier times considered to be the fathers of value investing. In their seminal work Security Analysis, they wrote that the policy of withholding dividends for the sake of future growth is questionable. When a management withholds and reinvests profits, thus building up an accumulated surplus, it claims confidently to be acting for the best interests of the shareholders, they said. But in words that will resonate among Singapore's dividend-chasing retirees, they wrote: "The typical investor would most certainly prefer to have his dividend today and let tomorrow take care of itself. "No instances are on record in which the withholding of dividends for the sake of future profits has been hailed with such enthusiasm as to advance the price of the stock." Given two identical companies with similar earning potential, the one paying a larger dividend will always sell for more, he argued. Mr Graham and Mr Dodd, ever conservative, highlighted a major flaw of giving companies too much power. Managers can destroy significant shareholder value through ill-timed corporate acquisitions. Just ask shareholders of big international banks which over-expanded before the global financial crisis and had to be bailed out by the state after. A famous example of a corporate disaster is the merger of media giants America Online (AOL) and Time Warner at the height of the dotcom bubble in 2000. For the 2002 financial year, the combined group reported a staggering net loss of almost US$100 billion, mostly due to writing down the value of AOL. Mr Graham and Mr Dodd strongly argued for a dividend policy as a check and balance on the powers behind a corporation. Boards of directors typically consist of executive officers and their friends, he said. "The officers are naturally desirous of retaining as much cash as possible in the treasury, in order to simplify their financial problems; they are also inclined to expand the business persistently for the sake of personal aggrandisement and to secure higher salaries." Boards are already too powerful. Large, dominant stockholders who are already receiving large salaries, don't like the taxes that dividends will attract. "In such cases they are perfectly willing to leave their share of the earnings in the corporate treasury, since the latter is under their control and since by so doing they retain control over the earnings accruing to the other stockholders as well," the authors said. As to how much companies should retain as earnings, they later said they were against companies that retain 70 per cent and only pay out 30 per cent as dividends, compared to the other way round. Sustainability of cash flows Who is right? Mr Lynch, who dismisses heavy dividend payers as slow-growing firms, or Mr Graham and Mr Dodd, who avidly prefer birds in the hand? The answer depends more on the kind of industries which dividend-paying companies operate in, and the kinds of cash flows they have. In a slow-growth environment like what we are going through now, dominant companies in defensive consumer businesses can do very well. They don't really need to borrow, except to fine-tune their corporate structure. They have tremendous cash flows from which they can pay ample amounts of dividends every year - Unilever and Nestle come to mind - and investors are willing to pay multiples of 20 times or more for their consistent earnings growth. In this scenario, high dividend payers might be highly valued, especially when interest rates are low. Given the defensive nature of their businesses, it pays for an investor to be exposed to them. By contrast, one might look more askance at high dividend payers in cyclical industries such as oil and gas services. Investors once looked up to local property and oil-rig conglomerate Keppel Corporation as a dividend-paying machine. Look up its dividend history online and you can see a track record of mostly increasing payouts all the way since 1989. However, the oil price crash put paid to notions that Keppel is a dividend stock. Payouts in absolute terms have more than halved from the heady high oil price days of 2011-2014. What happened? Keppel's customers were not able to pay it back for the rigs they have commissioned. Cash was supposed to come in upon delivery. But deliveries had to be delayed or cancelled. So cash flows dropped. Meanwhile, new orders plunged. As future cash flows looked shaky, the company can no longer afford to pay as much dividends as before. Nevertheless, Keppel investors who have stuck with the company through thick and thin would have little to complain about. Over the past 20 years, where the company has seen a couple of cycles, Keppel has paid easily S$6 per share of dividends. Should one have argued for Keppel's managers to do what insurance companies do, and "smooth" out the dividends? This means, retaining profits in good times so that shareholders have a smoothly increasing dividend payment in bad times, that the company can then brag about? I think not. Generally speaking, from the perspective of a shareholder, dividends are a good idea, provided the company pays them out of reasonably strong cash flows. For the regular man on the street, dividends provide a welcome flow of income. For the company, the act of paying dividends arguably encourages a long-term horizon for managers, and prudence in investing. By contrast, so what if a company retains all its earnings for the sake of growth and becomes a multi-bagger within a few years, but fails spectacularly after? Or worse, it tries another method of rewarding shareholders, repurchasing its shares while prices are sky-high, but miscalculates? The business world is uncertain. A new, deadly competitor could enter the industry. The environment could change permanently. Executives can get overconfident. Fraud can occur if executives are under pressure to deliver. Your multi-bagger can still end up as a penny stock if you weren't smart enough to sell it when it was overvalued. But if you have some dividends from all those years, you wouldn't have lost everything. So keep it up, AGM "I want-more-dividends" uncle! You are doing just fine.

Laman Public Library System are asking people to donate plastic bags and help it turn them into mats for people who are homeless. The program is more of a reuse, rather than recycling, program, putting to use the plastic bags that aren't as easy to recycle as other materials. It's also a part of the library's new programming that debuted this month. Staff members were looking for new programming ideas, and adult programming director Carol Kirkpatrick found mats made out of plastic bags while searching the Internet. Other libraries had been doing it, too. Kirkpatrick wanted to do a community service project, like previous programs that provided Christmas cards for military veterans and accepted food donations for the hungry in lieu of fines. The mats provide a cushion for people who may not have a soft surface to sleep on. Plus, they are lightweight and don't get bugs in them, she said. "I just thought that they were just such a good idea," Kirkpatrick said. So about a month ago, the library began asking for people's plastic bags. Staff set up a crochet table on the first floor of the main library last week. "It gets the community together," said Richard Theilig, associate director of the special projects for the library. He noted the turnout for the first crochet event March 18 in which 54 volunteers crocheted mats. Waste Management doesn't accept plastic bags in its recycling bins or at its recycling facility. Some retail outlets, such as Kroger, Wal-Mart and Target, have recycling bins at their stores in which people can deposit plastic bags. [EMAIL UPDATES: Get free breaking news alerts, daily newsletters with top headlines delivered to your inbox] The library still doesn't accept every plastic bag. Produce bags from grocery stores or sandwich bags from Subway are too thin and tear too easily to turn into plastic yarn. The latest data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, from 2015, count more than 800 people who are homeless in central Arkansas. In 2013, volunteers for the agency counted more than 1,000 people who were homeless. Experts speculated that the difference in totals could be a real drop in the number of people who are homeless in the area, or it could have something to do with the weather on the days in which the counts were made. The Van, a local nonprofit that aids people who are homeless, received several dozen plastic bag mats to distribute a few years ago, said Aaron Reddin, The Van founder and executive director. Reddin didn't remember who had sent them. Not everyone wanted to take a mat, he said, although they were more popular with people who sleep on concrete surfaces than with people who sleep in homeless camps. But often, he said, people didn't carry around the mats forever. "I think a lot of the problem with them before is that they would get left all over the place and they would become litter," Reddin said. The mats aren't easily mass produced. Each mat requires about 500 to 700 plastic bags and hours of manpower to make. Making one mat might take two months for a person inexperienced in crochet, said Shelbie Reed, a library assistant. Volunteers last Saturday produced two mats -- blue, red, yellow, green and white woven together -- in their afternoon of work. Library staff want to have more events like Saturday's, and they hope to attract more volunteers on other days. Anyone who'd like to can go to a table on the first floor of the library and crochet from a basketball-sized ball of plastic yarn -- called "plarn" -- or cut bags into plarn for as long as they want. Library staff have recently asked North Little Rock High School students who go to the library after school to pitch in. Some have helped. Theilig said he'd like to produce two new mats each week, but he and library assistant Cory McEwen noted the number produced will depend on the number of volunteers and the number of plastic bags donated. "If it turns out to only be one a month, that's better than nothing," Theilig said.

(OTCQB: TALN), a leading global supplier of zippers, apparel fasteners, trim and stretch technology products, reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Full Year Financial Highlights Revenues were flat for 2016 versus the prior year as Trim sales continued to increase while Zipper sales declined Trim revenues posted a 13% increase versus the prior year Overall gross profit increased 8.3%, or $1.3 million versus the prior year Gross margins improved to 36.5% in 2016 from 33.7% in 2015, due to a more favorable product mix and operational cost improvements Income from operations increased $1.3 million over the prior year Recent News Highlights Talon announced it is „Unzipping LA Fashion Week” (LAFW) with the world’s longest zipper installation. At 3.1 miles in length, Talon is slated to join the Guinness Book of World Records A Talon Zipper Exhibit was held March 23-26 featuring the rarest vintage Talon zippers in the market, some of the hottest new garments using Talon zippers, and the World Records Longest Zipper Financial Results Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $48.3 million, reflecting a slight decrease of $93,000 or -0.2% as compared to the same period in 2015. Talon Zipper product sales for the year were $3.7 million lower, or 17.4%, than the same period in 2015 due to decreased sales within the mass market retailers and specialty retailers as compared to 2015. Talon Trim revenues, which consist primarily of sales to specialty retail branded customers, increased by $3.6 million, or 13.3%, compared to the same period in 2015, mainly due to new stretch technology programs and customers. Revenues for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016 were $11.7 million, down less than 1% from the same period in 2015. Fourth quarter 2016 included $3.7 million in Zipper revenues, up $0.3 million from the prior year, and $8.0 million in Trim revenues, a decrease of $0.4 million versus the same period in 2015. „We continued to make progress on our strategic initiatives in 2016,” stated Larry Dyne, Talon’s Chief Executive Officer. „Though our revenues were flat versus the prior year, we produced higher margins and improved income from operations, as we had a more favorable product mix and worked to improve our operational costs. To remain focused on serving our customers, we’ve expanded geographically in order to locate near their manufacturing facilities, and are working closely with our specialty brand retail customers to offer Fit for Purpose items that meet our innovation and profitability standards. We continue to make significant investments in our product segments, particularly in the Trim business, as we experienced revenue growth and momentum this year.” Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $17.6 million, or 36.5% of sales, compared to $16.3 million, or 33.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $1.3 million. Gross profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 was $4.2 million, or 36.0%, compared to $4.3 million, or 36.6%, in the fourth quarter of 2015. The gross profit increase for the year is attributable to lower direct purchase costs and a shift into a greater revenue mix of higher-margin products.

Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $3.8 million, which was $85,000 higher than the fourth quarter of 2015. Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $6.8 million, a $371,000 increase when compared to the same period in 2015.

The retail trade group expects consumers to dole out $18.4 billion in connection with the Easter holiday on April 16. Spending is expected to be 6% more than last year, setting another record for the Spring holiday. NRF expects the average consumer will spend $152 per person, up 4% from the $146 they spend a year ago. “Most consumers have almost an entire extra month to shop for Easter this year, and by the time the holiday comes the weather should be significantly warmer than last Easter,” NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said. “That should put shoppers in the frame of mind to splurge on spring apparel along with Easter decorations. With the economy improving, consumers are ready to shop and retailers are ready to offer great deals whether they’re buying Easter baskets or garden tools.” The biggest expenditure will be on food as 87% of consumers surveyed said they will splurge on an Easter meal. Food spending is expected to top $5.8 billion. Apparel retailers are also expected to be big winners with 50% of consumers buying new clothes for a total expected spend of $3.3 billion, up 9% from a year ago and the highest level in a decade. More than half (61%) of consumers said they will buy Easter gifts ranging from stuffed rabbits to festive baskets and live bunnies. Gift spending is expected to reach $2.9 billion this year. Candy is another big purchase for shoppers at Easter with 89% of consumers planning to spend a total $2.6 billion on sugary confections. Other large expenditures for consumers this Easter include $1.2 billion spent on flowers and $1.1 billion on holiday decorations by 43% of consumers surveyed. Consumers were asked where and how they plan to do their Easter shopping this year and 58% said they will head to discount stores such as Walmart, or off-price clothiers like TJ Maxx and Ross Stores. Department stores are also expected to see a fair number of shoppers with 46% saying they will shop traditional department store chains like J.C. Penney, Dillard’s and Belk. About one in four shoppers plans to spend part of the holiday budget with local small businesses and 27% plan to shop online, compared to 21% a year ago. “Easter continues to be a traditional holiday for consumers of all ages, especially young families who are planning to spend a bit more for this celebration,” Prosper Principal Analyst Pam Goodfellow said. “With the later timing of Easter, we will see more consumers shopping for special deals, especially on apparel and decorations.” Comments comments Previous post Fort Smith businessman seeks marijuana cultivation center, working to figure out a new industry Next post Federal suit filed to block eight executions in Arkansas set for April Talk Business & Politics by email Arkansas headlines delivered to you on demand Email address Statewide Newsletter Northeast Arkansas Newsletter Fort Smith Newsletter Northwest Arkansas Newsletter Submit Advertisement Search Talk Business & Politics Search for: Opinion Gov.

(OTCQB: TALN), a leading global supplier of zippers, apparel fasteners, trim and stretch technology products, reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Full Year Financial Highlights Revenues were flat for 2016 versus the prior year as Trim sales continued to increase while Zipper sales declined Trim revenues posted a 13% increase versus the prior year Overall gross profit increased 8.3%, or $1.3 million versus the prior year Gross margins improved to 36.5% in 2016 from 33.7% in 2015, due to a more favorable product mix and operational cost improvements Income from operations increased $1.3 million over the prior year Recent News Highlights Talon announced it is "Unzipping LA Fashion Week" (LAFW) with the world's longest zipper installation. At 3.1 miles in length, Talon is slated to join the Guinness Book of World Records A Talon Zipper Exhibit was held March 23-26 featuring the rarest vintage Talon zippers in the market, some of the hottest new garments using Talon zippers, and the World Records Longest Zipper Financial Results Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $48.3 million, reflecting a slight decrease of $93,000 or -0.2% as compared to the same period in 2015. Talon Zipper product sales for the year were $3.7 million lower, or 17.4%, than the same period in 2015 due to decreased sales within the mass market retailers and specialty retailers as compared to 2015. Talon Trim revenues, which consist primarily of sales to specialty retail branded customers, increased by $3.6 million, or 13.3%, compared to the same period in 2015, mainly due to new stretch technology programs and customers. Revenues for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016 were $11.7 million, down less than 1% from the same period in 2015. Fourth quarter 2016 included $3.7 million in Zipper revenues, up $0.3 million from the prior year, and $8.0 million in Trim revenues, a decrease of $0.4 million versus the same period in 2015. "We continued to make progress on our strategic initiatives in 2016," stated Larry Dyne, Talon's Chief Executive Officer. "Though our revenues were flat versus the prior year, we produced higher margins and improved income from operations, as we had a more favorable product mix and worked to improve our operational costs. To remain focused on serving our customers, we've expanded geographically in order to locate near their manufacturing facilities, and are working closely with our specialty brand retail customers to offer Fit for Purpose items that meet our innovation and profitability standards. We continue to make significant investments in our product segments, particularly in the Trim business, as we experienced revenue growth and momentum this year." Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $17.6 million, or 36.5% of sales, compared to $16.3 million, or 33.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $1.3 million. Gross profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 was $4.2 million, or 36.0%, compared to $4.3 million, or 36.6%, in the fourth quarter of 2015. The gross profit increase for the year is attributable to lower direct purchase costs and a shift into a greater revenue mix of higher-margin products. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were essentially flat from the prior year at $14.9 million. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $3.8 million, which was $85,000 higher than the fourth quarter of 2015. Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $6.8 million, a $371,000 increase when compared to the same period in 2015. This was mainly due to additional compensation costs, increased facilities and related expenses, and an increase in new product development and marketing costs, offset by a decrease in travel and related costs. Sales and marketing expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 were $1.8 million, as compared to $1.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2015.

Reports 2016 Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Financial Results By Published: Mar 27, 2017 6:53 p.m. ET Share LOS ANGELES, CA, Mar 27, 2017 (Marketwired via COMTEX) -- LOS ANGELES, CA--(Marketwired - Mar 27, 2017) - Talon International, Inc. (otcqb:TALN), a leading global supplier of zippers, apparel fasteners, trim and stretch technology products, reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Full Year Financial Highlights Revenues were flat for 2016 versus the prior year as Trim sales continued to increase while Zipper sales declined Trim revenues posted a 13% increase versus the prior year Overall gross profit increased 8.3%, or $1.3 million versus the prior year Gross margins improved to 36.5% in 2016 from 33.7% in 2015, due to a more favorable product mix and operational cost improvements Income from operations increased $1.3 million over the prior year Recent News Highlights Talon announced it is "Unzipping LA Fashion Week" (LAFW) with the world's longest zipper installation. At 3.1 miles in length, Talon is slated to join the Guinness Book of World Records A Talon Zipper Exhibit was held March 23-26 featuring the rarest vintage Talon zippers in the market, some of the hottest new garments using Talon zippers, and the World Records Longest Zipper Financial Results Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $48.3 million, reflecting a slight decrease of $93,000 or -0.2% as compared to the same period in 2015. Talon Zipper product sales for the year were $3.7 million lower, or 17.4%, than the same period in 2015 due to decreased sales within the mass market retailers and specialty retailers as compared to 2015. Talon Trim revenues, which consist primarily of sales to specialty retail branded customers, increased by $3.6 million, or 13.3%, compared to the same period in 2015, mainly due to new stretch technology programs and customers. Revenues for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016 were $11.7 million, down less than 1% from the same period in 2015. Fourth quarter 2016 included $3.7 million in Zipper revenues, up $0.3 million from the prior year, and $8.0 million in Trim revenues, a decrease of $0.4 million versus the same period in 2015. "We continued to make progress on our strategic initiatives in 2016," stated Larry Dyne, Talon's Chief Executive Officer. "Though our revenues were flat versus the prior year, we produced higher margins and improved income from operations, as we had a more favorable product mix and worked to improve our operational costs. To remain focused on serving our customers, we've expanded geographically in order to locate near their manufacturing facilities, and are working closely with our specialty brand retail customers to offer Fit for Purpose items that meet our innovation and profitability standards. We continue to make significant investments in our product segments, particularly in the Trim business, as we experienced revenue growth and momentum this year." Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $17.6 million, or 36.5% of sales, compared to $16.3 million, or 33.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $1.3 million. Gross profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 was $4.2 million, or 36.0%, compared to $4.3 million, or 36.6%, in the fourth quarter of 2015. The gross profit increase for the year is attributable to lower direct purchase costs and a shift into a greater revenue mix of higher-margin products. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were essentially flat from the prior year at $14.9 million. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $3.8 million, which was $85,000 higher than the fourth quarter of 2015. Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $6.8 million, a $371,000 increase when compared to the same period in 2015. This was mainly due to additional compensation costs, increased facilities and related expenses, and an increase in new product development and marketing costs, offset by a decrease in travel and related costs. Sales and marketing expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 were $1.8 million, as compared to $1.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $2.1 million compared to $773,000 for the same period in 2015. For the quarter ended December 31, 2016, operations reflected income before income taxes of $289,000 as compared to income before income taxes of $445,000 for the same quarter in 2015. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1.0 million or $0.01 per share as compared to $511,000 or $0.01 per share for the year ended December 31, 2015.

(OTCQB: TALN), a leading global supplier of zippers, apparel fasteners, trim and stretch technology products, reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Full Year Financial Highlights Revenues were flat for 2016 versus the prior year as Trim sales continued to increase while Zipper sales declined Trim revenues posted a 13% increase versus the prior year Overall gross profit increased 8.3%, or $1.3 million versus the prior year Gross margins improved to 36.5% in 2016 from 33.7% in 2015, due to a more favorable product mix and operational cost improvements Income from operations increased $1.3 million over the prior year Recent News Highlights Talon announced it is "Unzipping LA Fashion Week" (LAFW) with the world's longest zipper installation. At 3.1 miles in length, Talon is slated to join the Guinness Book of World Records A Talon Zipper Exhibit was held March 23-26 featuring the rarest vintage Talon zippers in the market, some of the hottest new garments using Talon zippers, and the World Records Longest Zipper Financial Results Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $48.3 million, reflecting a slight decrease of $93,000 or -0.2% as compared to the same period in 2015. Talon Zipper product sales for the year were $3.7 million lower, or 17.4%, than the same period in 2015 due to decreased sales within the mass market retailers and specialty retailers as compared to 2015. Talon Trim revenues, which consist primarily of sales to specialty retail branded customers, increased by $3.6 million, or 13.3%, compared to the same period in 2015, mainly due to new stretch technology programs and customers. Revenues for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016 were $11.7 million, down less than 1% from the same period in 2015. Fourth quarter 2016 included $3.7 million in Zipper revenues, up $0.3 million from the prior year, and $8.0 million in Trim revenues, a decrease of $0.4 million versus the same period in 2015. "We continued to make progress on our strategic initiatives in 2016," stated Larry Dyne, Talon's Chief Executive Officer. "Though our revenues were flat versus the prior year, we produced higher margins and improved income from operations, as we had a more favorable product mix and worked to improve our operational costs. To remain focused on serving our customers, we've expanded geographically in order to locate near their manufacturing facilities, and are working closely with our specialty brand retail customers to offer Fit for Purpose items that meet our innovation and profitability standards. We continue to make significant investments in our product segments, particularly in the Trim business, as we experienced revenue growth and momentum this year." Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $17.6 million, or 36.5% of sales, compared to $16.3 million, or 33.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $1.3 million. Gross profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 was $4.2 million, or 36.0%, compared to $4.3 million, or 36.6%, in the fourth quarter of 2015. The gross profit increase for the year is attributable to lower direct purchase costs and a shift into a greater revenue mix of higher-margin products. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were essentially flat from the prior year at $14.9 million. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $3.8 million, which was $85,000 higher than the fourth quarter of 2015. Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $6.8 million, a $371,000 increase when compared to the same period in 2015. This was mainly due to additional compensation costs, increased facilities and related expenses, and an increase in new product development and marketing costs, offset by a decrease in travel and related costs. Sales and marketing expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 were $1.8 million, as compared to $1.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2015.

The company announced a joint venture with Ball Equipment, based in Sandusky, to boost e-commerce by selling more parts online. (Photo: Weingartz) 235 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE To boost their e-commerce businesses and in anticipation of future opportunities, two Michigan companies and former rivals — Weingartz Supply and Ball Equipment — are joining forces to form a new online venture that will sell parts for outdoor power equipment and smaller recreational vehicles, such as four-wheelers and snowmobiles. The new company, BW Retail Solutions, will run the e-commerce operations and websites for the two family-owned retailers. "It's a combining of resources," Dan Weingartz, president of the Utica-based business, said today "Ball Equipment is a company that has done really well in e-commerce. They have been growing incredibly fast. They are six times larger than they were six years ago, and really could use our infrastructure help, access to capital and access to a company that's been there from a growth perspective." Related: Michigan startup aims to feed time-starved folks Entrepreneur cooks up plan to change way you eat Initially, he said, Weingartz — a chain of five stores that sell outdoor power equipment — sought to buy Ball Equipment outright. "But, they didn't want to sell," Weingartz said. "Their company is growing like crazy. They are doing exceptionally well." Under the complex agreement that the two privately held companies came to after nearly a year of negotiations, they will consolidate marketing and online fulfillment operations in a 45,000-square-foot warehouse in Chesterfield. The warehouse is a former manufacturing facility that Weingartz purchased. The joint venture will manage marketing, fulfillment and customer service for both organizations’ e-commerce businesses. Chris Ball, vice-president of Ball Equipment, was named CEO of the venture, and Weingartz purchased a minority stake in Ball. “We could not have asked for a better opportunity or partner,” Ball said. “We know that as retail environments change, we have to continue to innovate, diversify and stand together with like-minded partners in order to be successful. This joint venture begins a new chapter in the long history of both family-owned companies.” The venture is expected to hire 6-10 additional workers immediately, and more as the venture expands. For Weingartz, the deal is an e-commerce play that gives it expertise in an area that it sees as essential to the future of the company — and the retail industry in general. Now, only about 5% of Weingartz's sales comes from e-commerce, but, Weingartz said, it is the fastest-growing part of the business. E-commerce for Ball's is more than 40%. About 95% of the e-commerce business for both companies is from parts and accessories sales. Many companies in the last few years — especially department stores — have been scrambling to hold on to their customers and purchase specialty retailers that have robust online sales as customers reach for their keyboards and phones to shop, rather than get in their cars and head to the mall. Walmart, for example, is paying $51 million for Moosejaw — a Madison Heights-based company that specializes in outdoor recreation apparel and gear and is known for its quirky, cutting-edge marketing — as a part of multiple acquisitions in hopes of strengthening the global retail juggernaut's online offerings. BW Retail Solutions, Weingartz said, helps positions the two companies — which had been friendly competitors — to work together to pick up substantially more business from Sears, which also is in the power tools parts business, as the national retailer struggles to stay in business after years of losses and declining sales. Last week, Sears Holdings warned it may fail as a going concern. Weingartz said the company doesn't view e-commerce as a replacement for brick-and-mortar stores. The company was started by Weingartz' grandfather in 1945 as a feed and farm supply store in a sparsely populated part of Macomb County. His father turned the business into a power equipment superstore. Ball Equipment, like Weingartz, also started in the 1940s. It is based in Sandusky, in the Thumb, and has a store in Richmond. In addition to lawn mowers, snow blowers, and other power tools, it also sells power sports equipment — including all-terrain vehicles and snowmobiles. "We think that brick and mortar is our identity and will always — or at least for the foreseeable future — be the driver of our business," Weingartz said. "But, people want that complementariness. They want that ability to shop online, and have that global reach — especially for things like parts." Moreover, he added, a more robust online business allows the company to sell to customers all over the country. Contact Frank Witsil: 313-222-5022 or fwitsil@freepress.com.

After years of complaints about retail staff who routinely follow, search, ignore, insult and provide poor service to visible minorities, one province has decided to do something about it in a big way. On Monday, the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission launched a free, online training program aimed at preventing a problem that has sparked a growing chorus of complaints across the country. The 20-minute interactive course for front-line service staff — described as the first of its kind in Canada — has already attracted attention from businesses in other provinces and the United States, and plans are in the works to roll out a national campaign. Lennett Anderson, senior pastor at Emmanuel Baptist Church, speaks as Justice Minister Diana Whalen, and Christine Hanson, CEO of the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission, look on in Dartmouth, N.S. on Monday. "As a proud African Nova Scotian and seventh-generation Canadian ... I am acutely aware of the problems associated with navigating race relations in our society,'' Rev. Lennett Anderson of the African United Baptist Association of Nova Scotia told a news conference at the Halifax Chamber of Commerce. "The need for a campaign such as this is a desperate one ... It is worthy of our celebration.'' The retail sector is Canada's largest employer, with over two million people working in an industry that generated $59 billion in payroll in 2015. "The need for a campaign such as this is a desperate one ... '' — Rev. Lennett Anderson Christine Hanson, CEO of the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission, said the need for such a training program was reinforced in 2013 when the commission released a groundbreaking report that concluded aboriginal people and African Canadians more often reported being treated poorly by retail staff than did any other group. "In fact, people from all racialized groups, including Asian, Latin American and Middle Eastern people, reported being treated poorly by staff far more than did white people,'' the report said. "In the focus groups, several participants commented on being made to feel 'lower class' or like 'second-class citizens' when shopping.'' Christine Hanson, CEO of the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission, announces an online training course dealing with consumer racial profiling to educate retail businesses, in Dartmouth, N.S. on Monday. The report went on to say that aboriginal people, African Canadians, and Muslims were all targets of offensive language and were treated as if they were physically threatening and potential thieves. "A person who is a member of a visible minority group is three times more likely to be followed in a store, and four times more likely to be searched,'' Hanson said. The online program, called "Serving All Customers Better,'' includes a quiz about immigration and visible minorities. It also cites statistics from the 2013 report and clearly spells out what the law says. The course also cites some examples, at one point quoting a worker who said: "I worked for a retailer who said, 'The eagle has landed,' when a black person walked into the store. I quit my job over it.'' Examples of consumer racial profiling continue to make headlines across the country. In October 2015, the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario agreed with a woman who said she faced discrimination as a black person when she was confronted by a Shoppers Drug Mart employee who demanded to search her backpack on suspicion of shoplifting. The tribunal ordered the store to pay Mary McCarthy $8,000. And in February 2015, Calgary university student Jean Ventose said he was racially profiled when he was followed by a security guard inside a local Walmart, apparently for no reason. He posted a video on the encounter on Facebook, which received more than one million views and 10,000 reactions in two days. In August 2016, one of Canada's largest grocery chains withdrew its appeal of a human rights decision that found an employee of Sobeys had discriminated against a black customer in May 2009 after falsely accusing her of being a repeat shoplifter. Sobeys said it reached a settlement with the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission and would apologize to Andrella David, pay her $21,000 in compensation, and develop a staff training program on racial profiling. The company faced a boycott by a group of 19 churches in the province. As well, Nova Scotia's first black lieutenant-governor, Mayann Francis, came forward to reveal that she, too, had been the victim of repeated racial profiling while shopping. At the time, Francis said Nova Scotia was in a state of denial when it came to racial profiling, saying she had often been the victim of "shopping while black'' since she left her viceregal post in 2012. "It does not matter how successful you are, it still can happen to you,'' said Francis, who had previously served as CEO of the province's human rights commission. Former lieutenant-governor of Nova Scotia, Mayann Francis, says she has experienced racial profiling while shopping. "It's just so wrong and so hurtful and I know how I feel when I'm followed in the stores ... They're stalking you.'' Earlier in the year, the Hudson's Bay Company agreed to educate its staff about racial profiling as part of a settlement in the case of a now-deceased Nova Scotia grandmother allegedly accused of shoplifting a rug from a Zellers outlet in 2008. "It's just so wrong and so hurtful and I know how I feel when I'm followed in the stores ... They're stalking you.'' — Mayann Francis, First black lieutenant-governor of Nova Scotia Anderson, the pastor at Emmanuel Baptist Church in Hammonds Plains, N.S., said the new online course in Nova Scotia marks a big step forward for visible minorities. "Today, we are engaging in a courageous conversation,'' he said. "We have decided that it's time to confront major issues in our society ... Race is not a card we play, it's a life we live ... This campaign is not about behaviour modification, it's about a societal transformation.''Also On HuffPost: Close  Racist Moments of   During an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Winfrey was asked if she had personally experienced racism. She responded with an anecdote about a clerk at a shop in Switzerland who had recently refused to show her an expensive bag, even though she repeated her request multiple times. "That one will cost too much, you won't be able to afford that," Winfrey claimed the clerk told her. Read the full story, here. The 66-year-old chef and Food Network star admitted in a deposition in a discrimination lawsuit that she used racial slurs in the past. Deen was asked under oath if she had ever used the N-word. "Yes, of course," Deen said, though she added, "It's been a very long time." Yes, racist tweets will get you in trouble. AJC posted this, deleted it, and had to apologize. Michael Dunn, the Florida man charged with shooting 17-year-old Jordan Davis after an argument over loud music, is currently awaiting trial and maintaining that he acted in self-defense the night of the fatal confrontation. In several letters reportedly written from jail, and obtained by News4Jax, Dunn rants about killing "thugs" so "they take the hint and change their behavior," black-on-white crime and the liberal media. Barneys New York and the New York Police Department have been slapped with a lawsuit by Trayon Christian, a college student from Queens, who was arrested at the luxury department store in April. "His only crime was being a young black man,” Michael Palillo, Christian's attorney, told The New York Post. The Post reports that the 19-year-old was at the store buying a $350 Salvatore Ferragamo belt, but following the purchase, he was stopped by undercover officers that were allegedly called on by a Barneys sales clerk who believed the transaction was fraudulent. A young Australian woman hosted an "African" themed 21st birthday party. Afterwards, she shared photos that show attendees In blackface and KKK costumes. A black woman was allegedly fired from her job because of her blonde highlights. Farryn Johnson told Maryland's CBS News affiliate that she was let go from her job as a waitress at Hooters due to '"improper image" after the 25-year-old refused to remove blonde highlights from her dark brown hair. "They specifically said, 'Black women don't have blonde in their hair, so you need to take it out,'" Johnson told CBS. An Ohio charter school attempted to ban "afro-puffs and small twisted braids." WANE-TV shared an image of the billboard, which is said to flash with the words "Impeach Obama." Kayla Phillips, a 21-year-old nursing student from Brooklyn, told the Daily News that she was stopped by police after purchasing a $2,500 Céline bag at the store on February 28. After buying the luxury item with the money from a tax return, the woman left the Madison Avenue store. Three blocks away, she says she was surrounded by four undercover police officers -- two white, one African American and one Asian -- at a nearby subway station. Ashley Davis, a 24-year-old from St. Peters, Mo., said a change in her company's policy now requires her to cut off her dreadlocks. “I've only been there for two months, and they came up with a policy. I feel like it's degrading,” she said. The New York Post reports that actor Robert Brown, who's most known for his starring role opposite Sean Connery in the film “Finding Forrester," has filled a civil suit for an unspecified sum against the luxury retail store and the New York Police Department, citing that he was unlawfully searched by undercover police officers on June 8, 2013. The 29 year old, who is black, was stopped after making a purchase at the Sunglass Hut store located inside Macy's flagship location in New York's Herald Square A group costume features a man dressed as Martin, wearing blackface and a blood-stained hoodie, and a man portraying Zimmerman, wearing a shirt that reads "Neighborhood Watch." In a photo uploaded to the Facebook account of Caitlin Cimeno, the woman in the picture, the man portraying Zimmerman has fashioned a gun out of his right hand and has pointed it at the man dressed as Martin. An Arkansas town with a reportedly dark past rooted in racial discrimination is pushing back after an "anti-racist" billboard went up on a major roadway there last month. Someone in Harrison, Ark., is paying $200 a month for an entire year to display this 12-by-24–foot sign with the message "Anti-Racist is a Code Word for Anti-White."  Share  Tweet  ✖ Advertisement Share this ✖ close Current Slide Also on HuffPost: More: business video canada-whats-working video racism racial profiling Shopping While Black canada retail canada racism Nova Scotia Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission nova-scotia-racial-profiling mayann-francis Suggest a correction   Click here to view Conversations Conversations Suggested For You FOLLOW HUFFPOST Email Email Address Please check the checkbox to indicate your consent Options HuffPost Daily Brief Business Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..

Police in Isabella County have released a photo of a possible suspect in the investigation into pornographic material being left on vehicle windshields in Isabella County. The investigation began last Thursday afternoon when a woman reported that someone had left a DVD on a woman’s car at the Target store on the south end of Mt Pleasant. Deputies watched security footage and say it showed this silver SUV pulling up next to victim’s vehicle. Since the first report, the sheriff’s office says several other victims have come forward and they are currently investigating ten events from within Isabella County and two outside the county. The victims all report a similar experience of pornographic material being left on their vehicle while inside a retail store. Most had a similar drawing with left with the material. On Friday another incident happened at the Walmart store in Mt Pleasant and during that investigation deputies were able to still photos of a possible suspect. The sheriff’s office is asking for your help in identifying the man seen in these photos.  He is considered a person of interest in the case. Deputies also have a photo of a possible vehicle driven by the man. Anyone with information is asked to contact the Isabella County Sheriff’s Office [at 989.772.5911]. 7-Day Forecast Around our Area Volleyball Team Uses Dodgeball for Fundraiser Lampwork Glass Artist Looks to Share Talent Live From Charlevoix Walking for a Cause Shared Skies In Traverse City Joining Forces for a Cause State News Michigan High School Graduation Rates Very Similar to Previous Year MDOT Lifts Spring Weight Restrictions from US-10 South to State Border AMBER ALERT UPDATE – CHILDREN WHO WERE IN BACKSEAT OF STOLEN CAR FOUND SAFE IN FLINT New Law Allows State Regulation of Ridesharing Businesses such as Uber and Lyft DNR Releases 2016 Forest Health Highlights Report Child Lead Exposure Elimination Commission now Permanent, Manistee County Resident one of 15 Members World News RECALL – OK Food Recalls over 900,000lbs of Breaded Chicken that could have Metal Pieces Inside RECALL – Canadian Company Recalls Pig Ears over Salmonella Concerns J.C.

The General Administration and Elections Committee approved, along party lines, a bill that would cap the amount of money these independent expenditure committees can receive, bar foreign influenced entities from contributing or making any expenditures, and increase disclosure of those contributing. House Speaker Joe Aresimowicz, D-Berlin, lent the bill his support at a press conference Monday morning. Under the legislation, the amount an outside group would be able to contribute to an independent expenditure group would be capped at $70,000 annually. However, the independent expenditure groups would still be able to make unlimited contributions to clean election candidates, House Majority Leader Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said. Given past Supreme Court decisions, it’s possible a cap on contributions to independent expenditure groups could face legal challenges. Aresimowicz said the language in the bill may be ripe for court challenges, but they believe the court got it wrong in a couple cases dealing with campaign spending and corporations. “If some of the individual aspects of this bill are challenged in court we’re all for it,” Aresimowicz said. “We’re going to pass the strongest bill that we think is necessary to protect our elections and our citizens here in the state of Connecticut.” Aresimowicz’s legal counsel, James Spallone, said $70,000 was what they felt would be “defensible” if it was challenged in court. In 2016, independent expenditure groups spent more than $1.4 million on more than a dozen General Assembly seats. The election resulted in Republicans picking up 8 seats in the House and drawing even with Democrats in the Senate. In late October, Aresimowicz decried independent expenditures made by a labor group on ads targeting Dr. William A. Petit Jr. At the time, Aresimowicz, who works for AFSCME Council 4, said he understands the Supreme Court decision makes those expenditures legal, but it causes the constituents in the district to lose their voice when large corporations and labor unions can say things that are inconsistent with what the constituents want. “We should not allow it,” Aresimowicz said. “Regardless of who is doing it.” However, the bill being proposed by Democratic leadership would not have changed anything about how that money was spent in most situations, including the objectionable and roundly criticized ad buy made by Labor United for Connecticut. The bill could change things for some independent expenditure groups, including the Democratic Governors Association and Republican Governors Association. In 2016, Grow Connecticut, a Republican-funded organization, spent $350,000 on a digital ad campaign and cable television ads targeting three Senate races and 10 House races. The largest donor to the organization was the Republican State Leadership Committee, which is a national 527 group that receives donations from thousands of donors, including Wal-Mart, Koch Industries, and Pfizer. A “527” group is an organization that can raise unlimited funds from individuals, corporations, or labor unions, but which must register with the IRS and disclose their contributions and expenditures. This legislation, if approved by the full General Assembly, would cap the amount of money the Republican State Leadership Committee could give to Grow Connecticut and it would require the group to disclose its top five donors. Liz Kurantowicz, founder of Grow Connecticut, said she will follow the law, whatever the law ends up being. At the same time, she said she’s not surprised the “Democrats want to limit free speech,” which is what she said this bill would do by limiting the amount of money outside groups could contribute. She said its amusing that Democrats want to limit some free speech, but not the so-called organizational spending their Political Action Committees, leadership committees, and party does on their behalf. She wondered what Democratic Gov. Dannel P. Malloy thinks about the legislation, since he hasn’t made a decision yet about whether to seek re-election and in 2014 the DGA spent millions of dollars on the race. Kelly Donnelly, a spokeswoman for Malloy, said they are reviewing the bill and will continue to follow as it progresses through the legislative session. In 2014, if the bill Democrats were touting Monday was in place, it would have required an Ohio nonprofit called A Public Voice Inc. to disclose its top five donors to Grow Connecticut. The group gave $1.17 million to Grow Connecticut to help pay for advertisements for Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom Foley. Under the bill being pitched by Democrats, the amount of money it could give would be capped at $70,000. Spallone said like the federal Disclose Act, the Connecticut bill tries to get at some of these “nesting dolls” and figure out who is behind some of these contributions. House Minority Leader Themis Klarides, R-Derby, said the Democratic approach to campaign finance disclosure ignores other organizations such as political action committees held by legislative leadership. “There should be greater disclosure throughout the campaign finance system,” Klarides said. “But the funneling of money raised right here at home into targeted races that have already received maximum contributions under the law is an obvious attempt to get around the intent of the reforms. In the lead up to the 2016 election, the so-called organizational expenditures Klarides complains about totaled about $712,000, which is less than the $1.4 million in independent expenditures and much less than the $11.4 million on clean election grants. “There’s work to be done on the bill to make sure that its new disclosure requirements fit seamlessly into the state’s existing disclosure regime, and Common Cause Connecticut looks forward to working with the bill’s sponsors to fine-tune and strengthen this important legislation,” Cheri Quickmire, executive director of Common Cause in Connecticut, said. Michael Brandi, executive director of the State Elections Enforcement Commission, said the bill aims to strengthen disclosure laws and “address the flow of money being spent on independent expenditures.” He said they support both of those goals and look forward to working on improving the bill.

The S&P 500 Index retreated more than 1 percent for the first time since October, and the small-cap Russell 2000 Index gave back more than 2 percent for the first time since September. As of Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down nine out of the past 10 days. Throwing a monkey wrench into the Trump rally was fresh uncertainty House Republicans could successfully repeal and replace Obamacare, one of their headline campaign promises for seven years now. Failure to do so, it’s believed, could seriously push back tax reform. And the promise of tax reform—along with deregulation and infrastructure spending—is arguably what’s driven the Trump rally. This uncertainty was confirmed Friday when President Donald Trump asked House Speaker Paul Ryan to pull the new health care bill from consideration—a stunning setback for the new president, who largely ran on his credentials as a master negotiator and closer. Trading the “Trump Slump” The thing is, the selloff was a huge overreaction. That’s the opinion of Marko Papic, geopolitical strategist with BCA Research, who visited our office last Thursday and briefed us on the investment implications of the domestic and European political climate. As always, Marko dazzled us with his deep intellect, quick wit and infectious enthusiasm. In his view, the market rally that immediately followed the election of President Donald Trump is still the “right” response. Among the companies that saw impressive returns were domestic, small-cap names, which have the most to gain (and less to lose) from Trump’s pledge to lower corporate taxes, slash regulations and raise tariffs. Small business optimism, meanwhile, posted its highest readings since 2004. click to enlarge Investors, according to Marko, are making too much of the Obamacare issue. Regardless of its failure to be repealed, tax reform is on its way. On Friday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reassured Americans that we could still expect “comprehensive” tax reform by August. It’s also worth recalling that, even though he failed to reform health care during his eight years in office, President Bill Clinton still managed to tackle tax reform with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. Increasing the likelihood that tax reform and infrastructure spending can be brought to light is, paradoxically, President Trump’s historically low approval rating. As you can see, he significantly trails the average rating of nine previous presidents during their same weeks in office. Congress’ job approval fares even worse at 28 percent, as of February. What this means is the sound of the clock ticking is deafening. Midterm elections are less than 20 months away, and Trump could very well be a one-term president. According to Marko, this gives Trump tremendous political capital among those who share his vision and urgently wish to pass legislation toward that end. Trump is seeking high growth now, not in 2020 or 2024, and I think it’s a mistake for investors to dismiss him,” Marko said, adding that the president’s goal of 4 percent GDP growth is more than attainable. But how? Get Ready for Inflation I’ve written about the inflationary implications of Trump’s more protectionist policies before. Over the past 30-plus years, free trade agreements (FTAs) such as NAFTA have certainly been easy on consumers’ pocketbooks. But the downside is that many U.S. companies have found it challenging, if not impossible, to compete with overseas companies whose operating expenses are a fraction of the cost, forcing them to shut down or move production out of the country. There’s disagreement among economists and policymakers about the extent of FTAs’ impact on jobs and wages here in the U.S., but the case can be made that they’ve been negative. Certainly this is the case Trump and his supporters made during his campaign. In the chart below, I compare U.S. wages as a percent of GDP between 1970 and 2013 and the KOF Globalization Index, which measures the economic, social and political dimensions of globalization on a scale from one to 100. The closer to 100, the more globalized a country is. As you can see, there’s at least a strong correlation between rising globalization and falling wages in the U.S. click to enlarge Trump’s director of the National Trade Council, Peter Navarro, argued in January that “there is no question” the U.S. needs a border adjustment tax (BAT) to bring jobs back and grow wages: “Would you rather have cheap subsidized… goods dumped into Walmart and not have a job and not have your wages go up in 15 years, or would you like to pay a little bit more—not much—a little bit more, and have a job and have your wages going up? I think the American people are going to make that choice.” Whether you agree with Trump and Navarro on this point, it’s important to recognize that inflation is poised to surge in the coming years. Consumer prices rose 2.7 percent year-over-year in February, the seventh straight month they’ve advanced. And if Trump manages to restrict immigration and raise trade barriers, we can expect prices to rise even more—along with manufacturing activity, wages and ultimately GDP growth. Bullish on Europe A final thought I want to share from Marko’s visit is his bullishness on Europe right now. “Forget about what you see in the news about Europe,” he said, “and look at the data.” He has a point. For one, the Markit Flash Eurozone PMI, released Friday, showed the region’s manufacturing activity growing at its fastest pace in six years. For the month of February, its PMI rose to 56.7. Terrorism remains a concern, as we saw in London last week, but the Syrian refugee crisis is emphatically done. Also overblown are Euroscepticism—or criticism of the European Union and its currency, the euro—secessionism and Trump-like populism. Geert Wilders’ far-right, anti-Muslim Party for Freedom (PVV) failed to secure an electoral victory in the Netherlands last week. Meanwhile, in France, the far-right Marie Le Pen still struggles to close the gap between herself and her two rivals, former prime minister of France François Fillon—currently being investigated on charges of corruption—and the socialist Emmanuel Macron. click to enlarge With only one month remaining before France’s presidential election, Le Pen trails both rivals by about 20 points, throwing her candidacy into doubt. At this point in the U.S. presidential election, Trump had proven himself a very competitive candidate, trailing the much more politically experienced Hillary Clinton by single digits. The key risk, according to Marko, is the upcoming Italian election, to be held no later than May 23. More and more, Italians are turning against the euro, and Euroscepticism is alarmingly high relative to other European Union countries. Whereas productivity is rising in Germany, France and Spain, Italy’s has stagnated since 2000. Whatever happens, it’s important to monitor the eurozone’s PMI because, as I’ve often pointed out, it’s a precursor to commodities demand.

After years of complaints about retail staff who routinely follow, search, ignore, insult and provide poor service to visible minorities, one province has decided to do something about it in a big way. On Monday, the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission launched a free, online training program aimed at preventing a problem that has sparked a growing chorus of complaints across the country. The 20-minute interactive course for front-line service staff — described as the first of its kind in Canada — has already attracted attention from businesses in other provinces and the United States, and plans are in the works to roll out a national campaign. "As a proud African Nova Scotian and seventh-generation Canadian ... I am acutely aware of the problems associated with navigating race relations in our society," Rev. Lennett Anderson of the African United Baptist Association of Nova Scotia told a news conference at the Halifax Chamber of Commerce. "The need for a campaign such as this is a desperate one ... It is worthy of our celebration." The retail sector is Canada's largest employer, with over two million people working in an industry that generated $59 billion in payroll in 2015. Christine Hanson, CEO of the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission, said the need for such a training program was reinforced in 2013 when the commission released a groundbreaking report that concluded aboriginal people and African Canadians more often reported being treated poorly by retail staff than did any other group. "In fact, people from all racialized groups, including Asian, Latin American and Middle Eastern people, reported being treated poorly by staff far more than did white people," the report said. "In the focus groups, several participants commented on being made to feel 'lower class' or like 'second-­class  citizens' when shopping." The report went on to say that aboriginal people, African Canadians, and Muslims were all targets of offensive language and were treated as if they were physically threatening and potential thieves. "A person who is a member of a visible minority group is three times more likely to be followed in a store, and four times more likely to be searched," Hanson said. The online program, called "Serving All Customers Better," includes a quiz about immigration and visible minorities. It also cites statistics from the 2013 report and clearly spells out what the law says. The course also cites some examples, at one point quoting a worker who said: "I worked for a retailer who said, 'The eagle has landed,' when a black person walked into the store … I quit my job over it." Examples of consumer racial profiling continue to make headlines across the country. In October 2015, the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario agreed with a woman who said she faced discrimination as a black person when she was confronted by a Shoppers Drug Mart employee who demanded to search her backpack on suspicion of shoplifting. The tribunal ordered the store to pay Mary McCarthy $8,000. And in February 2015, Calgary university student Jean Ventose said he was racially profiled when he was followed by a security guard inside a local Walmart, apparently for no reason. He posted a video on the encounter on Facebook, which received more than one million views and 10,000 reactions in two days. In August 2016, one of Canada's largest grocery chains withdrew its appeal of a human rights decision that found an employee of Sobeys had discriminated against a black customer in May 2009 after falsely accusing her of being a repeat shoplifter. Sobeys said it reached a settlement with the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission and would apologize to Andrella David, pay her $21,000 in compensation, and develop a staff training program on racial profiling. The company faced a boycott by a group of 19 churches in the province. As well, Nova Scotia's first black lieutenant-governor, Mayann Francis, came forward to reveal that she, too, had been the victim of repeated racial profiling while shopping. At the time, Francis said Nova Scotia was in a state of denial when it came to racial profiling, saying she had often been the victim of "shopping while black" since she left her viceregal post in 2012. "It does not matter how successful you are, it still can happen to you," said Francis, who had previously served as CEO of the province's human rights commission. "It's just so wrong and so hurtful and I know how I feel when I'm followed in the stores ... They're stalking you." Earlier in the year, the Hudson's Bay Company agreed to educate its staff about racial profiling as part of a settlement in the case of a now-deceased Nova Scotia grandmother allegedly accused of shoplifting a rug from a Zellers outlet in 2008. Anderson, the pastor at Emmanuel Baptist Church in Hammonds Plains, N.S., said the new online course in Nova Scotia marks a big step forward for visible minorities. "Today, we are engaging in a courageous conversation," he said. "We have decided that it's time to confront major issues in our society ... Race is not a card we play, it's a life we live ... This campaign is not about behaviour modification, it's about a societal transformation." --- On the web: www.servingall.ca.

Toggle navigation Celebrity Gossip Fashion Weddings Babies Hair Pets News Sports Politics TV Movies Cuba Gooding Jr. Lifts Sarah Paulson's Skirt, Gets Slammed For Sexual Harassment by Tyler Johnson at March 27, 2017 4:43 pm. Comments Sigh. Just when we thought Cuba Gooding Jr. was flawlessly executing one of the most surprising comebacks in recent memory, he goes and does something like this. Cuba joined his American Horror Story: Roanoake co-stars for a PaleyFest panel over the weekend, and for some reason, he thought it would be a good idea to hoist Sarah Paulson's skirt as she welcomed Kathy Bates to the stage. Yeah, we wish there were some context to make that act seem even slightly less insane, but there isn't. For reasons that will continue to defy explanation and common sense, Cuba Gooding Jr. decided to sexually harass his co-star in front of an audience of hundreds. Paulson and Gooding are friends, and those in attendance say she quickly brushed the incident off (after recoiling in horror upon realizing a man was lifting her skirt in front of hundreds of onlookers, of course), but none of that makes this even remotely okay. Let's say Gooding and Paulson are number one besties, and they playfully engage in this sort of behavior behind closed doors. This would still be wildly inappropriate behavior on Gooding's part. If he were a greeter at Wal Mart and he behaved this way with one of his co-workers, he would be fired on the spot. There's a good chance that Paulson was was appalled and baffled by Gooding's behavior as the rest of us, but downplayed her disgust simply because she wasn't sure of what else to do. We may never know for sure, but even if she was cool with it, what Cuba did on that stage is 700 kinds of not okay. Sadly, this is just the latest in a recent string of questionable behavior from Gooding. Last year, Gooding's wife, Sarah Kapfer, filed for divorce after 20 years of marriage. Rumors that Gooding had driven her to the brink with years of heavy drinking and erratic behavior seemed to be bolstered in the final years of their relationship, particularly when police issued a warrant for Gooding's arrest after he allegedly assaulted a bartender in New Orleans. Shortly thereafter, a very intoxicated Gooding unleashed a string of expletives at an award show, an incident that seemed funny at the time, but is a bit troubling when viewed in hindsight. We don't pretend to know exactly what's going on with Gooding, but here's hoping he gets the help he needs. Edit Delete Share Tweet Email Follow Cuba Gooding, Jr.?

The situation developed after an advertiser company working for the Guardian used Google’s AdX ad exchange to promote the newspaper subscription service. Following @thetimes investigation into online advertising, @guardian pulls ads from @youtube. This is why: pic.twitter.com/SqpnAxUiNM — Alexi Mostrous (@AlexiMostrous) March 16, 2017 The Guardian was warned of the situation last Thursday and quickly pulled their ads from Google's platform. As stated by Hamish Nicklin, chief revenue officer of Guardian News & Media: “We needed to react very, very quickly. We knew the next day that our brand, which is fundamentally important to us, was about to be splashed over the Times front page for all the wrong reasons.” But David Pemsel, the Guardian’s chief executive, went further and urged other brands to also blacklist Google-based ads until the company acts to guarantee this sort of ad misplacement won't happen again in the future. The result was a huge advertiser boycott that has already led more than 250 companies away from Google's ad platform. Here is a list of some of the biggest advertisers from the US and the UK who are no longer advertising with Google: UK US Argos Audi Aviva Havas Group UK (brands managed by the agency include Dominos Pizza, O2, Royal Mail, BBC, and Hyundai Kia) Heinz Honda HSBC ITV L'Oreal Lloyd's Bank Marks & Spencer McDonald's RBS Sainsbury's Tesco The Guardian Toyota Transport for London UK Government Volkswagen AT&T Beam Suntory Inc. Dish Network Enterprise FX Networks General Motors GSK Johnson & Johnson PepisCo Starbucks Verizon Walmart Following the Guardian's action, a Google's spokesman released the following statement promising to make the necessary changes to deal with the situation: “We accept that we don’t always get it right, and that sometimes, ads appear where they should not. We’re committed to doing better, and will make changes to our policies and brand controls for advertisers.” Finally, analysts are already estimating how much money Google may lose due to this massive boycott. YouTube was initially expected to have a $10.2 billion revenue for 2017, but updated projections estimate a reduction of about 7.5% of that amount, or $750 million.

The high court left in place a 2016 lower court decision that threw out the settlement on the basis that it was unfair to retailers that stood to receive no payments and derive no other benefits. The brief Supreme Court order noted that Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito did not participate in consideration of whether to take up the appeal. No reason was given. The settlement had been intended to resolve claims that merchants were overcharged on interchange fees, or “swipe fees,” when shoppers used credit or debit cards, and were barred from directing customers toward cheaper means of payment. The deal had been the largest all-cash U.S. antitrust settlement, although its value shrank to about $5.7 billion after roughly 8,000 retailers “opted out.” The New York-based 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals found that the accord was unfair to retailers that stood to receive no payments and, in the court’s view, little or no benefit at all. It also decertified the case as a class action. The circuit court’s decision was a blow to the credit card industry, which hoped the settlement would end a decade of litigation brought on behalf of about 12 million retailers against Visa, MasterCard and banks that issue their cards. Companies including Amazon.com Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc opposed the settlement and challenged it on appeal. Card issuers American Express Co and Discover Financial Services also objected to the settlement. A federal judge in Brooklyn had approved the settlement in 2013, saying it offered significant damages and meaningful protections against future harm. Many retailers and trade groups objected. Some said the payout should have been higher while others said the settlement would have made it too difficult to sue Visa and MasterCard. According to the National Retail Federation trade group, retailers pay roughly $60 billion annually in swipe fees, which typically average around 2 percent. Card-issuing banks would have funded much of the settlement. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp had estimated they were responsible for roughly one-fifth and one-tenth, respectively, of a payout. tags United States Supreme Court credit card Mastercard Visa more from business Levy for not keeping min balance in banks should be reasonable Mar 28, 2017 17:51 IST Use of Bitcoin illegal, can attract anti-money laundering law Mar 28, 2017 17:44 IST FD vs Stocks: Which One Should You Choose?

But it was a small mark against an otherwise incredibly fun evening. Counting Crows had Rob Thomas (who is also the lead singer of Matchbox 20 and perhaps most famous for singing Santana’s “Smooth”) open for them for shows all around the U.S. Thomas had remarked at how his band, Matchbox 20 had done covers of Crows’ songs previously. A few nights after the Coney Island show, Thomas and Duritz were at the small venue Bowery Electric doing songs as part of the Outlaw Roadshow. Some videos are posted below and you can see the closeness of the two singers. This summer those buddies are getting together again for another exciting string of shows. The press release exploits their mutual love, “No matter what I will ever do, nothing feels like home as much as playing these songs with these guys and it never will,“ says Matchbox Twenty lead singer-songwriter Rob Thomas. “And I can’t wait to spend another summer out there on the road with the Crows.”  Thomas previously teamed with Counting Crows for a hugely successful 2016 summer co-headline tour. “To be honest, we took a vote after last year and decided to spend every summer with Rob from now on,” says Counting Crows’ Adam Duritz. “Can. Not. Wait.” Check out photos from the Coney Island show, tour dates and the aforementioned videos below. And Duritz, if you are seeing this, please perform “Einstein” at Jones Beach. Presale tickets and VIP packages for “A Brief History of Everything Tour 2017” will be available to members of both bands’ fan clubs beginning Tuesday, March 28th and to the general public starting Friday, March 31st.

Robert Jourdain's minimum sentence was capped at 12 years under the terms of his guilty plea deal. Jourdain admitted buying the ammunition used by gunman Todd West to kill Kory Ketrow, Francine E. Ramos and Trevor D. Gray on July 5, 2015. The maximum sentence, though, was up to Lehigh County Judge James Anthony, and on Monday the judge sentenced Jourdain to 12 to 40 years in state prison, the most years allowed by law, for conspiracy to commit third-degree murder. The sentence was handed down after Jourdain apologized to the families of the three people killed in the July 5, 2015, crime spree that spanned from Easton to Allentown. Turning to face the courtroom audience, the shackled Jourdain said he hoped the families would be able to move forward from the devastating and senseless killings. "I apologize for my part in this. Can't take it back," he said. "I'm not a perfect person. I made a mistake." Rich Bader, whose family took in Ketrow, said he was giving Jourdain the benefit of the doubt, and that Jourdain didn't realize what was going to happen that night. "I hope you spend these next few years very wisely," Bader said. "I think you made some mistakes. You have this one opportunity to turn your life around." Bader said he hoped Jourdain would remember the words of the victims' families. "Think about what you did, what you took from us," he said. First Assistant District Attorney Steve Luksa said the shootings may not have occurred if Jourdain didn't buy the ammunition that night, and his actions were the first of a series of dominoes to fall. West of Elizabeth, N.J., was charged with seven killings in all -- the three in the Lehigh Valley and four before that in New Jersey. West previously admitted to randomly gunning down Ketrow in Easton, and Ramos and Gray in Allentown. Outrage at murderer's words: 'I just wanted to kill them' In exchange for West's guilty plea to three counts of first-degree murder, prosecutors dropped the death penalty. West was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences without the chance of parole. Jourdain bought a 50-count box of .38-caliber bullets about 2:30 a.m. July 5, 2015, at a Lower Nazareth Township Wal-Mart. There is no evidence Jourdain was threatened by West to purchase the ammunition West ultimately used, prosecutors previously said. A half-hour after the ammunition was purchased, West shot Ketrow. By 4 a.m., Allentown police found Ramos and Gray gunned down at Sixth and Greenleaf streets. West has said he chose the victims at random. The alleged getaway driver, Kareem Mitchell, is still awaiting trial in his case in Lehigh County. A trial date is slated for April 26. Mitchell, of Newark, previously told investigators that the night of July 4, 2015, he was giving Jourdain a ride with his 2-year-old son to Easton, and West, whom he had never met before, came with them. Prosecutors said Jourdain and West knew each other. After dropping off the child, the trio went to Allentown so West could get a haircut, then went to an after-hours club, according to police. MORE: Easton man charged with two others in Allentown murders After purchasing the ammunition, the trio was driving in Easton, when West spotted Ketrow. West told investigators Ketrow looked tired as he was walking along Lehigh Street, and that he was going to "help" Ketrow. After killing Ketrow, West opened fire at a Palmer Township woman stopped at a traffic light at Third and Spring Garden streets in Easton. West hit Helene Barone's car as she sped away, but Barone and her passenger escaped uninjured. As for his Allentown victims, at his plea hearing West said he killed the pair because "I just wanted to kill them." Mitchell drove the Mercedes SUV the entire night, until it was disabled by a damaged wheel. Eventually, Mitchell parked the damaged SUV in Allentown, bought a bus ticket back to northern New Jersey and walked around Allentown with the other two before taking a bus back home. Police said West and Jourdain then robbed three men in separate incidents in Allentown, injuring two of the victims. The pair were arrested after an Allentown officer saw them near North Morris and West Washington streets wearing clothes similar to those of two armed robbery suspects, police said. Investigators found a bag with 18 .38-caliber casings and the box of the remaining ammunition. The families of West's victims are suing Wal-Mart, claiming the employees in Lower Nazareth Township failed to confirm if Jourdain was at least 21 years old when he went to buy the bullets. Jourdain was 20 at the time. Walmart has argued in court that the .38-caiber ammunition can be used in rifles, and rifle ammunition can be sold to customers who are 18 or older.

EDT THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning, everybody.  Thank you very much.  It’s my pleasure to welcome such incredible women, including my daughter --  PARTICIPANTS:  Yeah!   THE PRESIDENT:  -- and unbelievable entrepreneurs and small business leaders to the White House.  And also, Linda, thank you very much.  You've been doing an amazing job -- I hear working 24 hours a day is what the word is.  (Laughter.)  Good.  I'm not surprised. ADMINISTRATOR McMAHON:  Trying to keep up with you.  (Laughter.)   THE PRESIDENT:  I'm not surprised.  And I want to thank  Linda for joining us today.  She's doing a fantastic job leading the Small Business Administration, and she herself, as you know, is a great, great success story and a woman entrepreneur at the highest level.  So thank you very much, Linda.  Empowering and promoting women in business is an absolute priority in the Trump administration because I know how crucial women are as job creators, role models, and leaders all throughout our communities. As we conclude Women’s History Month, I am thrilled that we can meet to discuss how we can continue this important mission.  You all have incredible stories.  Many of you started businesses from scratch, with very, very limited resources -- sounds like I'm right about you, Lisa, right?  (Laughter.)  But you had the grit and determination to make your dreams become a reality, right? ADMINISTRATOR McMAHON:  Yes. THE PRESIDENT:  It's fantastic.  Now you're providing hundreds of jobs across our country -- thousands of jobs.  And you're really an inspiration to everybody -- and that's men and women, believe me.  A lot of men out there, they're not doing what you're able to do.   Today, women are the primary source of income in 40 percent of American households with children under the age of 15.  We also know that companies that promote women to senior leadership roles realize significantly better profits, according to statistics, than their competitors.  I wouldn’t have known that.  Dina, how does that work?  Tell me.  That's pretty impressive.    We must ensure that our economy is a place where women can work and thrive.  We will continue to address the barriers faced by women professionals and entrepreneurs, including access to capital, access to markets, and access to networks.  We will make it very easy.  It's going to be a lot easier.  You do an amazing job.  And for a while it was a very, very tough -- almost impossible -- job. My administration will also continue to advocate for policies that support working families, including making childcare more affordable and accessible.  That's something that Ivanka Trump -- now Ivanka Trump Kushner -- that you really have been working on and feel so strongly about -- my daughter.  I actually talked about it a lot during the campaign, and Ivanka was right up front.  I also want to recognize Ivanka for helping to lead a national initiative to promote women business leaders and entrepreneurs.  And the Chancellor of Germany is going to -- has asked Ivanka to go to Germany, and she'll be working on similar issues with Chancellor Merkel.  So that will be very exciting for you.  That's going to happen very soon.  It's a very great honor. I look forward to hearing your stories and discussing how we can work together to help all of your dreams come true and make it easier for those dreams to come true.   And with that, I'm going to turn it over to our great Vice President, Mike Pence.  And thank you, Mike, for being here. THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And I want to thank all these business leaders for taking the time for a conversation with a President who I think is going to be the best friend that small business in America will ever have.  And I believe that President Donald Trump is the best friend that women in business in this country will ever have.  It is remarkable to think, here at the close of Women's History Month, of the impact that women-owned businesses have on our economy, Mr. President -- more than 9.4 million firms, employing 8 million Americans, and annual revenues of $1.5 trillion.   Women business owners and women-owned enterprises are an enormous force in the American economy, and I know this President is committed to continuing to promote the kinds of policies that will make it possible for your firms to grow, and for more women-led businesses to be born and to thrive all across America.  The President is advancing an agenda of less regulation, less taxes, and investments in infrastructure, fair trade, and addressing healthcare costs to make healthcare affordable, not only for small business owners but for employees across the country. Mr. President, I'm particularly pleased to be able to welcome a fellow Hoosier -- (laughter) -- to this conversation, Ms. Shirley Ann Perry.  The owner of HydroTech is with us today, and she herself has a remarkable success story. With that said, it's a privilege for me to be alongside the President today to listen in and to learn how we might better partner with each one of you and with women-owned businesses across the country to grow and thrive in this economy.  And one of the great women business leaders in the country is helping the administration accomplish that, and so let me turn it over to Ivanka Trump. MS. TRUMP:  Thank you, Vice President.  And thank you all so much for being here.  It's the perfect culmination of Women's History Month to have all of you around the table sharing with us both your successes and also the unique challenges that you face as women entrepreneurs and small business owners. I feel very blessed to have met so many of you over the course of the past couple months -- Lisa in Baltimore; right here in D.C., Claudia -- and hearing your personal stories and your journeys of how you became job creators.  And you truly exemplify women's economic empowerment. So we're grateful to have you join us today.  And maybe we'll launch right in -- Claudia, if you want to start us off and tell us a little bit about your personal experience. MS. MIRZA:  My personal experience.  Thank you very much for taking the time to listen to us.  It means a lot as small business owners.  Akorbi is a company with 930 employees.  I started it after I lost my job.  We provide multilingual business communications around the world to empower global corporations to do business abroad.   THE PRESIDENT:  Great.  And you've done a great job.  MS. MIRZA:  Thank you. THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Lisa. MS. NICHOLS:  I'm Lisa Nichols.  I'm the CEO and co-founder of Technology Partners.  We're an information technology staffing and solutions company working across the nation.  We will celebrate our 23rd birthday May the 4th.  And just very, very blessed to be a part of this roundtable.  Thank you so much.  I'm very thankful. THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  And I hear that Lisa Phillips has an amazing story to tell.  (Laughter.)  Can you tell it in front of all these cameras?  (Laughter.)  I hear that you have one of the really amazing stories to tell.  So you want me to ask the press to leave?  I will.  (Laughter.)   Go ahead. MS. PHILLIPS:  I just hope I don’t cry.  So thank you, Ivanka, Dina, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President.  Thank you for this platform.  I’m Lisa Phillips.  I’m the owner of Celeebrate Us -- gift baskets and parties.  I celebrate families.   I provide working families with very elaborate events that they otherwise wouldn’t be able to afford.  And my own personal story -- I manage and help train homeless youth because I was once homeless myself.  And I really, really, really was almost to the point of hopelessness.  And so -- but what a great country we live in.  This is a country of chances.  And I’ve been given chances, and so I employ people that need a chance.  And so, in May, I’ll be receiving my MBA, and you’re all invited to my graduation.  (Applause.) But one of the things that is required for this country is hard work.  And if you are willing to work hard, you’ll get that chance.  And so I’m a product of hard work, and so that’s what this country was built on.  And thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you for giving us a seat at the table, because what we do is we’re going to take this back to people that couldn’t be here, and give them the information and empower them.   There’s a dress owner at the store next to me, and I’m wearing one of his outfits.  So I’m going to take pictures, and he’s going to send these pictures back to India, to his family.  And so that’s how we help one another as business owners.  We give someone else a platform.  So thank you.  THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Great job.  You’ve done a fantastic job.  Thank you, Lisa. MS. TRUMP:  One of the things that I was so amazed in your story -- and everyone around this table -- is not only the incredible job that you’ve done in building your businesses, but also the impact you’re having within your communities in terms of the work you’re doing to empower other men and women and children.  So it’s really remarkable. MS. PHILLIPS:  Thank you so much.  Because the worst thing you can feel is hopeless.  And so the youth that I train, the homeless, when they’re dealing with breast cancer, I’ll do a workshop and empower them that, hey, that no matter where you are, that you can be elevated.  Just look around, you’re going to find someone that’s willing to cheer you on.  And so we just graduated a group of youth from our homeless unit in Baltimore -- our homeless program -- and now they’re working at one of the local hospitals.  And one of the hospital officials actually called me and said, can you send us some more.  So kudos to those young people -- THE PRESIDENT:  That’s great. MS. PHILLIPS:  -- that they really want to be able to advocate. THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Lisa.  Thank you very much. MS. POPE-WELLS:  That’s a great story.  My name is Amy Pope-Wells.  I’m the owner of Link Staffing, but I also own another company called Tire Diva.  There’s not too many females in the tire business -- (inaudible).   THE PRESIDENT:  Great name, actually.  (Laughter.)  MS. POPE-WELLS:  Thank you, Mr. President.  You know, coming here today, I was thinking about what I would say, and my businesses are my passion, but we would never have a place at this table if it wasn’t for you.  Opening up your new administration is doing so much, and I need you to know that we’re taking that to our communities.   One of the things that happened for me was -- part of my story is, I was a nurse by graduation, and I spent years -- and that was the status quo in the community that I lived in, but something inside of me wanted to do more.  And I’ll never forget, my first job was an executive job, flying across the United States, going hospital to hospital, looking at the challenges and the problems, and I did that for 15 years, and it just felt like I was banging my head up against a wall, but I knew there was so much more opportunity.   So I went and started my own company.  I said, you know what, I’ll just be a boutique firm, but you can’t keep that inside.  So I started my business and grew it.  Started partnering with companies like Walmart and Starbucks, and just working myself to the bone to service them.  And everybody was like, why are you doing that?  And it’s like, because it’s the right thing to do.  I’m giving hundreds of people jobs.   And that led those relationships over to starting Tire Diva.  What I did was I took that, and I started the Women’s Empowerment Foundation three years ago, and I would bring -- I bring 75 to 100, give or take, women that come, and I want them to have that inspiration.  And sometimes it’s difficult.  But being here at this table gives me the inspiration to keep going, because I want to share that and make people feel empowered.  You always have to work hard, so there’s no quick, easy way to do it.  But if you can provide a guide, that’s where it’s at, you know? THE PRESIDENT:  Good job. MS. POPE-WELLS:  Thank you. THE PRESIDENT:  Great enthusiasm.  Good.  Thank you. Yes, Lili. MS. GIL VALLETTA:  Yes, first of all, thank you so much, Ivanka.  You've been a facilitator for us.  I know that you, at the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, have been instrumental in getting four of us Latinas around the table.  So I’m proud to be one of them, and grateful for the issues and challenges that we face.  I’m an immigrant from Colombia, and I came to this country with a suitcase, and a student visa, and a pocket translator -- without speaking a word of a English -- at the age of 17.   And then fast-forward, and after a successful corporate career -- I was at Johnson & Johnson for 10 years -- passion drove me to quit my corporate job, which was very comfortable.  But what drove me was the shifting demographics of this country.  If we are quickly becoming a majority minority nation, we have the advantage -- economic advantage -- of diversity.  So what I do for a living with CIEN+, a culture (inaudible) big data analytics company, is helping the corporate leaders and Fortune 500 companies understand how to turn shifting demographics into money, into our lives, into growth.   And that’s why I’m here.  I’m so delighted to share more about my journey as an immigrant.  We are there, working hard, and the American Dream is real.  So thank you for the opportunity to share with you, with Mr. Vice President as well, the SBA Administrator.  I can’t wait to find solutions for us to work together positively forward.   THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Lili, very much.  Thank you. MS. PERRY:  Hi, I’m Shirley Perry.  I’m from Anderson, Indiana.  I’m a very small environmental group engaged in environmental cleanups and environmental consulting.   I have seven employees, so I’m little.  We started it 30 years ago, and then I became sole owner in 2013.  And we just do what we can for the environment.  We clean up around gas stations, dry cleaners.  We do testing of asbestos and mold.  And it’s just a good business to have, and it’s a great day to be here.   THE PRESIDENT:  You've done a great job.  Thank you very much.  MS. PERRY:  Thank you.  THE PRESIDENT:  Linda, would you like to say something?   ADMINISTRATOR McMAHON:  Well, I’m just delighted to be here this morning.  And I know what it’s like for women who are often working in a male environment.  Goodness knows, I can recognize that.  (Laughter.)   But it’s just great to hear all of the stories from all of you, and I’m really excited to be at SBA because we do have our Women’s Business Centers.  We do have those centers to help guide, to help and advise, to help them do business plans.  And we have them all over the country.   So we welcome you to come in, or for people who would like to (inaudible) to our centers, who would like to be helpful in any way we can -- helping to provide more access to capital.  And I think we were talking about, Amy, just sometimes you just need a little wind beneath your wings.  So we're going to help provide hard information, but also a little wind beneath your wings.   So thank you, Mr. President.   THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Linda.  Great job. ADMINISTRATOR McMAHON:  Thank you, Ivanka, Dina for setting this up.  I’m really pleased to be here. THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thanks so very much. MS. FUNEGRA:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Ivanka.  That feels like a second date, right?  (Laughter.)  MS. TRUMP:  I feel very fortunate.   MS. FUNEGRA:  We got together a little more than 10 days ago through the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and I’m proud to represent immigrants and Hispanics today.  I’m also an immigrant.  I moved from Peru 10 years ago to work in international development for a multilateral organization here.  And I also quit my job and used my savings to start La Cocina VA, which is "the kitchen."  It’s an organization that provides vocational and technical education and jobs to unemployed and under-employed immigrant women, in partnership with local governments, with higher education institutions, with private sector, and help this population to start businesses. So when Lisa mentioned how important it is to make our dreams come true, I have a unique position:  I help others make their dreams come true with vocational education, empowering women to believe in the possibility of success and open businesses.  So the model that we are ready to replicate now in other cities and in other communities integrates governments, integrates private sector, and all the power and resources that that represents in order to really make impactful results in our communities.  And we're growing as communities.  Thank you.   THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much. MS. SCANLON RABINOWITZ:  Hello.  My name is Suzie Scanlon Rabinowitz.  I am co-founder and managing director of an alternative legal model.  We have a national network of more than 20,000 well-credentialed attorneys who are immediately available to support any legal department on a full-time or part-time engagement basis. And how we're making a difference is the legal industry has historically really been challenged in working with women on a more flexible basis and also the diversity and inclusion issues.  And so my businesses are helping to allow women who are returning to the profession after leaving to raise a family or take care of an aging parent come back and work on a more flexible basis. And also what we're doing is we provide lawyers on an engagement basis to help Fortune 500 companies.  And we're able to address some of the unconscious biases that exist by promoting women and minorities in roles that typically wouldn’t go to women and minorities.  And when our clients see how terrific our lawyers are, we give them permission to hire them directly.  And it’s really making an impact on promoting women and minorities at the highest level. THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  Great. MS. SCANLON RABINOWITZ:  Thank you. THE PRESIDENT:  Where are you based? MS. SCANLON RABINOWITZ:  So we're a virtual platform, but based in New York and Connecticut. THE PRESIDENT:  That's wonderful.  Great job, thank you.  Thanks, Suzie. MS. SCANLON RABINOWITZ:  Thank you. MS. GIBBENS:  Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Dina, Ivanka, Administrator McMahon, it is an honor and pleasure to be here as part of this process. I am Dyan Gibbens; I lead Trumbell Unmanned.  We're a Houston-based, a Forbes Top 25, veteran-founded company, and we provide critical data to the energy sector.  And we fly drones in challenging and austere environments.   Now, we primarily support oil and gas in environmental efforts, and we're all engineers, UV operators, and pilots.  You know how you know if someone is a pilot?  They’ll tell you.  (Laughter.)  They’ll tell you that a personal passion is promoting STEM for the next generation.  And we've partnered with BP for drone camps at Rice University.  We've partnered with Intel for a global STEM initiative.  We hope to reach thousands -- tens of thousands with that.  We've also partnered with Microsoft for an online drone academy that we hope to reach millions of people.   So my goal today is to help change this meeting and create a movement.  And thank you for your time. THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  That sounds fantastic.  Thank you.   Okay, folks, thank you.  (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, the most important --  MS. JOHNSON:  Good morning, Mr. President, Vice President, Ivanka --  THE PRESIDENT:  Stay for Jessica.   MS. JOHNSON:  Administrator McMahon, my name is Jessica Johnson-Cope.  I’m the president and CEO of Johnson Security Bureau.  This week, Johnson Security will celebrate its 55th anniversary.  We are a third-generation, family-owned and operated security services firm based in the South Bronx of New York.  And we provide security guard services, as well as armored car services to protect people, places, and valuable property across the New York metropolitan area.   And I really relate to your story.  I relate to your working closely with Ivanka and working side by side because I took over my family’s business once my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer.  And we worked in the trenches until he passed away.  And so I really respect what you two do together and hope to be able to continue our family legacy, and to help other family-owned businesses as a result of our conversation today. THE PRESIDENT:  Great job.  Great job, Jessica.  Thank you.  Thank you very much, everybody.  END  11:31 A.M.

(DAVID BRENDAN HALL, CONTRIBUTING PHOTOGRAPHER FILE PHOTO) Related article » More from this story SLIDE SHOW: Your Coachella 2017 packing list should include these 9 things 5 Photos » Riverside Yellow Pages THINGS TO DO     By Vanessa Franko / vfranko@scng.com Published: March 26, 2017 Updated: March 28, 2017 9:39 a.m. Spring has arrived and the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival is on the horizon. Radiohead, Lady Gaga and Kendrick Lamar will headline the 2017 edition of the popular music festival at the Empire Polo Club in Indio April 14-16 and April 21-23. Before you go to the desert, this is what to pack for Coachella 2017 to get you through the festival. And if you need some inspiration on what to wear to Coachella, we've got some ideas for you. 1.Sunscreen You’re going to the desert. The Empire Polo Club is massive with wide open fields and there’s not a ton of shade. Wear sunscreen and don’t forget to reapply. Even if you’re going to be rolling into the festival after the sun sets, you will still want to pack it for the pool. Pro tip 1: Bring a lip balm that is at least SPF 15. A sunburn on your lips makes being sun-kissed very unpleasant. Pro tip 2: Aerosol spray sunscreens are not allowed inside the festival. Apply them before leaving the hotel or parking lot and bring liquid sunscreen inside. And don’t try to smuggle in liquor in the sunscreen bottle--security checks for that. 2. Water Again, you’re going to the desert. Dehydration is serious business. Drink water on the way in and use the empty bottle at free refilling stations around the venue. You can bring in empty plastic (non-metal) bottles 40 ounces and under, according to the Coachella FAQ. Empty Bota Bags and CamelBaks are also allowed. If you need to buy some, it’s $2 per bottle on the field. Also, you can trade in 10 empty bottles for one fresh one. Pro tip: Keep an extra bottle of water in your car. After the long, dusty walk back to the parking lot, it is welcome, even if it is a little warm. 3. Hat Did we mention the whole going to the desert thing? Nobody wants a scalp sunburn. Feel free to bring your best Lady Gaga “Joanne”-style chapeau--a full hat with a wide brim is ideal, but even a baseball cap helps. Pro tip: Flower crowns do not block out the sun. Related: Coachella, Stagecoach announce ticket sales for local residents 4. Comfortable shoes Your Fitbit will be happy as you log miles upon miles trekking around the Empire Polo Club. Your feet will be happy if you’re wearing comfortable shoes. I’ve been going to Coachella for more than a decade and I am still confused by people who wear high heels. It’s a grassy field, you’re going to sink. Don’t try to break in new kicks for the weekend. If you go the flip-flop route, remember that nearly 100,000 people could step on your feet. Pro tip: Keep a couple of adhesive bandages around if you get blisters. And it never hurts to have a backup pair of shoes in the car just in case you lose one in the Sahara Tent. Related: 7 T-shirts to complete your Coachella 2017 look 5. Bandana This is the must-have wonder accessory for Coachella. It can block out the dust and the sun and if it’s too hot, you can soak it in water and put it on your neck to cool off. You can get creative and make your own, too. An infinity scarf is also a good option. Walking back to your car along the dusty paths, you will be so happy to have a bandana covering your mouth. And if a big sandstorm hits, you’re covered. A dust mask from a home improvement store also works. Pro tip: If you forget a hat, you can fashion the bandana to cover your head and keep you from that scalp sunburn. 6. Sunglasses Remember that whole thing about being in the desert? Yeah, it’s bright. Protect your eyes. Pro tip: If you lose your sunglasses, check out Target or Walmart along Highway 111 in La Quinta. Anything you buy inside the Coachella compound is far more expensive. That goes for sunscreen, too. 7. Phone charger I don’t care how great your phone is, it’s going to die at Coachella. The good news: Around the field there are plenty of spots to charge your phone now, so bring your cable and a plug and you can juice up while grabbing a refreshment in the Craft Beer Barn. Pro tip: Bring a USB external battery for your phone. You can roam and see sets and still charge up. Pro tip 2: Speaking of phones, realize that even if you charge your battery, the number of people on the network can make service go down at peak times. Make a plan with friends for a specific meeting spot and time. 8. Ear plugs You want to be able to hear people after your trip to Coachella. Ear plugs are a must. Splurge on the fancy ones that Doppler Labs have put out, or just go for the cheap-o ones at the drug store. Either way, your ears will thank you. Pro tip: If you’re using inexpensive disposable ones, bring a couple of pairs each day. You’re likely to lose one here and there.

Hand sanitizer If you’ve never been to Coachella, know that it’s a giant field with dirt and grass and, like, 100,000 or so people. You’re going to want to clean your hands and if you aren’t near the real bathrooms or porta potties, hand sanitizer a good idea.

Crisis lines provide thousands of hours of emotional support and resource information to people in distress in our communities each year. They offer service 24/7 and deal with some of the toughest challenges people face, mental health issues, substance abuse, relationship problems, sexual assault, even suicidal ideation and intent. In 2016, 800 crisis line workers across the province responded to 130,000 calls for help. In 11,000 of these calls, suicide was identified as the presiding issue. A total of 20,000 follow up and outreach calls were also made, and in some cases, interventions enacted if the safety of a caller was at risk. As a discrete and confidential service, the work that crisis lines do rarely makes headlines, but they form an indispensable safety net for communities across the province. Crisis Line Awareness Week is an opportunity to recognize the significant contribution they make. If you are concerned about suicide, either for yourself or someone you know, now is the time to reach out by calling 1-800-784-2433. To mark this year’s Crisis Line Awareness Week, the Crisis Line in Williams Lake, (part of the Interior Crisis Line Network), will have an information table set up at Save-On-Foods on Monday, March 27 and at Walmart on Tuesday, March 28. We will be starting the next Crisis Line training on April 24, 2017. The training will be on Monday and Wednesday evenings from 6 to 9 p.m. until May 31, 2017. If you, or someone you know is interested in volunteering on the Crisis Line, please call Janice at 250-398-8220 ext. 2040 or Heather at 250-398-8220 ext 2031, or stop by Canadian Mental Health Association office at 51 Fourth Ave. South to pick up an application form.

March 27, 2017 by Staff   Filed under Business, Money, Opinion, Weekly Columns Leave a Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 1 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) Starting a business can wreak havoc on your personal life. While all the tips mentioned below are necessary for success, taking care of yourself mentally and physically is also imperative. Exercise, sleep and diet play a central role in ensuring you implement these policies successfully. African Americans needs to take care of their hearts as heart disease is one of the largest silent killers in our community. All of them drive attitude, motivation and relationships. 1. Love what you do. Passion is key to keeping a business strategy moving. Half-heartedness in an entrepreneurial endeavor will chip away at your drive to succeed. Perseverance is the one thing that’s guaranteed to move anything over time, whether it’s a person, a job or an entire company. Abraham Lincoln failed at most of his efforts until late in his life, but he never gave up. 2. Take baby steps. Jumping all in is rarely ever successful. There are success stories about people who invested everything once and came out winners after six months or a couple years, but those are rare. Risk management is an essential factor in any startup, and balance is vital. You can absorb losses more easily if you take smaller risks in the beginning. Those will provide essential and productive lessons. 3. Learn from others. Successful entrepreneurs often worked for others in their field of choice before striking out on their own. Spending a few years in the industry under an excellent mentor will provide a good launching pad. Learn from your predecessors’ mistakes and brainstorm about how to improve upon their model. Find someone willing to teach, and think about starting your business elsewhere when you leave. 4. Learn how to self-promote. Confidence and a good elevator speech can take any pitch to the next level. The first marketing any company experiences comes from its founder. Spend time learning how to share your vision without coming across as “salesy.” Don’t be afraid to ask for the sale, but remember: the client is always the focus. 5. Constantly take action. Entrepreneurs are movers and shakers. They can’t afford to analyze every detail or they’d never get anywhere. There is no place for procrastination in a startup. It’s a 24/7, no-vacation-or-sick-days kind of job that demands constant forward momentum. Make a brief assessment at every step and move on it. Trust your instincts. 6. Make a plan. Read about successful businesses. Take in the wealth of knowledge that’s been provided by successful entrepreneurs such as Steve Jobs and the personalities from Shark Tank. A successful business plan does not have to be a book. A 10-page plan is digestible yet long enough to include everything you need to start. 7. Build a reputation. According to Brandi Bennett at HostGator.com, maintaining a blog on a well-hosted website, or volunteering your time and skills, shows instead of tells the community, and thereby builds expertise and trust. 8. It’s never too late to start. Many successful entrepreneurs started later in life. J. K. Rowling (Harry Potter author), Julia Child (chef), and Sam Walton (Wal-Mart) all started their wildly successful brands after they were comfortably along in their lives. Having the experience that comes with age can give you a unique outlook on your business. Life experiences bring depth that the most educated young adult, by his or her nature, is less able to foresee. 9. Build your “A team”. Finding the skill sets and attitudes that support the culture of the brand you want to promote will foster innovation and enhance your reputation. Include folks from outside the company for the people you rely on. That will start a free marketing chain reaction that can build confidence and revenue. 10. Be mindful of your attitude. The attitude of the founder will set the tone for the business. Negativity, laziness and entitlement waste time and money while they tarnish your reputation. Success largely depends on making mistakes and accepting blame in stride. Owning up to and facing challenges head-on is what makes a mere business owner a leader. Successful Black CEOs tend to follow a structured, daily schedule of rising early, exercising, having snacks on hand for fuel and socializing many evenings of the week.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    President Trump, having failed to close the deal to replace Obamacare, has set his sights on tax reform, which he considers an easier issue to tackle. He’s hallucinating. Obamacare is a tax. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, in 2012, ruled as such in “National Federation of Independent Business et al v. Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services, et al.” “The Affordable Care Act’s requirement that certain individuals pay a financial penalty for not obtaining health insurance may reasonably be characterized as a tax. Because the Constitution permits such a tax, it is not our role to forbid it, or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness,” Roberts wrote for the majority. Amazingly, hours after declaring his intention to move on from healthcare, the president opined that Obamacare is still fixable, with bipartisan support from Democrats — the same folks who forced the cancerous law on America, in 2010, with nary a Republican vote. Why, then, can’t the Republicans eradicate Obamacare without the Democrats? After all, they own the House, Senate, and White House. Simple: Republicans are bipartisan. Some, including the Freedom Caucus, want to shrink government and cut taxes. RINOs (Republicans in name only), like Democrats, want to expand government and increase taxes. Instead of obliterating Obamacare, the malignant tax, the divided House Republicans, led poorly by Speaker Paul Ryan, advanced a three-phase, big-government replacement: the American Health Care Act, or AHCA. Bringing the Democrats aboard, therefore, would compound the problem. It would generate a tripartisan mess, not a solution, thereby breaking Mr. Trump’s campaign promise and worsening American healthcare. The only way to cure any cancer is to completely eradicate it, not create a substandard workaround, lest it spread to kill its host body. The AHCA was a substandard workaround. One of the biggest excuses for forging ahead with the AHCA, despite its defects: Too many insurance companies have pulled out; what else could we do? For starters, repeal the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945, which prohibits carriers from selling health-insurance policies across state lines. Then, lure the carriers back. Recall the corporations whose CEOs have promised to keep or add jobs in America, based on President Trump’s gravitas and outreach: Carrier, GM, Ford, Softbank, Amazon, IBM, Walmart, and Lockheed Martin. Why didn’t Mr. Trump do likewise with the insurance carriers, in exchange for promising to excise Obamacare, in concert with Republican legislators? Good question. He would have succeeded. But, he relied too heavily and blindly on Paul Ryan, who couldn’t walk his talk. Mistake. Had Trump been proactive, he could have overcome the resistance of RINOs like Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, who complained that the AHCA would leave too many of her constituents without insurance and deprive the poor and elderly of funds for their healthcare. Only marketplace-oriented healthcare, with interstate competition and freedom of choice, can decrease prices and increase value. Government can’t do this. If President Trump tries to cut income taxes with the same strategy, tactics, and crew he employed to cut the Obamacare tax, he’ll fail again. What is the core problem? Democrats are organized. They row in the same direction — albeit toward Venezuela, the imploding socialist nation, where people fight in the streets for food — but, they are in-sync! The GOP is schizophrenic about what it means to be a Republican. Only the minority of Republicans, conservatives, are small-r republicans, who honor the Constitution, small government, individual liberty, property rights, and fiscal responsibility. RINOs, who crave approval from liberals, loathe conservatives. They use their party as camouflage and talk a good game. In reality, they’re statist profligates. Mitch McConnell, senate majority leader and prototypical RINO, pledged during his 2014 reelection campaign to repeal Obamacare, “root and branch.” After winning, he demurred, claiming cowardly that it would be impossible without a Republican president. Democrats are never ashamed to be spendthrifts, social-justice warriors, and open-border advocates. But, RINOs are awkward, apologetic fiscal warriors and constitutional guardians. What can small-government voters do? The GOP needs RINOplasty, the surgical removal of ersatz Republicans. This is the only way the party can give voters the small government they demand. But, GOP apparatchiks won’t perform this surgery. Voters must do it. Where to begin? Before operating, surgeons must know where and what to cut. ConservativeReview.com provides a “liberty score” (100 is perfect) of every federal legislator in America. Here are the scores of Republican lawmakers mentioned above: Paul Ryan, WI (51); Mitch McConnell, KY (40); and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, FL (24). Don your scrubs.

Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest Rob Lawson/Getty Creative Check your freezers: OK Foods has just issued a massive recall of nearly 1 million pounds of breaded chicken. The chicken recall was issued due to possible contamination with "extraneous materials," specifically metal, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service. The contamination was discovered after OK Foods received five separate complaints from consumers saying that they had found metal objects in the ready-to-eat chicken products. An internal investigation by the firm confirmed the contamination and determined that the metal shards found in the chicken were from metal conveyor belting. The chicken affected had gone through production between Dec. 19, 2016, and March 7, 2017, and includes several different variations of OK Foods's breaded chicken products, including its ABC-shaped chicken nuggets and herbed, seasoned chicken breasts. These products were distributed to retailers nationwide, including some Walmart stores. The agency said that there have been no reports of illness or injury as a result of consuming the contaminated chicken. However, anyone who has purchased those chicken products is urged not to eat them—they should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

Things to do in the Lehigh Valley this week News Local News Police Bullet-buyer in random killing spree gets 12 to 40 years NORTHAMPTON COUNTY/HANDOUT Robert Jourdain Robert Jourdain (NORTHAMPTON COUNTY/HANDOUT) Laurie Mason SchroederContact ReporterOf The Morning Call Bullet-buyer in random spree killing to be sentenced It was a joyride gone wrong, a night of hanging out and driving around that ended in unspeakable tragedy. For Robert A. Jourdain, the predawn hours of July 5, 2015, in which he admittedly bought bullets for a friend who used them in a random shooting spree in Easton and Allentown that left three people dead, led to prison bars and regret. "I never once thought this was cool, that it was all right," Jourdain, 22, told the victims' families, who filled several benches in a Lehigh County courtroom Monday. "I do want to apologize for the part I played in all of this. I can't take it back." Judge James T. Anthony sentenced Jourdain to 12 to 40 years in a state prison. The sentence was the result of a plea deal reached when Jourdain pleaded guilty on Feb. 6 to conspiracy to commit third-degree murder. Jourdain, of Easton, admitted that he bought a box of bullets at the Wal-Mart in Lower Nazareth Township for Todd West, 24, of Elizabeth, N.J., who then used them to gun down Kory Ketrow, 22, of Easton, and Trevor Gray, 22, and Francine Ramos, 32, both of Allentown. Families in Lehigh Valley slayings clear obstacle in suit against Walmart Peter Hall The families of three people murdered in a 2015 shooting spree in Allentown and Easton have cleared a significant hurdle in their lawsuit to hold Walmart responsible for selling the ammunition used in the slayings to an underage and possibly intoxicated buyer in the wee hours of the morning. A... The families of three people murdered in a 2015 shooting spree in Allentown and Easton have cleared a significant hurdle in their lawsuit to hold Walmart responsible for selling the ammunition used in the slayings to an underage and possibly intoxicated buyer in the wee hours of the morning. A... (Peter Hall) West pleaded guilty in October to three counts of first-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison. Kareem Mitchell, 24, of Newark, who is accused of driving the car from crime scene to crime scene, is in Lehigh County Prison awaiting trial. In court Monday, Ketrow's father, Richard Bader, told Jourdain that he's robbed the entire community of a kindhearted young man who wanted only to help others. Bader said he did not believe Jourdain was an evil person, but said he could not understand what was going through the defendants' minds as they cruised around the Lehigh Valley hunting victims. Friends remember Kory Ketrow, Easton homicide victim Kory Ketrow lived with the Bader family for three years prior to his death on sunday. The family and friends talk about him fondly.

See more videos "To me, it seems like you had no regard for life whatsoever," Bader said. Trevor Gray's father, Joseph Gray, told Jourdain that he helped snuff out a life that was just beginning. Trevor Gray was a talented singer who was working his way through college, his father said. "He was a very outstanding young man who will be missed. This is not only a loss to our family but to the community and society at large," Gray said. The killing spree started shortly after 3 a.m. in Easton when West shot and killed Ketrow, who was just steps away from his Lehigh Street home. West would later tell detectives that he shot Ketrow because Ketrow looked "tired." Police say the trio then drove to Third and Spring Garden streets in Easton, where West fired several shots at a vehicle stopped at a red light. No one was injured, though a bullet lodged in the vehicle's tire. The men then drove west to Allentown. There, West shot Gray and Ramos, who were in a car at Sixth and Greenleaf streets. Ramos died in the car. Gray was found in a pool of blood in the street. West and Jourdain were arrested the next day after allegedly robbing several people at knife point in Allentown. Mitchell turned himself in a few days later. West, who has been indicted in New Jersey for four homicides, told police that he heard the devil speaking to him during the Lehigh Valley shooting spree, urging him to kill more people. Jourdain has no prior record but was involved in the juvenile justice system as a teen, his attorney, Christopher Shipman, said Monday. Jourdain had a tumultuous upbringing, Shipman said, but did better when he was supervised by juvenile probation officers. "That shows he can change," Shipman said. "He will come out of prison young enough to productively enter society." Under the terms of the plea deal, Jourdain was guaranteed a 12-year minimum sentence, but Anthony had the option of setting the maximum at between 24 and 40 years. First Assistant District Attorney Steven Luksa argued for 40 years, saying Jourdain learned nothing from his brushes with the law as a teen. "Best-case scenario, he demonstrated extremely poor judgment," Luksa said. lmason@mcall.com Twitter @LehighCourts 610-820-6506 Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, The Morning Call Trials and Arbitration Homicide Judge: Ammo lawsuit tied to Valley slayings going back to Philly court DA to seek death penalty against Todd West, alleged gunman in Allentown, Easton killings Three trials possible in 'random' killing spree that hit Allentown, Easton Breaking Popular Obits Arts & Ent Biz Cycle Sports Video/Photos Classifieds 50°

His most recent series is God Country at Image Comics, which launched to huge acclaim, and now he's looking to follow it up with another new creator-owned series from Image. Redneck is a new horror series from Cates and artists Lisandro Estherren and Dee Cunniffe about a family of Texan vampires coming April 19 from Robert Kirkman's Skybound imprint. I had a chance to read the first issue, and it's a fantastically subversive horror story. Redneck is surprising, full of immediately memorable characters, and is even bitingly funny in parts. The art is shadowy and expressive, accompanied by an appropriately haunting palette. This is one vampire comic that definitely doesn't suck. I got an opportunity to ask Cates a few questions about what sets Redneck apart, the Texas setting, working with Skybound and, of course, how they get the blood out of their mustaches. Check out the interview below, along with a preview of the bloody great first issue. Despite their having been around for so long, vampires and zombies have a bit of a stigma on them recently as having been overused. What's your elevator pitch to sell people on Redneck, and what do you think makes it a unique addition the vampire genre? Donny Cates: Yeah, sure, the short of it is this: Redneck follows the Bowmans, an ancient family of vampires living in East Texas. When our story picks up they are trying their best to break a pattern of violence they themselves put in motion hundreds of years ago. Trying to atone for the blood they've spilled. Trying like hell to not be monsters anymore. But, as you'll see as the series moves along, well, sometimes besides their best intentions, things tend to get pretty monstrous after all. Time will tell if it's a worthy entry in regards to the vampire-story pantheon, but for me at least, it's not really about that. I think the best vampire stories (and zombies, and most monster stories) are always talking about something else. They use the monsters as a stand-in to talk about a larger issue. Redneck is about family. A family trying to be better than their own past. You mentioned the Texas setting, and that’s a familiar one in your work, with your other Image book, God Country, taking place there. What about Texas makes you want to explore it in these different ways? And isn’t that a lot of sunshine for a vampire family? Yeah, it's not an ideal situation for them no matter how you slice it. And as far as the setting goes, it's my home. It's what I know and it inspires me. Stephen King has Maine; I have the great state of Texas. The settings also really serve the story as well. God Country is set in West Texas (Specifically the Marathon/Alpine/Big Bend area) and Redneck is in East Texas (Sulphur Springs ... at first). Anyone who's ever been to either and seen the other can tell you, they might as well take place on different planets. West Texas is old like a forgotten ancient temple. East Texas is old like a dying dog. West Texas is mysterious like buried treasure. East Texas is mysterious like a hole filled with snakes. It's rough, rusty country. Ideal if you wanted people to leave you the hell alone for a few centuries or so. One is great for gods. One is great for vampires. Despite being a horror book, I also found the first issue to be surprisingly humorous, such as the scene where a vampire is told to watch his language after taking the lord’s name in vain. How important is humor to this series? I tend to think that if you can make an audience laugh with a character that it's a pretty straight line to their heart. Humor is the fastest way we connect to each other as humans, and if you can laugh with a character, it's just that much easier to cry for them later. And it's also just a part of life. Life is goofy sometimes. Being a vampire is probably hilarious. I mean, not all the time, right? I'm sure back in the old days when you didn't have Amazon delivery or Netflix, or late night diners, or Wal-Mart, being a vampire was probably terrible! But these days? I think it's super-doable. Not great. But you can make it work. Well ...The Bowmans don't seem like they can ... but I feel like I could. I know I'm off topic here, but this actually goes back to an earlier question you asked about why this story stood out amongst other vampire stories. I think that humor, that frank way they all speak and behave is a big part of why (I think) it works as something new. These vampires aren't your typical vampires ... which sounds like a huge cliche, right? But they aren't pretty, or well-spoken or connected to the secret vampire covens or any of that crap. Hell, they're barely interested in being vampires. They don't even really know the rules! They're just good simple people who want the same things we do. They want peace, and they want to be safe. And yeah, they want to drink beer and tell jokes. How did you find your art team of Lisandro Estherren and Dee Cunniffe, and what made them the right ones to tell the Bowmans’ story? That's one of the great parts about working for Skybound. Which is, everyone wants to work for Skybound! So yeah after the book was greenlit Jon Moisan (series editor) and I just poured through portfolios trying to find the right fit. Lisandro's stuff just jumped out at me as being able to capture that grittiness and grime and the raw emotion we needed. Lisandro draws ugly very beautifully. He was a total no-brainer. Dee and I have worked together in the past on a few projects and I just love his palette choices and his speed! Add in Joe Sabino on letters (which don't get talked about enough, but I think Joe does some really cool beautiful things in this book) and it's a killer team. I'm really proud of this crew. Did he design the logo? The logo and cover design is great. No, our logo was designed by (the amazing) Andres Juarez! In-house design guru at Skybound. And yeah, isn't that logo amazing?! And speaking of Skybound, they have been developing a reputation for horror, thanks in no small part to Outcast and The Walking Dead. Does that add any extra pressure to you to add to that legacy? As to the legacy of Skybound, It's certainly something I'm aware of. The pedigree that comes with that logo on my covers. But it's not something I would call pressure. It's a badge I'm very proud to wear. I'm telling the story I want to tell, exactly the way I want to tell it, and as well as I'm capable of telling it. To me, that's the way you honor that symbol. Is there a set number of issues for the series or is it an ongoing? It's an ongoing! And we are pretty deep into it actually. I just wrapped up the 12th issue script and Lisandro is currently rounding third on the sixth issue. It's a crazy ride. And we have so many stories to tell! How hard is it to clean blood out of a handlebar mustache? The Bowmans actually have a homemade "beer" they like to drink that they affectionately refer to as "Bloodweiser." It's a special combination of cow blood and paint thinner. So yeah, as well as giving a nice little buzz ... the paint thinner helps with the mustache thing too.

Thomas and Counting Crows teamed up for a joint tour last year that included a September show at Cal Coast Credit Union Open Air Theatre at San Diego State University. Now, Matchbox Twenty and Counting Crows are teaming up for their joint A Brief History of Everything Else 2017 tour. It opens July 12 in Spokane, concludes Oct. 1 in Dallas and includes a July 28 date at Mattress Firm Amphitheatre (the venue formerly known as Sleep Train Amphitheatre) in Chula Vista. All of the dates and cities appear below. “To be honest, we took a vote after last year and decided to spend every summer with Rob from now on,” Counting Crows’ singer Adam Duritz said in a statement released Monday. “Can. Not. Wait.” Thomas, in his statement, seems to be holding out an olive branch to his band mates in Matchbox Twenty, which this year celebrates its 20th anniversary and has not released a new album since 2012. “No matter what I will ever do, nothing feels like home as much as playing these songs with these guys and it never will, “ Thomas said. “And I can’t wait to spend another summer out there on the road with the Crows.” A ticket pre-sale begins Tuesday for Matchbox Twenty club members, followed by a Wednesday pre-sale for Citi card holders and several other pre-sales. Tickets to the general public go on sale Friday at 10 a.m. through ticketmaster.com and livenation.com, and by phone at (800) 745-3000. Tickets for the Chula Vista show are priced between $29.50 and $99.50 each, plus service charges.

By Sarmistha Acharya March 27, 2017 16:21 BST Close In a related video - Amazon Go: Tech giant unveils checkout-free stores Amazon Amazon is exploring the possibility of opening stores to sell things like furniture and home appliances. Just like any other high street stores, customers visiting Amazon's new shops will be able to view and purchase items, then take them away or have them delivered to their homes. But what is set to make Amazon's stores unique, according to people with knowledge of the matter, is the use of augmented or virtual reality, allowing customers to view the appliances and how they would look in their homes before buying them. In addition to that, the company is also planning to launch an electronics store, similar to Apple's retail stores. These shops will have Amazon devices like the Echo smart speaker and the Prime Video streaming service. As for groceries, Amazon is also looking into how a store could serve walk-in customers and act as a delivery and collection depot for home deliveries. "We are always thinking about new ways to serve customers, but thinking is different than planning," Drew Herdener, a spokesperson for Amazon told the NYT. Amazon is expected to open its first two grocery pick-up stores in Seattle's Ballard and SoDo in the coming weeks. A source told the NYT that Amazon has been developing technology that could detect when a customer pulls into the car park so that orders can be brought to them quickly. A number of retailers including Walmart, Kroger and others are experimenting with the click and collect approach for shopping. Amazon considers opening VR-equipped stores to sell homewaresReuters/Pascal Rossignol The company is testing Amazon Go, a store concept that would stock drinks, sandwiches and other meals. The company is currently fixing glitches with the service and has plans to launch Amazon Go in later in 2017. Amazon has also explored a larger grocery store format, according to internal document reviewed by the NYT. The store could stock fresh produce and meats, as well as frozen foods, cereals and other items. Some products would be kept behind a partition, the internal Amazon documents explain, with employees (not robots) collecting them when requested by shoppers, similar to home petrol stations operate late at night when the door is locked. Amazon Go is expected to be launched in UK and several other US cities by 2018, around the same time as when the company hopes to launch five more US-based AmazonFresh Pickup locations. Amazon is targeting consumers in India, which is dominated by street bazaars, for its bricks and mortar grocery stores. It hopes to open its first Indian grocery store in Bangalore. It said in a statement it was excited by the Indian government's efforts to encourage foreign investment in a "stronger food supply chain." "We have sought an approval to invest and partner with the government in achieving this vision," Amazon added.

(Public Domain) After reading this article, you will never be careless with your child in a public place ever again. There really are predators out there who make a lot of money abducting children. Some of the children that are abducted are abused, tortured or even killed inside the United States, but many others are quickly sent to the nearest port, shipped overseas and ultimately used for some of the most horrific purposes that you can possibly imagine. So if your child is kidnapped by professional traffickers, there is a chance that your precious little one could end up on the other side of the planet. I want to share with you something that was originally posted by Amanda Cropsey Florczykowski on Facebook. When people read the account of what almost happened to her 2-year-old daughter, they can't stop talking about it. This post has already been shared more than 169,000 times on Facebook, and my hope is that we can get that number to multiply by bringing as much exposure to this story as possible. Unless you have no emotional feeling left at all, what Amanda has shared about what almost happened to her daughter will send chills up your spine: My name is Amanda and I'm a Longview, Texas resident. I'm convinced that our two-year-old daughter was the victim of a potential sex-trafficking scam yesterday. I got in the check-out line at a local store early afternoon. I took my daughter out of the cart and the couple ahead struck up the typical conversation about how "cute your daughter is" and then asked about her age, repeatedly. I initially was understanding of what I assumed was a cultural barrier, but I quickly became uncomfortable with the woman's body language and close proximity to my cart/kids. I picked my daughter up only to have the woman ask if she could hold her. The woman was so close at this point that my toddler reached her arms around the woman before I could really respond. In an instant her proximity finally changed and she backed away. I grabbed back on to my daughter as the woman was saying, "Say bye to mommy"—what an unusual comment to provoke a child to say. The woman resisted returning her when I physically pulled my daughter from her arms. Know their conversation began immediately with me and this all took place over only a few moments. After this couple left, I was really shaken up but still noticed the man a few feet away in my peripheral vision, continuing to stand, by himself, with no groceries, in a closed check-out lane. He faced the opposite direction, but was looking over his shoulder at me; glaring would be an understatement. His eyes did not leave my every move and I confidently matched his stare to show I was aware of his presence. I loudly conversed with the cashier about their security staff and the odd couple that seemed predatory. I'm thankful to Jesus that He alone protected us! I was able to get out and home safely with my family. I've since researched sex-trafficking and some details were precisely my experience. I want to recount those specifics to create awareness in hopes that you can protect your own children. —Abductors often work in groups and position themselves throughout the store. Although it wouldn't appear that these three individuals were shopping together, I am certain this man and couple were a team. —This couple were of East Indian descent and the man was white and covered in tattoos—all were mid 30s. Beware no matter the color, appearance, age or sex. —The couple checked out with two items of little value. Something they could easily abandon. —The woman had alarming proximity to me at times and twice put her hand on my basket. She created one route for me to place my groceries, thus leaving my attention divided between my kids and my task. (I did not place anything on the belt until they left ... FYI.) —I-20 is a prominent sex-trafficking route; Longview included. In fact, the U.S. Department of Justice used the following cities to study sex-trafficking data. Notice the first three. Dallas,TX San Antonio, TX Fort Worth, TX Salt Lake City, UT Buffalo, NY Baton Rouge and New Orleans, LA Independence, MO Las Vegas, NV Clearwater, FL The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (U.S. Territory) —Houston is a popular port where these children are sold overseas. —Abductors often follow you to your car and snatch the willing child they bonded with moments before; all while you put in groceries. —Abductors can follow you home. —The cashier remarked that she thought I knew these strangers. Their body language conveyed that to onlookers, which would make an exit convenient. —I've heard this is happening at Target, Walmart and Kmart; often in the mornings/before lunch. Completely true of my experience, but it could happen anywhere. —Moms shopping alone with kids are targeted. Also true of my experience. —Although rumor says blonde, fair girls/teens are targets, I've yet to find that in my research & my daughter doesn't fit that description. <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=726433907" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=726433907" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement —Additionally, little girls AND boys of any age are targets. The thought of what could have happened is sickening. I'm just like you; a mom, and I hope my experience helps you to be, not fearful, but cautious! 2 Timothy 1:7 "For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind." My resources: http://ourrescue.org http://exoduscry.com (LPD have been contacted with this report.) Many people out there do not understand that this has become a silent epidemic in this country. According to the NCIC, children were reported missing nearly half a million times last year alone... When a child is reported missing to law enforcement, federal law requires that child be entered into the FBI's National Crime Information Center, also known as NCIC. According to the FBI, in 2016 there were 465,676 NCIC entries for missing children. When we are talking about people who would take little children away from their parents and do unspeakably evil things to them, we are talking about wickedness on a level that defies description. Certainly there have always been child abductions, but today parents have to deal with things that parents a couple of generations ago never even would have thought about. Growing up in the 1970s and 1980s, my parents would allow my siblings and me to freely wander about our neighborhood and play wherever we wanted. But in 2017, that would be unthinkable. We live at a time when predators are literally grabbing children right off of the streets. For instance, just consider what almost just happened in Oklahoma. The following is the text of a letter that was sent home to students at one school after one of the students was almost abducted: This letter is to make you aware of an incident that occurred last evening in the Twin Oaks addition near Washington Irving Elementary, but not far from some West Field subdivisions. An Edmond student reported that at about 7 p.m. in the 1400 Block of NW 183rd St, a man in a dark colored SUV pulled up to her on the street and made a motion for her to get into the vehicle. The man did not get out of the SUV or make an attempt to touch the student, but because his motive was unclear, we felt it important to bring to your attention. A report of the incident has been filed with Oklahoma City Police. Teachers have been made aware of this incident as well and have been asked to be extra vigilant and watchful on duty as always. Please review safety procedures with your child (especially those who walk home or ride the bus), and if you see anything suspicious, report it to the Oklahoma City Police Department. Instead of endlessly talking about politics, the mainstream news should spend a lot more time focusing on things like this that really matter. And we should push for laws that will ensure that predators and traffickers that victimize children get locked up permanently. Having a child abducted is one of the most horrifying things that can ever happen to a parent, and my hope is that our national leaders will start to take this issue a lot more seriously.

Murdoch University plant disease researcher Kirsty Bayliss developed the chemical-free treatment for fresh produce that increases shelf life, prevents moulds and decay, and reduces wastage. “Our technology will directly address the global food security challenge by reducing food waste and making more food available for more people,” Dr Bayliss said. “The technology is based on the most abundant form of matter in the universe: plasma. Plasma kills the moulds that grow on fruit and vegetables, making fresh produce healthier for consumption and increasing shelf-life.” After working on preliminary trials for the past 18 months, the team is now preparing to start scaling these up by working with commercial food producers. Dr Bayliss will travel to San Francisco later this month after being selected by the Nasa-founded innovation platform Launch as part of an annual food innovation challenge it organises. She said that this was a huge opportunity: “I will be presenting our research to an audience comprising investors, company directors and CEOs, philanthropists and other influential people from organisations such as Fonterra, Walmart, The Gates Foundation, as well as USAID, DFAT and even Google Food!  “What is really exciting is the potential linkages and networks that I can develop; already Nasa are interested in our work!” The technology will also kill bacteria associated with food-borne illnesses, including salmonella and listeria.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Go time By Bernie Becker 03/27/17 10:00 AM EDT With help from Aaron Lorenzo and Colin Wilhelm TAX REFORM, YOUR TIME IS NOW: Tax reform has been the subject of a lot of chatter in recent years — remember when the grand bargain was just around the corner? But now, the push to overhaul the tax code is the top item on Washington’s agenda, perhaps in a way it hasn’t been since the system was last revamped in 1986. So buckle up, you guys. Story Continued Below What’s next? House Republicans are going to start huddling over tax reform on Tuesday morning, according to Rep. Kenny Marchant of Texas, a GOP tax writer, though tax reform text still isn’t expected for weeks and Republicans sound willing to take a more methodical pace on taxes than they did with health care. Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) said, if nothing else, going through the health care process was a good lesson to House Republicans about the restraints caused by Senate budget reconciliation rules. “Those same guardrails, just applied differently, will be present in tax reform,” Brady said. He added that he doesn’t expect any industry-specific carveouts to the border adjustment framework in the House tax reform blueprint, and brushed aside the idea that Republicans would drop the reform part and just end up cutting taxes — an outcome that a fair number of people see as the most logical end game. A couple other things to watch for: How involved will the White House get on tax reform? Top Trump administration officials are suggesting they’ll be more involved than they were on health care, and that they’ll be more willing to reach out to Democrats to reach their policy goals. (Brady, for his part, told Fox Business on Sunday that it “wouldn’t make sense” for the administration to roll out their own tax bill.) And Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said Sunday that conservatives don’t think that tax cuts need to be offset. (Refer back to Brady’s statements on reconciliation on that one.) No, this is harder! Honestly, it’s probably a little silly to argue about whether remaking the American health care system or rewriting the tax code is harder — they’re both plenty hard, which is why Obamacare took over a year to write and pass and tax reform hasn’t happened in three decades. But top administration officials — see Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin just on Friday, for instance — are certainly making the public case that taxes will be easier. Our colleagues at Playbook have a good case for why tax reform is harder, noting in particular the disagreements over the House’s border adjustment proposal and all the moving parts in the tax code that have staunch (and at times well-paid) defenders. A Senate GOP aide made a similar point to The Wall Street Journal, pointing out that seven years of debate over the Affordable Care Act gave Republicans a lot more common ground than the more limited discussions over taxes. One of the arguments for tax reform being easier — it’s “less visceral,” as Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.), a House Ways and Means member, put it. What did Paul Ryan say? For tax reform watchers, Speaker Paul Ryan’s most important statement on Friday might have been about how coming up empty on health care made tax reform harder. "It's about a trillion dollars. That just means the Obamacare taxes stay with Obamacare. We're going to fix the rest of the tax code,” Ryan said. That’s a pretty clear statement that Republicans plan to silo off Affordable Care Act taxes when trying to overhaul the code. (Brady said much the same thing in his Fox Business interview.) The potential caveat there: The tax reform process has a long way to go, so it might be premature to write Ryan’s statement down in stone. Plus, Republicans really hate those ACA taxes — like that 3.8 percent tax on items like capital gains and dividends for higher earners — so are they all going to be fine with not even talking about repealing them? But assuming Ryan’s statement holds, it probably means that all the stories about how repealing Obamacare would set tax reform up with a more favorable baseline were a tad overstated. (And to be clear, few people were making that case harder than Ryan.) Simply put, that’s because Republicans wouldn’t be seeking to get rid of any of the Obamacare taxes that would have led to the lower baseline for tax reform. “If the ACA taxes are left alone, tax reform is no harder than it would have been if ACA repeal had happened,” the Tax Foundation’s Kyle Pomerleau told Morning Tax, adding: “Overall, I think the ‘failure to do ACA reform makes tax reform harder’ narrative is being oversold.” Now, some tax experts did say over the weekend that keeping the Obamacare taxes could have some more indirect effects or impacts on the margins in the tax reform debate. “For example, cutting top labor and capital income tax rates would probably cost less because the elasticity (i.e., responsiveness of income to tax rates) is bigger at higher tax rates,” the Urban Institute’s Len Burman said.

Read more: http://bit.ly/2nau2AB ** BACK FOR MORE BORDER BATTLES: The groups at the center of the battle over the border adjustment framework — the American Made Coalition on the pro side, Americans for Affordable Products on the anti side — didn’t waste much time after the American Health Care Act was pushed aside. The American Made Coalition is out with a new video showing off current and former corporate executives who support border adjustability, after opponents rolled out a similar video last week. (The executives include the former CEOs at Best Buy and Walmart, retailers that all oppose the House plan.) Americans for Affordable Products, meanwhile, is out with a release noting that it now has more than 400 members. For whatever it’s worth: Brady has taken to saying that it’s a matter of when, not if, on border adjustability. MORE ON THE TRUMP FACTOR: This will be something to watch as tax reform moves forward — our Colin Wilhelm notes that probably the two most controversial parts of the House tax reform blueprint, the border adjustment and the proposal to get rid of the deduction for business interest expenses, would have a direct impact on the businesses of the president and his family. Both Donald and Ivanka Trump have clothing lines that would be affected by a border adjustment, and both the president and Ivanka’s husband, Jared Kushner, have a stake in commercial real estate companies — a field where racking up debt is pretty common. “The fortunes of the White House were in large part built using that provision,” one GOP tax lobbyist told Colin. MOVING ON: The House Ways and Means Committee is holding its first markup after the health care defeat on Tuesday — and the bill the panel will be working on might surprise you. The committee will consider the proposal from Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) that seeks to use the Ways and Means chairman’s power to publicize President Donald Trump’s tax returns. Why consider a bill that Brady has said would weaken the protection of civil liberties? Basically, if Ways and Means acts on the bill — and that could mean passing it, or reporting it out unfavorably or with no recommendation — then only Brady or someone of Brady’s choosing can bring the measure up on the floor, according to someone with knowledge of the process. So in short: The markup allows Republicans to block Democrats from calling up the tax return bill. IT’S ALL OVER: April Fool’s Day will officially be the day that the online shopping giant Amazon will collect sales taxes everywhere in the U.S. — well, at least in those places that have a sales tax. Amazon will start charging sales tax to customers in Hawaii, Idaho, Maine and New Hampshire at the end of this week, CNBC reports. (Five states — Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon — don’t have a sales tax.) It’s not really related to taxes, but this New York Times piece also illustrates how Amazon was bound to be collecting sales tax all over eventually. INTERNATIONAL UPDATE THAT’S ODD: The Associated Press examined Indiana’s decision to offer incentives to Carrier not to move jobs to Mexico, an agreement widely cited by Trump as proof that his administration was reversing the tide of jobs leaving the U.S. The findings: “The deal brokered by President Donald Trump to stem job losses at a Carrier Corp. factory in Indianapolis is unusual for the state of Indiana as it offers $7 million of incentives to a company still planning to cut about a third of its some 1,600 jobs.” STATE NEWS TAX REFORM IS HARD, A MICROCOSM: California hands out about $55 billion worth of tax breaks, which is equal to almost half the state’s general fund, The Los Angeles Times’ John Myers reports. And as happens on the federal level, state lawmakers have a lot of proposals to expand that number, including new incentives for teachers. Almost every state has to balance its budget, unlike the federal government. But another problem on both levels is this — the really expensive tax breaks are generally pretty popular, too. “Top of the list in the most recent annual review by the California Department of Finance was the tax-free status of employer health benefits. The report concludes that alone is worth $5.8 billion. Other popular but costly laws exempt home mortgage interest and Social Security benefits from taxation.” IT’S HARD IN THE STATES TOO, CONT’D: Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana won’t be releasing details of his tax reform plan today, as previously expected, and will instead take at least another couple of days before briefing the public, the Baton Rouge Advocate reported. “Edwards is still planning to propose replacing the state tax on corporate income with a corporate tax on sales known as a gross receipts tax. That proposal, something of a surprise given that it was not among the recommendations of a blue-ribbon task force on tax reform set up by Edwards, has gotten a cool reception so far.” QUICK LINKS The internal Trump administration battles between conservatives and the Goldman Sachs wing has popped up at the Treasury. Judge sides with New York City and New York State over UPS in untaxed cigarette case. DID YOU KNOW? The Amazon River is more than 4,000 miles long — or about the distance from New York to Rome. ** A message from Intuit Tax and Financial Center: With bipartisan support from Congress, the IRS and the tax preparation software industry, the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Free File programs help taxpayers in need of assistance to prepare and file their taxes for free.

Soon after, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer bragged about the news from the briefing room podium, and the White House’s communications office sent out a press release, pointing to the news as proof of a president who’s “delivering on jobs for the American people.” Just on the surface, this entire approach makes Trump appear more like a mayor than a president. It’s a massive country with the world’s largest economy, and individual companies are going to sometimes hire and fire people. Trump seems to think he can claim credit for every piece of positive economic news, which is plainly silly. But in the case of Charter Communications, it’s actually worse, because as the Washington Post noted, these jobs were actually announced in the Obama era, and had nothing to do with Trump. [P]arts of that pledge by Charter chief executive Tom Rutledge had already been made months ago…. [T]here is little evidence to suggest the Trump administration played a major role in securing those commitments. Charter had announced those intended hires as far back as October, and the jobs – which will largely be filled by customer service workers – are “new” only in the sense that they have yet to be filled. Oh. So the jobs Trump is pretending to create were actually announced before the election, when Obama was in office. Trump is trumpeting the hires now, hoping to take credit for jobs he had nothing to do with, while simultaneously hoping the public won’t know the difference. Worse, this keeps happening. We saw this same thing unfold a couple of weeks ago, for example, when Trump sought credit for oil-industry jobs that were announced under Obama. A fact-check piece from the Washington Post noted, “Trump’s bravado on these jobs announcements is becoming a bad joke.” The piece highlighted a series of jobs announcements – from Ford, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Walmart, Intel, Lockheed Martin, Softbank, Sprint, and Alibaba – in which the president sought credit for developments he not only had nothing to do with, but also, in most instances, pointed to Obama-era news. When asked how he thinks his presidency is going, Trump couldn’t be more impressed with himself. He recently gave himself a grade of “A” for his “accomplishments,” pointing specifically to his jobs record: “I brought Ford back from Mexico. Ford was going with a massive plant. I brought Fiat in.” Except, he didn’t. Trump’s accomplishments are Obama-era successes, which the previous president didn’t feel the need to brag about. Maybe, at some point, the Republican will have earned the right to brag about his record, but in the meantime, Trump would probably be better off working than bragging about developments he had nothing to do with.

REUTERS/Maxim Zmeyev/Illustration By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear a bid by retailers to revive a $7.25 billion antitrust settlement they reached with Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc over claims the card networks improperly fixed credit and debit card fees. The high court left in place a 2016 lower court decision that threw out the settlement on the basis that it was unfair to retailers that stood to receive no payments and derive no other benefits. The brief Supreme Court order noted that Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito did not participate in consideration of whether to take up the appeal. No reason was given. The settlement had been intended to resolve claims that merchants were overcharged on interchange fees, or "swipe fees," when shoppers used credit or debit cards, and were barred from directing customers toward cheaper means of payment. The deal had been the largest all-cash U.S. antitrust settlement, although its value shrank to about $5.7 billion after roughly 8,000 retailers "opted out." The New York-based 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals found that the accord was unfair to retailers that stood to receive no payments and, in the court's view, little or no benefit at all. It also decertified the case as a class action. The circuit court's decision was a blow to the credit card industry, which hoped the settlement would end a decade of litigation brought on behalf of about 12 million retailers against Visa, MasterCard and banks that issue their cards. Companies including Amazon.com Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc opposed the settlement and challenged it on appeal. Card issuers American Express Co and Discover Financial Services also objected to the settlement. A federal judge in Brooklyn had approved the settlement in 2013, saying it offered significant damages and meaningful protections against future harm. Many retailers and trade groups objected. Some said the payout should have been higher while others said the settlement would have made it too difficult to sue Visa and MasterCard. According to the National Retail Federation trade group, retailers pay roughly $60 billion annually in swipe fees, which typically average around 2 percent. Card-issuing banks would have funded much of the settlement. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp had estimated they were responsible for roughly one-fifth and one-tenth, respectively, of a payout.

(Jeff Piorkowski/special to cleveland.com) Print Email Jeff Piorkowski/special to cleveland.com By Jeff Piorkowski/special to cleveland.com Sun News Email the author on March 27, 2017 at 9:43 AM comments Famous Footwear has opened at Oakwood Commons in South Euclid.Jeff Piorkowski/special to cleveland.com  SOUTH EUCLID, Ohio -- Springtime weather has businesses, like plants in a garden, seemingly popping up throughout South Euclid. "It's a very busy time," said Economic Development Director Michael Love of the business action taking place in the city. That action includes businesses moving from other communities to South Euclid, and others opening their doors for the first time in the city. Many of the newcomers have opened already, or are about to do so at Oakwood Commons, off Warrensville Center Road. Dentist Dr. Dina Fixler opened her newly constructed 4,455-square-foot building Feb. 22 at the former site of Young Israel Temple, 14141 Cedar Road. The new, one-story building is located across the street from University Heights'  Waterstone Building, where Fixler began her practice four-and-a-half years ago. "It's been great," Fixler said of her new facility. "It's been busier. We're more visible on the street in our own building. There's been more walk-in traffic." Fixler said she expects to add a second dentist to the building within a couple of months. "We're blown away by it. It's a very beautiful building, if I can say so. We enjoy working there." Love said that the remaining eight-tenths of an acre at the site is up for sale. Meanwhile, Marc Muskal has relocated his business, Supreme Window & Glass, to 4298 Mayfield Road, next door to Spoto's Bar & Grille. Founded in 1962, Supreme Window had been located on South Taylor Road in Cleveland Heights. It installs new windows and performs glass repair. "I think it is an upgrade moving to a location with more visibility and traffic on Mayfield Road," said Muskal, who bought the building formerly occupied by B&K Bicycle. The storefront, which had been vacant for about a year, has recently been divided and Supreme Window will occupy 6,500 square feet, while Muskal is seeking a business to rent the remaining 1,500-square-foot space. "We're a family business and are family operated," Muskal said. The store is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Friday, and from noon to 3 p.m. Sundays. Call 216-371-3337. At Oakwood Commons, the new 94,000-square-foot building just south of Walmart has been completed. It has already welcomed tenant Famous Footwear, which opened March 16, and which is planning a grand opening April 1. Also opening or about to open in the building will be TJ MAXX/Home Goods and, Burlington. Coming soon is Payless ShoeSource. Oakwood will also soon welcome among its total of 290,000 square feet of storefront space Moe's Southwest Grill. "Moe's should be open within the next month," Love said. Moe's, a fast-causal restaurant with more than 600 locations across the United States, will be located in another just-completed building south of the recently opened, 5,000-square-foot Steak 'n Shake. "There's room for two other tenants in the (Moe's) building," Love said. "They're (owner First Interstate Properties) looking for tenants for the building." Also coming to Oakwood, and expected to start construction late this year or early next year, is Season's Kosher Market. Season's will open its first store in the Cleveland area at Oakwood. It is a chain grocery store with four stores in New York City and one in suburban Baltimore. "There's still room for one more outparcel building on the northern end (of Oakwood Commons), along Warrensville Center Road," Love said. "There are currently no plans to start building it. They're still looking for a tenant." And, Love said, there is still more. "Planet Fitness should start construction at Cedar Center (North) soon," he said. "They're building a 20,000-square-foot building." It was announced in December that Planet Fitness will construct its flagship location in South Euclid. The workout facility will also include Planet Fitness's offices. The city sold for $1 million 1.8 acres of property it owned at Cedar Center to Planet Fitness, which will build behind the Bob Evans restaurant, and next to Gordon Food Service (GFS). Finally, the Mayfield/Green project is under way on the northeast corner of Mayfield and Green roads. Love said the new Marc's store should be opening in late July or early August. The Marc's building, at 60,000 square feet, will also be home to Subway, Great Clips, an AT&T store and Pet Valu, all of which will open at the same time as Marc's. At the end of April, Marc's, 4499 Mayfield Road, and all of the stores in the Marc's plaza, will close. "During that time, Marc's will have a trailer on the site to serve as a temporary pharmacy," Love said. The current Marc's plaza will be demolished and DeVille Development will build two outparcel buildings in its place. Love said the former Burger King building behind Key Bank, 4461 Mayfield Road, will either be torn down or fully rehabilitated for future, unspecified use. "If it is rehabbed," Love said, "it will look totally different. You won't be able to tell what it was before."

Winners of the award – like the Otis Spunkmeyer Chocolate Chunk Cookie and the Otis Spunkmeyer Iced Lemon Loaf Cake – were carefully evaluated and tested by a panel of industry experts and family testers. “We’re so excited to have won this award as it’s parent and kid tested, and approved!” said Charice Grace, Brand Manager of Otis Spunkmeyer. “Our delicious sweets are made with No Funky Stuff – meaning we are free from artificial colors, flavors, and ensure our recipes taste as home-made as possible, while still being a convenient option in the snack aisle.” The Otis Spunkmeyer retail line has 20 individually wrapped tasty treats to choose from including snack cakes, loaf cakes and cookies. Information on the winning foods include: Chocolate Chunk Cookie: The signature Chocolate Chunk Cookie got a makeover last year and joined the new “No Funky Stuff” retail line.

SRP $3.49-4.49. “This Chocolate Chunk Cookie tastes like a cookie I’d share with my child. So often packaged sweets have additives that make it taste fake. Our product testers found this tastes homemade,” says NAPPA Project Manager, Carolyn Richardson. “Families respect the NAPPA seal because they know we will give them honest feedback from both parents and experts about things they will see in the aisle at the grocery store.” Otis Spunkmeyer is available at grocery stores nationwide including Walmart, and sold online via Amazon Fresh.

Christened the Kumasi City Mall, the facility was constructed at a cost of $95million. It is Atterbury’s fourth successful retail mall in Ghana, following on the heels of a trio of developments in the country’s capital Accra. Atterbury said the mall, with potential for a future 10,000m² expansion, would give the city of Kumasi its first one-stop environment with shopping and entertainment under one roof when it opens on April 20. Kumasi City Mall’s anchor tenants are Shoprite and Walmart brand Game Stores, with a retail mix including food, convenience, banking, services, fashion, electronics and a cinema, club and children’s games for entertainment. The facility will be managed by AttAfrica, who would be responsible for its day-to-day running and operations. Cobus van Heerden, retail director at Atterbury Property Development, told the African News Agency that this was the first big development the company had undertaken in Kumasi.

But Trump isn’t officially placing his magic marker scrawl on a resignation. It’s just that, after two whole weeks of trying to get a health care bill passed, he’s tired of all this talking to people and trying to make compromises. So it’s time to shake up America. President Trump plans to unveil a new White House office on Monday with sweeping authority to overhaul the federal bureaucracy and fulfill key campaign promises — such as reforming care for veterans and fighting opioid addiction — by harvesting ideas from the business world and, potentially, privatizing some government functions. Because, as the old saying goes, if at first you don’t succeed, sell it off. The fact that government is not anything at all like business, has never bothered Republicans. So it’s not unexpected that Trump might implement a WWWD (What Would Walmart Do) program. It’s also not unusual for president’s to hand off some executive branch re-think to vice-presidents. Jimmy Carter did a lot to empower the office of VP, giving Walter Mondale a role that was greater than just figurehead. Bill Clinton explicitly aimed Al Gore at streamlining government processes. Joe Biden routinely took on major assignments, from implementing the stimulus package to directing resources against cancer research. And Dick Cheney … yeah. So for Trump to hand over the task of reorganizing the executive branch to Mike Pence would make some sense. Except, it’s not Pence. The White House Office of American Innovation, to be led by Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, will operate as its own nimble power center within the West Wing and will report directly to Trump. While Donald Trump is anxious to destroy existing offices and departments, he’s creating a brand new one, to be lead by his 36-year-old son in law, a man who has never held elected office, never stood for Senate review, and who isn’t screened out by nepotism laws because … no one knows why. Viewed internally as a SWAT team of strategic consultants, the office will be staffed by former business executives and is designed to infuse fresh thinking into Washington, float above the daily political grind and create a lasting legacy for a president still searching for signature achievements. Trump is apparently convinced there’s only one reason why the Republican health insurance debacle debac’d. It’s not because there was a group of Republicans who are so entrenched in saying “no” that they forgot there was another response. It’s not because the entire Republican Party has been put in place with the purpose of making government fail (and they’re darn good at it) not writing legislation that can pass.  No, sweet Republican harmony failed to settle over DC because the Great Dealmaker’s dealmaker chose to spend last week carving slopes in Colorado. Now that Kushner has come in from the cold, Trump will get him to rearrange all the deck chairs in his regime without having to talk to Congress at all.  In a White House riven at times by disorder and competing factions, the innovation office represents an expansion of Kushner’s already far-reaching influence. The 36-year-old former real estate and media executive will continue to wear many hats, driving foreign and domestic policy as well as decisions on presidential personnel. He also is a shadow diplomat, serving as Trump’s lead adviser on relations with China, Mexico, Canada and the Middle East. This frees up Pence to return to critical appearing on Fox duties, and means that Rex Tillerson can do … nothing much at all. Kusher’s got this. Only, someone may also have Kusher. Because there’s one problem he shares with the rest of Team Trump. Senate investigators plan to question Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and a close adviser, as part of their broad inquiry into ties between Trump associates and Russian officials or others linked to the Kremlin, according to administration and congressional officials. Part of this has to do with that name who was in so many meetings, he’s apparently also part of Trump’s regime, Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak.  Meetings between Trump associates and Russian officials or others linked to Mr. Putin are now of heightened interest as several congressional committees and F.B.I. investigators try to determine the scope of the Russian intervention in the election and links between Russians and anyone around Mr. Trump. Maybe one of the assignments of Kushner’s new SWAT team of business experts could be to organize the line of Trump associates coming in to testify about Russian connections. Just organizing that schedule is going to keep someone busy. 437 Comments Share this article 294 294 294 437 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

Net sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 were $34.8 million, compared to $13.5 million for fiscal year 2015, a 158% increase. For fiscal year 2016, net loss was $0.8 million or $0.01 (basic and diluted) earnings per share, compared to net loss of $7.5 million or $0.11 (basic and diluted) loss per share for 2015. Cash flow provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $6 million, compared to cash flow used in operations of $0.6 million for the same period in 2015.

Jack Ross, chairman and chief executive officer, commented, "Our fiscal 2016 net sales grew by $21.3 million, or 158%, primarily related to organic growth from our brands.

We will continue to evaluate further acquisitions to generate shareholder value through the addition of products that can help improve the lives of customers while leveraging our existing distribution relationships. We expect 2017 to be a very active year on the acquisition trail," said Jack Ross, CEO of Synergy. About Synergy CHC Corp.

Synergy's brands: Flat Tummy Tea® Flat Tummy Tea's uniquely formulated two-step herbal detox tea works to naturally help speed metabolism, boost energy and reduce bloating to flatten your tummy. It's currently sold exclusively online to a global, 20-30 year old female, predominantly American market. Since being founded in 2013, Flat Tummy Tea has grown rapidly, largely attributed to the strength of their branding and their innovative and effective use of social media. Their secret is a very specific process and ROI based algorithm used on various online platforms. To date, Flat Tummy Tea has built a targeted social media following of over 1,270,000, many of whom are now customers. Flat Tummy Tea now has over 13,500 positive written reviews on their website, flattummytea.com or visit their Instagram page. Sneaky Vaunt® Sneaky Vaunt is Synergy's newest brand that just launched in March, 2017. Sneaky Vaunt markets and sells a backless, strapless, stick on, push up bra exclusively online through social media channels.

FOCUSfactor® FOCUSfactor is sold at America's leading retailers such as Costco, Sam's Club, Wal-Mart, BJ's Walgreens, CVS and The Vitamin Shoppe. FOCUSfactor, America's leading brain health supplement, is a nutritional supplement that includes a proprietary blend of brain supporting vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and other nutrients. In December 2012, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued US Patent 8,329,227 covering FOCUSfactor's proprietary formulation "for enhanced mental function." The issuance of the patent marked one of the few times a patent has been issued for a nationally branded nutritional supplement. FOCUSfactor is clinically tested with results demonstrating improvements in focus, concentration and memory in healthy adults. www.focusfactor.com Neuragen® Neuragen® is a topical product that works directly at the site of the pain as opposed to oral products. Neuragen® reduces the spontaneous firing of damaged peripheral nerves. By calming these firings at the source, Neuragen® is clinically shown to reduce shooting and burning pains quickly and without the side effects of orally taken medications. This is in part due to the small lipophilic molecules found in Neuragen® which rapidly carry the active ingredients through the rough outer layer of the skin to the site of the pain. Neuragen® is available over the counter in most local pharmacies either in the diabetic section or the analgesic (pain) section. For more information, please visit www.neuragen.com. Hand MD® Hand MD is the world's first anti-aging skincare line formulated specifically for the hands. Hands reveal a woman's true age and the rejuvenation of the hand has become women's #1 aging concern. Developed by Kara Harshbarger and renowned celebrity dermatologist Dr. Alex Khadavi, Hand MD's extensive clinical trials show significant improvement in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, skin hydration, hyper-pigmentation and radiance. HAND MD launched on QVC and sold out in an astonishing 5 minutes. www.hand-md.com Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are subject to risks and uncertainties.

Beauty expert Jeannine Morris joins us with her recommendations on products to try for your very own Spring renewal. Please enable Javascript to watch this video "Well first of all with spring we have to talk about having bright, trendy manicures, but with that comes gel manicures and nail polish remover and it can do a lot of damage to our hands. So I recommend starting off with spring renewal trying these new finger masks by 7th Heaven. Their strengthen nail and cuticle masks. Now 7th Heaven is a botanical based face mask company from the UK, but now they make these new nutrient infused finger masks that help to strengthen your nails and soften your cuticles. They act like a mini glove for your skin and they act like a second skin on top of your finger. Their infused with macadamia and argon oils and their really easy to use. You put them on individually each finger, leave them on for ten to fifteen minutes, take them off and just massage in any excess serum and your fingers will be soft, your cuticles will be smooth and your nails will be stronger. I like using them in between gel manicures. They also make these soften glove masks, which will help sooth and really heal rough, dry hands. So if you need to take it a step further these are the masks for you. They have Shea butter, soy beans and vitamin E and you just use them the same way you would like the finger masks. All of these manicure must-haves for spring are all under $4.00 at Wal-Mart." "Then of course we have to talk about skin care because with the change in seasons come the change of your skin care regimen. I recommend using something simple, yet effective like Cetaphil. It's the number one dermatologist recommended brand for facial moisturizers and cleaners and they have all these new facial products that I really like. Their daily moisturizer and their rich night cream both include hyaluronic acid, which is a powerhouse moisturizing ingredient. It holds up to a thousand times of its weight in water, so it really plumps up the skin. For a regimen I recommend using their gentle cleanser, which is a fan favorite. It's mild, but effective. Then on top of that their daily hydrating cream. It's lightweight and it's oil free, so it's perfect for springtime. And then at night of course cleanse your skin again, but try using their rich, hydrating night cream. Its a little bit denser and it has provitamins plus olive extract to make your skin really, really smooth. I like Cetaphil because its good for all skin types and especially sensitive skin. As the seasons change you might tend to get sensitivity. You can go to seventhheaven.com to find out more information on the nail masks or to cetaphil.com to find out more about their products."

By Roger Sherman // Mar 27, 2017 // Letter, Opinion Share Share Tweet Print Email Keith Regier, the Senate representative in my district, has two bills in the state Legislature opposing solar and other alternative energy. He states, and this is a direct quote: “Solar energy is fine. It should be market driven, not financed by the rate payers. Solar and wind are weak energy sources that need back up generation” If this invalid statement were true why are some of our largest corporations turning to solar ie: Target, Walmart, Apple, Costco and Kohls, etc. The answer is, the bottom line, it saves money. Utility scale solar is growing at a very fast rate and will over the next several years. Solar and alternative energy are happening, Mr. Regier, why not get on board rather than approve energy sources that contribute to the threat of climate change? The science is there.

Big Blue may be looking to get into the dog whisperer business, with the tech giant  looking to build a drone that can act like dog-sitter and trainer when the owner is away. According to a report from Fortune, the company filed a patent for the drone that can watch over pets. The proposed drone could feed, train, and prevent dogs, cats, and other domesticated pets from damaging the house when the owner is away. The drone would feature various sensors and tools such as a microphone to identify when an animal may be weeping or barking. READ MORE: IBM wins Stupid Patent of the Month Award It could also feature a temperature sensor to check whether Fido is getting too cold and a camera to track pets and see if they are walking into limited zone areas of the house, according to the report. The camera would also help the drone monitor the animal for strange behaviors such as scratching at doors or excessive panting. The drone could also play with the pet using internet-connected toys and issue a vocalised command in the owner’s voice if the pet misbehaves. The drone would also work with other Internet-connected household items, like pet feeders, thermostats, and pet doors. Fortune quoted an IBM spokesperson as saying that the researchers involved with the patent application “saw an opportunity to leverage their knowledge about systems and drones and apply that to the pet industry, which is a multi-billion dollar market in the U.S. alone.” The accelerating pace of drone adoption is pushing several companies to file for patents to carry out various tasks using the easy-to-fly, remote controlled platform. Retail-giant Walmart has recently filed a patent which details the use of drones designed to move products inside stores. According to the patent, an airborne drone will be dispatched to fetch an item located within a retail shopping facility and bring it back to the delivery area within the store. Package delivery firm UPS has successfully tested its first autonomous commercial delivery drone.

In a country where the tradition of grocery shopping is still to go from shop to shop in street-side bazaars haggling over prices, Amazon is planning to open its futuristic grocery stores that will make use of automation and artificial intelligence to do away with long queues at the cashier’s desk streamlining and revolutionising the way urban Indians would shop for groceries in the future. Realising the lofty task at hand, Amazon calls it Project Everest. According to a report by the Economic Times in February, Amazon could make India the second country to have brick-and-mortar stores after opening its fifth bookstore in the United States in Chicago with five more planned for the future. Taking advantage of the government’s FDI policy in the FMCG sector, the Seattle-based company has plans to invest Rs 3,500 crore over the next five years in selling groceries, both offline and online. To further its plans, Amazon has already sought approvals from the government to open online and physical stores to sell food products in India. The New York Times reports that Amazon, which plans to invest ‘billions of dollars’ in the Indian markets will open its first grocery in Bengaluru. Branded Amazon Go, the store will stock food items like sandwiches and beverages and other prepared meals that are prepared by in-house chefs in a kitchen that would be visible from the streets. Interestingly, the store unveiled in Seattle at the company’s headquarters last year uses a mix of sensors and artificial intelligence to detect the items picked up by the shopper and charge them directly without the shopper having to visit the cashier. Also Read: Jeff Bezos, Aspiring Supervillain, Tests Out Gigantic Robot Suit India is a big focus for the e-commerce giant. Owing to the liberalisation of the FMCG sector in the country last year which now allows for 100 per cent foreign direct investment as long as the retailer sells locally sourced and produced food items, both through physical stores and online portals, Amazon now has the potential to disrupt the offline retail space much like what it has done to e-commerce in India. And Amazon has it easy somewhat as other international retail giants like Walmart Stores Inc. have not shown much interest in the new developments. For now, hyper-local grocery delivery services like Big Basket and Grofers rule the roost and Amazon’s plans of expanding to groceries is a threat looming large over them. And it's not just groceries that Amazon is interested in. The Gray Lady reports that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is exploring the idea of opening stores that will sell home appliances like refrigerators and air conditioners as well as furniture. In an attempt to turn Amazon into a trillion-dollar company, Amazon needs to crack some of the impenetrable online markets and furniture and home appliances which consumers are somewhat reluctant to buy through e-commerce without first checking them out physically. Amazon will, of course, bring its innovations over to it. There are plans to make use of augmented and virtual reality to help people see how a table or a refrigerator will look in their homes. In addition, the Seattle giant also wants to open up its own electronics stores, much like Apple Stores, where the emphasis would be on Amazon’s in-house range of products centred heavily around its Echo smart home speaker and Prime Video services. Also Read: Jeff Bezos Wants to Set Up Amazon on the Moon Amazon maintains a strategy of putting all its resources behind something it knows provides big returns. In its ambitions to grow even bigger, the company may well just go all ballistic in expanding into the offline retail sector, something that Jeff Bezos in a 2012 interview to had denied ever being interested in.

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory “Resistance” comes in many forms. In discussions about how to deal with the fear and alarm ignited by Donald Trump, no word has been used more frequently than “normalize.” Democrats and progressives engage in almost daily protest rallies to defy Trump’s agenda. But perhaps the most successful component of the anti-Trump movement has been its willingness to challenge his legitimacy. The popular slogan and hashtag “#Not My President” doesn’t mean that people think the November election results were rigged, but that Trump’s Electoral Vote majority doesn’t translate into a popular mandate and that his views and policies don’t reflect the popular will. The anti-Trump movement refuses to “normalize” a president whom they view as an authoritarian, even a neo-fascist, who violates that basic norms of democracy and the rule of law. By poking fun at Trump and exposing his narcissism, conflicts-of-interest, and pathological lies, his opponents are undermining his credibility and destabilizing his presidency as much as any marches and demonstrations. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll conducted February 18-22 found that Trump’s job approval rating stood at just 44 percent — a record low for a newly inaugurated president. Only 34 percent of Americans considered Trump to be honest and trustworthy. Just 18 percent said Trump had the proper temperament to be president, while 55 percent ranked his temperament as poor. A Quinnipiac University Poll conducted March 16-21 found that Trump’s approval rating had dipped even further – to just 37 percent. Particularly worrying for Trump is that is support among his base is slipping. In the past two weeks – in the midst of controversies over Trump’s ties to Russia and his claim that President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower — approval among Republicans dropped from 91 to 81 percent. Among white voters it declined from 49 to 44 percent. The support among men dropped from 49 to 43 per cent. The effort to not normalize Trump isn’t a conspiracy. It involves separate but overlapping components that, when viewed together, reflect a powerful effort to withhold from Trump the things he craves most: public approval and esteem. Entertainment: Five nights a week, CBS “Late Night” host Stephen Colbert mocks Trump with jokes that depict him as a bumbling buffoon. Comedians Bill Maher, Samantha Bee, Trevor Noah, and John Oliver taunt Trump on a weekly basis, with no pretense to be even-handed. “Saturday Night Live’s” sketches eviscerate Trump each week, none more than Alec Baldwin’s uncanny impersonation and acerbic barbs directed at the Trump. Trump can’t stand the stings. In December, Trump tweeted: “Just tried watching Saturday Night Live – unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can’t get any worse. Sad.” In January, five days before his inauguration, Trump still couldn’t contain himself, tweeting: “@NBCNews is bad but Saturday Night Live is the worst of NBC. Not funny, cast is terrible, always a complete hit job. Really bad television!” These reactions expose his inability to laugh at himself, a characteristic of all narcissists. This year’s Golden Globes, Grammy, and Oscar award shows included fusillades of scorn directed at the 45th president. Meryl Streep’s six minute condemnation of the president at the Sunday night Golden Globe ceremony—without once mentioning his name—so got under Trump’s skin that in a series of tweets before dawn Monday, he called Streep, who has more Academy Award nominations than any other actor in history, “one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood”— a gesture that revealed the magnitude of his vanity and the thinness of his skin. At the Grammy awards, several artists used their time on stage to rebuke Trump. Pop star Katy Perry, not known as a political performer, debuted a new song, “Chained to the Rhythm,” wearing a white pants suit (in honor of Hillary Clinton) and an armband with the word “Persist” on it (in honor of Elizabeth Warren’s refusal to be silenced by Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell), while telling the audience “No hate!” The hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest performed “We the People” while Busta Rhymes said, “I just want to thank President Agent Orange for perpetuating all of the evil that you’ve been perpetuating throughout the United States. I want to thank President Agent Orange for your unsuccessful attempt at the Muslim ban.” While a sign saying “No Wall No Ban” flashed in the background, rapper Q-Tip joined them on stage holding the hand of a young woman wearing a hijab – a straightforward attack on Trump’s anti-Muslim policies. On Martin Luther King Jr. Day in January, the rock band Green Day released its music video for their “Troubled Times.” It features an animated Trump-like figure wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat while spewing hateful rhetoric, images of the Ku Klux Klan, scenes from the women’s suffrage and civil rights movements, and contemporary protesters holding signs that read “Make America Hate Again” and “No Border Wall.” The video ends when someone pushes a red button and the screen morphs into a mushroom cloud. The Media: In his previous gig as the host of the Colbert Report on Comedy Central, Colbert coined the word “truthiness” not only to mock Fox News’ claim to be “fair and balanced” but also to jab at the mainstream media for trying its traditional “he said/she said” approach to reporting in which all claims are given equal weight, regardless of their validity. Since Trump took office, the mainstream media have become bolder about calling out his lies and distortions. Now, the media is prepared to challenge Trump’s comments that are outright falsehoods. Rather than simply report what Trump says—making journalists little more than transcribers—the media have increasingly questioned the veracity of president’s statements, starting with his claim that the crowds at his inauguration were the largest in history. After Trump said (during a January 11 press conference) that the public doesn’t care about his tax records, the media reported on a new Pew poll revealing that two-thirds of Americans want the president to release his returns. When Trump claimed that he had received more electoral votes than any Republican since Ronald Reagan, the media quickly reported that he was wrong. On January 23, following Trump’s claims that he would have won the popular vote if three million people hadn’t voted illegally, the headline on the New York Times front-page story read: “Trump Repeats Lie About Popular Vote in Meeting With Lawmakers.” In the past, the Times might have headed the article “Trump Repeats Assertion” or “Trump Repeats Claim” but in an unprecedented move, it called a lie a lie. Having broken that barrier, the Times headline writers were free to tell the unmitigated truth. In March, after Trump tweeted that Obama had ordered a wiretap on Trump Tower, the headline in the next day’s Times read “Trump, Offering No Evidence, Says Obama Tapped His Phones.” The Washington Post headlined its story, “Trump, citing no evidence, accuses Obama of ‘Nixon/Watergate’ plot to wiretap Trump Tower.” After the nation’s two leading papers changed the norms of journalism, other news outlets felt more comfortable doing so. The Chicago Tribune and Washington Post have each initiated regular columns devoted to fact-checking Trump’s statements and exposing his lies. The media watchdog site Politifact has been working overtime to keep track of the validity of Trump’s assertions. It has discovered that through mid-March, 70 percent [3] of Trump’s statements were “mostly false,” “false,” or “pants on fire” outright lies. Since Trump’s inauguration, the media has ratcheted up its investigative reporting about Trump’s business empire, his ties to Russia, and the right-wing affiliations, regulatory abuses, and outlandish views of many of his cabinet nominees and advisors. NPR, for example, created a team devoted to covering Trump’s conflicts of interest. Media coverage of Trump’s links to Putin and Russian businesses has put the president on the defensive since he took the oath of office. At a March 13 press briefing, NBC’s Pete Alexander got into a heated exchange with Trump spokesperson Sean Spicer, raising questions about Trump tweeting things without proof “When should Americans trust the president?” Alexander asked Spicer. “Should they trust the president, is it phony or real when he says President Obama was wiretapping him?” Trump’s twitter tirades reveal that by doing its job, the media are getting under his thin skin. At 6:40 am on February 15, for example, Trump tweeted: “The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!” Forty minutes later, he was back on twitter, proclaiming: “Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?). Just like Russia.” Two days later he tweeted: “The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!” The following week he was still fulminating on the same topic: “FAKE NEWS media knowingly doesn’t tell the truth. A great danger to our country. The failing @nytimes has become a joke. Likewise @CNN. Sad!” Sports: But it isn’t only the liberal entertainment and media institutions that are challenging Trump’s legitimacy. In February six members of the New England Patriots said they wouldn’t accompany their teammates to the White House later this year, where the Super Bowl champions will be honored by Trump. Also in February, Baltimore Orioles Vice President John Angelos announced that he would refuse to allow Trump to throw out the opening game ball. This year’s Super Bowl featured commercials promoting diversity and tolerance – a not very subtle criticism of Trump’s attacks on immigrants, Muslims, and others. Budweiser’s commercial eulogized its founder, Adolphus Busch, an immigrant from Germany, who was told, upon reaching this country, that he was “not wanted here.” Coca-Cola’s ad revealed a montage of young Americans singing “America the Beautiful” in different languages, with the tagline,. “Together Is Beautiful.” The ad for 84 Lumber, a little-known construction supplies firm, showed a Hispanic mother and daughter making their way north to the U.S. border, where they encountered a large wall. It’s A 10, a hair-product company, warned viewers that we’re “in for four years of awful hair.” Consumer Boycotts: Some activist groups are directly going after Trump’s corporate allies and even trying to undermine Trump’s own business empire. Last year Color of Change initiated a campaign to persuade corporations not to sponsor the Republican convention. A number of the big firms – including Coca Cola and Microsoft – backed out in response to the pressure campaign. This year, Color of Change, MoveOn and several other groups launched an anti-Trump social media campaign, #GrabYourWallet, which is urging consumers to boycott corporations with ties to the Trump. Its website listed companies owned by the Trumps or that are actively supporting or doing business with the Trump family. It not only targeted Trump’s golf courses and hotels, but also stores that stocked Trump-branded merchandise, including Ivanka Trump’s line of clothing and shoes and companies that advertise on the Celebrity Apprentice television show, that Trump is still executive producer of. This boycott list includes Amazon, Bed Bath and Beyond, Zappos, Bloomingdales, Bon-Ton, Burlington Coat Factory, Macy’s, Lord & Taylor, Dillards, Neiman Marcus, Sears and T.J. Maxx. The #GrabYourWallet activists have also targeted the CEOs who sit on Trump’s business advisory council. The first domino to fall was Uber. A separate online petition sponsored by the Independent Drivers Guild, which represents nearly 50,000 Uber drivers in New York City, called on Uber CEO Travis Kalanick to resign, saying that Uber was built on a “foundation of hard work by immigrant workers.” In early February, for the first time in its history, downloads of Uber’s app on iOS were surpassed by those of its chief competitor, Lyft. A few days later, Kalanick resigned from the president’s business advisory council. The group’s next targets include Disney, Tesla, Wal-Mart, and Pepsi, whose CEOs also sit on Trump’s business group. Yale students, alumni, and faculty are currently pressuring the university to give back a $150 million gift from alumnus Stephen Schwarzman, chair of the private-equity Blackstone Group, who is serving as chair of Trump’s business advisory group. A new online group, Sleeping Giant, targeted consumer-oriented companies that advertised on Breitbart News, the right-wing white supremacist website run, until last year, by Steve Bannon, who chaired Trump’s campaign and is now his chief political advisor. The tech-savvy Sleeping Giant activists created a Twitter account that allowed consumers to send screenshots to companies who might have been unaware that their ads were appearing next to Breitbart’s offensive content. Over 1,000 companies – including Allstate, Kellogs, Air Canada, and Nike — dropped their ads on the Breitbart site. So did AARP, Duke University and other advertisers that unwittingly found that their brand was being promoted on the toxic propaganda site. Closer to Trump’s home, Nordstrom – the nationwide department store – told his daughter Ivanka that it would no longer sell her clothing line. The company claimed that it did so because the brand wasn’t selling, not make a political statement, but the president wasn’t buying it. “My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom,” Trump tweeted in February. “She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!” Mental Health Professionals: The comedians’ ridicule, the Super Bowl ads, the criticism by sports figures, and the attacks on Trump’s corporate allies and his daughter’s own business operation not only contribute to Trump’s declining favorability, polls show, but also drives Trump crazy. Perhaps it is more accurate to say that the constant ridicule directed at Trump brings to the surface or deepens his existing mental instability. In fact, a growing number of major news outlets, as well as the Columbia Journalism Review, have run columns, new stories, and broadcast segments interviewing psychiatrists and other mental health professionals who raise questions about Trump’s emotional health, sanity, and fitness to serve as president. In 1964, opponents of Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater mocked his slogan, “In Your Heart You Know He’s Right,” with a slogan of their own, “”In Your Guts You Know He’s Nuts.” That year, a magazine called Fact published a poll of 2,417 psychiatrists, the majority of whom said that Goldwater was “psychologically unfit” to be president. In addition to the survey, the magazine published 38 pages of psychiatrists’ comments, which including calling Goldwater a dangerous lunatic,” “paranoid” a “counterfeit figure,” and “emotionally too unstable,” as well as saying that he had an “impulsive quality” and a “Godlike self-image.” In response, the American Psychiatric Association revised its code of ethics, saying that it is unethical for psychiatrists to give a professional opinion about public figures they have not examined in person. It became known ever since as the “Goldwater rule.” Since then, psychiatrists and other mental health professionals have been wary of diagnosing presidential candidates and presidents. But this year, many of them decided to break the Goldwater rule and talk publicly about the condition of Trump’s mind. Last month, for example, 33 prominent mental health experts signed an open letter to the New York Times warning that Trump’s mental state “makes him incapable of serving safely as president.” Trump’s “words and behavior suggest a profound inability to empathize,” they wrote. They noted his tendency to “distort reality” to fit his “personal myth of greatness.” The added that “Trump’s speech and actions demonstrate an inability to tolerate views different from his own, leading to rage reactions.” Their letter warns that Trump’s “grave emotional instability” makes him “incapable of serving safely as president.” Explaining why they decided to break from the Goldwater rule, the mental health professions explained that “This silence has resulted in a failure to lend our expertise to worried journalists and members of Congress at this critical time. We fear that too much is at stake to be silent any longer.” The letter to the Times reflects the growing willingness of mental health professionals to make public statements, including interviews with the news media, about Trump’s psychological condition and his fitness to be president. Of course, it is impossible to assess the impact of all this ridicule and lampooning of Trump on public opinion. The accumulation of mockery may simply reinforce existing views of the president rather than change minds. Trump haters enjoy the scorn because it confirms their assessment. Trump supporters ignore the taunts or view them as evidence of the condescension of the bi-coastal liberal elite. But for Americans in the middle, the constant bombardment of anti-Trump satire, investigate reporting about his business failings and corruption, and the exposure of his penchant for lying can only serve to lead them to question Trump’s fitness for the job. One challenge for the anti-Trump resistance movement is to raise the political costs for Republicans who remain loyal to the president and his unpopular policies. Typically, when a president’s poll numbers plummet, members of his party in Congress seek to distance themselves from his agenda. In normal times, Trump’s sinking credibility would undermine his ability to advance his policy ideas and inflict harm on Republicans in the House and Senate running for re-election next year. But, as we’re learning about Trump, nothing about him is normal. Peter Dreier is a professor of politics and chair of the Urban & Environmental Policy Department at Occidental College.

He Can’t Even Repeal Obamacare We just got hard proof that America’s checks and balances are still working. By Francis Fukuyama March 27, 2017 Facebook Twitter Google + Email Comment Print Back in January, I argued in these pages that whatever President Donald Trump’s proclivities toward being a strongman ruler, the American system of checks and balances in the end had a good chance of containing him. Friday’s failure of the Republican attempt to repeal Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act underscores how difficult our political system makes any kind of decisive political action. During Obama’s presidency, House Republicans voted some 60 times to repeal parts or the whole of the ACA, and Trump himself pledged that he would replace it with “something wonderful” on Day One of his administration. And yet it appears the ACA will continue to be, as House Speaker Paul Ryan admitted, “the law of the land.” This happened despite the fact that we no longer have divided government, with the Republicans controlling both houses of Congress and the presidency. The fundamental reason for the failure of the American Health Care Act lies, of course, in the internal divisions within the Republican Party. The bill was extremely unpopular from the beginning due to the fact it would have potentially resulted in 24 million fewer Americans having health insurance, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The Democrats, though a minority, were therefore uniformly opposed to repeal, meaning that the Republicans could afford only 26 defections for the legislation to fail. The hard-line Freedom Caucus in the end could not be badgered or threatened to accept “Obamacare Lite,” coming, as many of them do, from safe, gerrymandered districts. Story Continued Below This is where the mounting number of institutional checks within the American system came into play. Had this vote been held 75 years ago, the powerful committee chairmen in the House, together with the Republican Party leadership, could have corralled these renegades through a combination of bribes or threats. Today, such tools do not exist: Earmarks have been eliminated along with the powers of the committee chairs, and there is too much money from groups outside the control of the party hierarchy. The Freedom Caucus holdouts were much more frightened of a Tea Party challenge in the primaries than they were of either Paul Ryan or Donald Trump. And then, of course, there is the fact that the Republican Party is itself much more narrowly ideological and fragmented than it was in the mid-20th century, making it better adapted to vetoes and obstruction than to actually governing. As Ryan’s ill-fated predecessor, John Boehner, understood, party discipline no longer exists. President Trump came into office seeming to think he could run the U.S. government like he ran his family-owned business, through executive orders. As he admitted on Friday, “We learned a lot about the vote-getting process.” Unlike a parliamentary system, the U.S. Constitution firmly vests most powers in Congress; the president is powerful only to the extent that he can be a cheerleader and consensus-builder in a system of widely shared powers. So, far from being a potential tyrant as many Democrats fear, Trump looks like he is heading to the history books as a weak and ineffective president, hobbled by the same checks and balances as his predecessor. He has expressed regret that he went for health care reform before tax reform, but he will find that the latter is an even further bridge. Should the Republicans push ahead with their border adjustment tax, they will find a huge coalition of powerful and well-organized interest groups opposing them. (Note, for instance, how vociferously Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, home of retail giant Wal-Mart, has expressed his opposition.) Whatever the national interest in lowering the headline rate of corporate taxation, the organization of Congress gives these interest groups the ability to veto any measure affecting their narrow part of the economy. Ditto for an ambitious infrastructure initiative: It is that same Tea Party bloc that will be the most relentless opponents of any effort to spend federal dollars on it. And even if Congress approves, the courts and states will have a major say in how and whether projects are executed: just look at the remaining obstacles to Keystone XL getting built. Trump could end up being a powerful and transformative president under one condition: that he breaks decisively with the Tea Party wing of his own party and pursue bipartisan cooperation from the Democrats. On the infrastructure initiative and possibly on tax reform this is entirely plausible. This would also have been possible with health care reform, had Trump worked sincerely to fix the ACA rather than foolishly demonizing from the start what has proven to be a popular law. I’m not counting on any of this happening, however. Trump’s instinct is to run to his red-state base of core supporters for comfort and adulation, rather than seeking to govern as president of the entire country. Note that he has yet to hold an event in a state he didn’t win. He needs moreover to think carefully about the interests of his working-class supporters, rather than outsourcing policy to conservative ideologues like Paul Ryan—whose ideas would make them worse off. In Latin America, populist presidents shower their supporters with new social programs; our populist president has spent much of his early days trying to take benefits away from them. Moreover, Trump has done so much to undermine trust that it’s not clear the Democrats would accept an olive branch even if it were offered. Their intention to filibuster the appointment of Neil Gorsuch, an eminently qualified jurist, to the Supreme Court is a harbinger of future obstruction for its own sake. It is much more likely that the Trump presidency will continue to hobble along, weakened by its own lack of experience and internal contradictions. I am personally very pleased that the AHCA failed, since I thought Obamacare was a good thing, and I hope Congress will reverse many of the cuts proposed in Trump’s budget. But Americans should not be pleased with an institutional system that privileges small minorities like the Freedom Caucus and makes the search for broad consensus so difficult. This is what feeds demands for strongman leadership in the first place and prevents the country from facing difficult decisions for the common good.

Bangladesh exported €567.97 million worth of denim products to the 28-nation bloc -- enough to secure a 21.18 percent market share, the highest during the period January- June 2016. The headway has been possible because of the millions of dollars that the local denim fabrics makers invested to set up state-of-the-art facilities in their plants. A development that would give confidence to the country's garment sector as it looks to hit $50 billon in exports by 2021. Currently, Bangladesh has 30 denim mills for which investment to the tune of $1 billion was made, said Mostafiz Uddin, managing director of Denim Expert Ltd, a leading denim exporter. The collective production capacity of the mills is 435 million yards a year. Bangladesh could win in the European denim segment not only for the competitive prices, but also for the quality of its products, shorter lead time and better commitment, said another majore denim maker, MS Hasan, director of operations of Amber Denim. Amber Denim invested heavily to acquire a modern denim laboratory for testing and certification, which helped in reducing the lead time. In terms of denim sales, the US and the UK are two major markets of Bangladesh. Almost 70 percent of the population in the US wear denim products regularly, according to industry insiders. An average consumer owns seven denim products at any given time. Over in the UK, one of the largest clothing markets in Europe, each consumer owns an average of 17 denim garments. Bangladeshi entrepreneurs supply denim products to major global retailers including Levi's, Diesel, G-Star RAW, H&M, Uniqlo, Tesco, Wrangler, s.Oliver, Hugo Boss, Walmart, and Gap. The denim sub-sector could play a significant role in achieving the $50 billion export target by the end of 2021, said Mostafiz Uddin, who organises denim expositions twice a year in Bangladesh. According to Bangladesh Denim Expo, the organiser of the exposition, annually 2.1 billion pieces of denim are sold globally. Mostafiz citing data from the Cotton Inc USA said that the global denim market is estimated to grow by about 8 percent reaching $64.1 billion a year until 2020 of which Bangladesh denim export is predicted to touch $7 billion by the end of 2021. 0 YarnsandFibers News Bureau Zünd to demonstrate its digital cutters at Texprocess 2017 The 33rd edition of India Carpet Expo to take off today View All...

Photo by Michelle Stark, Times Food Editor. I don't need to tell you how to make a cake using a box of Duncan Hines mix. If what you're going for is ease and speed, have at it. This week is dedicated to the idea of crafting cakes from scratch — how other bakers, from novices to blogger to pros, do it, and how you can, too. Related News/Archive We Tried That: Professional cake decorating 4 Hours Ago Pie primer: Tips for perfecting pie, plus terms and savory recipes 5 Months Ago Send us your cake stories: birthday, wedding, and everything in between 4 Weeks Ago Cakes can take many forms: layer, sheet, cup. But they all start with the same sort of batter, a comforting mixture of flour and oil and eggs that can be endlessly dressed up. This is where the fun of making that batter yourself comes in: Creativity abounds. It's the same story with frosting. The store-bought stuff is sufficient, even a late-night guilty pleasure straight from the container, but it's not until you make your own frosting that you realize the fullest, most rich version can only be achieved by freshly whipping butter and sugar. It's actually way easier than the cake itself — and a cinch if you have some sort of electric beaters that can do most of the work for you. From there, it's off into the wild world of cake decorating, which you may not be able to master after a few tries but will probably be a lot of fun anyway. Eve Edelheit | Times Chocolate tahini cake with chocolate buttercream frosting Here are some tips: • For layer cakes, the single most important thing you can do is make sure your layers are even before stacking and frosting them. Be aware of this early on; try to measure out the amount of batter you're pouring into each pan, so the cakes are relatively close in size. Wiggle the pan around on the counter before popping it in the oven to make sure the batter is even. After it bakes, carefully pop it out onto a flat surface and assess the top of the cake. If it's too domed or uneven, use a very sharp knife to slice off the very top, so it's flat. Then proceed with stacking and frosting. • A crucial part of cake decorating: Make sure the cake is room temperature or cooler before you begin to frost it. Warm cake will melt the frosting, resulting in a soupy mess. Bake your cakes hours (or a day) before you're going to frost them. Allow them to cool in their pans for at least 20 minutes after baking, then carefully pop them out onto another surface and let them cool completely. Another trick: Put your cake into the fridge or freezer before you frost it. • Use a spatula or other flat kitchen tool to spread frosting onto your cakes and get a smooth design. • Another tip? Get some tips. To achieve the piping, lettering and flowering you see on a lot of commercially decorated cakes, you'll need plastic or metal decorating tips, which are secured onto pastry bags and turn frosting into different shapes. These are available in many stores, from craft stores like Michaels to Walmart and Target. A pastry bag is also worth the investment. Sure, you can use a large zip-top bag with the corner cut off, but pastry bags are lined to allow frosting to flow easily, and you can rewash them for multiple uses. • Always make sure your frosting is at room temperature before you work with it. • If you're considering frequent cake decorating, invest in a rotating turntable, which makes frosting a cake quickly and smoothly much easier. (Without one, a large, flat surface that allows you to reach every corner of the cake is best.) A cake carrier is one of those things that is not essential but makes the process of transportation so much easier. Here are three cake, and frosting, recipes I turn to often when I want to conjure up something special in the kitchen, especially for birthdays or other food occasions. They all rely on pretty standard ingredients and recipes, only with a couple of slight, sweet twists. Chocolate Cake This cake is a terrific way to use up leftover tahini, a problem most people probably don't have, but if you've ever tried to make hummus at home, you know that it's tough to use up an entire container of tahini in one sitting. But don't be turned off by the somewhat foreign ingredient, which is just pureed sesame seeds. It's actually more akin to peanut butter than anything else in your pantry. It marvelously pairs with the chocolate flavor of the cake; the recipe allows the tahini to shine through in all its glory rather than burying it beneath other flavors. You wouldn't necessarily know it was there if you didn't know (important for the picky eaters in your life), but it gives it a little extra something. Every bite contains a bit of chocolate and tahini, and the combination results in a rich, very moist cake. The idea for the pairing comes from food blogger Molly Yeh, who also recommends a tahini frosting in her cookbook Molly on the Range. I went a slightly different way with it, making a standard buttercream instead and flavoring it with cocoa powder and some almond extract. The subtle almond flavor enhances both the cake's chocolate and the nuttiness of the tahini for a stunner of a cake that's innovative and comforting. easy Chocolate Tahini Cake with Chocolate Buttercream Ingredients For the cake: 1 ¾ cups sugar 1 ¾ cups flour 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1 ½ teaspoons salt 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder 1 ½ teaspoons baking soda 2 large eggs 1 cup whole milk 1 tablespoon vanilla extract ¼ cup canola oil ½ cup tahini ¾ cup boiling water For the frosting: 1 cup unsalted butter, softened 3 ½ cups powdered sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract ½ teaspoon almond extract 2 tablespoons whole milk ⅓ cup cocoa powder Instructions To make the cake: Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease and line the bottoms of your pan of choice. In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, salt, baking powder and baking soda. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla, canola oil and tahini. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir to combine. Whisk in the boiling water. Pour the batter into the cake pans or baking dish and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Begin checking for doneness at 28 minutes for round cakes and 32 minutes for a sheet cake. Let cool in the pans or dish for 10 minutes and then remove to a rack to cool completely. To make the frosting: In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, whip the butter until creamy. Gradually add the powdered sugar and mix to combine. Add extracts, milk and cocoa powder and mix together thoroughly. Taste it, and adjust cocoa powder or extracts if needed. It should be pretty stiff and thick. If it's too thin, add a bit more sugar. If it's too thick, add more milk. For a layer cake, level the round cakes and stack them with a layer of frosting between them. Frost the top and sides of the cake. For a sheet cake, spread the frosting on top and cut into squares. Makes one 8-inch layer cake, one 9- by 13-inch sheet cake or 24 mini cakes.

It's also flavored with some freshly grated ginger. If you're not up for fresh ginger, omit the spice entirely (don't go for the powdered stuff, it's too harsh) and the frosting will taste just fine. easy Carrot Cake With Ginger Cream Cheese Frosting Ingredients For the cake: 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon ¾ teaspoon grated nutmeg 2 teaspoons baking powder 2 teaspoons baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 1 ½ cups vegetable oil 1 ½ cups sugar 4 large eggs, at room temperature 3 cups coarsely grated carrots ½ cup chopped pecans For the frosting: 16 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup powdered sugar 1 ½ tablespoons freshly finely grated ginger 2 teaspoons vanilla extract Instructions Heat oven to 325 degrees. Sift flour, spices, baking powder, baking soda and salt on a large piece of parchment paper. In the bowl of a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat vegetable oil and sugar until combined. Add eggs, one at a time, until each is incorporated. With the mixer on medium speed, gather your dry ingredients on the parchment paper in the shape of a cone and start adding the dry ingredients to the wet batter in the mixer bowl. Using the parchment paper helps with keeping the dry ingredients from spilling over the bowl. Stop mixing when ingredients are incorporated. Fold in carrots and nuts. Prep three 8-inch pans by buttering them and placing a round piece of parchment paper in the bottom of each. Pour batter evenly among the three pans. Place pans in the oven and bake for 45 minutes. Allow cakes to cool in the pan until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes. Turn cakes out onto a rack, remove the parchment paper and allow to cool completely. To make the Ginger Cream Cheese Frosting, combine all the ingredients in the bowl of a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Beat until smooth. To assemble the cakes, place the first layer on a cake stand and, using a piping bag without a tip, pipe a thick circle around the edge. Continuing piping concentric circles inside the first thick circle, then smooth with a spatula. Add another layer and repeat frosting until you have three layers. I made the top layer of frosting thicker. Smooth the top with a clean spatula. Makes 1 three-layered 8- or 9-inch cake. Source: honestlyyum.com Share this recipe Almond Cake These mini cakes, also known as cupcakes, are decadent and moist enough that you may not even need frosting. I like them particularly for their use of almond flour or meal, which adds a little something extra to the batter while keeping the recipe relatively simple. The frosting brings a pop of pink and more cherry flavor to these sweet little cakes. easy Mini Almond Cherry Cakes Ingredients For the mini cakes: ¾ cup almond flour or meal ¾ cup confectioners' sugar ¼ teaspoon fine sea salt 2 large eggs Few drops almond extract 6 tablespoons melted unsalted butter, cooled, plus more for muffin tin 3 tablespoons cornstarch 1 ¼ teaspoons baking powder 2 large egg whites 2 tablespoons granulated sugar ¼ cup cherry or strawberry jam For the frosting (optional): 1 cup salted butter, at room temperature 3 ½ cups powdered sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract ¾ cup fresh cherries, pitted and diced, liquid removed 3 drops red food coloring Instructions Heat oven to 350 degrees. Butter a muffin tin. Using a food processor or blender, mix almond flour, confectioners' sugar and salt until powdery, about 30 seconds. Add eggs and almond extract and process until smooth, 30 seconds longer. Pulse in butter, cornstarch and baking powder. Scrape mixture into a large bowl. Using a beater or an electric mixer, whip egg whites until very foamy. Gradually add granulated sugar while beating eggs until stiff peaks form. Using a spatula, gently and carefully fold a third of the egg whites into the almond mixture to lighten it. Then, fold in the rest of the whites just until no streaks remain. Spoon batter into prepared muffin tins and bake for 10 minutes. Remove from oven. Press down in the middle of each cake with a spoon to create a groove, then add 1 teaspoon jam to each well. Return to oven and bake until light brown and a toothpick inserted into cake (not the jam) comes out clean, another 8 to 10 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature, preferably within 8 hours of baking. To make the frosting: In a large mixing bowl, beat butter. Add powdered sugar, vanilla extract and cherries. Beat until creamy. Spoon frosting into a pastry bag and pipe onto cooled cupcakes. Makes 12 cupcakes.

 The 10 things in advertising you need to know today Julien Rath Mar. 27, 2017, 5:08 AM 1,380 facebook linkedin twitter email print CEO cofounder of Instagram, Kevin Systrom. Vivien Killilea / Getty Images Good morning. Here's everything you need to know in the world of advertising today. 1. Brand safe ads are more expensive than standard YouTube video ads. A chart from Enders Analysis showing the illustration of cost and brand safety by online video type shows direct-sold broadcaster video ads are the most likely to be brand safe — but come at the highest cost. 2. Instagram announced it has reached the 1 million advertisers per month landmark. The number of monthly advertisers has grown from 200,000 a year ago. 3. The YouTube ad boycott will have little financial impact on Google, according to notes from RBC Capital Markets and Morgan Stanley. The revenue from display advertising and ads on the video platform make up only 10% of the company's net revenues — and not every advertiser is pulling their spend. 4. Google wants to use Assistant as a way to connect all devices. An engineer for the company revealed Google is experimenting with using voice commands on one device to take actions on another. 5. More US brands suspended their advertising with Google. General Motors and FX Networks have joined the growing list of companies halting their spend. 6. Mattel and ABC are creating a TV show to find its next big toy. The show, to be titled "Toy Box," will be in the style of "Shark Tank," according to Adweek. 7. The "Fearless Girl" statue will stay on Wall Street until 2018. The extension until February 2018 was announced by New York City's mayor Bill de Blasio, the NY Daily News reported. 8. YouTube's own ads are running alongside offensive content. Commercials for the video platform's premium service Red were found running before objectionable content, Adweek reported. 9. Walmart has made move into promotions around sports. The retailer partnered with the promoter of sports entertainment facilities Oak View Group to become the big box retailer of 21 retailers around the US, The Drum reported. 10. GroupM ended a legal dispute with the compliance arm of Ebiquity, Firm Decisions. A trial, over the alleged "misuse" of confidential documents, was scheduled to go ahead later this year, Campaign reported.

For those concerned about societal collapse or impending disaster, two South Carolina lawmakers have a plan. It includes community ammo depots and tactical weapons training. State Reps. Josiah Magnuson, R-Campobello, and Jonathon Hill, R-Townville — both from tiny towns in the Upstate Bible Belt — are in the process of setting up what they call the "Virtue Solution Project," a group that is seeking to either save America or survive a societal collapse, which they both believe is likely coming. The organization is a mixture of religious ministry, grassroots political organizing and disaster prepping. At its core, their movement hopes to save the country by reshaping it to their interpretation of the Founding Fathers' ideals. They are advocating that their followers, and offshoot groups, form their own communities that will no longer have to rely on corporate America or the "tyrannical" federal government. They are encouraging neighbors to support "principled men" — such as themselves — who are willing to nullify laws and court rulings they don't agree with, like abortion, gay marriage, gun restrictions and federal standards for driver's licenses. For their members who are not in political office, they advocate doing their part by finding their way onto juries in order to acquit people charged with crimes they personally believe are "unjust." If that doesn't work, they will have "community preparedness centers," where there will be access to "reading material, tools, food storage, ammo, and more." The centers will be there when the economy collapses, a natural disaster occurs, a foreign nation attacks, the federal debt dooms the country or an electromagnetic pulse wipes out the nation's infrastructure. All are scenarios they have considered. It's also at these "micro hubs" that neighbors and fellow members of their "militia" will be able to learn about spiritual leadership, first aid, farming techniques, renewable energy sources, and setting up "perimeters" and other "tactical defense" strategies. "There's probably going to be a lot of little crises, but there will eventually come a point where there is a major disaster of some sort in our country, in all likelihood," Magnuson said during one of the lectures he gave in the past year and downloaded onto YouTube. "We need to be ready for that, and that will give us an opportunity to have a fresh beginning." Magnuson, 25, was first elected last year. He is already in the process of developing one of these so-called "lighthouses" or "islands of refuge" near Campabello on a roughly 1-acre tract of land just off U.S. Highway 176. He says the handful of other people involved at this point are planning other groups near Pickens, Simpsonville, Charleston and across the border in Georgia. According to documents published by the group online, their long-term goal is to "train and equip one million neighborhood leaders" that are willing to "build a fresh beginning for America." Magnuson said his center in Campobello — an old barn that was purchased by an LLC he set up late last year — will start out as a coffee shop, but will hopefully grow into the vision that he and Hill have developed. "It's serving two purposes," Magnuson told The Post and Courier. "As we build that strength, it prevents doomsday, and on the other hand, if we don't succeed, then this provides, like, lifeboats. "I think all Christians understand that there is a prophetic element to this, living in the end times and so forth," he said. Professors who have studied religion, politics and similar conservative Christian organizations say the ideas behind Magnuson and Hill's plan aren't new. Some aspects of their proposal resembles militia groups in the Western United States. Other material produced by the state lawmakers looks like that of Christian nationalist groups. "The way I would describe this group is the John Birch Society meets prepper-culture, combined with a kind of Christian restorationist sensibility and expressed in a business PowerPoint kind of way," said David Sehat, a history professor at Georgia State University. "That seems to me to sum up the group, which is super weird, also super interesting and super disturbing in some ways." But the oddest part of the entire group, several academics said, is that it is founded by two elected officials, in this case serving in the high halls of the state Legislature. Hill, 32, said people shouldn't read too much into the group's material because they are only in the infant stages of developing their ideas. The point, he said, is not to scare people, it's about self-sufficiency and providing for your neighbors. During the early gatherings of the group that have been posted on Youtube, Magnuson made it clear he is not advocating for an armed insurrection. "We're not saying that everybody should go and pick up guns and go have a revolution," he said. According to their campaign websites, both Hill and Magnuson were home-schooled, and both grew up with fathers who were pastors. Hill is now a self-taught webpage developer, according to his campaign website. He ran the Anderson Tea Party from 2009 to 2012 and was elected to office in 2014. Magnuson was just elected during the recent 2016 election, and studied for two years with Oak Brook College of Law, a school for "aspiring Christian attorneys." The first-term lawmaker was also the founder of several Christian groups when he was younger, including the Young Christian Leaders' Alliance, for which he drafted a constitution. Magnuson also operated a blog where he shared photos of trips to the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Ky. He warned his followers about big businesses like Lockheed Martin, General Motors and Wal-Mart, which he said was "encouraging the progress of the coming union of Canada, the United States, and Mexico." Magnuson and Hill see their "virtuous" communities as the answer to government overreach. Part of their solution is to limit the need for government by having the people in their select communities and churches provide social services instead of the government. In one of his lectures, Hill raises the question of any government role in public education. "There's nothing wrong with education," he said. "We can talk about whether it's government's role to fund that or control that." His idea of public education is a one-room schoolhouse where parents choose the teacher. "That's the way it worked back in the day," he said. "And then we got away from that and now we basically have career politicians and bureaucrats on a school board that are running things. It's no longer the parents." Other members of their group took that anti-government sentiment further. Patricia Wheat, a speaker who took part in their lectures on more than one occasion, raised questions about the legitimacy of state and local police. "Police are employees of a corporation. They are employees of a city. They are employees of a county. SLED officers and Highway Patrol are employees of the state, but they are employees of a corporation," Wheat said. "They only have authority within that corporation, and that authority is questionable as far as I'm concerned." "However, militia have authority under the Constitution of the United States, of the State of South Carolina and the Bible," she continued. "Which one overrides?" Wheat's comments, Hill said, were the result of "like-minded people thinking out loud," and that he and Magnuson found her comments "objectionable." "She would be an example of one of those individuals that goes much further towards anarchy than we are comfortable with," Hill said. On the group's webpage, they link to a commercial for the Peacekeeper app, which allows people to contact their neighbors with an alert if they want them to respond to an emergency instead of police. "This isn't some type of political overturning movement," Magnuson said. "It's more of a political and economic replacing movement." Until their replacement movement takes hold, however, the two lawmakers are working to counteract the current political system in the House of Representatives by trying to nullify laws they determine are unconstitutional or morally evil. Magnuson has sponsored bills that would allow local government to enact laws mandating transgender individuals use the bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificate or would define "personhood" as a fertilized egg, effectively nullifying court decisions upholding access to abortions. On their website, they give the example of a bill that Hill previously helped to sponsor that would prevent state employees from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. On their Facebook page, the group held up the trial of the Bundy Brothers, the armed anti-government protesters who took over a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon, as a good example of jurors refusing to convict people for laws they believe are unjust. "Whether or not you agree with the Bundys, this is clearly a victory for the jury system, and demonstrates its power to protect courageous citizens!" they wrote. While Magnuson and Hill explicitly advocate against calls for secession, several professors said some of their movement's language and ideas are similar to those in the former Confederacy. Michael McVicar, a professor of religion at Florida State University who studied the South Carolina group Christian Exodus during the early 2000s said, "When you start talking about nullification, that old Confederate ideology is just percolating right under the surface."
