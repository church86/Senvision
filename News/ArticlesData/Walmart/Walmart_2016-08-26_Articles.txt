Officers were called to the Walmart on Route 23 at 9:30 p.m. after they were alerted to an alleged shoplifter who fled the store, according to a press release. When officers arrived they saw the suspect, later identified as 27-year-old Wayne resident John Sanchez, run into the back parking lot and jump a fence, officials said.  The area behind the fence has a severe drop of 20 to 100 feet near the Tilcon Riverdale Quarry, according to police. Police said they climbed down a wooded area where they found Sanchez unconscious on his back with broken bones. Emergency responders, including a state police helicopter, were called to the scene to help rescue Sanchez. With the help of the borough's fire department, Sanchez was extracted from the quarry area and was transported to St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center in Paterson by helicopter, police said. Police said his condition was not available Saturday afternoon.  An investigation determined the Sanchez tried to take a cart of merchandise worth $462, police said.

Crunch Network What this month’s Jet.com sale means for the future of retail Posted Aug 27, 2016 by Toby Russell (@toby_russell1) 0 SHARES Next Story Weekly Roundup: Zero-day hacks rock Apple, WhatsApp changes privacy policy Toby Russell Crunch Network Contributor Toby Russell is head of business and product at SHIFT Technologies, Inc., an online automobile marketplace based in San Francisco. How to join the network One in ten retail sales in the United States –- a projected $373 billion in 2016 -– happens online. Forrester predicts total U.S. online retail will grow to $500 billion by 2020. That number will only continue to increase globally as more businesses take core operations to the web. Retailers grasp the web-focused future of the industry, but the sale of Jet.com to Walmart earlier this month has sped up the shift and validated the online marketplace approach to e-commerce. Moving Storefronts Online and Logistics Next Door is a Winning Model With the sale of Jet.com, traditional retail significantly moves into the business of online storefronts with global reach and locally-sourced logistics. The move by Walmart follows years of trying to compete with Amazon’s e-commerce success fueled by a fundamental shift in consumer behavior toward on-demand quality. More importantly, Walmart buying Jet.com and Macy’s decision to close 100 stores in order to boost online operations this month does confirm that the next generation of retail will be dominated by online sales and direct-to-consumer logistics companies. Global retail sectors once defined by brick-and-mortar, face-to-face customer interactions – selling items from electronics to books to automobiles – now need to consider incorporating the online marketplace model originally created by Amazon to differentiate during the dot com boom. Next generation retailers will move away from storing goods in numerous local retail stores and into regional distribution centers. Consumers will browse those goods online and have them delivered directly to them, increasingly on demand, with easy return policies. This means less inventory, more selection and lower prices being delivered to an increasingly urbanizing America where retail space costs are rising and storefronts start to not make business sense. This model helped Amazon capture close to 60% of the U.S. online sales market growth in 2015. Retailers who successfully subscribe to a version of it will be able to capture some of that online sales market share. Retailers who don’t entertain adopting the model risk fading away completely. (Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images)   The Point of Sale is Now Anywhere with an Internet Connection Amazon, Jet.com and other leading online-first retailers create and continue to improve purchase-to-delivery models to reduce backend friction. The resulting supply chain efficiency delivers consumer access to goods at consistently lower costs. In order to succeed in this new environment, new, legacy and smaller companies alike will need to move beyond traditional sales to provide convenient, reliable and on-demand online service to customers looking for their next pair of shoes, suit, headphones – even their next car. Consumers with access to the web can search, find and purchase products from anywhere. They can use the internet and their own connected mobile devices to read product information, survey options and complete purchases. And third party review sites like Yelp and testimonials on company websites and consumer message boards enable shoppers to hold retailers accountable better than ever before. In the near future, retailers will need to incorporate consumer freedom into their sales models to meet the customer whenever, wherever to complete an online sale. Retailers Must Invest in Both Technology and Convenience Driving down the costs associated with buying and selling allows these retailers to spend more on technologies that will connect suppliers with buyers and shorten the distance between point of sale and delivery. A technology-powered focus on finding new products and securing logistics will allow online-focused companies to win over today’s device-wielding customers. Retailers should use the web to target consumers who care less about who delivers the goods, and more about their price, quality and convenience. Facebook did not create social networking. Mark Zuckerberg and his team created technology to do it much better. That’s what legacy leader Amazon and relative newcomer Jet.com have done for retail. They have built web-based models that cut costs for buyers and sellers. Models that other retailers can riff off of. Online marketplaces that allow consumers who value quality and convenience above all to search for goods and services they need from the comfort of anywhere. Walmart took note of Jet.com’s prowess and scooped up a leading e-commerce platform that will help define how the company, and retailers in general, do business moving forward. Online, on-demand and on a consumer’s device screen. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Jet Founded 2013 Overview ​Jet launched with one mission: To become the smartest way to shop and save on pretty much anything.

A federal appeals court is allowing a trade group representing liquor store operators to join a stalled federal lawsuit that the nation's largest retailer filed against the Texas agency that hands out permits to sell booze by the bottle. In trying to crack Texas' restrictions on package liquor licenses, some dating to the end of Prohibition, Wal-Mart contends that some of the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission's rules amount to unconstitutional discrimination. Austin-based U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman had set the suit for trial next month, but everything stopped in May when the Texas Package Stores Association, representing about 2,500 existing liquor store retailers, got a green light from an appeals court to move forward with challenging Pitman's refusal to let them intervene on the side of the beverage commission.

Spec's, one of the state's largest liquor store chains, belongs to the Texas Package Stores Association, a trade group that has received court approval to join the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission in a lawsuit Wal-Mart has filed against the agency that dispenses liquor licenses. Wal-Mart wants to begin selling bottled liquor in Texas but contends it is prevented by TABC rules that are unconstitutional. (AP Photo/Michael Graczyk) A panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Pitman's ruling last week and let the association join the lawsuit, saying the trade group had a "protectable interest that may be impaired or injured" in the outcome. Pitman now must set a new trial date. "On behalf of our Texas customers, we are prepared to pursue the case to provide Texans their freedom of choice," Wal-Mart spokeswoman Anne Hatfield said. Booze is popular in Texas: The liquor industry in Texas generated nearly $14 billion in sales in 2014, the latest annual numbers available from the state Comptroller's Office. And Wal-Mart, with its 574 stores, markets and Sam's Club outlets in Texas, says it's the state's largest purveyor of beer and wine. While the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company sells liquor in 31 states, it's resorted to court actions only in Texas to try to get into a state's liquor market. In its February 2015 lawsuit, Wal-Mart touted it "helps people save money and live better by purchasing quality products at competitive prices." But the Texas Package Stores Association contends the retailing giant wants to "upset the level playing field" and "change the structure of the Texas market" that's existed for decades so the company can make "mass sales of low-priced liquor." The store group contends the initial defendant, the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, was focused on more general issues regulating the alcoholic beverage industry in the state and not specifically on liquor store dealers who "stand to lose substantial revenues and long-term investments and be placed at a competitive disadvantage." TABC spokesman Chris Porter said he couldn't comment on pending court matters. Bills to loosen liquor license restrictions were introduced in the Texas Legislature in the last session in 2015 but never got out of committee. One such rule that mandates that a publicly traded company — like Wal-Mart — can't hold separate beer and wine and liquor licenses; Hatfield said the rule "is counter to Texas' belief in free enterprise and fair competition." Another idiosyncrasy allows publicly traded hotel corporations to sell both beer and wine and liquor by the bottle, which Wal-Mart said in its lawsuit is "nothing more than naked economic protectionism." A Texas liquor license holder also is limited to no more than five package stores, though an immediate blood relative can acquire other licenses and consolidate those licenses into a single entity that exceeds the five-store limit. The effect of that rule is growth of family-owned chain liquor stores in the state; Wal-Mart complains it has "no blood relative" to take advantage of the provision. The five-store limit and the prohibition on holding both a package store permit and a beer and wine retailer's permit go back to 1935, when the Texas Liquor Control Board was created after Prohibition ended. Lawmakers revised its duties and renamed the panel in 1970, and legislators added the publicly traded company ban in 1995 to blunt the effect of a court ruling that invalidated a provision requiring a license holder to be a resident of Texas for at least a year. One restriction not being contested is a ban on liquor sales at grocery stores. A separate building with its own entrance is permitted under the law, and Wal-Mart says it would accommodate that by dedicating a distinct piece of property at stores to the liquor operation.

The incident occurred at about 4:30 p.m. on Wednesday at the Walmart along the 2000 block of the Fruitville Pike in Manheim Township, according to township police. The teenager was part of group at the Subway sandwich store inside the Walmart. "As the group became disruptive, an employee became suspicious that one of the males was armed, and asked them to leave," police said. The group eventually left the store after threatening the employee, but police said they were able to identify the teen with the gun as a Manheim Township resident. The teenager was eventually spotted walking along the 900 block of Olde Hickory Road at about 8:10 p.m., police said. The handgun, which was loaded, was found in the teen's pants, along with a pair of metal knuckles, police said. It was later discovered that the handgun was reported stolen from a vehicle in the township in July, police said. The teen has been charged with terroristic threats, disorderly conduct, receiving stolen property, carrying a firearms without a license, possession of a firearm by a minor, resisting arrest, and possession of prohibited offensive weapons, police said. He was turned over to the Lancaster County Youth Intervention Center.

The deadline to submit grant requests is 11:59 p.m. CST on Friday, Sept. 2. The funding opportunity — which provides grants to 501(c)(3) organizations ranging from $25,000 to $200,000, depending on the type of program — is open to Illinois nonprofits with efforts that focus on hunger relief, career opportunities, education programs, health care access and other human-service programs designed to meet the needs of undeserved, low-income populations. Over the last fiscal year, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation gave $44.1 million to hundreds of nonprofit groups throughout Illinois. The company said in a statement that it seeks out organizations and initiatives that have a long-lasting, positive impact on communities nationwide. Phil Newton, founder of Perennial Partners, a Peoria-based consulting firm that caters to nonprofits, as well as small businesses, said private funding amid the state’s budget impasse is not only welcome, but also vital for many of Illinois’ community-focused operations. “When a company of Walmart’s caliber says it’s going to invest some extra dollars, that helps immensely,” Newton said. “To their great credit, they make a lot of small gifts. They’re not just giving to the larger, more well-known charities, but they’re giving to the local organizations…the baseball teams and the Cub Scout troops.” At this point, Newton said the best survival strategy for community organizations is to “get diversified right now. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, don’t rely entirely on the state. Write grants, do a special event, get involved with what’s called ‘planned giving,’ work on corporate solicitation. That way, you can better weather the times when the State of illinois is not paying its bills.” To be considered for grant support, prospective grantee organizations must submit online applications through the Walmart Foundation State Giving Program website, http://giving.walmart.com/foundation. Applicants must have a current 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status to meet the program’s minimum eligibility criteria.

Now she's expanding her line to include five new pies: berry cobbler, apple cobbler, peach cobbler, apple pecan cake and sweet potato loaf. NEW YORK — Patti LaBelle is making an encore. Her sweet potato pie was a smash-hit last year for Walmart, her exclusive retailer. Now she’s expanding her line to include five new desserts: berry cobbler, apple cobbler, peach cobbler, apple pecan cake and sweet potato loaf. LaBelle’s sweet potato pie hit stores last August, but it wasn’t a huge success until Youtube star James Wright Chanel sang its praises in a expletive-laced video that went viral. “I want to taste Patti live,” said Wright, breaking into song as soon as he dug in. “You turn into Patti after eating this! Go to Walmart and buy the Patti LaBelle pie.” After that video came out in November, LaBelle’s sweet potato pie sold like hot cakes. “We were selling one per second for a while after his video went live,” said Walmart spokesman John Forrest Ales. “He posted that video and we sold out and had to quickly make more, a million pounds.” And it wasn’t just a Thanksgiving thing. Even after the holidays the pies were still selling, so Walmart has been churning them out year round even though they were originally meant to be a seasonal item. “It’s pretty insane that it’s August and people are still buying the sweet potato pie,” said Ales. LaBelle fans may want to brace themselves for a bit of sticker shock, though. While the sweet potato pie costs $3.98, the cobblers are $6.98, the apple pecan cake costs $9.98. LaBelle was not immediately available for comment.

Even after the holidays the pies were still selling, so Walmart has been churning them out year round even though they were originally meant to be a seasonal item. “It’s pretty insane that it’s August and people are still buying the sweet potato pie,” said Ales. LaBelle fans may want to brace themselves for a bit of sticker shock, though. While the sweet potato pie costs $3.98, the cobblers are $6.98, the apple pecan cake costs $9.98. LaBelle was not immediately available for comment.

Food & Dining Patti LaBelle unveils new cobblers, cakes for Walmart -- how do they taste? Patti’s Good Life Peach Cobbler Walmart The peach cobbler dropped off to us had a flat top, which looked fine but did not sport the eye appeal of this undulating landscape of golden brown pastry. The peach cobbler dropped off to us had a flat top, which looked fine but did not sport the eye appeal of this undulating landscape of golden brown pastry. (Walmart) Joseph HernandezContact Reporter 'Shout out to Patti LaBelle, honey!” And with that auspicious beginning, James Wright Chanel’s YouTube love letter to Patti LaBelle’s branded sweet potato pie went viral — to the tune of 5 million views and counting. Put another way, the video was so popular that the pie (sold exclusively at Walmart) was flying off the shelves at the rate of one pie per second for 72 hours. Hoping that lightning strikes twice — or, y’know, 5 million times — Walmart today announced the release of its latest partnership with LaBelle in the form of the Patti’s Good Life brand of pies and desserts. The line features peach, berry and apple cobblers (each $6.98), an apple pecan cake ($9.98) and a sweet potato loaf ($4.48), all available nationwide, starting next week, except the loaf, which is only available in select stores. Here at the Tribune, we got a first taste of everything except the loaf in our test kitchen. Will these inspire more viral videos? Check out our tasting notes below. Patti Labelle's cobblers Walmart Patti’s Good Life cobblers for Walmart include berry (a mix of raspberries, blackberries, blueberries and boysenberries, aka bumbleberry; see our recipe for bumbleberry pie!), apple and peach. Patti’s Good Life cobblers for Walmart include berry (a mix of raspberries, blackberries, blueberries and boysenberries, aka bumbleberry; see our recipe for bumbleberry pie!), apple and peach. (Walmart) Patti’s Good Life Peach Cobbler: Each of the cobblers (all clocking in at just under 2 pounds) list the named fruit on the ingredients list, followed by sugar (not today, corn syrup!). If an attached press release is to be believed, 6.4 million pounds of peaches go into the Patti’s Good Life line; this pie is loaded. A top crust is covered in cinnamon, which is aromatic but actually distracts from the cobbler’s sweetness. Too much cinnamon on the interior turned the tasters off. Not a strong showing on this round. Patti’s Good Life Berry Cobbler: Stuffed with raspberries, blackberries, blueberries and boysenberries, the (bumble)berry cobbler was a favorite for the tasting team. The right balance of sweet to tart, the jewel-toned filling was surprisingly set and not just a puddle of goo — the bottom crust was enjoyably crisp and buttery even as we freed the cobbler from its aluminum pan prison. Plus side? The cobblers are not sold frozen, so they don’t need to be heated to be enjoyed, but heating them through does offer a bit of that “fresh baked” sensation. Patti’s Good Life Apple Cobbler: The texture on the apple cobbler was spot on. Made with Fuji apples, the filling was toothsome yet soft, with a nicer, more balanced mixture of cinnamon and sugar than the peach. The apples have retained a bit of their tartness, which is nice with the pastry crust. Patti’s Good Life Apple Pecan Cake Walmart We liked the cake itself but not the frosting. We liked the cake itself but not the frosting. (Walmart) Patti’s Good Life Apple Pecan Cake: Our team was turned off by the near-impenetrable helmet of buttercream icing and too-rich caramel goo. The cake itself — a Southern-style layer cake of Fuji apples and Georgia pecans — is tasty and would make a good accompaniment to coffee or tea. Just get past the overly rich, heavy-handed application of icing first. Overall, these treats — in particular, the apple and berry cobblers — offer good value and flavor. Not sure if I’d break out into song over these, but I’ll admit that they have their high notes. jbhernandez@chicagotribune.com Twitter @joeybear85         First, we found the best hot chocolate in Chicago.

In 1896, it was S&H Green Stamps. That evolved to double coupons, buy-one-get-one free sales and fuel discounts. As technology advances, grocers realize that convenience and time are prime considerations for customers and will do your shopping for you, provided you give them a list. The latest store to shop for you began operations this week when four Upstate Walmart stores began offering a program that lets shoppers place an order online and drive to a designated pickup parking area at Walmart where an employee will bring the order out to the customer’s vehicle. But they are not the only store that offers shopping for you in the Upstate. In January, Publix shoppers were introduced to the services of a delivery company called Shipt which sends online orders direct to the homes of online customers throughout the Upstate. The Lowes store, which is currently under construction in Five Forks, will features its own version of online delivery shopping service called Lowes Foods-to-Go. These stores are trying to stay ahead in what’s become a very competitive environment. In Simpsonville alone, there are more than 10 full-sized grocery stores and the total continues to increase. A pair of Walmart Neighborhood Markets opened in Simpsonville in 2015 and 2016, respectively, and a Lowes Foods store is scheduled to open in the spring of 2017.

Walmart has launched an online grocery pick up at four Greenville-area store.  (Photo: HEIDI HEILBRUNN/Staff) Convenience is key “We’re looking for our customer base to take advantage of this 100 percent free service,” said Mark Grider, who’s Walmart’s E-Commerce Market Coach for South Carolina. “It’s extremely convenient to be able to make your own orders sitting at home. “You don’t have to worry about bringing your kids in, finding a parking spot or getting through the checkout lines.” In addition to the Walmart website, there’s also an app for the new program. A minimum total purchase of at least $30 is required. Grider says customers call when they’ve arrived during a pickup time they’ve selected, and the order is delivered within five minutes. The new program began Thursday at Walmart Supercenters in Greenville (1451 Woodruff Road.) and Anderson (2003 E. Greenville St.), and at Walmart Neighborhood Markets in Simpsonville (1401 W. Georgia Road.) and Travelers Rest (9 Benton Road.). The program began in South Carolina in April with nine Walmart locations in the Charleston area. It’s also available in six Columbia-area stores as well. Grider said with the program still in its early stages, orders need to be placed a day in advance of pickup. He added that changes can be made to the order by 10 a.m. on the day of pickup. ENTERTAINMENT: Festivals fuel economy LOCAL: Furman to build $1.7M solar farm The pickup service features more than 30,000 items for sale. Grider said those aren’t limited to groceries, which is especially true for the larger Supercenters. “There are a few specific items you can’t order online (for pickup): large, bulky items, TVs, bikes, furniture and most apparel. Tobacco, alcohol and firearms are not allowed (to be purchased this way) in South Carolina,” Grider said. “Outside of that, you can order pretty much anything through the site.” At the Woodruff Road Walmart, there were 25 online orders placed on the opening day Thursday and another 25 placed Friday. One of those customers Friday was Scott Smith, who traveled from his Greer home to pick up various grocery items as well as a couple of air filters. “My wife says I don’t like stores, but I don’t mind picking something up once I’ve ordered it and I’m less likely to buy more things,” Smith said. “So she ordered it all and said, ‘go pick it up.’ I really like the whole concept.” Grider said the lack of impulse buys by online customers was a consideration during the process of deciding to offer the service. He said the positives have far outweighed any negatives. When placing an order online, other recommendations will be presented based on what a customer has selected. Grider said that kind of serves as the impulse item for online. “The fact that we’re offering this level of convenience has increased the number of shopping trips for our customers versus those trips into the store,” Grider said. “In turn, that balances everything out.” Buy Photo Cathy Booker, Walmart department manager, picks produce for an online order Friday. Walmart has launched an online grocery pick up at four Greenville-area store.  (Photo: HEIDI HEILBRUNN/Staff) ‘A life-saver for a working mom’ Shipt’s annual plan costs $99 per year or $14 per month. All Publix grocery items are available for delivery, which is offered on the same day in as little as one hour. There’s no delivery charge on orders of at least $35. Simpsonville mother of three, Kellyn Finlay, began utilizing Shipt soon after it was offered and at a time when she was “very, very pregnant.” Finlay and her husband are both teachers, and their children are ages 6, 4 and 4 months. “It (Shipt) really is a life-saver for a working mom,” Finlay said. “I hate sucking up time on the weekends to have to go to the grocery store. That’s the only downtime we have as a family. “When you’re shopping for five people, a grocery store trip takes forever.” In the weeks before and after her baby was born, Finlay said “it was so nice” to not make one trip to the grocery store. That’s still the case now that school is back in session. “After you’ve been at work all day and you’ve picked up all your kids, the last thing you want to do is go to the grocery store,” Finlay said. “You don’t want to take your kids home, get them settled and go back out to the grocery store either.” Finlay said she especially enjoys the ease of service. She said she can place an order through Shipt’s app on her phone during her planning period at school and have it delivered soon after she gets home. Finlay said if her Publix is out of a brand she ordered, she will get a text asking if she’d like a different brand of the same product. She also receives a text when the order is on its way to her home. In addition to beating the hustle and bustle inside of her local Publix, Finlay said the delivery service also helps her avoid the traffic outside it. “If I don’t have to battle Fairview Road, that $99 a year is worth it to me,” Finlay said.

Grider said it’s an important factor, especially when it comes to choosing produce and meats. “When we bring the groceries out we show the customer every piece of produce we’ve selected,” Grider said. “If we get you bananas that are too green, we will stop and go back and get you more of what you’re looking for.” “This is just where the businesses are going. E-commerce is really kind of taking the retail market by storm,” Grider said. “It’s growing year after year and customers are demanding the ability to do this to save time.” 15 CONNECTTWEET 4 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/2bvXFZw TOP VIDEOS Passengers Evacuated to Tarmac During Shooting 1:38 AP Top Stories January 6 P 1:13 Connected Devices Raise Security Concerns 2:09 AP Top Stories January 6 A 1:00 NOAA Plans to Expand Fish Farming in Pacific 1:56 Farm Sculpted Out of Thousand Pounds of Butter 0:45 Farm Sculpted Out of Thousand Pounds of Butter 0:45 Pelosi and Pro-Choice Groups Ready To Fight 1:30 Ryan Backs Intel Community, but Defends Trump 1:16 Sears seeks to stem bleeding: closes more stores, sells Craftsman brand 0:35

By Joel Berg, August 26, 2016 at 5:00 PM It was an early sign of trouble for Apple Pay: Cashiers staring in curiosity as I waved my iPhone in front of credit-card readers. I persisted in pursuit of what I thought would be the future of payments: credit and debit cards linked to smartphones. The so-called mobile wallet is still coming, just not as quickly or in the form you might have expected. The challenge for businesses, especially smaller ones, is to figure out what technology they need to invest in to attract and retain customers. The average American shopper is expected to spend more than $3,000 using mobile devices in 2019, up from an expected $721.47 this year, according to research company eMarketer. Even the biggest technology companies have yet to find the right app to capture that growth. Apple Pay and its cousins, Android Pay and Samsung Pay, are struggling to convince people to stop using plastic and start using their phones, according to industry experts. Retailers like CVS, Starbucks and Walmart, on the other hand, appear to be having more success. Can you pay me now? Walmart Pay is ready for a close-up. Open the app, log in, scan the QR code to pay. - (Joel Berg) The puzzle mobile payments must solve in the U.S. is fairly straightforward: How do you replace what is already a streamlined process? I don’t save much time pulling out my iPhone instead of reaching into my wallet and sliding out a credit card. So far, the shoppers who wield their phones tend to be the people who like to try new things, said Daniel Van Dyke, an analyst with Javelin Strategy & Research, a financial services research firm based in Pleasanton, Calif. The novelty wears off. According to figures from Javelin, people are paying less often with their phones. Between 2013 and 2015, the mean number of monthly transactions per user fell from 3.7 to 3. “That’s because users who stick on the platform realize they’re not getting anything out of it,” Van Dyke said. “It’s a major problem these providers have to address.” To entice users, Android, Apple and Samsung have been handing out incentives. Samsung Pay, for example, offered gift cards this spring to first-time users. Companies also are exploring how to incorporate loyalty rewards.  Retailers, however, don’t have to experiment. They can offer all kinds of rewards from the get-go, starting with the ability to order ahead and skip lines, a feature available from Starbucks, the sandwich chain Subway and others. Walmart Pay, meanwhile, incorporates the company’s promise of low prices. The payment process for Walmart Pay is not much different than the one for Apple Pay, as I learned during a recent demonstration at the Walmart in Silver Spring Township, Cumberland County. But after you buy your goods using Walmart Pay, you can use the app to scan for lower prices at competing retailers. Any savings are totted up and stored on a gift card for spending later. At Walmart, of course. It’s likely someone already is figuring out how to incorporate the app into the Black Friday experience. There will be apps for that The good news for smaller businesses is that they don’t have to jump on the Apple/Android/Samsung Pay bandwagon. The bad news is that they risk being leapfrogged by larger competitors with millions of dollars to invest. “Those companies are transforming the way they receive payments,” said Robb Gaynor, chief product officer at Malauzai, a Texas-based provider of digital banking products. But where there is money, there are solutions. Over the next few years, technology companies, credit card companies and financial institutions are likely to find ways to help smaller businesses accept mobile payments, Gaynor said. In fact, Malauzai recently worked with a community bank in California to develop a payments app for a business customer, Gaynor said. “Our take on it is the banks are in a unique position to help, especially the local businesses,” he said. And if you’re wondering whether people really want a bunch of payment apps on their phones? Consumers are used to juggling credit cards. They will get used to juggling multiple payment apps. “Starbucks ain’t going away and neither is Apple Pay,” Gaynor said. “And neither of them is going to hold all of the market.” More from the Fast Forward Blog • A rising tide won't lift sinking ships • Six predictions for 2017 • The Fed sends a blockchain letter you shouldn't ignore • Rejecting 'Reefer Madness': Changing laws, changing minds Share This Story: Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn   Joel Berg Joel Berg is editor of the Central Penn Business Journal.

By Jamie Grill-Goodman — August 26, 2016 After several quarters of disappointing online sales, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.'s e-commerce sales increased 11.8% in its second quarter 2017 with U.S. e-commerce results stronger than key international markets for the retailer. While one quarter of sales acceleration doesn't spell success, Walmart has been making huge moves to grow its online sales. The retailer recently agreed to purchase e-commerce retailer Jet.com, Inc. for approximately $3 billion in cash, an acquisition could give Walmart's online business the edge it needs to compete with Amazon.  In July, after months of gradually rolling out Walmart Pay, the mobile payment solution became available in all Walmart stores in the U.S. In China, Walmart recently announced it will sell its Yihaodian website to JD.com Inc. JD's significant presence online, where Wal-Mart and Sam's Club will feature prominently, allows Walmart the opportunity to extend the reach of its brands to millions of new customers. "Whether it’s through online grocery, Walmart Pay, or broadening our reach in China through the alliance with JD.com, we're making it easier for customers to access products when and how they want," said Brett Biggs, EVP & CFO, Walmart. "Now, with the agreement to acquire Jet.com, we're building on our e-commerce foundation and creating an opportunity to accelerate e-commerce even further." Walmart has also broadened its e-commerce assortment and expanded online grocery pickup to 30 more markets this quarter bringing the total to more than 60 markets and nearly 400 locations. Since the beginning of the year, Walmart added about 7 million new items to the marketplace assortment and now offers approximately 15 million SKUs.   "The distinctions that we talk about today between stores, apps, pick-up, delivery and sites are continuing to blur into the background for customers," noted Doug McMillon, President & CEO Walmart. "For them, it’s just Walmart." New Leadership Walmart's current global e-commerce chief, Neil Ashe, will leave the company by the end of the fiscal year. Once the Jet.com acquisition is complete, Marc Lore, current President and CEO of Jet.com will become Walmart's new President and CEO of e-commerce, reporting to McMillon. Lore will be responsible for both the Walmart and Jet brands in the U.S. Not only is Lore the founder of Jet.com; he also co-founded Quidsi, which owned Diapers.com, Soap.com, and Wag.com, before it was sold to Amazon in 2011.  During Ashe's tenure, Walmart more than doubled its e-commerce GMV, became the second most trafficked e-commerce site in the U.S., re-platformed Walmart.com, and opened a national fulfillment center network. "Building on this solid foundation, we made some strategic decisions to position ourselves for the future in the priority markets of the U.S. and China, including the announcement last week to acquire Jet.com," said McMillon. "Operating Walmart.com and Jet.com will allow us to reach even more customers and drive a higher level of growth more quickly. One of the things we like about the technology they've developed is that it rewards customers in real-time with savings on a basket of goods and puts them more in charge of the price they pay." Jet has created a unique way to deliver the lowest cost basket online and building a basket of goods rather than ordering one item at a time allows shipping economics in Walmart's favor. Customers won’t see changes immediately, however, as Walmart awaits government approval and the necessary tech platform changes. "While there is still a lot of work to do in executing our multi-year plan, we're encouraged by the results we're seeing," said Biggs.

Her sweet potato pie was a smash-hit last year for Walmart, her exclusive retailer. Now she’s expanding her line to include five new desserts: berry cobbler, apple cobbler, peach cobbler, apple pecan cake and sweet potato loaf. LaBelle’s sweet potato pie hit stores last August, but it wasn’t a huge success until Youtube star James Wright Chanel sang its praises in a expletive-laced video that went viral. “I want to taste Patti live,” said Wright, breaking into song as soon as he dug in. “You turn into Patti after eating this! Go to Walmart and buy the Patti LaBelle pie.” After that video came out in November, LaBelle’s sweet potato pie sold like hot cakes. “We were selling one per second for a while after his video went live,” said Walmart spokesman John Forrest Ales. “He posted that video and we sold out and had to quickly make more, a million pounds.” And it wasn’t just a Thanksgiving thing. Even after the holidays the pies were still selling, so Walmart has been churning them out year round even though they were originally meant to be a seasonal item. “It’s pretty insane that it’s August and people are still buying the sweet potato pie,” said Ales. LaBelle fans may want to brace themselves for a bit of sticker shock, though. While the sweet potato pie costs $3.98, the cobblers are $6.98, the apple pecan cake costs $9.98. LaBelle was not immediately available for comment.

Starting Sept. 2, Walmart will sell premium cobblers in peach, apple and mixed berry flavors. Inspired by a recipe from one of LaBelle’s cookbooks, the cobblers are baked with crusts on top and bottom. Houston-based Walmart supplier Twin Star Bakery will make the pies, which will be sold fresh rather than frozen. Patti LaBelle's cobblers will come in peach, apple and mixed berry flavors. (Photo courtesy of Walmart) In the Northeast, the retailer also plans to roll out LaBelle’s apple pecan cake and sweet potato pound cake. Walmart launched the original #PattiPie last November. It proved so popular that stores had trouble keeping the sweet potato pies on the shelves. In January, the retailer expanded the line with premium vanilla pound cake and premium caramel cake and created a website where customers could search to see if Patti LaBelle bakery products were available in their local store. Rush noted Walmart added 60 new items to the bakery in 2015. “Today, more than half of our items are prepared in our stores, and we’ve enriched our teams across the country with bakery technicians who’ve been training and helping our store associates to ensure everything comes out exactly right,” said Rush. “On top of that, we’re simplifying our processes so that we can bake many different items at one temperature, allowing us to produce more fresh-baked goods for our customers every day.” TAGS: News Walmart 0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next DENVER - Target’s recent woes on Wall Street has consumers and analysts pondering why Target is tumbling. It's prompted the question: Is Target really that off on prices? Everybody likes to save money, even if it’s just a couple of cents. That may be why one the nation’s largest retailer is struggling. Target Corp. cut its profit forecast and a key sales outlook last week as it saw fewer customers in its stores.  Target struggled to get its grocery offerings right and shoppers looking for deals on essentials like detergent were turned off.  Denver7 wanted to find out if the Minneapolis-based retailer is competitive in the grocery aisle. We checked prices at both Target and Walmart. We created a 26-item list before hitting the stores. The prices in this comparison were checked on Thursday August 25. We visited the Target store in Sheridan and the Walmart location on Hampden Avenue in Englewood. The basics are there, like bread and milk, but items on the list are just a small fraction of what a busy family might purchase on a typical grocery trip. What did we find out? It might not be a surprise to most savvy shoppers, but Walmart came out ahead - but only by a few dollars. Our total at the nation’s largest retailer (before tax) came to $78.76. Target, on the other hand, was $80.68 - that’s a difference of just a $1.92. Another disclaimer: Some of the items we compared on our list were on sale at Target, so the difference would be a few dollars more if the items on the list were purchased on a different date. Walmart beats ‘em by pennies Walmart not only came out the pricing champ, it was the low price leader on virtually every item we compared to Target’s non-sale regular price - however we’re talking pennies here. Walmart shoppers may know the retailer never prices anything ending in .99. They often price their products just a couple cents off the dollar, like a box of Oreos for $2.98. Target sells the same box of cookies for $2.99. Although the price differences on the items we compared often came down to a few cents, some things on our list had wider price gaps. Beef for instance was more than 30 percent higher at Target.  Variety is the spice of life Another reason people may be choosing Walmart over Target is the selection offered at the Arkansas-based retailer. One of things we noticed during our price comparison is that Walmart’s aisles appeared to be fuller and offered more of a selection than Target. While Target appeared cleaner and more organized.  Target reported net income for the quarter of $680 million, or $1.16 per share. That compares with $753 million, or $1.18 per share, a year earlier. Adjusted per-share earnings were $1.23, beating projections of $1.14 from Wall Street, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research. Revenue fell 7 percent to $16.2 billion. --------- Sign up for Denver7 email alerts to stay informed about breaking news and daily headlines.

Here's what you should know. Matthew Frankel (TMFMathGuy) Aug 26, 2016 at 10:42AM Image source: The Motley Fool. In Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) latest Securities and Exchange Commission filing, it was revealed that the company boosted its stake in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) by 55% during the second quarter and sold a significant number of its Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) stock, to name the two most significant moves. While I never advise buying or selling a particular stock just because a billionaire does, here's what investors should learn from these moves. Adding to Apple while it's cheap During the second quarter, Berkshire added another 5.42 million shares of Apple to its portfolio, increasing its stake by 55%. And, to be fair, the Apple investment isn't Buffett's doing -- rather, one of his stock pickers pulled the trigger on the tech giant. However, the Apple purchase and its subsequent add-on are very Buffett moves. Here are a few Apple characteristics that Buffett tends to look for: An extremely powerful brand name: Other major Buffett holdings (Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz, American Express) all have some of the most recognizable brand names in the world. Trades cheaply: As of this writing, Apple trades for a low multiple of 12.8 times trailing-12-month (TTM) earnings. Minuscule debt load (relatively speaking): Apple has a little more than $70 billion in debt, but also has more than $230 billion in cash and marketable securities. Plus, Apple's debt is at a low average effective interest rate of 2.47%. A record of growth and profitability: Apple has grown its revenue and profits impressively in every single year over the past decade or so, including during the tumultuous 2008-2010 period. I could go on, but the point is that even though Buffett didn't decide to invest in it, Apple certainly makes sense in Berkshire's portfolio. And while we don't know exactly when Berkshire added on to its Apple holdings, or at what price, I suspect that a major reason was simply that Apple got even cheaper during most of the second quarter. AAPL data by YCharts. This is one of the most valuable lessons any long-term investor can learn. When you do your research and buy the stock of an excellent company and it proceeds to drop like a rock, don't panic and sell. Instead, look at it as a valuable opportunity to add to your position at a discount. And I believe that has a lot to do with Berkshire's increased stake. Know when to walk away During the second quarter, Berkshire sold 27% of its Wal-Mart stake, leaving Berkshire with 40.2 million shares. This follows the smaller unloading of 950,000 shares during the first quarter. While 40.2 million shares of Wal-Mart are still worth nearly $3 billion -- no small chunk of change -- I have a feeling the selling is not done just yet. To explain why, consider the reasons why Buffett bought Wal-Mart in the first place. Berkshire started to accumulate Wal-Mart shares rather aggressively in 2005 and more than doubled its stake in the years following the financial crisis. First of all, at the time Buffett bought Wal-Mart, shares were trading cheaply. In the 2009-2012 period, when Berkshire accumulated about 26.7 billion shares, Wal-Mart was trading at price-to-earnings multiples between 11 and 15. Today, Wal-Mart trades for about 16.4 times TTM earnings. What's more, the company's revenue and especially its earnings growth was much better when Buffett was buying. Fiscal Year Revenue Earnings Per Share Revenue Growth EPS Growth 2009 $405.6 $3.35 7.1% 6% 2010 $408.2 $3.72 0.6% 11% 2011 $421.8 $4.18 3.3% 12.4% 2012 $447.0 $4.54 6% 8.6% 2013 $469.2 $5.02 5% 10.6% 2014 $476.3 $4.85 1.5% -3.4% 2015 $485.7 $4.99 2% 2.9% 2016 $482.1 $4.57 -0.7% -8.4% Data source: S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue in billions. In a nutshell, the high earnings growth and low valuation of the 2009-2013 period made Wal-Mart highly attractive. The higher valuation of today combined with two out of three years of negative EPS growth, not so much. Furthermore, Wal-Mart has more of an identifiable competitive advantage in those years. Amazon.com has since evolved into much more of a competitive threat, and Buffett even said in May that Wal-Mart is under pressure to compete with Amazon. It remains to be seen whether Berkshire intends to completely wind down its position in Wal-Mart or if it simply wanted to reduce its exposure to a potential price war with Amazon. Either way, the lesson is clear: When your original reasons for buying a stock no longer apply, it's OK to rethink your investment and, if necessary, head for the exits. The bottom line Warren Buffett is perhaps the most closely followed investor in the world, not just for the particular stocks he buys but for the timeless investing lessons that can be learned from what he buys and sells. The point here is not that you should buy Apple or sell Wal-Mart, but to apply these lessons to the stocks in your own portfolio and to stocks that you're considering.

Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales accelerated last quarter. Can it keep it up? Adam Levy (adamlevy) Aug 26, 2016 at 10:35AM Image source: Wal-Mart The story at Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) for the past year or so has been its declining online sales growth. E-commerce growth went from 16% in the second quarter of last year to 10% in the third quarter before falling into single-digit territory for two straight quarters. Last quarter, e-commerce sales started to rebound, growing 12% year over year. But one quarter of sales acceleration doesn't make a comeback. With a lot of rearrangement in its e-commerce divisions, Wal-Mart is setting itself up for continued growth in online sales. Dropping the dead weight in China Until recently, Wal-Mart operated a site called Yihaodian in China. It bought a 51% stake in the company in 2012, and it bought out the remaining 49% last year for $760 million. After struggling to grow the business, Wal-Mart sold the company to JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) for a 5% stake in the leading Chinese e-commerce company. That stock was worth about $1.5 billion at the time of the agreement, roughly the same value Wal-Mart bought out Yihaodian for last year. The fact that Wal-Mart was unable to increase the value of Yihaodian over the past year is indicative of slow sales growth. It's possible the tie-up with JD.com will help spur sales, considering its success with e-commerce in China. Shedding that slow-growing property from its e-commerce platform may allow whatever growth is happening on its websites in the rest of the world to shine through. That's not really sales acceleration, but it makes the numbers look good. What could actually spur acceleration is the other part of Wal-Mart and JD's agreement. Wal-Mart will establish a store on JD.com under its Sam's Club brand. Additionally, JD.com will list Wal-Mart as a preferred retailer on JD.com's O2O JV Dada, China's largest crowd-sourced delivery platform. Bringing in Jet propulsion Earlier this month, Wal-Mart purchased Jet.com for $3 billion in cash and $300 million in stock. Jet is one of the fastest growing e-commerce start-ups in the United States, and it instantly adds about $1 billion in gross merchandise volume to Wal-Mart's operations. That's about a 7% boost to Wal-Mart's 2015 e-commerce sales. With the acquisition, Wal-Mart is bringing on Marc Lore to lead its e-commerce business. Not only did he start Jet.com; he also started Quidsi, which owned Diapers.com, Soap.com, and Wag.com, before Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) bought the company in 2011. Wal-Mart's previous head of e-commerce, Neil Ashe, was a digital-media guy -- not an e-commerce guy. With Lore at the helm, Wal-Mart could see some improvements in its e-commerce operations from a seasoned vet with a track record of growing companies. Growing investments On top of Wal-Mart's blockbuster acquisition of Jet.com, the company plans to spend $900 million on improving its e-commerce platform this year. Next year, that number will climb to $1.1 billion. That's up from $700 million in fiscal 2016. A large chunk of that money is earmarked for building more fulfillment centers to compete with Amazon Prime's two-day shipping. Earlier this year, Wal-Mart launched ShippingPass, which offers the same two-day shipping perk of Amazon Prime. It doesn't include the bevy of other benefits Amazon offers Prime members, such as video and music streaming, free e-book rentals, unlimited cloud storage for photos, and more, but it's half the price at just $49 per year. Wal-Mart is also investing in expanding its online grocery ordering. CEO Doug McMillan specifically pointed to online grocery sales as a reason for the acceleration of Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales in the second quarter. Online grocery pickup is currently available in just 60 markets and 400 locations. Considering Wal-Mart has over 5,000 locations and nearly 3,500 Supercenters in the United States, it has a lot of room to grow that part of its business. Online grocery pickup, in particular, takes advantage of Wal-Mart's brick-and-mortar locations -- its biggest advantage over Amazon. If Wal-Mart can continue to leverage its physical locations through innovative supply chain management or online ordering options, it could continue to accelerate sales. Amazon has continued to grab share of the market as Wal-Mart's sales slow. If Wal-Mart's big investments don't help turn around its sales growth, it will be a major blow to the company; overall revenue growth came in at just 0.7% through the first half of fiscal 2017 after flat revenue in the first half of last year. The company is counting on e-commerce to keep that number moving in the right direction. Adam Levy owns shares of Amazon.com. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Amazon.com.

Nineteen-year-old Jocelyn Gerstenlauer was working at the Walmart on Sardis Church Road in Buford on Tuesday, July 19. Investigators say two suspects came through her line and used ten fake $100 bills. Each was marked with "For Motion Picture Use Only". %INLINE% The two suspects, later identified as Melissa Sinquefield and Travis Taylor, used the fake money to buy lawn equipment. Some of that equipment was later returned for real cash at a different Walmart location. Jocelyn never returned to work after the movie money was found in her register. Now, police say she knew about it the whole time. According to investigators, Melissa confronted Jocelyn about money she was owed. After the confrontation, the cashier accepted the movie money from the suspects. Police said Gerstenlauer turned herself into authorities at Gwinnett County Jail on Tuesday. Police said Sinquefield is aware of warrants and has made plans to turn herself in as well.

Josh Mitelman jmitelman@islandpacket.com Motorists drive past the new median that divides the Bluffton Road entrance to Kittie's Crossing shopping center on Friday. Since it was put in late last month, the median has generated a number of complaints from customers and businesses at the center, and has been the cause of at least three accidents. Jay Karr jkarr@islandpacket.com Businesses in the Kittie’s Crossing shopping center off Bluffton Road say that a median recently added to the center’s entry road is causing an inconvenience and danger to customers and employees. Josh Mitelman jmitelman@islandpacket.com 1 of 3 i By Madison Hogan mhogan@islandpacket.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The property owner of an outparcel in Kittie’s Crossing shopping center in greater Bluffton has served Walmart with a temporary restraining order after the retailer built a median at the complex’s Bluffton Road entrance at the end of July. Earlier this month, Walmart was ordered by South Carolina Department of Transportation to stop all roadwork associated with the construction of the superstore and Sam’s Club that are being built across the street from Kittie’s Crossing. Stafford Bluffton, which owns the outparcel where Giuseppi’s Pizza and Pasta, AAA Carolinas, Palm Beach Tan, Panda Chinese Restaurant and La Hacienda are located, filed a temporary restraining order against Walmart, along with the retail giant’s contractor and developer, McCrory Construction and Jaz Development. North Bluffton Properties owns the remaining property in Kittie’s Crossing and is also named among the defendants. The court documents filed say the elongated median was built without permission from Stafford. The property owner is asking that an injunction be placed against the defendants and that the new median be removed and the old median replaced. Questions about whether the retailer received permission from North Bluffton Properties remain unanswered. Roberts Vaux, a legal representative for North Bluffton Properties, said Tuesday afternoon that the parties involved met for a hearing that morning and came to a short-term agreement that does not resolve all the issues. He said he could not comment on the details of that agreement. Phillip Keene, director of corporate communications for Walmart, wrote in an email Thursday that Walmart was working with SCDOT and others to address some of the concerns raised about the median and other traffic controls at the intersection. “We’re grateful for the feedback we have received and will continue to address concerns quickly and appropriately,” he wrote. “At this time, due to legal matters, it would not be appropriate for us to comment any further on this project.” Will Euart, vice president of Stafford Properties (also known as Stafford Bluffton), said Tuesday morning he could not comment on the agreement. The consent order was signed Aug. 16 by Stafford’s attorney, Russell Patterson — the same day the SCDOT ordered Walmart to stop working on Bluffton roads. A representative of the SCDOT, Michael Black, told The Island Packet and The Beaufort Gazette that Walmart was not allowed to work on the intersection until the state could verify that Walmart had permission from property owners to build the median. Walmart was allowed to pave the roads Aug. 16 due to safety concerns but was not allowed to continue any other construction. Josh Gruber, the deputy county administrator, said last week that Walmart needs a signal at that intersection in order for the stores to be approved by the county and for the retailer to receive a certificate of occupancy. If Walmart doesn’t receive the certificate, customers would be barred from entering the stores, though Gruber said he would be surprised if that happened. Walmart admitted to building the median in a statement on Aug. 12, two weeks after the installation of the median. So far, three car wrecks have been reported in that area after the median was built.

Today we're tackling another complicated, thorny question about race: Are African... Aug 26, 2016 — by Brian Mann (Adirondack Bureau Chief) , in Newcomb, NY North Country Public Radio was able to confirm significant parts of Alvin Codner's account of two racial incidents in the Adirondacks this summer. The Florida man was visiting the Park for the first time when he was called the N-word and threatened. Photo: Brian Mann Listen to this story Aug 26, 2016 — Today we're tackling another complicated, thorny question about race: Are African American tourists and other people of color really welcome in the North Country? Our region is one of rural America’s biggest tourist destinations. From the Adirondacks to the Thousand Islands, millions of people come to our small towns every year. But the overwhelming majority of those visitors are white and some critics — and even some experts inside the tourism industry — say people of color don't always feel welcome or safe here. The conversation was sparked in part by a series of troubling racial incidents that happened in the Adirondacks this summer. Alvin Codner's story Alvin Codner, age 26, was working at a camp in the Adirondacks as a sports instructor. He’s from Florida and this was his first trip to the Park. On his off day, he and some friends went to Lake George, one of the North Country’s most popular destinations, stopping to eat at Duffy's, a tavern and restaurant on Amherst Street popular with tourists. Sierra Club president Aaron Mair spoke at a diversity conference in Newcomb. Also pictured, Alvin Codner (center) and Peter Nelson (left) with the Adirondack Diversity Advisory Council, one of the organizers of the gathering. Photo: Brian MannCodner said trouble started right away, that he and other people of color in the group were asked repeatedly for their IDs and then were confronted by the bouncer. "He said I know how you guys like your fried chicken, your orange soda, watermelon, Kool-Aid, and white girls," Codner recounted. The encounter escalated and Codner’s group was told to leave Duffy’s. A couple of weeks later, there was a second incident. He and a mixed-race group of friends were at the Wal-Mart in Ticonderoga when they were confronted by a white man using racial slurs. "The white guy said, Hey n——-, I want to see you outside. Hey n——-, I want to see all three of you n—— and look how you look," Codner said. An experience no one should ever go through Before we talk more broadly about what these incidents might say about the experience of people of color visiting the North Country, it’s important to say that North Country Public Radio was able to verify significant parts of Codner’s story.  A Wal-Mart spokeswoman confirmed that Codner and his friends were accosted by a white man using racial slurs and the incident was unprovoked. "The experience Mr. Codner had with another shopper in our store is something no one should ever go through," said Wal-Mart's Leslee Wright.   So much to do in the North Country. So why are nearly 90% of the visitors white? Photo: Brian MannIn some ways, the story at Duffy’s in Lake George is more complicated. Co-owner Linda Duffy said her business is welcoming, that she’s comfortable with diversity.  "There are different races in our family," she said.  Duffy said the dispute with Codner’s group began as an argument over the bill. But she acknowledged that the exchange between Codner’s group and her bouncer may have turned racial. "If he had said anything [racial] to them, I don't know," Duffy said. "If he did, I apologize. He no longer works for us." DONATE NCPR is made possible by donations from visitors like you. Click to donate today. Ugly incidents, a wider problem The proprietor of the business [was] telling N-word jokes from the time we entered to the time we exited the buildingIf these were one-off incidents, affecting one group of people of color, it would be troubling and ugly. But tourism industry experts say they don’t think Alvin Codner’s experience was unique.    Kim Rielly, director of communications for ROOST, one of the North Country’s biggest tourism marketing groups based in Lake Placid, is white, but she said she had an experience this summer in an Adirondack tourism business that left her troubled. "The proprietor of the business [was] telling N-word jokes from the time we entered to the time we exited the building. That was surprising and certainly off-putting." According to Rielly, concerns about racial sensitivity are serious enough in the Adirondacks that she’s careful when planning press and media junkets for ROOST’s marketing campaigns. "Sometimes those media are black [people] and I put their itineraries together. There are simply some places we won't add to that itinerary because we're not confident they'll have a positive experience," she said. The first step:  Making people of color feel safe ROOST, the Lake Placid-based regional marketing organization, has included mixed-race couples and people of color, as well as members of the LGBT community in advertising and marketing efforts. Photo: Provided by ROOSTThe experiences of Alvin Codner and his friends in Lake George and Ticonderoga have spurred a new conversation about how the region’s tourism businesses can be more welcoming, more open. Earlier this month, a coalition of groups held a diversity conference in Newcomb in Essex County.  One of the speakers was Aaron Mair, president of the Sierra Club, the first African American to hold that post. He said that the incident at Wal-Mart was particularly troubling. "A racial assault happens and not one person thinks to call the cops?" Mair noted. Wal-Mart’s spokeswoman acknowledged to North Country Public Radio that while one of their employees “broke up” the encounter, no one called police. She also confirmed that the white man who threatened Codner’s group wasn’t asked to leave the store. Mair said that decision was unacceptable and sent a dangerous signal. "Either this place is safe for children and people of color to be or it isn't," he said. Bigotry is bad business Lake Placid is one of America's most popular small town tourism destinations. Visitorship here is slightly more diverse than the rest of the North Country, but nearly 80% of the tourists are still white. Photo: Brian MannAt the Newcomb gathering, people talked about the racial divide in the North Country’s visitor experience in two ways. First, the existence of raw bigotry. "There are people who are going to be blatantly racist," said Peter Nelson with the Adirondack Diversity Advisory Council. "There will also be people like that." Nelson said his group can’t solve racism per se, but it can focus on the second issue: helping businesses and other organizations in our largely white small towns respond better.  "The way that businesses deal or don't deal with these kinds of issues. The way they do or don't have competence with issues of diversity and people of different backgrounds and cultures and colors. That [shortcoming] is ubiquitous throughout the Park," he said.    In part, this is a story about fairness, about openness, but it’s also a story about business. Tourism is a huge part of the North Country’s economy. Jim McKenna, head of the tourism marketing group ROOST, said people of color will soon make up nearly half of potential visitors. A lot of local companies just aren’t ready. "I think that some of the larger businesses, they treat [people of color] as a normal customer, no matter what their ethnic background is," McKenna said. But he acknowledged that "that's not prevalent throughout the Park." He said his organization is working to remind tourism businesses that making black, Hispanic and Asian visitors is a "dollars and cents" issue that will shape their bottom line going forward. But the region has a long way to go. Last year, a study found that 90% of visitors to the Adirondack Park were white.   Care to comment on this story?

Published on August 26, 2016. Target associates pitched in to help victims of the Louisiana floods. Credit: Target Most Popular Following historic floods in Louisiana, several marketers are pumping up their relief efforts. Brands including Target, Walmart, Starbucks and Tide have all contributed in recent days. Earlier this month, epic rainfall flooded the area with over 6.9 trillion gallons of water. Minneapolis, Minn.-based Target, which has six stores and over 1,000 staffers in the Baton Rouge area and other affected areas, has pitched in with volunteers and distribution of water and giftcards to local nonprofits. The retailer has also donated $100,000 each to the Salvation Army and American Red Cross. Related Stories National TV 'News' Scores an Epic Fail for an Epic Flood in Louisiana Similarly, Bentonville, Ark.-based Walmart announced recently that its foundation will be giving $1 million to various nonprofits including the Greater Baton Rouge Food Bank in support. In total, the retail chain is committing $1.5 million for food and supplies. "We have been working closely with nonprofit partners, first responders, elected officials and governmental organizations to learn how we can use our strengths to help," said Kathleen McLaughlin, president of the Walmart Foundation, in a statement. Last week, Tide, which is owned by Procter & Gamble, sent its Loads of Hope truck to Baton Rouge in order to collect, wash and dry laundry free of charge for victims affected by the floods. P&G also handed out cleaning products including Mr. Clean and Swiffer. Duracell has also sent its truck with batteries and a charging station. Starbucks donated $100,000 to the American Red Cross, the coffee chain said recently. The brand encouraged customers and employees to text "LAFLOODS" to 90999 in order to donate $10 to the relief fund. Some brands have taken their efforts in an atypical direction. Pizza Hut, for example, started a GoFundMe page asking for contributions to help staffers affected by the tragedy. The restaurant chain, which is owned by $13.1 billion Yum Brands, has received nearly $8,000 of its $25,000 funding goal thus far. In addition, the Ad Council and GSD&M recently unveiled a black-and-white ad, "Our Turn," in response to the disaster, which is the country's worst since 2012's Hurricane Katrina. The film, which includes a voiceover from Matthew McConaughey, directs viewers to OurTurntoHelp.org.

"A lot of shoppers know Walmart is a great place to save money on everyday necessities like groceries," said Mark Mazza, CEO and co-founder of PromoCodeWatch.com. "But there are many more deals to be gotten at Walmart than just [those on] everyday items." Mazza went on to highlight some of the top items on which shoppers can save money, including furniture, televisions, and more. In an effort to help you score the best deals at Walmart, GOBankingRates reached out to some of the best and brightest shopping minds in the business, as well as a Walmart insider. Click through to find out what they said. This article was originally published by GOBankingRates. 6 steps to become a recovering spender A (nearly) foolproof way to hit your savings goals Crucial questions to ask when you're deep in debt 1. Simple Furniture Getty Images Walmart's in-house brand of furniture, Simple Furniture, offers a line of quality home furnishings at prices that are hard to beat. "In most cases, Walmart is consistently cheaper, with similar quality to IKEA, on desks, bookcases, entertainment centers and the like," said Kyle James, founder of Rather-Be-Shopping.com. 2. Mainstays futons Walmart.com Good for a college dorm or even a home office, Walmart futons are both comfortable and affordable. According to a Walmart's spokesperson, customers can score Mainstays futons online or in the stores for just $98 each. Research reveals that most of the chain's competitors charge more than $100 for the same models. 3. Televisions PAUL J. RICHARDS/AFP/Getty Images If you're looking to score an HDTV without blowing your budget, Walmart could have the solution. "Over the last year, about 20 percent of our Editors' Choice deals from Walmart were for TVs," said Benjamin Glaser, features editor with DealNews. "Of those deals, Walmart really slashes prices on off-brand HDTVs, like VIZIO, Sceptre and Element, which are often hundreds of dollars cheaper than name-brand equivalents." Glaser added that customers seeking higher-quality brands can still save money, as Walmart offers regular deals on Panasonic, Samsung and LG TVs. 4. Legos iStockphoto When it comes to toy purchases, Walmart has a habit of besting its competition. Both James of Rather-Be-Shopping and Howard Schaffer of Offers.com noted that Lego sets at Walmart are generally cheaper than those available from competing toy retailers, such as Toys "R" Us, Target and Amazon. "This is especially true when you get into your more expensive Lego sets, like Minecraft, Ghostbusters and Marvel Super Heroes," said James. 5. Sewing and craft supplies Getty Images/iStockphoto If you're looking for a hobby that keeps you or the kids off the computer, you might want to stop by your local Walmart. "Sewing supplies, fabric, ribbon, yarn and craft supplies are far cheaper at Walmart than at a craft or fabric store like Beverly's," said Teri Gault, a shopping expert and author of "Shop Smart, Save More." "Plus, Walmart has an ample selection to choose from." 6. LED desk lamps Getty Images/iStockphoto Let there be light for a lesser price. Walmart sells Mainstays LED desk lamps for as low as $5.87, according to the Walmart spokesperson. Considering that comparable lamps tend to cost $20 at other retailers, the spokesperson singled out this deal as one of the best the chain store has to offer. 7. Brand-name laundry detergent Getty Images/iStockphoto Multiple shopping experts agree that brand-name laundry detergent is consistently one of the best Walmart deals. "125-ounce Tide Original Scent Liquid Laundry detergent from Target is 12.9 cents per ounce, compared to 10.8 cents per ounce from Walmart," said Kendal Perez of Coupon Sherpa. Alicia DeMartini of BeFrugal echoed the sentiment, adding that other brick-and-mortar and online retailers usually can't beat Walmart's prices. 8. Starbucks coffee iStockphoto Even products by brand names as big as Starbucks can be found for cheaper prices at Walmart. "Coffee is a steal from Walmart," said Perez. "A 20-ounce bag of Starbucks Dark Caffè Verona Ground Coffee is priced at $11.98 (60 cents per ounce), compared to $8.19 for a 12-ounce bag from Target (68 cents per ounce) or $12.95 for a 16-ounce bag from Starbucks (81 cents per ounce)." 9. Wines Torsten Schon/Getty Images/iStockphoto There are plenty of generic brands that can save you money, and Walmart's store-brand wine gives the competition a run for its money. "Everyone knows about Trader Joe's two buck chuck, which is now $3. Walmart's Oak Leaf is comparable to TJ's [but available] for less," said Gault. Prices vary from store to store, but Walmart Oak Leaf wine usually goes for $2.29 per bottle, and wine experts have given it the thumbs up for its quality. 10. Organic foods Getty Images/iStockphoto Recently, Walmart made its first foray into the organic food market, and the customer reception has been positive. James and Perez have both observed that Walmart offers competitive prices on organic food products, even compared to organic supply staples like Sprouts Farmers Market. "For example, a 12-ounce jar of Justin's Almond Butter is priced at $8.97 at Walmart, compared to over $11 from Sprouts," said Perez. Walmart deals on organic foods also beat out more direct competitors, such as Target. "Crisco Pure Organic Coconut Oil is priced at $6.99 at Walmart, compared to Target's non-organic Crisco Coconut Oil for the sale price of $6.93," Perez said.

Food Safety News Breaking news for everyone's consumption Home Foodborne Illness Outbreaks Food Recalls Food Politics Events Subscribe About Us Jobs Directory Listeria prompts recall of fresh-cut vegetables in 9 states By News Desk | August 27, 2016 A Texas company is recalling 30,000 cases of fresh-cut vegetable products from eight retail chains — including Wal-Mart, QuikTrip and Publix — after a random sample tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes. Country Fresh LLC of Conroe, TX, distributed various combinations of 45 different fresh-cut vegetable products to retailers in nine states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. The recalled vegetables have best-by dates between Aug. 7 and Aug. 19, according to the recall notice that was posted Aug. 26 on the Food and Drug Administration’s website. “The company has ceased distribution of the affected product as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Country Fresh continue their investigation as to what caused the problem,” according to the recall notice. “Consumers who have purchased any of these products are urged to return it to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact the company at 281-453-3305.” Eight retailers received the fresh-cut vegetables, which are packaged in clear plastic “clamshell” containers and Styrofoam trays overwrapped with clear plastic film. The retailers are: BI-LO; Fresh Point; Harris Teeter Supermarkets; Publix Supermarkets Inc.; QuikTrip; The Spinx Company; Wal-Mart Stores Inc.; and Winn Dixie. No illnesses had been reported in connection with the fresh-cut vegetables as of the posting of the recall notice on the FDA’s website. Listeriosis, the infection caused by the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, can take up to 70 days after exposure before causing symptoms. The company initiated the recall after a sample collected from a retail store by officials with the  Georgia Department of Agriculture tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes. Dates for the sample collection and lab tests were not provided in the recall notice on the FDA’s website. Anyone who has eaten any of the recalled vegetables and develops symptoms of Listeria infection is urged to see a doctor immediately. Listeria monocytogenes is a microscopic organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.

By Jason Pafundi Kennebec Journal Follow on Twitter Email Writer 207-621-5663 Share Comment Read Article Samantha Jordan arranges a mathematics display in her classroom last week at Helen Thompson School in West Gardiner. In her first classroom and teaching first grade, Jordan's first day of school is Wednesday. Staff photo by Andy Molloy Checkout lines at stores such as Wal-Mart, Target and Staples have been packed this week with parents holding baskets filled with pencils, paper, notebooks and binders. The annual markdown of these supplies means that school is about to start. “My daughter Leah and I have a really fun time every year shopping for her school supplies,” said Amy Jordan, of Gardiner, who on Tuesday morning was at Staples in Augusta. “Though it’s bittersweet, because as each year passes, she grows up more and more.” Her daughter, 8, is going into third grade. Whitefield Elementary School Principal Josh McNaughton talks about renovation done over summer during an interview on Thursday at the school.

Staff photo by Joe Phelan Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → Across the region, districts are putting the finishing touches on summer maintenance projects, filling any remaining open positions and getting schools ready for students’ return this week. Many local schools open for the year on Wednesday, with Augusta students in grades 1-9 returning that day and all other Augusta students returning on Thursday. Superintendent James Anastasio said the city’s schools are “clean and safe and ready to greet the students.” The district did some regular maintenance including paving, painting and fixing up some bathrooms throughout the summer. Superintendent Patricia Hopkins, of School Administrative District 11, which includes Gardiner, West Gardiner, Randolph and Pittston, said her district recently completed a $3.8 million contract with Siemens that resulted in the updating and upgrading of boilers and lighting. The district switched to natural gas and installed solar panels in some spots. Hopkins said the money saved will cover the cost of the project, and the district’s operations will be more efficient. She hopes the efficiencies will allow the district to benefit from additional savings in the future. The district also built a storage unit next to the gymnasium at Gardiner Area High School to help solve equipment problems associated with the music program. The big project for Regional School Unit 2, according to Superintendent William Zima, is the continued negotiations to build a school in Monmouth. Zima said the district hopes to consolidate Monmouth Middle School and Henry L. Cottrell Elementary School into one building over the next several years. There will be public forums, including one Sept. 15, to discuss the ongoing plans. “We’ve also been doing typical maintenance and upgrades to our schools, and we’ve replaced some old fire safety doors in Richmond,” Zima said from his office on the Stevens School campus in Hallowell. RSU 2 includes Hallowell, Farmingdale, Monmouth, Richmond and Dresden. Whitefield Elementary School, a part of RSU 12, had asbestos removed after old, run-down flooring was taken up and replaced with new carpeting. Principal Joshua McNaughton said the crews took every precaution to make sure the asbestos was taken out safely, and he said he hasn’t heard any concern from parents. The school also updated its library to make it more inviting and comfortable for the students. Bookshelves were re-organized and seating areas were expanded. Beanbag chairs and other comforts will be added throughout the year, librarian Marcie Abbott said. All three superintendents said their districts nearly have filled all available positions, but all three expressed the same concerns about struggling to find special education teachers, which they said is a statewide, if not national, problem. “It’s a really, really tough job with a tremendous amount of paperwork, which I think would be mind-numbing,” Zima said. “There will continue to be more kids with special needs, but we have fewer special educators, so what happens?” Hopkins said a new state law requiring special educators to have full certification upon being hired has made it challenging because districts no longer can offer potential hires a conditional certificate. Districts also are finding it hard to recruit teachers in specialized areas including mathematics and science, in part because people with those skill sets aren’t looking at a career in education. “There are better-paying jobs, like in engineering, for someone with those skills,” Hopkins said. “It’s a concern because if we’re struggling now to find qualified professionals, where are we going to be in a few years if the trend continues?” Hopkins’ district did add several new positions through the budget process, including a new social worker at the high school, a second nurse and a new science, technology, engineering and mathematics — or STEM — teacher. The district also has a new pre-kindergarten-through-grade 2 social and behavioral program to help children at that level learn the social skills they need for the classroom. Augusta was able to fill the majority of the district’s open positions, Anastasio said, except for a plumbing teaching position at the Capital Area Technical Center. “But we’re all experiencing the same thing,” he said. “It’s getting more and more difficult to attract people to some specialized areas.” None of the superintendents has a definitive answer to the question of how education can attract new people to the profession, but they all offer multiple reasons why that task is becoming harder and harder. “Demands on teachers are increasing every year, and being a teacher is far more challenging now than it ever used to be, because of all the scrutiny and expectations,” Hopkins said. “It detracts from their ability to really focus on classroom instruction.” Anastasio said teaching isn’t competitive salarywise with other professions, so districts are relying on finding people who are committed to working with students to make a difference. But with all the social changes and problems facing so many of the region’s students, not the least of which is the opiate crisis, teachers and schools are being asked to do more than just teach. “We’re providing a lot more social services to students, and we’re doing things educators didn’t do in the past,” Anastasio said. “It’s part of the role of education, but it makes it more difficult to achieve the primary goal of education, which is to educate, because there are so many outside issues kids are facing.” He said for many students in the Augusta area, school is the most normal and safest place they can be during the day, so students and families are looking to schools for support. “It’s becoming a place for community service,” Anastasio said, “so we’re partnering with outside agencies to help provide those services to our kids.” Enrollment hasn’t increased or decreased, the three superintendents said, but the number of students with special needs has increased. Having to deal with budget cuts should be one of the major requirements listed on any superintendent’s job description. Zima, Anastasio and Hopkins are all impressed by how much their districts can do with such limited and decreasing resources. “It amazes me how our staff and administration is able to take those minimal resources and really stretch them and go above and beyond to meet the needs of our kids,” Hopkins said. Zima agreed, saying, “It’s quite amazing what public schools can do with a dollar.” Anastasio said everyone in the Augusta school district does whatever he or she can to provide the best opportunity for students, which is “where we get the best bang for our buck.” Despite the challenges of increasing social concerns and decreasing budgets, the three superintendents can’t wait for the school year to begin. “When you walk around in the summer, the schools are just buildings; then that changes when the kids are in there,” Zima said. “There’s so much laughter and excitement, and I love that.” Jason Pafundi — 621-5663 [email protected] Twitter: @jasonpafundiKJ Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

Why take a job in which you get low pay (for the qualifications),long hours (not just the ones in class), vilified for student failures, required committees and multiple meetings that take away from planning and collaboration and blamed for society’s problems? Public educators are paid with tax money and taxpayers don’t want to pay the price of truly excellent education.

(AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez) HOUSTON — Wal-Mart’s court fight to sell liquor at its stores in Texas looks to be back on track, but the courtroom is getting crowded. A federal appeals court is allowing a trade group representing liquor store operators to join a stalled federal lawsuit that the nation’s largest retailer filed against the Texas agency that hands out permits to sell booze by the bottle. In trying to crack Texas’ restrictions on package liquor licenses, some dating to the end of Prohibition, Wal-Mart contends that some of the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission’s rules amount to unconstitutional discrimination. Austin-based U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman had set the suit for trial next month, but everything stopped in May when the Texas Package Stores Association, representing about 2,500 existing liquor store retailers, got a green light from an appeals court to move forward with challenging Pitman’s refusal to let them intervene on the side of the beverage commission. A panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Pitman’s ruling last week and let the association join the lawsuit, saying the trade group had a “protectable interest that may be impaired or injured” in the outcome. Pitman now must set a new trial date. “On behalf of our Texas customers, we are prepared to pursue the case to provide Texans their freedom of choice,” Wal-Mart spokeswoman Anne Hatfield said. Booze is popular in Texas: The liquor industry in Texas generated nearly $14 billion in sales in 2014, the latest annual numbers available from the state Comptroller’s Office. And Wal-Mart, with its 574 stores, markets and Sam’s Club outlets in Texas, says it’s the state’s largest purveyor of beer and wine. While the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company sells liquor in 31 states, it’s resorted to court actions only in Texas to try to get into a state’s liquor market. In its February 2015 lawsuit, Wal-Mart touted it “helps people save money and live better by purchasing quality products at competitive prices.” But the Texas Package Stores Association contends the retailing giant wants to “upset the level playing field” and “change the structure of the Texas market” that’s existed for decades so the company can make “mass sales of low-priced liquor.” The store group contends the initial defendant, the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, was focused on more general issues regulating the alcoholic beverage industry in the state and not specifically on liquor store dealers who “stand to lose substantial revenues and long-term investments and be placed at a competitive disadvantage.” TABC spokesman Chris Porter said he couldn’t comment on pending court matters. Bills to loosen liquor license restrictions were introduced in the Texas Legislature in the last session in 2015 but never got out of committee. One such rule that mandates that a publicly traded company — like Wal-Mart — can’t hold separate beer and wine and liquor licenses; Hatfield said the rule “is counter to Texas’ belief in free enterprise and fair competition.” Another idiosyncrasy allows publicly traded hotel corporations to sell both beer and wine and liquor by the bottle, which Wal-Mart said in its lawsuit is “nothing more than naked economic protectionism.” A Texas liquor license holder also is limited to no more than five package stores, though an immediate blood relative can acquire other licenses and consolidate those licenses into a single entity that exceeds the five-store limit. The effect of that rule is growth of family-owned chain liquor stores in the state; Wal-Mart complains it has “no blood relative” to take advantage of the provision. The five-store limit and the prohibition on holding both a package store permit and a beer and wine retailer’s permit go back to 1935, when the Texas Liquor Control Board was created after Prohibition ended. Lawmakers revised its duties and renamed the panel in 1970, and legislators added the publicly traded company ban in 1995 to blunt the effect of a court ruling that invalidated a provision requiring a license holder to be a resident of Texas for at least a year. One restriction not being contested is a ban on liquor sales at grocery stores. A separate building with its own entrance is permitted under the law, and Wal-Mart says it would accommodate that by dedicating a distinct piece of property at stores to the liquor operation.

(Photo credit: MGN) AA WLOS —  HENDERSON COUNTY, N.C. -- The Henderson County Sherrif's Department asks residents to be on the alert for yet another phone scam. Recently scammers have targeted Henderson County residents by calling and telling them their children or grandchildren have been arrested and are in jail. The victims are told the only way they can bond their loved ones out is to buy a Walmart or ITunes card. Several Henderson County residents have fallen for this scam and lost thousands of dollars. The caller informs the victim they can’t use a check or credit card and must give them the code off the back of the purchased card. The twist to this current scam is the caller has represented themselves to be a member of the local district attorney’s office in the county where the child or grandchild is in jail. Bonding people out of jail with a gift cards is, obviously, not standard procedure. The reason the scammers insist on getting a Walmart or ITunes card is they have complete control over the value of the funds once the victim turns over the code. The scammer can either use the code or they can sell it. Once the scammer redeems or uses the code that was given, the victim cannot get their money back. Sheriff Charles McDonald urges anyone who might be contacted by these scammers to slow down, check out the facts, and not make a hasty decision to send money just because you are told a loved one has been arrested. Scammers want you to make quick decisions and can pressure you into doing something you will regret once you know the truth, McDonald said in a press release. If you feel you have been a victim of this or a similar scam, please contact the Henderson County Sheriff's Office at 828-697-4912. close News In Pictures Possible snow totals increasing; western N.C. could see 4-6 inches, icy roads Winter Storm Warning issued for WNC, Upstate Federal investigation underway in Weaverville Gallery: January 6, 2017 Snow Trending 1   Possible snow totals increasing; western N.C. could see 4-6 inches, icy roads 2   Federal investigation underway in Weaverville 3   Why we buy milk, bread and toilet paper when it snows 4   Homeland Security investigation in Weaverville continues with few answers 5   Winter Storm Warning issued for WNC, Upstate DON'T MISS OUT Stay Connected with WLOS Like Follow © 2016 Sinclair Broadcast Group TermsPrivacyFCC InfoEEO LOADING ShareTweet × Trending 1 Possible snow totals increasing; western N.C. could see 4-6 inches, icy roads 2 Federal investigation underway in Weaverville 3 Why we buy milk, bread and toilet paper when it snows 4 Homeland Security investigation in Weaverville continues with few answers 5 Winter Storm Warning issued for WNC, Upstate 6 Second round of snow expected Friday evening 7 Trooper saves the life of a small child: 'I said, Lord, I need your help' 8 Suspect traveled with gun in checked bag before killing 5 at Fort Lauderdale airport 9 Crews already working to make sure roads are safe for travel during the storm 10 Raid on Marion home leads to five suspects, drugs and guns

All warehouse clubs have similar offers, but one clearly gives its cardholders the most perks. Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Aug 27, 2016 at 10:23AM Image Source: Getty. Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) Sam's Club, and privately held BJ's Wholesale all operate essentially the same business. That gives consumers lots of choice. Sometimes geography provides the answer, and others it's a favorite product stocked by one of the the three, but not the others. In many cases, however, the decision to join Costco, Sam's, or BJ's comes down to which company offers the best rewards credit card. All three have cards that reward loyalty, but the perks vary between the chains. Knowing which warehouse club makes the most sense for you involves examining what each of the three credit card programs has to offer, then balancing it against your actual uses. Getting 4% off on gas, for example, may not be much of a perk if you don't drive, and free travel insurance or rental car benefits means less to people who travel infrequently. All three programs are generous, but different, with the "best" not necessarily being the same for everyone. What is Costco offering? Costco's card has been in the news recently because of the company's switch from its longtime provider American Express to the new Costco Anywhere Visa, serviced by Citigroup. That transition had its share of bumps, but now that the card has been moved over, cardholders receive some enhanced perks. Costco Anywhere does not come with an annual fee, but to get one you need to pay the warehouse club's $55 annual membership. Once you qualify for the card (all three of these cards, of course, require credit checks), it then serves as your membership ID. The new card's benefits include 4% cash back on gas purchases for the first $7,000 spent in a year. Costco Anywhere also offers 3% back on eligible travel spending and 2% cash back on all Costco purchases, with 1% returned on anything bought elsewhere. Aside from the gas benefit, none of the others has a cap. The new Visa card also offers worldwide car rental insurance along with worldwide travel accident insurance. In addition, it includes damage and theft protection. What is Sam's Club offering? Sam's has a cheaper membership price than both its rivals. The Wal-Mart company charges $45 a year compared to $55 at Costco and $50 at BJ's. Sam's Club members can also get nearly the whole membership fee back if they spend $100 on the day they open a Sam's Savings MasterCard account because the company will credit any customer who meets that initial spending threshold with $40. Members also get 5% back on gas -- on spending up to $6,000 a year (then it drops to 1% with no limit) -- 3% back on dining and travel, and 1% back on all other purchases. Cardholders also receive price protection on some purchases, as well as identity theft resolution services. Like Costco's card, Sam's does not have an annual fee and it doubles as your membership ID. A maximum of $5,000 in cash-back rewards can be earned in a calendar year. All three warehouse clubs have slightly different rewards offers. Image source: Wal-Mart. What is BJ's offering? The My BJ's Perks MasterCard offers 3% cash back on in-store and online purchases from the warehouse club. It also has a slightly different take on the gas reward, giving consumers $0.10 off per gallon with no limits. How that compares to 4%-5% off on gas varies based on the price of fuel, but with current prices hovering around $2 in much of the country, it's comparable. In general, given that current prices are near historic lows, it's fair to say BJ's offers a worse gas deal than its rivals unless your gas spending is more than Sam's $6,000 ceiling for its 5% giveback or Costco's $7,000 cap on its 4% reward. The BJ's credit card also offers 1% cash back on all other purchases made on the card and a $10 discount when it comes time for cardholders to renew their membership to the warehouse club. Like the rival cards, the My Perks MasterCard has no annual fee and serves as your membership card. Which is the best deal? These are all very similar overall deals. In fact these offers are so similar that, for consumers, it likely comes down to other factors beyond the card perks -- such as which warehouse club has a location closest to your home, or which one offers a product mix that's more to your liking. These are all good deals for frequent shoppers at the three chains, and the gas benefits can add up to a significant perk if you drive enough and can manage to fill up at your warehouse club of choice regularly.

Like other big companies before it, including Walmart and Google, Apple recently received a federal designation for its energy subsidiary that allows it to become a wholesale seller of electricity from coast to coast. In effect, Apple is creating its own green utility company, although the main customer is itself. The motives may be economic as much as they are environmental. As a wholesaler, Apple could reduce the cost of its electricity load, which reached 831 million kilowatt-hours in the last fiscal year — enough to power about 76,000 homes for a year. But like a growing number of corporations, Apple is intent on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production — one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. In one ambitious venture, Apple has contracted with First Solar to begin buying a little less than half of the power later this year from California Flats, a solar energy farm now under construction. Under the terms of the deal, Apple will pay $848 million for the electricity over 25 years and receive the farm’s total output by the end of the agreement. It is one of largest commercial clean energy contracts yet. Lisa Jackson, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who is now the Apple executive overseeing environmental policy, social initiatives and worldwide government affairs, said she hopes Apple will serve as a model for the many other big corporate power users that are now embracing clean energy. “This is just another sort of innovative way to get that power onto the grid so we don’t have to take the California grid-mix default, which still includes fossil fuel,” Jackson said. Although much of Apple’s manufacturing is done offshore, it still has extensive needs for electric power in the United States — and not only for the sprawling corporate complex it is building at its headquarters in Cupertino, and its 270 retail stores around the country. One of Apple’s biggest demands for electricity comes from operating the computing cloud through which it sells apps, music and videos to users of its iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. Apple’s move comes as prices for renewable energy continue to plummet. And signing long-term contracts allows businesses to shield themselves from potentially higher, more volatile charges from a power company. Apple would not say how much it is paying for California Flats’ energy, but Jackson said last year at a Wall Street Journal conference that it is less than what it paid for commercial power. She said she expects the company to save hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of the contract. Google, which received its federal energy wholesale designation from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2010, is a big proponent of the approach Apple is now taking. “Running any kind of business, having predictability in terms of your operating costs can be very important,” said Gary Demasi, director of operations for data center energy and location strategy at Google, which has been a leading investor in and user of clean energy. “Renewable energy, from a cost perspective, is now competitive with other forms of energy, much more so than it was a few years ago.” In the United States, the generating capacity of corporate clean energy projects has more than doubled each year since 2013, according to the Business Renewables Center at the Rocky Mountain Institute, which tracks publicly announced deals. In 2015, 11 companies signed up for 3.23 gigawatts’ worth of projects, roughly the equivalent of five coal plants and up from 1.18 gigawatts the year before. Executives face greater pressure from shareholders and customers to show that they are doing their part to fight climate change. At the same time, corporate energy use has exploded, driven in many cases by the ravenous demands of the data cloud. “We are all becoming very large energy players, and this is a shift,” said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft. “Energy is not something that Microsoft or Amazon or Google really ever had to think much about prior to the advent of the cloud.” Helping drive that shift are environmental groups like the World Resources Institute. In May, it helped create the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, a coalition of nonprofits that has more than 60 corporations in its network, including McDonald’s and General Motors, as well as Google and Walmart. Electric utilities have begun to respond by creating services to meet the corporate demand for clean energy, said Letha Tawney, the World Resources Institute’s director of utility innovation. One is a green tariff. It was pioneered in North Carolina by Duke Energy and is now under consideration in about a dozen states. It allows companies to designate that they are paying for a renewable energy supply. Another is a synthetic or virtual power purchase agreement, under which companies contract to buy the output of a clean power plant, as Apple is doing with California Flats. Although the companies say these arrangements mean they are running their businesses on renewable energy, in reality the clean power often does not flow directly to their facilities. They typically buy the renewable energy in amounts to match what they draw from the grid — a system of swaps that Jackson of Apple likened to using an ATM. “The dollar you deposit in the bank might not be the exact same bill that you get out,” she said. Robert F. Shapiro, a partner at the law firm Chadbourne & Parke who focuses on project finance and energy, describes it as meaningful symbolism. “They’re actually getting power from their local utility, which may be coal,” Shapiro said. “But they’re deemed to have put into the world carbon-neutral energy, which they are deemed to have used for their load.” To keep track of the clean energy credits, power generators work with registries to issue numbered certificates. “The power flows into the grid. The electrons go where they go,” Tawney said. “But because there’s a renewable-energy certificate, no one else can claim the same zero-carbon benefit.” Such complexities are necessary, executives and clean energy advocates say, because it is not often feasible to install enough renewable-power generators at corporate sites to meet companies’ full energy needs. Walmart, despite having installed solar panels, wind turbines and fuel cells at stores and distribution centers, can nonetheless meet only about a third of those operations’ energy needs. So it also buys renewable energy from generators and utilities, said David Ozment, director of energy at Walmart stores. At Apple, where the purchase or production of renewable energy has more than tripled since 2012, the company would prefer to not have to go to great lengths to ensure a clean energy supply, Jackson said. But the public energy grid is simply still too dependent on carbon fuels to make that possible. “If we had our preference, we’d just be able to say, ‘We want 100 percent green power everywhere we use power,’” Jackson said. “The best would be if we could run every one of our stores, every one of our data centers, every office complex, every building we have, on 100 percent renewable — and if we didn’t have to spend a whole bunch of our time and energy figuring out how to get that done.” Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Matthew Zinner, 17, of Conway is charged with attempted murder in connection with the incident, according to an Horry County police arrest warrant. At about 11:50 p.m. on Aug. 17, Zinner met with the 18-year-old male victim in the Wal-Mart parking lot at 151 Middle Ridge to sell him an unknown amount of marijuana, an arrest warrant states. The victim gave Zinner two counterfeit $100 bills, and Zinner got out of a vehicle and chased after the victim with a handgun and fired two shots at him, the warrant states. One shot struck the victim, and he feared for his life, according to the warrant. Horry County police met with the store manager when they arrived and the manager told authorities they thought someone was shooting in the parking lot, a report states. Officers found an abandoned hat and shoes and went to the hospital after hearing a gunshot victim had come in, police said. The victim told authorities he was shot while at Wal-Mart and left his shoes and hat behind during the incident, according to the report. Zinner was arrested Thursday and released later that day on $25,000 bond, according to J. Reuben Long Detention Center.

The world's largest retailer also raised its fiscal-year profit forecast, sending its shares up 1.5 percent. For the second quarter in a row, the company bucked a string of weak results from higher-end brick-and-mortar competitors like Target Corp, Macy's Inc, and Kohls Corp. Target cut its fiscal-year profit outlook on Wednesday after quarterly sales fell more than expected. Wal-Mart U.S. Chief Executive Officer Greg Foran said on a conference call that the company's customers were still cautious with their spending but were visiting stores more often and buying more items. Store visits increased 1.2 percent, and the average size of an order rose 0.4 percent during the second quarter ended on July 31. "We are seeing a steady improvement in the U.S. business, and it is responding favorably to the changes we are making," he said. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company said sales were strong for grocery items and apparel but weak for electronics. Wal-Mart has been spending heavily to get customers back. Earlier this year, it increased entry-level wages to $10 an hour and said it would invest $2.7 billion in employee compensation and training over two years, a move it says has led to cleaner stores, faster checkouts and better customer service. "Walmart's strategic investments are generating traction, which is especially meaningful, given a large portion of its customer base remains challenged," said Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea. The retailer said it was difficult to quantify the effects of low gasoline prices and unseasonably warm weather, but those factors contributed to overall sales growth. Online sales growth accelerated sequentially for the first time in more than five quarters, rising 11.8 percent from 7 percent in the first quarter on the back of investments in technology and warehouses to fulfill those orders. Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said e-commerce growth was stronger in the United States than in major overseas markets, mainly because of its larger third-party seller business and the continued roll-out of online grocery pickup options. Wal-Mart has added 7 million items on its website this year, bringing the total to 15 million. This compares with 200 million on online rival Amazon.com Inc. In hopes of accelerating its e-commerce business and narrowing the widening gap with Amazon, Wal-Mart is buying internet retailer Jet.com for more than $3 billion. The company raised its fiscal-year earnings outlook to between $4.15 and $4.35 a share, including an estimated hit of 5 cents from the Jet.com acquisition, from a previous range of $4.00 to $4.30. Second-quarter earnings per share of $1.07, excluding a gain from the sale of Wal-Mart's e-commerce business in China and other items, exceeded the analysts' average estimate by 5 cents. Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.6 percent, excluding fuel prices, to beat expectations in their eighth straight quarter of growth. International sales fell 6.6 percent to $28.6 billion but increased 2.2 percent on a currency-neutral basis. Total revenue rose 0.5 percent to $120.9 billion.

Now that the worst of the downturn has come and gone, investors have one last chance to buy value dividend stock Royal Dutch Shell plc (ADR) (NYSE:RDS.A, NYSE:RDS.B) on the dip. It’s certainly unusual to call a stock that is currently generating negative net income a value stock. However, most stocks don’t have cash flows and profits tied so closely to the price of a commodity like oil. Like many oil and gas stocks, if crude oil prices stay below $50/bbl, RDS.B stock will struggle to make significant headway. But assuming oil prices continue a steady long-term rise, Royal Dutch Shell is sitting in an ideal position. In the years leading up to the collapse of the oil market, RDS.B spent heavily on exploration and production projects. In addition, the company recently closed a massive $50 billion buyout of BG Group plc (ADR) (OTCMKTS:BRGYY). 7 Best Dividend Stocks You Haven’t Heard Of The buyout certainly stretched Royal Dutch Shell’s balance sheet thinner than shareholders would ever want to see it stretched. However, if oil prices recover, RDS.B’s aggressive buying will work wonders for its cash flow for years to come. RDS.B Is a Hidden Value Stock Royal Dutch Shell’s new game plan is selling off non-core assets, cutting costs as much as possible and attempting to stay afloat. Management is prioritizing spending until the crude oil market is more cooperative. The company now says its priorities will be debt reduction, dividends, capital investments and share buybacks. Click to Enlarge The following Bloomberg graph shows just how much Shell’s net debt has ballooned in 2016. Yet, so far, the company has opted not to cut the dividend. In fact, Shell hasn’t cut its dividend in 70 years. That fact is a good indication of how committed management is to maintaining the dividend. In June, CEO Ben van Beurden provided an update on this strategy. “By capping our capital spending in the period to 2020, investing in compelling projects, driving down costs and selling non-core positions, we can reshape Shell into a more focused and more resilient company, with better returns and growing free cash flow per share,” van Beurden explained. Of course, these projections assume at least $60/bbl crude oil prices in the long-term. Wall Street’s Take on Shell Stock The company and its shareholders are understandably optimistic, but what do industry experts think of Shell stock? Just this week, Argus analyst Bill Selesky reiterated his “Buy” rating of RDS.B. He expects RDS.B stock to outperform Energy sector peers and the S&P 500 in coming quarters. The ratings agencies aren’t particularly concerned about Shell’s large debt load. Shell debt is still rated A/stable by Standard & Poor’s, Aa2/negative by Moody’s and AA-/negative by Fitch — all investment grade. Rackspace Hosting, Inc. (RAX) Jumps on Apollo Buyout However, Raymond James analyst Jean-Pierre Dmirdjian believes Royal Dutch Shell’s balance sheet could actually get worse before it gets better. Earlier this month, Dmirdjian questioned Shell’s ability to grow its free cash flow and continue to pay its dividend in the current “unsupportive oil price environment.” If Bank of America’s projections are correct, RDS.B could morph into one of the best long-term value stocks in the market by the middle of next year. Analyst Savita Subramanian is “Overweight” energy stocks and believes crude oil will hit $69/bbl by summer 2017. It seems clear that if oil prices rise, RDS.B stock could easily be one of the best value/dividend combos in the market. However, crude oil has proven to be volatile and unpredictable in the last two years. The market doesn’t seem to trust RDS.B stock just yet. But the window to buy the dip in Shell stock before the market re-gains its confidence may be closing. As of this writing, Wayne Duggan was long RDS.B.

(Thankstelfair) JAMES DETAR 8/26/2016 Reprints Big Lots (BIG) easily beat second-quarter profit estimates Friday morning, but shares quickly reversed lower amid ongoing concerns about retailers and discounters in particular. The report followed a steep sell-off in Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR). The dollar stores missed Wall Street earnings targets, and Dollar General cut its full-year sales forecast amid intense competition, as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) was preparing to slash prices, and as Amazon.com (AMZN) continued to expand its online retail footprint. Big Lots, which operates more than 1,400 closeout stores in 47 states, said Q2 earnings per share minus one-time items climbed 30% to 52 cents, easily topping estimates of 40 cents. It was the third quarter in a row of better-than-expected earnings. Revenue dipped slightly to $1.2 billion from $1.21 billion a year earlier, just missing projections for $1.216 billion. Comparable store sales edged up 0.3%. For Q3, Big Lots sees diluted EPS between a 4 cent loss and a 1 cent gain. Consensus is for a 1-cent loss. The company expects sales at stores open more than a year to be flat to up 2% vs. the same quarter a year earlier. For Q4, Big Lots sees adjusted EPS of $2.18-$2.23, with same-store sales flat to up 2%. Analysts had expected Q4 EPS of $2.21. Big Lots has seen weak revenue for more than two years, reporting growth in a range of minus 1% to plus 1% every quarter in that period. Its earnings growth, however, has mostly in double digits due to cost control measures. Big Lots opened higher on the stock market today, but it soon reversed and traded down 4.5% to 50.57 in very heavy volume, below the 50-day moving average. The stock fell 4.3% on Thursday, dropping below its 50-day line intraday but closing above that support area. Thursday's move did push Big Lots slightly below a 53.45 entry point cleared in late July. The high-volume selling below the 10-week line is a clear sell signal. IBD'S TAKE: Retail earnings and stocks have been uneven in recent weeks, with discounters no exception. But one specialty discounter has performed well since its July 2015 IPO and is setting up in a bullish consolidation. Check out this IBD Stock Analysis of Ollie's Bargain Outlet, which reports earnings next week. Dollar General fell 0.15% after closing down 17.6% Thursday. Dollar Tree ended flat after losing nearly 10% Thursday. Wal-Mart dipped 0.1% and Amazon advanced 1.3%.

Dollar stores such as Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG) were hammered in response to their tepid fiscal second-quarter earnings and outlooks. All signs pointed to the following rare occurrence happening. Big-time deflation in consumable goods like milk, which has the effect of pulling down sales for companies that are expected to deliver huge sales gains. For some reason, Wall Street and the home gamers never seem to factor in inflation and deflation in their modeling and often get surprised when their large swings in either direction. Walmart (WMT) has been the price aggressor in the retail business year to date and has managed to rip off more than seven-straight quarters of traffic gains. These gains are coming at the expense of dollar stores. Food stamp reductions that began in April are a sales killer for dollar stores. Both of the main dollar stores continue down the road of mind-boggling new store opening/remodeling plans, which is creating inefficiencies in a business model that can't afford to have any. The million-dollar question today is whether to begin building positions in these once-high flyers. After all, they remain solid long-term growers, have good moats around their business and serve a critical function in society. I spent the night reviewing both quarters and earnings calls and came away less than enthused, for now, on the companies. Here are several key factors that should leave you on the sidelines. Pricing War I am in the process of doing a longer piece on this, but my general sense was that the discounters have entered a pre-holiday-season price war. Judging by the comments on pricing from Dollar General and Dollar Tree (and my knowledge of the situation at Walmart), each company has begun lowering prices on key food and household products in an effort to drive traffic. For example, Dollar General has dropped the price on 450 of its top-performing products across many of its stores. I think these new initiatives will come at the expense of margins for the balance of the year and that Wall Street is still underestimating the impact. Shout out to Walmart -- you finally have the dollar stores playing catch-up. Cannibalization Intensifies Dollar stores thrive on efficiencies in terms of store design (it's no frills, few employees on hand) and transportation. One way to create those efficiencies is to open stores right around the block from each other, which both dollar stores have done. But I think both of the companies are starting to run into a key problem from their pursuit of efficiencies by opening hundreds of stores over the past five years: cannibalization. In other words, the companies are no longer growing the market for their services, rather just shifting sales in the community among stores. This is a structural issue and one that Wall Street is probably not too keen on factoring into its forward outlook. But what it's likely to cause is slower sales growth and possibly lower returns on investment. Food Stamp Cut Let me provide some background on this because clearly investors were caught off guard. The thinking on the food stamp cuts that began in April was that increasingly, poor people would live at the dollar stores each week. That hasn't played out. Starting this year, unemployed food stamp applicants between 18 and 49 years old who are not disabled or raising minor children, will only qualify for the food stamp program for three months during a three-year period. So, those consumers who no longer qualify for the food stamp program lost their benefits April 1. The change impacted roughly 500,000 to 1 million people. As a result of this, dollar stores are seeing fewer visits to their stores -- if someone doesn't have any money, then they can't buy essentials. Moreover, when those affected visit the stores with whatever money they have, they are buying fewer items and skipping the higher-margin discretionary departments such as apparel. So, the dollar stores are being forced to drop their prices. I think this will remain a headwind for the sector this year. Perhaps next year its impact will die down as the labor market picks up (or so we hope) and these folks returning to paying jobs. But for now it's a structural impediment for the dollar stores.

As with many earnings seasons, some companies' EPSs exceeded estimates, but revenue fell shy of expectations. Some retailers offered a soft outlook, limiting stock movement. And, there were some companies like Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) that delivered better-than-expected EPS and revenue. Although investors reacted to Wal-Mart's results positively, the stock gave away more than what it gained after the results. Related Link: The Market In 5 Minutes: Jackson Hole In Focus One of the possible reasons for investors' sentiments turning negative on such stocks could be the concern on store traffic, which hurt companies like Express, Inc. (NYSE: EXPR) in the second quarter. Despite a mixed bag of results, some of the retailers are still gaining considerably while others are on a losing streak. Let's look at the performance of five strong and five poor performs. 5 Poor Performers Express: Down over 25 percent on the week after reporting on August 24. Dollar General Corp.

By John Seiler Former Editorial Writer at the Orange County Register Friday, August 26th, 2016 It passes strange that, after so many scandals, the Veterans Administration is a being held up as a model for prescription drug prices. But that’s just what Proposition 61 does. The Ballot Summary reads: “Prohibits state agencies from buying any prescription drug from a drug manufacturer at any price over the lowest price paid for the same drug by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, except as may be required by federal law.” I’m a U.S. Army veteran and sometimes use the VA. Right now it’s my only medical insurance. Although the care can be quite good, and I like the doctors and other medics I’ve worked with, the real problem is that it’s a big government bureaucracy that needs to be pushed, sometimes pushed hard, to get things done. That’s why John Cooper, a spokesman for Concerned Veterans for America, said in April, “The VA is still struggling with a lack of accountability, an inability to properly manage a budget rapidly approaching $200 billion, and a failure to provide veterans with timely access to care and benefits.” And is the VA the best model for low-cost prescriptions? For generic drugs, according to the VA’s site, “Prescriptions: 30-day or less supply for certain Veterans: $8. 30-day or less supply for higher income Veterans.” (Some veterans, such as those who are wounded or former POWs, receive all medical care free.) But for my two blood-pressure prescriptions, I pay $4 each at Walmart. Perhaps the difference in cost favors the VA for non-generic drugs. But for me, at least, and millions of other veterans, the private-sector is the way to save money. Of course, I realize Walmart offers its low price to get me to come into the store to buy mass quantities of the stuff on its shelves. But that is the point: The private sector finds ways to cut costs because it is competing. The government doesn’t. I wish the California Public Employees’ Retirement System would stay out of politics and just maximize its funds’ value. However, in this case Prop. 61 directly would affect CalPERS, according to its analysis: “As related to CalPERS, then, the Act would: Apply the VA price ceiling to programs where the state is the ultimate payer for a drug, which could include CalPERS even if CalPERS does not purchase the drug directly…. Require responsible state agencies, such as CalPERS, to enter into agreements with drug manufacturers for further price reductions so that the net cost of the drug, as determined by the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), is the same or less than the lowest price paid for the same drug by the VA.” And: “The Legislative Analyst’s Office, in its May 2016 report … indicated that the overall fiscal effect of the Act is ‘highly uncertain’ due to ‘uncertainty around (1) whether the lowest prices the VA pays for prescriptions drugs are publicly available and (2) how drug manufacturers would respond in the market if this measure were enacted.’” And: “The Act could cause pharmaceutical manufacturers to increase their VA prices instead of lowering the prices paid by California state purchasers such as Medi-Cal and CalPERS.” Sounds like higher costs and even more bureaucracy. And given that CalPERS has big financial problems, suffering its worst year of returns since 2009, any extra costs imposed by Prop. 61 ultimately would be withdrawn from taxpayers like an unneeded blood sample. The Yes on 61 campaign released a memo attacking CalPERS: “The analysis also underestimates the market power that CalPERS will have when negotiating drug prices pursuant to the measure…. [T]he analysis ignores crucial evidence from the pharmaceutical industry. The industry itself predicts that the measure would lower their profits and cause other states to pass similar legislation. Both of these outcomes would be exceedingly unlikely if this Act produces higher drug prices or reduced drug sales in California.” But how is “lower…profits” good for the drug industry? In a capitalist system, profits are used to fund research and development for new products, in this case wonder drugs to save us. (Granted, Big Pharma gets us hooked on too many of its potions and lobbies against alternative medicines and treatments; but that’s another matter.) The memo quotes the publication Pharma Exec from Dec. 16, 2015, with “emphasis added”: “If the voters of California approve this proposition it would establish an incredibly deep, mandatory discount – in essence a ‘price control’ – for the public purchase of prescription drugs in America’s largest state.” Price controls? How’s that working in Venezuela? From the days of Emperor Diocletian’s Edict on Maximum Prices in 301 in ancient Rome until today, price controls always cause scarcity and misery. The Yes on 61 campaign does highlight the problem of expensive medications. But the solution there is to reduce, not increase, government controls on medications. My longtime Register colleague the late Alan Bock used to urge that the FDA insist only that drugs be safe, not efficacious. Efficacy would be left to the determination of doctor and patient. Such a change would drastically cut the cost of developing new drugs. And Obamacare, the risibly named Affordable Care Act, has forced premiums to rise faster than the thermometer under the tongue of someone with a bad fever. All of this – Prop. 61, Obamacare, the inevitable Hillarycare II – is intended to push us into a single-payer, government-run system like they have in Canada, Venezuela or Cuba. If that’s the case, I might as well move to Cuba for the cheap stogies. Longtime California commentator John Seiler’s email: writejohnseiler@gmail.com.

"Following" : "Follow"}} August 26, 2016 8:41am   Comments Share: Related WMT December Price Changes At Wal-Mart Fast Money Traders Share Their Trump Picks: Ford, General Motors, Kansas City Southern Old Retail Gasps, As Foreign Online Retailers Rally (Investor's Business Daily) Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT)'s turnaround story appears to be playing out as planned, and the company is well positioned for continued growth, especially in the domestic business. However, with a lot of the focus on the domestic business, many investors may be ignoring Wal-Mart's international problems, especially in the United Kingdom where its grocery store, Asda, accounted for 8 percent of Wal-Mart's total sales in 2014. As noted by Bloomberg Gadfly's Chris Hughes, Wal-Mart bought the U.K.-based supermarket in 1999 for roughly $9 billion. Today, its same-store sales have plunged to nearly negative 8 percent compared to nearly 4 percent position in the first quarter of 2013. While Wal-Mart has a reputation of delivering low prices to consumer, in Europe, the German-based discounted no-frills supermarket chain Aldi and Lidl hold that reputation, and consumers are flocking towards the German brands. Related Link: Wal-Mart's Turnaround Story May Be The Real Deal Asda has tried to fight back, but it is losing a price war, not only against the German chains, but against the U.K.'s other large chains, J Sainsbury, WM Morrison Supermarkets and Tesco. So Now What Wal-Mart hired a new CEO, Sean Clarke, to oversee Asda and his priority is to increase market share rather than protecting profit. A sale of the company to a private equity firm that offers Wal-Mart a quick out from the market is "probably the last thing" on the company's mind right now. However, a sale would make sense, Hughes suggested, but it may have to come from an overseas firm. International private equity firms are "flush with funds," and a potential turnaround opportunity in Asda is attractive. Nevertheless, Hughes added that it is "hard to identify a foreign buyer that really needs to enter the U.K." Bottom line, Hughes stated Asda isn't yet a "big enough problem" for Wal-Mart to make a decision on how to proceed today, but the "sell-by date " for any deal could drift away.

Opinion Op-Ed Op-Ed How the charter school lobby is changing the Democratic Party Steve Barr enters L.A.'s mayoral race Los Angeles Times An attorney looks on as Steve Barr signs the initial paperwork that the city and state require for candidates to run for office, at Barr's home in Silver Lake on June 24. Barr has announced that he will challenge L.A.'s incumbent Eric Garcetti for the mayoralty next year. An attorney looks on as Steve Barr signs the initial paperwork that the city and state require for candidates to run for office, at Barr's home in Silver Lake on June 24. Barr has announced that he will challenge L.A.'s incumbent Eric Garcetti for the mayoralty next year. (Los Angeles Times) Harold Meyerson At a time when Democrats and their party are, by virtually every index, moving left, a powerful center-right pressure group within the liberal universe has nonetheless sprung up. Funded by billionaires and arrayed against unions, it is increasingly contesting for power in city halls and statehouses where Democrats already govern. That’s not how the charter school lobby is customarily described, I’ll allow, but it’s most certainly what it’s become. Caption BSO confirms multiple people shot and one in custody at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport According to a spokesperson for the Broward Sheriff’s Office, multiple people have been shot and one person is in custody after shots were fired at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.

It's snowing in the Sierra. It started snowing Jan. 4, and you can already see what Mother Nature has wrought. Next year, the progressive mayors of America’s two largest and overwhelmingly Democratic cities – New York’s Bill de Blasio and Los Angeles’ Eric Garcetti – will each stand for reelection. So far, the only visible challenger to Garcetti’s bid is Steve Barr, founder of the Green Dot charter schools. In New York, de Blasio’s critics have suggested that Success Academy Charter Chief Executive Eva Moskowitz would be the candidate most likely to depose the mayor, though Moskowitz has denied any interest in running. This abrupt elevation (or self-elevation) of today’s charter school entrepreneurs into tomorrow’s civic leaders may seem surprising, but it’s part of a larger pattern. In California, political action committees funded by charter school backers have become among the largest donors to centrist Democratic state legislators who not only favor expanding charters at the expense of school districts, but also have blocked some of Gov. Jerry Brown’s more liberal initiatives. In New York’s upcoming primary, such longtime charter supporters as Wal-Mart heiress Alice Walton have given hundreds of thousands of dollars to a PAC seeking to unseat several Democratic legislators who’ve defended the role and budget of traditional public schools. In future decades, historians will have to grapple with how charter schools became the cause celebre of centrist billionaires – from Walton to Bloomberg to Broad – in an age of plutocracy. The historians shouldn’t dismiss the good intentions behind the billionaires’ impulse: the desire to provide students growing up in poverty with the best education possible. But neither should they dismiss their self-exculpation in singling out the deficiencies, both real and exaggerated, of public education as the central reason for the evisceration of the middle class.  In their mix of good intentions and self-serving blindness, the billionaire education reformers have much in common with ... their Gilded Age predecessors. If Wal-Mart, the corporation from which Walton derives her wealth, hadn’t compelled its suppliers to make their products abroad to reduce the price of their goods, more public school students’ parents might have the kind of stable employment and adequate incomes that foster learning-friendly upbringings. Despite the fact that our traditional ladders of mobility – decent blue-collar and service sector jobs, unions, cross-class marriages – have largely collapsed, seemingly sentient billionaires insist that teachers and their unions are the main obstacles blocking young people’s escape from poverty. The poor, or their tribunes, don’t necessarily agree. In the past couple of weeks, both the Movement for Black Lives (50 organizations active in the Black Lives Matter movement) and the NAACP passed resolutions declaring that charter schools increase segregation and leave school districts with both fewer resources and a more challenging student body. While many in minority communities dispute these views, there’s clearly some real skepticism about the merits of charterizing education among the very people it purports to help. That’s one reason the Steve Barrs and Eva Moskowitzes aren’t likely to be supplanting their mayors next year. But the charter advocates don’t need to win the high-visibility offices to prevail. By spending sufficiently to shift the composition of Democratic caucuses in legislatures, city councils or school boards to the right, they can undermine public education. Whether they mean to or not, by backing more conservative Democrats, they can also impede unrelated progressive initiatives for greater environmental protections and worker rights. And by making Democratic elected officials even more dependent on the mega-donations of the 1%, they make campaign finance reform all the harder to win. In their mix of good intentions and self-serving blindness, the billionaire education reformers have much in common with some of the upper-class progressives of a century ago, another time of great wealth and pervasive poverty. Some of those progressives, in the tradition of Jane Addams, genuinely sought to diminish the economy’s structural inequities, but others focused more on the presumed moral deficiencies and lack of discipline of the poor. Whatever the merits of charters, the very rich who see them as the great equalizer are no closer to the mark than their Gilded Age predecessors who preached temperance as the answer to squalor.

NEW YORK — U.S. retailers including J.C. Penney and Wal-Mart are scrutinizing whether sheets Welspun India Ltd. said were high-end Egyptian cotton were in fact cheaper knock-offs, a question that has sent the textile company's shares plunging. Since Target announced Friday that it was pulling the sheets from its stores and online and was terminating its relationship with the company, other retailers have launched investigations into the certification claims from Welspun, one of India's largest textile makers. Target said an investigation confirmed that Welspun used another type of non-Egyptian cotton between August 2014 and July, and the retailer is offering refunds to its RedCard and Target.com customers who bought the sheets during that time. Target declined to say what spurred its investigation. Welspun told investors this week it's conducting an audit. It said in a conference call that the product in question with Target accounts for about 1 percent of the textile company's sales. Welspun's shares have fallen more than 40 percent since Friday on the BSE, the largest exchange in India, and were down 8 percent Thursday. Wal-Mart spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said Welspun supplies the retailer with a number of products, including some of the sheets. She said Wal-Mart is reviewing Welspun's certification records and plans to have “additional conversations” with the company. Bed, Bath & Beyond said it is working with an independent third party to audit the supply chain and will “aggressively pursue its investigation and take appropriate action, if needed.” Penney said it was too early in its review to determine what actions may be necessary. Macy's said Welspun produces some of the chain's private-brand products but they are not involved in this situation because they are not marketed as 100 percent Egyptian cotton. But it said it is monitoring developments. More Business Mt.

Earnings excluding one-time items rose to 321 million rand ($23 million) from 269 million rand a year earlier, the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement on Thursday. Sales increased 8.7 percent to 42 billion rand and the company reduced the half-year dividend by 49 percent to 74.1 South African cents. Slower economic growth and the effect of the weaker rand on the price of imports dampened consumer spending on durable goods, the company said. In contrast, food and liquor sales rose by 13 percent as the company increased its market share, Chief Executive Officer Guy Hayward told reporters on a conference call. The divergence in performance reflects a “defensive economic environment where food does better than non food,” he said. “Our drive into food of a few years ago is paying for itself.” ‘Quietly Confident’ South African retailers have wrestled this year with challenges including drought-related food-price inflation, weak domestic confidence and rising interest rates. While consumer spending is likely to remain constrained and food prices will probably rise further in the second half of the year, conditions may improve in 2017, Hayward said. “We are quietly confident about next year,” he said in a presentation in Johannesburg. “But the second half of this year we think will be exceptionally tough.” The shares erased declines to trade 1 percent higher at 135.28 rand by 11:51 a.m. in Johannesburg, extending the year’s gain to 35 percent. Massmart is the best performer on the FTSE/JSE Africa General Retailers Index in 2016. Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas and the world’s largest retailer, bought a controlling stake in Massmart in 2011 to take advantage of African growth. Massmart’s stores in the rest of Africa increased sales by 23 percent, or 17 percent on a constant local-currency basis, the retailer said. The company expects to open five new stores outside of South Africa in the next two years, Hayward said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(AP) — Fresh-cut vegetables are being recalled from grocery, discount and convenience stores across the Southeast because the food may be contaminated with potentially fatal Listeria bacteria. Conroe, Texas-based Country Fresh Inc. said Friday that the recall involves its vegetable products shipped to retailers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. The vegetables carried the Country Fresh and store labels at Bi-Lo, Fresh Point, Harris Teeter, Publix, QuikTrip, Spinx, Walmart and Winn-Dixie stores. The recalled items had “best if used by” dates of Aug. 7 through 19. Listeria can cause serious infections in the young or frail. Healthy people may suffer high fever, severe headache and other symptoms. One person in Connecticut died during a four-state outbreak linked to frozen vegetables recalled earlier this year. The complete FDA announcement about the recall is below- Country Fresh, Inc.281-453-3305 Announcement August 26, 2016.  Country Fresh, LLC. of Conroe, Texas, is recalling 30,000 cases of various fresh-cut vegetable products (product descriptions attached), because they have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.  Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeriainfection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. The product in question was shipped to retailers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia under the Country Fresh and store brand labels described in the product listing. The product bears “BEST IF USED BY” dates between August 7, 2016 (8/7/16) through August 19, 2016 (8/19/16).  The product is in either a clear plastic container as labeled below or in Styrofoam trays overwrapped with clear plastic film as labeled below.  No products except those on this list are subject to this recall. To date, no illnesses have been confirmed by public health authorities. “We are treating this incident very seriously because we want to ensure that our customers are provided with only the safest, most wholesome, and high-quality products available,” said Max Payen, Country Fresh’s Director of Food Safety.  The potential for contamination was uncovered as the result of a single routine sample taken at a retail store by the Georgia Department of Agriculture, which revealed the finished product tested positive for the bacteria.  The company has ceased distribution of the affected product as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Country Fresh continue their investigation as to what caused the problem.  This recall is being undertaken with the knowledge of the FDA. Consumers who have purchased any of these products are urged to return it to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact the company at 281-453-3305, Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. – 5 p.m. CDT.

The vegetables carry the Country Fresh and store labels at Harris Teeter, Walmart, Bi-Lo, Fresh Point, Publix, QuikTrip, Spinx and Winn-Dixie. The recalled items have “best if used by” dates of August 7th through the 19th.

It is a Christian social service center for the homeless and poor at 1430 Pacific Ave. in Long Beach. The following is an interview with some of the homeless men living at the Mission. They are basically recovering from alcohol and drug addiction. Steve, age 63, was born in Detroit, Michigan. Steve was on the Detroit Police Department for a short time and left because of a medical problem. There was a big snow storm in Detroit and Steve thought it was best to travel to California. It was here that he worked as a truck driver off and on over the years. Today, he enjoys reading books and swimming occasionally. Anthony, is age 52 and his nickname is “the Reverend.” He was born in Providence, Rhode Island and he left because he thought California offered him more work as a carpenter. He also found employment as an assistant chef in some restaurants. Today he is involved in ministry and relaxes listening to music. Kevin, age 55 was born Long Beach, California. All his life he was involved in retail sales for stores like Walmart and Marshals. Today he spends most of his time watching different sports on television and lots of old time movies. Terri, age 43 was born in Baltimore, Maryland. For a large part of his life he worked for a postal contractor sorting out mail. He also filled in his working time as a part time security officer. Today his enjoyment is watching movies most of the afternoon. Chris, 29 was born in San Pedro. His primary employment is being a carpenter specializing in hardwood floors. He likes to try and stay in shape by exercising, swimming and snowboarding when he can get up to the mountains. David, age 19 was born in Torrance. David says his mother left him to move back to Mexico. He elected to stay in California and has sought work in construction. To pass his spare time he likes to play the guitar, and play the drums if he has any to play. The homeless population in the greater part of Long beach is rising every year. To some extent it is their good fortune to live in California and not in the mid-west where the winter months really take a toll in lives. A large portion of the homeless are women and children. The Long Beach Rescue Mission is helping to provide a way for keeping the homeless off the streets and getting them on the road to recovery. By having a nice shelter, good food and spiritual guidance, this in itself helps those to recover from the homeless cycle induced by alcohol and drug addiction. With some basic work-related training, and our support many will return to normal lives in today’s society. Most of the homeless are referred to the mission from the Long Beach Police Department, local hospitals, case workers and many are walk-ins. The mission provides food, clothing, shelter and spiritual guidance to everyone. The mission includes a seven day emergency shelter, case management and a one year social rehabilitation program, and continued education. If anyone thought they might want to volunteer at the mission you can call 562-591-1292 or go on their website lbrm.org.

 Sears workers reveal why the company is bleeding cash Hayley Peterson Aug. 27, 2016, 7:11 PM 234,512 facebook linkedin twitter email print A worker unpacks televisions at a Sears in Schaumburg, Illinois, near Chicago. Reuters Sears is bleeding cash. The company's cash and equivalents have fallen to $276 million from $1.8 billion a year ago, Sears said Thursday. The company's sales have been falling for years and it has been shutting down stores, selling real estate, and spinning off brands to stem the bleeding. Since 2007, Sears has closed half of its locations — which include Sears and Kmart stores — and eliminated more than 137,000 jobs. Some employees have predicted that the rest of the company's physical stores will close within the next two years. The stores are severely understaffed, with some operating on less than half of the employees they need, according to workers who spoke to Business Insider. Not only are the stores firing people, but they are also cutting labor hours for the workers that remain, according to the employees. In some cases, stores are operating with just one or two cashiers and sometimes no cashiers at all, they said. That's making it increasingly difficult to hire and retain experienced workers, according to a former Kmart employee of 41 years, who said that she was laid off in February. She told Business Insider that her store's employees hadn't seen raises in eight years. She blames the company's CEO, Eddie Lampert, for the company's downfall. "Lampert has taken this company and, with pompous arrogance, has destroyed it," she said. "Customer care is vital to a retail business. Lampert just couldn't understand that." Sears Workers also said that the stores are suffering structurally from a lack of investment. An employee who currently works for a Sears in Ohio said that his store is rife with issues, from broken walls and escalators to frequent roof leaks. He said that the merchandise on the floor is often torn open, and no one will buy those items. A former assistant manager of Kmart who left the company in 2012 after 12 years said that the company really started going downhill after the introduction of Shop Your Way, a loyalty program that Sears introduced in 2009. The program, which allows customers to earn points for purchases, was confusing and poorly executed, killed profits, slowed down customer service, and featured targeted advertising that was completely off base, the former manager said. He said: "Items scanned per minute decreased from 18 to five items per minute because the program was littered with exclusions and confusion. Several items didn't ring as advertised or generate the points as expected. This resulted in long lines and angry customers. Abandoned carts meant utilizing payroll to return those items back to stock." Sears He said that he and his family shopped at Walmart instead of Sears or Kmart to avoid the confusion of Shop Your Way. "Imagine trying to keep an eye on two children and trying to understand a confusing SYWR [Shop Your Way] offer," he said. "We opted to avoid the confusion and shop Walmart — where the tag or the sign told us what we would pay. No gimmicks." The 41-year employee of Kmart who spoke to Business Insider had similar complaints about Shop Your Way. She said: "[Eddie Lampert's] ideas of reward cards to transform the company were a waste of time and money. If they didn't have a card, you were supposed to enroll them while you have 10 waiting in that one line to check out. Most people were so disgusted when they finally got to pay, they didn't want to apply. They just wanted to pay and go." In response to the employee complaints, Sears spokesman Howard Riefs said that the company encourages workers to provide feedback. "One of our cultural beliefs as a company is to embrace feedback," Riefs said. "We have a variety of ways that associates can give authentic feedback — even anonymously — and would encourage them to do so." He also directed Business Insider to a Sears blog post published last year in which employees shared why they are proud to work for Sears and Kmart. "I am very proud to be part of SHC [Sears Holding Co.]," said Jen Chamberlain, a Sears sales associate in Victor, New York. "From online and in-store shopping to home and car repair services integrating with Shop Your Way, it is truly a high standard of operation for any company." Scott Ogden, an associate store manager in Miami, Florida, said, "I am proud to be part of the SHC team because we all work together on a daily basis to achieve the same common goals. SHC is comprised of great leaders and team members who strive every day to deliver their best results." In addition to speaking with employees, Business Insider also reviewed a message board that workers said they use to communicate with Sears and Kmart employees at other stores. In dozens of messages over the last several weeks, people claiming to work for Sears and Kmart complained about the stores' deterioration. Several people claimed that the quality of the products that Sears and Kmart sell has declined and that no one will buy clearance items regardless of how much they mark down the prices. Sears "Clearance is the standard operating procedure at our store," one person wrote on the message board. "We have at least half of our store on clearance. Too much stuff people don't want ... and what they do buy they will usually return as defective. ... Not long until the end, it will come soon." Another person claiming to work in Sears' automotive section wrote: "Lately the majority of tire shipments consist of Patriot and Radar tires. These are simply cheap crappy tires. We have about 12 sets of Michelin tires left and a handful of Goodyear. Even shipments of their signature RoadHandler tires have slowed down. It's embarrassing when I have to face a customer and explain I just don't have much product to offer." One person said that the stores have deteriorated so much that it's like caring for a "dead body." "Our motto now is 'you can only do what you can do,'" the person wrote. "It's sad to watch what we worked for with pride for so many years to be slain in front of us and then we still have to care for the dead body." Sears Some stores are being inundated by shipments of merchandise several times a week, and they don't have enough employees to move the products from the trucks to the stock rooms, and then to store shelves in a timely manner. "We have been getting shipments of things that we don't need — it seems like they are just trying to empty out of the warehouses," one person wrote. The understaffing appears to be a major issue for many stores. "My store is down to a skeleton staff," one person wrote. Another said that they have a 17-year-old in a managerial position. They wrote: "With new hires only lasting less than a month, experienced employees quitting for better paying and better working conditions we have hardly anyone with any experience to run the store. The worst is that we have a 17-year-old running the office and cash office. He has no experience in either but he is a warm body to fill the job. The end is coming soon, get out while you can."

John Sanchez, 27, of Wayne allegedly tried to steal a cart full of merchandise from the Walmart, Lt. James MacIntosh said. When confronted by employees, he ran from the store and was seen going over the fence into an area beyond the parking lot that quickly falls off into an area with steep drops ranging from 20 to 100 feet, near but not within the Tilcon Quarry property. Police responded at 9:30 p.m. and searched the quarry, then climbed down into the wooded area below the Walmart fence. They found Sanchez on his back at the base of a tall retaining wall, MacIntosh said. He had been hurt badly, with internal injuries and broken bones and became unconscious.

When confronted by employees, he ran from the store and was seen going over the fence into an area beyond the parking lot that quickly falls off into an area with steep drops ranging from 20 to 100 feet, near but not within the Tilcon Quarry property. Police responded at 9:30 p.m. and searched the quarry, then climbed down into the wooded area below the Walmart fence. They found Sanchez on his back at the base of a tall retaining wall, MacIntosh said. He had been hurt badly, with internal injuries and broken bones and became unconscious.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it The just-completed Deepwater Wind project, which sits off the coast of Rhode Island’s Block Island, is set to begin generating power this fall. (Courtesy of Deepwater Wind) By Brady Dennis August 27, 2016 Follow @brady_dennis BLOCK ISLAND, R.I. — The turbines stand like sentinels off the coast of this tiny island, each rising twice as high as the Statue of Liberty. Workers attached the final 240-foot-long blades just days ago, turning the nation’s first offshore wind farm into a reality. When residents look out at the altered horizon from their gray-shingled houses, some see progress, the birth of a promising industry, a way to ditch the 1 million gallons of diesel fuel that Block Island burns each year for power. Others see an expensive eyesore, a boondoggle that they contend will enrich private investors while burdening the state’s ratepayers and doing little to improve daily life here. One group went to federal court in an unsuccessful effort to stall the project. The country’s inaugural foray into offshore wind power is modest compared with the sprawling developments that have existed in Europe for decades. The five-turbine, 30-megawatt project, which is set to start operating this fall, will feed into New England’s electrical grid via underwater cables and provide enough energy to power about 17,000 homes. But here’s what makes it momentous: It exists. From her family’s cottage on Block Island, Rosemarie Ives has a clear view of Deepwater Wind’s five turbines — a project she and her husband have long opposed. (Brady Dennis/The Washington Post) [U.S., Canada and Mexico vow to get half their electricity from clean power by 2025] Building offshore turbines to capture ocean winds has long appealed to U.S. proponents who see them as an untapped source of renewable energy. Yet efforts to jump-start the industry have faltered, none more publicly than the Cape Wind project off Martha’s Vineyard, which has been beset by permitting struggles, legal challenges and opponents with last names such as Koch and Kennedy. In part because of its deliberately small size, only the Block Island wind farm has successfully navigated the legal, regulatory and political hurdles that have tripped up others. Deepwater Wind, the Providence-based company behind the facility, views it as a steppingstone to much bigger endeavors. “Something had to be first,” said the company’s chief executive, Jeff Grybowski. “Some project had to be successful in order for the U.S. to be able to begin taking advantage of this huge resource.” There’s reason to believe offshore wind farms could soon see a U.S. boom. The federal government has awarded nearly a dozen commercial offshore wind leases, including locations off the coasts of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia. This month, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) signed a law requiring utilities to buy a combined 1,600 megawatts of offshore wind power in coming years. In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) wants half the state’s power to come from renewable energy sources by 2030, a plan backed by the state’s Public Service Commission. Deepwater Wind already is angling to build a proposed 15-turbine wind farm off the eastern coast of Long Island, the first phase of what it hopes will be more than 200 turbines to help supply parts of New York and Massachusetts. Other companies have a growing list of offshore projects in various stages of development. ( The Washington Post) Tens of thousands of wind turbines already dot Texas, Iowa and other states, accounting for about 5 percent of the nation’s energy generation. Building these structures on land is cheaper and simpler, but the ocean provides stronger and more reliable winds, and the larger turbines there can, in theory, harness vast amounts of energy. [Why companies like Google and Walmart are buying so much wind power] The wind farm three miles southeast of Block Island has not been universally embraced by the island’s roughly 1,000 year-round residents — a population that swells to 20,000 during the summer, when tourists pour off ferries and fill quaint saltwater-sprayed inns and bars. “We certainly don’t appreciate the turbines ruining the view our family has had for nearly 100 years,” said Rosemarie Ives, whose husband has been coming to a cottage atop Mohegan Bluffs since he was a baby in the 1940s. But Ives, the former mayor of Redmond, Wash., said the couple’s opposition goes beyond aesthetics. They and other detractors say they think officials approved the roughly $300 million project without adequately considering the long-term costs and other effects. They argue that it will do little to lower electricity bills on Block Island, where residents pay among the highest rates in the country. “It was a charade of public process,” Ives said. Mary Jane Balser, who owns Block Island Grocery, typically the island’s biggest electricity consumer, is even more blunt. For years she tried to win grants to connect the island to the mainland electricity grid in an effort to escape the unreliability of diesel generators. “Financially,” she said this month, the wind farm “just makes no sense.” Under a 20-year agreement with regional utility National Grid, Deepwater Wind will receive about 24 cents per kilowatt hour for the power generated by the turbines, with guaranteed increases over time. The average American pays about 12.3 cents. That means Rhode Islanders will pay more for power to subsidize a project benefiting Deepwater’s private investors, Balser said. “It’s not benefiting Block Island. It’s not benefiting Rhode Island,” she said. “The notoriety of being the first in the nation? Can I take that home and eat it?” Grybowski, the Deepwater Wind CEO, is familiar with the criticisms but insists that the wind farm has broad support. Block Island’s town council and residents association backed it, he said, as did environmental groups, three Rhode Island governors, the state’s congressional delegation and the Obama administration. “It’s not unanimous, but I don’t know that there’s an energy project anywhere in the world that is unanimously praised,” he said. “I think the folks who think the process was insufficient are really upset that they didn’t win.” Cristina Archer, a professor in the College of Earth, Ocean and Environment at the University of Delaware, likens offshore wind farms in the United States to personal computers and other technologies that are expensive in the beginning but grow cheaper and more accepted over time. She suspects that the same will happen as the industry grows domestically. “It paves the way,” Archer said of Block Island. Yet she acknowledged that islanders themselves might not see many direct benefits from the project. “The benefit is long term for society in general, not necessarily for the place where the turbines are,” she said. For Norris Pike, a home builder and the island’s second warden, his vote in favor of the project came down in part to a commitment to combat climate change. “It’s the right thing to do. Everybody has to do their part. I believe this is our part,” said Pike, whose family settled here in the 17th century. He estimates that about 70 percent of residents support the project and that the 30 percent who were against it “just tended to be pretty vocal.” He expects to see community gains, such as ecotourism and the mainland power connection, that will include fiber-optic cable that eventually might help improve the island’s notoriously sluggish Internet speeds. “We’ve been running on diesel generators for 80 years,” Pike said. “It’s time to turn them off.” Clifford McGinnes, the octogenarian co-owner of Block Island Power, agrees. “We won’t have these ups and downs that we’ve had with the [diesel] engines,” he said, noting that a recent fire disabled several engines and led to rolling blackouts. “I can’t wait to shut them down. There’s always a problem.” Some Block Islanders are delighted that the smallest town in the smallest state is ground zero for a new renewable energy industry. “Isn’t it awesome?” asked Judy Gray, a retired meteorologist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as she stood on her deck overlooking the wind farm. “I’m what they call a YIMBY — Yes in my back yard.” Gray’s family began coming to the island in the 1930s, and she and her husband settled here full-time when she retired. “People are afraid of what they don’t know,” she said. “I think people will eventually get used to it. I think it’s going to make us a model.” In recent days, Gray has spent hours on her deck with her camera, giddily documenting how the turbines were taking shape. This fall, when their blades at last begin generating electricity, she plans to throw a “wind farm party” to celebrate with friends and neighbors. national health-science Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

(AP) — A mother has been charged in the death of her son who drowned in the pool at a central Alabama apartment while she shopped at Walmart. Al.com reported Friday that 29-year-old Davida Samantha Flint left her 2-year-old son Caden Jemison and two other children at home while she shopped. Homewood police said she initially told them she was home during the incident, but surveillance video from Walmart showed she was at the store when Jemison drowned at the Chastaine Park Apartments on July 26. Jail records show that Flint is charged with reckless manslaughter. She was released from the Jefferson County Jail after posting a $10,000 bond on Thursday.

Print Email Jeff Duncan, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune By Jeff Duncan, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune The Times-Picayune Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 27, 2016 at 1:45 PM, updated August 27, 2016 at 1:46 PM comments MANDEVILLE -- It was a random act of kindness on a random Friday night in a random part of south Louisiana. Just like countless other schools across Louisiana, the Fontainebleau Bulldogs hosted a high school football jamboree Friday night. But this one, against the Live Oak Eagles, was different. Live Oak's 9-7 victory won't be what the Eagles and their 200 or so hearty fans remember from the humid night among the piney woods in St. Tammany Parish. They'll remember the Bulldogs' neighborly hospitality and simple act of human decency. Laura Cahill, left, and Dayna Berthaut display the "We Are One" T-shirts sold by the Fontainebleau High School football team booster club to help raise funds for Live Oak High School.Jeff Duncan, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune Since floods inundated the Baton Rouge area earlier this month, countless people from across the country have volunteered time, energy and money to help the storm victims in their time of need. The good folks at Fontainebleau High School were among them. Fontainebleau sits about 64 miles down I-12 from Live Oak, which is located in the bedroom community of Watson just outside of Denham Springs. The schools share similar demographics and academic missions, but compete athletically in different LHSAA classifications. Consequently, they aren't regular adversaries other than the annual preseason football jamboree game. When Live Oak officials determined the flood-ravaged parish would not have the security or support staff necessary to host the jamboree as scheduled, Fontainebleau officials rallied to the cause. The Bulldogs not only agreed to play host to the Eagles, but they elected to donate all the profits from the jamboree to Live Oak High School. The football team's booster club staged a fundraising night at a local restaurant and sold 240 "We Are One" T-shirts to students, faculty and parents. What's more, school officials lured a couple of local fast-food chains to donate postgame meals for both the junior varsity and varsity teams. Fontainebleau officials presented a check for $2,500 to Live Oak coach Bret Beard between the jamboree games. They didn't do it for publicity. They did it because they cared. "We just decided we wanted to help in any way we could," said Tammy Blocker, the wife of Fontainebleau coach Chris Blocker and a member of the football team's booster club. "And it just took off from there." The night reminded me of a comment former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue made at a press conference in those grim days after Hurricane Katrina: "A friend in need is a friend indeed." The Live Oak football team is a living example of this proverb. The Eagles have both given and received aid during the exhausting past two weeks. Live Oak took on water but not nearly as much as their neighbors in Denham Springs and St. Amant. An aerial photo of Live Oak High School sitting in a lake of water was widely circulated online and in social media. However, the school actually received minimal water. Just three buildings took on water, and school officials were able to quickly remedy the damage. Beard and his staff were able to rescue all of the team's gear and equipment from the field house and eventually remove the debris and dead fish from the waterlogged artificial-turf football field. "The photo looked a lot worse than it was," Beard said. "It ended up being a lot better than I thought it was going to be." Nevertheless, the Eagles were far from unaffected. Beard said between 60 and 70 of his players' homes flooded. Five members of his coaching staff "lost everything," he said. Defensive coordinator Brian Smith, center, sends Live Oak defenders through pre-game drills before the Eagles' jamboree game against Fontainebleau on Friday night.Jeff Duncan, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune Defensive coordinator Brian Smith lost his entire home and three cars when floodwaters from the nearby Amite River swamped his neighborhood in southern Denham Springs. Smith and his wife were rescued by boat from the second story of the house as the floodwater rose to the roofline on Aug. 13. They were deposited in the parking lot of a nearby Wal-Mart, where they spent the next 24 hours marooned with hundreds of other storm victims. "When I got to Wal-Mart, I had my shorts and my shirt," Smith said. "That's all I owned. This guy walked up and gave me a pair of socks and there I was, standing there in the rain in the Wal-Mart parking lot in my socks, nowhere to go, no one to come get you because the water is everywhere. Them 24 hours was just bad. That day was brutal." Beard eventually rescued them, and the Smiths have been living with the head coach ever since. For the first week after the flood, Beard, Smith and about 20 members of the team wake up early and take to the streets to help neighbors and friends gut homes. They'd work all day, then hit the practice field around 5 each night. "We'd work all day and play at night," Beard said. "Realistically, we needed to get back to some stability and some type of normalcy. Some of these are sleeping in beds they never thought they'd sleep in, houses with no walls. Football is their stability, and we needed to get back to it. The kids were ready to get back. They were tired. But their excitement got them through it." The Eagles' enthusiasm and resiliency was evident in the jamboree. The Bulldogs shocked them with a long kickoff return and a 20-yard touchdown run on the first play from scrimmage. Forty seconds into the scrimmage, the Eagles trailed. But they settled down and eventually started to execute on both sides of the ball to edge the hosts 9-7. "They have really responded," Smith said of his team. "You're working all day helping people clean their houses out, lifting all that heavy stuff. Your back's hurtin'. Your hamstrings are hurtin'. You're sore everywhere. But you just want to play some football. That's the bottom line for these kids." Fontainebleau athletic director Ricky Zimmer can sympathize with the Eagles' plight. A former wrestling coach at Chalmette and Andrew Jackson High School, he survived Hurricane Betsy and lost his house in Chalmette to floodwaters in hurricanes Katrina and Rita. He knows the feeling of hopelessness and estrangement from the vagabond existence. Fontainebleau High School boosters welcomed Live Oak to the schools' jamboree with several signs on the fence at the football field.Jeff Duncan, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune "I had 13 feet of water at my house in Chalmette," Zimmer said. "We understand. We know it could have been us. This isn't about football. It's about community." It's been a whirlwind two weeks for Live Oak. Classes are scheduled to start Sept. 12. For the time being, Live Oak will share its facilities with hard-hit Denham Springs High School. Live Oak students will attend class in the morning and Denham Springs in the afternoon. Meanwhile, Beard and Smith will try to ready their team for their home opener against St. Amant on Friday night. The Eagles went 6-4 and won the first playoff game in school history a year ago. Expectations were high in Watson for Beard's second season at the helm. Then Mother Nature blitzed, and the Eagles have been calling audibles ever since. Gestures like the one Fontainebleau made Friday night make the road to recovery a little easier. "There's no words I could ever say to tell them how much I appreciate everything they've done," Beard said of Fontainebleau's gesture. "I'll never be able to thank them. I keep telling people, if this ever happens to you all we want to re-pay you and take care of you the same way you're taking care of us, but, hell, I hope it never happens to you." follow us Twitter Facebook LInkedIn Google+ Pinterest Tumblr Most Read Active Discussions Today's Front Page Today's front page stories delivered to your inbox each morning at 5:30 a.m. Leave this field blank    optional Check here if you do not want to receive additional email offers and information.

Posted: Saturday, August 27, 2016 BUSINESS BEAT: Murphy Oil USA breaks ground in Greenville By Meghan Nelson • Last Updated 10:46 pm on Friday, August 26, 2016 Tweet Murphy Oil USA employees, Greenville Chamber of Commerce members, Mayor Pro-Tem Frances Schuleit and Walmart employees attended Thursday’s groundbreaking of Murphy Oil USA. The gas station will be located on M-57 in front of Walmart and is expected to open the second week in October. — Daily News/Meghan Koglin GREENVILLE — After a long process of planning and preparing, Murphy Oil USA officials broke ground Thursday on the site of a future store. The new gas station will be located on M-57 in front of Walmart, and will offer gas, hot cocoa, soda, milk, lottery tickets, tobacco products, frozen drinks and much more. The store will be open 24/7. “We’re hoping to be open by the middle of October, depending if everything goes smoothly,” said Store Manager Rebecca Buchheister. “The tanks are in. We need to do grating and get that all done. They need the columns for the canopy and the building in. There’s still a lot to do.” Greenville Mayor Pro-Tem Frances Schuleit, center, was among those present. She welcomed Murphy’s and Manager Rebecca Buchheister to Greenville. — Daily News/Meghan Koglin Besides finishing the building, two assistant managers and five cashiers still need to be hired. The hiring process will begin Oct. 1 to be ready to open the store during the second week in October. Buchheister of Port Huron works at the Fort Gratiot Murphy Oil USA, but she’s worked across the state and even in Indianapolis. “Right now, I’m the go-to person to go to other places, so this is an exciting time that I get to move up into a bigger store than what I have right now,” she said. “I have been with the company for 10 years. I have traveled to almost every store in Michigan to work, and I’ve also worked in a store down in Indianapolis. “I’m excited. I can’t wait and I’m happy,” she added with enthusiasm. Greenville Mayor Pro-Tem Frances Schuleit welcomed Buchheister and “the wonderful nationwide company” to Greenville. “We’re thankful for your faith in Greenville,” Schuleit  said. “We are happy to have you and we welcome you.” Greenville Area Chamber of Commerce members also expressed their excitement for the new company. Murphy Oil USA has been in existence since 1996 and has about two dozen stores open throughout the United States. Visit www.murphyoilusa.com online for more information about the company.

The discovery was made shortly after 9 p.m. when firefighters responding to a 911 call about a car on fire, put out the blaze and discovered the charred remains of a person sitting in the driver’s seat. Police have determined that the car belonged to a 59-year-old man, but it is not known whether he was behind the wheel at the time of the incident. According to Laval police spokesperson,  Lieutenant Frédéric Jean, an autopsy will be required to identify the victim. Jean said police do not believe a crime was committed and are trying to determine whether the fire was set accidentally or not. © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

But for golf course owners, it’s much harder to pull the plug on a failing business; as courses fall into disuse, they become suburban zombies – not quite dead, yet far from alive. Is this a market correction and also, why are so many literally going up in flames? Find out more at this link. HOW OUTSIDER BUSINESSES ARE GOING MAINSTREAM Fast Company  reports, “As black market businesses become mainstream, it’s clear that mastering illicit activities can help develop a lot of business acumen. Moonshine. Camel milk. Cannabis. Once only products of the gray and black market economies, decriminalization is bringing a new wave of underground goods to consumers across the U.S. “But while the quality may be better, the commercial recipes are still very much inspired by the bootleg generation.” And then there’s the revenue. States legalizing informal businesses – cannabis being the most obvious example – are finding new revenue opportunities. And once struggling informal entrepreneurs are finding new pathways into mainstream business. Since Tennessee legalized moonshine, its wholesale alcohol beverage tax revenue has grown substantially. Learn more about the huge successes of outsider businesses going mainstream, here. INSIDE BILLIONAIRE JAMES DYSON’S REINVENTION FACTORY Forbes posts, “Dressed in a blue polka-dot oxford and striped Reebok sneakers, James Dyson abruptly veers off a paved path that cuts through his company’s 56-acre compound. The beanpole-thin 69-year-old billionaire pushes his way into some shrubbery and presses his nose right up to the reflective glass that encases his new, top-secret laboratory, a sleek two-story cube that looks like it was beamed directly from Santa Clara to the Cotswolds. To his delight, he can’t make out what his engineers are doing inside. “I hope they are working,” he says, chuckling.” In reality, it’s move-in day at this brand-new $200-million-plus research facility, and on the other side of the glass dozens of young engineers are unpacking their gear and settling into their quarters. Their job at D9, as the building is cryptically known, is to experiment fearlessly, fail constantly and document those failures in company-issued black-and-yellow notebooks, which form the basis for still more experiments, still more failures–and also a corporate sideline in patent litigation. “Very rarely this unending cycle of failure results in a revolutionary new product: the bagless vacuum cleaner (5 years, 5,127 prototypes), the 360 Eye robot (17 years, 1,000-plus prototypes) and the Supersonic hair dryer (4 years, 600 prototypes). But those successes add up: Dyson’s 58 products generated $2.4 billion in sales last year and an estimated $340 million in net profits, even after Dyson reinvested 46% of the company’s Ebitda in R&D, more than rivals such as Electrolux and Techtronic. Dyson owns 100% of the company, which is worth some $4.8 billion.” What’s next in the Dyson lineup of products? Go to this link for a fascinating read. SUPERBOSSES AREN’T AFRAID TO DELEGATE THEIR BIGGEST DECISIONS Harvard Business Review says, “The answer to excessive micromanaging, we’re often told, is to learn to trust our reports, empowering them to make decisions for themselves. Yet that sounds far easier than it actually is. In practice, many bosses fail to delegate because they haven’t cultivated a set of underlying mindsets and practices. Over the past decade, I’ve studied the world’s greatest bosses, extraordinarily successful leaders who have also unleashed vast pipelines of talent. These “superbosses,” as I called them, spanned dozens of industries and included legendary figures such as fast casual restaurant magnate Norman Brinker, packaged foods titan Michael Miles, tech mogul Larry Ellison, hedge fund pioneer Julian Robertson, media icon Oprah Winfrey, and a host of others.” Analyzing these leaders’ careers and business practices, I found that superbosses were expert delegators, ceding degrees of authority and control that would send chills down the spines of ordinary bosses. Would you hand a twenty-something $25 million in seed capital and tell him to go off on his own to manage it? Julian Robertson did. Would you task a young protégé with generating the main strategy for a new real estate development — only two days before a big presentation with investors? If you’re real estate legend Bill Sanders, the answer is yes. “Superbosses embrace a number of specific behaviors and beliefs that enable them to trust their subordinates more deeply, and delegate decision-making authority more aggressively. (Take this assessment to find out if you’re a superboss.)” Find out more at this link. ETHICISTS SCOFF AT CLINTON FOUNDATION TRANSITION PLAN POLITICO posts, “The Clinton Foundation’s vague timetable to limit its involvement with overseas programs, and its insistence that Chelsea Clinton remain on its board, raise red flags for ethics watchdogs even as the charity vows to avoid conflicts of interest in a Hillary Clinton presidency. Foundation President Donna Shalala suggested Tuesday that reorganizing the $2 billion enterprise could not happen overnight. The charity pledged last week not to accept foreign or corporate donations if Clinton is elected.” But Richard Painter, former ethics counsel in the George W. Bush administration, said that if the Clintons really wanted to separate themselves, they could do it tomorrow. “That could be done in one board meeting — change the name, have the board members resign and be replaced with people with no ties to the Clintons. No one in the Clinton family should be there. … That’s an easy step to take. It could be done in an afternoon,” Painter said. Independent trustees with experience at other charities could oversee any necessary changes without jeopardizing programs, he said.” “Questions about how the global philanthropy would sever ties that raise potential conflicts of interest for a President Clinton are the latest controversy surrounding its work. Assertions that donors to the charity got special access to Clinton while she was secretary of state have dogged her campaign.” More on this evolving story at this link. RACHEL MADDOW’S DUEL WITH TRUMP MANAGER KELLYANNE CONWAY Donald Trump has only been doing Fox News these days, but on Wednesday night his new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, gamely ventured into the unfriendly confines of Rachel Maddow’s MSNBC show. What followed was a fascinating, lengthy back-and-forth over the importance of policy to Trump, among many other topics. The whole thing was so riveting that The Washington Post annotated it. Check it out for yourself at this link. STRAIGHT TALKIN’ McCAIN “Facing his toughest reelection fight ever, the Arizona senator looks like the freewheeling presidential contender of 2000,” reports POLITICO. “The dour John McCain of Capitol Hill is on hiatus. In his place, at least for a day: The loose, accessible, happy warrior of Straight Talk Express yesteryear. McCain is deadly serious about winning reelection and continuing his long-running battle against the health care and foreign policies of President Barack Obama.” McCain has plenty weighing on his mind these days, including a wild card Republican nominee for president who’s attacked him personally as well as his state’s growing Latino electorate. A super PAC supporting his primary opponent, Kelli Ward, is receiving a late infusion of money ahead of the Tuesday election, an attempt to embarrass McCain with a poor showing. Though McCain is heavily favored to win that race, he’ll then run into Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (D-Ariz.) in the general, easily the toughest opponent he’s ever faced. Follow this link for the complete story including McCain showing the humorous side of his personality that endeared him to millions in multiple state and national campaigns. HOW ALCOHOL PLAYED A ROLE IN AMERICA’S POLITICS “Booze and presidency has a long and illustrious history in the United States. Whether it’s President Obama’s “Beer Summit” in the Rose Garden or Richard Nixon’s famous trip to China, alcohol has been a necessary part of diplomacy. Historian Mark Will-Weber, author of “Drinking with the Republicans,” joins “CBS This Morning: Saturday” to share some of the presidents’ boozy stories in office.” Did President Harding actually stash a fifth in his golf bag and was Nixon a “light-weight” drinker? Get the boozy facts from America’s political past by clicking here. RYAN LOCHTE TURNS EXPERTLY FROM APOLOGY TOUR TO COMEBACK “Ryan Lochte lost all his big sponsorship deals after his idiocy down in Brazil during the Olympics. Today, you might say he’s failing upward, or something,” reports MarketPlace. Lochte has been on what you might call an apology tour, giving interviews and admitting  his story was “over-exaggerated.” But today, Pine Brothers cough drops signed him up, saying “Just as Pine Bros. is forgiving to your throat, the company asks the public for a little forgiveness for an American swimming legend.” Cheesy and opportunistic all at once. And for other huge “Lochte Redemption news” you can get the scoop by clicking here. FOR THE COLONEL, IT WASN’T ‘FINGER-LICKIN’ The New York Times says, “A small boy, seated at a table in Kentucky Fried Chicken store in Greenwich Village paled and almost dropped the extra‐crispy drumstick he was about to bite into yesterday as he looked up and saw none other than the Kentucky Colonel himself, Harland Sanders, every inch his television image with flowing white hair, trim goatee and blazing white suit.” Looking over to the boy’s mother who was managing a thin smile of disbelief, the colonel boomed, “Ah, madam, I bet you never thought it was true. But you, boy, you never doubted it, did you?” And then he handed the child signed photograph of himself. “This unannounced inspection visit to the Kentucky Fried Chicken store on the Avenue of the Americas near Eighth Street followed a prebirthday luncheon for the colonel at the Coach House. Today the colonel’s 86th birthday will be celebrated with a luncheon at “21.” But driving back from lunch yesterday in the colonel’s limousine, I noticed this Kentucky Fried store, at which I had purchased some of the worst fried chicken I’ve ever eaten in my life.” Oh no. The Colonel was a purist with high standards. What’s going on? “Wing” it over to this link to find out. PSYCHEDELIC DRUG INSPIRED BEATLES’ MASTERPIECE “The story of Revolver began in a night of hell and illumination.” reports Rolling Stone. “We’ve had LSD,” John Lennon told George Harrison. But it “also opened wounds that never healed.” For a great read, trip on over to this link.

A 25-year-old catcher hung back. Matt Paré chatted with teammates and underwent a long treatment session as other Augusta GreenJackets players exited through a clubhouse door wedged open with a broken bat. He kept himself awake with a marathon shower. By the time Paré dressed, he had the clubhouse to himself, along with what was left of the GreenJackets' postgame buffet. "What have we got, Sarge?" he called toward clubhouse manager Kristopher Nichols, a former Army drill sergeant who appreciates - and usually rewards - Paré's resourcefulness. Paré is the oldest player for the San Francisco Giants' Class-A affiliate, and he begins most homestands by waiting out his teammates in order to stockpile free food. Far away from Major League Baseball's mighty salaries and Hollywood glitz, Paré is among the thousands of minor leaguers who survive on baseball earnings below the federal poverty line. Baseball has in recent years parlayed renewed popularity into record earnings, leveraging apparel and media demands into $9.5 billion in revenue last year; each of its 30 franchises averaged $23 million in profits in 2015, and many of their minor league affiliates saw attendance figures and team values continue a steady climb. But the overwhelming majority of players in professional baseball's extensive player development system never see a cut of that wealth. More than 80 percent of draft picks will never reach the big leagues, and most live on salaries of less than $10,000 per season; the starting salary for a first-year player, paid only during the regular season, is $1,100. "You always question yourself: Should I be doing this?" said Pare, who says he's making about $7,500 in salary during this 22-week season - a little more than $340 a week, or about $8.50 an hour. Paré shares a two-bedroom apartment with three teammates. He has, in four years as a professional ballplayer, accumulated a mountain of credit card debt. His experience is typical among players on pro baseball's ground floor, highlighting that financial struggle is, as much as promo nights and floodlit nostalgia, a minor league tradition. One that might, according to a lawsuit filed against Major League Baseball two years ago, violate federal and state minimum wage laws. "The organization traces its roots to the nineteenth century," reads the suit, filed in a California district court and led by 41 former players. "Unfortunately for many of its employees, its wage and labor practices remain stuck there." MLB has denied that its organizational structure is unlawful and rather provides opportunity to thousands of young athletes who want to make it to the big leagues. Indeed, many players say the sacrifices are worth it. "In reality I just wanted a chance," said Wilmer Difo, a Dominican-born player who, before being called up by the Washington Nationals last year, spent five seasons in the minor leagues and spent the majority of the 2013 season sleeping on an air mattress in an apartment with five other players. "That's everyone's dream, to get to the major leagues. But it's not always going to be like that. Not everyone. Unfortunately, not everyone, but there are a lot of people that depend on it anyway." Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred indicated to reporters in July that additional regulation could ultimately lead to smaller minor league rosters or fewer teams. The lawsuit has nonetheless turned a spotlight on a shadowy corner of a game in which players routinely put in 60-hour work weeks and must face continual personal and professional obstacles in the name of chasing a dream. Athletes from Latin America are particularly at risk. Many come to the United States from impoverished backgrounds with little or no knowledge of English, and lack both the cultural understanding of life in the country and network of family and friends that can help ease the burden. They are guaranteed a salary, health insurance and not much else. But there are reasons they keep playing: Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw's $33.8 million annual salary is the game's richest, and the average major league player earns $4.4 million per season. When the GreenJackets' season began, their highest salary belonged to Adam Sonabend, an undrafted 24-year-old catcher. His biweekly paycheck, after taxes, is $671. That's enough for Sonabend to have his own bedroom, which is more than his three roommates can say. GreenJackets pitchers Michael Connolly and Jake McCasland share a room, and Paré sleeps on a mattress on the dining room floor. Before heading home on this July night, Paré loaded a serving bin with chicken thighs and vegetarian lasagna; Nichols encouraged him to take as much as he wants. At nearly midnight, Paré finally headed for the clubhouse door, carrying his bounty with both hands. Barb Rothstein used to stay up late after her husband went to bed, opening beers and listening to the young men's stories. Barb and Bob invited the first of the players on the Norwich Navigators, at the time a New York Yankees Class-AA affiliate, to live rent-free in their Connecticut basement in 1996. Two years later, after visiting a few Latin Americans prospects' apartment shocking for both its grime and the landlord's price gouging, there were a dozen players and two wives spread through the house on futons, a mattress in their living room, sharing a room with their son. "I'm not the warm and fuzzy type," Barb would say much later. "But there was something about their living situations that I just couldn't stand." Some of the tales common on the minor league circuit are amusing: how smaller prospects sometimes climb into the team bus's luggage bin to sleep, the way a good meal on the road is a jug of peanut butter before flies or sweaty fingers contaminate it, that it was a good bet the team's bat boys were paid more per hour than the players. "I would be very confident to say that anyone working in that stadium was making more than we were, no matter what job they had," said Brett Newsome, a former Nationals farmhand and one of dozens of current and former minor leaguers interviewed for this story. Newsome is among the co-plaintiffs in the lawsuit against MLB. Players travel with air mattresses, sometimes the only constant in a life of change, and essentials aren't easy to come by. One former first-round draft pick said teammates often asked him to "over-order" baseball equipment from sponsors and distribute the extras within the clubhouse. Luxuries are even rarer: A trick known throughout the minors is to buy a television from Wal-Mart, use its box as a stand and return the TV on the 89th day of a 90-day return policy for a refund. Other stories are sad. Many of the Dominican players had been discovered in their early teens by buscónes, or searchers, the unlicensed scouts who work on commission and compel young and hopeful athletes to abandon their educations to play baseball full-time. The controversial system, in which players guarantee the buscón up to half of any future signing bonus in exchange for exposure to major league teams, is an inexpensive way for franchises to expand their scouting networks and for poverty-stricken families to go all-in on a high-risk gambit. If a player does eventually sign, he is sent to some faraway outpost to begin the climb through baseball's ranks. From there they attempt to gain footing in a new culture and are taught to play ball without complaints while nonetheless sending portions of their meager earnings to their families back home. Difo said he made between $400 and $500 every two weeks - or, he said in Spanish, "only enough to eat" after sending his mother a couple hundred dollars from each paycheck - until his salary multiplied six-fold when he was added in 2014 to the Nationals' 40-man roster. Another former player, the Venezuela-born pitcher Jose Mejias, signed with the Philadelphia Phillies at age 16 and spoke so little English he only felt comfortable communicating with hand gestures. After a few months, teammates started calling him "El Mudo," or The Mute. John Wesley, a former minor league player and pitching coach, said he used to sneak water to Dominican players because their apartment's tap output was brown and the young men could not spare $1.50 for a bottle. "These poor kids," said Wesley, who coached in the Toronto Blue Jays system. "It's a pyramid scam: Everything goes to the top. Nothing comes down." The Rothsteins, one of many host families who offer housing to minor leaguers, fit dozens of players in their 2,000-square foot house until a few years ago. Barb said they came to love their guests, and when one player moved up the ladder or gave up the dream, another took his place. In 2008, after the Giants took over the Norwich team, a tall 24-year-old pitcher named Garrett Broshuis moved in. He was from small-town Missouri and bookish, and like Barb, he too collected stories. Every once in a while, as he and Barb shared a few of their favorites, he'd wonder aloud if the system would ever change. Broshuis' office window overlooks downtown St. Louis and the Mississippi River, a wall decorated with reminders of an old life and a new one: his rookie card next to his admittance to the Missouri Bar Association. "I still love the game," Broshuis said, though a decade after signing a contract to play professional baseball, he was declaring war on it. In February 2014, he filed the lawsuit against MLB, its 30 franchises and former Commissioner Bud Selig. In it, he referred to the league as a "cartel." A former all-American at Missouri, he had tried, years earlier, to keep quiet and play. When a group of fans in Norwich watched him push-start the broken-down pickup he shared with a teammate, he shook it off as paying his dues. When he invited his then-girlfriend to his meager apartment, finding a room flooded by a neighbor's toilet upstairs, he assured himself brighter days awaited. He chronicled his experiences in articles for the Sporting News, though he squashed the grittier anecdotes and submitted the entries to the Giants for approval. But as the years passed, the stories ate away at his resolve: the Venezuelan teammate who struggled each month to send $20 back home to his pregnant girlfriend, the young pitchers worrying each month about how they'd pay their student loans. He was told by team officials that he was lucky to play, that the system had been in place for decades, that if he wanted to make more money, he should get better. Four days after his final game in 2009, he took the Law School Admission Test and was later accepted into St. Louis University's law school. He spoke with professors about a long-term plan to challenge a system that succeeded in part because the hopeful and desperate athletes continued to accept it for one prevailing reason: They always had. MLB filed an answer to the suit last year, denying the allegations in Broshuis's complaint. A league spokesman declined an interview request for this story, referring The Washington Post to a June statement comparing players to "artists, musicians and other creative professionals who are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act." "Like those professionals," the MLB statement went on, "it is simply impractical to treat professional athletes as hourly employees." Paré was on his 38th consecutive hour awake - games on consecutive nights and in stadiums 426 miles apart, one pitch to the head in the first one, a nine-hour bus ride in which he wasn't allowed to sleep because he was being evaluated for a possible concussion - and now it was approaching midnight. He put the leftover chicken and lasagna into the fridge, and when he opened the sliding pantry door it fell off the track. "Believe it or not," he said of the apartment, "the last place was worse." In this complex west of town, roughly 10 units are filled - packed, in some cases - with GreenJackets players and coaches. In here, the air conditioning rumbles and the front door must be slammed to close; Paré sat on carpet singed in places by a previous tenant, examining the lens on his video camera. All four players in this second-floor apartment hold second jobs at least part of the year. Connolly works construction during offseasons, McCasland is a substitute teacher and Sonabend spends part of the morning hours organizing online inventory for a pharmaceutical company. Neither pays especially well, but it's enough financial oxygen to keep the dream alive. Paré makes YouTube videos that poke fun at the plight of a "homeless minor leaguer," a light-hearted look at the lonely hours and inelegant lifestyle the common fan rarely sees. "You can sponsor a player right now," he implores viewers in one video inspired by those old "Save the Children" ads. Paré ends most videos by soliciting donations, and a good month - he collected $83 in July - means he doesn't have to negotiate food prices at Waffle House. A 26th-round draft pick out of high school by Houston in 2009, Paré elected to play at Boston College rather than accept the Astros' offer, which he said included a $200,000 signing bonus. He tore a meniscus as a sophomore, and scouts never viewed him the same. He wasn't drafted after his junior and senior seasons, but after a tryout in June2013, the Giants offered him a contract - this one offering $1,000 to sign. He met Sonabend, another undrafted former college catcher, at a voluntary camp last year before spring training. They traded stories and agreed that luck and persistence had led them to the professional ranks. Sonabend reached Class-AA Richmond last season, collecting a salary increase because of service time at a higher level, and this spring they were assigned to Augusta. Sonabend and Paré agreed to room together with Connolly and McCasland, collaborating on ways to cut costs: Paré sleeping in the dining room because the other residents pay for the Internet, Sonabend buying eggs a few times a week in exchange for use of Paré's SUV. Evenings are spent at the ballpark or at fan events; Paré has perfected the art of asking boosters for donations. This year the roommates have scored eyedrops, a few jugs of coffee, laundry detergent, a sofa and a potholder set. As Friday turned to Saturday, Paré not yet able to wind down, Connolly and McCasland came in through the front door and one of them wrestled it closed. "I brought lasagna!" Paré announced, but his roommates had stopped at a restaurant on the way home. Connolly wished he had known. "That could've saved me some bucks," the 24-year-old pitcher said. Paré returned his attention to the camera, a few ideas in mind for new videos, and Connolly approached the pantry. The door again fell off the track, and Connolly slammed it. "This whole place is a joke," he said, and all Paré could do was laugh. Paré was living rent-free in a cousin's spare bedroom last fall when the email arrived: "The purpose of this Notice," it read, "is to inform you of the existence of a collective action lawsuit against Major League Baseball." A group of former minor leaguers had formed a movement against the league, and hundreds more were adding their names. He thought about it and talked to people he trusted. He read articles about the attorney who had once played for the same organization now leading a charge against MLB. Paré wondered if, like the 1968 uprising that ultimately led to free agency, a victory here would be good for the game. And in the end, he couldn't be certain it would. He believed the Giants (who through a spokeswoman declined to comment for this article) and MLB had, all told, been good to him. Around 2,300 current and former players would opt-in on the suit, but Paré would not be one of them. He didn't want to take a side. He reported for spring training last February, reconnecting with Sonabend and Connolly, who also received the email but refused to add their names. "If I signed it," Connolly said, "it would almost be like me not appreciating the opportunity." Sonabend saw it similarly. "I knew what I was getting into," he said, "and I worked for it anyway." Last month, a California magistrate judge stripped the suit of its conditional class-action status. A setback, Broshuis admitted, but earlier this month the same judge granted a request to reconsider the class certification; a hearing is scheduled for Dec. 2. For now, Broshuis and the 41 co-plaintiffs wait, and for different reasons so do the young men in the apartment in west Augusta: Paré increasingly realistic about his baseball fate, Sonabend seeing how a former baseball castaway can climb, Connolly defiantly hopeful that the phone will someday ring, a voice on the other end inviting him to a higher level in the game and a better lifestyle. "It's only going to be a couple years and you filter out," Connolly said, "or you get that paycheck everybody dreams about." Early on a Saturday afternoon, another game a few hours away, Paré dressed for work. Sonabend joined him in the den, and they collected their bags. "Is Mike pitching?" Paré asked. "Who's pitching?" Sonabend shrugged. "Ready?" he said. "I'm ready," Paré said, and they walked into the midsummer sun, through a door that didn't want to close.

Without (so far) any consultation, the NHS proposes a massive reorganisation that could include hospital closures and cuts, and these could start within months, just as the NHS suffers its winter overload. Why have things come to this? According to Government figures, the £437 million spent in the first year of the NHS’s existence in 1948-49 is equivalent to £15 billion today. Yet the UK total spent on the NHS is now £116.4 billion, £101.3 billion of which is spent in England. The population is nearly a third larger than in 1948-49; we are 64 million people against the 50 million at the 1951 census, thanks not least to the last Labour government’s mass immigration policies and the EU’s refusal to let us control our borders. Yet this population growth cannot account for such an enormous real increase in spending. The problem is that the NHS is doing things its founders never envisaged. It might not survive It also suffers from grotesque overmanning in non-medical staff, a lack of strategic planning to cope with demographic change, and many of the failures associated with the absence of an effective price mechanism. Without rethinking its whole purpose and method of operation, it will, within a decade or two, simply collapse. Even though this is no longer 1948 – our standard of living, our disposable income, our awareness of the dangers of smoking are all radically different from then – governments have avoided profound NHS reform for decades. The insurers of boy racers who mangle themselves in car accidents should be made to pay for their treatment Labour wouldn’t touch it because of the mythology it has sedulously created: that the NHS, free at point of use and controlled on the shop floor by comrades in the trades unions, for whom it represents a considerable employment opportunity, is “safe” only in Labour’s hands. “Safe” in this context equates to eating up a sixth of public spending without worrying too much about how and where that money is spent. The NHS now employs 1.5 million people. As its website proudly proclaims, only McDonalds, Walmart, the US Defence Department and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army have larger payrolls. It may not have occurred to the NHS that this is not necessarily something to be proud of. Watch | Campaign group warns over hospital closures and cutbacks 01:13 The Tories haven’t addressed the NHS with serious radicalism because they fear reinforcing the Labour mythology: that any reduction in spending, irrespective of how it is found, must prove an underlying Tory hatred of the NHS and, therefore, of the people it serves. This is utter nonsense, but nonsense that has so crippled the Tories that in one whole election campaign – 2001 – they tried not to mention the NHS at all. One hopes the Government has noted the near-death of the Labour Party, and the near-certainty that it will be at least another five years before Britain has a credible Opposition, and will now take reform of the NHS to a hitherto unimagined level. We are in this mess not least because of the refusal by all governments over the past 30 years to think strategically. Lord Fowler, one of the best health ministers Britain has ever had, warned colleagues in the mid-Eighties that the growth in the ageing population would put impossible strains on the NHS. Watch | Simon Stevens: Economic tailspin from Brexit 'severe concern' for NHS 00:31 Large amounts of beds and resources are devoted to elderly people in hospital because there is no place for them in a care home, and they can no longer manage at home. This is scandalous and, next to the dismal state of Britain’s defences, the present Government’s greatest dereliction. An insurance system must be introduced now to provide residential care for the elderly. It would offer dignity for them and take a huge burden off the NHS. A contingency fund must be established for those for whom an insurance scheme would come too late and who lack the resources to fund themselves. There is no way round this in a supposedly civilised society. The NHS must also review what it provides. Except in shocking cases of disfigurement, cosmetic surgery should be a luxury and the province of the private sector. And while I deplore the unhappiness of those men who identify as women, and vice-versa, there can be no obligation on the state to fund such options in the way it funds, say, treatment for cancer. The insurers of boy racers who mangle themselves in car accidents should be made to pay for their treatment. And those who engage in benefit tourism to come to Britain for NHS treatment should be invoiced for it, and pursued until they pay. If such treatment is not life-saving, it should be refused. The big earners 2015/16 | Monthly rates paid for NHS trust interim managers The Government needs to encourage private medicine and especially private GP services, if necessary through tax breaks: our European neighbours spend far more in the private sector than we do, which is one reason why their health services are not collapsing. Wealthy people should be encouraged to use the private sector. Finally, the Government needs to ask whether the NHS needs such a vast direct labour force. Much non-medical work could be contracted out to private sector companies whose staff management and manpower might be more efficient. The ageing population will demand more doctors and nurses, but everything else should be up for review. The NHS boasts that it has cut managers since the late 1998. It needs to cut more, and cut the clerical and blue-collar staff it manages. I don’t dispute that our expectations about modern healthcare make a state health service essential. But I do dispute that we can carry on as we are. The Government seems to begin to understand this. It is now time, while Labour is tearing itself apart, to start to make an ally of the British public on the question.   Follow Telegraph News READ MORE ABOUT: Health Conservative Party Labour Party Show more News latest 07 Jan 2017, 1:43am Live Five dead in Fort Lauderdale airport shooting by suspect 'who told the FBI he was being forced to fight for Isil' 07 Jan 2017, 1:40am Winston Churchill bust set for Oval Office return by Donald Trump 07 Jan 2017, 1:12am US concludes Vladimir Putin ordered campaign to influence US election 'after British intelligence tip-off' 07 Jan 2017, 1:07am Civil servants told to make patriotic case for Brexit 07 Jan 2017, 12:50am Health officials investigate risk of HIV from cosmetic skin treatment  07 Jan 2017, 12:00am Damian Collins: ambulance-chasing lawyers will be the big winners under Section 40 01:16 06 Jan 2017, 10:56pm Who is Mike Pence? former conservative radio host who is a heartbeat away from the presidency 06 Jan 2017, 10:19pm Donald Trump's inauguration: When does he become US president - and who will perform at the ceremony?  06 Jan 2017, 10:00pm Bosses should show commuters caught up in rail strikes 'patience and understanding', Chris Grayling says 06 Jan 2017, 10:00pm Crisis what crisis?

"Perfect timing," says Ayers, 32, of Athens, Ga. An Amazon shopper had complained that one of Ayers's products wasn't authentic. Ayers disputed the claim and provided receipts to back it up. But about two weeks had passed by the time his account was reinstated, and the downtime cost him sales. "I wasn't doing anything shady," says Ayers, who estimates he'll sell $500,000 worth of goods on Amazon this year. "It seems there are a lot of Amazon sellers who aren't doing anything wrong and are getting punished. There's an arbitrary nature to it." He has plenty of company. Attendees at an annual gathering of online merchants in Seattle on Friday said merchants are "living in fear" that they'll be kicked off the site. Most Amazon customers probably don't realize that almost half of the items sold on the site come from third-party merchants. That means a set of kitchen knives could have been plucked from a Walmart bargain rack in Nebraska by a mom-and-pop business looking to profit from a little retail arbitrage. Amazon relies on more than two million merchants like Ayers to keep its website and warehouses stocked with an assortment of goods no brick-and-mortar store could ever match. But the company's relentless focus on customer service means that when Amazon receives a complaint, it's the shopper - not the merchant - who typically gets the benefit of the doubt. "We treat sellers like customers," said Erik Fairleigh, a company spokesman. "The perfect seller experience is seamless self-service that allows the seller to independently run their business. If a seller needs to contact us, we have Seller Support associates available 24 hours a day worldwide, including support for urgent issues with a response in an hour or less." But Ayers and other sellers maintain Amazon is too quick to suspend its business partners and too slow to review their appeals, cutting off their primary revenue source, leaving them saddled with inventory. That ties up thousands of dollars in Amazon accounts until the issues get resolved, they say. So many are reducing their reliance on Amazon by placing some merchandise on other sites, including eBay, one of Amazon's chief rivals. The tension between Amazon and its sellers was on full display at the Seattle conference, which attracted 100-plus merchants and vendors. The suspension process has given rise to a cottage industry of lawyers, former Amazon seller account investigators and veteran online merchants who charge up to $3,000 to help sellers navigate the mysterious suspension appeal process. Consultant Lesley Hensell was scheduled to lead an afternoon session on "hot button suspensions." She and her partner noticed the business of helping sellers deal with Amazon suspensions pick up a year ago, and they have a 30-person team working on it. "Amazon is getting harder and harder to persuade," she says. "There's no consistency. It's all by email with different people handling the case. This isn't how business partners are supposed to act."

VIDEOS TOP JOBS "I wasn't doing anything shady," says Ayers, who estimates he'll sell $500,000 worth of goods on Amazon this year. "It seems there are a lot of Amazon sellers who aren't doing anything wrong and are getting punished. There's an arbitrary nature to it." He has plenty of company.

If a seller needs to contact us, we have Seller Support associates available hours a day worldwide, including support for urgent issues with a response in an hour or less. Sellers have available to them at any time many comprehensive tools and services to reach and interact with our Seller Support team." But Ayers and other sellers maintain Amazon is too quick to suspend its business partners and too slow to review their appeals, cutting off their primary revenue source, leaving them saddled with inventory. That ties up thousands of dollars in Amazon accounts until the issues get resolved, they say. As a result, many are reducing their reliance on Amazon by placing some of their merchandise on other sites, including EBay Inc., one of Amazon's chief rivals. "Any complaint from any buyer or manufacturer can result in a seller suspension, and their livelihood stops," says CJ Rosenbaum, a New York attorney who says he's helped hundreds of sellers navigate the suspension appeal process in the past several months. "Mom-and-pop businesses can't make the mortgage and big businesses can't make payroll." Sellers say the suspension process is guilty-until-proven-innocent, forcing them to prove complaints are unwarranted or pledging to make improvements to get selling privileges reinstated. They also say that the e-mail appeal process wastes time and energy, and they often field the same request, often vague, seeking additional information without specifying what's wanted. The tension between Amazon and its sellers was on full display at the Seattle conference, which attracted 100-plus merchants and vendors. The suspension process has given rise to a cottage industry of lawyers, former Amazon seller account investigators and veteran online merchants who charge up to $3,000 to help sellers navigate the mysterious suspension appeal process. Consultant Lesley Hensell was scheduled to lead an afternoon session on "hot button suspensions." She and her partner noticed the business of helping sellers deal with Amazon suspensions pick up a year ago, and they now have a 30-person team working on it. "Amazon is getting harder and harder to persuade," she says. "There's no consistency. It's all by email with different people handling the case. This isn't how business partners are supposed to act. If I'm your business partner and you're unhappy with me, I'd hope I could speak with you about it." Amazon is clear in its seller policies that its rules can change at any time, taking effect immediately. Sellers are informed about changes via e-mail and other notifications sent on the platforms they use to manage their accounts. Amazon's view of the perfect customer experience is one that is completely automated with no person-to-person interaction. Someone orders something online, and it arrives on their doorstep. Any additional interaction -- a complaint or a return -- is considered friction that indicates a problem. Sellers maintain this policy is unrealistic and fails to recognize that some shoppers lodge unwarranted complaints to get refunds when they are simply having buyers' remorse. EBay has grappled with similar complaints from its marketplace sellers and last year relaxed its rules in an effort to make amends. Consultants for online merchants encourage sellers to get inventory on EBay and other platforms so their business isn't crippled by an Amazon suspension. That's what happened to Emad Abukheit, who spent several years building a $2 million business selling mostly health and beauty products on Amazon before his account was suspended in March. Customers complained that products they purchased were expired, damaged or not as advertised. He submitted a plan of action to improve operations in his North Carolina warehouse, but Amazon kept requesting additional information and saying his account remained under review without making a decision. He hired Chris McCabe, who once investigated sellers for Amazon and now runs a business helping sellers get reinstated. Frustrated with the lack of response from Amazon beyond generic e-mails telling him his account was under review, Abukheit filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau in April. About two weeks later, he received an email from Amazon that his account would not be reinstated. » Next page...

Tampa Bay Times: Subscribe Make Payment/Renew Missed Paper Vacation Stop E-Paper TBO: Advertise Contact Us AUTOS HOMES JOBS Friday, Jan 06, 2017 76° Home Local News US & World Sports Entertainment Radar Weather Celebrity Throwback Thursday: Local millennials remember Tampa’s ‘David D TV’ By Christopher Spata | TBO.com Published: August 25, 2016 Updated: August 25, 2016 at 11:07 AM David Dodd Throwback Thursday: Local millennials remember Tampa’s ‘David D TV’ Local millennials remember David D TV as that show that aired on WFTS-TV* after Captain Planet and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the ‘90s. It followed a guy with a perfect surfer cut and a single earring, David D, and his mildly mischievous Muppet-looking friend, Smedley. It would have completely faded into the past if not for someone quietly posting several episodes online a few years ago. They went mostly unnoticed until a recent Reddit post about David D TV started getting attention from people excited to find the old episodes available online. “I’ve been trying to figure out this show’s name for years,” wrote user DanglesWangles on the Reddit post. “I only remember it because they went to a Walmart that was right next to my house growing up.” Those YouTube videos reveal a show that’s profoundly weird, Tampa-centric and maybe the most 1990s thing ever. It’s also strangely watchable, with a subtle humor and a world where nobody questions a guy whose roommate is a puppet. “Most shows with puppets, like Sesame Street, they bring the humans into the puppet world. We did the opposite,” said David Dodd, who played David D. Dodd enjoyed a local celebrity status during that run, making public appearances at events like Bucs Fan Fest and marching band competitions. “I remember doing an appearance at Petland where there was a line of hundreds of people wrapped around the building,” said Dodd, now 50. “Whenever I’m in Tampa and I’m doing something around people who are 10 or 20 years younger than I am … I’ll be in line for a beer and some guy will go, ‘Hey! You’re the guy with the puppet.’ “ The show started as part of the Fox Kids Club in 1992 as public service-oriented bumpers between cartoons. When the station changed network affiliations in 1994, David D TV was turned into a half-hour series for Saturday mornings and ran until around 2000. “I remember it as the essence of Florida in the ‘90s,” said filmmaker Thomas Nudi, 27, who grew up watching the show in Bradenton. “It’s full of orange and pink neon, and everyone had Flock of Seagulls haircuts. Seeing it again brought back all the feels. I grew up in a generation that was the fade out of local stations doing narrative TV. Nothing like that show exists now or ever will again. It’s a piece of local history.” David and Smedley’s adventures usually took place around Tampa, St. Petersburg and Clearwater because actual sets would have cost more than the show’s “shoestring” budget allowed. They crash a David Hasselhoff fan convention at Tradewinds Resort in the episode “Vacation Nightmare.” In “Movie Flakes,” they eat cereal in their pajamas inside St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport, though it’s unclear why. Busch Gardens stands in for ancient Egypt in “Mummies From Mars,” though a sign in the background reading “restrooms” kills the illusion. “Stuck at the Mall” takes place entirely in the Tyrone Square Mall parking lot, where Dave and Smedley become trapped when their shoes stick to discarded chewing gum. Dodd, whose on-air name is David Jones, has spent the last 21 years hosting what’s billed as one of the nation’s longest-running morning radio shows, The Jones and Crane Show, on Sarasota’s WSRZ-FM 107.9. Locals are more likely to recognize him from his commercial and infomercial work, specifically the ubiquitous Sunsetter Retractable Awnings commercials that run every summer in the area. He credits David D TV, though, for giving him a start in television. “It was a crash course. Like going to college,” he said. “When it went away, the station manager said, ‘The sales team sells news now,’ and this just isn’t making money. We were heartbroken.” Todd Coyle, a St. Petersburg native who provided the voice and puppeteering for Smedley, now runs a costume business outside of Los Angeles. That career path sprang from his work on David D TV, where he created the Xena: Warrior Princess costumes that David and Smedley wear at Al Lopez Park in the episode “Xenaphobia.” “It was like $50 per show. If we needed an extra character, we’d just get our friends to be in it, or ask someone off the street,” Coyle said. “We’d write the shows ourselves, make the props ourselves. We did a whole episode in a mall parking lot. I don’t know if you’d call that stupid, or creative or desperate.” Even now, he struggles to explain the show’s premise. “There’s a guy and a puppet and they live in a house. We had nothing more concrete than that. Once in awhile we’d think, ‘Who are these people and why are they living in this house?’ and we couldn’t explain it, so we just went with it.” “It was so much fun to hear the recognition when you told people what you did,” he said. “When it’s over, you miss it. I’m not saying it’s the same exactly, but it gives you a little insight into how a famous actor feels when his career is over and nobody knows who he is anymore.” Coyle said he still has one of the Smedley puppets in a box in the attic, though he’s scared to look at it for fear it has probably disintegrated.

Mother thrashes, tries to strangle infant son Andhra Pradesh grapples to fulfil job promiseKrishna Prasad The AP government has been struggling to fulfil its ambitious poll promise of ‘one job per family’ despite roping in major multi-national companies. | TNN | Aug 27, 2016, 08.13 AM IST Representative image HYDERABAD: The AP government has been struggling to fulfil its ambitious poll promise of 'one job per family' despite roping in major multi-national companies. After two-and-a-half years in the government, TDP could provide not more than 50,000 jobs as against the pre-poll promise of creating 10 lakh jobs in the manufacturing sector. Some of the major investments received in the last two years include Walmart, Dalas, Sun Edition, Ashok Leyland, Bharat Forge, Essel Group, Suzlon Energy and Linde Group. However, they have not yet started their operations in the state. The AP government had set a target of developing 5,000 startups and 100 technology incubators by 2019. Introduction of the new industrial policy to bring down the approval time for business to an average of 14 days in 2016-17, compared to an average of 21days in 2015-16, had succeeded in attracting foreign direct investment into the state. The government could convince 41international companies and 328 Indian companies to make an investment of about Rs 4,800 crore in AP. But, only US-based Mondelez International (Cadbury) opened its manufacturing unit in Chittoor district. "Many of these units are still bargaining for more incentives and free infrastructure. Some of them are even threatening to move to other states. These issues will be resolved at a higher level," said a senior official in the investment and infrastructure department. The companies, which entered into MoUs with the state government, are still finding it difficult to get the necessary infrastructure, including power, water and road connectivity. There are several complaints over lack of cooperation at the ground level resulting in the delay. Thinking that tourism will be the next big thing, the AP government also entered into agreements with 16 companies that agreed to invest Rs 4,000 crore. It also released the new tourism policy, which projected creation of 50,000 jobs every year. But in reality, none of the projects has started. In the last 26 months, only 2,000 jobs have been created in the tourism sector. The state government also launched a Skill Development Corporation to train local talent in various skills. As many as 90,000 people were imparted 'employability' skills. Interestingly, most of them refused the offers saying that the salary offered was meagre. Only 20,000 people took up jobs in the construction sector. AP ranks 10 in the list of unemployment rate in the country. About 30 per cent of people in the state do not have jobs in urban areas. The TDP stormed to power in the May 2014 elections after it promised jobs to all unemployed in the state. It had also promised unemployment allowance.

News Week In Review: 'Strengthened' Yellen, Mylan EpiPen Furor, Best Buy Hot, Dollar Stores Pinched Mylan CEO Heather Bresch came under heavy fire for the drugmaker's big EpiPen price hikes. (AP) IBD STAFF 8/26/2016 Reprints Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said the case for a rate hike is stronger now, but investors weren't sure what to make of that. Pfizer (PFE) paid $14 billion for a one-drug biotech, but shares of drugs and pharma supply chain companies sold off as Mylan's (MYL) EpiPen price hikes drew outrage. Best Buy (BBY) earnings surprised investors, while dollar stores came under pressure. Stocks Retreat, Sideways Trade Continues For the week, the Nasdaq fell 0.4%, the S&P 500 0.7% and the Dow 0.8%. The major averages are still in sideways action. Drug stocks were big movers on Pfizer's Medivation (MDVN) deal and Mylan's EpiPen furor. Dollar stores suffered heavy losses as competition from Wal-Mart (WMT) was heating up. Yellen: Rate Hike Case 'Strengthened' Fed Chair Janet Yellen said at Friday's long-awaited speech that the case for an interest rate hike has "strengthened in recent months." That followed other modestly hawkish statements from fellow Fed policymakers. However, Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said Yellen's comments were consistent with a September rate increase. He saw the possibility of two rate hikes this year. Markets had already priced a Fed move, perhaps in December, but they don't expect any quick follow-up House (Data) Divided New-home sales soared to a 654,000 annual rate in July, by far the highest since October 2007, the Commerce Department reported. The 12% rise from June surprised economists looking for a slight dip to 580,000. Luxury homebuilder Toll Bros. (TOL) confirmed that the high end of the market is prospering, reporting a 69% jump in third-quarter earnings per share, a 23.5% rise in revenue and a strong backlog of orders. Existing-home sales fell more than expected in July, though that was from June's cycle high. But applications for loans to buy a home fell to a six-month low. Toll shares soared to a seven-month high, moving above their 200-day moving average. Durable goods orders jumped 4.4% in July, or 1.5% excluding transportation, with both results better than expected. Core capital goods orders rose 1.5% after a small June gain, the first back-to-back increase for the business investment proxy since January 2015. Mylan's Epic-Pen Failure The generic drugmaker Mylan sold off 11.55% for the week as members of the Senate and other politicians started inquiring into its price increases on its emergency allergy drug/device EpiPen. That fueled selling in drug and biotech stocks. Mylan CEO Heather Bresch, daughter of Sen. Joe Machin, D-W.V., said only a fraction of the $608 list price makes it back to Mylan, due to all the middlemen, leading shares of Express Scripts (ESRX), CVS Health (CVS) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) to fall as well. Pfizer Buys Medivation, Antibiotics Big pharma Pfizer agreed to buy Medivation for $14 billion in cash, snatching the cancer-drug specialist from Sanofi (SNY), which had been trying for months to acquire Medivation. Biotechs rallied Monday on the news, with BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) jumping on rumors that it was Sanofi's second choice of target. On Wednesday, Pfizer agreed to buy the antibiotics business of AstraZeneca (AZN) for $725 million plus possible future milestone and sales payments and royalties that could amount to $850 million. Oil Settles In Oil prices may be settling into a trading range in the mid to high $40 range. OPEC members gave conflicting signals over whether they might support a production freeze, while Goldman Sachs said such a move would not "be sufficient to support prices much further." Meanwhile, the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude inventories rose by 2.5 million barrels vs. expectations for a small drop. Domestic production fell slightly. Mobileye The road to self-driving cars got a little more crowded as Mobileye (MBLY) announced it will partner with General Motors (GM) supplier Delphi Automotive (DLPH) to jointly develop off-the-shelf autonomous driving technology for automakers. The two companies will co-develop "the market's first turnkey Level 4/5 automated driving solution." Mobileye already has deal with BMW (BMWYY) and Intel (INTC) to bring an autonomous vehicle to market by 2021. Mobileye shares spiked Tuesday on the Delphi news, briefly topping a buy point. Shares rose 2.3% for the week. Tesla Motors (TSLA), which is ending its business relationship with Mobileye, introduced new versions of its Model S and X that boosts speeds and driving range, powered by an updated battery technology. Tesla said its upgraded Model S is now the fastest-accelerating car in commercial production. Tesla shares fell 2.2%, closing below the 50-day line and just above the 200-day line. Tesla partner Nvidia (NVDA) unveiled a new processor for autonomous driving, saying it's 50%-100% more powerful than other mobile processors. Ulta Beauty Guidance Flawed The beauty products retailer reported better-than-expected earnings and sales, with yet another quarter of double-digit same-stores growth. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) also raised full-year EPS guidance. But its Q3 profit range was a little cautious. Ulta shares have been on a strong run-up, so it may have been priced for perfection. Ulta shares tumbled 6% on Friday, undercutting its 50-day moving average. Workday Workday (WDAY) reported a wider-than-expected Q2 adjusted loss. But it topped on some key metrics, including revenue, which rose 34% to $377.7 million. But shares of the cloud-based human resources software maker rose 2.5%, hitting a 2016 high on Thursday. Talend July IPO Talend (TLND) lost an adjusted $1.84 a share, according to its late Thursday release, but the French Big Data firm later clarified that the bottom line actually met estimates for a loss of 31 cents a share after adjusting for the share count following its initial offering. Revenue rose 38% to $25.4 million, just beating. Talend sees Q3 losses in line with views, but it guided revenue slightly higher. Shares fell 4% after much bigger intraday losses. Best Buy, GameStop Divide Investors Best Buy (BBY) stock jumped 21% for the week to a 17-month high on better-than-expected sales and earnings for its fiscal second quarter, including a surprise increase in same-store sales. The consumer electronics retailer credited rising demand for wearable technology, appliances and home-theater systems for the increase. Video game and electronics retailer GameStop (GME) disappointed investors with in-line EPS and below-forecast sales. Dollar Stores Are Discounted Discount retailers Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) suffered double-digit share price losses, as both reported second-quarter results that came up short of Wall Street expectations, with falling grocery prices and tougher competition hurting sales. Those results came as Wal-Mart is waging its own campaign to cut prices, a move that could draw more customers who have become more cautious with their spending. Jewelers Mixed Meanwhile, the jeweler Tiffany (TIF) held to its full-year outlook, while its Q2 EPS beat views, helping to boost shares. However, Signet Jewelers (SIG), the parent of mall jewelers Kay, Jared and Zales, slashed its fiscal-year outlook, partly due to difficulties "in the energy-dependent regions." Those regions' economies have been hurt by cheap oil and other commodities. HP Beats, But Guidance Weak HP Inc. (HPQ) reported that its fiscal Q3 earnings per share minus one-time items jumped 37% in fiscal Q3 to 48 cents on a 4% decline in sales to $11.89 billion, both better than views. For the current quarter, the printer and PC maker sees non-GAAP EPS of 34-37 cents, vs. consensus for 41 cents. HP is reducing its printing supplies inventory and is deeply discounting printers to expand its installed base. Shares closed little changed after a brief Thursday morning sell-off.

Home Sports News Business Opinion A&E Blogs Life Weather Photos Videos Homes Jobs × NewsOK Log In Close LIVE LIVE: Slick roads, cold temps across state Mexico official stops off in Miami to ‘set the record straight’ about country’s relationship with US By Patricia Mazzei, Associated Press Published: August 26, 2016 7:46 PM CDT Updated: August 26, 2016 7:50 PM CDT 0 shares facebook twitter pinterest email comments Advertisement MIAMI — What may be the most extraordinary public-relations campaign of this year’s extraordinary presidential election made a stop Friday in an unexpected place: Miami’s luxe Mandarin Oriental hotel. Past the $21 car valet, through the incense-scented lobby, at the head of a well-appointed conference-room table, sat the tourism minister of Mexico. His mission: to counter the rhetoric of Republican nominee Donald Trump. Or, as Minister Enrique de la Madrid put it: “To set the record straight.” The record between the U.S. and Mexico, as de la Madrid sees it, is one of shared prosperity and of ties so tight that both countries — not just Mexico — would lose if politics managed to tear them apart. “Six million jobs in the U.S. are dependent on the trade with Mexico. Twenty-eight states of the 50 states in the United States have Mexico as a No. 1 or No. 2 most relevant trading partner,” he said. “Mexico is a very important market for many investments of U.S. companies —firms like Wal-Mart, firms like Citigroup, firms like American Airlines, that are doing very good business because they are selling goods and services into Mexico.” If the U.S. were to halt trade or raise tariffs, de la Madrid warned, its leaders should “ask Americans if they want to pay higher prices for their cars, higher prices for their clothes, higher prices for their food.” “That’s the reality, and the whole story must be told,” he said. “That’s what we feel is our obligation — because, of course, it affects us, but it would also affect you.” He was more than comfortable rattling off the numbers. But what de la Madrid didn’t want to do was tackle Trump’s positions. He maintained he didn’t want to talk about Trump at all — though publicists who scheduled his local media interviews specifically pitched an anti-Trump message. “We’re not against anyone. We’re just against bad ideas,” de la Madrid insisted. “I’m not here to discuss Mr. Trump.” Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, he added, is also “not very much in favor of trade.” Yet there was no getting away from the fact that Trump — who called some Mexican immigrants “rapists,” who proposes building a “big, beautiful” border wall that Mexico would pay for, who prompted former Mexican President Vicente Fox to call Trump “crazy” and later apologize — has led the alarmed government of a neighboring foreign country to take unusual action. “It is becoming more usual,” de la Madrid said — adding that the government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto learned, “because of the American campaign, that probably the image of Mexico was not at its best.” Trump’s hard-line promises of building the wall and creating a “deportation force” to round up people who are in the U.S. illegally helped him win the GOP primary. Faced with a far more diverse group of general-election voters, Trump has spent the past few days waffling on his position, saying he was open to “softening” it. He told Fox News on Tuesday he might give some undocumented immigrants legal status if they paid “back taxes” — the sort of stance shared by ex-rivals Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. By Friday, Trump told CNN there would be no legalization. De la Madrid delved into none of that, touching only on the wall. “The one who wants to build it should pay for it,” he said. “Americans should be more worried about building better schools. They should be more worried about building better infrastructure. They should be more worried about building better housing. The last thing they need to be worried about is building new walls.” Over the past few months, de la Madrid — the son of former Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid — said he’s visited New York, San Diego and Phoenix, and Cleveland and Philadelphia, the cities that hosted the presidential conventions. In Miami, he planned to meet city Mayor Tomas Regalado and the Doral City Council. He had already spoken to Bush’s son, Jeb Bush Jr. On Thursday, the elder Bush told a New York radio station that Trump’s immigration-policy shift was “abhorrent.” De la Madrid said he feels “challenged” by the U.S. campaign — and is happy to react by offering “information.” Could his PR campaign put the relationship with a future President Donald Trump at risk? Said de la Madrid: “I hope not.” ——— ©2016 Miami Herald Visit Miami Herald at www.miamiherald.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. _____ Topics: g000362665,g000221937,g000362669,g000226000,g000362695,g000220155,g000065577,g000220201,g000362661,g000066164 Subscribe to NewsOK's Breaking News We will send you breaking news notifications as news happens, locally or wherever.

Dykes and Barbara Eisenhardt said they were surprised when they found out the site plan included an entrance and exit on Wild Wing Boulevard. “Wild Wing Boulevard is very heavily traveled with people going to the golf course and all of the neighborhoods and developments in the Wild Wing area,” Eisenhardt said. “I think it not only creates congestion, but also dangers as people are trying to hurry to cross the road or make the light and somebody is trying to get into the ALDI,” Dykes said. “It’s just ripe for accidents I believe.” Conway Planning Director Adam Emrick said the planning commission’s goal is to minimize conflict when planning ingress and egress. He said a Wild Wing Boulevard entrance will be safer than having an entrance on U.S. 501 because that would be too close to the traffic light. He said a 2007 South Carolina Department of Transportation traffic study for the feasibility of the traffic light at Wild Wing Boulevard and U.S. 501 allows for an entrance and exit on Wild Wing Boulevard for whatever commercial development would go into the land on that corner. Dykes got a copy of the study and he said he think it is outdated. “It was before Walmart was built,” he said. “It was before all of the expansion that has occurred at Coastal Carolina and Horry Georgetown Tech.” However, Emrick said the study accounted for the full development of Wild Wing, which he said is only at about 50 percent completion right now. He added there is no need to do another study now or change the design because it accommodates all of that residential development along with development of all four corners of commercial properties. Dykes said he thinks safety is at risk with the use of a 2007 study in 2016. “I think it is inappropriate,” he said. “I think it is a bad decision. I think it represents bad planning. I think the city needs to change their mind on this and go back and re-evaluate it.” Now, Dykes and Eisenhardt are working together to get more people to ask the city to rethink the plan. However, Eisenhardt said she thinks they were not properly notified of how to express their opinions throughout the planning process. She said she was never notified of the public hearing for the ordinance involving annexation and rezoning of the property on the Conway City Council agenda in July. Eisenhardt also said she found out the proposed ALDI for that same site would be on a Conway Board of Zoning Appeals agenda from a friend who has property closer to it. “It felt to me like they were trying to somehow circumvent the notice that we would liked to have had for all the neighborhoods here so that we could participate in the decision making for our own community,” she said. Emrick said only properties within 200 feet receive notice by mail. He said a sign was posted about the public hearing in July on the ALDI site along U.S. 501 and another has been posted for the Board of Zoning Appeals meeting, which was rescheduled from Thursday to Sept. 15 at 5:30 p.m., at city hall. He said the opportunity for public comment passed with the zoning. Emrick said the entrance and exit is not approved yet and that the technical review committee has been going back and forth with the developer to finalize the plan. However, he said he does not expect it to change because it has been planned this way since the SCDOT traffic study and he does not know where else it could logically go. “It was very disappointing that they were saying it’s a done deal,” Eisenhardt said. Emrick said the board of zoning appeals will not be discussing the entrance and exit at its meeting because he said the request is in regard to adding parking spaces. Eisenhardt said she thinks the parking spaces should be used as a bargaining tool to get the developer to change the entrance and exit location, but Emrick said that is not possible.

Discount retailer Dollar General said Thursday that it's cutting prices on hundreds of items across 2,000 stores. The strategy follows a similar path set forth by other chains such as Wal-Mart, Kroger and Trader Joe's. Cutting costs to get people in the door is a time-tested strategy, but it could mean slimmer margins for both grocery stores and suppliers. As it turns out, that could be a risky move. “Because you will not out-Wal-Mart Wal-Mart,” supermarket analyst David Livingston said. In fact, Wal-Mart recently announced its own plan to slash prices even more on high-traffic items, such as fresh fruit and laundry detergent. Ten billion dollars in cash reserves can buy you that luxury.  Follow Adam Allington at @@aallington.  Adam Allington Adam Allington is an reporter covering economics and policy in the Washington D.C. bureau.

Fleck as coach How one company eliminated food waste by renaming it Target may seek rival bedding supplier Retailer has begun sampling sheets made by Trident Video Photo Employees work at a Target store at St. Albert, Alberta, January 15, 2015. REUTERS/Dan Riedlhuber/Files Bloomberg Aug 26, 2016 at 5:23 pm | Print View Target is considering shifting some orders to Trident after it terminated $90 million of business with rival supplier Welspun India for labeling cheaper bedsheets as premium Egyptian cotton, according to people familiar with the discussions. The U.S. retail giant has begun sampling sheets manufactured by Trident, according to the people, who asked not to be identified as the talks are confidential. Trident, based in the northern state of Punjab, supplies terry towels to Target and is one of the few Indian companies with the capacity to produce more bedsheets, they said. “We have previously shared that we were actively working with existing vendors on our matrix to determine where we move the business. Trident is one of our current vendors,” said Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder. “It would be premature to speculate on how we will plan for, and distribute our business.” A Trident representative declined to comment. Target on Aug. 19 severed business ties with Welspun, India’s largest home textiles exporter after discovering that sheets and pillows labeled as premium Egyptian cotton were actually made with another type of cotton. The retailer pulled the items from its stores and offered customers refunds. Other Welspun clients, including Wal-Mart Stores, Bed Bath & Beyond and J.C. Penney, said they are reviewing Welspun’s product claims and certification records. Trident plans to make a big push into bed and bath linens and estimates they will comprise about 80 percent of its textiles revenue in two years, according to its most recent annual report. The company shares many of Welspun’s customers, including including Target, Wal-Mart, J.C. Penney and Macy’s, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “There is a good chance that Trident may step into Welspun’s shoes,” said Arun Kejriwal, a director at Kejriwal Research & Investment in Mumbai. “This is even more so as new capacity set up by Trident is yet to be fully utilized. They can ramp up quickly.” Your next Business articles Oil prices rise as Saudi Arabia discusse ... Sears to close three Iowa Kmart stores; ... Peyton Sporting Goods grows faster than ...

Asa Hutchison, state agencies including the Arkansas Economic Development Commission and the Arkansas Department of Workforce Services, the Delta Regional Authority, Wal-Mart and others, recently announced the launch of a statewide workforce to achieve the initiative. A key component of this initiative is a touring Be Pro Workshop which will encourage student participation in construction, trucking, manufacturing and other specific roles. The workshop includes interactive work stations that engage students in several skilled professional careers through gaming, rich video and more. Arkansas’ skilled professional workforce is aging fast, leading to a growing gap in finding Arkansans to fill these positions. There are an estimated 5.8 million job openings in the U.S. today. Approximately 60,000 of these openings exist in Arkansas with the majority being in highly skilled technical fields. This gap in our state’s employment can be directly attributed to a lack of knowledge, interest and preparation for these opportunities among younger generations. Arkansas’ future will depend on changing the perception of these career options and highlighting the many opportunities available within these sectors. Only one in three parents say they would encourage their children to pursue technical careers, despite the advanced skills and high pay characteristic of the existing opportunities within these industries. Offering Arkansans new insight into the skilled professional workforce requires a team approach that includes employers, schools, elected officials, students and parents who recognize skilled professions for the financial and rewarding career opportunities they are. Be Pro Be Proud is free and open to the public.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Sears Canada Inc., the once mighty retail giant, announced it was rebranding Wednesday with a “clean and contemporary logo.” The new look, which evenly spaces the five obvious letters, S-E-A-R-S, before a punctuating red stencil of a maple leaf is, at first glance, perhaps a bit nondescript. “The new Sears (Canada) logo: because being boring is better than being ugly.” That tagline was offered up by Strategy magazine marketing reporter Josh Kolm in a tweet. But the simple look might be the point, says marketing expert Alan Middleton. Sears Canada’s straightforward approach with this rebrand, a major departure from its iconic blue lettering halved by thin white stripes, may well be the best fit for its effort to reinvent itself with a more diversified online business and smaller physical footprint. Related Sears Canada loses another top executive: Carrie Kirkman out less than a year after joining company Sears Canada says it will cut more costs as it posts bigger loss “I will give Sears Canada 10/10 for the reinvention effort they are putting in,” said Middleton, a professor at York University’s Schulich School of Business. “They’re coming from a long way behind with ever strong competition from The Bay, Walmart and most importantly the omni-retailers like Amazon and Alibaba.” Middleton said the new design aligns the brand with the most important thing for Sears Canada’s current strategic objectives: its stated desire to grab a sizeable foothold in online commerce, reduce its dependency on physical stores and buttress its credibility as a streamlined business. Noting the “bold, confident new logo,” he stressed that the success of the visual break from the past will be determined by these bigger and more complicated factors. “What will be the key will be how good their online customer experience is, not just directly but through their catalogues: awareness, the e-journey and the pricing,” Middleton said. Adding that there is an abundance of marketing activity at this important back-to-school time, Middleton said Sears Canada’s success will also hinge on how quickly they can afford to expand their new store concepts — which the company has dubbed Sears 2.0 — and associate their planned new layout and customer service models with the new branding. This will be the fourth major logo the company has had since its founding in 1953. It’s had variations of the current and best known blue and white version since 1984, which it took on when it formally changed its name to Sears Canada Inc. The most significant change since was the addition of a small maple leaf in 1996 to distinguish the company from its American counterpart. Originally named Simpsons-Sears after its two founding parents in 1953, it changed its logo in 1973 to drop Simpsons in order to avoid confusion with existing Simpsons stores. Sears Canada has been ailing with declines in traffic at its physical stores and has struggled to establish an online shopping experience on par with competitors. “We are proud to unveil this symbol of reinvention for Sears Canada,” said Brandon Stranzl, Sears Canada executive chairman,in a release. “Sears is changing, and our new logo asserts the modern and streamlined image and consumer experience for which we are striving in-store and online.” In June, the company reported that in the first quarter of 2016 its loss climbed to $63.6 million or 62 cents a share from a loss of $59.1-million or 58 cents a year earlier. Sears Canada’s overall revenue fell to $596 million from $697 million. Same-store sales at the Toronto-based retailers “core” outlets — 95 department stores and 39 home stores — were down 6.9 per cent and overall same-store sales fell 7.4 per cent. Sears Canada also said it had raised its cost-cutting target in an attempt to return to profitability, aiming to lower annual costs by as much as $155 million. Last year, the company slashed costs by $125 million, and more cuts will likely mean store closings and layoffs.

Roston - Aug 26, 2016 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Domino’s introduced a pizza delivery drone in the summer of 2013, and now it is going to start testing actual pizza-by-drone deliveries soon. The testing will take place in New Zealand, and is being done in partnership with drone company Flirtey. The company isn’t offering too many details about its plan at this time, though it does say it will kick off the testing later this year and that it’ll happen alongside ordinary (read: people-powered) pizza deliveries. The idea of pizza drone deliveries spawned around the time Amazon made the idea of anything-drone deliveries public. Though we’re still a long way off from seeing any substantial number of drone-based deliveries, companies have been actively testing such systems, including Walmart and more, and Domino’s is no exception. Many companies have been forced to look outside of the U.S. for its testing, though, due to difficult regulations in the nation. New Zealand recently instituted new UAV/drone regulations that allow companies such as Domino’s to carry out these tests. Assuming Domino’s likes what it sees with this test, it will be carrying out similar tests in half a dozen other places, including the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, France, Japan, and Australia. As far as the New Zealand test goes, Domino’s will have limitations on what items can be delivered via drone, including things like how much the order weighs and where the customer is located. However, it could expand the number of items available by drone in the future. The company has indicated that drone deliveries are more sensible than vehicular deliveries for many orders — if you’re just getting a small pizza, for example, having someone hop in an SUV to drive it over seems pretty wasteful.

(WDRB) - A group of local business leaders met at the Muhammad Ali Center on Friday to talk about the economic future of west Louisville. After the FoodPort deal was canceled and projects like the YMCA and Walmart were put on hold, some neighbors in west Louisville are left wondering what's next. “There are a lot of issues in west Louisville, [like] being able to have a living wage, being able to support your family, to have decent, or more than decent, educational opportunities for all the residents of west Louisville," said Ramona Lindsey with the West Louisville Community Council. "That's all important." Local business and government leaders are putting their heads together to come up with solutions like increasing home ownership rates, particularly in the Russell neighborhood. Twenty-four market rate homes are planned to be built on Cedar Street. Also, they want to make it easier for people to open businesses in West Louisville. One local business owner, Demetrious Gray, knows what that's like. Gray started a roofing business five years ago that makes more than $1 million in sales each year. He says he would like to see it become easier for entrepreneurs with big ideas to get financial help, not just micro-businesses. “If you wanted to be small, you could go find some dollars,” Grays said. “But to do something large was much harder, so I would love to see this community of people decide that ‘hey, we are going to really make it advantageous for young entrepreneurs to do big things in the city.’” U.S. Representative Emanuel Cleaver, who helped turn around the economy in Kansas City, Mo., was a speaker at the event. Kansas City used jazz and baseball to bring jobs to the area. “You have a couple of things that are similar,” Rep. Cleaver said. “You have, after all, a very famous African American who came from here. Although it's already been exploited some, I think you can exploit the Muhammad Ali legacy.” Members of the West Louisville Community Council say they can't create more jobs without feedback from people who actually live in west Louisville. The West Louisville Community Council is holding a meeting on Monday, Aug. 29 from 6:30-7 p.m. at the Louisville Urban League. Anyone with questions or concerns is invited to attend.  Copyright 2016 by WDRB News. All rights reserved.

The kids from the “Greener Fields” 4-H Club brought their collection to the Middlefield Walmart earlier this month, and it was a big success. Dr. Augustine Kellis of Kellis Eye Center in Chardon will match donations up to $20,000. So far, the club has collected over $8,000. One of the youngest members, Margo, raised $118 with a lemonade stand, and she even stocks the shelves at the Burton Food Pantry. The kids also sold raffle tickets for the Notre Dame-Cathedral Latin football pep rally, where school officials and the football coach volunteered to get hit with a pie in the face!

Photo Courtesy University of Mississippi Medical Center By Onelia Hawa Friday, August 26, 2016 1:27 p.m. CDT Upvote 0 JACKSON  Despite ongoing controversy over his role in Hinds County criminal case, Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood is bragging this week after several local court wins, including sending a Jackson man to prison for "depraved heart murder." Dennis Pickett Photo courtesy AG A press statement yesterday from Hood's office announced that Hinds County Circuit Judge William Gowan has sentenced Dennis Pickett, 21, to 20 years in prison, which he must serve day-to-day. Picket pled guilty to killing Destinee Ford, a 15-year-old freshman, outside a Jackson high school on the afternoon of Dec. 5, 2013, after classes had been dismissed for the day. Ford was shot during a fight between students; Pickett was charged along with two other defendants. "Our thoughts and prayers remain with the victim's family, and we cannot understate our appreciation to the Jackson Police Department for their persistence and hard work and for making this arrest," Hood said in the statement. "We thank Judge Gowan for the solid sentence bringing this defendant to justice for this senseless murder." The statement gave credit for the arrest to Hood's investigators Perry Tate and Miller Faulk and the Jackson Police Department. Special Assistant Attorneys General Patrick Beasley and Alison O'Neal McMinn handled the prosecution. Hood's office sent a press release today announcing that Jack Kirby Waters, 57, pled guilty Thursday before Hinds County Circuit Court Judge Jeff Weill Sr. to one count of auto theft. Weill sentenced Waters to 10 years in prison with five of those years suspended, leaving five years to serve. Waters misrepresented himself as a wholesale dealer to an employee at Paul Moak Honda in Jackson on Oct. 8, 2014, getting keys to a Honda Accord to test drive it, but didn't bring it back. The perpetrator was convicted of three felonies prior to this crime, including false pretense in 2002, shoplifting in 2013 and auto theft in 2014, all in Hinds County, Hood announced. The Jackson Police Department investigated the case, and the AG's office prosecuted it. Property Crime Down, Rise in Violent Crime The Jackson Police Department's weekly crime report shows that total crime is down overall 22.1 percent and 26.1 year-to-date over 2015. With a recent rise in property crime reported in last week's crime roundup, especially grand larceny-stealing property valued at more than $500 in Precinct 4, JPD happily reports an overall 91.7 percent decline in grand larceny crimes this week over last week Document Comstat Report for August 15 to August 21 Download .PDF While property crime is declining, Precinct 2—consisting of the west Jackson area—and Precinct 4 (northeast Jackson in and near Fondren) have both seen a rise in violent crime activity in the past week, mostly aggravated assaults and armed robberies. On Tuesday morning, Aug. 23, JPD responded to a call at Mary C. Jones School in north Jackson where a black Jaguar struck the school's playground fence and came to a stop, a JPD press release states. Rodney Beck, 50, was found dead after the police identified him with a single gunshot wound to his right arm that also punctured his chest. The press release says the shooting took place at another location where an unidentified witness advised officers that Beck and another unidentified suspect wearing a Cowboys jersey were having a conversation, and the victim fled in his vehicle after being shot. Batson Children's Hospital 'Champion Child' On Tuesday, Aug. 23, JPD collaborated with the Children's Miracle Network Coordinators, Batson Children's Hospital and Walmart for a special "patient transport" for 14-year-old Jordan Morgan, a press release from Commander Tyree Jones states. Walmart trucks transported the "Champion Child" from Batson Children's Hospital to the Clinton Walmart on Highway 80 with a JPD motorcade escort. "From my understanding he wanted to ride in the 18-wheeler and to be sworn in as a police officer," JPD Chief Lee Vance said. "So we came up with a document just for him, and I was able to swear him in as an honorary police officer, and we presented him with a badge." Vance says Morgan got a chance to talk on the police radio and ordered the officers to arrest anyone who got caught participating in bullying. "It was a remarkable experience for us. It was the most fun thing I've done in all my years here," Vance said. "Jordan is a very articulate young man, very smart kid, and it was great to be able to spend some time with him." "Children's Miracle Network has "Champion Children" throughout the United States, so each state has its champion," Annie Oeth, editor of the Division of Public Affairs at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, told the Jackson Free Press. Oeth says a 'Champion Child' is one who has benefitted from pediatric care in a children's Miracle Network hospital. Morgan was born with cerebral palsy, also known as CP, which the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes reports is a "neurological disorder that appears in infancy or early childhood and permanently affects body movement, muscle coordination, and balance. CP affects the part of the brain that controls muscle movements." "His family was told at one time that he wouldn't walk," Oeth says. "He walks, he runs and roller skates. He plays he piano, enjoys cooking and is a very multifaceted teenager." Email news tips to news@jacksonfreepress.com.

After being alerted about the website by a customer who never received their puppy, BBB initiated an investigation of www.tinyyorkiepupshome.com. After BBB attempted to contact the “company,” the website was taken down. Just a week later, a new website, www.magnusteacupyorkies.net took its place. Now this website has also been taken down. BBB believes this scam operation will appear again soon with yet another new name. BBB found multiple red flags during the investigation: Suspiciously low prices. The website claims “T-CUP YORKIES PUPPIES FOR SALE AT 50%.” One victim told BBB they sent $578 for a puppy. This breed can typically sell for up to $800 without papers, and $1,500 with AKC papers. Money wire. The company requires payment through Walmart-to-Walmart wire transfer. The pictures of the puppies for sale were pulled from other websites. The company does not list any contact information. One victim was told by the “company” that they were located at a Blacksburg address, but the address is a private residence not connected to the “company.” According to one victim in Louisiana, the website required payment via a Walmart-to-Walmart money wire. They were told the puppies were at the Blacksburg address, but later discovered their payment was picked up at a Washington, D.C., Walmart. The puppy was never delivered. The owner of the Blacksburg residence being used by the scammers told BBB that one person had knocked on their front door asking about the puppies. Though only one victim has come forward, BBB believes multiple people have been scammed by this fraudulent website. The website mirrors a similar scam first reported by BBB in May 2015. That website, comfortbulldogs.com, used very similar tactics and also listed a Southwest Virginia address. Protect yourself from potential scams online by following these tips: Avoid buying online. Unless you can visit the breeding facility before the purchase and bring your puppy home personally, do not purchase a puppy from a website. When you have a puppy shipped from another area, you don’t know how that puppy has been treated, how healthy or young it is, or whether or not the puppy exists at all. Ask to see the parents. Before bringing a puppy home, ask to see his or her parents and the living area where he or she was born and raised. Honest breeders will be happy to show you around. If the seller refuses or makes excuses, walk away. Ask for references. Ask the breeder for contact information of people who have bought puppies in the past. Try to talk to people who have had their dog a while in order to check for issues that may not be immediately apparent, like genetic problems. Read contracts thoroughly. If the seller offers a health guarantee, make sure it is in writing and read it carefully for limits and proof requirements. Guarantees should cover more than a few weeks or days, since it can take weeks for symptoms to appear in illnesses like parvo and distemper. Genetic issues might not become apparent for years. Ask for medical records. Get a written account of all medical care your puppy has received, including vaccinations and antibiotics. Take this record to your vet during the first examination. See a veterinarian immediately. Within a few days of bringing your puppy home, schedule a complete physical with your vet to make sure it is in good health. Check pedigree. If purchasing a pedigreed pet, be sure the breeder provides documentation of the parents’ registration with the appropriate kennel club. This ensures that the pet is, in fact, a legitimate pure-bred animal. It is then your responsibility to register your pet with the appropriate kennel club. Too good to be true. Watch out for suspiciously low prices. If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is. Check website. Confirm that the website you are purchasing from is a company’s official website. A quick search of the company should be able to tell you if the website you are using is the official webpage, or at least affiliated with the company. Payment concerns. Be cautious of businesses that require payment through wire transfer and MoneyGram only. Wire transactions are almost impossible to reverse/trace and are widely used by scammers.

(View our Privacy Policy) Baseball's minor leaguers pursue their dreams below the poverty line By Kent Babb and Jorge Castillo, The Washington Post KENT BABBJORGE CASTILLOWashington Post Friday, August 26, 2016 2:16pm Print 0 My Edition I want to see more articles tagged I'm already following articles tagged Previous Next Previous Next AUGUSTA, Ga. — They trickled into the mid-July night, a rain-shortened loss beginning their Friday night early. A 25-year-old catcher hung back. Related News/Archive Rays Superfan Jennifer McKenney bidding for USA national women's baseball team 3 Weeks Ago Matt Paré chatted with teammates and underwent a long treatment session as other Augusta GreenJackets players exited through a clubhouse door wedged open with a broken bat. He kept himself awake with a marathon shower. By the time Paré dressed, he had the clubhouse to himself, along with what was left of the GreenJackets' postgame buffet. "What have we got, Sarge?" he called toward clubhouse manager Kristopher Nichols, a former Army drill sergeant who appreciates - and usually rewards — Paré's resourcefulness. Paré is the oldest player for the San Francisco Giants' Class-A affiliate, and he begins most homestands by waiting out his teammates in order to stockpile free food. Far away from Major League Baseball's mighty salaries and Hollywood glitz, Paré is among the thousands of minor leaguers who survive on baseball earnings below the federal poverty line. Baseball has in recent years parlayed renewed popularity into record earnings, leveraging apparel and media demands into $9.5 billion in revenue last year; each of its 30 franchises averaged $23 million in profits in 2015, and many of their minor league affiliates saw attendance figures and team values continue a steady climb. But the overwhelming majority of players in professional baseball's extensive player development system never see a cut of that wealth. More than 80 percent of draft picks will never reach the big leagues, and most live on salaries of less than $10,000 per season; the starting salary for a first-year player, paid only during the regular season, is $1,100. "You always question yourself: Should I be doing this?" said Pare, who says he's making about $7,500 in salary during this 22-week season — a little more than $340 a week, or about $8.50 an hour. Paré shares a two-bedroom apartment with three teammates. He has, in four years as a professional ballplayer, accumulated a mountain of credit card debt. His experience is typical among players on pro baseball's ground floor, highlighting that financial struggle is, as much as promo nights and floodlit nostalgia, a minor league tradition. One that might, according to a lawsuit filed against Major League Baseball two years ago, violate federal and state minimum wage laws. "The organization traces its roots to the nineteenth century," reads the suit, filed in a California district court and led by 41 former players. "Unfortunately for many of its employees, its wage and labor practices remain stuck there." MLB has denied that its organizational structure is unlawful and rather provides opportunity to thousands of young athletes who want to make it to the big leagues. Indeed, many players say the sacrifices are worth it. "In reality I just wanted a chance," said Wilmer Difo, a Dominican-born player who, before being called up by the Washington Nationals last year, spent five seasons in the minor leagues and spent the majority of the 2013 season sleeping on an air mattress in an apartment with five other players. "That's everyone's dream, to get to the major leagues. But it's not always going to be like that. Not everyone. Unfortunately, not everyone, but there are a lot of people that depend on it anyway." Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred indicated to reporters in July that additional regulation could ultimately lead to smaller minor league rosters or fewer teams. The lawsuit has nonetheless turned a spotlight on a shadowy corner of a game in which players routinely put in 60-hour work weeks and must face continual personal and professional obstacles in the name of chasing a dream. Athletes from Latin America are particularly at risk. Many come to the United States from impoverished backgrounds with little or no knowledge of English, and lack both the cultural understanding of life in the country and network of family and friends that can help ease the burden. They are guaranteed a salary, health insurance and not much else. But there are reasons they keep playing: Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw's $33.8 million annual salary is the game's richest, and the average major league player earns $4.4 million per season. When the GreenJackets' season began, their highest salary belonged to Adam Sonabend, an undrafted 24-year-old catcher. His biweekly paycheck, after taxes, is $671. That's enough for Sonabend to have his own bedroom, which is more than his three roommates can say. GreenJackets pitchers Michael Connolly and Jake McCasland share a room, and Paré sleeps on a mattress on the dining room floor. Before heading home on this July night, Paré loaded a serving bin with chicken thighs and vegetarian lasagna; Nichols encouraged him to take as much as he wants. At nearly midnight, Paré finally headed for the clubhouse door, carrying his bounty with both hands. Barb Rothstein used to stay up late after her husband went to bed, opening beers and listening to the young men's stories. Barb and Bob invited the first of the players on the Norwich Navigators, at the time a New York Yankees Class-AA affiliate, to live rent-free in their Connecticut basement in 1996. Two years later, after visiting a few Latin Americans prospects' apartment shocking for both its grime and the landlord's price gouging, there were a dozen players and two wives spread through the house on futons, a mattress in their living room, sharing a room with their son. "I'm not the warm and fuzzy type," Barb would say much later. "But there was something about their living situations that I just couldn't stand." Some of the tales common on the minor league circuit are amusing: how smaller prospects sometimes climb into the team bus's luggage bin to sleep, the way a good meal on the road is a jug of peanut butter before flies or sweaty fingers contaminate it, that it was a good bet the team's bat boys were paid more per hour than the players. "I would be very confident to say that anyone working in that stadium was making more than we were, no matter what job they had," said Brett Newsome, a former Nationals farmhand and one of dozens of current and former minor leaguers interviewed for this story. Newsome is among the co-plaintiffs in the lawsuit against MLB. Players travel with air mattresses, sometimes the only constant in a life of change, and essentials aren't easy to come by. One former first-round draft pick said teammates often asked him to "over-order" baseball equipment from sponsors and distribute the extras within the clubhouse. Luxuries are even rarer: A trick known throughout the minors is to buy a television from Wal-Mart, use its box as a stand and return the TV on the 89th day of a 90-day return policy for a refund. Other stories are sad. Many of the Dominican players had been discovered in their early teens by buscónes, or searchers, the unlicensed scouts who work on commission and compel young and hopeful athletes to abandon their educations to play baseball full-time. The controversial system, in which players guarantee the buscón up to half of any future signing bonus in exchange for exposure to major league teams, is an inexpensive way for franchises to expand their scouting networks and for poverty-stricken families to go all-in on a high-risk gambit. If a player does eventually sign, he is sent to some faraway outpost to begin the climb through baseball's ranks. From there they attempt to gain footing in a new culture and are taught to play ball without complaints while nonetheless sending portions of their meager earnings to their families back home. Difo said he made between $400 and $500 every two weeks - or, he said in Spanish, "only enough to eat" after sending his mother a couple hundred dollars from each paycheck - until his salary multiplied six-fold when he was added in 2014 to the Nationals' 40-man roster. Another former player, the Venezuela-born pitcher Jose Mejias, signed with the Philadelphia Phillies at age 16 and spoke so little English he only felt comfortable communicating with hand gestures. After a few months, teammates started calling him "El Mudo," or The Mute. John Wesley, a former minor league player and pitching coach, said he used to sneak water to Dominican players because their apartment's tap output was brown and the young men could not spare $1.50 for a bottle. "These poor kids," said Wesley, who coached in the Toronto Blue Jays system. "It's a pyramid scam: Everything goes to the top. Nothing comes down." The Rothsteins, one of many host families who offer housing to minor leaguers, fit dozens of players in their 2,000-square foot house until a few years ago. Barb said they came to love their guests, and when one player moved up the ladder or gave up the dream, another took his place. In 2008, after the Giants took over the Norwich team, a tall 24-year-old pitcher named Garrett Broshuis moved in. He was from small-town Missouri and bookish, and like Barb, he too collected stories. Every once in a while, as he and Barb shared a few of their favorites, he'd wonder aloud if the system would ever change. Broshuis' office window overlooks downtown St. Louis and the Mississippi River, a wall decorated with reminders of an old life and a new one: his rookie card next to his admittance to the Missouri Bar Association. "I still love the game," Broshuis said, though a decade after signing a contract to play professional baseball, he was declaring war on it. In February 2014, he filed the lawsuit against MLB, its 30 franchises and former Commissioner Bud Selig. In it, he referred to the league as a "cartel." A former all-American at Missouri, he had tried, years earlier, to keep quiet and play. When a group of fans in Norwich watched him push-start the broken-down pickup he shared with a teammate, he shook it off as paying his dues. When he invited his then-girlfriend to his meager apartment, finding a room flooded by a neighbor's toilet upstairs, he assured himself brighter days awaited. He chronicled his experiences in articles for the Sporting News, though he squashed the grittier anecdotes and submitted the entries to the Giants for approval. But as the years passed, the stories ate away at his resolve: the Venezuelan teammate who struggled each month to send $20 back home to his pregnant girlfriend, the young pitchers worrying each month about how they'd pay their student loans. He was told by team officials that he was lucky to play, that the system had been in place for decades, that if he wanted to make more money, he should get better. Four days after his final game in 2009, he took the Law School Admission Test and was later accepted into St. Louis University's law school. He spoke with professors about a long-term plan to challenge a system that succeeded in part because the hopeful and desperate athletes continued to accept it for one prevailing reason: They always had. MLB filed an answer to the suit last year, denying the allegations in Broshuis's complaint. A league spokesman declined an interview request for this story, referring The Washington Post to a June statement comparing players to "artists, musicians and other creative professionals who are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act." "Like those professionals," the MLB statement went on, "it is simply impractical to treat professional athletes as hourly employees." Paré was on his 38th consecutive hour awake - games on consecutive nights and in stadiums 426 miles apart, one pitch to the head in the first one, a nine-hour bus ride in which he wasn't allowed to sleep because he was being evaluated for a possible concussion - and now it was approaching midnight. He put the leftover chicken and lasagna into the fridge, and when he opened the sliding pantry door it fell off the track. "Believe it or not," he said of the apartment, "the last place was worse." In this complex west of town, roughly 10 units are filled - packed, in some cases - with GreenJackets players and coaches. In here, the air conditioning rumbles and the front door must be slammed to close; Paré sat on carpet singed in places by a previous tenant, examining the lens on his video camera. All four players in this second-floor apartment hold second jobs at least part of the year. Connolly works construction during offseasons, McCasland is a substitute teacher and Sonabend spends part of the morning hours organizing online inventory for a pharmaceutical company. Neither pays especially well, but it's enough financial oxygen to keep the dream alive. Paré makes YouTube videos that poke fun at the plight of a "homeless minor leaguer," a light-hearted look at the lonely hours and inelegant lifestyle the common fan rarely sees. "You can sponsor a player right now," he implores viewers in one video inspired by those old "Save the Children" ads. Paré ends most videos by soliciting donations, and a good month - he collected $83 in July - means he doesn't have to negotiate food prices at Waffle House. A 26th-round draft pick out of high school by Houston in 2009, Paré elected to play at Boston College rather than accept the Astros' offer, which he said included a $200,000 signing bonus. He tore a meniscus as a sophomore, and scouts never viewed him the same. He wasn't drafted after his junior and senior seasons, but after a tryout in June2013, the Giants offered him a contract - this one offering $1,000 to sign. He met Sonabend, another undrafted former college catcher, at a voluntary camp last year before spring training. They traded stories and agreed that luck and persistence had led them to the professional ranks. Sonabend reached Class-AA Richmond last season, collecting a salary increase because of service time at a higher level, and this spring they were assigned to Augusta. Sonabend and Paré agreed to room together with Connolly and McCasland, collaborating on ways to cut costs: Paré sleeping in the dining room because the other residents pay for the Internet, Sonabend buying eggs a few times a week in exchange for use of Paré's SUV. Evenings are spent at the ballpark or at fan events; Paré has perfected the art of asking boosters for donations. This year the roommates have scored eyedrops, a few jugs of coffee, laundry detergent, a sofa and a potholder set. As Friday turned to Saturday, Paré not yet able to wind down, Connolly and McCasland came in through the front door and one of them wrestled it closed. "I brought lasagna!" Paré announced, but his roommates had stopped at a restaurant on the way home. Connolly wished he had known. "That could've saved me some bucks," the 24-year-old pitcher said. Paré returned his attention to the camera, a few ideas in mind for new videos, and Connolly approached the pantry. The door again fell off the track, and Connolly slammed it. "This whole place is a joke," he said, and all Paré could do was laugh. Paré was living rent-free in a cousin's spare bedroom last fall when the email arrived: "The purpose of this Notice," it read, "is to inform you of the existence of a collective action lawsuit against Major League Baseball." A group of former minor leaguers had formed a movement against the league, and hundreds more were adding their names. He thought about it and talked to people he trusted. He read articles about the attorney who had once played for the same organization now leading a charge against MLB. Paré wondered if, like the 1968 uprising that ultimately led to free agency, a victory here would be good for the game. And in the end, he couldn't be certain it would. He believed the Giants (who through a spokeswoman declined to comment for this article) and MLB had, all told, been good to him. Around 2,300 current and former players would opt-in on the suit, but Paré would not be one of them. He didn't want to take a side. He reported for spring training last February, reconnecting with Sonabend and Connolly, who also received the email but refused to add their names. "If I signed it," Connolly said, "it would almost be like me not appreciating the opportunity." Sonabend saw it similarly. "I knew what I was getting into," he said, "and I worked for it anyway." Last month, a California magistrate judge stripped the suit of its conditional class-action status. A setback, Broshuis admitted, but earlier this month the same judge granted a request to reconsider the class certification; a hearing is scheduled for Dec. 2. For now, Broshuis and the 41 co-plaintiffs wait, and for different reasons so do the young men in the apartment in west Augusta: Paré increasingly realistic about his baseball fate, Sonabend seeing how a former baseball castaway can climb, Connolly defiantly hopeful that the phone will someday ring, a voice on the other end inviting him to a higher level in the game and a better lifestyle. "It's only going to be a couple years and you filter out," Connolly said, "or you get that paycheck everybody dreams about." Early on a Saturday afternoon, another game a few hours away, Paré dressed for work. Sonabend joined him in the den, and they collected their bags. "Is Mike pitching?" Paré asked. "Who's pitching?" Sonabend shrugged. "Ready?" he said. "I'm ready," Paré said, and they walked into the midsummer sun, through a door that didn't want to close.

Paré shares a two-bedroom apartment with three teammates. He has, in four years as a professional ballplayer, accumulated a mountain of credit card debt. His experience is typical among players on pro baseball's ground floor, highlighting that financial struggle is, as much as promo nights and floodlit nostalgia, a minor league tradition. One that might, according to a lawsuit filed against Major League Baseball two years ago, violate federal and state minimum wage laws. "The organization traces its roots to the nineteenth century," reads the suit, filed in a California district court and led by 41 former players. "Unfortunately for many of its employees, its wage and labor practices remain stuck there." MLB has denied that its organizational structure is unlawful and rather provides opportunity to thousands of young athletes who want to make it to the big leagues. Indeed, many players say the sacrifices are worth it. "In reality I just wanted a chance," said Wilmer Difo, a Dominican-born player who, before being called up by the Washington Nationals last year, spent five seasons in the minor leagues and spent the majority of the 2013 season sleeping on an air mattress in an apartment with five other players. "That's everyone's dream, to get to the major leagues. But it's not always going to be like that. Not everyone. Unfortunately, not everyone, but there are a lot of people that depend on it anyway." Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred indicated to reporters in July that additional regulation could ultimately lead to smaller minor league rosters or fewer teams. The lawsuit has nonetheless turned a spotlight on a shadowy corner of a game in which players routinely put in 60-hour work weeks and must face continual personal and professional obstacles in the name of chasing a dream. Athletes from Latin America are particularly at risk. Many come to the United States from impoverished backgrounds with little or no knowledge of English, and lack both the cultural understanding of life in the country and network of family and friends that can help ease the burden. They are guaranteed a salary, health insurance and not much else. But there are reasons they keep playing: Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw's $33.8 million annual salary is the game's richest, and the average major league player earns $4.4 million per season. When the GreenJackets' season began, their highest salary belonged to Adam Sonabend, an undrafted 24-year-old catcher. His biweekly paycheck, after taxes, is $671. That's enough for Sonabend to have his own bedroom, which is more than his three roommates can say. GreenJackets pitchers Michael Connolly and Jake McCasland share a room, and Paré sleeps on a mattress on the dining room floor. Before heading home on this July night, Paré loaded a serving bin with chicken thighs and vegetarian lasagna; Nichols encouraged him to take as much as he wants. At nearly midnight, Paré finally headed for the clubhouse door, carrying his bounty with both hands. Barb Rothstein used to stay up late after her husband went to bed, opening beers and listening to the young men's stories. Barb and Bob invited the first of the players on the Norwich Navigators, at the time a New York Yankees Class-AA affiliate, to live rent-free in their Connecticut basement in 1996. Two years later, after visiting a few Latin Americans prospects' apartment shocking for both its grime and the landlord's price gouging, there were a dozen players and two wives spread through the house on futons, a mattress in their living room, sharing a room with their son. "I'm not the warm and fuzzy type," Barb would say much later. "But there was something about their living situations that I just couldn't stand." Some of the tales common on the minor league circuit are amusing: how smaller prospects sometimes climb into the team bus's luggage bin to sleep, the way a good meal on the road is a jug of peanut butter before flies or sweaty fingers contaminate it, that it was a good bet the team's bat boys were paid more per hour than the players. "I would be very confident to say that anyone working in that stadium was making more than we were, no matter what job they had," said Brett Newsome, a former Nationals farmhand and one of dozens of current and former minor leaguers interviewed for this story. Newsome is among the co-plaintiffs in the lawsuit against MLB. Players travel with air mattresses, sometimes the only constant in a life of change, and essentials aren't easy to come by. One former first-round draft pick said teammates often asked him to "over-order" baseball equipment from sponsors and distribute the extras within the clubhouse. Luxuries are even rarer: A trick known throughout the minors is to buy a television from Wal-Mart, use its box as a stand and return the TV on the 89th day of a 90-day return policy for a refund. Other stories are sad. Many of the Dominican players had been discovered in their early teens by buscónes, or searchers, the unlicensed scouts who work on commission and compel young and hopeful athletes to abandon their educations to play baseball full-time. The controversial system, in which players guarantee the buscón up to half of any future signing bonus in exchange for exposure to major league teams, is an inexpensive way for franchises to expand their scouting networks and for poverty-stricken families to go all-in on a high-risk gambit. If a player does eventually sign, he is sent to some faraway outpost to begin the climb through baseball's ranks. From there they attempt to gain footing in a new culture and are taught to play ball without complaints while nonetheless sending portions of their meager earnings to their families back home. Difo said he made between $400 and $500 every two weeks - or, he said in Spanish, "only enough to eat" after sending his mother a couple hundred dollars from each paycheck - until his salary multiplied six-fold when he was added in 2014 to the Nationals' 40-man roster. Another former player, the Venezuela-born pitcher Jose Mejias, signed with the Philadelphia Phillies at age 16 and spoke so little English he only felt comfortable communicating with hand gestures. After a few months, teammates started calling him "El Mudo," or The Mute. John Wesley, a former minor league player and pitching coach, said he used to sneak water to Dominican players because their apartment's tap output was brown and the young men could not spare $1.50 for a bottle. "These poor kids," said Wesley, who coached in the Toronto Blue Jays system. "It's a pyramid scam: Everything goes to the top. Nothing comes down." The Rothsteins, one of many host families who offer housing to minor leaguers, fit dozens of players in their 2,000-square foot house until a few years ago. Barb said they came to love their guests, and when one player moved up the ladder or gave up the dream, another took his place. In 2008, after the Giants took over the Norwich team, a tall 24-year-old pitcher named Garrett Broshuis moved in. He was from small-town Missouri and bookish, and like Barb, he too collected stories. Every once in a while, as he and Barb shared a few of their favorites, he'd wonder aloud if the system would ever change. Broshuis' office window overlooks downtown St. Louis and the Mississippi River, a wall decorated with reminders of an old life and a new one: his rookie card next to his admittance to the Missouri Bar Association. "I still love the game," Broshuis said, though a decade after signing a contract to play professional baseball, he was declaring war on it. In February 2014, he filed the lawsuit against MLB, its 30 franchises and former Commissioner Bud Selig. In it, he referred to the league as a "cartel." A former all-American at Missouri, he had tried, years earlier, to keep quiet and play. When a group of fans in Norwich watched him push-start the broken-down pickup he shared with a teammate, he shook it off as paying his dues. When he invited his then-girlfriend to his meager apartment, finding a room flooded by a neighbor's toilet upstairs, he assured himself brighter days awaited. He chronicled his experiences in articles for the Sporting News, though he squashed the grittier anecdotes and submitted the entries to the Giants for approval. But as the years passed, the stories ate away at his resolve: the Venezuelan teammate who struggled each month to send $20 back home to his pregnant girlfriend, the young pitchers worrying each month about how they'd pay their student loans. He was told by team officials that he was lucky to play, that the system had been in place for decades, that if he wanted to make more money, he should get better. Four days after his final game in 2009, he took the Law School Admission Test and was later accepted into St. Louis University's law school. He spoke with professors about a long-term plan to challenge a system that succeeded in part because the hopeful and desperate athletes continued to accept it for one prevailing reason: They always had. MLB filed an answer to the suit last year, denying the allegations in Broshuis's complaint. A league spokesman declined an interview request for this story, referring The Washington Post to a June statement comparing players to "artists, musicians and other creative professionals who are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act." "Like those professionals," the MLB statement went on, "it is simply impractical to treat professional athletes as hourly employees." Paré was on his 38th consecutive hour awake - games on consecutive nights and in stadiums 426 miles apart, one pitch to the head in the first one, a nine-hour bus ride in which he wasn't allowed to sleep because he was being evaluated for a possible concussion - and now it was approaching midnight. He put the leftover chicken and lasagna into the fridge, and when he opened the sliding pantry door it fell off the track. "Believe it or not," he said of the apartment, "the last place was worse." In this complex west of town, roughly 10 units are filled - packed, in some cases - with GreenJackets players and coaches. In here, the air conditioning rumbles and the front door must be slammed to close; Paré sat on carpet singed in places by a previous tenant, examining the lens on his video camera. All four players in this second-floor apartment hold second jobs at least part of the year. Connolly works construction during offseasons, McCasland is a substitute teacher and Sonabend spends part of the morning hours organizing online inventory for a pharmaceutical company. Neither pays especially well, but it's enough financial oxygen to keep the dream alive. Paré makes YouTube videos that poke fun at the plight of a "homeless minor leaguer," a light-hearted look at the lonely hours and inelegant lifestyle the common fan rarely sees. "You can sponsor a player right now," he implores viewers in one video inspired by those old "Save the Children" ads. Paré ends most videos by soliciting donations, and a good month - he collected $83 in July - means he doesn't have to negotiate food prices at Waffle House. A 26th-round draft pick out of high school by Houston in 2009, Paré elected to play at Boston College rather than accept the Astros' offer, which he said included a $200,000 signing bonus. He tore a meniscus as a sophomore, and scouts never viewed him the same. He wasn't drafted after his junior and senior seasons, but after a tryout in June2013, the Giants offered him a contract - this one offering $1,000 to sign. He met Sonabend, another undrafted former college catcher, at a voluntary camp last year before spring training. They traded stories and agreed that luck and persistence had led them to the professional ranks. Sonabend reached Class-AA Richmond last season, collecting a salary increase because of service time at a higher level, and this spring they were assigned to Augusta. Sonabend and Paré agreed to room together with Connolly and McCasland, collaborating on ways to cut costs: Paré sleeping in the dining room because the other residents pay for the Internet, Sonabend buying eggs a few times a week in exchange for use of Paré's SUV. Evenings are spent at the ballpark or at fan events; Paré has perfected the art of asking boosters for donations. This year the roommates have scored eyedrops, a few jugs of coffee, laundry detergent, a sofa and a potholder set. As Friday turned to Saturday, Paré not yet able to wind down, Connolly and McCasland came in through the front door and one of them wrestled it closed. "I brought lasagna!" Paré announced, but his roommates had stopped at a restaurant on the way home. Connolly wished he had known. "That could've saved me some bucks," the 24-year-old pitcher said. Paré returned his attention to the camera, a few ideas in mind for new videos, and Connolly approached the pantry. The door again fell off the track, and Connolly slammed it. "This whole place is a joke," he said, and all Paré could do was laugh. Paré was living rent-free in a cousin's spare bedroom last fall when the email arrived: "The purpose of this Notice," it read, "is to inform you of the existence of a collective action lawsuit against Major League Baseball." A group of former minor leaguers had formed a movement against the league, and hundreds more were adding their names. He thought about it and talked to people he trusted. He read articles about the attorney who had once played for the same organization now leading a charge against MLB. Paré wondered if, like the 1968 uprising that ultimately led to free agency, a victory here would be good for the game. And in the end, he couldn't be certain it would. He believed the Giants (who through a spokeswoman declined to comment for this article) and MLB had, all told, been good to him. Around 2,300 current and former players would opt-in on the suit, but Paré would not be one of them. He didn't want to take a side. He reported for spring training last February, reconnecting with Sonabend and Connolly, who also received the email but refused to add their names. "If I signed it," Connolly said, "it would almost be like me not appreciating the opportunity." Sonabend saw it similarly. "I knew what I was getting into," he said, "and I worked for it anyway." Last month, a California magistrate judge stripped the suit of its conditional class-action status. A setback, Broshuis admitted, but earlier this month the same judge granted a request to reconsider the class certification; a hearing is scheduled for Dec. 2. For now, Broshuis and the 41 co-plaintiffs wait, and for different reasons so do the young men in the apartment in west Augusta: Paré increasingly realistic about his baseball fate, Sonabend seeing how a former baseball castaway can climb, Connolly defiantly hopeful that the phone will someday ring, a voice on the other end inviting him to a higher level in the game and a better lifestyle. "It's only going to be a couple years and you filter out," Connolly said, "or you get that paycheck everybody dreams about." Early on a Saturday afternoon, another game a few hours away, Paré dressed for work. Sonabend joined him in the den, and they collected their bags. "Is Mike pitching?" Paré asked. "Who's pitching?" Sonabend shrugged. "Ready?" he said. "I'm ready," Paré said, and they walked into the midsummer sun, through a door that didn't want to close.

Get News Alerts Latest News © 2017 North Jersey Media Group August 26, 2016, 1:29 PM Last updated: Sunday, August 28, 2016, 10:16 AM Retailers online and in-store expect boost from back-to-school shopping By JOAN VERDON STAFF WRITER |  The Record Ho-Ho-Kus mom Lisa Pisano, creator and editorial director of the website momalamode.net, describes herself as a big fan of online shopping. She’s ordered groceries and lighting fixtures for a home-construction project online. And she recently became an Amazon Prime member. But when it was time for an important back-to-school ritual — letting her 6-year-old son pick out his lunchbox — she did that at the Target store at Bergen Town Center in Paramus. TARIQ ZEHAWI / STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Michelle Tzoulafis, of Ridgewood, shops for her two daughters at Little Skye. Back to school shopping at Little Skye kids store. Her son surveyed the selection and picked out an Angry Birds lunchbox, “That was his way to express his creativity and his likes.” Pisano said. ToniAnne Lisante , a Maywood mother of three, also is a frequent online shopper, but she finds that back-to-school shopping usually requires store visits. “Back-to-school also means back-to-your-extracurricular activities — dance class starting, sports starting,” she said. “You have to bring your children to the store because how else are you going to try on the shoes, the cleats.” VIOREL FLORESCU/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Edison Guaman of North Bergen shopping at Walmart for Back-to-School shopping season. Retailers and shopping center owners are confident that the majority of American moms agree with Lisante, and that most will make multiple visits to physical stores during the peak weeks of the back-to-school shopping season. In North Jersey, those visits begin this week and run through the second weekend in September. Even so, online shopping is expected to continue to take a growing bite out of store sales, as parents combine store visits with purchases on the web. A survey released by the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC) last month found that 95 percent of back-to-school shoppers plan to make purchases in stores. The survey, however, also found that most of those shoppers will be buying online as well. The ICSC and other industry groups are predicting a healthy growth spurt for back-to-school sales this year. However, online buying could steal dollars from traditional stores. According to the ICSC survey, 78 percent of back-to-school shoppers plan to spend more this year, up from the 67 percent who said they would spend more when surveyed in 2015. A survey by the National Retail Federation, also released last month, found that parents of school- and college-age children planned to spend 11 percent more than last year’s forecast. “Families are still looking for bargains, but there are signs that they are less worried about the economy than in the past,” NRF President and Chief Executive Officer Matthew Shay said, when the survey results were released. Research firm IHS Global Insight is predicting that retail sales during the back-to-school season of July through September — excluding autos, gasoline and restaurant meals — will increase by 4 percent, compared with 3.8 percent over the same period in 2015. Another reason retailers are optimistic about the back-to-school season, despite sluggish sales in June and July, is apparel inventory levels are tighter than a year ago. That is expected to result in less discounting and lead to improved margins. “They’ve learned their lesson from over-discounting last year,” said Chris G. Christopher, director of consumer economics for IHS Global Insight. RetailMeNot, the shopping savings and coupons website, is seeing retailers re-think their discounting strategy this year. “Retailers are getting smarter about offering the right promotions, for the right length of time, combined with the right discount,” said Michelle Skupin, senior director of global corporate communications for RetailMeNot.  An ongoing challenge for physical stores and shopping malls is competing with rapidly growing online sales. Christopher said online sales will again make up a larger percentage of total back-to-school sales. “We expect approximately one dollar out of every 5.4 dollars of back-to-school retail sales to be spent online this year, compared to one dollar out of 5.9 dollars in 2015,” Christopher said. In 2005, online spending accounted for only $1 out of every $11 spent, Christopher said, underscoring the size and speed of the shift to online shopping. At Little Skye, a children’s clothing store at 171 E. Ridgewood Ave. in downtown Ridgewood, owners Melissa Troise and Paul Bordieri are reaching out to both the online shopper moms and those who prefer store shopping by having a strong web business and a physical store. The company sold clothes online only for the first nine years it was in business, and opened the Ridgewood store a year ago. It is so pleased with the response to the Ridgewood store, Bordieri said, that it is hoping to eventually open four more. “With children’s clothing, a lot of moms want to come in and touch it,” Bordieri said. One-third of the shoppers surveyed by the ICSC said they plan to buy back-to-school items online, but pick them up in a physical store. Retailers with both online and physical stores, such as Walmart, Toys “R’’ Us and Macy’s, are encouraging that trend, because they believe someone who comes to a store to pick up an order is likely to buy additional items there. The ICSC survey confirmed the likelihood of that happening, with 84 percent of shoppers who plan to order online and pick up in store saying they will make more purchases there. Walmart in particular has been pushing the order-online, pick-up-in-store shopping option this year, making more than 200 back-to-school items available for the pickup service. Aaron Klein, manager of the Walmart in Secaucus, said online sales at his store are up 41 percent this year. He said he also is seeing strong in-store response by parents to low prices on items such as pencils and other school supplies. A $6.88 lunchbox has been a particularly hot seller, he said. Back-to-school shopping is an important season for two North Jersey-based retail chains — The Children’s Place in Secaucus and Wayne-based Toys “R” Us. The Children’s Place, the country’s largest children’s specialty clothing chain with more than 1,000 stores in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico, plans for the back-to-school season with the intensity other retailers devote to the holiday season. “As one of the largest specialty children’s apparel retailers in the country, this season will always be important to us because parents have a specific motivator to shop this time of year,” said Jennifer Groves, senior vice president of design at The Children’s Place, in an email. Trends lifting the company’s stores this year include denim jeans and stretch jeggings, and clothes and accessories with emoji and hashtag designs. “We’re celebrating kids growing up in the digital age with fun and age-appropriate emojis,” Groves said. At Toys “R” Us, back-to-school is a good warm-up for its most important season, the holidays, and also an early indicator of which licensed toy characters will be holiday hits. This year, merchandise such as backpacks and lunchboxes related to the animated PJ Masks television series on the Disney channel looks like a top back-to-school seller, said Jamie Uidtenhowen. vice president and general merchandising manager at Toys “R” Us. “Every year at this time we get great reads off of the licenses for fall, and we’re really optimistic with what we’re seeing from that property,” he said. The Toys “R’’ Us stores this year also are carrying a new line of Lego-themed school supplies, and those are selling well, he said. Toys “R’’ Us this year also has been trying to integrate its educational STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) toy offerings with its back-to-school promotions. “We have our back-to-school ads and catalogs that go out in July and August and we wove in a lot of STEM products and deals in there,” he said. Displays of STEM products such as science kits also were added to the back-to-school aisles in the stores. In North Jersey, the weekend before most schools open and the weekend after typically are the busiest times at the malls. Lisa Herrmann-Srednicki, senior director of marketing for Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus, New Jersey’s largest mall, said the shopping center has already been busy, “with a strong back-to-school shopping season.” Email: verdon@northjersey.com NorthJersey.com : News NorthJersey.com : News August 26, 2016, 1:29 PM Last updated: Sunday, August 28, 2016, 10:16 AM Retailers online and in-store expect boost from back-to-school shopping Buy this photo TARIQ ZEHAWI / STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Michelle Tzoulafis, of Ridgewood, shops for her two daughters at Little Skye.

This year, merchandise such as backpacks and lunchboxes related to the animated PJ Masks television series on the Disney channel looks like a top back-to-school seller, said Jamie Uidtenhowen. vice president and general merchandising manager at Toys “R” Us. “Every year at this time we get great reads off of the licenses for fall, and we’re really optimistic with what we’re seeing from that property,” he said. The Toys “R’’ Us stores this year also are carrying a new line of Lego-themed school supplies, and those are selling well, he said. Toys “R’’ Us this year also has been trying to integrate its educational STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) toy offerings with its back-to-school promotions. “We have our back-to-school ads and catalogs that go out in July and August and we wove in a lot of STEM products and deals in there,” he said. Displays of STEM products such as science kits also were added to the back-to-school aisles in the stores. In North Jersey, the weekend before most schools open and the weekend after typically are the busiest times at the malls. Lisa Herrmann-Srednicki, senior director of marketing for Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus, New Jersey’s largest mall, said the shopping center has already been busy, “with a strong back-to-school shopping season.” Email: verdon@northjersey.com Tags: News  |  Business Inside NorthJersey.com Today's celebrity birthdays:...

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States Netflix Finishes First in Streaming Survey By Paul Ausick August 26, 2016 8:50 am EST Print Email Tweet In the first quarter of this year, half of all U.S. households had a paid subscription to a video streaming service. That is the same percentage as the number of households that use a digital video recorder (DVR), but the streaming number is rising while the DVR number appears to have plateaued. Among five major U.S. subscription streaming services, the best, according to a recent survey by J.D. Power, is Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX). Hulu, which is owned by a consortium including Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS), Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. (NASDAQ: FOXA), Comcast Corp. (NASDAQ: CMCSA) and, since earlier this month, Time Warner Inc. (NYSE: TWX), was ranked second. The J.D. Power study measured customer satisfaction on six key metrics: performance and reliability; content; cost of service; ease of use; communication; and customer service. Scores for each measure are reflected in an index based on a 1,000-point scale. Top ranked Netflix scored 829 and Hulu scored 821. The industry average score was 820. Third-ranked Vudu, owned by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT), scored 810, Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) iTunes scored 807 and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) scored 806. Netflix led or tied for the lead on all six metrics, and it scored exceptionally well on performance/reliability and customer service. Hulu’s cost of service and communication were its highest scoring metrics. Among the more interesting things that emerged from the study is that 60% of streaming video subscribers also subscribe to a traditional cable/satellite service (cord stackers). Just 13% are cord-cutters and 4% are cord-nevers; that is, they have never subscribed to cable/satellite programming. Another 23% subscribe to both pay TV and streaming but have reduced their pay-TV package (cord shavers). How satisfied were people with streaming video? That depends. Using the 1,000-point scale, cord cutters were the least satisfied (802) closely followed by cord-nevers (807). Satisfaction with their streaming service was highest among cord stackers (826) and cord shavers (822). Other findings from the J.D. Power survey include: Binge-Watching High: Nearly two-thirds (62%) of customers use a streaming service to binge watch—the act of watching multiple episodes in succession—TV programming. Overall satisfaction is 35 points higher among those who binge watch vs. those who do not (834 vs. 799, respectively). As binge-watching sessions increase in duration, so does overall satisfaction: 823 among those whose most recent session lasted less than four hours; 841 among those whose session lasted 4-8 hours; and 858 among those whose session lasted 8 or more hours. Television Remains Primary Viewing Device: Nearly two-thirds (65%) of customers view streaming content through their TV; 55% view content on a laptop/desktop computer; and 48% view content on a mobile device. More than half (56%) of viewers use multiple devices to watch streaming video. Original Content Viewership Higher among Streaming-Only Subscribers: More than half (54%) of cord nevers and 49% of cord cutters view original content vs. 43% of cord shavers and 41% of cord stackers. A J.D. Power executive summarizes: The streaming video customer experience appears to be stratifying across the different subscriber segments, with pay TV service still having a major effect on the overall streaming video experience. Part of the reason is demographics. Customers who only stream are younger than those who also have TV. Nearly two-fifths (37%) of customers who only stream are 18-34 years old, compared with 30% of those who also have TV. Notably, 52% of cord nevers are 18-34. Also, streaming-only customers are less likely to use transaction-based streaming services, which perform higher in the content measure. The 2016 Streaming Video Satisfaction Study is based on responses from 3,928 customers. The study was fielded in June and July, 2016.

News Week In Review: 'Strengthened' Yellen, Mylan EpiPen Furor, Best Buy Hot, Dollar Stores Pinched Mylan CEO Heather Bresch came under heavy fire for the drugmaker's big EpiPen price hikes. (AP) IBD STAFF 8/26/2016 Reprints Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said the case for a rate hike is stronger now, but investors weren't sure what to make of that. Pfizer (PFE) paid $14 billion for a one-drug biotech, but shares of drugs and pharma supply chain companies sold off as Mylan's (MYL) EpiPen price hikes drew outrage. Best Buy (BBY) earnings surprised investors, while dollar stores came under pressure. Stocks Retreat, Sideways Trade Continues For the week, the Nasdaq fell 0.4%, the S&P 500 0.7% and the Dow 0.8%. The major averages are still in sideways action. Drug stocks were big movers on Pfizer's Medivation (MDVN) deal and Mylan's EpiPen furor. Dollar stores suffered heavy losses as competition from Wal-Mart (WMT) was heating up. Yellen: Rate Hike Case 'Strengthened' Fed Chair Janet Yellen said at Friday's long-awaited speech that the case for an interest rate hike has "strengthened in recent months." That followed other modestly hawkish statements from fellow Fed policymakers. However, Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said Yellen's comments were consistent with a September rate increase. He saw the possibility of two rate hikes this year. Markets had already priced a Fed move, perhaps in December, but they don't expect any quick follow-up House (Data) Divided New-home sales soared to a 654,000 annual rate in July, by far the highest since October 2007, the Commerce Department reported. The 12% rise from June surprised economists looking for a slight dip to 580,000. Luxury homebuilder Toll Bros. (TOL) confirmed that the high end of the market is prospering, reporting a 69% jump in third-quarter earnings per share, a 23.5% rise in revenue and a strong backlog of orders. Existing-home sales fell more than expected in July, though that was from June's cycle high. But applications for loans to buy a home fell to a six-month low. Toll shares soared to a seven-month high, moving above their 200-day moving average. Durable goods orders jumped 4.4% in July, or 1.5% excluding transportation, with both results better than expected. Core capital goods orders rose 1.5% after a small June gain, the first back-to-back increase for the business investment proxy since January 2015. Mylan's Epic-Pen Failure The generic drugmaker Mylan sold off 11.55% for the week as members of the Senate and other politicians started inquiring into its price increases on its emergency allergy drug/device EpiPen. That fueled selling in drug and biotech stocks. Mylan CEO Heather Bresch, daughter of Sen. Joe Machin, D-W.V., said only a fraction of the $608 list price makes it back to Mylan, due to all the middlemen, leading shares of Express Scripts (ESRX), CVS Health (CVS) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) to fall as well. Pfizer Buys Medivation, Antibiotics Big pharma Pfizer agreed to buy Medivation for $14 billion in cash, snatching the cancer-drug specialist from Sanofi (SNY), which had been trying for months to acquire Medivation. Biotechs rallied Monday on the news, with BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) jumping on rumors that it was Sanofi's second choice of target. On Wednesday, Pfizer agreed to buy the antibiotics business of AstraZeneca (AZN) for $725 million plus possible future milestone and sales payments and royalties that could amount to $850 million. Oil Settles In Oil prices may be settling into a trading range in the mid to high $40 range. OPEC members gave conflicting signals over whether they might support a production freeze, while Goldman Sachs said such a move would not "be sufficient to support prices much further." Meanwhile, the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude inventories rose by 2.5 million barrels vs. expectations for a small drop. Domestic production fell slightly. Mobileye The road to self-driving cars got a little more crowded as Mobileye (MBLY) announced it will partner with General Motors (GM) supplier Delphi Automotive (DLPH) to jointly develop off-the-shelf autonomous driving technology for automakers. The two companies will co-develop "the market's first turnkey Level 4/5 automated driving solution." Mobileye already has deal with BMW (BMWYY) and Intel (INTC) to bring an autonomous vehicle to market by 2021. Mobileye shares spiked Tuesday on the Delphi news, briefly topping a buy point. Shares rose 2.3% for the week. Tesla Motors (TSLA), which is ending its business relationship with Mobileye, introduced new versions of its Model S and X that boosts speeds and driving range, powered by an updated battery technology. Tesla said its upgraded Model S is now the fastest-accelerating car in commercial production. Tesla shares fell 2.2%, closing below the 50-day line and just above the 200-day line. Tesla partner Nvidia (NVDA) unveiled a new processor for autonomous driving, saying it's 50%-100% more powerful than other mobile processors. Ulta Beauty Guidance Flawed The beauty products retailer reported better-than-expected earnings and sales, with yet another quarter of double-digit same-stores growth. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) also raised full-year EPS guidance. But its Q3 profit range was a little cautious. Ulta shares have been on a strong run-up, so it may have been priced for perfection. Ulta shares tumbled 6% on Friday, undercutting its 50-day moving average. Workday Workday (WDAY) reported a wider-than-expected Q2 adjusted loss. But it topped on some key metrics, including revenue, which rose 34% to $377.7 million. But shares of the cloud-based human resources software maker rose 2.5%, hitting a 2016 high on Thursday. Talend July IPO Talend (TLND) lost an adjusted $1.84 a share, according to its late Thursday release, but the French Big Data firm later clarified that the bottom line actually met estimates for a loss of 31 cents a share after adjusting for the share count following its initial offering. Revenue rose 38% to $25.4 million, just beating. Talend sees Q3 losses in line with views, but it guided revenue slightly higher. Shares fell 4% after much bigger intraday losses. Best Buy, GameStop Divide Investors Best Buy (BBY) stock jumped 21% for the week to a 17-month high on better-than-expected sales and earnings for its fiscal second quarter, including a surprise increase in same-store sales. The consumer electronics retailer credited rising demand for wearable technology, appliances and home-theater systems for the increase. Video game and electronics retailer GameStop (GME) disappointed investors with in-line EPS and below-forecast sales. Dollar Stores Are Discounted Discount retailers Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) suffered double-digit share price losses, as both reported second-quarter results that came up short of Wall Street expectations, with falling grocery prices and tougher competition hurting sales. Those results came as Wal-Mart is waging its own campaign to cut prices, a move that could draw more customers who have become more cautious with their spending. Jewelers Mixed Meanwhile, the jeweler Tiffany (TIF) held to its full-year outlook, while its Q2 EPS beat views, helping to boost shares. However, Signet Jewelers (SIG), the parent of mall jewelers Kay, Jared and Zales, slashed its fiscal-year outlook, partly due to difficulties "in the energy-dependent regions." Those regions' economies have been hurt by cheap oil and other commodities. HP Beats, But Guidance Weak HP Inc. (HPQ) reported that its fiscal Q3 earnings per share minus one-time items jumped 37% in fiscal Q3 to 48 cents on a 4% decline in sales to $11.89 billion, both better than views. For the current quarter, the printer and PC maker sees non-GAAP EPS of 34-37 cents, vs. consensus for 41 cents. HP is reducing its printing supplies inventory and is deeply discounting printers to expand its installed base. Shares closed little changed after a brief Thursday morning sell-off.

Listen Listening... / 2:38 Listen to the radio story. I’d been wondering about Payao’s Thai Cookin’ for a while. It’s this one story wood shack, with a hand painted sign advertising thai food—it surprises me every time it pops up along the Franklin Pierce turnpike between Concord and the Seacoast. One summer night I ask my friend Brendan to meet me there—he doesn’t find it right away. "I drove right by it I did not see it at first even though the address was in my phone. And it was only when I saw it that I had to turn around in a kind of trailer park cul-de-sac." Colored Christmas lights hang over the porch, the smell of steamed noodles and curry wafts out on to the gravel parking lot. Just behind our cars are a meadow and a chicken coop. Payao Murphy meets us at the order window. "I’m Payao and I’m in my kitchen." Payao came to the states from Thailand 40 years ago. For a while she worked at Wal Mart, but she got sick of it, and one day while hauling one too many boxes of produce, ago she got the idea to start this place. "Do you guys recommend anything?" "Do you like coconut?" She stands at her stove, in front of four hot pans full of chili oil and coconut milk, with the pride of someone who’s finally doing what she wants to do. "I’m make a hot coconut entrée. Red curry. I put my hot coconut entrée." She stirs curry paste into one of the pans and lowers some egg rolls she’s just folded down into the frying basket. "Some people they’re here every week. Some times two times a week, they love hot coconut entrée." Most of the time, Payao’s in here alone—they’re open five days a week, through the afternoon and evening. But sometimes her husband comes and helps her out. "My names’s Jason, Jason Ricci. Co-owner of Payao’s Thai Kitchen." Jason’s born and raised in New Hampshire, and he and Payao met here. This is a pretty rural part of the state, surrounded by woods and lakes, and he says a lot of their customers have never had thai food before. "We had some first customers who were unfamiliar to the Thai food. And it is a little different and the expectation of the taste...some people are a little surprised." Which is why, Payao says, a lot of people told her they didn’t stand a chance. She says it feels good to prove them wrong. "Yeah they said we’re not gonna make it, but we did, we made it." Brendan and I sit down at the picnic table outside to eat. As the sun sets, cars keep pulling in—maybe they’re from down the road, maybe they came a long way, just for more of Payao’s thai cooking.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) ranks first among all providers in terms of customer satisfaction. From 24/7 Wall St.: J.D. Power study measured customer satisfaction on six key metrics: performance and reliability; content; cost of service; ease of use; communication; and customer service. Scores for each measure are reflected in an index based on a 1,000-point scale. Top ranked Netflix scored 829 and Hulu scored 821. The industry average score was 820. Third-ranked Vudu, owned by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT), scored 810, Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iTunes scored 807 and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) scored 806. Netflix led or tied for the lead on all six metrics, and it scored exceptionally well on performance/reliability and customer service. Hulu’s cost of service and communication were its highest scoring metrics. From J.D. Power itself: The streaming video customer experience appears to be stratifying across the different subscriber segments, with pay TV service still having a major effect on the overall streaming video experience. Part of the reason is demographics. Customers who only stream are younger than those who also have TV. Nearly two-fifths (37%) of customers who only stream are 18-34 years old, compared with 30% of those who also have TV. Notably, 52% of cord nevers are 18-34. Also, streaming-only customers are less likely to use transaction-based streaming services, which perform higher in the content measure. Despite having the highest customer satisfaction levels in the segment, and a huge amount of original programming, Netflix has struggled to achieve its ambitious growth goals. Netflix shares fell $0.31 (-0.32%) to $97.01 in Friday morning trading. NFLX has plunged 15% this year, hurt mainly by slowing subscriber growth.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Kent Babb and Jorge Castillo August 26, 2016 Follow kentbabb Follow @jorgeccastillo A rainbow arches across the sky over Lake Olmstead Stadium during the playing of the national anthem as Class-A Augusta GreenJackets play the Delmarva Shorebirds in Augusta on July 15. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post) AUGUSTA, Ga. — They trickled into the mid-July night, a rain-shortened loss beginning their Friday night early. A 25-year-old catcher hung back. Matt Paré chatted with teammates and underwent a long treatment session as other Augusta GreenJackets players exited through a clubhouse door wedged open with a broken bat. He kept himself awake with a marathon shower. By the time Paré dressed, he had the clubhouse to himself, along with what was left of the GreenJackets’ postgame buffet. “What have we got, Sarge?” he called toward clubhouse manager Kristopher Nichols, a former Army drill sergeant who appreciates — and usually rewards — Paré’s resourcefulness. Paré is the oldest player for the San Francisco Giants’ Class A affiliate, and he begins most homestands by waiting out his teammates in order to stockpile free food. Far away from Major League Baseball’s mighty salaries and Hollywood glitz, Paré is among the thousands of minor leaguers who survive on baseball earnings below the federal poverty line. Baseball has in recent years parlayed renewed popularity into record earnings, leveraging apparel and media demands into $9.5 billion in revenue last year; its 30 franchises averaged $23 million in profits in 2015, and many of its minor league affiliates saw attendance figures and team values continue a steady climb. But the overwhelming majority of players in professional baseball’s extensive player development system never see a cut of that wealth. More than 80 percent of draft picks will never reach the big leagues, and most live on salaries of less than $10,000 per season; the starting salary for a first-year player, paid only during the regular season, is $1,100 a month. “You always question yourself: Should I be doing this?” said Paré, who says he is making about $7,500 in salary during this 22-week season — a little more than $340 a week, or about $8.50 an hour. Paré shares a two-bedroom apartment with three teammates. He has, in four years as a professional ballplayer, accumulated a mountain of credit card debt. Matt Paré leaves the stadium in Augusta carrying left over food from the clubhouse. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post) His experience is typical among players on professional baseball’s ground floor, highlighting that financial struggle is, as much as promotional nights and floodlit nostalgia, a minor league tradition. One that might, according to a lawsuit filed against Major League Baseball two years ago, violate federal and state minimum wage laws. “The organization traces its roots to the nineteenth century,” reads the suit, filed in a California district court and led by 41 former players. “Unfortunately for many of its employees, its wage and labor practices remain stuck there.” MLB has denied that its organizational structure is unlawful, saying it provides opportunity to thousands of young athletes who want to make it to the big leagues. Indeed, many players say the sacrifices are worth it. “In reality I just wanted a chance,” said Wilmer Difo, a Dominican-born player who, before being called up by the Washington Nationals last year, spent five seasons in the minor leagues and spent the majority of the 2013 season sleeping on an air mattress in an apartment with five other players. “That’s everyone’s dream, to get to the major leagues. But it’s not always going to be like that. Not everyone. Unfortunately, not everyone, but there are a lot of people that depend on it anyway.” [Difo shines on short notice for the Nationals] Wilmer Difo in the dugout before a Nationals game against the San Francisco Giants on Aug. 5 (Nick Wass/Associated Press) Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred indicated to reporters in July that additional regulation could ultimately lead to smaller minor league rosters or fewer teams. The lawsuit has nonetheless turned a spotlight on a shadowy corner of a game in which players routinely put in 60-hour work weeks and face continual personal and professional obstacles in the name of chasing a dream. Athletes from Latin America are particularly at risk. Many come to the United States from impoverished backgrounds with little or no knowledge of English, and lack both the cultural understanding of life in the country and network of family and friends that can help ease the burden. They are guaranteed a salary, health insurance and not much else. But there are reasons they keep playing: Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw’s $33.8 million annual salary is the game’s richest, and the average major league player earns $4.4 million per season. When the GreenJackets’ season began, their highest salary belonged to Adam Sonabend, an undrafted 24-year-old catcher. His biweekly paycheck, after taxes, is $671. That’s enough for Sonabend to have his own bedroom, which is more than his three roommates can say. GreenJackets pitchers Michael Connolly and Jake McCasland share a room, and Paré sleeps on a mattress on the dining room floor. Before heading home on this July night, Paré loaded a serving bin with chicken thighs and vegetarian lasagna; Nichols encouraged him to take as much as he wants. At nearly midnight, Paré finally headed for the clubhouse door, carrying his bounty with both hands. Adam Sonabend waits for roommate Matt Paré to gather his things from the floor mattress where he sleeps in the apartment they share in Augusta with two teammates. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post) Only enough to eat Barb Rothstein used to stay up late after her husband went to bed, opening beers and listening to the young men’s stories. Barb and Bob invited the first of the players on the Norwich Navigators, at the time a New York Yankees Class AA affiliate, to live rent-free in their Connecticut basement in 1996. Two years later, after visiting a few Latin American prospects’ apartment shocking for both its grime and the landlord’s price gouging, there were a dozen players and two wives spread through the house on futons, a mattress in their living room, sharing a room with their son. “I’m not the warm and fuzzy type,” Barb would say much later. “But there was something about their living situations that I just couldn’t stand.” Some of the tales common on the minor league circuit are amusing: how smaller prospects sometimes climb into the team bus’s luggage bin to sleep, the way a good meal on the road is a jug of peanut butter before flies or sweaty fingers contaminate it, that it was a good bet the team’s bat boys were paid more per hour than the players. “I would be very confident to say that anyone working in that stadium was making more than we were, no matter what job they had,” said Brett Newsome, a former Nationals farmhand and one of dozens of current and former minor leaguers interviewed for this story. Newsome is among the co-plaintiffs in the lawsuit against MLB. Paré opens a box of eggs as Sonabend eats an apple with peanut butter in their kitchen. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post) Players travel with air mattresses, sometimes the only constant in a life of change, and essentials aren’t easy to come by. One former first-round draft pick said teammates often asked him to “over-order” baseball equipment from sponsors and distribute the extras within the clubhouse. Luxuries are even rarer: A trick known throughout the minors is to buy a television from Walmart, use its box as a stand and return the TV on the 89th day of a 90-day return policy for a refund. Other stories are sad. Many of the Dominican players had been discovered in their early teens by buscónes, or searchers, the unlicensed scouts who work on commission and compel young and hopeful athletes to abandon their educations to play baseball full-time. The controversial system, in which players guarantee the buscón up to half of any future signing bonus in exchange for exposure to major league teams, is an inexpensive way for franchises to expand their scouting networks and for poverty-stricken families to go all-in on a high-risk gambit. If a player does eventually sign, he is sent to some faraway outpost to begin the climb through baseball’s ranks. From there they attempt to gain footing in a new culture and are taught to play ball without complaints while nonetheless sending portions of their meager earnings to their families back home. Difo said he made between $400 and $500 every two weeks — or, he said in Spanish, “only enough to eat” after sending his mother a couple hundred dollars from each paycheck — until his salary multiplied six-fold when he was added in 2014 to the Nationals’ 40-man roster. Another former player, the Venezuela-born pitcher Jose Mejias, signed with the Philadelphia Phillies at age 16 and spoke so little English he only felt comfortable communicating with hand gestures. After a few months, teammates started calling him “El Mudo,” or The Mute. John Wesley, a former minor league player and pitching coach, said he used to sneak water to Dominican players because their apartment’s tap output was brown and the young men could not spare $1.50 for a bottle. “These poor kids,” said Wesley, who coached in the Toronto Blue Jays system. “It’s a pyramid scam: Everything goes to the top. Nothing comes down.” The Rothsteins, one of many host families who offer housing to minor leaguers, fit dozens of players in their 2,000-square foot house until a few years ago. Barb said they came to love their guests, and when one player moved up the ladder or gave up the dream, another took his place. In 2008, after the Giants took over the Norwich team, a tall 24-year-old pitcher named Garrett Broshuis moved in. He was from small-town Missouri and bookish, and like Barb, he too collected stories. Every once in a while, as he and Barb shared a few of their favorites, he’d wonder aloud if the system would ever change. Challenging a system Broshuis’s office window overlooks downtown St. Louis and the Mississippi River, a wall decorated with reminders of an old life and a new one: his rookie card next to his admittance to the Missouri Bar Association. “I still love the game,” Broshuis said, though a decade after signing a contract to play professional baseball, he was declaring war on it. In February 2014, he filed the lawsuit against MLB, its 30 franchises and former Commissioner Bud Selig. In it, he referred to the league as a “cartel.” Attorney and former minor league baseball pitcher Garrett Broshuis in his St. Louis office this month. (Whitney Curtis/For The Washington Post) A former all-American at Missouri, he had tried, years earlier, to keep quiet and play. When a group of fans in Norwich watched him push-start the broken-down pickup he shared with a teammate, he shook it off as paying his dues. When he invited his then-girlfriend to his meager apartment, finding a room flooded by a neighbor’s toilet upstairs, he assured himself brighter days awaited. He chronicled his experiences in articles for the Sporting News, though he squashed the grittier anecdotes and submitted the entries to the Giants for approval. But as the years passed, the stories ate away at his resolve: the Venezuelan teammate who struggled each month to send $20 back home to his pregnant girlfriend, the young pitchers worrying each month about how they’d pay their student loans. He was told by team officials that he was lucky to play, that the system had been in place for decades, that if he wanted to make more money, he should get better. Four days after his final game in 2009, he took the Law School Admission Test and was later accepted into St. Louis University’s law school. He spoke with professors about a long-term plan to challenge a system that succeeded in part because the hopeful and desperate athletes continued to accept it for one prevailing reason: They always had. [Lawsuit alleges ‘many minor leaguers to live in poverty’ ] MLB filed an answer to the suit last year, denying the allegations in Broshuis’s complaint. A league spokesman declined an interview request for this story, referring The Washington Post to a June statement comparing players to “artists, musicians and other creative professionals who are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act.” “Like those professionals,” the MLB statement went on, “it is simply impractical to treat professional athletes as hourly employees.” Ways to cut costs Paré was on his 38th consecutive hour awake — games on consecutive nights and in stadiums 426 miles apart, one pitch to the head in the first one, a nine-hour bus ride in which he wasn’t allowed to sleep because he was being evaluated for a possible concussion — and now it was approaching midnight. He put the leftover chicken and lasagna into the fridge, and when he opened the sliding pantry door it fell off the track. “Believe it or not,” he said of the apartment, “the last place was worse.” In this complex west of town, roughly 10 units are filled — packed, in some cases — with GreenJackets players and coaches. In here, the air conditioning rumbles and the front door must be slammed to close; Paré sat on carpet singed in places by a previous tenant, examining the lens on his video camera. Matt Paré prepares a five-egg breakfast. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post) All four players in this second-floor apartment hold second jobs at least part of the year. Connolly works construction during offseasons, McCasland is a substitute teacher and Sonabend spends part of the morning hours organizing online inventory for a pharmaceutical company. None pays especially well, but they provide enough financial oxygen to keep the dream alive. Paré makes YouTube videos that poke fun at the plight of a “homeless minor leaguer,” a light-hearted look at the lonely hours and inelegant lifestyle the common fan rarely sees. “You can sponsor a player right now,” he implores viewers in one video inspired by those old “Save the Children” ads. Paré ends most videos by soliciting donations, and a good month — he collected $83 in July — means he doesn’t have to negotiate food prices at Waffle House. A 26th-round draft pick out of high school by Houston in 2009, Paré elected to play at Boston College rather than accept the Astros’ offer, which he said included a $200,000 signing bonus. He tore a meniscus as a sophomore, and scouts never viewed him the same. He wasn’t drafted after his junior and senior seasons, but after a tryout in June 2013, the Giants offered him a contract — this one offering $1,000 to sign. He met Sonabend, another undrafted former college catcher, at a voluntary camp last year before spring training. They traded stories and agreed that luck and persistence had led them to the professional ranks. Sonabend reached Class AA Richmond last season, collecting a salary increase because of service time at a higher level, and this spring they were assigned to Augusta. Sonabend and Paré agreed to room together with Connolly and McCasland, collaborating on ways to cut costs: Paré sleeping in the dining room because the other residents pay for the Internet, Sonabend buying eggs a few times a week in exchange for use of Paré’s SUV. Evenings are spent at the ballpark or at fan events; Paré has perfected the art of asking boosters for donations. This year the roommates have scored eyedrops, a few jugs of coffee, laundry detergent, a sofa and a potholder set. As Friday turned to Saturday, Paré not yet able to wind down, Connolly and McCasland came in through the front door and one of them wrestled it closed. “I brought lasagna!” Paré announced, but his roommates had stopped at a restaurant on the way home. Connolly wished he had known. “That could’ve saved me some bucks,” the 24-year-old pitcher said. Paré returned his attention to the camera, a few ideas in mind for new videos, and Connolly approached the pantry. The door again fell off the track, and Connolly slammed it. “This whole place is a joke,” he said, and all Paré could do was laugh. Waiting for the phone to ring Paré was living rent-free in a cousin’s spare bedroom last fall when the email arrived: “The purpose of this Notice,” it read, “is to inform you of the existence of a collective action lawsuit against Major League Baseball.” A group of former minor leaguers had formed a movement against the league, and hundreds more were adding their names. He thought about it and talked to people he trusted. He read articles about the attorney who had once played for the same organization now leading a charge against MLB. Paré wondered if, like the 1968 uprising that ultimately led to free agency, a victory here would be good for the game. And in the end, he couldn’t be certain it would. He believed the Giants (who through a spokeswoman declined to comment for this article) and MLB had, all told, been good to him. Around 2,300 current and former players would opt-in on the suit, but Paré would not be one of them. He didn’t want to take a side. He reported for spring training last February, reconnecting with Sonabend and Connolly, who also received the email but refused to add their names. “If I signed it,” Connolly said, “it would almost be like me not appreciating the opportunity.” Sonabend saw it similarly. “I knew what I was getting into,” he said, “and I worked for it anyway.” Last month, a California magistrate judge stripped the suit of its conditional class-action status. A setback, Broshuis admitted, but earlier this month the same judge granted a request to reconsider the class certification; a hearing is scheduled for Dec. 2. For now, Broshuis and the 41 co-plaintiffs wait, and for different reasons so do the young men in the apartment in west Augusta: Paré increasingly realistic about his baseball fate, Sonabend seeing how a former baseball castaway can climb, Connolly defiantly hopeful that the phone will someday ring, a voice on the other end inviting him to a higher level in the game and a better lifestyle. “It’s only going to be a couple years and you filter out,” Connolly said, “or you get that paycheck everybody dreams about.” Early on a Saturday afternoon, another game a few hours away, Paré dressed for work. Sonabend joined him in the den, and they collected their bags. “Is Mike pitching?” Paré asked. “Who’s pitching?” Sonabend shrugged. “Ready?” he said. “I’m ready,” Paré said, and they walked into the midsummer sun, through a door that didn’t want to close.

Reuben Long Detention Center) CONWAY, SC (WMBF) – A man was taken to the hospital after a drug deal went wrong in Conway Wednesday. According to a police report, Matthew Zinner was charged with attempted murder for shooting a man in the Walmart parking lot at 151 Middle Ridge Avenue. It started when Zinner sold the man an unknown amount of marijuana in his car. The victim paid with two counterfeit 100 dollar bills and walked away. Zinner got out of the car, chased after him with a handgun, and fired two shots. Officers with the Horry County Police Department who responded to Walmart after receiving reports of shots fired found found shoes and a hat at the scene, but no shell casings. Officers located the victim, who claimed the shoes and hat, at a local hospital with a gunshot wound to the right leg. Copyright 2016 WMBF News.

The man was pronounced dead at the scene. Vancouver police closed Mill Plain westbound between Interstate 205 and Southeast 105th Avenue for several hours as they investigated what happened. A motorist called 911 shortly before 4 a.m. to say he was driving west in the 10500 block of Mill Plain when he hit a dark object lying in the roadway, according to a press release from the Vancouver Police Department. He pulled over into the parking lot of a quick-lube store and realized he had hit a body. Police responded and recovered the body of a man, later identified as Fabian G. Rosales, 37, of Vancouver. According to preliminary reports, he was wearing dark clothing. It was also not immediately known whether the man died as a result of being struck and dragged by the vehicle, or whether he might have already been dead. The victim’s body will be taken to the Clark County Medical Examiner’s Office. The driver remained on the scene and cooperated with police. Speed or impairment are not factors in the crash, the press release said. Mill Plain was fully reopened by 9:30 a.m. The Vancouver Police Department’s Traffic Unit is investigating.   Craig Brown Columbian Metro Editor  360-735-4514  @col_cops  Send an Email   Jessica Prokop Columbian Courts Reporter  360-735-4551  @jprokop16  Send an Email Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

The dollar is losing some ground despite hopes among some quarters that the Chair will signal additional rate hikes in the near future. Among domestic data, second quarter GDP growth was revised down slightly in line with estimates. Advance estimate showed that the goods trade deficit for July was narrower than expected. With most recent data points reflecting strengthening economic momentum, Yellen may have to walk a tight rope in interpreting the course of monetary policy for the markets.   U.S. stocks fell again on Thursday, as traders preferred to wait for Yellen's speech amid the release of some strong domestic data and a rebound by oil.    The major averages opened lower but recovered in early trading and hovered mostly above the unchanged line till late afternoon trading. The averages subsequently slipped back into the red and languished below the unchanged line thereafter, ending modestly lower for the session.    The Dow Industrials fell 33.07 points or 0.18 percent before ending at 18,448, the S&P 500 Index ended down 2.97 points or 0.14 percent at 2,173 and the Nasdaq Composite closed at 5,212, down 5.49 points or 0.11 percent.    Nineteen of the thirty Dow components ended lower, while eleven stocks advanced. UnitedHealth (UNH), Nike (NKE) and Wal-Mart (WMT) were among the worst decliners of the session.    Among the sectors, biotechnology stocks came under selling pressure yet again, but gold stocks regained ground.    On the economic front, durable goods orders climbed 4.4 percent month-over-month in July following a revised 4.2 percent drop in June. Annually, durable goods orders fell 3.3 percent. Excluding transportation, orders rose a better than expected 1.5 percent month-over-month. Core capital goods orders were up 1.6 percent. However, shipments of this category of goods, which are directly plugged into GDP calculations, were down 0.4 percent.    The Labor Department reported that jobless claims edged down to 261,000 in the week ended August 20th from an unrevised 262,000 for the previous week. Economists expected a reading of 265,000 for the week.    The four-week average slipped to 264,000 from 265,250. Continuing claims calculated with a week's lag fell by 30,000 to 2.145 million in the week ended August 13th.    Currency, Commodity Markets   Crude oil futures for October delivery are slipping $0.03 to $47.30 a barrel after climbing $0.56 to $47.33 a barrel on Thursday. Gold futures are currently trading at $1,330.70 an ounce, up $6.10 from the previous session's close of $1,324.60 an ounce. On Thursday, gold fell $5.10.  On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 100.27 yen compared to the 100.53 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1301 compared to yesterday's $1.1285.   Asia   The lackluster mood continued in Asia, as traders were biding their time ahead of Yellen's speech. The Australian, Indian, Indonesian, Japanese, New Zealand, Singaporean and South Korean markets retreated, while the Taiwanese, Malaysian, Chinese and Hong Kong markets ended higher.    The Japanese market fell, as the yen firmed up in the Asian session. The Nikkei 225 Index opened lower and languished below the unchanged line throughout the session before ending down 195.24 points or 1.18 percent at 16,361, the lowest level since August 5, 2016.    Export, housing, pharma, real estate, retail, financial, insurance and utility stocks all saw weakness. On the other hand, beverage, cement, steel and some mining and chemical stocks gained ground.  Australia's All Ordinaries Index spent the better part of the session below the unchanged line, ending near the lows of the session. At the close of trading, the index was down 24 points or 0.43 percent at 5,607.    Energy, financial, industrial and real estate stocks fell steeply, but consumer staple, telecom and utility stocks advanced in the session.    Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended at 22,910, up 94.59 points or 0.41 percent, and China's Shanghai Composite Index closed at 3,070, up 1.98 points or 0.06 percent.    On the economic front, a report released by Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications showed that annual consumer price inflation in Japan came in at -0.4 percent in July, in line with estimates and unchanged from the level in June. This marks the fifth straight month of declines. Core CPI inflation was at -0.5 percent compared to expectations of 0.4 percent.   Europe   European stocks are trading mixed amid some volatility, as traders await Yellen's speech later in the day.  The U.K. Market is seeing a small bounce upward, with positive domestic GDP data supporting sentiment, while the rest of the major markets are modestly lower   On the economic front, the results of a survey by the GfK Institute showed that German consumer confidence is set to improve in September. The forward-looking consumer climate indicator rose to 10.2 from 10 in August. The indexes measuring income expectations and the propensity to buy, which pertain to August, firmed up, while the economic expectations index fell.    The second estimate released by French statistical office INSEE showed that the French economy stagnated in the second quarter, as initially estimated. GDP remained unchanged following the 0.7 percent growth in the first quarter. Household consumption and investment were weak.    U.S. Economic Reports   U.S. economic activity in the second quarter grew by slightly less than initially estimated, according to a report released by the Commerce Department. The report said gross domestic product increased by 1.1 percent in the second quarter, reflecting a downward revision compared to the originally reported 1.2 percent growth. The revision matched economist estimates. The downwardly revised GDP growth in the second quarter still reflects an acceleration from the 0.8 percent increase seen in the first quarter.   The advance report on trade in goods showed narrowing of the trade deficit to $59.3 billion in July from $63.3 billion in June, while the consensus estimate called for a deficit of $63.2 billion.    The University of Michigan is set to release the final estimate of its U.S. consumer sentiment for August at 10 am ET. Economists expect the index to be upwardly revised to 90.7 from 90.4 in July.     Yellen is scheduled to deliver a speech entitled "Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future" at the Kansas City Fed's monetary policy symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, at 10 am ET.    Stocks in Focus   Autodesk (ADSK) reported better than expected second quarter results and raised its full year guidance.    Brocade Communications (BRCD) also reported above-consensus third quarter adjusted earnings per share and revenues.    GameStop (GME) reported in line second quarter adjusted earnings per share, while its revenue trailed estimates. The company's third quarter earnings per share guidance was positive. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com America's 10 Best Places To Work New Year, New Hopes After Economy Chugged Along – Economic Preview for Week of January 3 10 Richest Presidents Before Donald Trump Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Starbucks Serves Up Gourmet Egg Bites Apple CEO Tim Cook Takes Pay Cut After Lackluster 2016 New York City Subways Will Get Cell Phone Signal Next Week America's 10 Best Places To Work -- Does Your Company Make The List?

TV MOVIES TOP TENS MUSIC LIFESTYLE FLASH GAMES Review of Jeff Foxworthy and Larry the Cable Guy: We’ve Been Thinking on Netflix 26th August 2016 by April Neale Jeff Foxworthy and Larry the Cable Guy: We’ve Been Thinking is perfect — for their core audience Jeff Foxworthy and Larry the Cable Guy are unapologetically Southern, American, and lowest denominator straight-shooters in the comedy world. Not sarcastic, certainly not rapid-fire loquacious nor veiled in pretention or sophistication. No, sir. They are the fried funnel cake of mirth, the corn dogs of comedy and they do not disappoint their core audience in their mini-reunion of sorts. Netflix brings a comedy special long awaited by the fans of the Blue Collar Comedy tour. Without their Blue Collar peers Ron White (on Showtime’s Roadies) and Bill Engvall, Foxworthy and Larry (Dan Whitney) are showing their age as they cover the usual suspects: Common sense long gone in the USA, the political scene, dog poop police, and “the war on women”. “I think God created women to guide men through life, but God knew men were hard-headed so he gave women the other stuff so that men will pay attention,” lectures Foxworthy as he riffs on how women always seem to have the upper hand. “If God had put women in a flannel nightgown we might all be livin’ in paradise today!” Foxworthy works in a progression of feigned outrage and saves his ire for personal injury lawyers, “trophies for everybody,” reality TV, old people’s email skills, breast reduction surgeries (“take an Advil!”), out-of-control parents at sporting events, and for the winners and losers of life? Foxworthy quips: “Walmart after midnight makes the Walking Dead look like America’s Top Model.” His middle-aged years eats a big chunk of his act as he goes on a jag about passing a huge kidney stone, the pain that it caused and how he found out about his and the prescribed course of action. “The pain was nuts,” says Foxworthy who then asks the women in the audience about their birth pain stories. “When that thing started moving I was eating Percocet like peanut M&Ms,” he adds as he describes the large stone moving around. “Fact of life” is a new angle that Foxworthy uses to bring home some observations. Flying on an airplane “makes you gassy”, or the vexing physics of eating Captain Crunch cereal. Count on loads of men vs women comparisons like being on time versus your wife having her hair just right, or women’s love of asking questions or when they wind up “sleeping like a hibernating bear” if too tipsy. How his listening to black women running commentary at the movies bit goes over in this titsy PC world remains to be seen. And then there’s Larry. Click down the dial as the Prilosec spokesman seems a bit slower, saying: “This is my 27th year in the comedy business” — and it shows. Git-R-Done wordsmith relies heavily on this old chestnut to the point where he’s saying Git-R-done in mock accents from China and Nairobi. Energetically he never was a whip-fast comic, but he’s still butchering words and has boiled his act down to his molasses-slow Southern chitty-chat while holding on the mic stand as he rips on Zika “merskitters,” visitin’ “bad zoos with boring critters” and cracks jokes about water parks (“imagine all of WalMart in bathing suits”) and a “brown recluse” (not the spider but his Puerto Rican neighbor), as well as big-headed lookalikes — and he gets as angry as a “fat guy with short arms in a porta-pottie trying to wipe his ass crack.” Golden Corral and Arby’s, of course, get a shout out as he riffs on sneeze guards and the cuisine while extolling the virtues of visiting and performing for the elder population of Branson, Missouri: “I made an old woman laugh so hard Milk of Magnesia came out her nose.” The act winds between his military camp visits, weight gain and, of course, Vegas observations that include Slim Jim wrappers mistakenly used as a condom, endless poop and topless craps tables jokes. He saves his fire for cell phones with which people take “nekkid” pictures of their private parts and inmates apparently shove up their rear ends, saying: “You think you have shitty reception?” The only thing missing from this performance was the drummer doing the requisite rolls after his groaners. Dadgum. Yeah. Jeff Foxworthy and Larry the Cable Guy: We’ve Been Thinking premieres Friday, August 26. Got something to say about this? Tell us in the comments!

Global retail majors Walmart and JCPenney are already investigating textiles sourced from Welspun India for product integrity, while IKEA is awaiting the outcome of a probe by the Indian firm in the wake of lapses in supplies. Welspun, which was supplying bedsheets and pillowcases made of Egyptian cotton to Target, was alleged by the US-based retailer for substituting another type of non-Egyptian cotton when producing sheets supplied between August 2014 and July 2016. Target has decided to terminate its contract with Welspun after an investigation. (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

However, since the Indian economy is now umbilically linked to its global counterparts, the articles that we come across have relevance for Indian stocks and the Indian economy. In that context, this report contains the ten most interesting pieces that we read this week.Here are the ten most interesting pieces that we read this week, ended August 26, 2016. 1) The seven immutable laws of investing [Source: GMO] The legendary James Montier of GMO is at his best in this insightful paper as he presents seven principles of sensible investing. Some of the most impactful principles highlight the importance of ‘margin of safety’ while investing and how the “this time is different “ approach is extremely dangerous.  He also shares his concerns around the current ‘artificially stimulated’ rally in global equities and bonds alike and believes cash is the best bet today! 2) Is greed good? No, it’s seriously bad for your wealth [Source: Financial Times] Greed is good” said Gordon Gekko in the famous 1980s movie, ‘Wall Street’. Now, fresh research, produced by State Street’s centre for applied research, suggests that greed is not good after all. In fact, avarice can be seriously bad for our wealth. The study uses State Street’s Investor Love for Money scale (ILOM), and found that the more someone had an emotional attachment to money, the more likely they were to make mistakes with money. The avaricious were more likely to buy at the top and sell at the bottom — which for investors is the cardinal sin, worse than all others. They also had shorter time horizons and were more inclined to hyperactive investing behaviour. Interestingly, the study also found that while Avarice is universal, it differs according to economic development with countries like India featuring in top of the list. 3) Alternative data firms are shedding new light on corporate performance [Source: The Economist] Given that financial statements are both infrequent and backwards-looking, getting a sense for how a business is performing in the present can be nearly impossible. This article highlights how to counter this, a cottage industry of a few dozen firms, mostly in America, is gleaning “alternative” data from novel sources - ranging from satellite images to obscure corners of social media. The growth of small, low-cost satellites and machine learning means companies can quickly and cheaply parse millions of satellite images a day. A common trick is to analyze photos of car parks outside big-box retailers such as Walmart to get a sense of daily revenues. A Chicago-based data firm, RS Metrics, sells estimates on the productivity of factories by tracking the number of lorries parked outside. 4) Centuries old sharks hold the secret to a longer life [Source: Financial Times] This piece highlights how a recent discovery of Greenland sharks that can live upto 400 years has started afresh the discussion on whether human lifespan could be extended dramatically. It discusses how human lifespan can be materially increased given that scientists found that mice could be engineered to live 35 per cent longer simply by clearing ageing cells from the body. 5) Robotics and virtual reality help heal spinal injuries [Source: Financial Times] This piece discusses how a clinical breakthrough, outlined in a US-Brazilian study published recently, shows how new technology combined with intensive long-term training could help patients paralysed by spinal cord injury to stimulate internal changes in their body and rehabilitate their nerves and muscles. One of the patients in the study, who had been paralysed for 13 years, was able to move her legs on her own after 13 months of training. The researchers use a “brain-machine interface” linked to various devices, including a virtual reality system that enabled paraplegics to simulate control of their paralysed legs. 6) The economics of marriage [Source: LiveMint] This article dives into the argument that people marry because it makes economic sense. It was in 1970s that this idea originated when Nobel Prize-winning economist Gary Becker first postulated an economic model of marriage, arguing that marriage was based on the principle of division of labour, and that gains from marriage were determined by how efficient this division was. The Beckerian model also said that in a marriage the one with comparative advantage at earning wages will go out and work; the other person has to do the dishes and probably stay at home. The article goes on to discuss some of the presumptions in the model and how the research in recent times has put these to test. 7) Office workers can learn from the Olympians [Source: Financial Times] As per this piece if there is one thing that distinguishes the Olympians from the average worker carrying out daily tasks it is this: practice. For athletes, training seems to make up 99 per cent of their existence against the 1 per cent of time spent competing in events that the public get to see. For most office workers, by contrast, a little training is quite enough and a “ferocious” desire to do more would be considered distinctly odd. It goes on to highlight that financial incentives are not so useful in encouraging people to complete the complex tasks of the modern workplace and that what really gives athletes the motivation to work so hard continues to remain a topic that needs to be researched further. 8) Indians spurn snacks, shampoo to load their smartphones [Source: WSJ] Consumer-goods companies in India are not thrilled with the country’s smartphone revolution. Now that their poorest customers have started spending on smartphone data, they have fewer pennies left over for snacks, sodas and shampoo. According to local mom and shop owners, kids have switched from spending their pocket money on chips and chocolates to data recharge. However, these companies have found ways to cope with this effect. Godrej Consumer Products has this year begun giving consumers beauty and hair-colouring tips on prerecorded mobile calls. In return, it said, consumers who answered and listened to these calls the most would stand a chance to win a free smartphone. HUL has invented a free mobile radio station that that lets callers dial in to hear popular Bollywood tracks. Breaks between songs are interspersed with ads for Lux soap and Brooke Bond tea, among other Unilever products. 9) An Indian state may be on the brink of recession because of the Gulf oil crisis  [Source: qz.com] As per this piece, the global oil slump is wreaking havoc in Kerala. This southern Indian state has built an enviable record of human development indicators thanks to decades of abundant remittances from the oil-rich Arabian Gulf. Now these remittances, which form 36% of Kerala’s net domestic product, are drying up. According to Kerala’s finance minister Thomas Isaac there’s “going to be a very serious regional recession” in this state of over 33 million people. 10) What drives Team GB’s medal machine? [Source: Spectator.co.uk] Writing a story about the once prevalent sporting culture in Great Britain, the author talks about how rather than a lack of ‘winning mentality’ in Britain, the reason for bad performance at international sporting events like Olympics was lack of a winning system: too much of British sport was a gentlemanly muddle. As a way to turn things around, UK Sport didn’t just look for decent athletes and back them. It also looked for sports in which Britain had a serious chance of winning a medal - sports that would fall to a full-scale assault of money and talent. It wasn’t about funding individuals and teams to fulfill their potential, it wasn’t about the pure quest for excellence and it had nothing to do with idealism. It was about medals. - Saurabh Mukherjea is CEO (Institutional Equities) and Prashant Mittal is Analyst (Strategy and Derivatives) at Ambit Capital Pvt Ltd. Views expressed are personal.

While the weather outside may be getting just that little bit too hot for most people’s tastes, the one thing we can’t forget about this past week is that video games are back. We’ve made it all the way over the mountain that was No Man’s Sky, finally gotten our hands on Deus Ex: Mankind Divided and are looking ahead to all the awesome stuff that awaits us in the rest of the year. Oh, and Madden is out, I guess. That’s a thing. As we say every week, Jelly Deals is constantly scouring the internet for deals and good prices, like one of those Mad Max type scavenger types from the Fallout games. Every week, I’ll visit to bring them directly to you and see if you fancy any of them. If you do, great! If not, no problem. As always, we do our best to make sure that these deals are all active and in stock when we post, but internet deals are fickle and have a bad habit of disappearing without warning. Essentially, the quicker you click, the better. Anyway, let’s get on with this thing. Here are some of this week’s best deals, starting with the US Deals and heading over to the UK lower down the page. US Deals The new release this week that had the least cybernetic augmentations (although I’d hesitate to say it has none) was Madden 17. From most reports, this year’s installment of EA’s gridiron football sports game is a surprisingly enjoyable entry into the franchise. Even better is that right now, you can pick up a PS4 copy of the (normally $60) game for $47.99 over on eBay. Sadly, no such deal for Xbox One owners on this one. Madden 17 on PS4 for $47.99 from eBay id Software’s 2016 update of their legendary DOOM franchise is definitely one to check out. That just got a little bit easier to do if you’re a console owner since GameStop US started offering Xbox One and PS4 copies for just $19.99 for a limited time. No word on how long this offer is around for, or how much stock is available, but you can ‘Click and Collect’ the game via their website to reserve a copy. DOOM on PS4 for $19.99 from GameStop US DOOM on Xbox One for $19.99 from GameStop US Look, if you own a PS4 and don’t have a copy of The Last of Us Remastered, where have you been? This game is so much of a must-have for PlayStation owners that I’m surprised it isn’t just being handed out with each and every PS4 sold. Until the day that eventually happens, here’s the next best thing – Walmart is selling copies for $12.95 right now. The Last of Us Remastered for $12.95 from Walmart If you’ve been on YouTube anytime since being alive, you’ve probably seen one of these microphones. They’re the Yeti USB mics from Blue and they’ve become a gold standard for YouTubers and streamers in recent years. For a reason – they’re good, very good in fact. Currently, Dell is offering up the best offer we’ve seen for one of these – price reduced down to $109.99 with a $40 Dell eGift voucher added in for good measure. Blue Yeti (Blackout) for $109.99 with $40 eGift voucher from Dell Logitech are no strangers to making PC peripherals, they’ve been making high-end PC gear for a while now. The trouble with high-end PC gear is that it usually carries a high-end price tag as well. Not so, at least right now, for this G430 7.1 headset, which is half price right now over on eBay, making the total cost $39.99 for the time being. Logitech G430 7.1 Gaming Headset for $39.99 from eBay UK Deals While we’re talking about games to look forward to this year, Mafia 3 is one of the bigger titles headed our way in October. It’s a game that’s on the minds of more than a few people, for a variety of reasons. While we will have to wait until closer to launch before we can tell how the game plays, if you’re someone who is absolutely set on picking this one up, you should be aware that you can pre-order a Steam version of the game from GamesPlanet right now for £27.99. That’s the cheapest way to pick the game up that we’ve seen so far and keys will be sent out shortly before launch. Obviously, you can also opt to wait and see, instead. Mafia 3 on PC (Steam) for £27.99 from GamesPlanet Overwatch was released back in May and is still one of the most played games of the year so far. Due to that, it’s also rarely, if ever, seen a price cut or discount since launch. Fortunately, that’s changed over at Amazon, albeit not by THAT much. You can pick up an Xbox One or PS4 copy of Overwatch for £32 right now, which is the cheapest it’s ever been so far. That’s also the Origins Edition of the game, so you’ll get your Noire Widowmaker skin as a nice bonus. Overwatch on PS4 for £32 from Amazon UK Overwatch on Xbox One for £32 from Amazon UK The folks over at Base.com are offering a few of Nintendo’s best Wii U titles (and part of Nintendo’s own ‘Selects’ range) for the extra low price of £16.85. Sure, the Nintendo Selects range are designed to be sold at a cheaper price, but it’s always nice to save an extra few pound along the way. Super Mario 3D World for £16.85 from Base.com Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker for £16.85 from Base.com Pikmin 3 for £16.85  from Base.com XCOM Enemy Unknown has been out for a few years now but still, stands tall as one of the best turn-based strategy games of the past decade or so. Some would even say that this game is greater than XCOM 2, in terms of replayability. If you haven’t yet added a PC copy of this to your collection, now’s your chance, since GamesPlanet is selling ‘The Complete Edition’ of the game for £5.99 right now, which is around £19 cheaper than buying it from Steam right now/ XCOM: Enemy Unknown – The Complete Edition for £5.99 from GamesPlanet Sony is currently hosting a sale on ‘Retro’ games on the PlayStation Store, featuring some of the PlayStation’s most loved classics for a few pounds each. This ‘Retro’ sale, which successfully making me feel incredibly old, also means you can get a bunch of the old Metal Gear Solid games for under £4 each. That is, as long as you have a PS Vita or PS3 to play them on, since these are the polished up HD versions of these games and for some baffling reason, you still can’t play any of these on a PS4. Fingers crossed for that one. Metal Gear Solid for PS3, PS Vita or PSP for £3.29 from PlayStation Store Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty for PS Vita for £3.99 from PlayStation Store Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty for PS3 for £3.99 from PlayStation Store Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater for PS Vita for £3.99 from PlayStation Store Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater for PS3 for £3.99 from PlayStation Store Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker for PS Vita and PSP for £3.29 from PlayStation Store Metal Gear Solid: Peace walker for PS3 for £3.99 from PlayStation Store It’s worth noting that, for some reason, they are selling the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection (which contains MGS2 and MGS3) for £9.49, making it more expensive than buying the two separately. So don’t buy that one. You can check out the rest of the PlayStation ‘Retro’ sale over here. PlayStation Store ‘Retro’ Sale Now here’s a weird one. This little SNES replica is actually a fully working Bluetooth controller, able to be used on PC, Mac, iOS, and Android. This makes this little guy ideal for playing games on a phone or tablet, sure, but really comes into its own when connected to a computer. While we’re obviously not saying you could use this controller with a SNES emulator and have yourself a fantastic time, but…you totally could. 8BitDo SFC30 (JPN/EU Colours) for £25.49 from Amazon UK 8BitDo SFC30 (US Colours) for £25.49 from Amazon UK That’s it, all done for one more week. As usual, please keep in mind that deals, prices, and availability can change at any time, so sorry if that happens on any of the above. I’ll be over at Jelly Deals, scouring the information super-highway for more deals, but feel free to drop us a like on Facebook or follow us on Twitter.

The US retail giant has begun sampling sheets manufactured by Trident, according to the people, who asked not to be identified as the talks are confidential. Trident, based in the northern state of Punjab, currently supplies terry towels to Target and is one of the few Indian companies with the capacity to produce more bedsheets, they said. "We have previously shared that we were actively working with existing vendors on our matrix to determine where we move the business. Trident is one of our current vendors," said Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder. "It would be premature to speculate on how we will plan for, and distribute, our business." Trident shares surged as much as 19 per cent, the biggest jump in more than a year, and traded at Rs 58.55 as of 12:58 pm in Mumbai. A Trident representative declined to comment. Welspun, which said on Friday it's working with Ernst & Young LLP to review its supply chain, dropped for a fifth consecutive day. The stock is down 49 per cent this week and has seen $750 million of its market value wiped out. Target on Aug. 19 severed business ties with India's largest home textiles exporter after discovering that sheets and pillows labeled as premium Egyptian cotton were actually made with another type of cotton. The retailer pulled the items from its stores and offered customers refunds. Other Welspun clients, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and J.C. Penney Co., said they are reviewing Welspun's product claims and certification records. Trident, with a market value of more than $430 million following today's surge, plans to make a big push into bed and bath linens and estimates they will comprise about 80 per cent of its textiles revenue in two years, according to its most recent annual report. The company shares many of Welspun's customers, including including Target, Wal-Mart, J.C. Penney and Macy's Inc., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. "There is a good chance that Trident may step into Welspun's shoes," said Arun Kejriwal, a director at Kejriwal Research & Investment Pvt. in Mumbai. "This is even more so as new capacity set up by Trident is yet to be fully utilized. They are currently operating under 50 per cent. They can ramp up quickly." Welspun's business with Target totaled $90 million and the mislabeled products constituted 10 per cent of that revenue, Managing Director Rajesh Mandawewala told analysts on Monday. Indian manufacturers have a 47 per cent share of the worldwide bedsheets market, and they have an 8 per cent cost advantage over Chinese suppliers, he said last August.

The scrip, after a positive opening, gained 6.25% to Rs 57.80 on BSE. On NSE, shares of the company went up by 6.75% to Rs 57.70. In the last four days, the company's scrip has declined by over 47%, wiping out Rs 4,867.3 crore from its market valuation. US-based retail chain Bed Bath & Beyond is conducting third party audit of items sourced from Welspun India, joining the likes of Walmart and JCPenny following lapses in supplies by the Gujarat-based firm to the US-based Target. Welspun India Managing Director Rajesh Mandawewala on Thursday told analysts in a conference call that the firm is in the process of appointing an external independent 'Big Four Auditor' to audit all of its supply systems and processes to understand the root cause. Global retail majors Walmart and JCPenney are already investigating textiles sourced from Welspun India for product integrity, while IKEA is awaiting the outcome of a probe by the Indian firm in the wake of lapses in supplies. Welspun, which was supplying bedsheets and pillowcases made of Egyptian cotton to Target, was alleged by the US-based retailer for substituting another type of non-Egyptian cotton when producing sheets supplied between August 2014 and July 2016. Target has decided to terminate its contract with Welspun after an investigation.

Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... This article first appeared in TomDispatch. At the federal courthouse, Ignacio Sarabia asks the magistrate judge, Jacqueline Rateau, if he can explain why he crossed the international boundary between the two countries without authorization. He has already pleaded guilty to the federal misdemeanor commonly known as “illegal entry” and is about to receive a prison sentence. On either side of him are eight men in the same predicament, all still sunburned, all in the same ripped, soiled clothes they were wearing when arrested in the Arizona desert by agents of the U.S. Border Patrol. Once again, the zero tolerance border enforcement program known as Operation Streamline has unfolded just as it always does here in Tucson, Arizona. Close to 60 people have already approached the judge in groups of seven or eight, their heads bowed submissively, their bodies weighed down by shackles and chains around wrists, waists, and ankles. The judge has handed out the requisite prison sentences in quick succession -- 180 days, 60 days, 90 days, 30 days. On and on it goes, day-in, day-out. Like so many meals served in fast-food restaurants, 750,000 prison sentences of this sort have been handed down since Operation Streamline was launched in 2005. This mass prosecution of undocumented border crossers has become so much the norm that one reportconcluded it is now a “driving force in mass incarceration” in the United States. Yet it is but a single program among many overseen by the massive U.S. border enforcement and incarceration regime that has developed during the last two decades, particularly in the post-9/11 era. Sarabia takes a half-step forward. “My infant is four months old,” he tells the judge in Spanish. The baby was, he assures her, born with a heart condition and is a U.S. citizen. They have no option but to operate. This is the reason, he says, that “I’m here before you.” He pauses. “I want to be with my child, who is in the United States.” It’s clear that Sarabia would like to gesture emphatically as he speaks, but that’s difficult, thanks to the shackles that constrain him. Rateau fills her coffee cup as she waits for his comments to be translated into English. Earlier in April 2016, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, still in the heat of his primary campaign, stated once again that he would build a massive concrete border wall towering 30 (or, depending on the moment, 55) feet high along the 2,000 mile U.S.-Mexican border. He would, he insisted, force Mexico to pay for the $8 billion to $10 billion barrier. Repeatedly throwing such red meat into the gaping jaws of nativism, he has over these last months also announced that he would create a major “deportation force,” repeatedly sworn that he would ban Muslims from entering the country (a position that he regularly revises), and most recently, that he would institute an “extreme vetting” process for foreign nationals arriving in the United States. In June 2015, when he rode a Trump Tower escalator into the presidential campaign, among his initial promises was the building of a “great” and “beautiful” wall on the border. (“And no one builds walls better than me, believe me. I will do it very inexpensively. I will have Mexico pay for that wall.”)  As he pulled that promise out of a hat with a magician’s flair, the actual history of the border disappeared. From then on in Election 2016, there was just empty desert and Donald Trump. Suddenly, there hadn’t been a bipartisan government effort over the last quarter-century to put in place an unprecedented array of walls, detection systems, and guards for that southern border. In those years, the number of Border Patrol agents had, in fact, quintupled from 4,000 to more than 21,000, while Customs and Border Protection became the largest federal law enforcement agency in the country with more than 60,000 agents. The annual budget for border and immigration enforcement went from $1.5 to $19.5 billion, a more than 12-fold increase. By 2016, federal government funding of border and immigration enforcement added up to $5 billion more than that for all other federal law enforcement agencies combined. Operation Streamline, a cornerstone program in the “Consequence Delivery System,” part of a broader Border Patrol deterrence strategy for stopping undocumented immigration, is just one part of a vast enforcement-incarceration-deportation machine. The program is as no-nonsense as its name suggests. It's not The Wall, but it embodies the logic of the wall: either you crossed “illegally” or you didn’t. It doesn’t matter why, or whether you lost your job, or if you’ve had to skip meals to feed your kids. It doesn’t matter if your house was flooded or the drought dried up your fields. It doesn’t matter if you’re running for your life from drug cartel gunmen or the very army and police forces that are supposed to protect you. This system was what Ignacio Sarabia faced a few months ago in a Tucson court.  His tragedy is one that plays out so many times daily a mere seven blocks from where I live. Before I tell you how the judge responded to his plea, it’s important to understand Sarabia’s journey, and that of so many thousands like him who end up in this federal courthouse day after day. As he pleads to be with his newborn son, his voice cracking with emotion, his story catches the already Trumpian-style of border enforcement -- both the pain and suffering it has caused, and the strategy and massive build-up behind it -- in ways that the campaign rhetoric of both parties and the reporting on it doesn’t. As reporters chase their tails attempting to explain Trump’s wild and often unfounded claims and declarations, the on-the-ground border reality goes unreported. Indeed, one of the greatest “secrets” of the 2016 election campaign (though it should be common knowledge) is that the border wall already exists.  It has for years and the fingerprints all over it aren't Donald Trump's but the Clintons', both Bill's and Hillary's. The Wall That Already Exists Twenty-one years before Trump’s wall-building promise (and seven years before the 9/11 attacks), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began to replace the chain link fence that separated Nogales, Sonora, in Mexico from Nogales, Arizona, in the United States with a wall built of rusty landing mats from the Vietnam and Persian Gulf wars. Although there had been various half-hearted attempts at building border walls throughout the twentieth century, this was the first true effort to build a barrier of what might now be called Trumpian magnitude. That rusty, towering wall snaked through the hills and canyons of northern Sonora and southern Arizona forever deranging a world that, given cross-border familial and community ties, then considered itself one. At the time, who could have known that the strategy the first wall embodied would still be the model for today’s massive system of exclusion. In 1994, the threat wasn’t “terrorism.” In part, the call for more hardened, militarized borders came in response, among other things, to a never-ending drug war.  It also came from U.S. officials who anticipated the displacement of millions of Mexicans after the implementation of the new North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which, ironically, was aimed at eliminating barriers to trade and investment across North America. And the expectations of those officials proved well justified. The ensuing upheavals in Mexico, as analyst Marco Antonio Velázquez Navarrete explained to me, were like the aftermath of a war or natural disaster. Small farmers couldn’t compete against highly subsidized U.S. agribusiness giants like Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland. Mexican small business owners were bankrupted by the likes of Walmart, Sam’s Club, and other corporate powers. Mining by foreign companies extended across vast swaths of Mexico, causing territorial conflicts and poisoning the land. The unprecedented and desperate migration that followed came up against what might be considered the other side of the Clinton doctrine of open trade: walls, increased border agents, increased patrolling, and new surveillance technologies meant to cut off traditional crossing spots in urban areas like El Paso, San Diego, Brownsville, and Nogales. “This administration has taken a strong stand to stiffen the protection of our borders,” President Bill Clinton said in 1996. “We are increasing border controls by fifty percent.” Over the next 20 years, that border apparatus would expand exponentially in terms of personnel, resources, and geographic reach, but the central strategy of the 1990s (labeled “Prevention Through Deterrence”) remained the same. The ever-increasing border policing and militarization funneled desperate migrants into remote locations like the Arizona desert where temperatures can soar to 120 degrees in the summer heat. The first U.S. border strategy memorandum in 1994 predicted the tragic future we now have. “Illegal entrants crossing through remote, uninhabited expanses of land and sea along the border can find themselves in mortal danger,” it stated. Twenty years later, more than 6,000 remains have been found in the desert borderlands of the United States. Hundreds of families continue to search for disappeared loved ones. The Colibri Center for Human Rights has records for more than 2,500 missing people last seen crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. In other words, that border has become a graveyard of bones and sadness. Despite all the attention given to the wall and the border this election season, neither the Trump nor Clinton campaigns have mentioned “Prevention Through Deterrence,” nor the subsequent border deaths. Not once. The same goes for the establishment media that can't stop talking about Trump’s wall. There has been little or no mention of what border groups have long called a “humanitarian crisis” of deaths that have increased five-fold over the last decade, thanks, in part, to a wall that already exists. (If the people dying were Canadians or Europeans, attention would, of course, be paid.) Although wall construction began during Bill Clinton’s administration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) built most of the approximately 700 miles of fencing after the Secure Fence Act of 2006 was passed. At the time, Senator Hillary Clinton voted in favor of that Republican-introduced bill, along with 26 other Democrats. "I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in,” she commented at one 2015 campaign event, "and I do think you have to control your borders." The 2006 wall-building project was expected to be so environmentally destructive that homeland security chief Michael Chertoff waived 37 environmental and cultural laws in the name of national security.  In this way, he allowed Border Patrol bulldozers to desecrate protected wilderness and sacred land. “Imagine a bulldozer parking in your family graveyard, turning up bones,” Chairman Ned Norris, Jr., of the Tohono O’odham Nation (a Native American tribe whose original land was cut in half by the U.S. border) toldCongress in 2008. “This is our reality.” With a price tag of, on average, $4 million a mile, these border walls, barriers, and fences have proven to be one of the costliest border infrastructure projects undertaken by the United States. For private border contractors, on the other hand, it’s the gift that just keeps on giving. In 2011, for example, the DHS granted Kellogg, Brown, and Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton, one of our “warrior corporations,” a $24.4 million upkeep contract. In Tucson in early August, Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence looked out over a sea of red “Make America Great Again” caps and t-shirts and said, “We will secure our border. Donald Trump will build that wall.”  He would be met with roaring applause, even though his statement made no sense at all. Should Trump actually win, how could he build something that already exists? Indeed, for all practical purposes, the “Great Wall” that Trump talks about may, by January 2017, be as antiquated as the Great Wall of China given the new high-tech surveillance methods now coming on the market.  These are being developed in a major way and on a regular basis by a booming border techno-surveillance industry. The twenty-first-century border is no longer just about walls; it’s about biometrics and drones. It’s about a “layered approach to national security,” given that, as former Border Patrol Chief Mike Fisher has put it, “the international boundary is no longer the first or last line of defense, but one of many.”  Hillary Clinton’s promise of “comprehensive immigration reform” -- to be introduced within 100 days of her entering the Oval Office -- is a much more reliable guide than Trump’s wall to our grim immigration future. If her bill follows the pattern of previous ones, as it surely will, an increasingly weaponized, privatized, high-tech, layered border regime, increasingly dangerous to future Ignacio Sarabias, will continue to be a priority of the federal government. On the surface, there are important differences between Clinton’s and Trump’s immigration platforms. Trump’s wildly xenophobic comments and declarations are well known, and Clinton claims that she will, among other things, fight for family unity for those forcibly separated by deportation and enact “humane” immigration enforcement.  Yet deep down, the policies of the two candidates are far more similar than they might at first appear. Navigating Donald Trump’s Borderlands Now That April day, only one bit of information about Ignacio Sarabia’s border crossing to reunite with his wife and newborn child was available at the Tucson federal courthouse. He had entered the United States “near Nogales.”  Most likely, he circumvented the wall first started during the Clinton administration, like most immigrants do, by making his way through the potentially treacherous canyons that surround that border town. If his experience was typical, he probably didn’t have enough water or food, and suffered some physical woe like large, painful blisters on his feet. Certainly, he wasn’t atypical in trying to reunite with loved ones. After all, more than 2.5 million people have been expelled from the country by the Obama administration, an average annual deportation rate of close to 400,000 people.  This was, by the way, only possible thanks to laws signed by Bill Clinton in 1996 and meant to burnish his legacy.  They vastly expanded the government’s deportation powers.   In 2013 alone, Immigration and Customs Enforcement carried out 72,000 deportations of parents who said that their children were U.S.-born. And many of them are likely to try to cross that dangerous southern border again to reunite with their families. The enforcement landscape Sarabia faced has changed drastically since that first wall was built in 1994. The post-9/11 border is now both a war zone and a showcase for corporate surveillance.  It represents, according to Border Patrol agent Felix Chavez,  an “unprecedented deployment of resources,” any of which could have led to Sarabia’s capture. It could have been one of the hundreds of remote video or mobile surveillance systems, or one of the more than 12,000 implanted motion sensors that set off alarms in hidden operational control rooms where agents stare into large monitors. It could have been the spy towers made by the Israeli company Elbit Systems that spotted him, or Predator B drones built by General Atomics, or VADER radar systems manufactured by the defense giant Northrup Grumman that, like so many similar technologies, have been transported from the battlefields of Afghanistan or Iraq to the U.S. border. If the comprehensive immigration reform that Hillary Clinton pledges to introduce as president is based on the already existing bipartisan Senate package, as has been indicated, then this corporate-enforcement landscape will be significantly bolstered and reinforced. There will be 19,000 more Border Patrol agents in roving patrols throughout “border enforcement jurisdictions” that extend up to 100 miles inland. More F-150 trucks and all-terrain vehicles will rumble through and, at times, tear up the desert. There will be more Blackhawk helicopters, flying low, their propellers dusting groups of scattering migrants, many of them already lost in the vast, parched desert. If such a package passes the next Congress, up to $46 billion could be slated to go into more of all of this, including funding for hundreds of miles of new walls. Corporate vendors are salivating at the thought of such a future and in a visible state of elation at homeland security tradeshows across the globe. The 2013 bill that passed in the Senate but failed in the House of Representatives also included a process of legalization for the millions of undocumented people living in the United States. It maintained programs that will grant legal residence for children who came to the United States at a young age and their parents. Odds are that a comprehensive reform bill in a Clinton presidency would be similar. Included in that bill was, of course, funding to bolster Operation Streamline. The Evo A. DeConcini Federal Courthouse in Tucson would then have the capacity to prosecute triple the number of people it deals with at present. After taking a sip from her coffee and listening to the translation of Ignacio Sarabia’s comments, the magistrate judge looks at him and says she’s sorry for his predicament. Personally, I’m mesmerized by his story as I sit on a wooden bench at the back of the court. I have a child the same age as his son. I can’t imagine his predicament.  Not once while he talks does it leave my mind that my child might even have the same birthday as his. The judge then looks directly at Sarabia and tells him that he can't just come here "illegally,” that he has to find a “legal way” (highly unlikely, given the criminal conviction that will now be on his record).  “Your son,” she says, “when he gets better, and his mother, can visit you where you are in Mexico.” “Otherwise,” she adds, he'll be “visiting you in prison” -- not exactly, she points out, an appealing scenario: seeing your father in a prison where he will be “locked away for a very long time.” She then sentences the nine men standing side by side in front of her for periods ranging from 60 days to 180 days for the crime of crossing an international border without proper documents. Sarabia receives a 60-day sentence. Next, armed guards from G4S -- the private contractor that once employed Omar Mateen (the Pulse nightclub killer) and has a lucrative quarter-billion-dollar border contract with Customs and Border Protection -- will transport each of the shackled prisoners to a Corrections Corporation of America private prison in Florence, Arizona. It is there that Sarabia will think about his child’s endangered heart from behind layers of coiled razor wire, while the corporation that runs the prison makes $124 per day for incarcerating him. Indeed, Donald Trump’s United States doesn’t await his presidency. It’s already laid out before us, and one place it’s happening every single day is in Tucson, only seven blocks from my house.

Photo by Jeremy Broadfield The City’s annual Back Pack Program is matching Chestermere families in financial need with gift cards and school supplies. “It’s to help the families in need, financial need, to start providing them with…financial help for school,” said Community Resource Worker Paulette Tippe. She said they have seen an increase in registration for the program. Last year, the city helped 33 families. This year 92 have registered. Work on the program started in May and lasts until the end of August. Donations of new back packs and school supplies were accepted, however Tippe says that gift cards to Wal-Mart and the General Store are the preferred donations. The gift cards are preferred by the program for several reasons. The cards allow families to maintain dignity and still experience the fun of back to school shopping. It also allows families to buy products and supplies that fit their specific needs. “A gift card allows a family and allows that student who’s super eager to go back to school to have that moment where they can choose their own supplies,” said Family and Community Services Coordinator Danielle Fermin. In following that theme of dignity and choice, families come into pick up their supplies and gift cards by appointment. Staff try to make the experience of selecting back packs and supplies as much like a shopping experience as possible. Anyone returning to school, whether it is grade school or post-secondary are eligible for the program. To be part of the program families needed to register with a community resource worker such as Tippe prior to Aug. 19. Families in need who missed the deadline should contact the Community Resource Centre as other programs and resources exist to help Chestermere residents.

You mentioned a way to find old military records with a caller on your national radio show. What was that website called? A: Archives.gov lets you request a family member’s service records and browse through photos captured during the war. It’s a great place if you’re researching family history or want to replace lost or damaged medals. Certain requests do require a $25 to $70 flat copying fee. Click here for direct links to order replacement metals and service records. Q: I have a slew of VHS tapes from the kid’s younger years. How can I get them into this century? A: Videotapes have a shelf life of only 10 to 12 years. As time passes, videotapes lose their magnetic signal. The sharpness, quality and color deteriorate. Worst of all, the tape grows brittle and breaks as it’s played. To preserve the content of your videotapes, digitizing them is a must. Here are your choices: Costco, Wal-Mart, and Walgreens will all transfer the old video formats to DVD. A Japanese company called Funai, the last company manufacturing VHS players, makes a device that transfers VHS content to DVDs. The device is inexpensive enough for home use and is available from a limited number of retailers, including my store. Click here to learn more about it now. Q: I keep getting calls from an insurance company trying to sell me a policy. They always call back even though I hang up on them. How can I stop them from calling? A: Telemarketers are tricky. If you hang up without specifically stating you’re not interested in what they’re selling, most companies will mark you down as “No answer.” So, they keep calling. Make sure your phone number is listed in the Do Not Call Registry. If you’re really fed up, block these calls altogether. Click here to see three apps that can block these calls or at least notify you that it’s a telemarketer on the other line. Q: Hi Kim! I’m visiting family next month and the airline recommends I arrive at the airport two to three hours before my flight departs. Is there any way to speed things up? A: The TSA recently introduced PreCheck to reduce wait times at security checkpoints. Visit TSA.gov/precheck to get started. You’ll need to set up an appointment to provide the TSA with documentation, fingerprints and have a background check completed. The process takes a few weeks while the Department of Homeland Security determines your security threat assessment, and it costs $85. However, once you’re cleared, your membership lasts five years and you’ll be able to breeze through the security checkpoints at the airport. With the extra time you’ll have on your hands, you might be tempted to browse the web while waiting for your flight. But before you log on, click here for tips on reducing your risk of being hacked when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks Q: I keep getting a prompt to update my iOS, but I’m planning on buying a new iPhone this fall. Should I even bother? A. Yes! The latest update to iOS 9.3.4 is really important, especially if you also missed the update to iOS 9.3.3 this summer. Version 9.3.3 fixed a vulnerability that was similar to Android Stagefright, which could allow a hacker to take control of your device by sending a corrupted text message. Version 9.3.4 makes the Pangu jailbreak tool useless and prevents other exploits that use the same software flaw to compromise your operating system. Updating your iOS is only the first step.
