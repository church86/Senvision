(NYSE:WMT) stock has a rating of 2.58 based on views of 19 brokerages. On this base scale, ‘1’ ranking is suggestion of investing in that particular stock.

Clinton conceded the presidency to Donald Trump in a phone call early Wednesday morning, a stunning end to a campaign that appeared poised right up until election day to make her the first woman elected U.S. president.(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) The definitive article explaining Donald Trump’s success was published two weeks ago in the Oct. 31, 2016, issue of The New Yorker. "The Unconnected: The Democrats lost the white working class. The Republicans exploited them. Can Hillary Clinton win them back?" The obvious and short answer is obvious: No. The longer answer is: She never tried. Election night I received a continuous stream of text messages from relatives and friends from coast to coast asking me “What’s happening?” “Why?” and the most poignant from our oldest daughter, 32-year-old Rachael, “Do Americans really hate women that much?” (No sweetie, just Hillary.) For 35 years, the Republican Party spun a narrative that the loss of jobs, good jobs, was the fault of Democratic regulation and taxes crippling the captains of industry. This tale of fantasy economics long discredited by a myriad of Democrats and some conservatives was never conveyed to working Americans, with the exception for a short duration by Bernie Sanders, and to a lesser degree by Elizabeth Warren, Nancy Pelosi and others who never had the national forum of Hillary Clinton. Clinton’s effort to embrace working Americans was short fused and undermined by her own attacks on Donald Trump’s insensitivities and the baggage she accumulated over 20 years. That said, the first successful, though not intentional, effort to sabotage the Hillary Clinton presidency was orchestrated by Bill Clinton when he embraced the George H.W. Bush NAFTA treaty and steamrolled his own party. For 35 years, the Republican Party spun its narrative, fooling the American workers and never being held accountable for its destruction of the American middle class as Democrats cavorted with Wall Street, bankers, and international financiers. For 25 years, the Democratic Party led by the Clintons sucked up to Walmart and Wall Street while claiming to defend the American workers. The Waltons might or might not have voted for Hillary, but rest assured Walmart workers and Walmart shoppers voted for Donald Trump. So did Kmart shoppers. Recall those standard questionnaires with a range of 10 spots from "extremely agree" at one end to "extremely disagree" at the other end and "neutral" in the middle. Now fashion it with "I care about my friends and neighbors" at one end and "I’ve been screwed over one too many times" at the other end. Screwed-over working America did not care that the Republican Party was mostly responsible for their plight, they did not care that the states with failed job growth strategies — like Wisconsin and Kansas — were run by Republican governors who screwed the poor and gave tax breaks to their buddies. Screwed-over Kansans and Wisconsinites, like the rest of America, saw each political party offer up a populist. The carefully orchestrated Democratic Party nominating system was rigged, polite, and stacked — and they rejected their populist, Bernie Sanders. The Republican Party's process was chaotic, impolite, and offensive — and they chose the clear, strong, angry voice: their populist, Donald Trump. The voters chose strident voice, not party. The consequences for the Democratic Party are a disaster. A majority of America did not care who created the mess — they wanted an alternative, they wanted revenge. As the campaign for president came to a close, there were tell-tale signs of the wheels coming off the Clinton campaign bus. There were too many undecideds, who in the end broke against the incumbent, against the establishment. And all those angry white males. Some of them were white men, others were brown and black men, and some were women. But there were too many angry genetic white males and the Clinton campaign ignored them. Then there was the failed media campaign. Two of the cardinal rules of politics were violated by Hillary Clinton, both lessons I learned 40 years ago in my first term in office. First, never attack the voters. No matter what you think of your opponents, do not call their base of supporters indecent, shameless, or deplorable. Secondly, never utter any opinion or position in private that you are not willing to say in public. If that was true in the 1970s it is more true today when everyone in the room has their own recording device. Having failed two rules, the Clinton campaign barreled forward to follow the third rule as the campaign concluded: Always play to your strength. The theme of the campaign was to continue to appeal to equity and social justice, the empathy of the American people. Donald Trump was a never-ending wealth of material for those who cared about their friends and neighbors. There was the attack on the disabled, the Mexicans and Latinos, and especially his crude direction to tell whoever was listening to “Go fuck themselves.” Rest assured none of Donald Trump’s friends ever wrote a book entitled anything like “It Takes a Village.” Those angry white males, those undecideds, that basket of deplorables wanted to read, “How to Get Yours and Screw Everyone in Authority.” Like this story?

If there is a surprise in all of this, it is that the Trump campaign did not double down and rerun the Hillary Clinton campaign's anti-Trump ads. In his New Yorker article, focusing on the divide between white working-class America and the rest of the nation, George Packer recounts: "When I asked her (Hillary Clinton) if this (educational elitism) had helped drive working-class Americans away from the Democratic Party, she hedged. 'I really don’t know the answer to that…'" How Clintonesque. She spent 20 years preparing to run for president. She took money from Wall Street while spinning them one story and her social justice colleagues another. She and Bill did amass a fortune and, when most politicians knew better, even set herself above the rest — not just the commoners but also the rest of the elites. There were the emails and then there were the foreign gifts to the Clinton Foundation while she was secretary of State. When she failed to answer Packer, once again she either lied or fudged. In either case, she was following in the tradition of every U.S. president over the past 35 years — fucking over working Americans. The difference is that whether it hubris, indifference, or arrogance, she did not have the filter to cover it up. Not when she answered Packer, not when she won the nomination, and not when she squared off against Donald Trump. It was obvious last spring that most Americans were mad as hell and there were two candidates who understood that. Bernie Sanders reflected and addressed it in a thoughtful, compassionate manner, not crying for blood, but demanding reasonable reforms. Donald Trump understood it and exploited and manipulated the long-suffering victims of both political parties. With Sanders out of the way, Hillary, who was too removed, too distant from the alienated, disenfranchised workers, sallied forth, offering platitudes and homilies but failing to give the people what they really wanted, the architects of the current economy. Trump never hesitated to sacrifice his bankers, his friends, and his investors. In meantime, none of us have a clue as to Trump’s real intentions on the economy. We know his stated positions on immigration and Supreme Court nominations but not much more. He may well create as much chaos for the Republican Party as he does for the Democrats, creating a very vulnerable GOP in 2018. The problem is Hillary Clinton smashed up the Democratic Party far worse than Lyndon Johnson and Hubert Humphrey could ever imagine. Paul Soglin is mayor of Madison.

This summer they stood together, attending a wedding only made possible by the extraordinary aftermath of the crime and the filming of a documentary about it. Sean Clifton chats with Julie Bouvier at his son's wedding this August.  (Patrick Doyle / For the Toronto Star)   By Alex BallingallNews Sat., Nov. 12, 2016 Sixteen years after Sean Clifton tried to kill Julie Bouvier, he sat fidgeting on a hotel room couch, waiting for her knock on the door. The hands that drove a knife six times into Julie’s body now pawed at a plastic water bottle. His mind, once clouded with schizophrenic delusions, now buzzed for the words to tell her he’s sorry. The almost-killer hunched forward in his best suit and tie, his face pinched into the wounded look he wears so often, with something timid, something bashful, behind his eyes. A sound boom hovered above his head, but Clifton didn’t seem to notice. He also wasn’t preoccupied with the tripod-mounted camera that was trained on his face. I observed from the kitchen, out of the shot, as Clifton looked at the man who directed the scene from a green plastic chair: an Emmy Award-winning documentarian named John Kastner. “You’re the boss,” Kastner told him. “Say whatever it is, from your heart.” Clifton, 48, blinked and said “OK” in a cadence that evoked Eeyore, the glum donkey from Winnie the Pooh. Article Continued Below Kastner smiled at him. “Not to worry,” his voice chimed. “Que sera, sera.” ▶ Sean Clifton talks about his nerves before meeting the woman he stabbed. It would be the climactic scene of Kastner’s second movie about Clifton. The first, 2013’s NCR: Not Criminally Responsible, centred on his random attack of Julie at a Walmart in Cornwall, Ont., in October 1999. Clifton was found “not criminally responsible” for the stabbing, because of mental illness, and was held at an institution in Brockville until 2008, when he was released under supervision in the community. Julie and her parents also featured prominently in the first movie; it showed how they managed to understand and forgive Clifton, and even came to support him in his recovery. But while her parents met Clifton during the first doc, it wasn’t until now — for the sequel — that Julie was ready to see him. He had yearned to say sorry since the early months of his treatment, when guilt first pierced the fog in his mind. On this sunny August afternoon in downtown Ottawa, as Julie approached and steeled herself to hear her stabber’s apology in front of Kastner’s cameras, Clifton finally had his chance to repent. It was the climax of the story, yes, but as Kastner breathlessly explained while I observed the making of the documentary this summer, there was so much more to tell. Primarily, there was Jon McMahon, who sat a couch cushion away from Clifton and cracked his second Heineken of the afternoon. He was responsible for the sequel’s title: Not Criminally Responsible: Wedding Secrets. One secret was that McMahon is Clifton’s long-lost son, a shaggy-haired 31-year-old who decided to meet his biological dad after he saw the first doc. Another was that the decision to reconnect spawned an unlikely romance for McMahon: he was now engaged to someone with an intimate connection to both docs, and they would get married in three weeks beneath a gnarled tree in an Ottawa park, with the Bouvier family in attendance alongside Clifton — one big, happy NCR family. But first Clifton had to apologize. You could say the sum of his whole life was with him in the hotel room that day: the suffering and illness that led to violence; his years of treatment to get better; his confusion at the good that somehow grew from his horrible deed. All of it hung above this moment when he could say sorry, be forgiven, and maybe even forgive himself. I heard Kastner gently repeat to Clifton, “From the heart.” And Clifton, like Eeyore: “From the heart.” Three knocks on the hotel room door. Documentary maker John Kastner, left, chats with Clifton at the wedding. Kastner began filiming his first doc about the case years ago and just wrapped up the unexpected sequel.   (Patrick Doyle/FOR THE TORONTO STAR)   There’s a bridge in Cornwall that spans the tumbling mass of the St. Lawrence River. Clifton’s mother, Sheila, went there once when he was a little boy, and threatened to jump. He wasn’t with her but remembers the story because she told him she wanted to die. Fireworks crackled in the sky outside the Ottawa hotel as Clifton told me this story, the night before he was slated to apologize to Julie. He wore a green and blue striped T-shirt tucked into jeans that hugged his portly frame, with socks and Birkenstocks, and mirrored aviators that covered his eyes. His goatee and ponytail made him look a bit like the Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons, but with no whiff of smugness or condescension. It was easy to forget this was a man that tried to kill a stranger. Clifton was born in Cornwall in 1968, the youngest of four brothers by about a decade. He said his mother was institutionalized for mental illness before he was born, but he didn’t learn that she stayed at the health centre in Brockville until Kastner’s associate producer, Nicole Rogers, dug up the information in her research for the film. His parents were very strict when he was a kid. “There was no acting mad,” he said. “It was just: yes sir, no sir, three bags full sir. And that’s the way it went with them until the day they died.” (Clifton said his parents died a year apart in the mid-1990s.) When he was 12, Clifton was sent to a children’s psych clinic in Kingston to be treated for depression. He stayed there five days a week over nine months. After the treatment was finished, when he was 13, Clifton’s parents enlisted him in the Army Cadets. He stood out for the meticulous care of his boots and uniform, but when he was sent to a leadership training course at the Canadian Forces base in Trenton, he flubbed the test that called for teaching younger cadets how to salute. He said he was too nervous to try. Later, in high school, Clifton met Dawne Mullin, a local girl who turned out to be the only girlfriend he’s ever had. She’s also the mother of Jon McMahon, who was born in 1985, when Clifton was 17. He can’t remember if he held his son back then, but he has an image in his mind of baby Jon-to-be sleeping in a crib behind the nursery’s glass window. He and Mullin decided it was best to give him up for adoption. “Just like Moses,” Clifton said, “just had to send him adrift for a while.” The next few years were the “high point” of Clifton’s life. He backpacked Europe and North Africa, taught English in Hong Kong, and enrolled in some college courses back in Cornwall. His big dream was to one day land a white-collar job. “How wonderful it would be,” he said, “to be leaning on a counter with a cup of coffee in my hand, having a normal conversation with somebody.” But he was his mother’s son. In Hong Kong, he found himself flirting with suicide on the subway platform. He even went up on the bridge in Cornwall, but just like Sheila, he didn’t jump. In time, Clifton said he was “crippled” by his mind. He developed tics and patterns that he needed to fulfil, a symptom of intensifying obsessive compulsive disorder. He couldn’t bear cracks in the sidewalk, and took to tiptoeing around town with his head bent forward, straight down like an ambling Quasimodo. And before leaving a room with a clock, he’d have to watch the second hand spin for several minutes. He was also convinced of a war, where the forces of his hometown conspired against him, and he stood alone on his own side of an unbreachable chasm. He called it “Cornwall versus Hippie.” Julie Bouvier was a 22-year-old pharmacy worker, engaged to be married, at the time of the stabbing.   (GEOFF GEORGE photo)   Julie’s father Andy Bouvier owned a furniture store on Cornwall’s Montreal Rd. back then. There were windows at the front, and Andy sometimes recognized Clifton for his distinctive gait as he passed outside. “He’d do the thing with his toes,” Andy said, recalling the careful way Clifton shuffled around. “He was known to everyone in town for walking like that.” On Thursday, Oct. 7, 1999, at the apex of his afflictions with depression, schizophrenia and obsessive compulsive disorder, Clifton committed the seminal act of his life. He tried to kill Julie Bouvier. Around dinnertime, after a failed attempt to check into hospital, Clifton sauntered into the town’s Walmart and shoplifted a knife. Kastner’s first documentary detailed how Clifton fixated on the need to attack “the prettiest girl” he could find. Julie pulled into the parking lot. She was 22, a pharmacy worker who was engaged and excited to start a family. Clifton charged her as she approached the storefront doors. Wild-eyed and shouting, he repeatedly plunged the knife into her body. The blade missed Julie’s frantic heart by half an inch. Another strike passed close to her spine. Clifton cried out as Julie fell — “Die, bitch!” according to one account printed in the Guardian — and then stood trancelike above her as she bled at the Walmart’s threshold. He didn’t move until police came to arrest him. The Bouviers got the call around 7 p.m. Julie’s parents arrived at the hospital as she was being wheeled into surgery. They leaned over the gurney and her mom, Noella, whispered in her ear. “Everything will be fine.” She couldn’t tell if Julie was conscious. It took months, but Julie recovered. The following July, she got married as planned, and later had three children, just like she wanted. But Clifton still stalked her memory, a spectre that haunted her parents, too. Months after the attack, Julie went to the court hearing that eventually ruled Clifton was “NCR” for trying to kill her. “I didn’t know how close he’d be,” she remembered. “I said I’d never step foot in a courtroom again.” From then on, Andy took it upon himself to keep tabs on Clifton, who was sent 100 kilometres up the St. Lawrence River to the Brockville Mental Health Centre. Even on the night of the attack, when Julie was at the hospital, Andy asked her fiancé to drive him to the Walmart. There was police tape and blood on the ground. “If I had gotten my hands on him that night,” Andy said, “I probably would have killed him.” While he was institutionalized, Clifton had to attend annual hearings before the Ontario Review Board, a panel that follows each NCR patient’s progress and condition, and decides whether to soften the rules of confinement or proceed with eventual release. Andy attended each of Clifton’s hearings. He remembers once when Clifton stood up and claimed he was being treated unfairly. Andy was sitting directly behind him, and noticed that his own hand was clenched in a white-knuckle fist. “I didn’t understand mental illness at the time,” he said. “I was there for the protection of my family and to make sure he didn’t get out.” The Bouviers were Catholic, but about eight years ago, while still anguished by the stabbing, Noella and Andy tried a church for born-again Christians. They took a course there called “New Beginnings.” When it was finished they took it again, and then encouraged Julie to come to the new church, which she did a few times. The family also started researching schizophrenia and other mental illnesses to try to understand Clifton. In time, as Noella and Andy grew with their new faith and Julie focused on her young family, the Bouviers relinquished some of the ill will toward Clifton. “It showed us how to confront our emotions,” Noella said of her research and religion. “And believe me,” she added, “we had bitterness, resentment, anger, total un-forgiveness toward Sean.” Clifton was released from the institution around this time and allowed to live in Brockville under close supervision. Staff from the centre made sure he took his daily mélange of anti-psychotics, anti-depressants and pills for blood pressure and epilepsy. As he gained further control over his delusions, tics and paralyzing need to follow patterns, he moved into a home with other outpatients. Sean Clifton and his son, Jon McMahon, wait for the arrival of Julie Bouvier while filming a documentary in Ottawa in August. Clifton stabbed Bouvier in a random attack In 1999.  (Patrick Doyle/FOR THE TORONTO STAR)   Three years later, in 2011, Andy caught wind that there was a filmmaker that wanted to make a movie that featured his daughter’s stabber. By then he had accepted that Clifton’s release was inevitable, but he wasn’t entirely comfortable with it. He was lobbying his local MP for a bill to make it illegal for NCR patients not to take their medication. Andy went to see Kastner in Brockville. They spoke for a long time, and by the end of their conversation, Andy had agreed to appear in the movie himself. He went home and spoke with Noella, who jumped on board, too. And by the time filming had started, Julie decided to take part. Kastner called it a “classic two-hander” — Clifton struggling to recover, and the Bouviers grabbling with their anger. He decided to make an entire movie about it, and through the process of filming with Kastner, Julie and her parents agreed to extend their forgiveness to Clifton, though Julie was still unable to meet him. When the movie came out in 2013, it garnered a lot of attention from mental health advocates, lawyers and the media, with interviews touching on the delicate balance between the urge to see a perpetrator punished and the need for people with mental illness to receive proper treatment. “He’s a man who’s ahead of his time,” Andy said of Kastner. “People who wouldn’t probably seek help for mental illness — today they would. And it’s thanks to people like John Kastner.” In the years since, Andy and Noella have become advocates for people with mental illness, and were happy to hear that Clifton received an absolute discharge from the Ontario Review Board last year, meaning he is no longer under supervision and lives on his own in Brockville. Andy was even appointed to the board last March, and now participates in shepherding NCR patients back into society as functioning, independent people. Julie, meanwhile, broke her vow never to set foot in a courtroom again. With the trauma of her attack softened by her blooming empathy for Clifton, she goes there every day: she works as a court reporter in Cornwall. Sean Clifton with his son Jon McMahon and Jon's wife, Nicole Rogers.  (Patrick Doyle/FOR THE TORONTO STAR)   The Summer Olympics flickered without sound on the television behind the camera operator’s back. Jon McMahon stared at the screen, like a man concussed, sharing the couch with Sean Clifton: father and son, side by side, grasping for things to say to the cameras in the minutes before Clifton would meet Julie and apologize. McMahon turned to his dad and asked how he felt. “It’s not coming easy,” Clifton stammered. “I’m just going to say sorry … How do you make small talk with somebody you tried to kill?” McMahon grinned and raised his Heineken. “Here’s to a stab-free life?” Laughter subsided, and one of the film crew yelled out a 10-minute warning. The Bouviers were almost here. During a break, McMahon stood up, withdrew a pack of smokes and went out to the hotel room balcony. I followed him and shut the sliding door as he sparked a lighter and took his first drag. “Sometimes the conversation doesn’t flow,” he said. “I’m always worried about, how’s my tone? How’s this going to sound?” We both looked back into the room, where Kastner gesticulated and the film crew prepared to watch McMahon’s biological father, a man he didn’t meet until he was almost 30, apologize to a woman for stabbing her six times. McMahon’s lips curled into a smirk. “It’s a little weird,” he said. Growing up in Chesterville, a small town south of Ottawa, McMahon always knew he was adopted. So was his big sister. It was just a fact in his head. He found out about Clifton in his early 20s, after his biological mother messaged him on Facebook. He said he felt no inclination to meet Clifton, though he did connect with his mother, Dawne Mullin. He was fearful of how his adoptive parents would react. And there was the stark reality that this guy, his father, tried to kill somebody. His biology took on a new, sinister hue. “I was obviously concerned. Scared I guess, right?” McMahon said. “I became hyper-vigilant of my own thoughts… Is it just going to take this one thing and then I’m just going to snap?” Years passed, and then he heard about Kastner’s movie. One night, he watched it online with a buddy. His father’s face, before just a smudge in his mind’s eye, crystallized into Clifton’s face. And the thrust of Kastner’s film, the sympathetic portrayal of Clifton’s guilt and efforts to stay medicated, stirred in McMahon the desire to meet his biological dad. He had no idea what was coming. That night, after the movie, he emailed Kastner and told him he was Clifton’s son. He said maybe he could help Julie’s lingering unease with Clifton by coming forward, to underscore his humanity, that this guy was once in love and had a child. He also asked if Kastner thought Clifton could handle a reunion. Kastner showed the email to his associate producer, Nicole Rogers. The vivacious and keenly organized filmmaker from small-town Alberta had worked with Kastner on several movies in Toronto, and he trusted her deeply. “The letter was so moving,” recalled Rogers, now 29. “We couldn’t help but thinking, who is this guy? He’s so thoughtful.” Kastner invited McMahon to come meet the Bouviers at a screening of the movie at the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Hospital on May 16, 2013. Rogers didn’t plan to go until she learned McMahon would be there. The letter had piqued her curiosity. She booked a train ticket at her own expense, found a room at a local hostel, and went straight to the screening. “His was the only back to me when I came in,” Rogers said. Then he turned around. In a note she later shared with Kastner, Rogers described seeing his blue eyes, just like Clifton’s, and his “sun-kissed wavy hair.” “Our eyes met,” she wrote, “and in those milliseconds I experienced the closest thing I can think of to describing love at first sight… This man I had just met, Jon McMahon, had come into my life like a ray of sunshine and I didn’t want to let go.” This wasn’t lost on McMahon. He felt the same grip when he met Rogers: he was immediately attracted to the young woman with blond hair who exudes warmth with an easy laugh and a ready smile. When McMahon told me the story of how he met Clifton for the first time, weeks later at a food court in Ottawa, it was like a footnote to his feelings for Rogers. He asked Clifton if she had a boyfriend. “I was enthralled,” McMahon said. “It was unlike any other experience I’ve had.” They started emailing and agreed to meet again. Then again. And again. Over time, she was able to help him understand his father, his illnesses and his dread and self-disgust with the knowledge of what he did. Rogers dropped her new life in Toronto’s documentary film world to move to Ottawa and be with McMahon, a part-time personal support worker who also goes to goes to university. Last spring, after they were engaged, McMahon and Rogers went for a bike ride. They pedalled into a lush park, and came upon a wooden bridge that crested a glassy stream dotted with lily pads and algae. On the other side of the bridge, a gnarled tree with a trunk like a golf cart stood on the muddy shore. Its thick limbs twisted in a leafy canopy above a clearing. This was where they would marry. But first there was a movie to shoot. This past August, in that hotel room in downtown Ottawa, Rogers stood in the kitchen, producer and film subject, with a microphone on her blouse and instructions from Kastner to bring snacks and champagne after Clifton apologized to Julie. A text message arrived. The Bouviers were downstairs. Kastner bounded across the room and said to McMahon, “They’re going to knock and you’re going to answer it. And don’t look at the camera! You’re going to answer it and que sera, sera!” Rogers whispered in the kitchen. “My heart’s pounding,” she said. “This is why I’m glad we’re doing this before the wedding!” Sean Clifton makes a toast with his son Jon McMahon, left, Jon's fiancee and documentary associate producer Nicole Rogers, second from left, Julie Bouvier, second from right, Julie's mother, Noella Bouvier, and Julie's father, Andy Bouvier, in Ottawa this summer.   (Patrick Doyle/FOR THE TORONTO STAR)   Three knocks on the hotel room door. Apprehension walloped around the suite as McMahon stood and strode to the hallway, a camera guy stutter-stepping in his wake. He pulled open the door and someone, I think Andy Bouvier, said: “Good to see you.” “Good to see you,” McMahon replied. I strained to listen, pen poised. Here they come … CUT! Kastner stopped the action and McMahon returned to the couch. John Westheuser, one of the principal camera operators, called through the door. “Count to 10, then knock!” A few seconds passed in silence. Three knocks on the hotel room door. Again. McMahon answered it and the greeting was repeated — “Good to see you.” “Good to see you, too.” The Bouviers entered, and Julie drifted toward the couch in a white blouse with an air of serenity. When I heard her speak, I wrote in my notebook: “sweetest, gentlest voice.” He didn’t hesitate. Clifton: Julie, there’s something I wanted to say for 16 years now, and that’s that I’m sorry for what I did to you that day in the Walmart parking lot. Julie: Tha-thank you very much for your apology. Clifton: I know I can’t make it all go away or make it like it never happened or anything like that. But I’m sorry. Julie: Sean, I know that I was there at the wrong place, the wrong time and you were very ill and I completely understand. And I’ve never held that against you. Clifton: Thank you. Julie: I’m very, very happy.” It took 66 seconds. Once the apology was out of the way, the intensity of the moment gave way to the warmth of a neighbourly, almost familial visit. McMahon chatted with Noella and Julie, Clifton and Andy talked about fishing bass near Cornwall, and Rogers waltzed in with tall glasses of champagne. Cameras rolled and Kastner smiled at the scene, soaking the moment. “Well,” Clifton said, “I’d like to make a toast. Here’s to Julie. May you live long and prosper.” Glasses clinked and Clifton, for the first time in his 48 years, took a sip of champagne. He told me later it was like an explosion in his mouth. It just went poof. Jon McMahon marries Nicole Rogers on Aug. 25, under a gnarled tree in Ottawa. Rogers was moved by the young man who emailed documentary maker John Kastner after watching his movie about his father.   (Patrick Doyle/FOR THE TORONTO STAR)   Elegant string music wafted from a speaker plugged into an iPad, as mosquitoes flitted in the August heat, landing on congregants in the clearing under the gnarly tree. Nicole Rogers floated across the wooden bridge and entered the clearing, radiant in a white dress with French braids in her hair. The crowd parted and she walked straight to McMahon, who stood under the canopy of branches and leaves, copiously perspiring in a grey, three-piece suit. Julie Bouvier stepped forward and snapped a photo on her phone. Andy and Noella were there, too, along with Kastner and his crew, documenting the denouement of their sequel. Before the ceremony, I drove to the park with Sean Clifton and a couple of the crew members. He said he could never imagine a day like this. “I never dared look this far in the future,” he said. “It wasn’t even a dream.” He stood at the back of the crowd in the clearing, somewhat stiff in his suit and aviators. Up at the altar, McMahon sweated and Rogers held his hands and they promised to love each other and share the journey of life together. ▶ Sean Clifton talks about his relationship with son Jon and his emotions looking back on how his life has changed. Later, there was a reception at a fashionable restaurant on Elgin St., where Kastner’s cameras crowded around a table near the window that had places for Clifton and the Bouviers. The newlyweds came over to chat with Andy and Noella, and Clifton stood up to hug his son. It was hard to hear what Clifton told him, but the microphone picked it up. “I love you.” Speeches were delivered, toasts were made and waves of laughter and happy conversation swelled through the room. In the midst of the action, Clifton poked at his food and stared at the tablecloth, his face blank — like he was alone in the togetherness. After dessert, Kastner brought him into a side room, where he sat in a chair beneath a stage light for a wedding night interview. When they were about to wrap up, Clifton woodenly declared he wanted to discuss “how all the people in that dining room are there because I violently attacked somebody.” Kastner, leaning forward, asked him to elaborate. “John, honestly — I don’t see much positive that came out of this disaster. I almost murdered somebody, and maybe we’d be better off if I hadn’t done it,” he said. “I’m sure we would be better off.” “But the fact is,” Kastner offered, “there would be no marriage tonight …” Clifton bristled. “Well,” he said, “I can’t really excuse myself because my son found a nice wife and some things have gone right.” The director was taken aback. After a few seconds, he said “cut” and Clifton left without fanfare in a cab to his hotel. Kastner said he’d never heard him talk with such pessimism about the wedding. He’d been proud and upbeat in other interviews. Everyone clearly wanted a happy ending, Kastner maybe most of all. But the only one to expressly deny it that night was Sean Clifton. He looked around the room, at his son and Rogers and the Bouviers, and he saw a tragedy narrowly averted. In his moment of redemption, was there really any closure at all? Earlier that day, I asked him about this; whether good that unfurls from the consequences of a horrible act can make it less bad. “I don’t know,” Clifton replied. “I’ll probably think about that for a long time.” Then his eyes softened and took on that wounded look. “I don’t think it does,” he said.

On eBay prices of the NES Classic are going crazy, some listing ask $13,000 for the $59.99 NES. I assume these sellers hope that Kanye West just absolutely wants a NES Classic now. The lowest offers are around $300 on ebay.com. These outragous prices might be the reason Amazon does not allow NES resellers yet on its marketplace. How to Buy Pokemon Go Plus The Pokemon Go Plus is the most frustrating to find as there is just no new inventory coming in. The $34.99 Pokemon Go accessory has been spotted in stock at amazon.com for 1 minute once last week. All other online stores that carry the Pokemon Go Plus had no stock. Nintendo initially promised new stock for end of October. That did not materialize. Resellers offer the Pokemon Go Plus for $100 on Amazon's Market Place. How to Buy $99 New Nintendo 3DS Nintendo announced a new special edition of the New Nintendo 3DS console for Black Friday 2016 for $99.99. The hand-held console does not come with a game at this lowest price in history of the 3DS. The $99 3DS will go on sale on Thanksgiving Day at Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, GameStop and more. The $99 New Nintendo 3DS will sell out as one of the first Black Friday items on Thanksgiving Day. The 3DS is a perfect Holiday gift for kids and at $99 a bargain. So far only Walmart is listing the $99 Nintendo 3DS online. Check if Amazon.com has started to list the new 3DS deal. The first big Black Friday 2016 Sale is underway on Saturday at Sam's Club.

 Walmart is kicking off Black Friday immediately — but there's a catch Hayley Peterson Nov. 10, 2016, 12:01 AM 65,143 facebook linkedin twitter email print Walmart is kicking off its Black Friday deals this week. AP Walmart just kicked off some of its Black Friday deals more than two weeks before the shopping holiday. But there's a small catch: the deals are available only to users of Walmart's app for now. The discounts available through the app include a Hitachi 65-inch 4K Ultra HDTV for $599 ($400 savings), an Xbox One S 500 GB Minecraft console with a bonus controller for $279 ($20 savings), and an Acer 15.6-inch Core i5 laptop for $299 ($150 savings). The rest of Walmart's Black Friday deals will become available to all customers online at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on Thanksgiving Day, the company said. The in-store event featuring "doorbuster" deals like $230 off a $628 Samsung 50-inch Smart 4KTV will kick off at 6 p.m. that day, which is in line with what the company did last year. Some industry experts have said the significance of Black Friday is diminishing as an increasing number of retailers start offering holiday discounts days and weeks before the shopping day. But Walmart's chief merchandising officer, Steve Bratspies, said Black Friday remained the biggest shopping event of the year. "We think it's still the biggest event in retail that customers get really excited about," he said Wednesday in a call with reporters. An employee adjusting a large ribbon on a television display at Walmart in preparation for Black Friday in Los Angeles in 2014. REUTERS/Jonathan Alcorn In preparation for this year's demand, the retailer has increased its Black Friday merchandise by 50% on Walmart.com over last year. "I said it before and I will say it again: We will win the season on price — on Black Friday, on Cyber Monday, and every day before and after," Bratspies said. "That means delivering the Black Friday deals we're known for in stores, online, and on our app. And, we've secured significant availability of these items. We pride ourselves on not being the retailer who advertises a great price and then only has a few available." Here's Walmart's top Black Friday deals that will be available in stores and online on Thanksgiving, according to the company: 11 Televisions including 4K Ultra HDTVs, such as a Phillips 55-inch Smart 4KTV for $298 (special buy) and a Samsung 50-inch Smart 4KTV for $398 ($230 savings). Other television offers consist of a Vizio 60-inch HDTV for $398 (special buy), a 40-inch HDTV for $125 (special buy), and a 50-inch HDTV for $225 (special buy). Toys including the toy of the season, Hatchimals, for $48.88, Disney Princess Cinderella Royal Dreams Dollhouse with Furniture for $88 ($61 savings), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles RC Mikey for $39 (a Walmart exclusive at a $10 savings), and Razor Hovertrax 2.0 Hoverboard for $273 ($125 savings). Drones including the DJI Drone Phantom Standard 3 for $369 ($130 savings), the Promark 3D Virtual Reality HD Drone for $99 (a Walmart exclusive at a $49 savings), and the Sharper Image Video Drone for $30 (special buy).

Follow TechnoBuffalo Walmart recently revealed all of the items that will be available in stores come Black Friday. The weekly ad is chock full of tech, including plenty of discounted HDTVs, smartphones, accessories, streaming gadgets, home cameras and more. I took screenshots of the ad, which you can peruse at your will, but there are some standout deals that I spotted. If you buy a Galaxy S7 or iPhone 7 on AT&T or Verizon, for example, you’re eligible for a $250 Walmart gift card. You need to set an appointment ahead of time, however. Walmart’s Black Friday deals will save you big on tech For folks interested in creating a smart home, the Nest will be discounted from $249 to $199. The Nest Cam will cost $149, down from $299. For gamers, the Xbox One S Battlefield 1 bundle is priced at $249, down from $299. There are more than 65 games priced under $25, too, with many as low as $15 or $8. If you’re in need of a new laptop, Walmart has a variety of Windows 10 machines that are discounted down to as low as $99. Those super-cheap machines don’t always perform well, though, so keep that in mind before buying one. If you love movies, head to Walmart for those, too. More than 260 movies will cost just $3.96. Sure, most of us don’t use DVDs anymore, but if you buy a Disney movie, you can easily grab a digital copy for your smartphone or tablet. Boom, huge savings. And finally, TVs. There are tons of options, including a 4K 60-inch Samsung Smart TV priced at $648, which seems like a pretty good deal to me. Prices range from $98 for a 24-inch display to $798 for a 65-inch Samsung Smart TV, a $200 discount on the latter. Check out the full list in the gallery above, or hit the source to browse the full collection that also includes non-tech items. The sale kicks off at 6pm local time on November 24 in-stores. Good luck. Source Walmart Topics #Black Friday 2016 #Walmart Todd Haselton Todd Haselton has been writing professionally since 2006 during his undergraduate days at Lehigh University.

The Walmart Black Friday 2016 ad has just leaked, and we are back to tell you what you’ll want to watch for when it comes to mobiles. The Best Buy Black Friday ad was beastly, and the folks at Wallyworld are coming in at a close second at 30+ pages. The Walmart Black Friday 2016 ad is full of tech, toys and other wares which means there is a little something for everyone. We’re going to start with the mobile phone deals, of which there are plenty. That said, we would be remiss if we didn’t mention those 4K 50-inch TVs for $300 bucks. Good luck… Black Friday Apple deals usually aren’t all that great, let’s just be honest. This year things have improved a bit as the Walmart Black Friday 2016 ad has the iPhone 5s for $99 through Straight Talk while the 32GB iPad mini 2 rears its head again at $199. There are some Apple accessories and a $250 gift card offer through AT&T and Verizon on the new iPhone, but that’s about it. With Android, the choices are vast as usual. You can get the same gift card deal on a wide variety of Samsung branded handsets or opt for Straight Talk. They have the Galaxy Luna, Galaxy S6, and the Samsung Galaxy Sky up for grabs. AT&T has the Huawei Ascend XT on a prepaid plan for $49 and Big Red has the $49 Galaxy J3. Nothing crazy, but there are more deal hiding in the Black Friday ad. There are several deals with slates as well during the Walmart Black Friday sale. You can grab a 7-inch RCA tablet for $29 or the Samsung Tab E 7 lite for $49. Just don’t expect the world from those slates. The Lenovo Tab 3 10.1 is quite a bit better though, and is listed for only $99. Accessories include the Fitbit Flex 2 for $69, the Alta for $99 and the Fitbit Charge 2 for $129. The usual offers on media streamers, headphones and various other mobile goodies are present as well. Black Friday 2016 may not kick off for several more weeks, but that will not stop the onslaught of deals from coming. The Walmart ad is one of around a dozen we’ve seen this week, and we expect more to drop over the weekend. Rest assured, we will keep you in the loop on all the mobile Black Friday deals as we come across them.

Published Nov 11th, 2016 4:57 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon on Friday asked Hoyt Williams, a 93-year-old World War II veteran who works as a greeter in Trion, Ga., if he had any advice for the audience. “Just hang in there,” Williams answered. At the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of November, Wal-Mart Stores rolled out the red carpet for several World War II veterans who work or whose families work within the retailer’s vast ranks. The event was held at the retailer’s Bentonville headquarters. Williams served in the European and South Pacific Campaigns of WW II. After Potsdam, he was not ready to leave the military and return to civilian life so he was shipped to Seattle and then re-deployed to the Philippines until the war ended. Gary Profit, senior director of Wal-Mart’s military programs, said serving in both campaigns is rare, but then again so is someone who at 93 still wants to get more hours on the job. Williams has been a Walmart U.S. employee for the 23 years, a job he told Talk Business & Politics he sought after retiring from a 40-year run in the grocery business in his home town. “I told my wife when we left the grocery business and I was tired of mowing the lawn that it was time for me go back to work. I went down to my local Walmart and the assistant manager knew me. Her family used to buy groceries from me when she was a little girl. She said they could put me to work even though I was 70 years old and they did,” Williams said. He’s grateful the job which he works 4 days a week, but said he’d like to get mores if the store manager would given them. “Pay day is the best thing about the job,” he said. “I also like being with the people, retail is what I know,” Williams said. Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon and Lois Bouton, who served as a “SPAR” with the U.S. Coast Guard between 1943-1945. SPARs comes from the Latin and English translations of the Coast Guard’s motto, Semper Paratus! Always Ready! He said over the past 23 years he’s had several jobs at his local Walmart store working in various departments including sporting goods, hardware, electronics and even fabric before transitioning to greeter nearly 4 years ago. Wal-Mart has made clear its commitments to hire veterans of all ages. In 2013 Walmart U.S. committed to hiring 100,000 veterans in five years, but McMillon said the retailer accomplished that goal in three years. The company reassessed the goal in 2013 to hire 250,000 by 2020, setting the bar higher. Since 2013, McMillon said the retailer has hired 153,000 veterans and 19,000 of them have been promoted. McMillon introduced Johnny Martin, who works in asset management for the Sam’s Club in Oklahoma City. Martin is in the U.S. Army reserves and has served three tours in Iraq – totaling more than 32 months. He has a master’s degree and still had trouble finding work after returning home in 2014. He said Target passed on him, saying he was “too professional” essentially over-qualified for the positions they had open. Martin said he kept a running total of his jobs applications – 152 – before he landed a job at Sam’s Club. “I took an overnight position and thought I would work on finding career employment in the day. But I quickly saw it was working out and was promoted to a department level supervisory role in a short time frame. I was encouraged to apply for the asset management position at the new Sam’s Club but I thought it would go to some with lots more experience. I had only 14 months with Sam’s Club at the time,” Martin said. Martin was called to deploy just after Thanksgiving for a short tour in the Ukraine. “I have found Walmart’s commitment to veterans is not just an empty HR promise,” he said. Other speakers at the Veterans Day event included James McDonough Jr.. director of the Institute for Veteran and Military Families. Together with more than $40 million in funding from the Walmart Foundation, IVMF has programs in North Carolina, New York and most recently San Antonio, Texas. The programs work to help veterans today returning from service transition back into the workforce, school or some other form of service. He said someone retiring or coming home from extended service is jobless and sometimes homeless. While there are many programs and employers to help there is not anyone to help make the connections in what is a very fragmented sector. Helping veterans navigate the services and employment landscape is what IVMS does. Rear Admiral Terence McKnight (retired) also spoke at the event about the service today in the 21st Century. He remembers well the call he got while serving in the Pentagon in 2009 to help try and save merchant Captain Richard Phillips who was under attack by Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden. During 2007-2011, was in charge of operations to chase modern-day pirates that were a threat to commerce. “We have the greatest Navy in the world but we were not trained to chase pirates. I was the most scared guy out there. The Somali pirates do it out of desperation and annual income of just $350. Half of those pirates who go to sea don’t return. They have nothing to lose,” he said. Keeping the passage clear through the Gulf of Aden is crucial to commerce as some 25,000 ships pass through there annually. At the time of the pirate crusades he said there was not enough Coast Guard and Navy ships policing the region. He said the first and second groups his team captured, were released because the U.S. did not have a plan in place on how to handle those captured. He said those who had the misfortune to be captured by the Russians were not as fortunate. Walmart officials also encouraged the several hundred in attendance to support the “Green Light A Vet” marketing program the retailer introduced this time last year.  Profit said the idea of replacing an outdoor light bulb with a green bulb is hit, so much so that the retailer ran out of green light bulbs last year. Walmart said it sold 2 million green lights last year, and Profit said supplies are good because they have a better estimate on demand.

(Jeff Chiu/AP) By SARAH HALZACK WASHINGTON POST Walmart and Target each plan to kick off their in-store Black Friday sales at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving, repeating their start-times from last year and throwing some cold water on the notion that Turkey Day deals blitzes may be falling out of style. Earlier in the season, the Mall of America announced it would be shuttering its doors on the holiday after being open in previous years. Office Depot, too, made a similar reversal of course. But the plans from the big-box behemoths — as well as from Macy’s, Kohl’s and Toys R Us — suggest the Thanksgiving Day shopping tradition is going strong. Walmart said it will be “dramatically increasing” the amount of inventory it has available for online deal hunters, offering some 50 percent more Black Friday merchandise this year on the Web than last year. “We really pride ourselves on not being the retailer who advertises a great price but then only has a few available for the customers,” said Steve Bratspies, the chief merchandising officer at Walmart U.S., during a conference call with reporters. Walmart said its offerings this year would include items such as a Samsung 50-inch 4K television for $398 and movies that cost $1.99. Target, meanwhile, was touting deals such as an iPad Air 2 for $274 and 30 percent off apparel. Oh, and remember that giant $10 teddy bear that was all over social media last Black Friday? The retailer is bringing it back, and has bought 20 percent more inventory this time around. Both chains will start their online Black Friday sales in the early morning hours on Thanksgiving. And both will be offering a steady trickle of discounts over the next two weeks to encourage customers to get in the holiday spirit. In earlier announcements about their seasonal plans, Target and Walmart stressed they were trying to focus on making their promotions simple this time around. In the past, it seems, shoppers have been confused by a cavalcade of coupons or staggered sale starting times. At Target, that means returning to the “10 days of deals” program, something the retailer tried last year in which it touted a single big promotion each day starting the weekend before Thanksgiving. Walmart is also aiming for simple: Besides its limited-time Black Friday discounts, it plans to keep the rest of its price cuts in place for the duration of the November and December rush. The National Retail Federation, an industry trade group, forecasts that stores will ring up a healthy 3.6 percent increase in sales this holiday season. That would be an improvement from last year, when sales growth was up just 3 percent. We should soon get a clearer idea of what kind of momentum big retail has headed into this all-important time of year: Macy’s is set to report earnings Thursday morning, and Walmart, Target, Best Buy and others will do so in the following week.

The retailer, known for stampedes at its front doors in the wee hours of Black Friday morning, is changing a tried-and-true formula to attract shoppers surfing the Internet from the comfort of their homes in their pajamas. This year, Walmart will increase the number of items with Black Friday discounts allocated to online shoppers by about 50 percent, said U.S. Chief Merchandising Officer Steve Bratspies. Black Friday deals will be available days before the calendar actually hits Nov. 25, diluting what was once a one-day, deal-hunting frenzy. And as retailers have begun offering the same promotions online, they’ve made the idea of braving in-store Black Friday crowds less compelling for some shoppers. “If you’re a retailer, it doesn’t matter where you’re getting your business from, just that you’re getting the business. (Making sales available online) is much more in tune with what the consumer is looking for,” said Neil Stern, senior partner at Chicago consulting firm McMillanDoolittle. Walmart isn’t alone. For the first time, J.C. Penney will make its Black Friday specials available online at midnight Nov. 22 — more than a day before shoppers can get them in stores at 3 p.m. on Thanksgiving. And Kohl’s is letting online shoppers in on its 6 p.m. Thanksgiving “door-buster” deals for the first time this year, too. Like last year, Walmart, Target and Sears will give online shoppers a head start. Black Friday prices will be available online in the early Thanksgiving morning hours and in stores at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving. “We know that customers don’t exclusively shop in one channel — they shop online and in stores. Having omnichannel deals provides a consistent experience for our customers so they can shop any time and any way they choose,” said Kohl’s spokeswoman Melanie Hochschild. At some stores, such as J.C. Penney, Kohl’s and Sears, all Black Friday door-buster prices can be found online. Walmart will have most of those deals online, but some will still require a trip to the store. Target, J.C. Penney, Walmart, Kohl’s and Sears also offer certain online-only Black Friday deals before Thanksgiving through their apps and websites. Most people plan to start their holiday shopping before Black Friday week, and about 30 percent expect to make most of their purchases before the week begins, according to a survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers. And while the consulting firm expects fewer shoppers on Black Friday itself this year, that doesn’t mean stores will be quiet. Of the people who expect to shop during the week of Thanksgiving, a majority plan to do most of that spending on Black Friday. But more of the likely Black Friday and Thanksgiving shoppers surveyed by Accenture said they expect to shop online than in stores.

Now, the e-commerce behemoths are training their sights on everyday indispensables — groceries and household items. Over the past few months, both have poured hundreds of millions of yuan into a price war aimed at dragging shoppers away from supermarkets and corner stores. As sales of other goods reach saturation point for JD.com and Alibaba, groceries are the next battleground, said Ms Xu Xin, CEO of the venture capital firm Capital Today, which has invested in JD.com. Conquering the market for fresh food and other grocery items may eventually enable e-commerce companies to take control of as much as half of China’s total market for consumer goods sales, as Alibaba chairman Jack Ma predicted, Ms Xu said. In a letter to shareholders last year, Mr Ma declared that “over 50 per cent of China’s consumption will be conducted online within 10 years”. To reach that goal, “there will absolutely be a war between Alibaba and JD.com”, said Mr Cheng Shaoxiong, north China chief for the supermarket division of Tmall, Alibaba’s business-to-consumer site. He said online grocery sales are the last frontier for e-commerce companies. CHEAP, FAST COURIERS Online retail is flourishing in China, thanks to the country’s highly efficient and low-cost courier industry. Last year, online purchases accounted for 10.8 per cent of China’s 30 trillion yuan (S$6.15 trillion) in retail sales, a 32 per cent increase over the previous year, according to the National Statistics Bureau. For fast-moving consumer goods, including toiletries, soft drinks and fresh food, nearly 20 per cent of the purchases were made online. By 2020, online sales of fast-moving consumer goods will grow at a much faster pace than apparel and electronics to expand five-fold from today and reach 1.2 trillion yuan, according to Yihaodian, one of China’s pioneering online grocery sites. Fresh food and grocery items with quick turnover and higher profit margins have long been the competitive strength of large supermarket chains such as Wal-Mart and Yonghui Superstores. For e-commerce companies, moving into the sector requires heavy investments in logistics, warehousing and distribution. Alibaba and JD.com have made tit-for-tat moves to gain a foothold in the burgeoning online grocery market. On Oct 19, Alibaba and smaller rival Suning Commerce Group said they had established a new e-commerce joint venture with an investment of 1 billion yuan to manage Suning-owned stores on Alibaba sites. The venture is expected to combine the strengths of both companies. It is also a step forward for a partnership formed last year, when Alibaba became Suning’s second-largest shareholder through an equity swap. The next day, JD.com stepped up its partnership with Wal-Mart. It opened Wal-Mart-branded stores on JD.com, using its huge logistics network to offer fast deliveries for Wal-Mart in some cities. Wal-Mart also invested US$50 million (S$69.5 million) in the JD.com-backed online grocery specialist, New Dada. JD.com and Wal-Mart had formed a strategic alliance in June when Wal-Mart sold its China online grocery store, Yihaodian, to JD.com. Alibaba is the unrivalled titan in China’s online retail market. In the fiscal year ended in March, the company’s combined sales from its business-to-consumer site Tmall, consumer-to-consumer site Taobao and group-buying service Juhuasuan totalled 2.95 trillion yuan. That dwarfed JD.com’s sales of 462.7 billion yuan, generated mainly from business-to-consumer transactions. But JD.com is expanding at a faster pace. In the quarter between March and June, JD.com’s gross merchandise volume, a measurement of total sales value, grew 47 per cent from March to June a year earlier. Alibaba’s rose 24 per cent. “JD.com is coming within shooting range of Alibaba,” said a source close to Alibaba’s top management. Since the beginning of this year, Alibaba has set detailed monthly targets to counter JD.com, this individual said. Despite their healthy sales growth, both companies face the same challenge — a slower expansion of users after years of explosive growth. Alibaba had 423 million active users while JD.com has 188 million, according to company documents. TESTING THE WATERS Alibaba tested the supermarket waters in 2012 by launching Tmall grocery services in Shanghai and Hangzhou. But the “business proved to be very difficult due to high logistics costs”, said a former Yihaodian manager who declined to be named. It was not until July last year that the grocery business was listed as one of Alibaba’s four pillars of online retailing, along with Taobao, Tmall and Juhuasuan. That year, Alibaba spent 1 billion yuan in Beijing alone to subsidise grocery vendors and shoppers. Between 2012 and last year, Alibaba made heavy investments in logistics and warehouse facilities, enabling it to sell fresh produce, according to a staff member at Tmall. JD.com quickly set up its own online supermarket division in October last year. According to company financial reports, in the first quarter of this year, JD.com’s grocery sales rose 70 per cent from the previous year, while Alibaba’s supermarket sales grew 220 per cent. The expansion into groceries by the two e-commerce giants crushed smaller players. Wal-Mart-backed Yihaodian’s market share in the country’s e-commerce market shrank to less than 0.3 per cent in 2015 from 2.6 per cent in 2013, according to the e-commerce research website 100ec.cn. In the first quarter this year, the site barely recorded any growth from a year earlier. That prompted Wal-Mart to sell Yihaodian to JD.com in June in exchange for JD.com equity worth about US$1.5 billion. The strategic alliance with Wal-Mart is expected to give JD.com shoppers wider access to imported Wal-Mart products and provide more ammunition for JD.com’s battle with Alibaba. After the deal, JD.com announced a 1 billion yuan investment in Yihaodian over the next three months and an ambitious goal of developing JD.com as the largest grocery retailer in three years, according to JD.com vice-president Feng Yi. Alibaba quickly promised 2 billion yuan in subsidies for shoppers on its Tmall Supermarket site and 2 billion yuan of new investments to improve logistics and the supply chain. The price war has escalated since September as Tmall Supermarket poured 180 million yuan into discounts for grocery shoppers from Sept 1-9. At the same time, JD.com offered 50 per cent discounts on grocery items. Some experts have questioned the price-war strategy. “The gross profit margin of grocery items is less than 20 per cent,” said Li Chengdong, an independent e-commerce analyst. Offering such big discounts “is like burning money”. A source close to Tmall Supermarket said Alibaba can afford the discounting because of the parent group’s profitability. But concerns over heavy spending are greater for JD.com, which has yet to make a profit after 12 years in business. In June, JD.com’s share price on the New York Stock Exchange slumped to a historical low since its September 2014 listing. An APS Asset Management report had called money-losing JD.com “wildly overpriced”. The stock revived in August after the second-quarter financial report indicated a narrowing loss. Last year, JD.com lost US$1.4 billion, while Alibaba recorded a net profit of US$11.1 billion. FINE-TUNING STRATEGY After more than a decade, Alibaba and JD.com have developed distinct identities in online retailing. Alibaba’s Tmall and Taobao are the must-go places for many apparel shoppers because of their selection, offered by millions of vendors. JD.com has won more shoppers seeking branded electronic products. Alibaba has been focusing on operating platforms for numerous vendors and shoppers, while JD.com mainly sticks to direct sales backed by its highly effective, self-operated logistics network. But as the grocery war unfolds, both companies have sought to fine-tune their respective strategies and gradually move in each other’s direction. JD.com’s Mr Feng said the company’s supermarket division aims to challenge Alibaba’s strengths in cosmetics and apparel by expanding product variety. Meanwhile, Alibaba recently said it sees growth potential in home appliance and smartphone sales. The company has actively expanded using its logistics division, Cainiao, which now operates more than 128 warehouses across the country. Backed by Cainiao’s delivery capacity, Tmall Supermarket has adopted a JD.com-style direct-sales model, offering fresh produce sent directly from its own warehouse rather than a third-party supplier. At the same time, JD.com has been gradually changing its business structure by inviting more third-party vendors onto its platform. According to company data, third-party vendors accounted for 45 per cent of JD.com’s gross sales in the third quarter, up from 40 per cent a year ago. As the two companies’ strategies converge, both may increasingly face the same challenges, experts said. For instance, JD.com’s standardised customer services have long been blamed for a lack of interaction with shoppers, failing to lure users to surf among its product catalogue, as they usually do in Taobao and Tmall. At the same time, the huge number of vendors on Alibaba’s platforms has made controlling counterfeit or substandard products a longstanding headache. The e-commerce giants’ efforts to reshape their businesses echoed Alibaba chairman Ma’s call for e-commerce companies to adapt a radical change in the global retail industry as the boundary between online and offline sales becomes increasingly blurred. “In the coming years, we anticipate the birth of a reimagined retail industry driven by the integration of online, offline, logistics and data across a single value chain,” Mr Ma wrote to Alibaba shareholders in a letter last week. “With e-commerce itself rapidly becoming a ‘traditional business,’ pure e-commerce players will soon face tremendous challenges. This is why we are adapting.” CAIXIN mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most China&India READ COMMENTED “India really means business”: Iswaran ‘World’s cheapest smartphone’ to be launched in India ‘Voldemort’ attacks up ante in China-Japan propaganda war ‘Uncultured’ youth misled by religious extremists to blame for Tiananmen attack ‘This is our country!’ says Chinese official as Obama lands World Bank probe into Tata tea project finds it failed to protect Indian workers Workers laying roads in southern India rescued from debt bondage Trump, China's Xi establish sense of mutual respect: Trump statement Taiwan’s ruling party urges China to respect Hong Kong’s democratic aspirations Taiwan's ruling party urges China to respect Hong Kong's democratic aspirations Smog lifts, but companies' view of polluted Delhi skies is dim Moving to Shanghai?

Runge commending Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s commitment to sustainability efforts. The company recently unveiled a Sustainable Packaging Playbook for its suppliers. "Wal-Mart's commitment to sustainable products and packaging sets a remarkable standard for industries. The company's guidelines are a strong step in the right direction, and we hope their focus extends well beyond supplier packaging. Consumers deserve to know from what materials their products are made, and what impact those materials have on the environment. "Many may be surprised to learn that the packaging that Wal-Mart advises suppliers to avoid – PVC – is the same kind of material used in plastic pipes that can convey drinking water. If one of the world's largest retailers is encouraging its suppliers to avoid use of PVC plastic to improve environmental stewardship, we should encourage policymakers to similarly review the use of a PVC pipe material that is documented to be hazardous in its production and disposal. When making important decisions on the right materials to use in replacing our aging water infrastructure, the safe and reliable choice is Ductile Iron Pipe, which uses up to 98 percent recycled content, and is itself a 100 percent recyclable material." About the Ductile Iron Pipe Research Association Since 1915, the Ductile Iron Pipe Research Association (DIPRA) has provided accurate and essential engineering information about cast iron, and now Ductile Iron Pipe, to utility officials and consulting engineers. The association provides research, publications and personal regional engineer services, as well as representation on standards-making committees. While DIPRA member companies have different names and locations, they share a common commitment to produce and deliver the finest quality water and wastewater pipe material in the world, Ductile Iron Pipe, and at the greatest possible value to its purchasers.

(Photo by Elaine Thompson, The Associated Press) The state's voters passed Prop. 67, the plastic ban bag, but O.C. bucked the trend. (Photo by Elaine Thompson, The Associated Press) By DAVID WHITING / STAFF COLUMNIST Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF The Walmart cashier tosses groceries so fast into a plastic bag turnstile, it spins like a merry-go-round. A box of a dozen Clif Bars, one bag. Walmart’s raisin bran, the next bag. Bananas, another bag. Three items, three plastic bags. I’m in bag heaven. But my wife – who thinks we can’t keep treating the planet like a garbage dump – is horrified. Yet in a surprising twist to Tuesday’s elections, she’s in the minority in Orange County. Yes, California voters last week easily approved Proposition 67, the plastic bag ban. Yet in Orange County, voters overwhelmingly made it clear we love our plastic bags. Statewide, 52 percent of voters agreed it’s time to stop spreading around thin bits of plastic. In Orange County, a whopping 58.6 percent of voters said keep the plastic. For a county with a fragile diversity of wildlands, streams, estuaries, beaches, tide pools, ocean, it’s time to understand why the state’s plastic bag ban makes serious sense. That’s especially true for us plastic bag lovers. O.C. JOINS MAINSTREAM, ALMOST Know-nothings scoff at Orange County bucking the environmental awareness trend. Republicans, they say, don’t care about bags that destroy ecosystems, kill birds, harm fish. That’s silly. Plenty of Republicans are environmentalists. But even if environmental issues were divided along political lines, the Orange County of today is far different than the Orange County of my grandparents. In last week’s election, more people in the O.C. voted for Hillary Clinton than Donald Trump. That’s right, the county with an airport named after John Wayne and home to the library and museum of Richard Nixon is Clinton country. Put another way, Orange County is no longer an outlier in California politics. For better or worse, we’ve joined the Golden State’s mainstream. Orange County followed statewide voting patterns in 13 of the 17 initiatives. We said yes to marijuana; we decided porn stars don’t need to wear condoms; we even voted for further restrictions on firearms and ammunition. But – oddly – when it came to plastic bags, only 323,378 of us said ban them. Another 458,527 said keep them. My review of precinct breakdowns found that the only clusters in Orange County where the bag ban initiative flourished was near UCI and in Laguna Beach. Reasons vary for our love affair with plastic bags. We use them for lunch, for storage. Many of us like plastic bags because we think they are convenient. Some – like me – use them to scoop up dog poop. When I cleaned up after two dogs, it seemed like I couldn’t get enough of what I thought of as free bags. But nothing’s free. The plastic bag industry in California is an estimated $15 million a year business. It’s no surprise that a pro-bag lobby called the American Progressive Bag Alliance spent millions of dollars to delay SB 270, a bill approved by the California legislature a few years ago to ban bags. That’s right. The initiative we voted on last week was a do-over. With plastic bags going away, I decided to give cloth bags a try. Guess what? Other than having to remember to bring the darn things, I discovered I like cloth bags. Unlike plastic bags and the corresponding busted milk jugs, cloth bags don’t break. Best of all, they hold more groceries – and that means fewer trips from the car to the kitchen. A lot fewer trips. That’s just the beginning. JUST ONE WORD – PLASTICS There are 42 miles of beachfront in Orange County and if you’ve ever walked the sand, swam offshore, surfed, then you probably have hollered, “jellyfish,” only to discover a very yucky plastic bag. Bill Hickman is Southern California regional manager for the Surfrider Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on ocean and beach. One of its main missions is to reduce single-use plastics and increase the recycling of all plastics. That includes banning plastic bags. I tick off Orange County’s voting numbers for Proposition 67 and Hickman admits, “It’s frustrating Orange County hasn’t come around.” Despite the promise of plastics in the classic film “The Graduate,” Hickman explains when it rains, plastics are swept to the beaches along concrete riverbeds and into the ocean by storm drains. “Those little plastic bags are an immediate threat to wildlife, sea turtles.” The regional director lives in Ventura County and once spotted a cormorant that had been strangled by a plastic bag. So with the bag ban, should I buy those blue dog poop bags? Hickman says blue bags aren’t much better – unless they end up in an industrial dump. Instead, he offers a free solution: Look around, it’s surprising how many bags we have – bread bags, produce bags, bags from cereal boxes. Hickman offers another reason Orange County voters said no to the bag ban: We bought into the bag lobby’s claim that the bag ban is a money grab. Ouch. But according to ballotpedia.com, “Supporters raised $3.66 million, while opponents received $6.14 million. Most of the opposition’s funds came from plastic bag companies.” The state’s official election guide offers this official statement from Proposition 67 opponents: “It is a $300 million per year hidden tax increase on California consumers who will be forced to pay a minimum 10 cents for every paper and thick plastic grocery bag they are given at the checkout.” That may be true – but not if we bring our own bags. I suggest cloth.

How To: Find Pokemon Go Plus In Stock Walmart will as often is the case shave off 99c of the Nintendo suggested price. The white $99 New Nintendo 3DS is listed here and the black $99 New Nintendo 3DS is listed here. The title of the listings is a bit curious. Walmart calls the $99 3DS "New Nintendo 3DS Super Mario Edition." The 3DS is decorated with Mushroom Kingdom characters and imagery. Why Walmart calls it Super Mario is unclear.  The New Nintendo 3DS system combines portable gaming in a compact size with 3D technology, added control features and interchangeable Cover Plates. Take 3D photos, connect with friends, and enhance your gaming experiences with added amiibo support. The 3DS is recommended for kids seven and older, because of the 3D display. Walmart is known break sales embargoes, but we don't believe that Walmart will start to sell the New Nintendo 3DS before Nov. 25, Black Friday 2016. In an earlier report we compare the new $99 New Nintendo 3DS to other 3DS bundles. There is good chance that there will be a better deal on a New Nintendo 3DS XL with game comes in at a better deal.

November 11, 2016 08:00 ET Orbital Tracking Corp. Reports Third Quarter 2016 Financial Results Quarterly Revenue Grows 32%, Reaching Record Levels Driven by Strong EU Sales Despite Ongoing Currency Devaluations AVENTURA, FL--(Marketwired - November 11, 2016) - Orbital Tracking Corp. (OTCQB: TRKK) ("Orbital Tracking" or the "Company"), today reported financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Third Quarter 2016 Highlights In August, Global Telesat Communications Ltd. ("GTCL"), the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, was selected by the Electoral Commission of Zambia ("ECZ") to provide more than 200 satellite phones, satellite broadband terminals, associated airtime and customer support services to ECZ and its staff during the country's presidential elections which took place on August 11th. This is the largest sale of its kind awarded to GTCL in Africa. In September, Orbital Satcom Corp. ("OSC"), the Company's U.S.-based wholly owned subsidiary, expanded its North American online retail channel through Walmart's invite-only Marketplace at www.walmart.com. The Walmart online marketplace joins a growing list of U.S.-based e-commerce marketplaces operated by Orbital Tracking under the OSC brand including sites on Amazon.com, eBay and Sears.com. "We are pleased with the top-line growth recorded in the third quarter of 2016, traditionally one of the Company's strongest, as sales volumes reached record levels. Demand in our global markets in Europe remained high and were bolstered by significant new contracts in emerging markets such as in Africa with the ECZ and in the US as we continue to expand our presence in North America," said David Phipps, Chief Executive Officer of Orbital Tracking Corp. "Our global growth plans for Orbital Tracking Corp. remain on track despite the continued negative impact of devaluation of the GBP is having on GTC sales and our margins as reported in our financial results. We continue to invest in the business, expanding both our product portfolio and market reach which will help mitigate continued currency volatility while helping ensure we continue to deliver the best satellite communications and tracking solutions available combined with unmatched service and support that our customers expect." Third Quarter 2016 Financial Results For the three months ended September 30, 2016, consolidated revenues reached record levels, increasing 32% to approximately $1,299,373 as compared to approximately $982,775 as reported for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Consolidated revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased 28% to approximately $3,783,230 vs approximately $2,955,453 reported in the comparable 2015 period. Although product volume sales were at record levels during the third quarter, results continued to show the negative impact of depreciation in the GBP and EUR against the US$. Comparable revenue for the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries, GTCL and Orbital Satcom Corp.("OSC"), increased 53.5% to approximately $998,878 and decreased 1.6% to approximately $326,833, respectively for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Total GTCL sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, increased 34% to approximately $2,082,863. Total sales for OSC for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, increased 13.6% to approximately $991,422. The Company recorded net loss before income tax of approximately $338,672 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a net loss of $300,584, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a net loss of $1,452,463 as compared to a net loss of $955,185. The increase in losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, is attributable to interest and professional fees related to the Company's convertible debt and preferred share subscriptions in December 2015, offset by a decrease in stock based compensation.

The remodel provides expanded hardware and automotive departments, a refreshed electronics department and six new self-checkout stations. Customers will also appreciate improved customer service areas, including Money Services and Walmart Pickup. Shopping is more convenient than ever as Prince Frederick residents can shop millions of items on Walmart.com, many of which can be shipped for free to any Walmart store through Walmart Pickup. The store also has a remodeled pharmacy with a full range of products and services and immunizations offered in a private consultation room. Walmart pharmacists are ready to assist customers with product and prescription questions. Prince Frederick residents can easily transfer prescriptions and order refills on the go with the Walmart mobile app. “We are looking forward to re-introducing our store to the community with expanded offerings and a fresh look. Our everyday low prices will remain the same, but we’re adding greater convenience and a new and improved local grocery shopping experience,” said Tim Crowley, store manager. Join the Grand Opening Celebration Local associates will provide a special welcome to members of the Prince Frederick community with a grand reopening celebration. A brief ribbon-cutting ceremony will be held on Friday, Nov. 11, at 7 a.m. followed by family activities and free food samples while supplies last. On Saturday, Nov. 12 from 10 a.m. – noon and Sunday, Nov. 13, from noon to 5 p.m., customers can enjoy a grand reopening event with sampling and family friendly activities and special guests, the Prince Frederick police and fire department that will offer safety tips and fire prevention information. Job Opportunities At Walmart, associates have access to competitive wages, affordable benefits and the chance to build a career. More than 75% of store management teams started as hourly associates, and 40 percent of those promotions went to associates within the first year of their employment. Committed to the Community Walmart is committed to serving the Prince Frederick community and will support organizations through an approximate $2,000 investment in the coming months. The commitment to community goes beyond philanthropy. This investment is a whole company undertaking that is woven into Walmart’s day-to-day business activities, creating value by accelerating job mobility, developing suppliers and small businesses, lowering the environmental footprint of Walmart’s operations and more.   This entry was posted on November 11, 2016 at 7:18 am and is filed under All News, Business, Calvert News, Community, County, More News, Press Releases, z 600X120 Top Ad Top.

This year Walmart has debuted some of its most tempting deals on TVs, toys, electronics and more on its smartphone app so savvy shoppers can get a head start on their holiday gift lists. Stores will open at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving and there will be a few items available only at the brick-and-mortar locations but you may be able to find everything you’ve been looking for at Walmart.com where you can shop all day Thursday, November 24. Here’s a taste of the Black Friday deals to check out at Walmart. TVs Hot deals on big-screen TVs include a Samsung 50” Smart 4KTV for $398, a discount of $230. Walmart also offers four Special Buys: a Phillips 55” Smart 4KTV for $298, a Vizio 60” HDTV for $298, a 50” HDTV for $225 and a 40” HDTV for $125. The brands on the last two were not named and will vary from store to store. Plus a 40” Hisense or Class Element HDTV is also $125. If you choose a non-smart TV, you can still stream hundreds of movies and TV shows with the Roku Express Plus, now just $25. Complete the entertainment package with a Sanyo Blu-ray disc player for $35. Hundreds of DVD titles are on sale starting at just $1.96 and Blu-ray titles starting at $5.96. Gaming Walmart is always one of the best places to score the lowest price on all things gaming and this year is no exception. Sure to be a hit it is a PlayStation 4 Slim Uncharted 4 500GB bundle with $30 gift card for $249, a saving of $50. The XBox One S 500GB white Battlefield bundle is also on sale for $250, a discount of $50. Select top video game titles are now $27 each, a discount of $32.88. This includes assorted newly-released video games. Walmart stores will be offering wristbands for select items to in-store customers two hours ahead of time.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Hatchimals Walmart Black Friday Deal Is Most Surprising Posted: Nov 11 2016, 12:41am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 13 2016, 8:43am CST, in News | Black Friday   This story may contain affiliate links.   Buy This Now On Amazon The Hatchimals Black Friday deal advertised in the Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad raises a lot of questions. The Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad advertises Hatchimals for $48.88. This is a head-scratcher as Hatchimals are the hottest holiday toy of 2016 and are sold out for the most part. Don't Miss: Best Amazon Black Friday 2016 Deals Walmart's Black Friday event has a dramatic scale. The retail giant operates over 5,000 stores in the United States. For Walmart to decide to feature Hatchimals in their ad needs be based on a the availability of a very large inventory of Hatchimals.  Hatchimals Eggs are on sale for the Black Friday price already now at walmart.com, but to find the deal in stock is difficult. As reported, I managed to find a $48.88 Hatchimal online at walmart.com earlier this week. Spin Master, maker of Hatchimals, has warned consumers that the demand for Hatchimals is outpacing demand in the Holiday season and sets exceptions for increased supply coming in 2017. Walmart must be hoarding Hatchimals in their warehouses for the Walmart Black Friday sale.  There is no information about how many Hatchimals Eggs each Walmart store will have in stock and if the Hatchimals Black Friday deal will also be available online as it is now, in case there is stock. Walmart did mention the $48.88 Hatchimals Black Friday deal in the Black Friday 2016 ad announcement, which gives the deal additional attention. Walmart knows based on their decades of Black Friday sales experience, that things can quickly go wrong when extremely popular deals are in short supply in stores. We have seen physical violence as recently as last year of shoppers fighting for items in Walmart stores. The Hatchimals Black Friday deal is prone to trigger out of control situation. Hatchimals resell for about $150 on Amazon and eBay. This means that not just parents will be gunning for the Hatchimals in the Walmart Black Friday sale, it will be scalpers as well. Prices of Hatchimals are likely still to increase closer to the Holidays. Depending on the amount of Hatchimals coming into the reseller market after Black Friday, there might be a brief drop in prices.  So far only Walmart has announced Black Friday Hatchimals deals. Target for instance did not decide to advertise Hatchimals in the Target Black Friday 2016 Ad. We have a feeling that the ToysRUs Black Friday 2016 Ad will feature Hatchimals. ToysRUs has a history of offering hard to find holiday toys as doorbusters on Black Friday. Update: The ToysRUs Black Friday 2016 Ad just leaked and does not advertise Hatchimals. Walmart is so far the only store to offer Hatchimals on Black Friday. The Walmart Black Friday 2016 sale begins midnight on Thanksgiving Day online and at 6pm in stores. You can browse the full 36-pages of the Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad online. Walmart will once again open on Thanksgiving Day. The 6pm store opening time is the same as last year. Wristbands for doorbuster deals could be handed out as early as 2 hours before the Walmart Black Friday 2016 sale begins. Ask at your local Walmart store when wristbands have been handed out last year to prepare your shopping schedule. The big three Black Friday 2016 ads are released.

The pickup machine, which remains without an official name, is playing catch up to the changing ways that millennials are shopping at retailers. Stationed inside Walmart store number one, off Walnut Street in Rogers, the large orange pick up machine is hard to miss. It currently is the only one located in any Walmart around the world, and remains in test mode. A growing demand for online shopping and picking purchases up in-store has the retail giant finding ways to streamline the process. "We're jumping up from one or two [in-store pickups] a day to 15 to 20," said Justin Wright, manager of the pickup department. "That's just pickups today." Only general merchandise, which excludes grocery items, can be added to the machine. The process starts when a pickup order is submitted online to the Walnut St. location in Rogers. Employees are then notified and retrieve items for the order, wrap it or box it, and then put it in the machine. "As soon as it's been processed and BIN'd, the customer will be notified within 15 to 20 minutes," Wright said. "When they arrive, they'll check in and an employee will help get their order." Wright said that in other stores, pickup items are behind the customer service desk, but using the pickup vending machine has already proved to be a time-saver for both employees and customers. No extra cost for using the service is added to a customers bill. "It helps the customer, in and out, even if they're done shopping, they can pick their stuff up," Wright said. "It's very time saving, and it doesn't keep your associates locked down so they can help in other spots."

Arturo Garcia Updated: Nov 11, 2016 Share - - Claim: A woman pulled a Muslim woman's hijab inside a Walmart and told her, "Go hang yourself with it around your neck." unproven Example: [Collected via Email, November 2016] Origin:On 9 November 2016, a Muslim woman named Maha Abdul Gawad posted the following story on Facebook of a confrontation she alleged took place at a WalMart store in the immediate aftermath of the 2016 presidential election won by Donald Trump: My first racist encounter after our new joke of a president, as I am at Wallmart [sic] today a woman came up to me and pulled my Hijab of and said "this is not allowed anymore, so go hang yourself with it around your neck not on your head" I am traumtized. [sic] He post was soon shared thousands of times and was also posted on Walmart's Facebook timeline. The company has not responded to that post, but a company spokesperson told snopes.com on 10 November 2016 that they was trying to establish contact with Gawad to obtain more information about the alleged incident. Walmart also sent snopes.com the following statement on 11 November 2016: We take what has been alleged seriously We attempted to look into this matter but have been unable to verify that the claim posted to Facebook by a customer actually took place, and the page has been removed. Gawad has not responded to our request for an interview. Police in her community (which we will not reveal to protect her safety) said they had not been contacted regarding such an encounter. Gawad's post is one of several stories of anti-Islam (and other) harassment that have circulated online since Donald Trump was elected president. Another Muslim woman described a similar incident in New Mexico on Twitter, in a post that has been shared more than 17,000 times. Guys, a trump supporter tried pulling off my hijab... This is not a joke anymore, all non-whites have become targets. Stay safe ? — bye (@Palestixian) November 9, 2016 The Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), a leading American Muslim advocacy group, has already called on Trump to "repudiate" such attacks. The group's communications director, Ibrahim Hooper, told us: We're hoping that perhaps Donald Trump as president will be different than he was while campainging for the presidency. We'll just have to see. We're just gonna maintain our defense of civil rights and religious freedom and any time those rights are challenged, we're gonna speak up and take legal action. Hooper did note that one woman recanted her initial account of an attack at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. But even that case, he said, could be connected to an increase in phone calls CAIR has received from Muslim Americans facing mental health issues: I think it is symptomatic of the real anxiety and stress in the American Muslim community. It kind of brings this issues to the surface.

Published Nov 10th, 2016 6:05 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas In an effort to boost online sales and give shoppers an easier experience Walmart U.S. has added a mobile check-in feature for its stores with an online grocery pickup service. The retailer announced the launch Thursday (Nov. 10), three weeks ahead of Thanksgiving. Sam’s Club has offered mobile check-in, but this is Walmart’s first attempt at the service for its growing grocery pickup business that will be available in 100 markets by the end of the year. Walmart recently turned on the mobile check-in option in all of the markets offering online grocery pickup at stores. Once a shopper places an online grocery order and receives a confirmation that it’s ready for pickup the customer uses the Walmart Grocery app to “check-in” when they are about to go to the store. The “check-in” status then signals store employees to begin assembling items in the customer’s order. As the customer pulls into the pickup area the employee is there waiting ready to load the grocery order into the customer’s vehicle. Walmart is hoping an easier process for customers to order online and pickup groceries will pay big dividends. Tina Budnaitis, Walmart store manager at the Pleasant Grove supercenter in Rogers, said the soft test of the mobile pickup was popular with customers once they tried it. She said it saves them three or four minutes in the pickup process, or maybe longer if the order also includes Walmart.com general merchandise item like a chair that has to be pulled from the back of the store. “Customers who use the mobile check-in can now have their grocery order and general merchandise ready to load when they pull into the bay. We still offer the in-store pickup option with the kiosk and waiting area at the front of the store for those who want to come inside and buy a few more items they have left off the list,” Budnaitis told Talk Business & Politics. When asked how she expected the service would be used ahead of Thanksgiving, she said each holiday pickup is growing in popularity with customers because it also helps them have more time planning for the holiday meal and less time shopping for the ingredients. “We have some customers who basically do their entire holiday cooking order online, including the turkey. We expect that will continue,” she said. Logistically, Budnaitis said the mobile check-in option sends a ping to a store once the shopper is on their way. The previously packed order is pulled onto the cart, the frozen and refrigerated items are added last. Once the shopper pulls into the parking lot another ping is sent to the employee’s tablet to alert them to head for the pickup delivery area. “We require shoppers pull into the bay and we are there waiting when they do, within a second or two,” she added. Michael Bender, Walmart.com executive, said earlier this year that 90% of Walmart grocery pickup users are repeat customers. Walmart has not said how many of its store customers are using the service. Walmart continues to offer promotions in some markets to spur demand for the service with incentives of $10 or more for using it or referring it to friends. Walmart continues to say its own feedback relative to pickup is overwhelmingly positive. Getting people to try the service the first time is perhaps the largest hurdle given that consumers are creatures of habit and shopping for groceries online is still far from mainstream. Keith Anderson, vice president of strategy and insight for Profitero, told Talk Business & Politics that pickup grocery is more costly for Walmart to operate than the traditional store model because of the added labor costs for picking and processing the online orders. He said Walmart isn’t offering pickup necessarily to get new customers but to give its customer base another way to purchase groceries. “It’s not a purely defensive play against competitors. It’s about retaining the shoppers they already have,” Anderson said. Other retail experts applaud Walmart’s grocery pickup strategy that is now also offered in select markets by its largest U.S. grocery competitors, H-E-B, Kroger and Publix. Another aspect of offering the mobile check-in option is that it drives shoppers to the Walmart mobile app, where they can use WalmartPay, activate Savings Catcher and automate prescription refills. Carol Spieckerman, CEO of Spieckerman Retail, said the retailer can also gain benefits from the mobile check-in feature in addition to the customer benefits, but the added service will require additional pressure on Walmart to execute flawlessly and consistently on a store-by-store basis, regardless of store traffic volumes and staff levels. Shoppers are doing their part, Walmart will be expected to do the same, she said. “Although privacy concerns might be a major obstacle, it will be interesting to see if geolocation and the ability for Walmart to track a shopper’s journey to the store will be a possibility,” Spieckerman added.

While shoppers have had their fun over the past week browsing circulars from Walmart, Best Buy, and Target, ads from a few very important retailers are still missing. Since Black Friday is now less than two weeks away, this coming week should see the remainder of the ads for the most important stores come out. You can see a full selection of the latest 2016 Black Friday ads at BestBlackFriday.com, and Amazon, Macy’s, and eBay should be added to the list within the next few days.

Amazon’s Black Friday 2016 Ad Projected Release Date Amazon.ca Kicks off the Holiday Season with the Launch of its Black Friday Deals Store https://t.co/gykXMm14s4 pic.twitter.com/G8C7e01N7A — Grocery Alerts (@groceryalerts) November 5, 2016 Amazon has not released an actual Black Friday circular in a few years, and it is unlikely that they will for 2016. Their strategy is to put out an official press release a little over a week before Thanksgiving. In 2015, the press release, as seen on Amazon’s website, came out on November 18, which was eight days before Thanksgiving. This press release acts as an ad because it lists most of their major doorbusters. Regardless, they always have a few surprises on Thanksgiving and Black Friday. This is done on purpose, as Amazon waits for all of their competitors to release their ads first. As the Inquisitr reported, Target, Walmart, and Best Buy’s circulars were all released within eight hours of each other earlier this week, so Amazon has had plenty of time to review prices that the competition is offering. Assuming they follow the same pattern as last year, their press release should come out on November 16, which is eight days before Thanksgiving. They will probably begin their “Countdown to Black Friday Sale” on November 18, which is a full week of holiday deals. Of course, you should wait until Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday for the best doorbusters. Since Amazon does not offer free shipping with no minimum order size, it is important to know their terms. Prime members can enjoy free two-day shipping on all orders, but non-Prime members must spend at least $49 in order to qualify for free shipping. Compared to the competition, Amazon’s shipping policy is extremely mediocre. Best Buy and Target are both offering free shipping with no minimum size on every order, so keep that in mind for small orders. Macy’s Black Friday 2016 Ad Projected Release Date In order to give you an idea of what Macy’s ad will look like, you can find a screenshot of the first page of their ad from last year below. Black Friday in NYC- Departs 24 Nov 3NTS 4* Four Points at Sheraton. Macys Shopping tour+ more included. Call now on 01-8822500 to book pic.twitter.com/8HPgXWZYqT — Garda Travel Club (@GardaTravelClub) November 1, 2016 From 2012 to 2015, Macy’s released their ad in October three out of the four years, so it is a surprise that they are holding out this year. Regardless, most of the ads from their competitors are now out, so it is likely that Macy’s releases their ad towards the early parts of next week. As the screenshot from their 2015 Black Friday ad shows, Macy’s opened at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving. For 2016, they will open at 5 p.m., which has already brought them significant backlash. Macy’s spokeswoman Holly Thomas told Fortune the reason to open earlier. “In response to significant, ongoing customer interest in shopping on Thanksgiving, both at Macy’s and at many other retailers, we will be opening our full-line department stores at 5pm on Thanksgiving Day.” Whether the Macy’s ad is leaked or they release it themselves remains to be seen, but it should be out by Wednesday. Otherwise, this year would mark the latest that it has been released in years. eBay’s Black Friday 2016 Ad Projected Release Date In order to give you an idea of what eBay’s ad will look like, you can find a screenshot of the first page of their ad from last year below. How to find the best eBay Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals #ebay #checkoutebay https://t.co/g5FyONegiE pic.twitter.com/PSuTpyl8OP — CheckoutEbay (@CheckoutEbay) November 14, 2016 Typically thought of as more of a player on Cyber Monday, eBay has had one of the stronger Black Friday sales in recent years. With everything online, the typical process of waiting outside for long hours on Thanksgiving and Black Friday is avoided. Their Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday ads were released last year on November 14, which is around the same time they usually come out. For 2016, expect them towards the middle of next week. eBay GM of Deals Jesse Kiefer recently provided BestBlackFriday.com with insight into their upcoming holiday sale. “Cost-conscious shoppers should do their homework to find the best deals throughout the holiday season, especially for big-ticket items such as TVs, laptops, and gaming consoles. And, they should look at more than just the price. Most items featured on eBay’s Deals pages ship for free, include 30-day returns, and offer the opportunity to purchase a 1, 2, or 3-year warranty at a cost that is much lower than what a buyer warrantee typically costs at big box retailers.” Additionally, Kiefer noted that eBay’s sale will start on Thanksgiving. “Specific to great Black Friday deals, eBay will be launching hundreds of new deals starting at midnight (11/24). New deals will post every two hours throughout the night and all day on Black Friday.” [Featured Image by Mario Tama/Getty Images] Now Read This: Black Friday 2016 Target, Toys R Us & Walgreens Sales Deals Include HDTVs, Xbox One & PS4 Games, Pet Supplies & More Share 2 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Phillip Dengler Comments LATEST HEADLINES ‘Teen Mom’ Amber Portwood Shows Off Plastic Surgery Results, As Her Fiancé Finally Comes Clean About His Sobriety Chili’s Restaurant Apologizes After Manager Takes Army Veteran Ernest Walker’s Free Meal On Veteran’s Day Olivia Newton-John Launches New Christmas Album With John Farnham, Delights In Daughter Chloe’s Successful Recovery Peru Vs.

What happens when a rare beetle comes back from the dead Associated Press | MIAMI (AP) — A tiny beetle thought to have vanished from the planet decades ago and rediscovered in a patch of pine rockland near Zoo Miami became the latest disappearing insect added to the nation's endangered species list Nov. 4. First discovered in the 1930s near Barry University when much of South Florida was covered with pristine pineland, the Miami tiger beetle appeared to have been lost as development across the region wiped out their forest habitat. In a 2006 field guide, entomologists concluded the feisty little beetle was almost certainly gone. But in 2007, a butterfly collector stumbled across several near the zoo, a rare Lazarus moment that has since helped reignite efforts to save the last isolated tracts of pineland. One of those tracts where the beetle was found, among the largest remaining pine rockland forests outside of Everglades National Park, is being targeted for a Walmart shopping center. "That particular type of landscaping is vanishing and once it's gone, you can't get it back," U.S. Fish and Wildlife spokesman Ken Warren said Nov. 4. "What it comes down to is the people of Florida are going to have to make difficult choices about what's important." Federal wildlife managers are now considering designating critical habitat for the Miami tiger beetle, which would map out boundaries and measures to further protect the pineland, which must be maintained with regular fires that replicate South Florida's natural wildfire season. A decision is expected by next Fall, Warren said. While the beetle won't stop Palm Beach County developer Peter Cummings from building the 88-acre strip mall, apartments and parking — since he unveiled plans, two butterflies found in rockland have also been listed — the protection means he will now have to also accommodate the beetle. A spokesman for Cummings said Nov. 4 he is continuing to work with federal officials, who are reviewing a proposed conservation plan. The Center for Biological Diversity, which sued the federal agency in 2011 to speed up a backlog of species waiting to be reviewed, applauded the listing, which the organization considered among the nation's most urgent. But they also worry about delaying protections for the beetle's habitat. "The politics of who may be wanting to develop on that habitat should not come into play," said Jaclyn Lopez, an attorney and Florida director for the Center. "The leading cause of species extinction is habitat loss and that's why it's so important to protect habitat." Miami-Dade County has also proposed building a Disney-style theme park on adjacent rockland, but backed off those plans as criticism mounted over the Walmart. Earlier this year, architect Bernard Zyskovich said the county had put the project on hold until wildlife managers completed their study. As for the tiger beettle, when collector Frank Young first discovered it in 1934, entomologists initially presumed it was a cousin of other local beetles. When the distinction was drawn years later, and Young reported the exact location of the find near Barry University, it was too late. Collectors returned, but were no longer able to find any. In a 2006 field guide, entomologists concluded the beetle was probably lost, wiped out by development and collection over the decades — the tiger beetle with its iridescent green armor was among the most prized finds. When the butterfly collector came across a small population in South Miami-Dade, entomologists considered it at high risk because of the continued pressure on its nearly vanished habitat. A second small population of Miami tiger beetles, aggressive ant-eating insects about the size of a fingernail, was found last year about three miles away in another small chunk of pine rockland. In an updated 2015 "Field Guide to the Tiger Beetles of North America and Canada," noted entomologist Barry Knisely and his colleagues reported the Miami species was "arguably the rarest and most endangered of the U.S. tiger beetles." Among entomologists, that's a grim pronouncement. But for South Florida, it also meant that so little of the pine rockland remained that even the tiny beetle was having trouble finding a place to roam. "We have roughly two percent of pine rockland remaining and what remains is highly fragmented," said Emily Bauer, the lead biologist for the Fish and Wildlife Service. "We have just two populations and they're thought to be really small and isolated from each other." ___ Information from: The Miami Herald, http://www.herald.com © 2016 The Associated Press.

Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon announced Sultemeier's departure during the company's Veterans Day celebration Friday but did not discuss a specific date. Sultemeier has been with Wal-Mart since 1989. "The word that kept coming to my mind is character. Chris has character," McMillon said during the Veterans Day event. "You've been a really important part of this company and we appreciate your service." Prior to his current position, Sultemeier was senior vice president of transportation services and also held various logistics and merchandising roles in both Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam's Club throughout his career. He was promoted to executive vice president of logistics in 2012 and is currently responsible for all distribution and fulfillment centers as well as domestic and global ocean transportation functions, according to his biography on the retailer's corporate website. Sultemeier was a captain in the U.S. Army before joining Wal-Mart. He is a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and has a degree in mechanical engineering. -- Robbie Neiswanger Trucking group meets with Trump team American Trucking Associations President and CEO Chris Spear said in a release that the group had "already begun meeting with President-elect Donald Trump's transition team" to discuss regulatory issues facing the trucking industry. In his campaign's plan for his first 100 days in office, Trump had promised "$1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years" that he called "revenue neutral." Shannon Newton, president of the Arkansas Trucking Association, said the industry is "cautiously optimistic about the opportunity to work with President-elect Trump to address some of our industry's challenges." She highlighted "investing in our nation's infrastructure, strengthening our economy, reforming the tax code and limiting government overreach" as "areas of our mutual concern." -- Emma N. Hurt Airlines encounter brief computer glitch DALLAS -- Airlines are dealing with another computer glitch that is disrupting flight schedules heading into the weekend. American Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Alaska Airlines confirmed that a technology glitch briefly interrupted their operations Friday, and other carriers may also have been involved. The problems seemed to have been fixed by midday, and airlines reported that flights had resumed. The airlines blamed their difficulties on a breakdown in systems operated by Sabre Corp., a Texas company that provides software and other technology services to airlines and hotels. A Sabre spokesman said the systems were running again by early Friday afternoon. She said she did not know the cause of the breakdown. -- The Associated Press Grubhub CEO recants anti-Trump email CHICAGO -- The co-founder of food delivery service Grubhub sent an email to all his employees suggesting that supporters of President-elect Donald Trump should resign, then issued a statement saying he welcomes all employees, regardless of their political beliefs. CEO Matt Maloney's email Wednesday said he rejects Trump's "nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics" and that anyone who disagrees should immediately resign "because you have no place here." In a tweet Thursday that was later deleted, Maloney said, "Grubhub does not tolerate hate and we are proud of all our employees -- even those who voted for Trump." Maloney later issued a statement saying his email advocated for inclusion and tolerance and that Grubhub doesn't discriminate based on political beliefs. Chicago-based Grubhub connects online customers with takeout restaurants in the U.S. and London. -- The Associated Press 3 arrested in U.K. insider trading probe Three employees from major banks have been arrested in an insider-trading investigation that could become the U.K.'s biggest case related to the crime, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority is working with the National Crime Agency, which is assisting with covert surveillance, the people said, who didn't want to be identified because the investigation is private. The arrests of the workers, whose identities haven't been disclosed, were carried out in recent months and more are planned, according to the people. An insider-trading probe was made public last week in a report by the government on the so-called Panama Papers scandal. The briefing said that a task force, set up to investigate leaked documents from a Panama law firm, had "identified a number of leads relevant to a major insider-trading operation" led by the Financial Conduct Authority and supported by the National Crime Agency. Officials at the regulator declined to comment and a spokesman for the crime agency declined to immediately comment. The news of the arrests comes six months after the Financial Conduct Authority concluded a major trial in an insider-trading case dubbed Operation Tabernula. -- Bloomberg News Brazil files protest of U.S. steel tariffs GENEVA -- Brazil has filed a complaint at the World Trade Organization against the U.S. over duties imposed on Brazilian steel products. A WTO announcement Friday on the filing comes amid questions about how the U.S. will interact with the Geneva-based trade body after President-elect Donald Trump's January inauguration. WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo tweeted Wednesday that the WTO "stands ready to work with the new administration." Brazil claims the U.S. violated WTO subsidy rules by imposing higher tariffs over the past year on Brazilian cold- and hot-rolled steel flat products in response to alleged improper Brazilian government subsidies. Brazil's request for "dispute consultations" centers partly on allegations that a U.S. investigation into Brazilian steel products was based on insufficient evidence. The WTO said further information was expected in coming days. -- The Associated Press Business on 11/12/2016 Print Headline: Business news in brief Tweet ADVERTISEMENT More Business Retailers say election made public too distra...

McMillon updated the retailer's progress in its goal of hiring at least 250,000 veterans by 2020 during a Veterans Day ceremony Friday at the company's home office. About 19,000 of those veterans hired as part of the Veterans Welcome Home program have been promoted within the past three years, the update said. "We're looking for leadership skills," McMillon said. "We're looking for people who have discipline. People who can run stores and bigger parts of our business that can help develop other people. With a military background, you have those skill sets." The Walmart Foundation also announced Friday that it has awarded a $5 million grant to the Institute for Veterans and Military Families for its AmericaServes program, which offers veterans the tools needed for transitioning back to civilian life. The funding is in addition to last year's $1 million grant. -- Robbie Neiswanger Still on rise, index ends day at 347.22 The Arkansas Index, a price-weighted index that tracks the largest public companies based in the state, continued its climb, rising 5.51 to 347.22 Friday.

(KSN) – It was a horrific crash Friday morning where the only one who survived was the driver of a semi truck. It started with the report of three people shoplifting about 11-hundred dollars worth of items from the Newton Walmart. Police “spotted” one of the two suspect vehicles heading for Hutchinson. Newton police say the car was stolen and, the chase reached speeds of more than a hundred miles an hour. 24 miles down the road, the car swerved to miss stop sticks on the highway and crashed into the front of a semi. The two suspects, 27-year-old Wendell Lue Hicks, III and his passenger, 48-year-old Lee Francis Billinger were pronounced dead at the scene. KSN sat down with Newton Police Chief Eric Murphy Friday afternoon to talk about their vehicle pursuit policy. Murphy says they have about 10 to 15 factors they take into account before deciding whether or not to pursue a vehicle. “One is the nature of the crime, another would be whether we know who the individuals are that are trying to elude us,” said Murphy. Murphy says other factors include the amount of traffic in the area, the location of the pursuit and the overall general safety of the public. KSN asked, who is responsible for making the call to engage in a pursuit? “It’s kind of a judgement call on the officer based on the information that he has as to whether, what level of crime it is,” said Murphy. Murphy says any member of their command staff has the power to call off a pursuit at any time, if they feel the danger is too high to the public. The chief adds there is no set time limit for how long they pursue a vehicle. KSN asked Murphy, with the suspects vehicle reaching speeds of up to 115 miles per hour, would there have been a point in time under their per policy, to stop the pursuit? “Had we went into a heavily populated area like the city of Hutchinson, we would have probably looked at terminating the pursuit,” said Murphy. Murphy says for simple thefts, like shoplifting, they usually don’t pursue vehicles. KSN asked him to explain, under their policy, why they did in this case? “They attempted to steal 11-hundred dollars of property from Walmart, they were also driving a vehicle they had put stolen tags on and so this just wasn’t a regular shoplifting,” said Murphy. Murphy says his staff will be reviewing the incident today to make sure the policies they have in place for vehicle pursuits were followed correctly. He says they review the policy on a one to two year basis, making sure they are utilizing the best practices. The Newton police chase policy limits the number of units they send in a pursuit. They have to make sure some officers remain in the city, to deal with local emergencies. Two newton officers were part of today’s pursuit, which is within policy.

(KSN photo / Chris Arnold) HUTCHINSON, Kan. (KSNW) — A shoplifting at a Newton Walmart led to a police chase Friday afternoon that ended in the death of two men. Police said three individuals attempted to pay for merchandise in a self-checkout lane with fraudulent credit cards which were declined. They got away with items worth approximately $600. Newton Police Chief Eric Murphy told KSN an officer caught up with a red Pontiac reportedly involved in the report heading west on Highway 50 with two men inside. He called in the license plate and found that the car was reported stolen. Officers then attempted to stop the car and it took off at a high rate of speed. Speeds during the chase reached 110 to 115 mph. As the car approached the Haven / Buhler road east of Hutchinson stop sticks were deployed to try to stop the car. The driver of the car swerved to avoid them and lost control, striking a tractor-trailer that was stopped at the intersection. Lee Billinger.

It’s silly to compare the $17.99 “rollback” price tag on the flag to how much it costs to represent the faith and freedom with which our country has been so richly blessed. The freedoms we enjoy are priceless – and we have God and our Veterans, past and present, to thank for all the blessings we take for granted. It’s fitting that Veterans Day is in the same month as Thanksgiving – when we are able to pause and reflect on a portion of the things with which we’ve been blessed. CLICK HERE TO JOIN CALEB'S FACEBOOK PAGE! I will display my American flag that is technically 17 dollars and 99 cents, but let’s be honest, my American flag is priceless and I can look at it and know that it did not come without sacrifice – freedom isn’t free – and I don’t have the words to adequately express my gratitude, so I’m just going to leave you with this POWERFUL message from one of our Vets to the anti-Trump protesters/thugs burning the flag: 🇺🇸America First from a Patriot🇺🇸 ck roo 👉🏻@TCBTRUMP👈🏻 speaks truth about American Patriotism and respect.#ThursdayThoughts#SemperFi pic.twitter.com/fJDKuDwpuV— MAGS 🚨MAGA🚨 (@magnifier661) November 10, 2016 To our Vets, ‘Thank you!

Published Nov 11th, 2016 2:57 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Chris Sultemeier, executive vice president of logistics for Walmart U.S., will retire Jan. 31 – the end of the company’s fiscal year. The announcement was made by Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon at the retailer’s annual Veteran’s Day event held Friday at the corporate headquarters. Since 2012, Sultemeier has been responsible for all distribution centers and fulfillment centers as well as all domestic and global ocean transportation functions. Prior to that he was senior vice president of transportation services with responsibility for the retailer’s domestic transportation, the private fleet global transportation. He joined Walmart in 1989 working in various roles of Walmart and Sam’s Club in logistics and merchandising. There has been no word from Walmart on who will replace Sultemeier next year. Prior to joining Walmart he served as a U.S. Army Captain and is a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point with a degree in mechanical engineering. He service on boards includes the University of Arkansas Supply Chain Center and the Rogers-Lowell Area Chamber of Commerce. Sultemeier took the stage at Friday’s event to interview retired Brigadier General Anne MacDonald, who was a former West Point cadet. MacDonald said she grew up an Army brat and was recruited to be among the first female class of cadets at West Point 40 years ago. She described the experience as difficult on many levels, but said the lessons learned there helped to shape who she is today. Chris Sultemeier, executive vice president of logistics for Walmart U.S. “I loved putting on that uniform everyday through 30 years of active service. But you can’t keep it on forever,” MacDonald said. Aside from reaching Brigadier General status, MacDonald holds several certifications in military air assault and is a former helicopter pilot with a military combat unit. MacDonald said being part of the first class of female cadets at West Point was eye opening. After only accepting men since 1802, her guidance counselor in 1976 encouraged her to apply given her family’s military background. “I thought they wanted me, but when I got there it was not very welcoming to say the least … it was hard to be accepted but we hung in there and it was worth it,” she said. Her advice to veterans and civilians is keep pushing toward goals, saying there will be falls, but remember to fall forward so that it’s easier pick yourself up and continue.

Follow TechnoBuffalo I knew the NES Classic would be difficult to find—but not this hard. Super Mario Bros. 3 will have to wait another day. The truth is I wasn’t anticipating trying to find the NES Classic this morning. I figured I’d wait it out and get one closer to the holidays —maybe online or by waltzing into Walmart. But that mindset is just plain naive. If you think smartphones are difficult to find at launch, you haven’t tried getting a Nintendo console on launch day. I barely succeeded in getting a Wii when it launched in 2006. While heading to work this morning, I got a call from TechnoBuffalo’s Executive Editor Todd Haselton asking if I wanted to try finding the NES Classic at a nearby store. I was up for the adventure so we went right over to Target at the Irvine Spectrum in Orange County, California. It was about 20 minutes before the store opened at 8 a.m., and the line was already about 40 people deep. That wasn’t a good sign. We figured that, with some luck, the store might have enough units even though we were pretty far back in line, which was growing with every passing minute. By the time 7:50 a.m. hit, a Target employee came outside and started handing people little green pieces of paper. One by one, the people in front of us received a ticket, guaranteeing them the NES Classic. We weren’t so lucky. This particular location only had about 30 units, not nearly enough for the crowd that had gathered outside the store. The same Target employee announced that although units were spoken for at this particular location, another Target about ten minutes away had many more. So that’s where we went. When we got there, the store was already open, so we made a mad dash inside, where dozens of people were lined up at the check-out stands. After about ten minutes of hushed anticipation, the last unit was sold—and we once again came up empty-handed. And we weren’t the only ones bouncing around from store to store. A guy behind us said he checked Walmart and a few other stores around the area with no luck. Another woman said she got up extra early to get the NES Classic but came up short. Many other disappointed customers were also turned away. We checked a nearby Gamestop that was opening at 10 a.m., but there were around 40-50 people waiting, so chances were slim there’d be enough units. There was plenty of demand but very low supply—and that sucks for people who have been waiting months to get their hands on the mini-console. Sure, you can go on eBay where the Classic is marked up by several hundred dollars, but paying upwards of $500 for an emulator is a bit extreme. Line for NES Classic at Target pic.twitter.com/pYOtBn2wgj — Todd Haselton (@robotodd) November 11, 2016 Low supply, astronomical demand What’s funny—or sad—is that the NES Classic is just a tiny Linux computer—although it’s more powerful than it looks. Not helping matters was the lack of a pre-order campaign, which meant consumers had to go to stores and hope for the best. Consumers like me, who left disappointed. All this bother for games you can easily play on your computer with the help of an emulator. But that’s the power of nostalgia. Cram 30 classic games into a small plastic enclosure and people will go wild (myself included). Luckily, there will be more units over the coming weeks, according to a statement from Nintendo provided to TechnoBuffalo. But before the busy holiday season? Who knows. Joey Davidson, TechnoBuffalo’s head of gaming, brought up a question about artificial scarcity. After traveling from store to store all morning, one has to wonder how it’s possible Nintendo wasn’t able to make more in time for launch, especially when the NES Classic was announced months ago. Unless Amazon has units in stock today, I’ll probably continue to bounce from store to store, in search of an experience I enjoyed growing up. I can easily download OpenEmu for Mac or something similar for Windows. But where’s the fun in that?

Published Nov 11th, 2016 11:42 am pgatling@nwabj.com / @tbarkansas An Oklahoma-based investor has paid $56.8 million to acquire the nine-story Bentonville Plaza office building and 16 additional acres, near the the headquarters of Wal-Mart Stores. Square Deal Capital Inc., founded in 2013 in Oklahoma City, purchased the multi-tenant building at 609 S.W. 8th St. and surrounding land in two separate deals, which both closed Thursday (Nov. 10), according to Benton County land records. The 275,000-square-foot Bentonville Plaza (3.18 acres), the tallest building in Bentonville, and contiguous land totaling 7.51 acres sold for $54.8 million. For $2 million, Square Deal bought an adjacent 8.68 acres to the south along U.S. Highway 71 Business, property that once included the George Nunnally Chevrolet auto dealership. The site is largely a crumbling parking lot and has been vacant for more than five years since Nunnally moved to a new Bentonville location on Moberly Lane in July 2011. The seller in both deals was FBE Limited LLC of New York, a privately held real estate and capital management company. FBE Limited also owns Bentonville Commerce office park, an eight-building group of properties with 120,000 SF on 10.8 acres, just off South Walton Boulevard behind two strip mall centers, the Bentonville Post Office and Burger King. Sage Partners, a commercial real estate management firm headquartered in Fayetteville, will continue to provide full-service management and brokerage services for Bentonville Plaza, which is about 98% occupied, according to Sage Senior Vice President Grady Mathews. Simmons Bank partially financed the purchase with a $36 million mortgage. Square Deal representatives declined to comment, and instead referred questions to Mathews. “There is obvious value to owning property in Bentonville,” Mathews said. “Walmart is here, and this is a group that understands our market. This will be a good addition to the portfolio of Class A office space they already have.” Mathews said plans for the Nunnally property and other acreage surrounding Bentonville Plaza are still being discussed, adding the idea is do something within the next year. Construction on Bentonville Plaza began in May 2003 and the building opened to tenants the following year. Pitcairn Properties Inc. of Jenkintown, Pa., was the developer, and the building was designed by Sydness Architects of New York in collaboration with Harrison French of Bentonville. The property includes the IDK Café restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating, as well as a fitness center with key card access. Mathews said the building has 34 tenants. The largest is Tata Consultancy Services, an IT services, business solutions and outsourcing organization based in India. The firm has prominent signage near the top of the building’s exterior, and its offices occupy the entire ninth floor, about 30,000 square feet.

"Following" : "Follow"}} November 11, 2016 12:17pm   Comments Share: Related WMT Retail Earnings On The Docket: All The Important Dates You Need To Know Are Monthly Retail Sales Noise Or News? The Week In Review And The Week Ahead (Seeking Alpha) Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) is set to announce its third quarter financial results on November 17. Barclays projects third quarter EPS of $0.97 versus Street view of $0.96. The brokerage models US comps ex-fuel of +1.3 percent, and EBITDA margin contraction of 40 bp. Analyst Karen Short laid out three scenarios for shares when Wal-Mart releases its earnings: "[U]p (moderate %): US comps ex-fuel accelerate on a stacked basis (above 1.3% consensus) with a y/y EBITDA decline at a LSD percent or better and the 4Q EPS guidance range puts 4Q $1.33 consensus at the midpoint (4Q guidance range of ~$1.25-$1.40)”; "[F]lat (reasonable %): US comps ex-fuel moderate slightly on a stacked basis (in line with consensus) but remain above 1% in 3Q with a y/y EBITDA decline at a LSD percent and the 4Q EPS guide brackets $1.33 consensus on the high end (4Q guidance range of ~$1.20-$1.35)”; "[D]own (moderate %): a y/y EBITDA decline in excess of a LSD percent (driven by gross margin deterioration), US comps in line with consensus and $1.33 (consensus) is at the high end of 4Q EPS guidance range." The retail giant’s results would benefit from improved traffic from higher customer scores, new shoppers and additional spending from existing customers. On the other hand, food deflation, competition from discounters and e-commerce will pressure earnings and comps. Meanwhile, some investors were disappointed by the company's FY 2018 EPS guidance (flat year-over-year), but its outlook was unchanged when exclduing e-commerce spend. However, Short believes slowing unit growth and an increase in remodels will help comps in FY 2018. But, the analyst says these investments would position Wal-Mart to be a long-term omni-channel winner. Short has an Overweight rating on Wal-Mart shares, with a price target $82.

The figures generated much excitement after being unveiled by WWE Hall of Famer Sting during a Nickelodeon panel at New York Comic Con in October. The one-of-a-kind collaboration between Nickelodeon’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and WWE has united two of the most popular brands in entertainment, bringing the Turtles from the sewer to the ring for the first time. The action figures were developed by Playmates Toys, the longtime master toy licensee for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and are available in the following assortment: · Leonardo as WWE Superstar John Cena · Raphael as WWE Hall of Famer Sting · Donatello as WWE Superstar Undertaker · Michelangelo as WWE Hall of Famer “Macho Man” Randy Savage Each 6” tall figure is highly detailed to capture the signature look of the WWE Superstar. They are also fully articulated and come with full ring gear and all the necessary accessories to perform knockout ninja moves in the ring. “The initial response to Ninja Superstars has been incredible and we’re thrilled that the figures are now available for fans,” said Karl Aaronian, Senior Vice President of Marketing, Playmates Toys. “WWE and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fans will appreciate the high level of detail that was put behind the development of the collection in order to create the unique Turtle figures.” “Following its unveil at New York Comic Con last month, the enthusiasm from TMNT and WWE fans for Ninja Superstars has been off the charts,” said Jon Roman, Senior Vice President, Toys, Nickelodeon. “Ninja Superstars is one of our most exciting collaborations to date and, with the holiday season just around the corner, we can’t wait for fans to get their hands on them.” “We are thrilled that the Ninja Superstar action figures are now available exclusively in Walmart just in time for the holiday season,” said Casey Collins, WWE Executive Vice President, Consumer Products. “Fans of both WWE and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are sure to enjoy this one-of-a-kind collaboration between two of the most iconic brands in entertainment.” About Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Since its launch in 2012, Nickelodeon’s all-new CG-animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has re-energized these iconic characters of this wildly popular franchise. Currently in its fourth season, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is seen in over 170 countries and territories and translated in 50+ languages.

There are a few other places it can be purchased, but for now the only online location is Amazon. This release comes just in time for the holiday shopping season or – some might argue – a bit too early for the holiday shopping season. How is a true retro Nintendo fan supposed to wait several weeks before getting one of these as a stocking stuffer? According to Nintendo, the following is an appropriate way to introduce this new version of the old NES: “Are you ready to go back in time? Grab your neon sunglasses and jelly bracelets. Things are about to get radical.” Yes they are going to get so very radical indeed. The console has been released this morning to Amazon and physical stores will have stock by Sunday, at the latest. Each console includes a single controller and the system, which itself is relatively tiny. It’ll still look like the original NES, but it wont be nearly so bulky. Instead of being the size of a couple of Kleenex boxes, this console is now the size of a small stack of CD jewel cases. In the box comes the NES Classic Edition system, one NES Classic Controller, an HDMI cable, an AC adapter, and 30 pre-installed games. The 30 pre-installed games will be all the user is able to work with, ever – this isn’t the sort of console you buy and buy new games every few weeks. The set of games here is the set you’ll have, from the start until the end. Unless we get into hacking the device and modifying what it does, which is also entirely possible, but not recommended by Nintendo. This sort of thing happens all the time with every single console ever. But for now, Nintendo’s set of games is what you’ll get. UPDATE: According to GameSpot’s senior reviews editor Peter Brown on Twitter, it’ll be impossible to add new games. Unless you like to get in deep and dirty to hack away at the machine physically. Which might not be the worst idea in the world if you want to go all-in, hardcore. The above gallery shows the games included with this console, all 30 of them from launch. This console will cost users $60 USD and is said to be coming to Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop, and Target first. But Walmart is inevitable, and Amazon is the only store with stock right this minute.

(Photo: David Kadlubowski/The Republic) The Arizona Capitol dome was lit up in green Friday to honor Veterans Day, as a part of Walmart's Greenlight a Vet campaign. Greenlight a Vet is a campaign, run by Walmart, that encourages people to change just one of the lights in their home to green in honor of "some of our nation's bravest, hardest-working men and women," according to the campaign's website. Why green? According to the website, the color represents hope, renewal and well-being. The term "greenlight" is also commonly used to initiate forward movement. "The simple gesture of changing one light to green creates a beacon of support and appreciation, and a visible symbol of our commitment to 'greenlight' veterans forward as valued members of our community," a statement on the campaign's website said. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, who decided to light up the Capitol dome, said it was important to take Friday, Veterans Day, to honor the nation's veterans. "Arizona is home to 600,000 military veterans," he said in a statement. "Today we thank them, and their families, for their sense of duty and for their patriotism, which has never wavered, in times of great sacrifice. Your state, and your country, is forever in your debt. Thank you for your service." Participants in the Greenlight a Vet campaign were encouraged to post photos of their green lights with the hashtag #GreenlightAVet. Walmart, of course, has green lights available for sale.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     How To Find Nintendo NES Classic Edition In Stock Posted: Nov 11 2016, 8:29am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 12 2016, 11:20am CST, in News | Black Friday   This story may contain affiliate links. Credit: Nintendo   As expected the new Nintendo Entertainment System completely sold out right at launch. Update Nov 12: NES Classic sells now on the Amazon Marketplace. Don't Miss: Best Amazon Black Friday 2016 Deals The launch day Nintendo NES Classic Sales events at Amazon and Dell have sold out in minutes. Amazon offered the Nintendo NES Classic Edition at 5pm ET on Nov. 11. The NES Classic sale on Amazon at 5pm ET on November 11 was a disaster. The NES mini was only in stock for seconds and many customers lost it in their cart during checkout. The demand by far outstripped the supply Amazon had available. There are no new scheduled NES Classic sales known. It is back to using in stock trackers such as zoolert. Note, in the case of the NES Classic, mobile and email notifications are too slow. You need to use the webpage alert feature and keep the page open on your computer. Switch on the sound alert. When you hear a notification sound, flip to the browser tab where zoolert is open and find out which store as stock. Then its just a matter of luck and a fast mouse hand. The in stock notification on the Nintendo NES Classic Edition page on amazon.com is also too slow for ultra-high demand items like the NES Classic. For some reason there are no marketplace offers yet on the NES Classic on amazon yet. There are plenty of reseller offers on the hard to find Hatchimals. The Nintendo NES Classic is so rare that prospectors asking thousands of Dollars on eBay for it. There is one listing asking $13,000 for a NES Classic. This is insane. More reasonable offers on eBay for the NES Classic are around $300. Auctions on the NES are going over $250. The premium buyers end up paying is more than $200. The NES Classic is much more over priced than the hard to find Hachimals. Resellers have started on Nov. 12 to offer NES Classic deals on the Amazon marketplace starting at $189 plus $12 shipping. Other deals for the NES Classic on the Amazon marketplace are $250 and up.  There are already many accessories for the NES Classic. The My Arcade GamePad Classic Wireless Controller for the NES Classic Edition Gaming System is available for pre-order on amazon.com for $14.99 and ships November 30. Find more NES Classic accessories to enhance the trip to the 80s. Especially extension cables for the controller are a necessity according to reviews of the new retro Nintendo Entertainment System. Going wireless is though the way to go, especially at a low price of $15. Nintendo has issued a statement on Twitter on November 11 acknowledging the shortage of the NES Classic Edition. "The Nintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition system is a hot item, and we are working hard to keep up with consumer demand. There will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year. Please contact your local retailers to check availability." This is not that comforting to consumers. Nintendo completely underestimated the demand for the $59.99 NES Classic Edition. It might be intended by Nintendo to create a shortage, but this one seems too extreme.  The Nintendo NES Classic Edition launched with a big party in the Nintendo's New York flagship store. Attendees of the launch event had a chance to pick up one of the $59.99 NES Classic Edition consoles. Right after launch the NES Classic is sold out at all online retailers. We have picked the NES Classic early on as an item to buy before Black Friday. It sold out on launch and NES Classic is not advertised in any Black Friday 2016 ad. eBay Buy Now offers are priced already at $200 for the Nintendo NES Classic. This is more than three times the regular retail price.  The next best chance right now to get a NES Classic is to visit stores this morning or try the Dell NES Classic online sale listed below. The NES Classic is sold at: Amazon Walmart Target GameStop BestBuy Dell ToysRUs The Dell site says that the retailer will start selling the Nintendo NES Classic, today, Friday at 11am ET. Delivery is 7th of December. The Dell NES Classic offer might be the best chance to bag a Nintendo NES Classic today. The $59.99 mini retro console is the perfect holiday gift for old and young video game fans. This console will be the surprise hit for nintendo this Holiday Shopping season. Now the Nintendo NES Classic is as hard to find or maybe even harder than the Hatchimals. The NES Classic console is officially on sale as of November 11. The shrunk NES console features the classic Nintendo NES controller many geeks have grown up with. The retro console comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES games including Super Mario Bros., Pac-Man, Metroid, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby's Adventures.

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases DEADLINE ALERT: Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC Reminds Investors of Class Action Against MoneyGram International Inc. (MGI) & Lead Plaintiff Deadline-November 14, 2016 NEW YORK, Nov. 11, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Attorney Advertising — Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC reminds investors that a securities class action has been filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on behalf of those who purchased shares of MoneyGram International Inc. (“MoneyGram” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:MGI) pursuant and/or traceable to the secondary public offering completed on or around April 2, 2014 (the “Offering”). This class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).   The Complaint alleges that MoneyGram allegedly made false and misleading statements and omissions regarding Walmart’s possible entry into the money transfer business and the likely effect it would have on the Company. On April 17, 2014, two weeks after the Offering, Walmart publicized that it was initiating its own money transfer service on April 24, 2014. Following this news, MoneyGram’s stock dropped close to 30%. No Class has yet been certified in the above action. To discuss this action, or for any questions, please visit the firm’s site: http://www.bgandg.com/mgi or contact Peretz Bronstein, Esq. or his Investor Relations Analyst, Yael Hurwitz of Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC at 212-697-6484 or via email info@bgandg.com. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address and telephone number. If you suffered a loss in MoneyGram, you have until November 14, 2016 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn’t require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC is a corporate litigation boutique.

COMMENT Getting mobile marketing right is imperative to modern business success Ben Lobel As a small business owner, you might feel like your mobile marketing efforts are falling by the wayside. It’s difficult to compete with corporate marketing strategies from companies like Walmart and Amazon. You’re in luck because today helpful software provides nearly everything you need for small business success. 1. Leverage mobile apps to promote When it comes to mobile marketing, an app is probably the first marketing tool that comes to mind. As of 2015, more than 51 per cent of consumers are accessing marketing information from mobile devices – people access their smartphones more than their computers. The great news is that you can probably find drag-and-drop application development software with templates designed specifically for your niche. You can use a branded app for sharing promotions, providing easy access to your responsive website, receiving order information, or anything else you can think up. App uses are endless. Whenever I mention mobile apps, I like to share the genius way that Metro Trains in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia raised brand awareness through a ‘public service announcement’ launching Dumb Ways to Die. The app was intended to engage audiences that didn’t want to hear any kind of safety message. It went viral. You probably don’t want your app to look like an ad for your business. 2. Use mobile advertising networks to complement your ad campaigns When it comes to advertising for mobile, your best bet is to get on board with mobile advertising networks. Some 98 per cent of ad blocker use comes from desktop devices, meaning that only 2 per cent of those with ad blocking tools use them on their mobile devices. Your ads are more likely to be seen on mobile, so why not invest wisely? A mobile ad network will basically connect your ads with others who can share on their apps and mobile sites for a small profit. Let the network take care of the placement of your ads within your parameters. Then, sit back and watch the traffic roll in. 3. Take advantage of text messaging services The most widely and frequently used feature on smartphones is text messaging. Text messages have extremely high open rate – they are opened an astounding 98 per cent of the time while emails have an average open rate of only 28 per cent. That’s why SMS marketing pays off if you use it right to promote your business. Leveraging a bulk SMS service you can take the hassle out of text messaging automation, contact management, and access everything from your computer, rather than sending individual messages from your phone. Just make sure that everyone you contact has opted in to receive communications to their cell phone so that you’re in compliance with privacy laws. 4. Don’t forget to check the responsiveness of your website You can use Google’s mobile-friendly test to find out if your website is responsive for the majority of the traffic you receive (remember, more people are on mobile devices than computers). If you find that your site is less than optimal for traffic from smartphones and tablets, and you take the steps to remedy the issue, you could see major increases in your page rank. Using a website that isn’t optimised for mobile could cost you more than half of your traffic, increase your bounce rate, and decrease your search engine rankings. This isn’t a risk worth taking. 5. Pay attention to your analytics tools data If you’re not already analysing traffic to your mobile website, apps, and mobile web content, you need to. Your website, social media profiles, and mobile apps should be monitored by some sort of analytics tool so that you know what’s working to increase traffic and sales, and which efforts aren’t doing your campaigns any justice. 6. Get listed in local directories Mobile friendly local directories like Yelp and search engines have location-based targeting, maps, and reviews. These elements can be key when running a successful small business. Online business reviews affect the trust of up to 72 per cent of consumers. So, if you’re not managing your own small business listings in places where the public can leave reviews, you could be missing out on one of the best mobile brand building experiences available. Being in local searches will give you an advantage, especially if you’re in a populated location. When someone does a mobile search for your type of business, as a basic rule, the closest listings will show up first. Registering your business in local searches means you’ll be the first to catch people’s attention when they’re nearby. 7. Implement online ordering… Offline In the case that you are offering some sort of service (food, beauty, etc.) and the foot traffic is somewhat heavy, you can offer an online shopping cart offline. Most people will have a smartphone handy, so use a QR code or short URL on your food or service menu for easy access. You can also offer a public tablet or mobile device that will automatically direct customers to your order screen. Around 93 per cent of restaurant visitors will order digitally if offered a dedicated device. 8. Minimise the steps to arrive at your website with QR codes When it comes to offline advertising, most people will access your site from mobile devices. Rather than force people to type in the entire URL of your site or specific content, offer QR codes as an alternative. Some 39 per cent of women and 56 per cent of men have scanned QR codes, which can make the mobile browsing experience much more convenient. Conclusion As you employ the above tools, your mobile marketing campaigns will see fast gains. Just stay up to date with technology, and remember – the less your marketing looks like traditional advertising, the more it will engage customers and lead to sales.

White people need to speak out Paula Young Lee Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics: Elections 2016, Homophobia, LGBT, president-elect donald trump, Racism, Sexism, Xenophobia, Life News, News White people voted Donald Trump into office — not all white people, of course, but white people. To nearly everyone’s surprise, however, the good white people secretly sighing over Trump’s bigly manliness weren’t the people of Wal-Mart or any other ignorant hillbilly redneck stereotype, but stay-at-home wives crushing on the billionaire lifestyle, breadbasket  evangelical Christians and white-collar workers with retirement portfolios. In other words, the Donald mesmerized the college educated, solidly middle class and suburban bourgeoisie into voting for him. As Paul Mason noted in a trenchant analysis, Trump won “because millions of middle-class and educated US citizens reached into their soul and found there, after all its conceits were stripped away, a grinning white supremacist.” The data backs Mason up. The Trump phenomenon was never solely about economics; the global rise of right-wing xenophobia and white racial identity politics has played some role as well. Ironically, this fact is so plain that most pundits apparently assumed that a Trump presidency could never happen in the U.S. precisely because the American Dream is — or rather, was — predicated on a Judeo-Christian model that accepts all comers in its nondiscriminatory ecumenical embrace. “Give me your tired, your poor/ Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” The famous lines written by Emma Lazarus on the base of the Statue of Liberty are riffs on Matthew 11:28. “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.” Xenophobia and selfishness are, simply, un-American values. But the American reality has always been about violently affirming the political power of whiteness. One supposes that this is what Trumpers meant when they applauded the Donald for “telling it like it is.” Arguably, he won because of, and not in spite of, his bigotry, sexism, vulgarity, anti-intellectualism, willful ignorance, false piety, charlatanism and incompetence in business. By reveling in his abject failures as a human being yet refusing to apologize for them, his very existence was a weirdly honest acknowledgement that the American Dream was always just that — a dream. The “real” America ached to be acknowledged. And this gritty body politic was not America the Beautiful but America the Bully. On Nov. 9, Day One of Trumpland, people of color started turning to social media to report physical assaults, verbal abuse and hate crimes being perpetrated against them. (See a growing list of depressing tweets being collected here. More stories are being collected on a dedicated Tumblr called “It Has Begun 2016.”) New York Daily News columnist Shaun King’s Twitter feed has been serving as a hub for self-reported racist attacks, most of which are subsequently confirmed via local news outlets and police reports. They are not, despite the conspiracy theories inevitably advanced by Trumpers, hoaxes and false flag operations concocted by Hillary Clinton supporters in an attempt to cast Trump in a bad light. Only the willfully blind can fail to see that President-elect Trump has made racism culturally permissible, given that attackers often explicitly connect their hateful acts to his leadership. For example, here is a G-rated one: “Aren’t you [black and brown people] supposed to be sitting in the back of the bus now? Like Trump is president!” The reports go on and on and on. Around the country, spray-painted swastikas are appearing, including one proclaiming, “HEIL TRUMP.” A nonwhite author of my acquaintance just discovered that her college visit was canceled because someone draped a noose around the neck of a black doll and left it in an elevator. Ellen Oh of We Need Diverse Books tweeted that well-dressed white boys were walking past people of color at the mall and hissing, “Trump” at them. Racist messages are appearing in schools, such as one scrawled on a black student’s locker in a high school in Minnesota, saying “F**k N*****s.” Offended by the language? Be offended that a teenager thought this was OK to write. There are dozens upon dozens of similar reports of foul invectives being hurled at children of color around the country, as well as unconfirmed reports that eight trans kids responded to the news of Trump’s election by committing suicide. All this and more, in just 36 hours, at the time of this writing, in Trumpland. Even manicured lawns and swollen bank accounts can’t protect bourgeois families from being exposed to the racist bile because the bile is being hurled by their own. The town of Wellesley, Massachuestts, is one of the wealthiest and most attractive suburbs in the country. It is the home of Wellesley College, a private women’s liberal arts college and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s alma mater. Yesterday, two young white men drove a blue pickup onto the serene oasis of Wellesley campus, while prominently flying a Trump flag from the truck bed along with Confederate regalia. Violently inserting themselves into the well-tended landscape, the two white men laughed and screamed as they sped by startled female students, so proud of themselves for acting like racist jerks that they made a video of it. Various Wellesley students reported that they harassed women of color and openly queer women, calling one student a “dyke.” Then “they parked in front of the house for students of African descent and jeered at them, screaming ‘Trump’ and ‘Make America Great Again.’ When one student asked them to leave, they spit in her direction.” Dear white people, it’s time for you to come get your boys. Earlier this year for Salon, comedian W. Kamau Bell and best-selling author Adam Mansbach argued that Trump was “a white people issue.” That it was now incumbent on white people to feel embarrassment over Trump strictly on the basis on their shared whiteness, they said. To feel a racialized responsibility for him the same way that any person of color is made to feel whenever another black or brown person ends up on the news. For white people to recognize that Trump was not an aberration but the pinnacle of white institutionalism. That it was time, in other words, for good white liberals to “come get their boy,” to sit him down and set him straight before things became worse. Well, they’re worse. Newly released from the tyranny of “leftist political correctness,” apparently white men are not only unleashing their resentment against highly accomplished women by openly harassing them, but they are also rightly expecting to be rewarded for their misogyny. This is the lesson of former “Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush and President-elect Trump, both of whom profited quite handsomely from doing exactly that. These charmers are not the hardscrabble sons of the Confederacy but the educated scions of wealthy East Coast families. I’m talking about Bush and Trump, of course, but also about the Wellesley spitters: They are currently enrolled at nearby Babson College, which has not identified them to the press. Meanwhile, on social media, students at Babson are circulating their names and their reputed connections. Their exploits are known because they bragged about them. There are multiple eyewitnesses and photographs. They directly invoked Trump as motivating their racist actions. They are not George Soros and John Podesta wearing “Mission: Impossible” masks. Yet their fellow students at Babson apparently do not expect the administration to discipline them, let alone the local police to do anything. Their fraternity, to its credit, did expel them, according to The Boston Globe. This bunkered institutional response, this systematic marginalization of the most vulnerable, this dismissiveness of those without social standing, without deep local roots, without entrenched professional networks and the reflexive goodwill of authorities — this whole nexus of things unsaid and the reality of legal rights as a selective political net is why nonwhite American citizens, as well as LGBTQ and religious minorities, and people with disabilities are now legitimately fearful for their safety in this country. To read the litany of humiliations and attacks on people of color will induce fear in any person possessed of some degree of empathy. But what is truly terrifying is to realize, with the cold pain of a searing truth slicing like a knife through your eye, that nice white people are going about their day, loftily pretending that none of this is happening. These incidents are ugly. Nice white people prefer to live where Life is Beautiful™. Even once white people are made aware of the sudden proliferation of racist and sexist abuse being done in Trump’s name, the majority react by seeking to minimize its effects. It’s just name calling, bitch. Grow a spine, snowflakes. What does Trump have to do with it? He didn’t spit on you, did he? Because white institutionalism will protect its own, using the PR of public patronage to whitewash its sins. Many of these incidents are taking place in schools, and the perpetrators are white teenagers and children. They are feeling out the limits of permissibility, testing out the new rules. The lack of response from other white people is tacit confirmation that being a racist is the new cultural norm as well as a social necessity to prove your bona fides as one of Trump’s minions and future member of “Trump Youth.” Good white people must start calling this out before the full rage is unleashed after Trump is sworn in, doing the work to make it clear to other white people, through action, words and deeds, that that neo-Nazism, white nationalism and all the rest is not condoned by what remains of the American experiment in democracy. This work is difficult. It’s easier for white people to mock and belittle, lest you have to confront your peers and say to their face: This is not OK, we are better than this, that Trumpers are not the racist bullies the Hillbots accuse us of being. By saying nothing and doing nothing, however, you merely confirm that yes, actually, you are. I know a lot of Trump voters yet can’t name a single one who repudiated the Ku Klux Klan’s formal endorsement of Trump, who decried the celebrations of white nationalist leaders following his election or said one word regarding the anti-Semitic threats being spewed at Jewish journalists throughout Trump’s campaign. Good white people must stop telling themselves that overt racism is the behavior of a few outliers or claiming that it’s the work of impoverished rural whites who don’t know any better. When children in schools around the country repeatedly chant, “Build a Wall” in order to taunt their Latino peers (as reported by the Detroit Free Press), this is good evidence that the racist rot is broadly cultural, not localized and exceptional. And these behaviors are learned. Paula Young Lee is the author of "Deer Hunting in Paris," winner of the 2014 Lowell Thomas "Best Book" award of the Society of American Travel Writers.

CST November 11, 2016 Chaz Gilley (Photo: WFAA) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST FORT WORTH, Texas -- Police have a arrested a second suspect in connection with the murder of a Fort Worth teen last month, and according to an arrest affidavit they were "laughing and bragging" about their crime. Lajerrian Morgan, 24, was arrested Wednesday and charged with capital murder. A few weeks ago, James Murphy, 37, was arrested and also charged with capital murder. "It's senseless; they did it for nothing," said Chesala Markham, mother of victim Chaz Gilley. Gilley, 18, was gunned down in broad daylight on East Berry Street in Fort Worth. He was riding his bike home from Wal-Mart, where his mother said he had gone to cash a $400 paycheck. "They killed my boy because they wanted what he had, and they didn't want to earn it themselves," Markham said.   In a jailhouse interview three weeks ago, Murphy denied any knowledge about the crime. "I can't tell you something I know nothing about," he said. But an arrest warrant affidavit says otherwise. An informant told police that Murphy and another Blood gang member were selling drugs at the apartment complex where Chaz Gilley lived with his family. "They saw a 'white boy' looking at his check," the informant told police, and followed him to Wal-Mart "and waiting for him to cash his check." Police say security video from inside Wal-Mart shows two men shadowing Gilley and watching him count money. The video then shows Gilley departing the store on bicycle with the men following in a black car. According to the affidavit, the men used the car to knock him off his bike, and then they chased him and shot in multiple times as he tried to run away. The informant said that a few days later, they were "laughing and bragging" about the crime. "To go around bragging about it to other people," Markham said with tears in her eyes. Gilley flagged down help and was taken to the hospital, but doctors were not able to save him. "You took somebody's life.  It's not a joke, it's not a game," Markham said. "My son will never grow up. He'll never have a family." Now, Markham is determined that Murphy and Morgan pay. She vows that she'll be in the courtroom during any trial to come, and she wants them to face the death penalty for taking her son's life and then laughing about it. "To me, they're going to get it easy compared to what my son had," she said. "My son lived the last minutes of his life in fear and in pain."

And it’s not exactly a shock that they will both be opening at the same time. The goal here is to not allow the other one to open earlier to collect more revenue dollars. So if you are done with your Thanksgiving meal at 6pm, that is the exact time the doors will be opening for both big box stores. I have never gone shopping on Thanksgiving, I love the holiday too much, and the leftovers even after dinner. I have been shopping on Black Friday many times and I will probably do more of that this year but I just refuse to interrupt other peoples holiday so I can save a few dollars.

He’s gathered more than 1,300 names since just before last Veterans Day, almost all of them American military, but a few police officers and firefighters and members of the Mexican Army and Australian Air Force. He doesn’t have to ask. People are drawn to his 1946 Chevy Sedan Delivery and all of the autographs covering its olive green panels, and soon they’re selecting a spot to add their own.

Hood: Nelson O’Keefe Jr. USMC 1944-1955. Behind the rear wheel: A dozen members of the Johnson family. Driver’s door: RIP Robert Smith. One name is missing. His. Sam Aughe, 199th Light Infantry. “This isn’t about me,” he says. But it could be. * * * He and this car have a history. He first wanted it nearly 50 years ago, when he 17, before the Army sent him to Vietnam. “It was just different,” Aughe said. “It’s an ugly car, actually. So ugly, it’s neat.” It was the butcher’s car then. Tony Bohac would drive around Saline County making deliveries in the yellow Chevy, sometimes returning to Crete with a load of live hogs in the back. Aughe tried to buy it, but Bohac wasn’t selling. Then the teen enlisted in the Army. He had planned to make the military his career. The artilleryman was in his second year in Vietnam, lobbing shells into the jungle, when he was hit by the recoil of his howitzer. The force flipped him through the air and he landed on his back, upside down, against the blast wall. His career plans changed. “After I got hurt, the Army didn't want me. And I didn't want the Army, either.” He didn't return to a hero's homecoming then. He didn't feel any of the honor he's trying to bestow with his Chevy now. “I was asked: 'How many women and kids do you think you killed?'” Back in Crete, he married Dolores Coffey and they started a family. He worked for the city, and then as a lineman, and then for the co-op, fixing cars. He's retired now, but still works on cars for family and friends. Which is how he ended up at his old friend Fran Siedhoff's garage about two years ago. And how he was reunited with the '46 Sedan Delivery. “I went down there and there it was. I didn’t even know he had the damn thing. I told him I was interested.” Siedhoff had found the Chevy in a scrap yard. He recognized it as the butcher's, so he bought it, tracked down the title, swapped motors to get it running again – and then parked it for about 30 years, until Aughe stumbled upon it. “I just had it in storage and Sam wanted it, and I said, 'Fine.'” * * * The thought came to Sam Aughe during a sleepless night. He'd owned the car for a couple of weeks and had been planning its restoration: Fresh yellow paint, like it had looked when he first saw it in the late 1960s. But then this new thought from out of nowhere: Make it look military, make it honor those who served. So he covered it in Army olive, with a white star on each door. He painted the grille and fenders red, white and blue. He spent about 400 hours getting it road-worthy. He let his granddaughter christen it a year ago with the name of her other grandfather. Then the names multiplied -- people stopping him in parking lots to ask about the car, Aughe giving them the marker, and his invitation. A man signed for his father and uncle, both shot down over the same target on the same day, both ending up in the same prisoner-of-war camp. A woman honored her husband and brother, killed by the same IED in Iraq. Another told him her relative fought in the Civil War. “But she wasn't going to add it, and I said, 'Why not?' And she said, 'He fought for the Confederacy. And I said, 'I don't care.'” He's had state troopers sign it and federal agents. He's had members of foreign forces sign it. But mostly, he's handed his black markers to those who served all branches of the U.S. military, including the Coast Guard. They all leave their names, but some add where they served and when. Others sign for their loved ones who were killed in action or are still missing or have since died. He felt good, like his mission was accomplished, when an old vet signed the car and told him: “At least now I know my name will be on something other than a damn tombstone.” But Aughe plans to keep driving his Chevy and keep collecting signatures until he runs out of room. Then he'll give it to a military museum. That won't be anytime soon. The rolling memorial is more than 16 feet long, draped in what seems like an acre of sheet metal. Plenty of places for more names, more honor. “And I do have a lot of space inside, too.” Reach the writer at 402-473-7254 or psalter@journalstar.com.

Spending on Alibaba platforms, including Tmall, Taobao and Ali­Express, topped 120.7 billion yuan (US$17.8 billion), a 32 per cent rise on last year’s sales. More than 82 per cent of the sales were conducted through mobile devices, with purchases using smartphones 99 billion yuan, according to Alibaba’s live data. Launched in 2009, the day-long event held annually on November 11 is considered a benchmark for the country’s continuing swing towards online shopping, and is seen by economists as a bellwether of consumer demand. WATCH: Chinese spend 120.7 billion yuan on Singles’ Day as Alibaba reveals their new global strategy This year’s selling spree kicked off at midnight in Shenzhen with a gala event featuring a host of celebrities, including English football legend David Beckham, basketball star Kobe Bryant, actress Scarlett Johansson and rock band One Republic, to drum up international attention. There was an immediate wave of pre-orders that shoppers had placed ahead that propelled the first billion dollars of transactions in less than five minutes, said Alibaba, which also owns the South China Morning Post. Spending took place across the spectrum of retail goods, from soya sauce to shampoo. Singles’ Day has become an emerging billion-dollar battle ground for Alibaba and its chief rival JD.com in their hunt for new growth areas. The spending this year had also been expected to be higher partly because of the quality of goods being offered to attract the rising middle classes, who are thirsty for everything from sparkling water from Fiji to biscuits from Britain.   The anticipated fight for sales, particularly in the grocery segment, escalated three weeks ago in the lead-up to Singles’ Day, when Wal-Mart Stores said it set up a store in Beijing in a tie-up with JD to deliver imported goods to shoppers “within hours”. On the same day in Hong Kong, Alibaba brought into spotlight its alliance with Costco Wholesale, the largest warehouse retailer in the United States, as well as other grocery brands, such as Procter & Gamble, that were expected to be at the forefront of promotions, including offering steep discounts and products not yet available in China. The pacts with western consumer multinationals is just part of a multibillion-dollar campaign rolled out by Alibaba, which has vowed to outspend its rivals to gain an upper hand in the online grocery war.   This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Singles’ Day shopping frenzy breaks records with US$17.8b in sales   Most Popular Viewed 1 Modi’s key aide blames poor planning for India’s currency crisis 2 RIP: Hong Kong’s shopping industry, as e-retailers tighten their grip 3 China’s economy risks being washed aside by a Trump tsunami 4 Relaxed mainland port rules could slice 14pc off Hong Kong’s container throughput, says report 5 Trump’s America: the good, the bad and the ugly Shared 1 Modi’s key aide blames poor planning for India’s currency crisis 2 RIP: Hong Kong’s shopping industry, as e-retailers tighten their grip 3 Relaxed mainland port rules could slice 14pc off Hong Kong’s container throughput, says report 4 China’s economy risks being washed aside by a Trump tsunami 5 Chinese regulator bans futures brokers from providing margin financing Commented 1 Thousands turn out to decry Hong Kong independence 2 Beijing’s top man in Hong Kong accuses Legco localists of treating community like ‘idiots’ 3 Walking a mile in Beijing’s shoes could serve Hong Kong politicians well in future 4 Clinton blames FBI director for presidential election loss 5 Death of China’s first female J-10 fighter pilot Yu Xu sparks call for more training Promotions Register for a free copy of XXIV 2017 now Register for a free copy of Home Essentials 2017 now       You may also like China Pacific Rim nations urged to revise TPP without US before Trump cuts trade ties 12 Nov 2016 - 12:29am 15 Society Why China’s rise means Hong Kong stars like Jackie Chan will be the last of their kind 13 Nov 2016 - 7:23pm 14 Hong Kong Despite fears, new air traffic control system to be launched at Hong Kong airport on Monday 11 Nov 2016 - 11:26pm 3 Motoring choices, plug-in hybrid vehicles help to accelerate clean mobility In partnership with: HKT PREMIER Hong Kong Did CY Leung mess up his own oath?

Research Brief Key Findings Three-fourths of retail clinics are located in the Southern and Midwestern United States. Retail clinics typically serve younger adults who do not have a primary care provider. For a select group of conditions, retail clinics deliver care of equivalent quality compared with other settings. Availability of a retail clinic does not deter people from going to the emergency department. Though promoted as a means of decreasing health care spending, retail clinics slightly increase health care utilization and, consequently, health care spending. Retail clinics are medical clinics located in pharmacies, grocery stores, and "big box" stores, such as Target and Walmart. These clinics offer extended weekend and evening hours, walk-in availability, and short wait times. Many visits to retail clinics are in the evenings and weekends, when primary care offices are not available. The clinics treat a limited range of health conditions, such as minor infections and injuries, and provide vaccines and other preventive care. Care is delivered by a nurse practitioner or physician assistant. Prices are typically fixed and transparent. Retail clinics have been proposed as an alternative to costly emergency department care for nonemergency conditions. It has been estimated that up to 20 percent of emergency department visits for a nonemergency condition could take place at a retail clinic or urgent care center, potentially generating cost savings as high as $4.4 billion annually. Retail clinics are playing a steadily growing role in the health care marketplace. The first retail clinics opened in 2000; by 2010, they numbered close to 1,200. Recent estimates predict that there will be more than 2,800 clinics by 2017, nearly double the 2014 levels. Convenience, accessibility after hours, and clear pricing appear to be the most important drivers of growth. Consumers are relatively happy with their overall care experiences. But retail clinics have also generated controversy. Provider groups, such as the American Medical Association, have raised concerns about quality-of-care issues, including the overprescribing of antibiotics, lost opportunities for preventive care, and the disruption of existing patient-physician relationships. Conversely, champions of the retail clinic model have pointed to their potential benefits: Retail clinics may function as a provider for lower-income patients and those without a primary care physician and could also provide a less costly alternative for patients who otherwise would go to emergency departments. By replacing more expensive emergency department visits, the hope is that retail clinics may decrease health care spending. To provide a factual basis for assessing retail clinics, RAND Health researchers conducted a series of studies focusing on four areas: A profile of retail clinics: Where are retail clinics located, what services do they offer, and who owns them? Patient characteristics and service use: Who uses retail clinics, and what services do patients obtain? Quality and delivery of preventive care: How do retail clinics compare on these dimensions with other health care settings? Costs: How do retail clinic costs compare with the cost of services in a physician's office or in an emergency department? Are there potential savings if retail clinic visits can substitute for more expensive care in other venues? Figure 1. Figure 1. U.S. Retail Clinics Are Concentrated in the Southern and Midwestern United States SOURCE: Data from Martsolf et al., 2016. Most Retail Clinics Operate in the Southern and Midwestern United States in Large Metropolitan Areas RAND analysis of 2014 data shows that the vast majority (74 percent) of the 2,737 retail clinics in the nation were located in the South and Midwest (Figure 1). More than a third of all clinics were located in five states (California, Florida, Illinois, Minnesota, and Texas). These results largely echo prior RAND research on retail clinic locations. That work used cross-sectional data from industry and foundation sources to analyze the characteristics of 982 retail clinics operating in the United States (as of August 2008). RAND's analyses revealed the following findings. Geographic Distribution About 35 percent of the U.S. urban population lived within a ten-minute driving distance of a retail clinic. Retail clinics tended to be located in higher-income urban and suburban settings, with higher concentrations of white residents and fewer black and Hispanic residents. Only 12.5 percent were located in medically underserved areas. For comparison, 21 percent of the U.S. population lives in such areas. Even after adjusting for the location of pharmacies and supermarket chains, clinics were less likely to be located in medically underserved neighborhoods than in other areas. Services Clinics offered treatment for a limited set of conditions for which they had treatment protocols, including acute respiratory infections — which accounted for 60 percent of all retail clinic visits — other minor illnesses, immunizations, sports physicals, and screening services, such as lipid or diabetes screening. The majority of retail clinics accepted commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid coverage, and all accepted cash payment, regardless of insurance status. Ownership Two organizations — CVS and Walgreens — operated about three-quarters of all retail clinics. Adding clinics operated by Kroger, Walmart, Target, and RiteAid accounted for 93 percent of retail clinics nationwide. Note that, as of 2016, Target's clinics are operated by CVS. Typical Retail Clinic Patients Are Younger Adults with No Regular Provider Who uses retail clinics, and why? RAND researchers analyzed details of more than 1.3 million visits to retail clinics from 2000 to 2007 and compared information from that analysis with national data on visits to primary care physician offices and emergency departments. According to the study's findings: The largest group of clinic users was young adults, age 18–44, who accounted for 43 percent of patients. Nationally, this group made up only 23 percent of patients who visited primary care physicians. Only about one-third of clinic users said that they had a primary care physician. Two-thirds of retail clinic visits were paid for with health insurance, compared with 90 percent of visits to primary care physicians. About 90 percent of visits to retail clinics were for preventive care and for ten simple acute conditions: upper respiratory infections, sinusitis, bronchitis, sore throat, immunizations, inner ear infections, swimmer's ear, conjunctivitis, urinary tract infections, and blood tests. The same conditions accounted for 18 percent of visits to primary care physician offices and 12 percent of emergency department visits. Retail Clinics Offer Comparable Quality of Care for Some Medical Conditions Critics of retail clinics are concerned that they offer sub-standard care and that using a retail clinic disrupts patient-physician relationships. The evidence suggests otherwise: Quality of care: RAND analysts evaluated claims data from enrollees in a large Minnesota health plan who received care for one of three common conditions: otitis media (inflammation of the middle ear), pharyngitis (sore throat), or urinary tract infection. Based on 12 quality-of-care measures, retail clinics, physician offices, and urgent care centers had similar quality ratings; quality scores were lower for emergency departments. Antibiotic prescribing: Acute respiratory infections, such as bronchitis and rhinosinusitis, are the most common reason that patients seek care in the United States and account for 60 percent of all retail clinic visits. Physicians often overprescribe antibiotics for these conditions, and experts were concerned that overprescribing would be even more frequent in retail clinics. The research did not support this concern. Using data from the medical records of physician offices, retail clinics, and emergency departments, researchers found that the share of patients who were prescribed antibiotics was similar for retail clinics, physician offices, and emergency departments. In fact, care at retail clinics was more guideline-concordant. For such conditions as bronchitis, for which antibiotics are never indicated, retail clinics had a lower antibiotic prescribing rate than physician offices. Vaccinations: Retail clinics have been viewed as a promising venue for administering vaccinations. A study examined how many vaccinations were delivered at the largest retail clinic chains from 2007 through 2009, what percentage of clinic visits included vaccinations, and which vaccinations were the most common. In the time period studied, vaccinations were administered in about 40 percent of visits; the most common vaccination was for influenza. Those receiving vaccinations were typically not "outside the medical system" but instead may have chosen to receive a vaccination at the retail clinic because it was more convenient than the doctor's office. Retail clinics could deliver more vaccinations if they counseled patients during acute care visits about the benefits of vaccinations. Continuity of care: Some physician groups have expressed concerns that using retail clinics will disrupt existing patient-physician relationships. However, multiple studies have found that the majority of retail clinic patients report not having a primary care provider. Retail clinics seem to be serving a population that does not seek care in a doctor's office but might otherwise seek care in emergency departments. Retail clinics might reduce the likelihood that a patient will go to a primary care physician first for a new condition and decrease subsequent continuity of care. However, patients who visit retail clinics appear just as likely to receive preventive care or proper management of diabetes. Retail Clinics Increase Both Health Care Use and Health Care Spending Policymakers and insurers have viewed retail clinics as a way to decrease health care spending: Less expensive care for low-acuity conditions, such as bronchitis and urinary tract infections, in a retail clinic could substitute for more expensive care in a physician's office or an emergency department. However, RAND research has not supported this idea. A recent study compared emergency departments with a retail clinic nearby to emergency departments with no retail clinic nearby. There was no notable reduction in visits for minor conditions to the emergency departments in close proximity to retail clinics. More broadly, the key to cost savings from retail clinics is substitution. Retail clinics generate cost savings only if less expensive clinic visits substitute for more costly care from physicians or emergency departments. On the other hand, retail clinic visits could also increase costs if they generate new health care use by patients seeking care when they otherwise would have stayed home. To gauge substitution versus new utilization, RAND followed two groups of enrollees — users and nonusers of retail clinics — among 1.3 million Aetna enrollees in 22 cities in 2010 and 2011. The groups had similar low-acuity conditions. Figure 2. Increased Utilization in Health Care Clinics Partially Offsets Savings SOURCE: Ashwood et al., 2016. Researchers found that about two-fifths of retail clinic visits for these conditions were substitutions for physician office or emergency department visits. The other three-fifths of clinic visits reflected new utilization, not substitution (see Figure 2). Given that retail clinics focus on making it easy to access care, it is not surprising that some individuals who might have done nothing about their condition sought care for it because it was convenient. The costs of the new health care utilization more than offset the savings from substitution (Figure 2). There was a relatively small net increase in patient spending ($14 per person per year). Many payers are including retail clinics in their provider networks and encouraging enrollees to use them. To the extent that the provider's goal is to reduce health care spending, encouraging retail clinic use might not be effective. Summary and Implications RAND's body of work substantially strengthened understanding of the patients served by retail clinics, the quality of the care that those patients receive, and the clinics' net cost effects: Younger adults and those without a regular care provider are typical users of retail clinics. Overall, retail clinics are not improving access to care for the medically underserved; retail clinics are more likely to be located in relatively affluent sections of large urban areas. Retail clinics provide care that is of equivalent quality to the care provided by physician offices and emergency departments. Retail clinics have not led to any substantive decline in emergency department visits. More than half of clinic visits for low-acuity conditions represented new health care utilization. As a result, contrary to expectations, retail clinics increased health care spending per person per year.

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | November 11, 2016 -- 00:22 GMT (16:22 PST) | Topic: Hardware Walmart's Black Friday ad includes an Apple iPad mini 2 sale and $119 Chromebook deal. The Black Friday ad wars are finally starting to heat up, with Walmart's ad surfacing shortly after Target's. Like its rival, it has more tablet deals than ads leaked earlier in the cycle -- including Apple's iPad -- along with specials on several low-cost laptops. While Target has three different iPad models on sale, Walmart just has one -- not surprisingly, the Apple's cheapest model. The iPad mini 2 is discounted to $199, 79 cents less than what Target is going to be offering it for. Walmart makes up for it with a number of Android tablet specials, including a 7-inch RCA for just $28. It also has the Samsung Galaxy Tab E Lite 7-inch slate for $69 (99 cents lower than at Staples, with a $10 Google Play thrown in) and the Lenovo Tab 10 model for $99 ($50 off the regular price). Black Friday 2016 CNET 2016 Holiday Gift Guide Hhgregg ad has 12.9-inch iPad Pro deal Office Depot/OfficeMax ad features $119 Windows 2-in-1 tablet, $169 HP laptop Best Buy ad reveals $100 Windows laptop deal, $125 iPad Air 2, Pro savings Walmart ad features $199 Apple iPad mini 2, $119 Chromebook deals Target ad has iPad Pro for $449, iPad Air 2 for $274 HP ad leaks with PC deals from $250 Staples ad leaks with laptops, tablet deals Costco ad leaks with laptop, desktop, tablet deals Ads for Dell Small Business leak BJ's Wholesale ad features $33.33 Amazon Fire tablet Sam's Club ad leaks with HP laptop, desktop deals Dell's ad leaks with $100 laptop, desktop deals Also listed are a trio of tablets with bundled wireless keyboards, including a RCA Cambio 10.1-inch device that runs Windows 10 for $99, though that's only about $10 less than the current price on the Walmart website. There are a pair of Android 2-in-1 deals in the form of a 10.1-inch SmarTab with Intel Atom processor for $72, and a 11.5-inch RCA Galileo Pro for $98. Given their surging popularity, Chromebooks have been largely unseen in Black Friday ads thus far. Walmart has one, however, at a low price of $119. For that price ($60 less than Samsung is currently selling it for online), the Samsung Chromebook 3 gives you an Intel Celeron N3050 processor, 4GB of RAM, 16GB of built-in storage, and a 11.6-inch display. If you want a cheap Windows 10 laptop instead, you'll have to pay a bit more ($199) for the HP 15-ba018wm with AMD E2-7110 processor, 4 gigs of RAM, 500GB hard drive, and 15.6-inch display. Walmart has three additional budget notebook listed in Black Friday ad, each with a 15.6-inch displays. These include the HP 15-f222wm with an Intel Pentium N3540 CPU, 4GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, and touchscreen for $249, and an Acer laptop with Intel Core i5 chip, 6GB of memory, and 1TB hard drive for $299. Finally, for a little more ($349), there's the HP 15-ba051wm with AMD A10-9600P processor, 8GB of RAM, terabyte hard drive, and choice of chassis color, along with a wireless mouse, 16GB flash drive, and a sleeve included in the price.

'As he was leaving, he was saying that I and our baby that I am pregnant with have to die,' she told police in the application for the court order. 'He has grabbed me by my neck in an attempt to kill me.' Scroll down for video  History of violence: Suspect Michael Cwiklinski (pictured left) died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after he allegedly opened fire on two officers and killed his pregnant wife, Dalia Sabae (right), after she had obtained an order of protection against him  Police vehicles line streets of the Canonsburg, Pennsylvania neighborhood where two Canonsburg police officers were shot when they responded to a domestic call early Thursday Law enforcement personnel gather after the shooting where offices were 'ambushed', authorities said Sabae, a pharmacy worker and an expectant mother, went to stay at an emergency shelter after her latest confrontation with her husband, but she returned home after a few days.  When her husband were served with papers related to the restraining order, investigators believe he snapped, grabbed a long rifle and drove to Sabae's home.   Cwiklinski shot two Canonsburg police officers who responded to a report that the couple were fighting early Thursday, killing one of them. Cwiklinski and Sabae were later found dead, the man of a self-inflicted wound. His wife was three months pregnant at the time of her death.  Officer Scott Bashioum, 52, a seven-year veteran officer and married father of four, died at a hospital. Officer James Saieva underwent emergency surgery Thursday and was listed in stable condition Friday.  Hundreds gathered at the borough building Thursday evening. A military memorial already festooned with American flags for Veterans Day had also become a memorial for Bashioum, as people dropped off flowers, stuffed animals, signs and other mementos. An electric message sign blinked with the words, 'Please keep Scott Bashioum and his family in your thoughts' and 'Godspeed to our injured officer.' State police said Cwiklinski ambushed the officers, essentially waiting for them to arrive and opening fire even immediately. The fact that Cwiklinski 'laid in wait and fire upon the officers as they arrived speaks for itself,' state police Capt. David Heckman said.  The surviving officer, who was reportedly shot in the stomach, was flown to a hospital in Pittsburgh. His name has not been released, but he is currently in intensive care at Allegheny General Hospital with injuries not believed to be life-threatening After shooting the officers, Cwiklinkski ran from the scene and a manhunt ensued. Following a six-hour search, officials confirmed Thursday morning that Dalia Sabae and Cwiklinski were found dead inside the home, according to KDKA. Cwiklinski, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, reportedly shot the woman, who was three months pregnant, and eventually turned the gun on himself. Attorney David Wolf said he had known the couple since November 2015, when Cwiklinski was charged with simple assault and harassment for swinging a bag of groceries, reportedly containing 'heavy cans', and hitting Sabae in the eye outside a Walmart. Following that incident, Sabae filed a protection from abuse order, describing how her husband attacked her with the grocery bag after she offered to help him carry it, reported KDKA. That case was eventually resolved with the assault charge being dropped and Cwiklinski pleading guilty to harassment. He was sentenced to anger management classes and required to have a mental health evaluation, Wolf said. The attorney added that he had encouraged Sabae to get another protection order and said Cwiklinski was there when he ran into the couple at the county courthouse. Cwiklinski and Sabae, an Egyptian citizen, had met online, Wolf said.  In June, Cwiklinski was cited for harassment in connection with another dispute with his wife, according to the Observer-Reporter.  The slain police officer has been identified as 52-year-old Scott Leslie Bashioum (left). Surviving Officer James Saieva (right) is listed in stable condition after surgery Leslie Bashioum, a father of four, was pronounced dead at Canonsburg Hospital shortly after 4am, less than an hour after the shooting, the Washington County coroner said.  James Saieva, the surviving officer who was reportedly shot in the stomach, was flown to a hospital in Pittsburgh, county Coroner Tim Warco said. He was listed in stable condition after surgery at Allegheny General Hospital. Trooper Melinda Bondarenka told reporters the officers were immediately met with gunfire when they arrived at the scene just after 3am Thursday. 'Upon their arrival, the two officers were ambushed,' Bonderanka said. 'They were shot with an unknown type of firearm.' Bashioum and the other officer were responding separately to the 911 call from neighbors when they were 'ambushed upon their arrival' and immediately shot, Bondarenka said. Cwiklinski was charged with simple assault and harassment for swinging a bag of merchandise and hitting Sabae (left and right) in the eye outside a Walmart in November. She was reportedly three months pregnant The officers had arrived almost simultaneously, though authorities said other details of the initial confrontation were not immediately clear.  A firefighter responding to the scene told KDKA that when the shooting started, one of the officers was 'bleeding badly.'  'The shooter had everyone pinned down when they were trying to get him. I don't know where he was shot,' the firefighter said.  Police were seen near at least two homes in the borough about 20 miles southwest of Pittsburgh. A SWAT team was also on the scene and a police helicopter was patrolling overhead during their search for the suspect. Earlier in the morning as authorities searched for the suspect, homes in the Woodcrest Drive area were evacuated while residents in the surrounding area were warned to stay in their homes. It is understood one officer has died following this morning's shooting on Woodcrest Drive. A pregnant woman inside the home has also died During the manhunt for the suspect, residents had been warned to stay in their homes The Canon-McMillan School District canceled classes on Thursday because of the heavy police presence Authorities said the duplex may have been 'booby-trapped' but declined to provide details. Gas cans were reportedly found inside the house and inside the suspect's car, according to WPXI. KDKA reported, citing unnamed sources, that Cwiklinski packed his vehicle with gas cans and propane tanks, and opened fire on the car, trying to blow it up, but his plan failed.  The bomb squad from neighboring Allegheny County was called to safeguard the scene before police entered and found the couple dead, police said.    Angela Kelly, of Strabane, places flowers in front of the Canonsburg Municipal Building in honor of the officers shot on Thursday   Share or comment on this article e-mail 38 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Pres.

Back then, it was all about the Black Friday midnight madness. We went back in our archives to remember what Black Friday was like in the ’90s. There was a big crowd at Walmart in Kunia at midnight. You didn’t have the option to order online and pick your purchase up later. Liberty House was still at at Ala Moana Center. Remember KB Toys? But deep down, decades later, the hype and hate for one of the biggest shopping days of the year hasn’t changed. “We’ve only been to Liberty House so we’ve got to walk the rest of the mall,” said one shopper. When asked how much longer she plans to shop, she replied with a laugh, “Maybe another five, six hours, maybe till 9 o’clock.” “She’s in Liberty House spending all my money, but I came along to make sure she doesn’t go over the credit limit,” said an (unwilling) shopper. “I was supposed to be at the golf course, but I had to cancel my tee time.” Another thing that hasn’t changed is parking. It’s still a pain trying to find a spot.

Gray Thursday. Whether it leaves you tickled pink or seeing red, the preeminent shopper's holiday will once again ooze into Thanksgiving Thursday. But the retail bleed won't stop there. "A few years ago, the biggest threat to Black Friday was Thanksgiving," says Eric Jones, co-founder of BestBlackFriday.com, a deal tracking site showcasing "leaked" retail advertisement scans, sales analyses and superior deals. "While Thanksgiving remains a worthy foe, both days are now in danger of losing consumer spending to 'Black November,' which is an entire month of sales that bear the 'Black Friday' name in some fashion." More Information Most major retailers, like Walmart and Target, began touting pre-Black Friday sales, early doorbuster deals and one-day-only steals weeks ago. "Black Friday prices will be available earlier than ever this year," says Jones and you can expect some Black Friday events to begin before Thanksgiving Day and last through Cyber Monday. The spending may spread, and it may be possible to complete a lot of your November shopping before Thanksgiving, but nothing will trump the deals you can nab on Turkey Day, says Jones. Like last year, doors at most major retailers will swing open before you've had a second helping of pumpkin pie. Bad news for bargain-hunters who would rather drift into a tryptophan-induced slumber. "Many shoppers do not like stores being open on Thanksgiving, but it is an important day to shop if their goal is to save the most money possible," says Jones. "The major retailers will continue to offer their absolute best doorbusters on Turkey Day, so it is really a requirement at this point." Dogged deal hunters may not need to rush to scrub the dishes and head to the brick-and-mortar stores for the best doorbusters, though. A slew of retailers started offering the most coveted products online last year, and will likely do so again, with a few exceptions. "Certain retailers — notably Kohl's — did not offer their top doorbusters online last year," says Jones. "Some stores will continue to be stubborn, but that is now the exception, as opposed to the rule." What else can shoppers expect this holiday season? Three of my favorite sale-scouring sources — BestBlackFriday.com, Bfads.net and BlackFriday.com — offer these predictions: • 1: Sales on Thanksgiving and Black Friday are going to be well into the billions this year. On Turkey Day, shoppers will spend an estimated $2.07 billion online and $1.58 billion in stores. As for Black Friday, shoppers will likely spend $3.08 billion online and $9.2 billion in stores. • 2: Thanksgiving weekend shoppers will have access to more than 52,000 advertised Black Friday deals (49,000 in 2015), including 15,000 deals under $20. • 3: Expect a record 7,000 Black Friday doorbusters with more available online and via mobile device than ever before. • 4: To compete for your attention, stores will offer an increased number of store exclusive products — especially toys — and bundle deals on electronics that include gift cards and special accessories. • 5: The price on popular 4K HDTVs will continue to slide with many models priced below $500. Expect off-brand, 32-inch standard televisions to be priced below $100. • 6: A low-end laptop should start at around $90 this year. Most average laptop door busters will be around $150. If you are looking for an actual quality laptop, it is going to cost around $350. • 7: Expect 1,500 video game deals with more than 500 under $20, $200 Xbox One bundles, $300 PS4 bundles and new Xbox One S bundles at $300 and PS4 Pro bundles at $400. • 8: The best prices for toys are in December — specifically the middle two weeks — but Black Friday still has some solid deals. Shoppers should be aware that the current toy book sales do not have great prices, so they should avoid them. While Toys "R" Us is known for their toys, Belk, JCPenney, and Kohl's actually had higher average discounts on toys last year. • 9: Amazon will offer its Kindle Fire for $35, Fire Sticks for $20 and Kindle Fire Kid's Tablets for less than $60. Also, look for smart home devices like the NEST, Amazon Echo and wireless WiFi home security systems at their lowest prices of the year. • 10: The new Apple iPhone 7 will be offered with significant signup bonuses such as store gift cards, free accessories or no money down.

(ABC7 File photo) 0shares   tweet now! 0shares   tweet now! WASHINGTON(ABC7) — Traditionally, Thanksgiving has always been about turkey, pumpkin pie, football and spending time with family. However in recent years, shopping for deals has become a new Thanksgiving Day tradition. Retailers started opening on Thanksgiving to maximize profits by giving shoppers looking for big sales and door-buster deals, deeper discounts than what could be found on Black Friday. However in recent years, many retailers across the country have decided to reverse this trend by encouraging employees to spend time with their families by keeping their doors closed on Thanksgiving Day. TheBlackFriday.com is reporting that so far this year, 52 retailers including Costco, Home Depot, Ikea, Crate & Barrel, BJs, Nordstrom, REI, and TJ Maxx will be closed on Thanksgiving. According to Nerd Wallet, the beginnings of “Gray Thursday” started in 2006 when Walmart, Target, Toys R Us and Best Buy opened their doors at 5 a.m. on Black Friday. Then in 2009, Toy R Us was the first major retailer to open at midnight on Black Friday. But it wasn’t until 2012, that the concept of “Gray Thursday” was born, when major retailers Walmart and Target decided to stay open for 24 hours on Thanksgiving. Along with the introduction of “Gray Thursday,” Thanksgiving weekend has become a major shopping weekend for shoppers as they not only got deals on “Black Friday” but on “Small Business Saturday” and “Cyber Monday.” Due to “Blue Laws,” stores in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Maine are required by law to close all of their stores on Thanksgiving. Here is the list of retailers that will be closed on Thanksgiving: A.C. Moore (Allow employees to spend time with family) American Girl AT&T (Customer Service Closed; Select Retail Locations Closed) Bed Bath & Beyond (Select Locations) BJ’s Wholesale Club Burlington (Allow employees to spend time with family) Cabela’s (Retail closed; Call Centers Open) Christmas Tree Shops (Select Locations) Costco Crate and Barrel Dillard’s (Allow employees to spend time with family) GameStop (5 a.m. Black Friday opening) Gardner-White Furniture (8 a.m. Black Friday opening) Guitar Center Hobby Lobby Home Depot HomeGoods (Allow employees to spend time with family) IKEA Jo-Ann Fabric & Craft Stores Lowe’s Mall of America Marshalls (Allow employees to spend time with family) Mattress Firm Menards Neiman Marcus Nordstrom (non-store employees working ) Outdoor Research P.C.

Many of the nation’s major mall operators and the big retailers that anchor them, such as Toys R Us, J.C. Penney, and Macy’s, are sticking with what they want to be a new tradition, kicking off the holiday shopping season on Thanksgiving Day. Others, including the Mall of America, the nation’s largest shopping mall, are closing for Thanksgiving this year after being open for the past several years. Some retailers that are closing cite respect for the holiday, but in truth the cost of being open may be more than the return. “Once you let the genie out of the bottle, it’s hard,” said Stephen D. Lebovitz, president and CEO of CBL & Associates Properties, a mall operator that is closing 72 of its malls for the day. “More retailers are coming to their senses and realizing it is a family holiday and from a business point of view, it’s not making much business sense.” Stores being open on Thanksgiving started in earnest in 2011 and took a punch out of sales on Black Friday, which had usually launched the shopping season. Many places like Macy’s, Target and J.C. Penney have been opening earlier and earlier on Thanksgiving as they try to outdo others to get first dibs on customers who could easily buy online. But the move has been controversial, as many workers have voiced complaints that stores are putting profits over workers’ time to be with their families. Some 89 of the 145 properties that Chattanooga, Tennessee-based CBL owns or has interest in opened at 6 p.m. on the holiday last year. While dozens of those will be closed this year, the department stores, movie theaters, restaurants and retailers with exterior entrances have the option to open on Thanksgiving. Other retailers including Office Depot and consumer electronics chain hhgregg Inc. plan to be closed after being open for the past several years. Plenty of retailers, particularly high-end stores like Nordstrom or those like T.J. Maxx that offer discounts every day, never opened on Thanksgiving and have collected goodwill because of that. In reality, analysts say, it’s all about stealing share in a market that isn’t growing that much. For department stores, the competition is fierce. Last year, J.C. Penney opened at 3 p.m. for the first time, three hours earlier than its rivals Kohl’s and Macy’s. That may have hurt Macy’s, which had a weak holiday season and aims to reverse a sales slump. This year, Macy’s decided to open an hour earlier at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving. Penney is sticking to 3 p.m., while Kohl’s will be opening again at 6 p.m. Most Sears stores will be open on Thanksgiving for the fourth year in a row, starting at 6 p.m. — the same as a year ago. Best Buy, the nation’s largest consumer electronics chain, suffered over Thanksgiving weekend in 2012 because it didn’t open until midnight, while stores like Wal-Mart and Target began their sales earlier in the evening. Wal-Mart, Target and Best Buy have not announced their plans for this Thanksgiving weekend. But all indications are they’ll start the doorbuster sales on the holiday. For many big retailers, covering expenses like paying employees holiday pay is not that costly, said Joel Bines, a managing director at retail consulting group AlixPartners. But for small stores or those with specialized merchandise, it may make more sense to close. AlixPartners also found for that some retailers who did open on Thanksgiving were simply pulling Friday sales a day earlier and their profit margins took a hit. Bob Riesbeck, president and CEO of hhgregg, says business on Thanksgiving actually declined over the previous two years when it opened at 4 p.m. CBL’s Lebovitz says when he surveyed stores in the company’s malls this year before deciding to close, the reaction was “overwhelmingly positive,” particularly with the specialty stores. The big anchors plan to stay open. Last year, the reaction was different. Most of the specialty stores wanted to be open. “They didn’t have enough data” to make the decision,” he said. Andy Mantis, executive vice president of NPD Group Checkout Tracking, says stores should open on both Thanksgiving and Black Friday to maximize their sales. The company, which analyzes receipt data to understand consumer behavior, found that the share of buyers who shopped on both days declined, while the number who shopped only on Thanksgiving Day or on Black Friday increased. Mantis believes specialty retailers, especially those near big stores like Macy’s that are open, should think again about whether to stay closed. “It is a heavy promotion time,” Mantis said. “People are buying, and they’re not always willing to go to multiple stores.” Doug Hanneman Follow Doug Hanneman Close Get email notifications on Doug Hanneman daily!

Amid the clutter of deals clamoring for attention, smart and careful shoppers can come out ahead. Many stores are increasing their inventory so as not to frustrate shoppers. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is increasing the number of products for online orders by 50 percent for the holiday kickoff compared to a year ago. "Start researching and planning," says Benjamin Glaser, features editor with DealNews.com, a deal comparison website. Click ahead for four ways to get the most out of Black Friday weekend — and beyond. 1. Study up © Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg      Make a comprehensive list of what you plan to buy, research what those items usually sell for at full price and on sale, and figure out how much you want to spend. Also check out store fliers from previous years online, since many retailers repeat the same deals at the same price. Eighty percent of the products and 43 percent of the prices highlighted on the front pages of the 2015 and 2014 Black Friday fliers of Best Buy, Macy's, Target, Kohl's, Walmart and J.C. Penney were the same, says Market Track LLC, a price tracking firm. Make sure to note at what times different stores plan to start their Black Friday deals — both online and at the store. For example, J.C. Penney is making its deals available on its website on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving for the first time. It will open its doors on Thanksgiving at 3 p.m., the same time as last year. Kohl's offered last Thursday a subset of the Black Friday deals that will be available for Thanksgiving, when it opens its doors at 6 p.m. For the first time, it will offer "doorbusters" online starting on Thanksgiving while supplies last. In the past, doorbusters were only at the store. Wal-Mart and Target will again start their sales at their stores at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving, the same as last year. Best Buy will open its doors at 5 p.m., also the same. And they'll all offer their deals earlier that day online. Wal-Mart's will begin at 12:01 a.m. on Thanksgiving, earlier than last year. Target says that starting this Wednesday through this Thursday, its Black Friday early access sale will allow customers to shop a selection of Black Friday deals on its website; new this year, shoppers can get them in all stores via its Cartwheel savings app. 2. Look at the whole season © The Associated Press     Retailers have been starting to spread their offers out, with some starting well before Thanksgiving and Black Friday. Earlier this month, Wal-Mart and Amazon.com both kicked off holiday deals on thousands of items. Still, there's a good chance you can get a better deal on Thanksgiving for certain items. DealNews.com says 38 percent of the specials pushed on the holiday were what the site considered top deals, compared to only 31 percent for Black Friday. But not every deal is the best on Thanksgiving. DealNews.com says it's likely better to buy cameras, TVs, tablets and major appliances on Thanksgiving, and tools on Black Friday. On the Monday after Thanksgiving, known as Cyber Monday, is also a good day for shoppers to get deep discounts on clothing and laptops. Traci Gregorski, senior vice president of marketing at Market Track, says that Monday is also a good time to buy laptops, small appliances and toys and games, based on an analysis of more than 1,400 listings across Amazon, Best Buy, Kmart, Sears, Target and Wal-Mart. "It's to the shoppers' benefit to do their homework to ensure they are getting the best deal," Gregorski said. 3. Use apps and rewards © Walmart     Strategize how to leverage the store rewards points you already have or holiday bonus offers. Look for the apps that work well for you. For example, Flipp recreates the traditional print fliers experience so you don't have to sift through all the weekly store fliers  — and not just on Black Friday. DealNews Black Friday keeps track of specials throughout the holiday season too. Plenty of retailer apps offer customers special discounts. Customers who use the Staples app will have gotten a sneak peek of the Black Friday deals, which started Sunday, and will be able to see the latest specials throughout the season. And Wal-Mart is making its Black Friday circular available starting this Thursday through its app. 4. Think past the holidays © Ron Antonelli/Bloomberg     If you don't need items by the holiday — or aren't seeing some friends and relatives until afterward, shoppers might do better waiting to buy toys and clothing like sweaters and coats until the end of the season. That lets them take advantage of clearance sales, says Glaser. For clothing, discounts are on average of 40 percent over the Thanksgiving weekend, but at the end of the season, they go to 70 percent.

Word that a Jimmy John’s was opening in Payson began in the summer of 2015 when a coming-soon sign was posted on a fence by an empty lot south of Walmart. Those plans never came to fruition reportedly due to issues with roadway improvements. On Tuesday, Election Day, the Payson Jimmy John’s finally opened its doors in the former location of Cousins Subs, 303 E. Highway 260. More than half a dozen workers were busy making subs Tuesday as word quickly spread around town. Jimmy John’s claims to fame include its French bread, made daily and usually less than four hours old; and its speedy delivery. Manager Zach Knight said bread makers are in by 5 a.m. While the store officially opens at 11 a.m., they usually unlock the doors much earlier, sometimes at 8 or 9 a.m., or whenever the bread is ready. The store also begins taking orders as early as 9:30 a.m. Delivery costs $1 per sub. The delivery area includes most of Payson, from Payson High School east to Tyler Parkway and Airport Road south to Green Valley Parkway.

The country mice got their cheese. The town mice are afraid for their children's futures. Steelworker Glen Bailey and his wife are looking forward to how Trump will help their pocketbooks. Courtesy of Glen Bailey "It's gonna be a good Christmas," said 44-year-old Indiana steel worker Glen Bailey. He's already planning on taking his wife on their first cruise, thanks to his candidate winning. His company gives out stock bonuses during the holidays. Shares jumped 28 percent the day after Trump was elected. Exit polls show that while Hillary Clinton won 59 percent of large cities, Trump won 62 percent of small city or rural areas. Where consumers lived determined how the election broke and how they felt their own bottom line would be impacted. Gary Burtless, an economist at the left-leaning Brookings Institution, said it would "ding consumer pocketbooks" if Trump succeeds in building a tariff wall against Mexico and China — or a physical wall to keep out immigrants — leading to higher prices and fewer shoppers.

If we slap 40 percent tariffs on them, we'll pay more," said Burtless. "If we have a smaller number of immigrants, that will also boost the prices of goods and services that U.S. consumers buy," by making it harder to supply cheap labor, he told NBC News. But in Trump country, the mood is jubilant. Galvanized steelworkers Bailey didn't vote for the President-elect's social rhetoric, as "some things you think but don't say," but rather the manufacturing boost. He hopes Trump will stop "gangster" Chinese from dumping cheap poor quality steel on the market, cut his taxes, and repeal Obamacare; but he also acknowledged the challenges Trump faces in enacting his vision. "Mr. Trump will have to deliver on his promises," said Bailey. "If he doesn't, he's going to be remembered as a dumpster fire." Hopeful farmers On his way to pick strawberries and castrate some pigs, Brandon Whitt, 37, said he hoped Trump will help him hand down his Tennessee family farm to the ninth generation. Brandon Whitt with Mary, his 2nd eldest of four children. He hopes Trump will open up more opportunities for farmers like himself. Courtesy of Brandon Whitt "We need those American-made products," he said. He's hoping for relief on the death tax and a curbing of EPA regulations so that his 2,400-acre farm can afford to keep raising hogs and growing soybeans, wheat, and small grains he sells locally and on the global market. But Whitt didn't vote for Trump. Refusing to choose between the "lesser of two evils" he "voted with his heart" and wrote in John Kasich. Still he said he is "extremely pleased" with the final election results. "I saw a rural America, blue-collar, hat-wearing Americans that get out and work with their hands that stood up and expressed themselves," said Whitt. "We gathered in churches and communities all across the countryside and we voted for what we thought provided a better opportunity for our families and our country as a whole." He hopes for more available and affordable loans for farmers, competitive trade deals, and closer ties between the urban and agricultural worlds. "I walked into an 8th grade job fair last Friday and one of the first questions I got was from a girl who asked why I didn't wear overalls," said Whitt. "There's a huge disconnect." Disappointed mothers Bridging the gap between farmers and cities isn't as much a priority for Kimberly Coerr, a 47-year-old single mother and marketing professional from Maclean, Virginia whose ex-husband is a Marine Corps officer. She said she's worried about her 401(k), and for her three boys, ages 11, 12 and 16. Single mother Kimberly Coerr said she's less worried about kitchen table issue and more about about explaining Trump's behavior to her kids who think he's "funny." Courtesy of Kimberly Coerr "I do worry he's going to be a destabilizing factor for the economy," she said of Trump. "That means working longer than I would want to for my retirement age, or not being as secure." While she won't turn down a tax cut, she says she knows that tax cuts generally benefit the wealthy and powerful. And she's not excited about the talk of deregulating the banks or rolling back consumer protections. Trump has promised to repeal the Dodd-Frank act put into place after the 2008 financial crisis. The act prohibits commercial banks from making investments bets with their own deposits, created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and other regulatory reform to prevent banks from imploding so destructively. "Released from restrictions they can put us in another case where banks can run rampant and fail and hurt us all over again," said Coerr.

Caregiver Dianne Louis fears for her family's wages and immigration status. BA Photography / Courtesy Dianne Louis Dianne Louis, a 49-year-old nanny, arrived in Brooklyn, New York, from the Caribbean 26 years ago with a grant and aspirations to be a model. But when she got here the agencies were asking for too much money up front to get started. So she gave up and started working in childcare. Now she's worried about being deported. Though she pays taxes, she says she's not "fully" documented and one of her sons is enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Passed by Obama, It allows certain children who entered the country before they were 16 and before 2010 to get a 2-year work permit and be exempt from deportation. Trump has promised to roll back the policy. And while the president-elect's immigration rhetoric has largely focused on Hispanics and Muslims, Louis said she's not waiting around for Trump to get to immigrants like her sons, who are in school but who contribute to the household income with part-time jobs. "I will not let them deport him," said Louis. "We are already thinking ahead... we gotta ship our stuff, gotta buy airline tickets..."

So their plan is to give Trump a year and, "if things are terrible just quit and go back home." In a couple of years when her boys are old enough to be on their own, "they could move back," she said, and the next generation could give the American Dream another shot. "That's what's going to have to be done."

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Donald Trump's Climate Change Cynic Takes On The EPA Transition Posted: Nov 12 2016, 3:22am CST | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Latest Science News   Getty Images Trump has a Main Man who will Do Away with Obama’s Environmental Achievements   It looks like Donald Trump has a main man who will do away with Obama’s environmental achievements. Donald Trump and the EPA don’t exactly see eye to eye. He has openly shown his hatred of this agency. Trump even went so far as to say that this organization had fallen to levels of disgrace during President Obama’s eight years in office. Don't Miss: Hatchimals Deals on Amazon.com Trump calls what Obama worked so hard to achieve as a load of useless regulations. He wants to roll back the whole environmental plan and make America great again. Oil, coal and gas will once again have their heyday thanks to Trump. The main man who will carry out Trump’s power agenda is Myron Ebell. This individual has been a long-term opponent of what he terms is the over-doing of the environmental spiel. Global warming is just another word to him for big government and so both ought to be done away with. Ebell wants to open up lands for logging purposes and wants to dig deeper for oil and gas. Also coal will be mined in an intensive manner if he and Trump have their way. Ebell also wants the United States to reject the Paris Agreement on climate change, according to NYTimes. This man has for many years been active in the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI). This is a conservative group that receives funding from ExxonMobil. Another agency which has funded CEI is Donors Trust. This agency is supported by Koch Industries. Ebell by the way is not a scientist. This means that much of what he operates on is mere hearsay. He is against any talk regarding environmental protection. Also he wants the USA to go full steam ahead into hyper-industrialization instead of energy rationing. Thus he cuts a fine figure for a president like Trump. Trump has called global warming a hoax, according to WashingtonPost. Ebell refused to be interviewed recently and is keeping the whole matter regarding his role among Trump’s cronies hushed up. Yet he will surely play a crucial role since he fits the bill. The top priorities of both Trump and Ebell match each other down to the last details. Trump wants energy independence for the United States. The new POTUS will even carry the mission of greater fossil fuel usage to offshore areas. While Trump has said that he will see to it that the beauty of some of our natural wilderness regions are conserved, how he plans on carrying this out with Ebell on board is a mystery wrapped in an enigma.

The NES Classic Edition is a mini-fied version of the original Nintendo Entertainment System, only it does not use cartridges and comes with 30 classic NES games pre-installed. The NES surrounded many of our childhood years and the item is already showing much popularity. The item went on sale today at Best Buy, Game Stop, and Target stores in the US (with more retailers like Walmart coming soon), as well as Amazon online. The item is already sold out at the retailers mentioned above. Many have seen people waiting at the store before it opened to ensure they get their hands on it. Likewise, there is no stock left on Amazon and the device is completely sold out online. The Amazon page for the NES Classic went live at around 5PM EST this afternoon, in mere minutes the item became sold out on Amazon and the items page crashed under the immense demand of thousands of fans trying to get their hands on one. Thats a huge deal since Amazons resources are pretty capable of handling immense amounts of traffic. As of 6:45PM EST on Nov 11, the page still isn't back up Nintendo of America has tweeted about the items overwhelming demand and has ensured fans that there will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year. The Nintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition system is a hot item, and we are working hard to keep up with consumer demand. 1/3 Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) November 11, 2016 There will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year. 2/3 Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) November 11, 2016 Please contact your local retailers to check availability. A selection of participating retailers can be found @ https://t.co/rMbd6Wacpi 3/3 Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) November 11, 2016 There are already listings on eBay with ridiculous asking prices in the thousands of dollars. Auctions are reaching upwards of $600 for an item that otherwise costs $60. The demand is real with the NES Classic and Nintendo will be making a lot of money this Holiday season. Lets hope theres enough of the Nintendo Switch to go around once it comes out. Via Share Facebook Twitter © 2000-2016 GSMArena.com All brands | Privacy | Terms | Contact us Desktop version

Riggio complained along with other retailers that the volatile campaign was a massive distraction that kept Americans from shopping. Barnes & Noble, the world's biggest bookstore chain, said it saw the biggest impact on weeknights, when the three major cable TV networks provided a steady diet of talking heads weighing the strengths and weaknesses of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. "We expect a bounce-back," Riggio said in an interview after Trump's unexpected victory. "The preoccupation with the election was hurting sales." VIDEOS TOP JOBS Retail executives are notorious for coming up with excuses for weak sales, from the weather to a fluctuating holiday calendar, and analysts were skeptical of their claims. But in the months leading up to Election Day, Riggio was joined by a chorus of fellow CEOs that included Gap Inc.'s Art Peck, Signet Jewelers Ltd.'s Mark Light, Yum! Brands Inc.'s Greg Creed and Todd Penegor from Wendy's Co. On Thursday, Kohl's Corp. CEO Kevin Mansell joined the fray, saying on an earnings call that the election had been a distraction and that the "certainty" of the outcome would be good for the all-important holiday season. Niccolo Ricci, CEO of Stefano Ricci, a closely held Italian luxury-menswear company, said wealthy people often turn cautious during an election year. That proved to be true in New York, where sales fell during the past few months, according to the company. Ricci said he expects consumer sentiment to improve in the next few weeks. In an effort to get U.S. consumers to turn their attention to Christmas spending, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp. and Best Buy Co. on Thursday announced their store hours for the Black Friday shopping weekend two weeks away. They will open on Thanksgiving day again, as will department stores like Macy's Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. Companies are eager to get their marketing plans back on track. Target held off on running its holiday ads on network TV during the campaign. Instead, the retailer moved them to lifestyle channels like HGTV and the Food Network, where they were less likely to appear alongside negative campaign commercials. With the election over, Target, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Best Buy Co. on Thursday announced their store hours for the Black Friday shopping weekend. They will open on Thanksgiving day again, as will department stores like Macy's Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. As the election fades, the question of what a Trump presidency might mean for retailers, brands and restaurants remains. The president-elect campaigned on limiting international trade, including by slapping tariffs on goods from China and Mexico. That could increase costs for retailers because they mostly sell foreign-made products, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. "We have to wait and see how these policies unfold," Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren said in an interview. "There's a lot of things that are said in the election process, and then you actually get into office." On the campaign trail, Trump also talked about cutting regulations and corporate taxes, platforms now more likely to pass after Republicans maintained control of both chambers of Congress. "These could be very positive for business and our consumer, and ultimately very positive for Macy's," Lundgren said. Riggio, who founded Barnes & Noble, declined to say for whom he voted, but the 75-year-old entrepreneur said he's seen a lot of presidents come and go and that none has had a profound long-term effect on the bookseller's financial performance. He does, however, expect sales to pick up as the election moves further into the background. "You won't turn a switch and see the whole retail business coming back, but it hit a bottom and it's starting to turn up," Riggio said. "People are going to get on with their lives."   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Police: Multiple stabbings at Mountain View High School, suspect in custody LDS Church 'retires' Mormon apostle's 'little factory' pamphlet Critics cringe at Trump strategist Bannon's ties to alt-right, rhetoric targeting Mormons Make a low calorie whipped cream from an unlikely source for your Thanksgiving pumpkin pie How Trump can make money off the Secret Service ELEVATE Life is a Peach at the SALT Awards   Salt Lake Regional Medical Center First in the U.S. to Perform Meniscus Replacement   From Wall St to Hawaii to Utah Valley: UVU Professor Cary Wasden Mentors MBA Finance Students   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

IPhone sales are soaring in China, Russia and India. Editorial: China’s high tech will be a challenge to U.S. World-Herald editorial Nov 12, 2016 BLOOMBERG NEWS Apple’s store in Wangfujing, China, is the largest in Asia. IPhone sales are soaring in China, Russia and India. Beijing-based journalist Michael Schuman put his finger this week on a key point regarding China’s global economic position. Schuman wrote: “Instead of acting as the workshop of the world, churning out cheap stuff for Walmart Stores Inc., China intends to create its own national champions to compete with, and even supplant, America’s. Chinese leaders want U.S. consumers to buy Chinese smartphones using Chinese operating systems, instead of Chinese consumers buying those made by Apple Inc.” That’s where the next stage of global competition will take place. Maintaining our competitiveness will depend above all on private industry’s ongoing embrace of innovation and creativity.

Shaun King, social justice writer While the US is no stranger to hate crimes, Trump’s win has made the brash, brasher. We have reproduced disturbing accounts of some victims, being chronicled by Shaun King, senior justice writer for newspaper NY Daily News, on Twitter. Some of the accounts have been edited for clarity and space. We’ve retained the racial slurs, despite being nauseated by them, to expose the intolerance. I’m a nurse at a cardiology office and I put a portable heart monitor on an Iranian Muslim woman, who has been a citizen since 1986. They have wires that connect to a black box the size of a cellphone. She asked me if I had a letter or something she could have so that people wouldn’t think it was a bomb and kill her. She said she is more terrified to live here now than when she was a refugee in Iran. A group of students gathered in the hallway to make a “wall” and did not allow students they felt were of Hispanic descent into their classes and lockers. I am at Walmart. A woman came up to me and pulled my hijab off and said, “This is not allowed anymore. So go hang yourself with it.” Noticed a group of 5th graders chanting. “Build a wall!” Clearly, they were parroting hatred they heard at home. Muslim students of NYU Tandon School of Engineering found ‘Trump’ scrawled on the door of their prayer room I was on the back of the bus and this group of girls gets on. They look around and look at me and said, “Aren’t you people supposed to be sitting in the back of the bus?” I looked around and saw that there were mainly black and Hispanic people sitting in the middle of the bus. I ask this girl to repeat herself and she says, “Aren’t you supposed to be sitting in the back of the bus now? Like Trump is president!” As I’m stopped at a gas station this morning, a group of guys yell over: “Time to get out of this country, Apu!” “Hey Nigger. Pick that up. Keep my streets clean.” At first I wasn’t sure what I heard. Then he repeated it, while his friends egged him on, beckoning me to pick up the ketchup-stained Burger King cup rolling near my feet. I was at a liquor store to get cigs. And a group of white guys ask me if I can speak English. When I chuckled and ignored them, they followed me and said chinks should get out of the country while we still can because a more “pure America is finally going to come back”. When the clerk asked them to leave, they started laughing and called him bin Laden, and said they’d come back to burn him on a cross. Today, I was harassed by an older white man who presumed I was Mexican. “I can’t wait till Trump asks us to rape your people and send you back over to the biggest damn wall we’re going to build. Go back to hell, wet back!” After saying all of that, he threw the water in his cup in my face, gave me the middle finger, and ran off. I’ve never been terrified of being a woman and a minority until today. While pumping gas, I had a vehicle pull up beside me. Out jump four males, all of whom are Caucasian. They proceed to talk about the election and how they are glad that they don’t have to deal with niggers much longer. I just kept quiet. Until one walked over to me and said, “How scared are you, you black bitch. I should just kill you right now, you’re just a waste of air!” I kept my head down. He then proceeds to say, “What, are you deaf or something, you nigger?” Then another guy steps out and shows me his firearm. He says, “Your lucky there’s witnesses. Or else, I’d shoot you right here.” A slur in a toilet in a high school in central Florida, threatening African-American students Tags: Bigotry warned Donald Trump regime Mumbai Related Stories Republicans protest at Donanld Trump's convention International News | 19-Jul-2016 Sikhs raise USD 400k to fight bigotry in the US International News | 27-Feb-2016 Muslim family celebrates Janmashtami in Kanpur People News | 07-Sep-2015 Attack bigotry, not freedom of expression Columnists News | 14-Jan-2015 The bigotry brigade Columnists News | 23-Apr-2014 PHOTO VIDEO Photos: Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani's dinner date in Bandra Birthday special: Sania Mirza's most glamourous Instagram pictures Photos: Alia Bhatt performs live with a rock band in Mumbai Inside Photos!

(KSNW) – It was a horrific crash Friday morning where the only one who survived was the driver of a semi truck. It started with the report of three people shoplifting about $1,100 worth of items from the Newton Walmart. Police spotted one of the two suspect vehicles heading for Hutchinson. Newton police say the car was stolen, and the chase reached speeds of more than a 100 mph. Twenty four miles down the road, the car swerved to miss stop sticks on the highway and crashed into the front of a semi. The two suspects, 27-year-old Wendell Lue Hicks III and his passenger 48-year-old Lee Francis Billinger, were pronounced dead at the scene. KSN sat down with Newton Police Chief Eric Murphy Friday afternoon to talk about their vehicle pursuit policy. Murphy says they have about 10 to 15 factors they take into account before deciding whether or not to pursue a vehicle. “One is the nature of the crime, another would be whether we know who the individuals are that are trying to elude us,” said Murphy. Murphy says other factors include the amount of traffic in the area, the location of the pursuit and the overall general safety of the public. KSN asked, who is responsible for making the call to engage in a pursuit? “It’s kind of a judgement call on the officer based on the information that he has as to whether, what level of crime it is,” said Murphy. Murphy says any member of their command staff has the power to call off a pursuit at any time, if they feel the danger is too high to the public. The chief adds there is no set time limit for how long they pursue a vehicle. KSN asked Murphy, with the suspects vehicle reaching speeds of up to 115 miles per hour, would there have been a point in time under their per policy, to stop the pursuit? “Had we went into a heavily populated area like the city of Hutchinson, we would have probably looked at terminating the pursuit,” said Murphy. Murphy says for simple thefts, like shoplifting, they usually don’t pursue vehicles. KSN asked him to explain, under their policy, why they did in this case? “They attempted to steal $1,100 of property from Walmart, they were also driving a vehicle they had put stolen tags on and so this just wasn’t a regular shoplifting,” said Murphy. Murphy says his staff will be reviewing the incident today to make sure the policies they have in place for vehicle pursuits were followed correctly. He says they review the policy on a one to two year basis, making sure they are utilizing the best practices. The Newton police chase policy limits the number of units they send in a pursuit. They have to make sure some officers remain in the city to deal with local emergencies. Two Newton officers were part of Friday’s pursuit, which is within policy.

He was a senior adviser, fundraiser and board member for Future 45, the super PAC backed by Joe Ricketts and Sheldon Adelson that became the largest big-money vehicle supporting Trump. Collins used to be executive director of the NRSC and currently lobbies for Google, JPMorgan, the United Launch Alliance (a Lockheed Martin and Boeing joint venture) and the Council for Investor Rights and Corporate Accountability (representing activist investors including Paul Singer, Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman). Story Continued Below On the agencies task force, Bud Albright, who’s chairing HUD, is a lobbyist with Ogilvy Government Relations representing Calpine Corporation, Delta Star, Deltic Timber and the National Association of Water Companies. ALSO ON THE TRANSITION: On the policy side, according to an organization chart I obtained: — Danielle Cutrona, counsel to Sen. Jeff Sessions on the Judiciary Committee is in charge of “Immigration Reform & Building the Wall" — Paula Stannard, a lawyer at Alston & Bird who was deputy general counsel and acting general counsel of HHS, has been tasked with health care reform. — Bert Mizusawa, a major general in the Army Reserve, is leading defense and national security, assisted by Sandra Luff, another Sessions aide. — Rolf Lundberg, who is responsible for trade reform, worked at the Chamber of Commerce until 2013 and spun off his own lobbying firm representing Choice Hotels and the International Franchise Association. — Jim Carter, tasked with tax reform, is an in-house lobbyist for manufacturing company Emerson. — VA reform goes to Bill Hatfield, a former lobbyist and director of the Selective Service System under George W. Bush. — Michael Catanzaro is responsible for energy independence. At CGCN, he lobbies for the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, Hess, Encana, Noble Energy and Devon Energy. His team includes Mike Ference of S-3, who lobbies Halliburton, Koch Industries and Marathon Oil. — Brian Johnson, Chief Financial Institutions Counsel for House Financial Services Committee, has financial services. — Rob Gordon, staff director/senior policy adviser for House Natural Resources Committee, Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, has regulatory reform. — Gerard Robinson of the American Enterprise Institute is leading education, supported by Townsend McNitt, former deputy chief of staff at the Education Department. — Martin Whitmer, a lobbyist at Whitmer & Worrall, is running transportation and infrastructure. He represents the American Association of Railroads, the National Asphalt Pavement Association and the Utilities Technology Council. — Ken Klukowski, senior counsel and director of strategic affairs for the First Liberty Institute, is in charge of “protecting constitutional rights.” The policy team is led by Ado Machida, a top domestic policy aide to former-Vice President Dick Cheney and ex-lobbyist. Andrew Bremberg, a policy adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and former HHS staffer, leads "executive legal action," and Carlos Diaz-Rosillo, a lecturer at Harvard University, is "executive autority adviser." It's not yet known whether Trump will change Obama's ban on lobbyists in the administration. But the abundance of lobbyists on the transition could preview his posture. “If you’re one of those names, wouldn’t you be expected to go work as a senior adviser to the president?" a Republican tax lobbyist told PI. "Wouldn’t that be a pretty solid expectation based on the way past transitions have worked? And a lot of people on that list are lobbyists. “There’s a recognition by Trump and his team that we don’t know everything and we need to lean on policy experts who do. If they happen to be lobbyists, whatever," the lobbyist continued. "That’s just the way things are," Besides lobbyists, there are a lot of Bushies on the transition, too. All this despite Trump's anti-establishment "Drain the Swamp" rhetoric. Andrew Restuccia, Nancy Cook and I have the full story. — Dan Primack reports that tech investor Peter Thiel will have an unspecified role in the transition. WHAT A WEEK. In a fractious, disorienting time, take a moment today to think about those who've served and sacrificed. PI will be back on Monday. Tips to iarnsdorf@politico.com.

He worked on appropriations, energy, homeland security, tax, regulatory reform, telecommunications and cybersecurity bills, including the ABLE Act and Steve Gleason Act. “He is absolutely plugged in to the dynamics of the House Republican Conference and the Leadership team,” founder Lisa Kountoupes said. The firm represents CVS Health, AdvaMed, Intel, Best Buy and Exelon. — Wal-Mart promoted Bruce Harris to vice president of government affairs, responsible for all federal government advocacy. BLACKLIST: Some Trump allies are plotting to block Republicans who didn't support him from top posts or lucrative consulting gigs, Ken Vogel and Ben Schreckinger report for POLITICO. “My phone is ringing off the hook with people who were on the outs asking how they can get into Trump world,” said one operative who worked with Trump’s campaign. “I’m telling them there is no f---ing way they’re getting inside.” AROUND THE BULLHORN: More election analysis from downtown... CGCN's Sam Geduldig: "The Republican upstarts who gave GOP leaders fits are more invested in Trump’s success than anyone in the party. As a result, they have the most to gain from helping the President-elect move his agenda — and the most to lose, if he doesn’t. This is a dramatic shift that would have been inconceivable under any other newly elected President. "Republican infighting has been a major impediment to congressional action in recent years. We believe Trump’s election could bring a temporary suspension to those disagreements." Baker Botts' Jeff Munk: “President-elect Trump moderated his tax proposals over the course of the campaign and to some extent conformed them to the House ‘Blueprint’ for tax reform. But his plans to cut the corporate tax rate, and repeal the alternative minimum tax, while repealing most business credits, may run up against the realities of Congressional politics and budget process. “President-elect Trump may find more agreement over ending deferral of tax on foreign business income and imposing a one-time tax on accumulated foreign earnings in a more populist Congress. His call to end capital gains tax treatment for carried interests could find broader support.” Cornerstone Government Affairs: "The best indication for how the Trump White House will govern may come from how he decides to work with Republican Congressional leaders, namely Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. Trump has spent a good part of the past six months openly lamenting the lukewarm support given to him by Ryan and others from the “establishment” wing of the party, and has threatened retribution for those who he believes are unsupportive of his message. Tension among Trump, Ryan, and the archconservative Freedom Caucus in the House has led to speculation of a possible leadership change for the 115th Congress, but the Speaker looks likely to retain his gavel for the time being. "If Trump and Ryan are able to work out their differences, the Speaker may be able to take advantage of the opportunity to implement his lengthy policy platform, “A Better Way.” The President-elect has indicated he is willing to defer much of the policymaking to Congress, and as a result Ryan may be given the ability to pass a number of his long-desired reforms, such as efforts to simplify the tax code and cut down on business regulations. "On the Senate side, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has come out of this election stronger than ever, as he maintains control over the upper chamber of Congress despite losing two Senate seats in Illinois and New Hampshire. McConnell did a far better job of supporting a Trump candidacy than Ryan, and as a result likely stands to have much more pull in prioritizing his policy goals with the Trump White House. Of importance to McConnell, however, will be building a relationship with new Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and the 48 Democratic Senators who still maintain the ability to block many Republican policy proposals with the threat of a filibuster." Bruce Mehlman of Mehlman Castagnetti Rosen & Thomas: "Trump got out his vote, Clinton did not. A change-minded electorate saw her as more of the same and opted for a new direction. Oh, and everything we thought we understood about campaigns was wrong." LAME DUCK: GOP leaders plan to move lame duck legislation that funds the government at current levels into early next year, part of a strategy to split up any shutdown showdowns and a debt ceiling hike, POLITICO’s Ben Weyl, Burgess Everett and John Bresnahan report. “The word of the day at least is that it would be a high preference of the leadership to keep the [continuing resolution] as clean as possible,” said Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.). Also on the agenda next year: dealing with spending caps for defense and domestic spending. LEADERSHIP: After weeks of threatening to take out Speaker Paul Ryan, the Freedom Caucus appears to be rallying behind him, POLITICO’s Rachael Bade and Heather Caygle report. “The most pressing priority for many of the House Freedom Caucus members is accomplishing significant things in the first 100 days [of a Trump administration],” said Freedom Caucus co-founder Mark Meadows. “To focus on [challenging] leadership — as long as that leadership is extremely supportive of the Trump administration — would be a misplaced effort.” INFRASTRUCTURE: Donald Trump’s $1 trillion infrastructure plan is getting flak from conservative groups like Heritage Action for America and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, POLITICO’s Kathryn A. Wolfe and Lauren Gardner report. "Conservatives do not view infrastructure spending as an economic stimulus, and congressional Republicans rightly rejected that approach in 2009,” said Dan Holler, whose group is the political arm of the Heritage Foundation. Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) and House Transportation Chairman Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) both gave the proposal some words of encouragement on Thursday. DOWNSIZING: Targeted Victory, the GOP’s go-to technology consulting firm that arose from Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign, will be splitting into two companies in January, POLITICO’s Darren Samuelsohn and Daniel Lippman report. Co-founder Michael Beach will start a new company offering original digital ad technology services. Partner Zac Moffatt will shift Targeted Victory's focus to political consulting, digital marketing, fundraising and media planning. KOCH WORLD: Charles Koch told donors and staffers his political network will play a larger role in policy as Republicans sweep Washington, Fredreka Schouten reports for USA Today. WHEELS: In a letter to Trump’s transition team, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers asked the President-elect to roll back fuel efficiency standards issued during the Obama administration, The Hill’s Devin Henry reports. “The combination of low gas prices and the existing fuel efficiency gains from the early years of the program is undercutting consumer willingness to buy the vehicles with more expensive alternative powertrains that are necessary for the sector to comply with the more stringent standards in out-years,” the group wrote. KUDOS: Diane Rinaldo, Director of U.S. Government Relations at SAP, was named winner of the 2016 Women of Influence by the Executive Women's forum. She works on cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and used to staff the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

The letter, led by the National Association of Manufacturers, stressed the “urgent need to restore faith in our vital economic and government institutions and to bolster the promise of America.” To #BeTheSolution, let’s start with infrastructure, a bipartisan priority. Let’s rebuild our roads, bridges, ports, passenger rail and transit systems. Let’s invest in pipelines, railroads, tunnels and airports as well as drinking water and wastewater systems. The “Building to Win” initiative lays it all out. From transportation infrastructure to the energy infrastructure that powers our country, we can build a stronger, more inclusive economy. America is falling behind the rest of the world, but with a serious, targeted plan we can secure our economic leadership, spur real economic growth and offer more people the dignity of work.

Done Editing Tags 53 Comments Share this article 79 79 79 In the search for bright spots in Tuesday’s horrible elections, we can look to Massachusetts, where voters resoundingly rejected the attempt to gut the state’s public schools. Though—or even because—Massachusetts has the best public schools in the nation, massive amounts of money flowed into the state from the likes of the Walmart Waltons, pushing a ballot measure that would have lifted an existing cap on the number of new charter schools allowed to open in the state in a year. That would have siphoned millions of dollars from public schools, even threatening bond ratings for Boston and three other cities. Voters were not having it. Make that: Voters were really not having it. Question 2 was defeated by a 24-point margin, 62 percent to 38 percent. And the map shows just how widespread that opposition was: Of course, charter backers and their unlimited bank accounts are not necessarily deterred by a loss—Washington state voters rejected charter schools three times before the big money finally won out. But the size of their loss in Massachusetts should give the privatizers pause. And the fight to defeat this measure should be an example for future fights elsewhere. 53 Comments Share this article 79 79 79 53 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

'The difference between genius and stupidity is genius has its limits.' - Albert Einstein Home Articles Authors Email Groups Search About Us HOME / Articles / Mike Shedlock / Make Inflation Great Again! Is Trump the 'Inflatio... Make Inflation Great Again! Is Trump the 'Inflation President'? Spotlight on Bonds, Oil, Gold, Attitudes By: Mike Shedlock | Fri, Nov 11, 2016 Share Print Email A near-universal consensus has formed that Donald Trump is the "inflation president". The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, New York Times, Financial Times, Money, and Fortune all say so. I cannot find a mainstream or even a minorstream publication that begs to differ. Bloomberg goes so far as to say "Trump is about to make inflation great again." Are interest rates headed to the moon? Inflation Role Call The Financial Times says Prepare for a Reversal of Monetary Rule Under President Trump. "Historians may come to see 2016 as an economic policy inflection point. Mr Trump is deeply protectionist, reluctant to reform benefits such as Social Security and favours an extensive infrastructure programme. If implemented in full, which seems unlikely, these bold pledges would add $10tn to the public debt in the next decade." Bloomberg reports Investors Are Betting That Trump Will Be the Inflation President. "Trump is about to make inflation great again." The New York Times says The Market Is Betting Trump Will Bring Higher Inflation and Interest Rates. "When the government pours hundreds of billions of dollars into infrastructure when there is mass unemployment, it can help put those people back to work and turn it into higher economic output without creating inflation. But when nearly all the people who want a job already have one, that spending just bids up the pay of people already working, eventually resulting in higher prices more broadly." Money reports What President Trump Means for Interest Rates -- and Janet Yellen's Job. "A massive increase in fiscal spending to rebuild roads, bridges, and airports, combined with vast deficit-spending in the form of a tax cut, may lead to more money swirling around an already relatively health economy. If you include Trump's threat to impose a new tariffs on Chinese and Mexican goods, the cost of goods that Americans buy at Wal-Mart and Costco could rise by about 3%, according Moody's Analytics" The Wall Street Journal reports Donald Trump's Win Fuels Bets on Inflation. "Investors appear enthused by rising inflation expectations, partly because Mr. Trump's election and the shifting makeup of Congress, if nothing else, mean a sharp change from a period in which central banks struggled to spur inflation." Fortune says This Is the Most Important Market Reaction to Donald Trump's Victory. "Forget stocks. The one market reaction that really counts this morning is in the bond market, and its message is: economic reflation is on the way." Bond Market Reaction Curve Watchers' Anonymous provides the following charts. For all the hyperbole, interest rates are barely above December of last year, with yield on 5-year and 10-year bonds actually lower. Crude Not Signaling Inflation If crude is signaling anything, it sure isn't inflation. Gold Gold is down about $140 from the August 1, high. Some say gold does well in inflation. That's an easily disproved notion as gold fell from $850 to $250 from 1980 to 2000 with inflation every step of the way. Gold is more of a reflection on whether or not central banks have things under control. Gold fell from over $1900 to about $1100 when ECB president Mario Draghi made his famous speech: "We will do whatever it takes to save the Euro, and believe me it will be enough." Early this year, people starting seriously doubting whether central banks do indeed have things under control. Here's a hint: they don't. But perception is reality. The spike candle three days during the election was panic that Trump would win followed by realization things would not be so bad after all. In short, gold says little other than there is temporary renewed faith the economy is OK and the Fed is in control. Questions Still Abound Is the economy OK? Is the Fed in Control? Will Donald Trump label China a currency manipulator? Enact huge tariffs? Earlier today, the Financial Times reported EU Set to Impose Punitive Anti-Dumping Tariffs on Imports. Given that was Trump's election mandate as well, it's a reasonable bet he will do the same. Such a move will force prices up. But please look beyond the price hikes. Global Trade War Possibilities Global trade wars loom. And no one wins trade wars. The already high US dollar is at nosebleed levels bound to hurt exports. Tariffs will cost jobs, not protect them. Infrastructure jobs will benefit, provided Republicans hold their noses about bigger and bigger deficits. But those shovel-ready jobs will be slower and fewer than most think. In the end, money will be wasted, as it always is. Will the Fed Hike? Let's assume for a second the Fed hikes and prices rise. Hiking rates due to an artificial and arbitrary stimulus like tariffs may not be a smart thing to do. Rather than looking at prices in a vacuum, one should also look at why prices are rising. Tariffs, like supply shocks due to weather, etc., are not a good reason to hike. Please note that my position does not imply the Fed should not hike. I actually do not know what the Fed should do. Neither does anyone else, including the Fed. We are in this mess because of inane Fed policy and we would be better off if the market set rates, not an arbitrary panel of wizards who have gotten everything wrong at every major juncture, blowing three bubbles in 16 years. Is Trump the "Inflation President"? No one can say for sure, certainly not me. But I do know that history suggests that universal agreement on economic matters is nearly always wrong. The last time The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, New York Times, Financial Times, Money, and Fortune all agreed on something was four days ago. They all thought Hillary would win. They all thought stocks would sink. Now they all tell us inflation is a sure thing! People are sucking in that news like orange slurpies on a 102 degree day. Go figure.     Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Black Friday is a thing of the past — discuss By Mike Cassidy / November 11, 2016 at 1:57 PM Forget about Black Friday. It’s toast. At least in the day-after-Thanksgiving and busting-down-the-doors sense. It’s no longer the biggest shopping day of the year and the idea of focusing on one day of in-store shopping is as decrepit as the notion of single-channel shopping itself. There is a new Black Friday (of course there is) and it’s not so much a day, but a state of mind. Consumers shop when they want, where they care to and on the devices they prefer to use. And naturally, retailers are responding. Amazon started its Black Friday sales days ago. Walmart’s online Black Friday is up and running. Target’s, too. Santas in Florida, Arizona, and no doubt elsewhere, are already sitting in malls that have kicked off the now nearly-three-months-long holiday season. And why not? A survey conducted for BloomReach by Survata shows that 42 percent of shoppers start their holiday shopping by Labor Day weekend. More than 6 in 10 say they’ll start by Black Friday at the latest. Adobe says nearly a third of consumers started their holiday shopping before November this year, an increase of 5 percent from last year. But I’m a traditionalist and even if I rarely set foot in a store on Black Friday, I like having the milestone, the marker, that says the holiday shopping season has begun. And so, I’m declaring a new symbolic kickoff. Call it Onyx Friday, a multichannel, mega-start to holiday shopping. The day? November 11. Yes, today. It’s not an arbitrary choice. I have data. In fact, BloomReach data shows that Nov. 11 last year matched Thanksgiving and came within striking distance of Black Friday in online buying. And I have what’s known as thick data — or anecdotal evidence —  to back it up. Call the data/anecdotal evidence combo the sign of a tipping point: Nov. 11 is now a day of voluminous online shopping and holiday hullabaloo in malls that says, when it comes to holiday shopping, we’re all in. First, consider the Santa invasions. A quick internet search finds that shopping centers in Sacramento, Novi, Michigan, and Concord will kick off Santa-mania today. Yes, the jolly old elf will be taking his throne 11 days after Halloween to start the yule madness. “Actually, it’s three or four days later than we normally open it,” says Kim Trupiano, marketing and partnership director of Sunvalley Shopping Center in Concord. She says that the mall’s marketers wanted to wait to kick into the holiday spirit this year until the distraction of the presidential election had passed. But Nov. 11 made sense for other reasons, too. “Friday not only happens to be a great day to kick things off, but it’s a federal holiday,” she says, referring to Veterans Day. “A lot of city offices are closed and the kids are out of school. And we wanted to stay away from the election because we know people are going to be so consumed by that.” Associating no-holds-barred shopping with Veterans Day, a solemn day on which we honor our military veterans, is no doubt disconcerting for some. But Trupiano, whose husband is a Gulf War veteran, says the shopping center incorporates recognition for veterans into the day through discounts and the like. “It’s a big family day. The kids are off. The parents may be off,” she says. “I think it’s going to be a win-win that day.” It’s also a great day for many to kick off online shopping, according to BloomReach data. Last year, we declared Veterans Day the new Black Friday based on data that showed that the day not only had a high number of online orders, but also a high number of shoppers intent on buying. In fact, data from a subset of BloomReach customers indicated that the number of online purchases on Veterans Day last year was virtually the same as those on Thanksgiving Day, another day emerging as a heavy shopping day. And online orders on Veterans Day 2015 fell only 15 percent short of the number on Black Friday. Nearly as important as the number of online orders was the way shoppers behaved on Veterans Day. Last year, my BloomReach colleagues and I designed a proxy for consumer intent. The idea was to see how focused shoppers were on actually buying on a given day, as opposed to browsing. We looked at the ratio of the number of products viewed to the number of purchases. The thinking: The fewer products a shopper looked at before buying, the more focused that shopper was on buying an item on that particular shopping excursion. The red line in the graphic above represents the average number of products consumers looked at in November 2015 before placing an order — or converting, to use the industry term. The blue line represents the number of products viewed on a given day. Dips below the red line represent high-intent-to-buy days. Those above? Low-intent-to-buy. You can see that Veterans Day, Nov. 11, is far and away the day with highest intent to buy. As I said last year: It’s still a little early to declare this new Black Friday a trend based on data. And Nov. 11 also happens to be Singles Day, a huge shopping day in China. The effect on U.S. retailers is hard to discern. All that aside, based on the data, plus anecdotal evidence, it’s hard to argue that the holiday shopping season is not creeping earlier and earlier. No doubt, says Sunvalley’s Trupiano. And for a very good reason, she adds, thinking back to the early days of stores opening up on Thanksgiving Day. “I think if we had gotten any sense that that first Thanksgiving opening was a bust, we might not have done it the next year,” she says. “The last thing you want to do is have all the lights on and have the center open, if people aren’t going to be here. It was so robust that first Thanksgiving. We were like, ‘I guess this was a good idea.’” So, happy Onyx Friday.

Donald Trump's surprise victory in a tight presidential election defied Wall Street expectations, not only regarding who would lead the country, but the market's reaction to that leader. Instead of latching onto the uncertainties, the market vaulted higher on the president-elect's promise of changing the tax code and launching a huge spending program to stimulate the economy. Interest rates rose and market talk turned to inflation and higher growth. Trump's transition will be a big focus for markets in the week ahead, and of particular interest will be any guidance on whom he plans to name for key Cabinet jobs. Some of those names could be market moving, given the emphasis during the campaign on things like trade and deregulation. There is also a busy economic calendar, with the highlights both Tuesday's retail sales report and CPI inflation data Thursday. Getty Images Traders signal offers in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index options pit at the Chicago Board Options Exchange following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Chicago. The retail sales data and also the comments from merchants, who report earnings during the week, could provide important insights into how consumers weathered the election season. Retailers reporting earnings include Home Depot on Tuesday, Target on Wednesday and Wal-Mart on Thursday. Stocks in the past week surged, with the Dow rallying 5 percent to a new high, its best gain in five years. The Dow ended Friday at 18.847, and the S&P 500 was up 3.8 percent at 2,164. The Nasdaq was up 3.7 percent, but the small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed with a more than 10 percent gain. At the same time, U.S. Treasury yields zipped higher, particularly at the long end. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 2.15 percent, the highest level since January, from a pre-election level of 1.8 percent. Literally overnight Tuesday into Wednesday, market sentiment shifted, and so did the stocks that were in favor. Financials ripped higher, up 11.3 percent for the week on the outlook for higher rates and less regulation. That was the best week for the sector since the bull market began in 2009. Industrials bounced nearly 8 percent, and the Industrial Select SPDR Fund ETF had its best week in five years. Health care jumped 6 percent on Trump's vow to eliminate parts of Obamacare and on relief that Hillary Clinton did not win. She was outspoken on drug pricing and viewed as negative for drugs and biotech. The IBB iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF jumped 14.4 percent in its best week ever. There was selling in some tech names like Facebook, Amazon.com and Netflix, as investors shifted into new market leadership. "What you've also done here is you've priced in growth based on a resumption of animal spirits that may or may not occur. The point is what we do know this is a [president] who is likely to regulate less, not more. This is also an environment where interest rates have risen sharply enough that we could probably say with pretty high conviction that the lows in interest rates that you saw in July were very significant lows, the psychology around interest rates is turning," said Julian Emanuel, equity and derivatives strategy at UBS. Emanuel is keeping his year-end target for the S&P 500 just slightly higher than Friday's close at 2,175. With the markets now pricing in higher interest rates, Fed officials take to the speaking circuit in the coming week and they are being watched to see if they endorse the idea of a December rate hike, as several have already. Fed Chair Janet Yellen testifies before Congress Thursday,Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer speaks Tuesday, New York Fed President William Dudley speaks Friday and there are more than a half dozen others appearing throughout the week. "If the Fed doesn't raise rates in December, they're never going to raise them," said Jeff Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine, in an appearance on CNBC. Gundlach also said he believes the run up in yields is about 80 percent over, but the move higher should also resume next year. Strategists say the time is right for the Fed to move, given the positive reaction in markets to the changes coming in Washington. "What's important for active managers, important in that their decisions have been governed and their difficulty in generating alpha in the last four or five years, has been very much a function of the psychological slog of ultra-accommodative monetary policy being the single most determinant of asset prices," said Emanuel. "The thought of that ending is really the thing that, for us, has caused a lot of sector rotation. There's been a ton of turn in the market. it's also changed the psychology. … The people we talk to are more engaged in trying to come up with alpha generating ideas more than in the entire period of the post financial crisis." As U.S. yields rose, emerging markets were also stung by a sharp jump in rates. Their currencies were slammed, especially the Mexican peso, which was down more than 10 percent on the week. Investors will be watching out for any comments from Trump on many topics, including trade. In an interview Friday with The Wall Street Journal, he said he would potentially impose tariffs on products of companies that relocate overseas. Oil slumped in the past week, sliding 15 percent amid supply concerns. West Texas Intermediate futures were trading just above $43 late Friday. The S&P energy sector, however was up 2 percent even with the breakdown in crude futures. "If it breaks $43, it will be a huge worry," said Art Cashin, director of floor operations at UBS. He said stocks could move higher but there will be bumps along the way, particularly if oil remains under pressure.

Members of the Salvation Army Advisory Board join the mayor in putting the first donations in one of the kettles that will raise money for the less fortunate this season. From left: Maralin Manning, John Pasciucco, Mayor Koch, Capt. Tim Ross, commanding officer, Salvation Army Quincy Corps; Amy Huber and Don Uvanitte. Quincy Sun Photo/Robert Bosworth The Salvation Army’s Quincy Corps announces its annual Red Kettle Campaign is underway. The Salvation Army Red Kettle is an important event in Quincy, and bell ringers can be seen at various locations throughout the city during the holiday season. The money raised during the Red Kettle Campaign is a critical source of funding for vital programs and services for tens of thousands of families, youth and senior citizens in Quincy and across Massachusetts each year.  This includes meals, toys and other holiday support for those in need, along with funding for food pantries, social services, and education programs throughout the year. “We see new people in need of The Salvation Army’s services each day,” said Captain Timothy Ross, Corps Officer of The Salvation Army Quincy Corps Community Center. “Each circumstance is a bit different.  Some parents have seen their hours reduced and can’t make ends meet, and others don’t have enough income to cover the rising cost of food and utilities. We are excited to get the red kettles back out there so that we can continue to help all those in need.” Donations from the Kettle Campaign fund a variety of local services, including The Salvation Army’s preschool program in Quincy. The Salvation Army expects that the number of people in need across the Commonwealth will be at or near record levels this year. Funds raised during the holiday season support needed services and transformational programs all year round. “With only six weeks to raise funds that need to last all year, it’s critical that we get off to a strong start this year,” added Captain Nicole Ross. “We are fortunate to live in such a caring and supportive community and we’re asking our friends and neighbors to help us achieve a successful Red Kettle Campaign in Quincy.” Salvation Army officials stress that any contribution will help — and donations of time are accepted as gratefully as donations of money.  You can find a Red Kettle outside of all Stop & Shop and Shaw’s/ Star Markets locations in the Quincy, Braintree, Weymouth, and Hingham area as well as Roche Brothers and Walmart in Quincy.  Other locations include the South Shore Plaza and the Walmart in Weymouth.  Online Red Kettle donations can be made at www.salvationarmyma.org/Quincy. “Reaching out to those in need by volunteering to ring bells is a wonderful way to connect with the community, to give back, to share blessings, and to be blessed in return,” said Captain Timothy Ross. To volunteer this Christmas season, contact Captain Timothy Ross at 617-472-2345 or by email at Timothy.Ross@use.salvationarmy.org. The Salvation Army is also grateful for the support of Quincy’s area businesses that have sponsored many of our kettles this year.  Sponsors include Quincy Credit Union, Colonial Federal Savings Bank, Quincy College, The Quincy Sun, Curry Hardware, NorthEast Community Bank, Dr. John Pasciuccio, DDS, Rotary Club of Quincy, Keohane Funeral Home, and the Law Offices of Morgan J. Gray, P.C., and Eastern Insurance. The Red Kettle tradition began in 1891 when Salvation Army Captain Joseph McFee wanted to help feed needy citizens in San Francisco. McFee remembered the ferry landings in Liverpool England, where people would sit with small kettles that travelers would toss spare change into to help the less fortunate. Placing his own kettle on Market Street in Oakland California, McFee was able to help individuals on Christmas. The idea traveled to Boston in 1897 and the Red Kettle Campaign has been a tradition ever since.   For more information, please visit www.salvationarmy.org/Quincy This entry was posted in This Just In by rbosworth.

By 2018, there will be 2.5 billion smartphone users worldwide, according to eMarketer Inc. They will be navigating to restaurants, Snapchatting their vacations, checking movies playing at the nearest cinema, RSVPing on Meetup or looking up product availability at area Walmart stores. According to the Pew Research Center, 90% of smartphone owners use them to get information related to their location. Now, companies are starting to tap the location-based services (LBS) on consumers' phones in order to send them relevant offers and messages. According to the Location Based Marketing Association's (LBMA) latest trends report, 75% of marketers agree and believe that location-based marketing is an important business issue for 2016. Location-based technologies use wireless transmission, such as between a smartphone and a beacon or Wi-Fi access point, to pinpoint a user's location. A mobile app that has access to a phone's location services can provide navigation as well as location-specific content, like coupons or product reviews. In fact, there are myriad uses for LBS in marketing, advertising and customer engagement. MEPLAN GmbH, a German trade services provider, created the expoNAVIGATION app to help conference attendees find their favorite exhibitors faster. A user searches a database of exhibitors and enters a list of those he wants to visit. The app uses beacons to plot the shortest route around the floor, thus optimizing the customer's time and, hopefully, boosting sales for exhibitors. The Aquarium of Western Australia (AQWA), based in Hillarys, Australia, has a mobile app that guides visitors along several themed tours (like the Shipwreck Coast or Animal Extremes tours) with interactive activities for kids. Created by Apps Ppl, a developer of cloud-based mobile apps, the AQWA app is part of a larger mobile app -- "Everythere" -- that tourists use to research activities around Perth and to get directions. Location is the only piece of data that lets you know where people are throughout the day so you can engage [with] them. Asif Khanpresident, Location Based Marketing Association But it's the ability to combine location data with other customer information collected from a mobile app or store loyalty program that has the biggest potential for personalizing how businesses engage with their customers. People often use smartphones to browse the web, make online purchases and pay at the checkout counter. That information, and more, can be accessed and used to understand the buyer's habits and shopping preferences. "[LBS] can tie your entire marketing strategy together," said Asif Khan, president of the LBMA. "We're using location to blend brick and mortar with e-commerce and digital." The data can also be aggregated and combined with other consumer information and used to analyze consumer behaviors and trends. Investment in location-based technologies will rise significantly in the near future, according to Juniper Research Ltd., based in Hampshire, England. The firm expects the LBS market to jump from $12.2 billion in 2014 to $43.3 billion by 2019, with context-aware mobile services being the main driving force. Potholes in the road to location-based technologies Nevertheless, businesses have been cautious about adopting LBS, despite their interest. Forrester Research's report "Make Smart Wireless Location Technology Decisions" found that just 3% of businesses surveyed were actually using beacons, while another 11% were piloting them. This is because location-based services are actually a collection of technologies -- some old, some new and others still in research and development. It's a rapidly developing market, one that can quickly confound an unsuspecting marketer or business owner. The most common technologies are the following: GPS: GPS systems are commonly used for maps and other outdoor navigation. They can't penetrate walls and aren't accurate enough for use in small spaces, so they're not used for indoor tracking. Wi-Fi: Already generally offered free to customers, Wi-Fi is often used for simple tracking of store traffic. One downside is it can't identify unique individuals if they're using an iPhone, and accuracy can vary. Bluetooth beacons: Used primarily for indoor navigation, beacons have an accuracy range of one to several meters, depending on the product and whether fingerprinting or triangulation techniques are also used. Available in sizes as small as a matchbook, they can be hidden behind pictures or in lights. According to Forrester's June 2016 report "Make Smart Wireless Location Decisions," some beacons can send only basic data and can't accept updates, while others are more flexible. Beacons also require maintenance. "You have to place them, manage them, change batteries in them. They're operationally intensive," explained Andre Kindness, principal analyst at Forrester, which estimated an annual maintenance cost of $240,000 for keeping beacons operational in a 1,000-square-meter store versus $60,000 for Wi-Fi. On the other hand, Wi-Fi nodes run $900 a piece, according to the same study. Two emerging technologies are visible light, emitted via smart LED lights and potentially capable of tracking with an accuracy of a few centimeters, and ultrasound waves, which send out chirps that are picked up by a phone's audio receiver. Both are promising technologies, said Bruce Krulwich, chief analyst at New York-based Grizzly Analytics Ltd., which specializes in mobile technologies like location-based services and IoT. However, both have their drawbacks, as well. For visible light, businesses have to replace their lighting with smart LED lights and controllers. Meanwhile, ultrasound may trip on other ambient sounds. With more work, however, both may achieve performance better than today's Bluetooth-based solutions, said Krulwich. Fear of big brother Consumer concerns about privacy are another challenge for location-based technologies. To work well, the apps need access to the phone's location services, and consumers can deny apps access. According to the Pew Research Center, over one-third of adults and 46% of teenagers turn off location services due to fears over privacy. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art's (LACMA) mobile app requires both Bluetooth and location services to be fully functional. To encourage participation, the museum pre-empted the usual terse system messages users get asking if they want to share location data with one that asks, "Would you like to receive location-based data?" "We created it to be less intimidating," said Tomas Garcia, digital media product developer at LACMA. He added that it's also faster than using individual service prompts. In fact, users will give up their location data for the right incentive. A Forrester brief, "Fuel Contextual Marketing with Location Data," found that most phone owners would do so in exchange for benefits like discounts, a loyalty program, rewards for visiting a store or to get navigational aid in a store. A location-based future? Location is rapidly becoming the most valuable piece of information for consumer marketing. Social media platforms and many mobile apps, like weather and news, already collect a user's location information, said Khan, and they make it available in aggregate form to advertisers. "We describe location as the cookie for the physical world. Location is the only piece of data that lets you know where people are throughout the day so you can engage [with] them," he said. Behavioral data, such as location, is fast becoming more important in marketing than standard demographics, said Maribel Lopez, head of mobile marketing research firm Lopez Research, based in San Francisco. "Behavioral demographics are much more interesting," said Lopez. "You may find that Android users do this, iOS users do that, people who are in my store 10 minutes do one thing, while those who stay much longer do another." But that also means marketers must think through their messages to target customers' preferences without making them feel stalked. "The greatest challenge will be to figure out what messages you want to send and where," said Lopez. "It's the most contextual engagement you can have, and people expect engagement, not a generic message or coupon."  Next Steps Use location data to bring customers closer -- but not too close The location-based services dilemma: Privacy vs. convenience How customer trust factors into location data This was last published in November 2016 Dig Deeper on Mobile CRM software All News Get Started Evaluate Manage Problem Solve The bright and potential dark side of mobile location-based services Mobile LBS poses challenge for companies, consumers alike Mobile location-based services teeter on ethical line Maximize growth through sales collaboration Load More View All Maximize growth through sales collaboration Blockchain as a service may be in your future -- like it or not Nordstrom mines Beacon benefits in personalized customer service New digital marketing trends for 2015 emerge with full force Load More View All News Cubs merch store homers with location-based mobile marketing Going multichannel will improve customer experience -- but not without a plan Holiday shopping season signals future of mobile engagement Putting customers on the map with geolocation mobile apps Load More View All Get started Sales intelligence software converts prospects into customers LBS technology still in trial phase for most companies LBS powers personalized intranet design Cubs merch store homers with location-based mobile marketing Load More View All Evaluate The bright and potential dark side of mobile location-based services Mobile LBS poses challenge for companies, consumers alike Mobile location-based services teeter on ethical line Mobile, social CRM table stakes for customer engagement strategy Load More View All Manage How to address the mobile customer experience Going multichannel will improve customer experience -- but not without a plan Holiday shopping season signals future of mobile engagement Mobile devices are uprooting your CRM business processes Load More View All Problem solve PRO+ Content Find more PRO+ content and other member only offers, here.

'As he was leaving, he was saying that I and our baby that I am pregnant with have to die,' she told police in the application for the court order. 'He has grabbed me by my neck in an attempt to kill me.' Scroll down for video  History of violence: Suspect Michael Cwiklinski (pictured left) died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after he allegedly opened fire on two officers and killed his pregnant wife, Dalia Sabae (right), after she had obtained an order of protection against him  Police vehicles line streets of the Canonsburg, Pennsylvania neighborhood where two Canonsburg police officers were shot when they responded to a domestic call early Thursday Law enforcement personnel gather after the shooting where offices were 'ambushed', authorities said Sabae, a pharmacy worker and an expectant mother, went to stay at an emergency shelter after her latest confrontation with her husband, but she returned home after a few days.  When her husband were served with papers related to the restraining order, investigators believe he snapped, grabbed a long rifle and drove to Sabae's home.   Cwiklinski shot two Canonsburg police officers who responded to a report that the couple were fighting early Thursday, killing one of them. Cwiklinski and Sabae were later found dead, the man of a self-inflicted wound. His wife was three months pregnant at the time of her death.  Officer Scott Bashioum, 52, a seven-year veteran officer and married father of four, died at a hospital. Officer James Saieva underwent emergency surgery Thursday and was listed in stable condition Friday.  Hundreds gathered at the borough building Thursday evening. A military memorial already festooned with American flags for Veterans Day had also become a memorial for Bashioum, as people dropped off flowers, stuffed animals, signs and other mementos. An electric message sign blinked with the words, 'Please keep Scott Bashioum and his family in your thoughts' and 'Godspeed to our injured officer.' State police said Cwiklinski ambushed the officers, essentially waiting for them to arrive and opening fire even immediately. The fact that Cwiklinski 'laid in wait and fire upon the officers as they arrived speaks for itself,' state police Capt. David Heckman said.  The surviving officer, who was reportedly shot in the stomach, was flown to a hospital in Pittsburgh. His name has not been released, but he is currently in intensive care at Allegheny General Hospital with injuries not believed to be life-threatening After shooting the officers, Cwiklinkski ran from the scene and a manhunt ensued. Following a six-hour search, officials confirmed Thursday morning that Dalia Sabae and Cwiklinski were found dead inside the home, according to KDKA. Cwiklinski, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, reportedly shot the woman, who was three months pregnant, and eventually turned the gun on himself. Attorney David Wolf said he had known the couple since November 2015, when Cwiklinski was charged with simple assault and harassment for swinging a bag of groceries, reportedly containing 'heavy cans', and hitting Sabae in the eye outside a Walmart. Following that incident, Sabae filed a protection from abuse order, describing how her husband attacked her with the grocery bag after she offered to help him carry it, reported KDKA. That case was eventually resolved with the assault charge being dropped and Cwiklinski pleading guilty to harassment. He was sentenced to anger management classes and required to have a mental health evaluation, Wolf said. The attorney added that he had encouraged Sabae to get another protection order and said Cwiklinski was there when he ran into the couple at the county courthouse. Cwiklinski and Sabae, an Egyptian citizen, had met online, Wolf said.  In June, Cwiklinski was cited for harassment in connection with another dispute with his wife, according to the Observer-Reporter.  The slain police officer has been identified as 52-year-old Scott Leslie Bashioum (left). Surviving Officer James Saieva (right) is listed in stable condition after surgery Leslie Bashioum, a father of four, was pronounced dead at Canonsburg Hospital shortly after 4am, less than an hour after the shooting, the Washington County coroner said.  James Saieva, the surviving officer who was reportedly shot in the stomach, was flown to a hospital in Pittsburgh, county Coroner Tim Warco said. He was listed in stable condition after surgery at Allegheny General Hospital. Trooper Melinda Bondarenka told reporters the officers were immediately met with gunfire when they arrived at the scene just after 3am Thursday. 'Upon their arrival, the two officers were ambushed,' Bonderanka said. 'They were shot with an unknown type of firearm.' Bashioum and the other officer were responding separately to the 911 call from neighbors when they were 'ambushed upon their arrival' and immediately shot, Bondarenka said. Cwiklinski was charged with simple assault and harassment for swinging a bag of merchandise and hitting Sabae (left and right) in the eye outside a Walmart in November. She was reportedly three months pregnant The officers had arrived almost simultaneously, though authorities said other details of the initial confrontation were not immediately clear.  A firefighter responding to the scene told KDKA that when the shooting started, one of the officers was 'bleeding badly.'  'The shooter had everyone pinned down when they were trying to get him. I don't know where he was shot,' the firefighter said.  Police were seen near at least two homes in the borough about 20 miles southwest of Pittsburgh. A SWAT team was also on the scene and a police helicopter was patrolling overhead during their search for the suspect. Earlier in the morning as authorities searched for the suspect, homes in the Woodcrest Drive area were evacuated while residents in the surrounding area were warned to stay in their homes. It is understood one officer has died following this morning's shooting on Woodcrest Drive. A pregnant woman inside the home has also died During the manhunt for the suspect, residents had been warned to stay in their homes The Canon-McMillan School District canceled classes on Thursday because of the heavy police presence Authorities said the duplex may have been 'booby-trapped' but declined to provide details. Gas cans were reportedly found inside the house and inside the suspect's car, according to WPXI. KDKA reported, citing unnamed sources, that Cwiklinski packed his vehicle with gas cans and propane tanks, and opened fire on the car, trying to blow it up, but his plan failed.  The bomb squad from neighboring Allegheny County was called to safeguard the scene before police entered and found the couple dead, police said.    Angela Kelly, of Strabane, places flowers in front of the Canonsburg Municipal Building in honor of the officers shot on Thursday   Share or comment on this article e-mail 38 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Pres.

Over the next few days, a rash of racism, sexism, abuse, and hatred spread across the country. Many of the following stories were collected by activist Shaun King; more can be found on his Twitter timeline. Here is a look at the first three days of Donald Trump's America. And be warned: The language and images below are highly upsetting. Sadly, they are all too real. Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016 "I told them to back off when one of the men pushed me towards the wall. The woman then pulled my hair throwing all different kinds of racial slurs saying things like, 'Can you even speak English?' or 'Nobody even cares for your kind, you're hardly human, just an animal.' I started to cry and the threats just continued. I pushed back, trying to run or go through them, but I was immediately pushed back. Two older men came running to me and they tried to break up the commotion. One of the men was protecting me, as the woman was still trying to pull my hair saying, 'I can't believe you'd even protect something like that. Now that Trump's president, you won't have to see that!' The man protecting me pushed her back and she stopped. One of the men threatening said, 'You can't even tell what it is, is it Asian, Mexican, it needs to get out of here.'" [Facebook] "A Muslim student at San Diego State University was robbed Wednesday by two men who made comments 'about President-elect Trump and the Muslim community,' according to a police statement." [The San Diego Union-Tribune] "My first racist encounter after our new joke of a president, as I am at Walmart today a woman came up to me and pulled my hijab off and said, 'This is not allowed anymore, so go hang yourself with it around your neck, not your head.' I am traumatized." [Facebook] "Fuck niggers. #WhitesOnly. Trump." -Scrawled on a door in Maple Grove Senior High, Minnesota. [Facebook] "Dropping Jude off at school this morning and noticed a group of fifth graders chanting 'build a wall!' Fifth graders. Clearly they were parroting hate they heard at home. I'm so sad. I'm sad for our children. Here in Ventura [California], Jude is only one of a few Hispanic children in the school." [Facebook] "Now that Trump is president, we're gonna beat you chinks up and send you back to China!" [Facebook] "Guys, a Trump supporter tried pulling off my hijab ... This is not a joke anymore, all non-whites have become targets. Stay safe." [Twitter] "My mom literally just texted me 'don't wear the hijab please' and she's the most religious person in our family..." [Twitter] "My cousin (born + raised in America) walked past a Trump rally in NYC (where she lives!!!) and was told "go back to your country you chink." [Twitter] "So one of my student's aunts had to go pick up her daughter from school today because a boy grabbed her vagina. She's 10. When asked why, he said that if a president can do it, I can too." [Facebook] "'Black lives don't matter and neither does your vote' was spray painted on two Durham walls within a quarter mile of each other and community members are upset." [CBS North Carolina] "A USPS worker was filling up gas at a Shell station in Cambridge, MA... The USPS worker, a bearded white male, yelled at another male (who looked of Hispanic descent): 'Go back to your country. This is Trump Land. You ain't getting your check no more.' The other male went into the gas station and when he came out there was another heated exchange. This is repulsive, racist behavior and I hope it will be followed up on seriously." [Twitter] "Can't wait until your 'marriage' is overturned by a real president. Gay families = burn in hell. Trump 2016. Repent. God bless." [A note stuck on a car in North Carolina] "I just got back from class and on my way to class this guy went out of his way to bump into me and sort of shoved me off the sidewalk. And he said, 'No niggers allowed on the sidewalk.' And I was just shocked, I had no words. And this other guy behind, neither of them I knew, and the other one said, 'Dude, what are you doing, that's not cool.' And the other one was like, 'Dude, what? I'm just trying to make America great again.'" [Twitter] "Spray-painted swastikas, racist graffiti, and references to Donald Trump and Nazi Germany have appeared on a South Philadelphia storefront and elsewhere. The graffiti was spotted at Broad and Wharton streets a day after a bitter presidential election and on the 78th anniversary of Kristallnacht (or the Night of Broken Glass) attacks on Jews in Germany in 1938."

Day 1 of Donald Trump.https://t.co/wjrYNMHP5i pic.twitter.com/MCuozwNh2e — Shaun King (@ShaunKing) November 10, 2016 Thursday, Nov. 9, 2016 "Other side of the wall for you." [Facebook] "This is White America now. Take your retarded self and go somewhere else. Trump is president now." [Facebook] "A man came up to our table behind my seated friend and proceeded to, without greeting or warning or words at all, put his arms around her, hug her, and kiss her cheek. We all assumed it was an old friend and she squirmed around to see who it was and it was a complete stranger! … We all started telling him in no uncertain terms that he doesn't get to do that, just touch and kiss anyone whenever he feels like it, and he responded, 'But Trump just won the presidential race.'" [Facebook] "Sitting at the DMV and just witnessed something horrible. An older white man decided he didn't want to wait in line. He loudly yelled, 'I'm so glad Trump was elected. He will put an end to this bullshit.' And then, to the Hispanic woman in front of him, he said, "And you need to get the hell out of here and go back to your country." [Facebook] "Parents at Shasta High School in Redding, California, just wrote me and said white kids brought 'deportation letters' for Latino students." [Twitter] "Tonight, while at a concert in Covington [Ohio], two guys tried to push through a female security guard who was blocking off the bottom section of the venue. When they finally stepped back and understood she wasn't going to let them through, they went on to joke and laugh about how they were going to 'Donald Trump' her. You can figure out what that means on your own. When I turned around and told them to have some respect, they chanted 'Trump' in my face." [Facebook] "A possible attack against the local LGBTQ community happened this week — less than 24 hours after Election Day. There have been reports of rainbow pride flags being burned outside homes in Rochester [New York]. ... The victims, Greg Ventura and Lois Graham, say that they are shocked and believe that this was a hate crime." [RochesterFirst.com] "At Canisius College in Buffalo, in what officials said began as a prank, a black doll was photographed hanging from a curtain rod in a dorm room on Tuesday night. 'One student created a meme with language about 'Trump fans' and sent it to friends,' a university statement said."

Inside this GroupMe were messages suggesting a lynching of African-American students and photos of Jim Crow-era lynchings. Even an event was created entitled 'Daily Lynching' with today's date." [Email to University of Pennsylvania staff] "A Trump voter accosted my best friend's husband — a U.S.-born citizen of Korean heritage whose father served — to go back to his country. WTF." [Twitter] "I was out last night with a few friends, minding our own business until this man started screaming obnoxiously a few feet away from us. He was yelling random blabber and obscenities and then he yelled the words 'nigger bitch' and I immediately understood he was talking to me. I was the only black person in my friend group, let alone the whole area where we were sitting. We all got up and proceeded to slowly leave, not causing any trouble or saying anything.

 Amazon’s cloud is funding its war on Walmart, rival says Eugene Kim Nov. 11, 2016, 2:52 PM 4,328 facebook linkedin twitter email print Amazon CEO Jeff BezosGetty Images In case you still think Amazon is still predominantly an ecommerce site, here's something that'll change that. According to Deutsche Bank, Amazon's cloud business, Amazon Web Services, has become so big that some people think it is subsidizing the company's retail operations. It wrote in a note Thursday: "One AWS rival, making the point that the cloud infrastructure business has proven to be far more profitable than everyone thought, argued that the margin story at Amazon has now flipped, such that 'AWS is now underwriting Amazon’s war on Walmart.'" In fact, AWS is now the most profitable and fastest-growing business at Amazon. AWS had $3.2 billion in revenue last quarter, only a fraction of the $29 billion Amazon's retail business generated in the same period. But it saw far higher margins, with about $1 billion in operating income, compared to Amazon retail's $360 million. On top of that, AWS is still seeing a whopping 55% year-over-year growth rate, which means it still has a lot of room to grow and will likely continue to be a crazy profit-generating machine for a while. In other words, Amazon can keep pumping AWS's profits into its retail business, a market known for notoriously thin margins and intense competition. The irony is, AWS began its life as a way for Amazon to make extra money on the huge infrastructure it had built as a way to support its retail operations. Amazon Tax This isn't the first time the investment community talked about this. Social Capital's VC investor Chamath Palihapitiya went so far as to say he would bet his entire capital on Amazon if he had to choose one company precisely because of this dynamic. "The reason I think this has nothing to do with e-commerce, although e-commerce is their way of dog fooding the real reason: AWS," he said in a Quora Q&A session earlier this year. Palihapitiya even compared AWS to a "tax"because it's so widely used by every company that it'll eventually turn into a fixed annual cost for most businesses. He said: "AWS is a tax on the compute economy. So whether you care about mobile apps, consumer apps, IoT, SaaS etc etc, more companies than not will be using AWS versus building their own infrastructure. If you believe that over time the software industry is a multi, deca-trillion industry, then ask yourself how valuable a company would be who taxes the majority of that industry." To understand just how big AWS is compared to its competitors, this chart by Synergy Research Group should give a clue. In its latest quarterly analysis, the market research firm said AWS accounted for 45% of the revenue generated by public "infrastructure as a service" (IaaS) providers, bigger than the next three players combined, which are Microsoft, Google and IBM.

These cars will focus on rivaling for the BMW 5 series, a flagship large SUV and a new sports car too.  The 3 Series rival by Alfa Romeo named Giulia got appreciative comments from all over the world, along with that the car managed to go steady sales in the start of its launch. Reid Bigland, the boss of company is now looking forward to implement new plans for the company. The Giulia based Stelvio SUV is the first step of the plan which is supposed to launch in 2017.

Within a few minutes of opening, most locations were completely sold out. Ever since the reveal of the new system this summer, anticipation has been extremely great, and Nintendo appears to have underestimated how popular it would be. Still, it’s possible to get one. Yes, many went out on Friday morning to try and pick up an NES Classic of their own, but some were sent home with empty hands. Target, Best Buy, Walmart, Kmart, GameStop, and numerous other retailers sold out in quick fashion, and many employees simply answered the phone by saying, “We sold out in less than five minutes, dude.” I love you @NintendoAmerica but WHY???! #NESterday #NESmini #nesclassic pic.twitter.com/WqrQEpyl3m — Chava Mercado (@chavachievement) November 11, 2016 According to Polygon, Nintendo should have realized the popularity and excitement of the new system when they announced it four months ago. Some believe it would have been easy and expected for the company to ship out enough of the NES Classic Edition systems so they could get them to all consumers. Meanwhile, some locations had no more than 10 units to sell. Some had just six or even five, but all hope is not lost. As reported by CNET, Amazon is going to give fans a chance to pick up an NES Classic Edition of their very own on launch day, but they will need to work fast. At 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, Amazon will open availability for the $60 mini Nintendo system that is packed with 30 old-school games such as Metroid, Super Mario Bros., and the original Legend of Zelda. Amazon is making sure that everyone gets a fair shot at it too, and that is why they didn’t accept pre-orders. [Image by Nintendo] Amazon sent out emails to anyone who said they were interested in the NES Classic Edition and gave them the instructions for landing one on launch day. There will be “very limited quantities” according to Amazon, but again, they’re making this an open and fair game. One-click ordering has been turned off by Amazon, and they are limiting sales to just one per customer for the time being. They urge everyone to have their credit card and billing address information up to date so the process can be completed in a quick fashion. The short supply has brought out those looking to profit from Nintendo’s decision to release the system in small numbers. A lot of people have purchased multiple amounts of the NES Classic Edition and are selling them on online auction sites for double and triple the price, and some have had price tags as high as $1,000. Limited Stock Brings Out the Inevitable NES Mini Scalpers https://t.co/Z1uZKjwBuk #NES #Retro #NESMini pic.twitter.com/8ONLxHz9Wi — Nintendo Life (@nintendolife) November 11, 2016 If you don’t get one from Amazon later today and don’t wish to spend hundreds of dollars for one, there are other ways to prepare yourself for the next wave of NES Classic Edition systems. Sign up for email alerts – Target, Best Buy, Toys R’ Us, and other retailers allow you to sign up for alerts that will email you when an item becomes available. Check daily – One never knows when new shipments will come in, so check online availability and call stores every day. Never trust one response – As quickly as the systems were flying off the shelves on Friday, many online systems couldn’t keep up. Target’s website and app kept showing availability at stores when there were no longer any in stock. If a store shows some in stock online, call first to be sure before driving out. With more than a month to go until Christmas, there will still be numerous chances to get an NES Classic Edition mini system from Nintendo. Stores will have them back in stock, but you’re still going to have to move quickly if you want one now. Amazon, Best Buy, Target, Walmart, and others will give you more opportunities, and your best bet right now is to sign up for alerts and be prepared when your phone buzzes.

Shop with a Cop Foundation Silicon Valley For the past eight years, the Shop with a Cop Foundation Silicon Valley hosts more than 100 under-served children for a holiday shopping spree with local Bay Area police officers. For many of the children, this special opportunity becomes the only holiday experience they will have. Some participants are selected from the Readers Are Leaders reading campaign at local elementary schools, where they “earn” their way to the shopping spree. Other children participating are living in traumatic crisis from the loss of a parent, domestic violence and other tragedies. With a uniformed police officer by their side during the shopping spree, each child receives a $125.00 Target gift card to shop for gifts for their family members and for themselves. The whole premise is to humanize the people behind the badge so that children can grow up trusting the police.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Salvation Army needs ringers Friday Nov 11, 2016 at 11:40 AM Nov 11, 2016 at 11:40 AM Roger Bluhm/@roger_dcglobe The Salvation Army of Dodge City is seeking volunteer bell ringers to help with the 2016 Red Kettle Christmas Campaign, which runs Nov. 23 to Dec. 24, except Sundays and Thanksgiving Day. Volunteers will ring bells at six locations. Volunteers can select hours and days based on their own schedules between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. Most locations have a two-hour minimum for bell-ringing. The six locations are Walmart, Dillons, Farmer’s Country Market (formerly Thrifty King), Hobby Lobby, Waters True Value and Village Square Mall. "This is a great opportunity for individuals, families, groups, churches and friends to get together and give back to our community," said Lieutenant Enrique Coreano, Corps Officer of The Salvation Army. "Bell ringing has been a long-standing tradition around the world, and our volunteer bell ringers within our community are an essential part of this holiday campaign. "The funds raised through our Red Kettle Campaign not only support The Salvation Army for the upcoming year, but also help us provide other services throughout the year, including things like disaster response, food assistance through our onsite food pantry, help for the homeless, emergency rent and utility assistance, youth programs such as overnight camps and character building programs, targeted case management, and furniture, clothing and basic necessities through our Thrift Store." The Salvation Army of Dodge City is hoping for a good start to the Red Kettle drive this year. In the previous two drives weather and a lack of bell ringers hindered the fund raising campaigns from the start. The Red Kettle Campaign is a tradition that began in San Francisco in 1891, and has spread across the United States, as well as to Korea, Japan and many European countries. In the United States, The Salvation Army now assists more than 4.5 million people during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday season. To volunteer and serve as a bell ringer, call their office directly at 620-225- 4871. The Salvation Army is also accepting donations for its Christmas Campaign. To contribute, you may mail a check to The Salvation Army, P.O. Box 14, Dodge City, KS 67801 or donate online at www.donatedodge.com. The Salvation Army is also launching an online platform called Red Kettle Reason, which allows individuals, groups and businesses to host a "virtual red kettle" online and invite friends, family and colleagues to donate.

Since going on sale at a variety of major retailers like Best Buy, Walmart, and EB Games, the reissued console has sold out. In other words, it’s 1985 all over again (there are rumours Amazon.ca will be selling the console later today). Priced at $79.99, the tiny NES Classic Edition comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES titles, including Super Mario Bros, The Legend of Zelda, Metroid and Mega Man. It also supports HDMI output, obviating the need for users to dig up a TV that supports RF and RCA input. One other nice addition is a Suspend Point system, which allows you to save a game at any point. This seems like a minor addition but is actually a major quality of life improvement over how games from that era handled saving a player’s progress. The Nintendo Entertainment System launched in Japan on July 15th, 1983 and quickly became the best-selling game console of its time, selling some 61.91 million units across the world before it was finally discontinued in 2003. Related: Nintendo reveals nostalgia-fueled Mini Famicom SourceWalmart, Best Buy Sean-Paul Damn it…..Was definitely hoping to grab one of these The Iceman Cometh Fact is if you want one of these you’re going to have to pay alot more than $79.99. I managed to score one on eBay last night for $180 which is a premium for sure but really the only option it seems. Nintendo clearly is holding back inventory on this stuff. St. Misery Couldn’t wait huh? I highly doubt they’re holding back inventory, once the Xmas season is over this will be a forgotten memory. The Iceman Cometh I’d rather pay a bit more than be seen standing outside an EB Games at 530 in the morning. That kind of thing is plain stupidity. Hanseul Choi This only promotes the scalpers. This isn’t a limited edition where everyone can just wait some time where it will be readily available. Besides, you were able to wait all these years without them right. So how much will it hurt to wait another month or so. I also grew up with these games but I will never pay extra to these scalpers as it is just insane and the system doesn’t even worth that much. The Iceman Cometh Well I paid a mere $100 more whereas some are willing to pay three times that amount which is insane I agree with you generally speaking but I see stock of these being limited no matter what and I have better things to do with my time than run around to stores hunting for one Hanseul Choi If you have disposable money to spend extra I can’t say much to that. But I rather wait and not buy from these scalpers as this just makes things worse. Also no one can’t predict whether the stocks will be limited in the future. This is not a new gaming console and perhaps a very old NES unit that people buy for nostalgia so I don’t see them being so limited in the future as the demand will come down eventually. It is also a closed system where there will be no new games so no point to rush and get the unit. John Smith Say that to the Wii.. nearly took 2 years to have them stay on shelves. Lexcyn I tried my luck at WalMart this morning at 7:30 and they were sold out… everyone then went across the parking lot to EB and there were about 40 people in line. I said screw it and left. Later went back to WalMart and spoke with someone in electronics, they said they are scheduled to get shipments fairly regularly so I am not worried about getting one (eventually). MoYeung I prefer the red and white Japanese version. The Iceman Cometh Who cares. Is it a gaming unit or a piece of furniture? MoYeung More furniture than an emulated gaming hardware from 1983. SuperDSpamalot Why can’t they just sell the emulation software and the ROMs? Setup a Nintendo Steam-like service with built in emulators for all their old systems. Rev0lver Because they want to make more money and they know their business. callak _ You mean like the eShop for the WiiU or 3DS? The Iceman Cometh Greed. Pretty simple. Mario Gaucher I have a friend that went to EB Games this morning at 5:30am to wait outside of the store… there was already at least 10 person before her. John Smith I remember how rare the Wii U was before the holidays of 2006.. shrewd marketing, flawed supply chain, inflating demand? Either way, this is not the first time Nintendo is doing this to its customers. Ernie What sucked is that BB stock didn’t go on sale till 4am my time AST. Then read that it was sold out in seconds. What a crock. Dimitri You know most BB stores had stock but held some units for their workers?. I know this as i used to work there and my buddy said they got over 15 units but around 9 of them went to workers inside that got them before customers did. Sad to see they are still doing this. The Iceman Cometh Yeah that’s bullshjt Dimitri Most locations at Best Buy are like this sadly. They give their employees first picks and some employees even hide the stuff so that way they can grab it. So let’s say the warehouse team has 30, some staff will take them off of the shelves and hide them behind products to grab after and make it look like they had them or have their family pick it up. Working at Best Buy I have seen alot. Lol. Omar Damn, and I’d probably get fired for hiding a box of cookies working at Safeway lol… Dimitri Lol. At Best Buy if you are close to the managers, you can get away with anything sadly. Troll Like how close are we talking? Dinner and date? Or the whole shebang with physical intimacy? Dimitri Everything in between and all. Sadly if you are close to a manager and in their liking side or buddy-buddy then u can get away with alot. Mark Anley Made it to Walmart at 10 minutes before opening and there were 14 people in line. Luckily, they had 18 units on hand! Hooked up, played Punch-Out, Beat Mr. Dream…never lost a step :p Anonymous Got mine at 3:00 am this morning online from Best Buy. Confirmed my order, went back to check (roughly 4 minutes) and they were sold out. I was lucky. SmartOneBC No issue, went to Walmart 7am and had 80. I bought 10. 8 went up on eBay so I can make a buck for a change lol zero which walmart ?? Jon Duke I’ll take “things that never happened for 100$”. They announced it was one per customer due to high demand. LS650 Sure. Considering that most stores were issued no more than 10, and all stores were instructed not to sell more than one per customer, I find your story very believable. MR D Had a stack of them at my local Walmart. I got one. I went back later to get another and they were all gone. hardy83 Meh. I’ll get it when they restock. Nintendo is desperate for profit this holiday season with the Wii U basically dead, 3DS slowing down and Amiibo sales slowing as well. This is easy money for them and they will try to build more as fast as possible. lukeysboat managed to snag one online from ebgames last night right after 12am. was pretty brutal though….the website basically crashed. was very lucky Ernie Saw it on amazon for 2 seconds added to my cart. POOF NOT IN STOCK ANYMORE!!!! canucks4life Such BS 🙁 ShmiggsMcBiggs Wow…Amazon actually went down for about 25-30 seconds there… meh…low demand I suppose. And I just wanted a second controller…. Wireless Gadget Went to two Walmart in the morning, both sold out. Went back to my local EB Games and was able to pick one up, took me 2 hours zipping around Markham. Yes I know, this was to satisfy my childhood wish…and Christmas is around the corner… Maybe I’ll regift… Nah. Ricky Bobby Amazon is trolling everyone hard right now Jake Jensen Managed to get one from Amazon after having the item forcefully removed along every step of the checkout process at least 100 times. Ernie ME TOO. It was a tedious process though. Ernie Just got confirmation my order went through. Just waiting for tracking info!!! Jake Jensen Nice! I actually managed to somehow select free next-day shipping too, so it will arrive tomorrow! Ernie I got 1-2 shipping as well. No tracking number yet though. Jake Jensen Oh that sucks, sorry to hear! I got a shipping email this morning so it’s on its way. Still crossing my fingers that it doesn’t get “lost in the mail” Ernie Good luck. I talked to Amazon and they told me mine is shipping. They didn’t have the stock to fill my order. Im pissed now. moviegab haha i went through the same headache and managed to get one around 6:30 Omar I did not expect it to be this popular, at all. I get the nostalgia factor, but wow. heynow00 Toys r us is always a place people forget The Iceman Cometh They have no stock either It’s a joke really J-Ro If they do SNES, I am doing whatever it takes to get one LS650 The ‘shortage’ has been deliberately engineered by Nintendo. They put out a limited number, act all surprised and claim they didn’t correctly estimate demand, and will magically release some more just before Christmas after the product has been hyped up. Nintendo (and other companies) do this quite frequently with new releases. Don’t pay the rip-off prices asked for by the eBay scalpers.

Neighbors say officers were often called to the couple’s Pennsylvania duplex, and the gunman’s wife had just filed a Protection from Abuse Order (PFA) against him last month. Officer Scott Bashioum was shot and killed while responding to a domestic dispute early November 10 KDKA Michael Cwiklinski, 47, had several prior arrests, but never did any serious jail time. Most of his arrests were for assaulting or harassing his wife. Dalia Sabae is described as hard-working, sweet, kind and tireless. She is also being called a cherished coworker and friend by her co-workers at the pharmacy where she worked. Sources confirm to the station that employees feared her husband and worried he could hurt her or other employees. PFAs filed by Sabae against her husband describe him as dangerous. According to KDKA, in one incident, his wife states, “We were at Wal-Mart and I asked him if I could help him with a bag and he said, ‘No.’ He hit me in the face with the bag. It had heavy cans in it. The hospital report indicated I had a closed head injury.” That report was filed last year. The station reports that in late-October, another emergency PFA was filed. Cwiklinski’s wife states: “The defendant [her husband] was extremely intoxicated. He took a lot of my belongings and locked himself in a room with them. The defendant got angry and destroyed a lot of my personal documents and some objects around the house. The defendant left, and when he was leaving, he was saying that I and our baby, that I am pregnant with, have to die.” Sabae did go to an emergency shelter when she filed the most recent PFA. However, she stayed a few days and returned home. Investigators say once her husband was served with the recent papers, he snapped. Officials say he grabbed a long rifle and drove to his wife’s home. He allegedly killed her and their unborn child. Then, investigators say he shot two police officers, killing one. Police say Cwiklinski then killed himself. Officer Scott Leslie Bashioum, 52, was pronounced dead at Canonsburg Hospital shortly after 4 a.m. Thursday. KDKA reports that the injured officer has been identified as James Saieva, of Houston. He suffered a gunshot wound to the stomach and underwent surgery. He was last listed in stable condition at Allegheny General Hospital and his injuries are not believed to be life-threatening. KDKA sources also say that Cwiklinski tried to turn his car into a bomb, loaded it with gas cans and propane tanks. Police say he shot up the vehicle outside the house trying to make it explode, but it did not. There is reportedly no word on where Cwiklinski got the rifle. Those with PFAs against them are not allowed to have firearms. It is unclear whether police searched his home in the past for weapons. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Follow TechnoBuffalo The NES Classic Edition is out today. This is the console selling for $59.99. It features 30 NES games and a controller (with an absurdly short cable). It plays games in 4:3, Pixel Perfect and CRT-filtered style. The NES Classic is also nigh impossible to find. I was at my local Target this morning in time for its opening. There were well over 60 people in line for the console. The store had, according to the manager, 35 units. I asked a few folks up and down the line if they intended to sell the NES Classic online. Most said yes, and one told me that he will make at least $200 per system. Target, fortunately, limited customers to a single purchase. I called multiple Targets, Wal-marts and Toys “R” Us stores in the tri-state area. It was a fun 30 minutes. The NES Classic sold out instantly in all shops. Our own Sean Aune checked shops near his home. They were sold out. Curiously, one Wal-mart in his area couldn’t locate their shipment of NES Classics. The employee and Sean surmised that, perhaps, one of the workers managed to take the systems for a spin on eBay. The NES Classic Edition is the latest victim of scalping Scalping’s been a thing in the retail industry for decades now. The Cabbage Patch Kids were scalped, Tickle Me Elmo was scalped, Furbies were scalped. This applies to consoles, too, with the Wii selling for upwards of $1,000 on second-hand marketplaces in 2006. The NES Classic Edition is no different. As of 9am ET, there were 476 listings on eBay for the NES Classic Edition. A lot of them offered multiple systems. The most expensive in the pile are listed for $1,000, the cheapest in the Buy It Now pile is going for $159.99 plus $12.65 for shipping. On Amazon, the cheapest option at the time of writing this post is $479.99. These scalpers are making some serious scratch. Is Nintendo creating artificial scarcity? Artificial scarcity? That’s when a company has the means and money to produce large quantities of a product, but elects not to in order to generate fake scarcity at retail. Put plainly, is it possible Nintendo intentionally made less NES Classic Editions than they could to make it harder for them to find? Sure, it is. Some argue that artificial scarcity increases consumer demand. That “Fear of Missing Out” kicks in, and consumers foam at the mouth at the opportunity to snap up a given good. I will admit, this has happened to me. Multiple times. Nintendo has a hot item on their hands with the NES Classic Edition. Whether planned or not, the system will be difficult to find for at least this first week. Hopefully, production will pick up in time for the holidays. I have multiple friends and family members who want to find one under the tree this Christmas. I reached out to our Nintendo contact this morning with two specific questions. Is there an expected shortage? Will Nintendo meet needs for shoppers? If they respond, I will update this story with their full statement. Update 12:00pm ET: Nintendo responded to my request for comment with a statement. Here it is, in full. The Nintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition system is a hot item, and we are working hard to keep up with consumer demand. There will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year. Please contact your local retailers to check product availability. A selection of participating retailers can be found at www.Nintendo.com/nes-classic.

How Trump won the White House Published time: 11 Nov, 2016 12:25 Get short URL © Carlo Allegri / Reuters A lot has been said since Donald Trump outran Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. Some of what's been said makes sense, some doesn't. Striving to be original, I would like to discuss what has been missing from the debate thus far. On the US electoral map, deep blue dots of big cities flow into the red sea of small-town support for a Republican candidate. The United States of America is now, officially, the most divided developed country in the world. That was building up slowly, but now it is here. The level of divisiveness should come as no surprise considering that a physiotherapist, for example, in Idaho Falls, Idaho (60+ % for Trump) earns 3-4 times less money than his/her counterpart in Brooklyn, NY, yet has the same job, same hours, same responsibility.  With that type of difference, the resentment and anger is hardly avoidable. However, it is not just about the 'haves' and 'have nots'. There are many 'haves' who simply despise keyboard-thumping, latte-sipping urbanites. Even assuming that the media is telling you correctly that America's greatness is in creating ideas and developing technologies – and then letting somebody else (Chinese, Mexicans, little green men, whatever) produce actual goods – that arrangement does not work for many. Read more Trump should resist neocon & shadow gov’t influence to justify people’s hopes – Ron Paul to RT Americans are used to being justly proud for putting the first man on the Moon – these days they would likely sell the know-how and the tech to the Chinese and let them fly the actual mission. Americans used to be proud of producing CATs and Cadillacs – but who was the last person to be proud of owning a Caddy? Your late Uncle Rupert on the year Reagan won his first elections? 'We invented Google and Facebook' for some reason does not have the same ring it once did, does it? Perhaps, because of all those tens of thousands of Indian programmers, coming to the US through H1B visas? Just a thought. The global system of values is a myth. Dos and don'ts are as different now in New York City as in Auburn, Ala. (or, for that matter, Stuttgart, Germany) as they have ever been, and at every step of the way in your regular life. NYC and LA always looked different – but they never before looked that demonstratively opposite, demonstratively smug. Houses, cars, TV shows, even shops in the big cities today look alien to the visiting one-storied America. The crowd who could (barely) afford Wal-Mart can't love the crowd going to The Whole Paycheck (sorry, you know what it's really called). Meanwhile, the Feds, with their guaranteed paychecks, long vacations and general sense of importance generate widespread dislike. Not a specific neighbor, working for, say, the DEA, of course – as a class. America has not forgotten that in the winter of 2009, when house prices were collapsing, when the jobs were disappearing the only – only - island of stability was the Beltway, the rich suburbia around Washington DC where the top and mid-level Feds are living. There are no crises in the Feds' world! That helps explain why in places like Montgomery County, MD Hillary took home 76+% of the vote! Read more ‘His worst nightmare’: Sanders threatens Trump over minorities That leads us to 'illegal immigration issues for dummies': you either feel that “the illegal” is stealing you job, and vote Trump, or you are rich enough to hire a lawnmower/fence fixer/dog walker cash in hand, no questions asked. And then you're feeling happy that you saved, while never having to worry that Jose or Maria will someday sue you - and will likely vote Hillary. Who knows how many voted for Trump feeling that they voted against political correctness, 2016 edition? Yes, for students of liberal arts colleges (60,000 dollars per annum, tuition only), Trump is evil reincarnate, the way he goes about women. But you know what? 63 percent of American women in the “white, non-college” category were not put off by that and voted for the billionaire businessman. Regarding global affairs, let's face it, most people do not care about such things – unless those affairs arrive to their doorstep. 9/11, for example, was a public insult to America. In response, America got up and kicked the offenders in the their teeth (and a few of those, who just happened to be nearby – just ask Saddam). Honor avenged and immediate threat eliminated, America stopped caring. Why should we pay for the security of all the allies and even the wanna-be allies? Why fight Russia and China at every corner near their borders? ISIS is the most horrible thing in living memory, with their inventive public executions – but where's the public outrage? Where are the crowds by the White House demanding something to be done? They are not there and that's that – America wants to deal with the problems at home, not fight for anybody or anything abroad. So Hillary as a candidate was a huge mistake; few presidential candidates have so uniquely combined so many negative qualities. Trump may be swashbuckling, loud mouth, not logical – but he's “one of the boys” - even if he was born into a millionaire's family. At least it's obvious how he made his money – those Trump hotels were brilliant ads for him. Hillary? I'm sorry, but the person who charges 'banksters' $250,000 for a speech (and who's husband charges double that amount) can't be honest, and she can't be “one of the girls.” #Clinton failed because she didn't remind Rust Belt workers that Dems bailed out the auto industry. #Bernie would've pic.twitter.com/sxrOcdSWWE— Ed Schultz (@NewswithEd) November 11, 2016 Last but not the least, the mainstream media. If they were just a tad less vitriolic, a tad less hysterical, kept some appearances of being neutral – despite all the above, Hillary would be getting ready to move it in the White House right now. Nobody in living memory would remember an official candidate from the main party being routinely called, for example, “low life," "moron," "freak," etc. And not by some upstart websites,  but the nation's top-shelf media: NYT, WaPo, CNN, etc. Apparently, the newspapers that were supporting John Adams were yelling that his opponent Thomas Jefferson would, if elected, legalize polygamy and incest. But that was in 1796. Since then, a political discourse in the United States had taken a somewhat more civilized form – until now. Unlike Hillary, who could and likely would retire, the MSM is now facing an uphill – in my opinion, unwinnable – battle to bring back all those they hurt and insulted in the last year. By being – frankly – miscalculating idiots, they gave rise to a new wave of competitors. Ok, Drudge was around for years, but how many have ever heard of Breitbart News before this year? The MSM can gnash their teeth – and they do - calling Breitbart 'fascist' or whatever - but that ship has sailed, there's a new major alternative news source in America. And let's try and guess who will be the first to interview President Trump – Steve Bannon or, say, Ezra Klein? So, the elections are over and done with, Donald Trump is the 45th president of the United States. The MSM are telling us that it was a fluke, a swan song of conservatism. I don't think so. If Trump and his team do not completely screw it up, if they do even a quarter of what they promised, then it's aggressively liberal America that will be fading away, never to return.

As Annabelle Tometich reported Thursday, it looks like Aldi is coming to Cape Coral. The German-born discount store broke ground this summer for a store in Lehigh Acres, and a location in Naples will open Nov. 17. And Whole Foods Market will enter Lee County when it opens a Fort Myers store in mid-2018; it already has a supermarket in Naples. Three months ago, Walmart opened a Neighborhood Market in Cape Coral, offering all of the groceries typically found in a regular Walmart, but not as many non-food items. With Save-a-Lot, Winn-Dixie, Fresh Market, Target and other smaller grocers in Southwest Florida, we want to know which is your favorite.

Capital City News Serving Baton Rouge and City of Central Media Kit Read Current Print Edition Contact Us Posts Home News Sports Business Features Opinion Settlement at Shoe Creek Breaks Ground November 11, 2016 0 Comments Ground-breaking ceremonies were held on Tuesday, Oct. 25 for The Settlement on Shoe Creek, a 150-acre traditional neighborhood development on Sullivan Road/Central Thruway across from the Wal-Mart Super Center. Developer Prescott Bailey said the project will blend more than 479 home sites, 250 apartments, 100 assisted living units, numerous parks, and more than 150,000 square feet of commercial space. A town square with an outdoor pavilion for concerts and other events will be centrally-located within the development. Lot sizes will range from 25’ for town homes, 35’ to 50’ for rear alley load cottages, and 60’ to 100’ for estate homes’ front load lots. Lot pricing will range from $40,000 to $87,000. Bailey said Phase One will include 114 single family homes, and a 5,000-square-foot gym. Bailey said developer Southern Lifestyle Development (“SLD”), was formed out of a desire by its principals to change the way real estate should be developed. Its primary mission is to build communities that celebrate lifestyle by introducing components that elevate the quality of life. The group’s first real estate development was the nationally-acclaimed Village of River Ranch, one of the best known and successful smart growth communities in the nation. Prescott said, “Since building on mixed use elements could not always be incorporated into every project, SLD began developing more conventional communities that nonetheless incorporate lifestyle elements such as walkability, recreational features and parks and open spaces — communities that change the way people live.” SLD was formed by Robert Daigle, Rodney Savoy and Robert Gagnard, the original developers of the Village of River Ranch. The Settlement at Shoe Creek ran into opposition from some local residents who feared such a large development would threaten the city’s rural character and endanger the school system’s ability to absorb the additional students. However, after visiting River Ranch in Lafayette and learning about the plans, Central Mayor Jr. Shelton and members of the Central City Council became convinced the project fit the city’s Master Plan and the city’s long-term interests.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     The Mud Dragon Fossil Reveals Insights About The Last-surviving Dinosaurs Posted: Nov 11 2016, 8:53am CST | by IANS, in News | Latest Science News   A well preserved fossil of a new species of winged dinosaur, known as Tongtianlong or Mud Dragon, is giving scientists vital clues on a late flurry of evolution before the mass extinction event. Credit: Junchang Lu   Scientists have discovered a dinosaur fossil -- nicknamed the 'Mud Dragon' -- that can help them better understand how the last-surviving dinosaurs were flourishing before their mass extinction. Don't Miss: Hatchimals Deals on Amazon.com 'Mud Dragon', which meant 'muddy dragon on the road to heaven', was a bird-like species, discovered from a building site near Ganzhou in China. According to the study published in journal Scientific Reports, the two-legged animal belonged to a family of feathered dinosaurs called oviraptorosaurs. They were characterised by having short, toothless heads and sharp beaks. "This new dinosaur is one of the most beautiful, but saddest, fossils. Its skeleton is one of the best examples of a dinosaur that was flourishing during those final few million years before the asteroid came down and changed the world in an instant," said Steve Brusatte of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. Fossil discoveries in recent decades suggest that this group of flightless animals were experiencing a numbers boost, diversifying into new species, during the 15 million years before the dinosaurs went extinct, the researchers noted. Further, the study showed that it was probably one of the last groups of dinosaurs to diversify before the asteroid impact 66 million years ago, which killed off all of the non-bird dinosaurs. The fossil remains was remarkably well preserved and almost intact, lying on its front with its wings and neck outstretched. According to scientists, the creature may have died in this pose after becoming mired in mud about 66-72 million years ago.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Massive Cyber Attack Hit Top 5 Russian Banks: Kaspersky Posted: Nov 11 2016, 9:20am CST | by IANS, in News | Technology News   Photo Credit: Getty Images   A massive cyber attack hit top five Russian banks this week, global internet security giant Kaspersky reported on Friday, adding that these attacks were still going on. Don't Miss: Hatchimals Deals on Amazon.com The distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack began on Tuesday and targeted "the websites of at least five well-known financial institutions in the top 10" in Russia, according to a statement released by Moscow-based Kaspersky to Taiwannews.com. DDoS attacks attempt to cripple machines or network resources by flooding them with requests from multiple IP addresses. Taiwan, the US, India and Israel accounted for more than half of the attacks. From more than 24,000 hijacked devices located in 30 countries, 666,000 requests were being sent per second using botnet. Botnet is a network of private computers that are infected with malicious software and controlled as an aggregate without the owner knowing about it. "These attacks were still ongoing as of Thursday, with most lasting around an hour, but the longest continuing for up to 12 hours," the Kaspersky statement read. A similar attack on October 21, using the botnet from 100,000 hijacked devices, hit the major DNS service provider Dyn in the US. "The attacks are conducted from botnets, consisting of tens of thousands computers, which are located in tens of countries. We registered the first attack early in the morning … the next attack in the evening involved several waves, each of them was twice as powerful as the previous one. Bank's cyber-security noticed and located the attack in time. There have been no problems in client online services," read the statement of Sberbank, one of the affected banks. In October, the US government accused Russia of waging a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations before the November 8 election.

Riggio complained along with other retailers that the volatile campaign was a massive distraction that kept Americans from shopping. Barnes & Noble, the world's biggest bookstore chain, said it saw the biggest impact on weeknights, when the three major cable TV networks provided a steady diet of talking heads weighing the strengths and weaknesses of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. "We expect a bounce-back," Riggio said in an interview after Trump's unexpected victory. "The preoccupation with the election was hurting sales." Retail executives are notorious for coming up with excuses for weak sales, from the weather to a fluctuating holiday calendar, and analysts were skeptical of their claims. But in the months leading up to Election Day, Riggio was joined by a chorus of fellow CEOs that included Gap Inc.'s Art Peck, Signet Jewelers Ltd.'s Mark Light, Yum! Brands Inc.'s Greg Creed and Todd Penegor from Wendy's Co. On Thursday, Kohl's Corp. CEO Kevin Mansell joined the fray, saying on an earnings call that the election had been a distraction and that the "certainty" of the outcome would be good for the all-important holiday season. Niccolo Ricci, CEO of Stefano Ricci, a closely held Italian luxury-menswear company, said wealthy people often turn cautious during an election year. That proved to be true in New York, where sales fell during the past few months, according to the company. Ricci said he expects consumer sentiment to improve in the next few weeks. In an effort to get U.S. consumers to turn their attention to Christmas spending, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp. and Best Buy Co. on Thursday announced their store hours for the Black Friday shopping weekend two weeks away. They will open on Thanksgiving day again, as will department stores like Macy's Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. Companies are eager to get their marketing plans back on track. Target held off on running its holiday ads on network TV during the campaign. Instead, the retailer moved them to lifestyle channels like HGTV and the Food Network, where they were less likely to appear alongside negative campaign commercials. With the election over, Target, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Best Buy Co. on Thursday announced their store hours for the Black Friday shopping weekend. They will open on Thanksgiving day again, as will department stores like Macy's Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. As the election fades, the question of what a Trump presidency might mean for retailers, brands and restaurants remains. The president-elect campaigned on limiting international trade, including by slapping tariffs on goods from China and Mexico. That could increase costs for retailers because they mostly sell foreign-made products, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. "We have to wait and see how these policies unfold," Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren said in an interview. "There's a lot of things that are said in the election process, and then you actually get into office." On the campaign trail, Trump also talked about cutting regulations and corporate taxes, platforms now more likely to pass after Republicans maintained control of both chambers of Congress. "These could be very positive for business and our consumer, and ultimately very positive for Macy's," Lundgren said. Riggio, who founded Barnes & Noble, declined to say for whom he voted, but the 75-year-old entrepreneur said he's seen a lot of presidents come and go and that none has had a profound long-term effect on the bookseller's financial performance. He does, however, expect sales to pick up as the election moves further into the background. "You won't turn a switch and see the whole retail business coming back, but it hit a bottom and it's starting to turn up," Riggio said. "People are going to get on with their lives."     Previous Article Next Article Loading comment count... Commenting is closed.

(Photo: Save Our Public Schools) Sorting through this week’s humiliating defeat by Donald Trump at the polls, Democrats are having a hard time finding any bright spots in all the darkness. But Trump’s victory was a very close one (he lost the popular vote) and may be easy to reverse in 2020 with a better campaign. So amidst the dead ashes of defeat, where are the red-hot coals that may spark new fire in the populist rebellion that represents the party’s only hope? Some of that promising tinder can be found in communities that voted on Tuesday against the private takeover of their public schools. Reacting to the vote tally coming in against Question 2, education historian Diane Ravitch writes on her personal blog, "On a sad night for the nation, it is heartening to see that the people defended their public schools … and won." First, in Massachusetts, voters rejected a referendum called Question 2 that would have forced the expansion of charter schools in the state. Charter schools, which receive taxpayer money but are privately operated, have come to represent another example of the creeping privatization blob rapidly absorbing public infrastructure – transportation, schools, sanitation, prisons, and other essential services – into business pursuits for the wealthy. As the New York Times reports, voters, “easily turned aside a $26 million effort to increase the number of charter schools” in the state and delivered a victory for public education, a cornerstone of American democracy. Public school advocate Jennifer Berkshire – a colleague of mine at The Progressive and a Boston resident – points out at her that blog Question 2 was generally an effort by “rich, entitled assholes from New York” to tell Massachusetts voters what’s best for their children. Bay State folks would have none of it. Opposition to Question 2 came from far and wide, especially from the progressive community, including political icons Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders who opposed the charter expansion. As Berkshire explains, “The coalition extended well beyond the teachers unions that funded it, growing to include members of all kinds of unions, as well as social justice and civil rights groups, who fanned out across the state every weekend. By election day, the sprawling network of mostly volunteer canvassers had made contact with more than 1.5 million voters.” Opposition came from nearly every kind of community in the state – urban, suburban, and rural – except for the very wealthiest and whitest counties. Reacting to the vote tally coming in against Question 2, education historian Diane Ravitch writes on her personal blog, “On a sad night for the nation, it is heartening to see that the people defended their public schools … and won.” In Georgia, another progressive victory for public schools shone bright through the cloud of misery up-ballot. In that state, conservatives led by Republican Governor Nathan Deal had placed a referendum on the ballot, called Amendment 1, that would install a state agency to take over the lowest performing schools in the state and hand them over to private management groups that operate charter schools. Again, money from charter school proponents, such as members of the Walton family of Wal-Mart fame and dark money groups, poured into the state to pass the referendum, while teachers unions and public school advocacy groups supported a local opposition made up of labor groups, progressives, community organizers, and black clergy. Opposition to the charter takeover agency was widespread, with six out of ten voters opposing the bill, according to an Atlanta news outlet, with no votes coming from both Republicans and Democrats. What “galvanized opposition,” according to the reporter was widespread resistance to handing” local operations to for-profit charter school companies.” The fact that people generally want some say in where and how they can access their schools should surprise no one, but advocates for privatizing the system with charter schools keep missing the point. In the state of Washington, the threat to public schools appeared on the ballot in the form of a race for state Supreme Court. Charter proponents – such as Microsoft founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen and other major contributors to previous attempts to force charters on the state – spent at least $500,000 in an effort to unseat current judges who upheld lower court decisions ruling the method for funding charters in the state unconstitutional. The court had also ruled that the state legislature was not adequately funding schools and had levied a fine of $100,000 a day against the lawmaking body The judge who wrote the court’s charter school decision Justice Barbara Madsen was the primary target of charter advocates, notes Ravitch in another post on her blog. Madsen won reelection by 64 percent, according to a state news source, the largest margin of victory of the three incumbent candidates. In Montana, charter school advocates had targeted Democratic Governor Steve Bullock for defeat. Bullock had the temerity to express, according to a state-based news outlet, “I continue to firmly believe that our public education system is the great equalizer. Anyone who says public schools have failed isn’t seeing what’s happening.” His Republican opponent, who had become rich from selling off his high-tech startup, was the founder of a private school and an advocate for “school choice” that encourages parents to withdraw their children from public school at taxpayer expense. Bullock received the endorsement of the Network for Public Education, a public school advocacy group Ravitch helped found, for his “strong, support for public education and democratically governed schools.” The ascendancy of public education as an important progressive cause was prevalent in state and local elections around the country—in races for state board of education in Nebraska, in school board elections in Minneapolis, San Francisco, and Detroit. NPE’s endorsement quotes Bullock saying although he supports schools being able to apply for “public charter” status, which would provide more “flexibility to innovate and implement new strategies,” governance of schools must remain under the purview of the locally-elected school board and the state education agency. “Public resources should be used to support our outstanding public schools,” he states. Bullock won in a tight race, but it was a victory nevertheless, and a win for public education. The ascendancy of public education as an important progressive cause was prevalent in state and local elections around the country – —in races for state board of education in Nebraska, in school board elections in Minneapolis, San Francisco, and Detroit. Of course, support for public education did not win everywhere. There were bad outcomes in state legislative races in California and New York. Trump has expressed his strong dislike for public schools – calling them “government schools” and a “failed monopoly” – and proposed during his campaign a $20 billion federal block grant to allow states to give vouchers to low-income students to attend whatever school they want. With Trump’s election, school choice and charter advocates now have their strongest proponent in charge of federal policy. And among establishment Democrats, support for charter schools remains firm. In an astonishing feat of rhetoric, some of these centrist-minded Democrats who support charter schools are conflating Trump’s win with the victories for public education in Massachusetts and Georgia, saying the starkly dissimilar events were somehow equally bad for “kids.” As these out-of-touch Democrats celebrate the defeats of progressives such as Zephyr Teachout – who campaigned for good public schools and well paying jobs but lost to a charter school advocate backed by Wall Street – we need to remind them that it was establishment Democrats who handed this election to a rightwing populist, void of decency and respect for others and mobilized by hate and division. These sell-outs to the big money behind “reforms” such as “free trade,” “right to work,” and “school choice” are the ones who are complicit in this defeat. And it’s time progressive Democrats took their party back. Public school advocates in Massachusetts and Georgia just showed us how to do that.

Layaway, a program in which you put down a deposit on a costly item and make a series of installment payments toward it, is back for the holiday season. Walmart's program, which runs from Sept. 12 to Dec. 12, is in full swing. You can also put gifts on layaway at GameStop, Toys R Us, Sears and other retailers. Some airlines, including Delta and United, offer programs that will allow you to pay for your vacations under an installment plan. Layaway might make sense if you're calling dibs on an item that's in high demand, like an Xbox One S, or if you're plunking down a large amount of cash for a pricey 65-inch Ultra HD TV. These items retail for $299.99 and $1,697.99, respectively. Consider that the average indebted U.S. household owes $15,675 on their credit cards, according to NerdWallet. It just might be better to make manageable payments in cash. Take the time to read up on your retailer's specific policy. Even if you aren't paying full price upfront, you can still have plenty of money on the line. You may be subject to fees for starting and cancelling the plan. At the end of the day, you don't get your item until you've completed your payments. "We recommend looking into a program and reading the fine print and details before you sign up," said Courtney Jespersen, a retail analyst at NerdWallet. Check store policy first Here are the key areas where you're likely to see some differences between retailers. Availability: Most major retailers allow you to buy your items online, but those who offer layaway might have different terms for purchases made in-store versus the web. Sears and Kmart, for instance, offer 12-week payment plans for items you buy in person. If you're buying on the web at these two retailers, you may use the eight-week plan. Layaway is available in-store only at Burlington Coat Factory and Walmart. Eligibility: You may be disappointed if you're looking for a hot toy, as retailers can limit which items are eligible for installment payments. For instance, last month Sony unveiled its PlayStation VR, a virtual reality gaming headset. Unfortunately, it's not among the layaway-eligible items available at GameStop. Down payments: Be ready to put something down upfront. Some stores will allow you to put down as little as $10, which is generally the case with Kmart. However, through Nov. 26, the retailer is hosting its No Money Down layaway program, which allows shoppers to put nothing down for in-store purchases and one-cent down for purchases online. The store will revert to its regular program after that date. Fees: Be on the lookout for additional costs in the form of service and cancellation fees. For instance, Sears charges a service fee of up to $10. If you decide you no longer want your item, it will cost $25 to cancel the payment plan. "If you start making payments and then realize you don't want the product, you might get a refund minus the cancellation fee," said Jespersen of NerdWallet. Service fees are critical because you when account for them, you could be paying well over the purchase price by the time you're done with your installments. Planners' perspectives Financial planners warn consumers to proceed with caution. Understand that your layaway plan may be subject to state and local regulation, as well as the Truth in Lending Act under certain circumstances. Know the fine print before you apply. "You're giving your credit card a break," said Pamela Capalad, a certified financial planner in Brooklyn, New York. "Store cards' '12 months with zero percent financing' deals get people into the trap of taking a year to pay things off," she said. At the same time, you should consider whether it's really worthwhile to buy that big-ticket item in the first place. "The practical side of me wants to say, 'Don't buy stuff you can't afford,'" said Katie Brewer, founder of Your Richest Life in Garland, Texas. "I've seen instances where layaway is the lesser of two evils: It's better than accumulating debt and dealing with it over the next couple of months," she said.

Find A Full List Of What’s Open, What’s Closed, And Where To Find Great Deals On November 11 BuzzWorthy 6 0 0 November 11, 2016 Veterans Day 2016: Are Banks Open Today? Find A Full List Of What’s Open, What’s Closed, And Where To Find Great Deals On November 11 Nathan Francis Veterans Day 2016 is here, and anyone wondering if banks are open or trying to look for a full list of what’s open and what’s closed on November 11 can find all the information right here. Veterans Day can be one of the more confusing holidays for people trying to plan errands. While it is a federal holiday, which means government offices are closed, it’s also an important day for retailers leading into the holiday shopping season — and a popular day for restaurants and other stores to offer freebies for veterans. What’s left can be a sometimes confusing situation with uncertainty over what stays open and what closes down on November 11. The answers can be found below. What’s closed on Veterans Day 2016 Because Veterans Day is a federal holiday, it means that all government offices — like social security offices, DMV locations, and post offices — will be closed on November 11. This includes most local government offices and schools. Most banks will be closed on Veterans Day, though GoBankingRates noted that there are a few exceptions, including banks that have branches in grocery stores. HSBC: All branches open PNC Bank: In-store locations open SunTrust Bank: In-store locations will remain open TD Bank: All branches open U.S. Bank: Some branches open What’s open on Veterans Day 2016 Because Veterans Day is a day off from school for most kids as well as a popular shopping day, nearly all national retail stores and restaurants will be open and operating on full hours. This means that Walmart, Sears, KMart, Target, Costco, and Sam’s Club locations will be open on Veterans Day. The same is true of restaurants like Applebees, IHOP, Denny’s, and T.G.I. Friday’s. There are also a number of other destinations looking for business on Veterans Day 2016. This includes movie theaters, shopping malls, and other attractions like museums. Best Veterans Day 2016 sales The holiday has always been meant to honor those who served in the U.S. military, and its origin dates back to the end of the biggest war the world had ever seen at the time. As NJ.com noted, the holiday was established at the end of World War I. “The holiday’s origin dates back to World War I. Seven months before “The Great War” ended on June 28, 1919, a temporary cease fire was declared between Allied forces and Germany. The armistice went into effect the year before on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month. “The day was originally known as “Armistice Day” after the first World War ended. In 1926, the Congress passed a resolution making the day an annual day of observance. It became a national holiday in 1938. The name was changed to Veterans Day by President Eisenhower in 1954. The holiday is often confused with Memorial Day.” And to honor those who served in the U.S. Armed Forces, there are a few dozen restaurants and other stories offering freebies to veterans on November 11. This includes free meals from a special menu at Applebees, free pancakes from IHOP, and even free admission to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. A full list of Veterans Day 2016 freebies can be found here. Are you a #Military #Veteran?

If there’s a local stop you’re making and you’re not sure if it will be open, it’s best to call ahead and see.

(Noah Webb/Nursery Works via AP) Kim Cook, The Associated Press Originally Published: November 11, 2016 6 a.m. Share Tweet AP This undated photo provided by Oeuf LLC, shows their Sparrow crib in its toddler conversion, in walnut. The New York-based company started by Michael Ryan and Sophie Demenge, has a popular collection of convertible cribs in white, walnut and slate. Contemporary, clean lines make them a popular choice for today's parents looking for modern nursery gear that coordinates well with the rest of the home. (Oeuf LLC via AP) AP This undated photo provided by Fisher-Price shows their Jonathan Adler Crafted By Fisher-Price designed sleep rocker. In a new collaboration with Fisher-Price, Jonathan Adler has designed the chic sleep rocker with bold graphic textile and midcentury style steel and walnut legs. (Fisher-Price via AP) Once upon a time, baby’s room had a style all its own. But today’s parents want the nursery to blend with other rooms, reflecting a modern aesthetic. Furniture designers and retailers have responded with lots of interesting options. Jonathan Adler recently launched a collection of nursery furnishings for Fisher-Price. The New York-based designer’s line includes a chic sleep-and-play rocker with a high-contrast, black and white graphic textile, and walnut and steel legs with a midcentury modern vibe. A convertible crib features Adler’s signature honeycomb motif, and Ming-inspired feet capped in polished nickel. “I wanted to incorporate some of my favorite motifs and materials, to elevate the Fisher-Price design aesthetic,” Adler says. “The collection has a whisper of Italian Modernism and a twinkle of design panache.” (www.fisher-price.com) Walmart’s Baby Mod Olivia crib, offered in an on-trend white and amber combo, is also a convertible model, which can be reconfigured into a daybed and toddler bed as your child grows. (www.walmart.com) Convertibles are a trend, according to Jill Fehrenbacher, founder of the design site Inhabitat and its offspring, Inhabitots. “We’re seeing a growing interest in multifunctional furniture,” she says, “and this is especially true of new parents who are anxious about buying a storeful of baby gear. The idea that a crib could convert to a changing table or toddler bed is one with inherent appeal because it extends the value of what’s typically a large purchase.” Fehrenbacher herself is a fan of the Oeuf, created by New Yorkers Michael Ryan and Sophie Derenge. (www.ouefnyc.com ) “Awesome functionality, safety and clean modern looks,” she says. “I bought this crib for my son and we’re still using it now as a toddler bed for my 4-year-old. It’s moved through two different homes, from the Atlantic Coast to the Pacific, and has weathered it all beautifully.” Other affordable cribs can be found at Ikea, where the trim, contemporary Sniglar, Sundvik, Gulliver and Hensvik models sell for around $100. For just under $200, the Stuva includes under-crib storage drawers in several colors. (www.ikea.com) Babyletto’s Hudson crib has midcentury lines, sustainable New Zealand pinewood construction and a range of colors – several neutrals, as well as two-toned versions. The company’s new Bingo crib incorporates handy storage cubbies and comes in a right-this-minute white/ash/cool mint color scheme. (www.babyletto.com) P’kolino’s Belle crib has a lattice-patterned headboard that contrasts nicely with a deep gray, shell pink or pale blue base. The Geo version puts a gender-neutral geometric layer on backgrounds of coral, gray or navy. P’kolino’s website offers customizing, too; you can design your own headboard from an array of images, colors and fonts. (www.pkolino.com) If budget’s not an issue, consider Ubabub’s futuristic Pod crib. Curved plywood forms the front and back of the crib, while clear acrylic, laser-cut with tiny stars, makes up the side panels. Choose a kiwi, honeysuckle, tangerine or aqua translucent end panel for Spot on Square’s Alto crib. (www.yliving.com) Nurseryworks is always pushing the proverbial envelope on baby furnishings. One of their signature pieces, the solid acrylic Vetro crib, seems to float in space, letting other nursery elements provide color and pattern. Another crib –the Gradient, designed by Matthew Grayson and Eric Lin –has undulating 3-D forms that create an asymmetrical silhouette. “The goal, and challenge to ourselves, is to create something that doesn’t conform to the standard perception of what a crib is supposed to look like,” says Lin. Grayson’s Highlight crib can be turned into an adult-size desk once baby’s done with it; the mattress support becomes a shelf and the waterfall slats stow power cords. A burnished, 24-karat-gold square base holds the Lydian’s solid black walnut frame; the drama of mixed materials turns a simple crib into a modernist, sculptural piece of art. (www.nurseryworks.com) And finally, for the high-tech parent, Swiss designer Yves Behar has introduced the charmingly named SNOO. Produced in collaboration with its inventor, pediatrician Dr. Harvey Karp, the SNOO sleeper’s smart-technology mattress responds to a baby’s fussiness with soothing motion and white noise. Parents can also control things remotely. A swaddling outfit secures baby inside the bed, which features sturdy white mesh sides in a walnut frame, with white hairpin-style steel legs.

Election 2016 Our Election 2016 Guide to the Races You Should be Watching! Posted on November 8, 2016 Daniel Villarreal Associate Editor @ Unicorn Booty No Comments Let us be clear: we and so many other websites were DEAD WRONG about Donald Trump’s chances for winning the presidency. We’ll examine why in an upcoming article, but for now… even though everybody has their eye on the presidential race, we spent part of last night looking at city and state races on other important social issues as well as on the LGBTQ candidates running across the nation. Here’s what happened… 1) CALIFORNIA REJECTED MANDATORY CONDOMS IN PORN California’s Proposition 60, the ballot measure (supported by the anti-PrEP AIDS Healthcare Foundation) which would have required condoms in all California-produced porn, lost 54% to 46%. That’s good because it was a terrible law. 2) ARKANSAS, FLORIDA, MONTANA, AND NORTH DAKOKA ALL APPROVED MEDICAL CANNABIS  Who’s got the number for Dr. Feelgood? Interestingly, more states continue to expand access to cannabis even as the federal government still classifies the drug (alongside heroin) as a “Schedule I” drug with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. 3) CALIFORNIA, MASSACHUSETTS, AND NEVADA APPROVED RECREATIONAL CANNABIS Arizona, however, rejected it and in Maine, the vote is currently too close to call with 89% of precincts reporting and approval only winning by about 5,000 votes. 4) MASSACHUSETTS REJECTED EXPANSION OF CHARTER SCHOOLS Whether you have kids or not, the Massachusetts question over whether to limit charter school growth largely pitted Democrats against one another in a “public-schools-versus-privitization” fight. The law was set to lift the cap on the number of charter schools allowed in the state. Supporting charter schools: Obama, Michael Bloomberg, and the Walton family (of Walmart fame). Supporting public schools: the state teachers union, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders. The public school supporters won out. 5) ARIZONA, COLORADO, AND MAINE RAISED THEIR MINIMUM WAGE Arizona, Colorado, and Maine all raised their minimum wage to $12;  Washington raised it to $13.50; and South Dakota kept its minimum wage at $8.50 rather than cutting it by a dollar. 6) THE DEATH PENALTY GETS NEW LIFE IN CALIFORNIA, NEBRASKA, AND OKLAHOMA California and Nebraska kept their death penalties rather than converting all death penalty convictions to life in prison and California even passed a proposition to speed them up by putting time limits on the legal appeals process. Oklahoma also put the death penalty in the state constitition.  7) COLORADO REJECTS SINGLE-PAYER HEALTH CARE Colorado voters soundly rejected Amendment 69, a law that would have scrapped private health insurance and replaced it with a state-run single-payer heath care plan called ColoradoCare. Many doubted that the taxes meant to finance it would actually cover its costs.  8) WASHINGTON REJECTS ITS STATEWIDE CARBON TAX Washington rejected its ambitious initiative to curb the state’s carbon emissions. Unsurprisingly, many manufacturing businesses opposed the measure. 9) LOS ANGELES LOCAL TRANSIT EXPANSION With 64 precincts reporting Los Angeles seems ready to approve Measure M, effectively raising taxes to fund a serious expansion of local transit. Seattle also seems ready to approve an expansion of its local transit via Sound Transit Proposition Number 1. 10) LGBTQ CANDIDATES Although this year had a record number of 191 openly LGBTQ candidates running in local, city, state, and national elections, most of the candidates weren’t heavily favored to win. Thus, here’s a few that seemed to have the best chances of winning, plus the governor’s race from North Carolina. WINNERS North Carolina – Governor: Roy Cooper (he’s not gay, but he opposed Pat McCrory, the governor who signed HB2, America’s most transphobic law) Arizona – State House Seat: Daniel Hernandez (the gay man who saved Gabby Giffords) California – State Senate Seat: Toni Atkins Oregon – Governor: Kate Brown Pennsylvania – State Representative Seat: Brian Sims Washington – State Supreme Court, Justice Position #1: Mary Yu LOSERS Connecticut – U.S. House Seat: Clay Cope (he was a Republican Trump supporter) Kentucky – U.S. Senate Seat: Jim Gray (he lost to Rand Paul — 57 percent to 43 percent) Oklahoma – U.S. House Seat: Al McAffrey Minnesota – U.S. House Seat: Angie Craig (she lost 45 to 47 percent) Washington – Secretary of State: Tina Podlodowski UNCLEAR California – San Francisco Board Of Supervisors: Kimberly Alvarenga (she would be first lesbian in 16 years to serve, also the only queer supervisor in the running, even though since 1977/Harvey Milk, there has always been at least one queer supervisor) Texas – Harris County Commissioners: Jenifer Rene Pool (she was the first trans person to win a primary in Texas, taking 78% of primary vote) Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Al McAffrey Angie Craig Arizona Arkansas Calfornia california Clay Cope Colorado Daniel Hernandez Florida Jenifer Rene Pool Jim Gray Kate Brown Kimberly Alvarenga LosAngeles Mary Yu massachusetts Montana Nebraska Nevada NorthDakota Oklahoma Pat McCrory Roy Cooper SanFrancisco Tina Podlodowski Toni Atkins Washington You Might Also Like These Articles: VESPA CITY GUIDES Why Kaohsiung, Taiwan is a Must-Visit City Awesome People Five Charities to Support in Trump’s America Sexy People Paris: The City of Love, Light and Sexy #HornetGuys!

By Sophia Harris, CBC News Posted: Nov 11, 2016 5:00 AM ET Last Updated: Nov 11, 2016 7:48 AM ET Visa is offering its customers in both Thunder Bay and Manitoba a rebate if they use their credit cards to buy groceries anywhere but Walmart. (Brian Snyder/Reuters) Sophia Harris Business reporter sophia.harris@cbc.ca Sophia Harris has worked as a CBC video journalist across the country, covering everything from the start of the annual lobster fishery in Yarmouth, N.S., to potash prices in Saskatchewan. She now has found a good home at the business unit in Toronto where she produces for national TV news and writes and shoots and edits video for CBC.ca. Twitter: @sophiaharrisCBC More by this author Related Stories Want 10 bucks? Then buy your groceries somewhere other than Walmart, Visa tells Manitobans Walmart to stop taking Visa in Canadian stores Walmart extends Visa ban to all 16 Manitoba stores starting today Walmart's staredown with Visa gets real today, as cards no longer accepted at 3 Ontario stores Can Walmart win the grocery wars? Visa and Walmart are engaged in an all-out battle over credit card fees. And it appears neither side is close to backing down. "No one's blinking," says McMaster University business professor Marvin Ryder. "They just keep upping the ante." Visa is the latest to strike. It's offering its customers in Thunder Bay a $10 rebate if they use their card to spend $50 or more at a grocery store. Of course that store can't be Walmart. The big box giant stopped accepting Visa cards at its three Thunder Bay locations in July. If they enrol their Visa cards before Nov. 30, Thunder Bay customers have 15 days to get $10 off a $50 grocery purchase. (Visa) The month before Walmart announced it would roll out a Visa ban at is more than 400 Canadian stores to protest what it calls "unacceptably high" fees charged by the credit card company. Visa won't confirm that its latest offer takes direct aim at Walmart. But its promotions lately have focused on the two regions where Walmart has now axed the credit card. Last week Visa started offering its customers in Manitoba the same rebate deal on groceries purchased anywhere but Walmart. The retail giant dropped Visa from its 16 stores in the province last month. Striking 'where it actually hurts' When the credit card ban first hit Thunder Bay, Visa popped up with a similarly generous deal for locals: a $25 online gift card for customers who used their Visa to buy $75 worth of groceries.  Many Thunder Bay, Ont., residents received this Visa promotion in the mail last month. (Amy Hadley/CBC) Food distribution and policy expert Sylvain Charlebois believes it's no accident Visa has launched a food fight.  The Dalhousie University professor says Walmart is on a quest to become Canada's top grocer. The retailer is already gaining ground with its plan which would bring more habitual shoppers to its stores, he says. "Visa is aiming at Walmart where it actually hurts — its food retailing strategy," says Charlebois. "It speaks to how critical the situation is for [Visa]." A shopper peruses the aisles at Walmart. The retail giant is on a mission to become Canada's top grocer, says a food policy expert. (CBC) Walmart wants Visa to lower the fee it charges for credit card purchases. The retailer claims it currently pays more than $100 million in credit card fees annually in Canada. But Charlebois says if Visa concedes to Walmart, other retailers will also demand a lower rate. "You can imagine how many companies would line up to get the same deal." Visa offers Manitobans $10 in free groceries Walmart Canada to stop accepting Visa cards McMaster's Ryder believes that if Visa gives in to Walmart Canada, then its much bigger U.S. counterpart — American Walmart — will come looking for the same discount. "In the U.S., it's not a hundred million dollars in credit card fees, it's a billion dollars," he says. "The high stakes aren't in Canada, the high stakes are in the States," concludes Ryder. "And Visa, knowing what they're going to do, says, 'We're not backing down.'" Walmart also doesn't appear to be backing away. So Ryder's prognosis? "It's going to get bigger and bigger, deeper and deeper. You're kind of watching the cold war play out here." Next battle tactic? Visa would not reveal its next move. "We periodically conduct promotions to encourage Visa cardholders to use their cards in new and different places," said spokeswoman Carla Hindman in an email to CBC News. Walmart also won't say where it will strike next in it's rolling Visa ban. But the company is adamant it's sticking to the master plan. "There's no change in what we said we're going to do," spokesman Alex Roberton told CBC. Walmart says it plans to ban Visa at its more than 400 stores across Canada. (CBC) Some industry experts had speculated that Walmart's battle was sputtering because it has only targeted two regions so far since it announced its cross-Canada ban five months ago.   But Walmart says dropping Visa across the country takes time. "It's quite a complex undertaking. There's technology changes that need to be made, there's training of associates," said Roberton. He added that Walmart needs time to spread the word. "We want to make sure customers are prepared and don't show up at the cash with a cartload of groceries and two kids, and don't have the right form of payment." Both Walmart and Visa say they're hopeful a deal can be reached. But if Walmart does permanently drop Visa from all its stores, it won't be the first major retailer to shun the credit card. Neither Loblaw's discount grocer No Frills nor Costco warehouses in Canada accept Visa.
