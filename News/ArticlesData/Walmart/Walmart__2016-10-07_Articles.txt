READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Hayley Peterson Oct 8th 2016 10:34AM Target charges about 15% more than Walmart for groceries, according to a recent price check. Business Insider compared prices on 31 identical items at Walmart and Target stores in Richmond, Virginia, to find out which store was cheaper. The total basket at Walmart cost $95.98, compared to $110.25 at Target.

Groceries Photo credit: Getty Up Next See Gallery Discover More Like This of SEE ALL BACK TO SLIDE SHOW CAPTION + HIDE CAPTION – A price gap existed across all food categories, from fresh produce to packaged goods. Walmart was at least 20% cheaper than Target on the following items: eggs, milk, peanut butter, meat, olive oil, grapes, pasta, quinoa, tall kitchen bags, got cheese, and pineapple. Target had cheaper prices on a few items, however, including grapefruit, coconut oil, and canola oil. The retailer offered the biggest discount over Walmart on almond butter. Target's price was $5.08 cheaper than the same brand of almond butter at Walmart. For the price check, we compared the lowest prices available for each item. We also accounted for varying package sizes in our calculations. Our findings support a recent Moody's research note declaring that "The gulf is widening between Walmart and Target," and particularly when it comes to the retailers' grocery departments. "Overall, Target's grocery business is around 15% the size of Walmart's," the Moody's analysts noted. "Target's food business is disadvantaged because, among other factors, it lacks a Supercenter format with full-line grocery stores in tandem with a full-line general merchandise store." There were some stark differences between the Target and Walmart grocery departments we visited. The most obvious difference was size: Target store's fresh produce department was a tiny fraction of the size of Walmart's and the assortment was very limited in comparison. Additionally, the Target fresh produce department featured a lot of empty shelf space that we didn't see at Walmart. At Walmart, which is the biggest grocery store in the US, the produce department was fully stocked and about the same size as the produce department in a traditional full-sized supermarket like Kroger. We also counted about 30 store employees present in Walmart's grocery section during our visit. By comparison, we counted only one store employee in Target's grocery section. Target recently announced it would be ramping up staffing in the grocery department to try and grow its food sales. But based on our visit, it has a long way to go before it catches up to Walmart.

(REUTERS/Rick Wilking) Reuters Oct 6, 2016 at 11:23 am | Print View Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Thursday tempered its profit forecast for the next two fiscal years and said it would slow new store openings as it spends heavily on a long-term plan to transform itself into an e-commerce company. Shares of Wal-Mart, which backed this year’s earnings outlook, were down 2.3 percent in midday trading. The company said it expected online sales, which now account for about 3 percent of its total, to show a 20 percent to 30 percent increase in the second half of this year and rise even faster in the next few years. “This company over time will look like an e-commerce company,” Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon told investors gathered at Wal-Mart’s headquarters in Bentonville, Ark. New e-commerce chief Marc Lore said the company was relying on its logistics and supply chain network to win in online sales. Reuters reported Wal-Mart would double its number of large warehouses in 2016 and could ship to most of the United States in one day. Wal-Mart said it expected flat earnings for the year that ends on Jan. 31, 2018, down from a previous forecast of profit growth. It estimated capital expenditures at about $11 billion, similar to this year. Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said only about 20 percent of capital spending would go to store openings. Now the company plans to increase revenue from existing stores and its online business instead of new locations, which generated the bulk of growth in the past four years, he added. The company will moderate the rollout of its Neighborhood Market grocery stores, he said. Wal-Mart has accelerated investments in e-commerce and digital efforts from about $300 million in 2013 to $1.1 billion this year for a total of about $3 billion, excluding acquisitions, according to public filings and earnings reports. The company also spent more than $3 billion to buy e-commerce startup Jet.com. Wal-Mart said it expected fiscal 2019 earnings-per-share growth at the low end of its previous forecast of 5 percent to 10 percent.

How Wal-Mart plans to transform the way we buy groceries Sarah Halzack, The Washington Post 7:03 a.m. EDT October 8, 2016 April Styers, a personal shopper for the Walmart pickup program, selects fresh produce for customers' orders. Wal-Mart's aggressive expansion of pickup services has turned parking lots into a laboratory for the future of online grocery shopping. (Photo: Sarah Halzack, The Washington Post.) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE On a sweaty September morning in the Nashville suburbs, Anna Brummel pulls her white SUV into a Wal-Mart parking lot to stock up on groceries. But she never sets foot in the store. The mother of three had tapped out her order on her smartphone earlier while lying in bed. And now, she parks in a designated spot during a time slot she selected, and Wal-Mart workers load up her car with the goods they picked and packed for her. Wal-Mart is America's largest grocer, and its aggressive expansion of pickup services has turned its parking lots into a laboratory for the future of online grocery shopping — one of the trickiest puzzles in all of retail. Plenty of companies have tried to carve out a market for this. Instacart, along with tech titans Google and Amazon.com, have put their muscle behind doorstep grocery-delivery models that are similar to what Peapod has offered for decades. And yet, despite an e-commerce stampede that has upended sales of items such as books, electronics and clothes, researchers estimate that online shopping accounts for 2 percent or less of total U.S. grocery sales. With the pickup model, Wal-Mart is testing whether its best weapon in this digital fight is its most old-school - and hardest to replicate - asset: a network of more than 4,600 stores. It is counting on a different idea of convenience, one that caters to time-starved suburbanites who spend hours each day in their cars. Maybe for them swinging into a parking lot for a few minutes makes more sense than waiting around the house for a delivery. DELAWAREONLINE Ice cream, fasteners, diversity: 5 interesting gov contracts DELAWAREONLINE Study: DE Turf Sports Complex will boost Delaware economy Kroger and Giant are also touting pickup services, and even Amazon is reportedly considering opening bricks-and-mortar locations with grocery pickup capabilities. Pickup programs, not delivery, were the main driver of growth in habitual online grocery shopping in the past year, according to Tabs Analytics, a firm that studies the consumer-products industry. While Wal-Mart does not disclose sales figures for online grocery pickup, it has taken the program from five markets to more than 80 nationally in the past year. "We see a huge opportunity through pickup, particularly in grocery," Doug McMillon, Wal-Mart's chief executive, told investors last year. "The combination of digital relationship and stores is a winner." And the grocery business overall is an extremely important one for Wal-Mart, making up 56 percent of its U.S. sales last year. FindTheCompany | Graphiq Wal-Mart executives say pickup has had particular appeal with a demographic many retailers are eager to court: millennial moms like Brummel. As her 1- and 3-year-old sons babble in their car seats, Brummel explains that they are the pint-size reasons she does her weekly shopping this way. "I physically have no room in the cart," said Brummel, 33. "It was a nuisance before. I would have to get a babysitter, or wait till my husband was home and shop at night, and then things are kind of picked over." Wal-Mart will have hurdles to clear as it aims to build the free service into a bigger business: For one, shoppers have often been reticent to buy groceries online because they are worried about the quality of the fresh meat and produce. This will be a consumer-psychology challenge for any company trying to get in the game, but it may be a particularly acute one for Wal-Mart. "They've historically gotten mediocre marks from consumers for produce and meat," said Jim Hertel, senior vice president at Willard Bishop, a consultancy that studies the grocery business. And Wal-Mart has been outgunned online before. The retailer notched $13.7 billion in online sales last year, a far cry from the $99 billion posted by Amazon. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) Yet, if the pickup format keeps gaining customer affection, Wal-Mart could be especially well-suited to ride the wave. About 90 percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Wal-Mart store. At the Wal-Mart store in Franklin, as at other locations offering pickup, the company has added personal shoppers who handle only these online orders. James Gilmore, who leads e-commerce pickup for Wal-Mart in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, said stores typically have four to nine staffers on the team. Ashley Green, 31, talks to a Wal-Mart personal shopper as she retrieves her online grocery-pickup order. The company will have hurdles to clear as it aims to build the free service into a bigger business.  (Photo: Sarah Halzack, The Washington Post) Personal shoppers get in-depth training on how to evaluate produce and meat for quality and freshness. As Gilmore walks down an aisle of fruits and vegetables, he reaches for a jicama. "We teach them how to tell the firmness — this one actually feels really good," Gilmore says, noting that the root vegetable's brown skin is smooth to the touch. Workers are taught to look for signs that a particular item is past its peak freshness. Wal-Mart holds produce tastings for team members so they know what they're selecting for customers. There's a reason that the instruction focuses so heavily on getting fresh foods right: Gilmore says that, for shoppers, letting Wal-Mart pick out their fruit, vegetables and meat is "the trust fall," the moment when they count on a stranger to understand what they want. Of shoppers who have never bought groceries online, 67 percent say it's because "I like to select fresh products for myself," according to research by Morgan Stanley. This is why the personal shoppers show customers items such as produce and eggs before packing them into the car. The idea is that if someone saw an avocado that wasn't quite ripe or an egg that was cracked, a substitution could be made on the spot. And also, personal shoppers are supposed to get to know the preferences of repeat customers, so they might learn, for example, if someone likes their bananas a little on the green side. They might also slip your dog a biscuit or your child a lollipop. Personal shopper April Styers gathers the orders, making her way through the store pushing a wheeled cart outfitted with four rows of blue bins that allow her to keep each order separate. As she stops in front of the Honeycrisp apples, she spins each one in her hand and gives it a gentle squeeze before bagging it and placing it in the cart. "If I'm not going to eat it," Styers said, "then I'm not going to give it to anybody else." In Wal-Mart's version of pickup, shoppers have about 30,000 items to choose from — mostly groceries, but also general merchandise such as pet products or printer cartridges, all priced the same as in-store merchandise. To fill the orders, the personal shoppers make their way through the store's grocery aisles, guided by a handheld device that takes them on the most efficient route to collect all the items. Walmart has allocated parking spaces for online grocery-pickup customers so that they may get in and out of the lot quickly. Shoppers have about 30,000 items to choose from.  (Photo: Sarah Halzack, The Washington Post) Workers have a variety of ways of knowing when a customer has arrived: They have a backroom camera pointed at the designated parking spots. Shoppers can also phone in or, in some markets, use a mobile check-in feature on the Wal-Mart Grocery app. It's a pretty straightforward process, and it helps illuminate why Wal-Mart, in some ways, might have an advantage relative to other comers in the online grocery space. Doorstep-delivery models come with some difficult logistical hurdles: How do you transport milk to a customer's front door and have it stay fresh? How do you reimagine a system built for selling durable goods such as books into one that works for perishables? For pickup, Wal-Mart doesn't have to reinvent its supply chain - it is already getting these goods to its stores. "That is the opportunity. They're redeploying an asset they already have," said Laura Kennedy, a principal analyst at Kantar Retail. Pure-play delivery services have another challenge: The grocery world is known for its razor-thin profit margins. Add in shipping costs, and it's extraordinarily hard to make a healthy business. The pickup model, though, eschews that cost. "The consumer is essentially subsidizing their supply chain by their willingness to travel to the groceries and pick them up themselves," said Kurt Jetta, chief executive of Tabs Analytics. DELAWAREONLINE Cars, and gear, roll in for Delaware Auto Show DELAWAREONLINE Ellen Kullman, Fred Sears among Hall of Fame inductees The logistical differences might help explain why Wal-Mart can offer pickup free, while delivery options typically come at a cost: AmazonFresh is only available to those who pay a membership fee, and Google Express requires a membership fee or per-delivery fee. Because of the popularity of Amazon Prime, it is often assumed that doorstep delivery is what shoppers think of as the ultimate convenience. But, Hertel said that for families with kids, "being at home at a given time is somewhere between really, really tough and impossible." At the Franklin store, Ashley Green was among the millennial moms who have turned to the pickup program because it fits into their schedule. "I have two little ones in the back," said Green, 31, gesturing to her 4- and 1-year-old daughters. "To just pick up my groceries and go, instead of getting out of the car, it takes five minutes instead of an hour." The early results of the pickup program are tantalizing for the big-box chain: Executives say users tend to be more affluent than the typical Wal-Mart customer, and that they are often people who weren't buying groceries there before. In its San Bruno, Calif., office, Wal-Mart has a team of techies working to find ways to shave even more time off the pickup process. To keep on top of potential customer pain points, these Silicon Valley customer-experience specialists spend one or two days a month working in a Wal-Mart store. "That gives them the opportunity to see their product in action with real customers," said Michal Russ, director of customer experience for the online grocery program. Then they go back and tweak the app to try to cater to shoppers like Trudy Mishev, 41, who swings by the Franklin store almost every week for items such as orange juice, half-and-half and salt-and-vinegar chips. "Right now, I have a dryer going, a puppy waiting to be walked — I have a thousand things to do. And look at this, I'm on my way," Mishev said.

But academic research suggests that 70 percent to 90 percent of mergers don’t succeed, owing to a wide variety of factors. Buyers overvalue the synergies they’ll derive, or they underestimate the impact of the associated costs, or they rely too heavily on assumptions about where a market is heading. Of course, another reason acquisitions don’t always go as planned is that founders often leave a year or two after their company has been gobbled up. That’s changing in today’s challenging market for exits, where a growing number of well-funded companies and their investors are hoping that if an IPO isn’t in the cards, an acquisition might be. And in addition to other changing deal terms, acquiring companies are seemingly thinking long and hard about locking up talent longer than they have in the recent past. You saw it happen when the e-commerce company Jet sold to Walmart for a whopping $3.3 billion in August. According to Recode, cofounder and CEO Marc Lore agreed to stay on with Walmart for an atypically long five years as part of the acquisition agreement. In fact, according to that same August report, if Lore leaves before the summer of 2021, he’ll forfeit a sizable amount of both cash and stock that could otherwise earn him up to an estimated $1 billion. Lore may be exceptional in many ways, including his understanding of e-commerce and how to compete specifically with Amazon, which acquired his previous company. It’s easy to understand why Walmart wants him around. He probably won’t be alone, though. Steve Fletcher, a managing director at the global investment bank GCA, notes that it’s “hard to say” whether it’s universally the case that management teams are getting locked into longer contracts with acquirers in this market. “I don’t think anyone has a large enough sample size to say that,” he notes. But he adds that of the deals he is seeing, there is a move to sign on incoming talent for a longer period, sometimes “three or four years as opposed to [the previous standard of] 18 to 24 months.” Vas Natarajan — an investor at the venture firm Accel Partners who focuses on products and services that target developers, designers and media creators — makes a similar observation. “In the last four or five years, there’s been a rash of these acquir-hires, where the founders have left after 18 to 24 months,” Natarajan says. “But I know from talking with heads of product and corp dev teams [that they are now asking], ‘How can we do it in a way that’s much more retentive than in the past?’ M&A teams are starting to think more about structuring things in a way that you retain what you buy.” How big a trend this becomes is far from clear. As a baseline, SRS Acquiom, a San Francisco-based outfit that provides M&A post-closing services to companies, says that 21 percent of the 735 private M&A transactions it saw between 2012 and 2015 featured an earn-out period of four to five years. Meanwhile, 47 percent of those deals featured earn-out periods of 1 to 2 years. Founders who are more driven to start companies than reap their full reward from an acquirer will surely leave no matter the earn-out period anyway. Still, there’s reason for corporates to believe that longer agreements make sense. In 2013, PayPal, then a division of eBay, acquired the Chicago-based payments gateway Braintree in an all-cash deal worth $800 million. As part of that deal, the incentives of Braintree CEO Bill Ready were structured over a long period of time. In retrospect, that decision looks to be paying off for Ready and PayPal — which spun off into its own public company last year. As of September of last year, Ready was already running all product and engineering at PayPal. Just this week, he became the first person since it became an independent concern to be named to the role of chief operating officer. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe Latest Crunch Report Snapchat Starts Selling Spectacles | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Popular Posts Featured Stories The Down Round [Entire Series] VIDEO | 30:01 | The Down Round Zuckerberg claims 99% of Facebook posts “authentic,” denies fake news there influenced election 8 hours ago | Lora Kolodny How Facebook can escape the echo chamber 12 hours ago | Anna Escher Secret is coming back 23 hours ago | Sarah Buhr I refuse to review Snapchat Spectacles — but I’m glad to have my hands back yesterday | Matthew Panzarino Latest From TechCrunch Is Netflix Disney’s next big buy and is Reed Hastings its next CEO? 8 minutes ago | Peter Csathy Naver to launch $43M fund to seek out investments for its Snow and Webtoon services 56 minutes ago | Jon Russell How President Trump could abuse big data and the surveillance state 1 hour ago | Jon Stokes How drones will reshape the enterprise 1 hour ago | Alexander Niehenke Comment moderation powered by Up Next Toppling democracy one byte at a time Posted Oct 6, 2016 CrunchBoard Job Listings Developer Events Content Manager (Contract Role) at Google (Mountain View, CA, United States) Director of Marketing and Communications (Position #4782) at Northern Illinois University (DeKalb, IL, United States) Digital Marketing Analyst at Stony Brook University (Stony Brook, NY, United States) Advanced TV Product Manager - Media at Time Warner Cable/Spectrum (New York, NY, United States) Technical Product Manager @ PANTHEON at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2016 AOL Inc.

Wal-Mart told investors Thursday it would pull back on the number of new stores it was opening and instead invest some of that money into online operations. It's a key milestone: For the first time, the company expects e-commerce gains to contribute more toward its growth than expanding its brick-and-mortar footprint. Analysts and investors are skeptical that Wal-Mart can pull it off. Consumers are rapidly getting ingrained in the habit of turning to Amazon for everything from toilet paper to a new dress. Among U.S. online consumers, 55 percent say they go to Amazon first when searching for a product and about half of American households have a $99-a-year Amazon Prime membership. U.S. shoppers spend 30 percent of their time online at Amazon.com's website, compared with 3 percent on Walmart.com. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "I get that you have to be in e-commerce, but you are chasing the 800-pound gorilla," said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. "You aren't going to out-Amazon Amazon." Yarbrough worries that Wal-Mart's growth online will mostly be coming from its existing customers -- and as a result will cannibalize its stores, which are more profitable and where customers are more likely to make an impulse buy. At the same time, Amazon has been increasing its reach into Wal-Mart's customer base. Forty-two percent of Amazon Prime members are also Wal-Mart shoppers, compared with just 20 percent in 2013, said John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen & Co. And there are no signs Amazon is slowing down. It is set to add 12 million Prime members this year, on top of the 10 million it added in 2015, Blackledge estimates. With at least 17 times as many items for sale as Walmart.com, Amazon is increasingly expanding its reach into areas once dominated by traditional retailers. This year, Amazon is set to sell more apparel than Wal-Mart, and by 2018 it will be the second-largest seller of consumables, such as cleaning suppliers, paper towels and diapers, Blackledge said. Then there is Amazon's ever-increasing delivery speed. While Wal-Mart is in the early stages of offering a membership program where customers can get free two-day shipping -- rather than waiting the standard five to seven days -- Amazon is offering free same-day delivery in 27 major cities. In some markets, the e-commerce company delivers millions of products within an hour. "To compete, Wal-Mart would have to replicate the value proposition of Prime," Blackledge said. "If they could do that at scale, then they would have something, but Amazon has been singularly focused at this for 20 years." None of that should be news to Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon. He knows the company has a lofty goal in front of it, but since paying about $3.3 billion for e-commerce startup Jet.com, McMillon seemed to have a bit more spring in his step when talking to investors about the company's online strategy. "A lot of the foundational elements that we've been telling you for years that we needed to grow the e-commerce business are now in place," McMillon said. "It's time to invest more money. It's time to really get this going and start growing our e-commerce business in a different way." That new way will be led by tech-industry darling Marc Lore, who founded Jet.com and joined Wal-Mart following the acquisition. McMillon sees him as key to the company's future. The CEO half-jokingly recalled walking down the street with Lore and instinctively stepping out in front of an oncoming car to protect him. "If Marc can be Marc within this company, great things are going to happen," McMillon said. Wal-Mart expects online sales to grow 20 percent to 30 percent over the next three years with the addition of Jet. That would be a major acceleration: Online sales grew 7 percent in the first quarter and 12 percent in the second. But even 20 percent growth on a base of about $13 billion does little to move the needle at a company with nearly $500 billion in annual revenue. In the meantime, the investments are taking a toll on Wal-Mart's bottom line. The company said profit would be flat next year in part because of the heavy spending online. Wal-Mart shares fell 3.2 percent Thursday when the retailer's executives made their case to investors, and the stock was down an additional 1.2 percent on Friday. The question is whether Wal-Mart can change the shopping behavior of the tens of millions of Americans already entrenched in Amazon. Is Wal-Mart the retail equivalent of Microsoft's Bing, which tried and failed to convince Americans to break their habit of going to Google? Or can Wal-Mart -- with Jet.com -- be a disruptive force in the industry? "If someone is locked into Prime, the chance of you bringing their business over is slim," Yarbrough said. Wal-Mart's main selling point has been its physical stores, which let shoppers buy items online and pick them up on the premises. That includes having employees deliver groceries to customers' cars in the parking lot. Wal-Mart also can use its stores as a shipping point, helping it lower delivery costs. » Next page...

The WWE-style hardcore scuffle also featured foreign objects such as canned food and a shopping cart. A wardrobe malfunction also occurred. See partially NSFW footage which was originally posted to Facebook embedded below. Bottled water seems to be one of the first items that shoppers buy under the stressful circumstances of an impending natural disaster, leaving stores throughout Florida with empty or near-empty shelves. “The two woman yank on each others hair, scream and punch. At one point, one woman rams another woman with her shopping cart so hard, the victim’s breasts fell out of her dress.In response, she started hurling cans of food at the other woman,” the Miami Herald reported. Although the South Florida fight was supposedly over the last case of bottled water in the store, it may actually have been prompted by someone cutting in line, the Herald added. Fortunately there were no injuries, and evidently it was determined that it was unnecessary to summon cops to the scene. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8U8Ax5Tol1c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> With all the media coverage of the hurricane, plus the many warnings from government officials, this type of panic buying may be understandable in general, BizPacReview noted. “The two women, one clearly with a size and power advantage, began mixing it up over the water as shocked onlookers gathered around them…It is unclear who threw the first punch, but clearly the taller woman is getting the best of the one in the print dress. The the scrappy smaller woman refuses to be put off and repeatedly jumps back into the fray even when the bigger woman walks away two times. The video is a shocking example of the high anxiety people were feeling as Hurricane Matthew was bearing down on them.” According to Reuters, Walmart decided to temporarily close a number of its Florida retail outlets ahead of the storm. “A spokesperson said the company was using its experience of past disasters to anticipate what goods may be in greater demand after the storm passes.” Hurricane Matthew has weakened from a Category 4 to a Category 2 storm at this time as it moves up the coast of northeast Florida and heads for Georgia and South Carolina, ABC News reported. About 1 million Florida residents have lost power, and three deaths have been reported in the state so far. Hundreds have tragically died in Haiti and in the Caribbean as a result of Hurricane Matthew. Hurricane Matthew vs Miami pic.twitter.com/w8wbQ2cl4F — #LongLiveFlee (@_RedRum) October 6, 2016 In an unrelated Walmart incident, a Texas man who allegedly dragged his 5-year-old daughter by the hair while he pushed a shopping cart at a Houston-area Walmart last month is apparently under investigation by local police and child protective services. Cops apparently weren’t going to do anything until a social media post by a witness went viral. In July, a 30-person brawl that included parents and kids broke out at Walmart, according to authorities, and was captured on cell phone video. The incident occurred at a store in Gates, New York, located in the Rochester area. Apparently, the massive melee started when two teens allegedly ridiculed a dress worn by a 24-year-old woman in the store, and then things escalated into a WWE-style rumble. About a year ago, a co-ed punching-and-kicking melee erupted in Charlotte, North Carolina, when two Walmart loss prevention officers (i.e. store security) reportedly tried to stop a teen from shoplifting a $7 T-shirt, and others jumped in. Walmart is usually one of the venues where brawls between and among bargain hunters unfortunately erupt on the day after Thanksgiving.

Can it avoid the fate of Wal-Mart Express? Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Oct 7, 2016 at 7:08PM Image Source: Motley Fool.  With a resurgent Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon.com growing faster than ever, Target (NYSE:TGT) is getting squeezed in the middle. Comparable sales turned negative in its most recent quarter, falling 1.1%, reflecting a trend throughout retail as department store chains struggle across the board.  E-commerce sales growth is also losing steam. Though digital sales grew 16% in the second quarter, that was down from 23% in the previous quarter, and, more importantly, the company lowered its forecast for the rest of the year. It now sees comps from flat to down 2% in the third and fourth quarters, which includes the key holiday season.   Thinking small The discount retailer is turning to a familiar strategy to stem sliding sales. It's looking to open smaller-footprint locations in densely packed cities and college towns. Other retailers, including Nordstrom, Whole Foods, Macy's, and Wal-Mart, have looked to smaller stores to expand their footprint and beef up sales. Target is opening up a slate of smaller stores in big cities and college towns in order to cater to the millennials that make up one of its core constituencies. This week it opened a 45,000 square-foot store in New York's Tribeca neighborhood, about a third of the size of the average Target. Near the University of Minnesota campus, a store 15% the size of a regular Target stocks items intended for college students like mini ironing boards and twin sheets. CEO Brian Cornell told The Wall Street Journal, "We could see hundreds of these. It could be a huge part of future growth outlook over time."  In many ways, the small-footprint strategy fits well with Cornell's emphasis on signature categories, including health and wellness, baby and kids, stylish apparel and home goods. Those are all categories that millennials care about, and as young people have flocked to cities it makes sense for Target to follow them. Currently, those customers are driving Amazon's growth, as no major brick-and-mortar chain has made a play for them.  Avoiding Wal-Mart's fate At the beginning of the year, Wal-Mart announced it would shut down all 102 of its Walmart Express stores, a small-footprint concept scattered across the rural south, just a few years after launching the miniaturized chain. The Express stores faced several challenges. Wal-Mart struggled to get the product mix right, as operating small stores entails more than simply shrinking the Supercenters. It also opened many of them near existing Wal-Marts, obviating much of the need for a smaller version.   But Target's more upscale brand should give it an advantage, as should its focus on cities and college towns, places where shoppers may not have cars and therefore need convenient options close to home. Many of those cities are also devoid of Wal-Mart, as the retail giant has found it difficult to penetrate many of the nation's largest cities and is still without a store in New York. Instead of imitating Wal-Mart, Target may be better off following the lead of drugstores chain like Walgreen's and CVS, its new pharmacy partner, as that category has seen steady growth, with sales at health and personal care stores up 7.7% this year according to the Census Bureau. Sales at those stores have not only benefited from their selling more prescriptions, but they have also stocked more groceries, and consumers have turned to them for convenient "fill-in" trips. Target has to do more than just be a drugstore to make the small-store experiment work, but with its "cheap chic" brand it should be able to find the right mix between its signature categories and everyday staples like groceries and household items. While small stores could provide a valuable new revenue stream, it won't flip Target's sales slide overnight, as the company's most pressing problem is reinvigorating performance at 1,800 big-box stores. Grocery sales have been a problem, as the company has seen more spoilage than its competitors, and accelerating e-commerce growth would also be a promising sign. Still, with comparable sales headed negative for the rest of the year, the retailer could use some good news in the form of successful small stores to tout to investors.

Can it avoid the fate of Wal-Mart Express? Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Oct 7, 2016 at 7:08PM Image Source: Motley Fool.  With a resurgent Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon.com growing faster than ever, Target (NYSE:TGT) is getting squeezed in the middle. Comparable sales turned negative in its most recent quarter, falling 1.1%, reflecting a trend throughout retail as department store chains struggle across the board.  E-commerce sales growth is also losing steam. Though digital sales grew 16% in the second quarter, that was down from 23% in the previous quarter, and, more importantly, the company lowered its forecast for the rest of the year. It now sees comps from flat to down 2% in the third and fourth quarters, which includes the key holiday season.   Thinking small The discount retailer is turning to a familiar strategy to stem sliding sales. It's looking to open smaller-footprint locations in densely packed cities and college towns. Other retailers, including Nordstrom, Whole Foods, Macy's, and Wal-Mart, have looked to smaller stores to expand their footprint and beef up sales. Target is opening up a slate of smaller stores in big cities and college towns in order to cater to the millennials that make up one of its core constituencies. This week it opened a 45,000 square-foot store in New York's Tribeca neighborhood, about a third of the size of the average Target. Near the University of Minnesota campus, a store 15% the size of a regular Target stocks items intended for college students like mini ironing boards and twin sheets. CEO Brian Cornell told The Wall Street Journal, "We could see hundreds of these. It could be a huge part of future growth outlook over time."  In many ways, the small-footprint strategy fits well with Cornell's emphasis on signature categories, including health and wellness, baby and kids, stylish apparel and home goods. Those are all categories that millennials care about, and as young people have flocked to cities it makes sense for Target to follow them.

According to the Weather Channel, "potentially serious" flooding may impact areas in Georgia, South Carolina, and southern parts of North Carolina through Saturday night. Flooding had already occurred along the Florida coast, including spots near Jacksonville Beach and Daytona Beach. Hurricane Matthew has caused major disruptions in retail stores across Florida, with Reuters reporting Friday that many Walmart locations had closed due to the storm: "A spokesperson said the company was using its experience of past disasters to anticipate what goods may be in greater demand after the storm passes."

If you watched the first five games of this new-era-49er season you might be tempted to do the same. One notable quirk about the Queen of Hearts is that her commands were routinely ignored. No one was ever executed. So it will be for the folks on this blog who keep demanding the termination of this or that person in the 49ers hierarchy. The truth is that no one gets fired in York-land unless there is a sufficient breach in operational tranquility at 4949 Centennial (as there was with Jim Harbaugh) or in the abject event that the team wins less than a handful of games over a couple of years under a new, seemingly competent head coach. Barring such an eventuality, our only realistic hope for continuity in this franchise is from working within the status quo. It is therefore important to understand what the status quo actually is. Continuity and good coaching are essential ingredients to success in team sports. Letting players adjust to a good and flexible scheme, play faster and make fewer mistakes through repetition lifts the aggregate performance just as much as the infusion of talent. But the rate of influx and departure of talent is also an important variable largely independent of the first two, influenced as it is by the culture from the top of the organization. For example, the culture may determine what resources are allocated to scouting and re-signing homegrown talent, or for acquiring expensive free agents. Thus, it is important to understand the tension between a head coach’s vision and the owner’s fiscal policies, as these are at the core of the crucible within which continuity must be forged if the franchise is ever to experience success. I think we are now in the early stages of a phase in the franchise’s history that could just as easily turn out well as go down in flames. In the midst of such fragility it is sometimes easy to lose sight of context and keep shouting ‘off with their heads’. I will try and describe the context I see. Fans who impersonate the Queen of Hearts when faced with employees like Baalke, Marathe and even Jed often miss the fact that these men are simply extensions of a philosophy that originates at the very top: Daddy York. That philosophy is, fundamentally, a Walmart philosophy completely devoid of football vision but thoroughly imbued with a desire to maximize shareholder value. Indeed the only big ‘win’ the Yorks have experienced in the nearly two decades since they acquired operational control of the team is the building of a stadium that made the 49ers franchise one of the five most valuable in the sport. That’s something they care about. To understand the pedantic mind of a John York, go back to his public comments in 2000 when he dismantled the continuity of a proud franchise in order to ‘save money’. Nothing illustrates this better than the way he squandered cost-effective Pro-Bowl linemen like Derrick Deese (LT) and Kevin Gogan (RG) who, at the time, cost us 1.1 and 2.3 million annually, good deals even back then. If that period and the years of mediocrity that followed do not convince you, go back to the seventies. John, the young pathologist, spent an epic seven years as a postdoc trying to land a real job in academia, but without success. In science, seven-year post-doctoral stints are exceedingly rare and can mean only one thing — though, to his credit, John York eventually turned a smart trick and married into money. Which is why Daddy York and his pedantic mind can now direct our team’s fate from his dinner table as chief shareholder. Understand the man and you will instantly understand why Paraag Marathe is so loved by the Yorks for being ‘shrewd’ with player contracts, and why Baalke stocks up on late picks, scanning the boroughs for talent bargains each cycle — busted ACLs presenting no particular obstacle. It’s like shopping at Walmart. It would not be hard to imagine Daddy York vetoing the deal Baalke put together in Denver after Harbaugh’s dismissal — one that might have retained some continuity with Fangio while upgrading the offensive vision with Gase. Instead Daddy may have preferred the cheaper Tomsula option. Penny pinchers without vision make uninspired choices like this all the time. I know people who fit that mold. Their backyards are filled with rusted things that no longer work; though, at the time they were bought, those items were such a deal. Vision, on the other hand, is a rare thing to find in a head coach. After Walsh, we had to wait decades for Kelly. There is nothing more frustrating for a coach with vision and creativity than working for bosses without it. I know exactly how it feels. Kelly’s leverage is compromised by recent history, so he has to keep mum and suffer. For now. Having said all this, if there is a time to Walmart the team it is certainly this season, and I think Kelly must understand that too. In order to build continuity, there must first be something worth continuing. You can’t buy more than a handful of players in an offseason, anyway. The rest must come from those you draft over several years. Baalke did indeed draft a bunch of young guys, but their evaluation by Tomsula’s staff is not definitive — in part because Kelly’s system requires different skill sets (for example, zone blocking). Until the current staff knows who the ‘keepers’ are, it is hard to decide where to spend one’s offseason capital. The 49ers certainly have the cap so it is mostly a matter of knowing what to buy, even if one shops at Walmart. The key part of offensive continuity, which (in my view) is much harder to build than defensive continuity, is a franchise quarterback. The 49ers do not have such a player on their roster. Baalke has invested just one top-100 pick (Kaepernick) on a QB since the Ice Age. However, since it takes a couple of years for linemen and journeymen skill players to get their timing down in a new offense, it may make sense to draft a QB only after some semblance of stability has been built around that position (see: running game, pass pro). In the meantime, Alex Smith 2.0 would be fine as placeholder, and I think Kelly is trying to make Gabbert into that; though, so far, not successfully. So how should we see this dynamic tension between Kelly’s vision and Walmart in our quest to build continuity on the 49ers? What’s in the crystal ball? Here’s my guess, and it is only a guess: 1. More Gabbert (with a possible detour to Kaep). Gabbert helps prepare the team in practice with good and accurate execution, I understand, even if he does seem to beg a psychiatrist during games. (Blaine should talk to John Smoltz — what an inflexion point his sports psychiatrist was in 1991, both for Smoltz and the Braves!) With Garnett in there perhaps the run game will finally get traction, though Tiller is probably more solid in pass pro. Perhaps they can alternate and find out about both phases of the offensive game in alternating series. The play design that Kelly brings is clearly superior to what we’ve seen here in a while. Unfortunately, the execution is still very far behind, like teaching a teenager to gearshift on a Porsche. Until it catches up, Kelly cannot learn what plays of his current repertoire the NFL might have difficulty defending. BTW, If Kilgore goes down, one should note, the offensive experiment is probably lost entirely. Baalke failed to sign a free agent backup center, which I believe should have been a priority last offseason. 2. The defense will continue to bleed run yards, though I’m holding out some hope for Glen Dorsey (the only almost-healthy NFL-caliber NT on the roster). Not much hope, though. The ILB core was thin to begin with, they drafted no one, they signed no free agents, and they have now lost both starters to injury. There is zero NFL talent left at the ILB position and we will pay for it on run defense. But I was happy to see the emergence of Ray-Ray before his injury. He’s definitely a keeper. 3. The defense is finding some gems in pass defense, notably Rashard Robinson and Jimmie Ward, but I am also excited for Blair, Buckner, Redmond and Armstead to come into their own, especially now that Lynch is back. It takes a year for a DL to get NFL-wise, anyway. I watch the games now for flashes of promise for next year. All in all, counting IR, I see 14-15 ‘keepers’ on defense: Buckner, Armstead, Blair, Dial, Williams, Ward, Tartt, Reid, Brock, Reaser, Robinson, Bowman, Ray-Ray, Lynch, possibly Redmond. That is definitely the core of something worth continuing! 4. The receiving corps (TE and WR) is not a source of joy yet, but this may change as the OL improves, which it will. I had hoped that MacDonald would emerge, but he keeps getting hurt. Kerley is a ‘keeper’, I think. I reckon the bulk of the free agent dollars we Walmart this coming offseason could well be on WRs. 5. ‘Keepers’ on offense seem few: Hyde, Staley, Trent Brown, Tiller, Kilgore, Kerley, Torrey Smith, possibly Macdonald and Garnett (7-9). And let’s not forget Pinion/Nelson on ST. All told, I see a core of 23-27 core players so far. It’s a start. We need another 6-8 ‘keepers’ on offense, 3-4 on defense and a kicker. A good fraction of those missing parts could arrive in free agency and the draft this offseason. As for backups, I think we have plenty of those already. One last thought: So long as Chip Kelly gets the pieces he needs to implement his vision does he even care whether or not they were bought at Walmart?

The sale price is 11.9 times Atotech’s adjusted earnings for last year before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, the companies said in a statement yesterday. Equity for the transaction is to come from buyout funds Carlyle Europe Partners IV and Carlyle Partners VI. Atotech, which had revenue of 1 billion euros (US$1.1 billion) last year, has more than 4,000 employees, mainly in China and Germany. RETAIL Wal-Mart sees flat earnings US retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Thursday predicted that earnings would be flat in fiscal year 2018 as it pumps up investment in e-commerce initiatives. Wal-Mart said earnings for the next fiscal year that begins on Feb. 1 next year will be essentially unchanged from those of fiscal 2017, which are expected to come in at US$4.15 to US$4.35 a share. The company forecasted an overall capital budget of US$11 billion in both fiscal 2017 and 2018, down from US$11.5 billion in fiscal 2016. It will open 130 new stores in the US in the current year, down from a prior plan to build 135 to 155 stores. The company expects to build 55 new stores in the US in fiscal 2018. INVESTMENT Norwegian fund posts profit Norway’s US$882 billion sovereign wealth fund, the world’s biggest, returned a profit in the third quarter thanks to strong stock markets, it said yesterday. The fund earned a return of 4 percent in the quarter, or 240 billion Norwegian kroner (US$29.7 billion), beating its benchmark by 0.2 percentage points. In the second quarter the fund booked a profit of 1.3 percent. “Equity investments performed strongest during the quarter with positive returns in all regions. This was the main contributor to the fund’s results,” fund deputy chief executive Trond Grande said in a statement. AVIATION CIT sells leasing unit The CIT Group, a commercial lender, on Thursday agreed to sell its aircraft leasing business to a Chinese-owned competitor for about US$10 billion, signifying a big step by CIT to slim itself down in the face of pressure from investors. CIT is selling its aircraft leasing unit — which owns and manages 334 planes and has an additional 133 on order — to Avolon Holdings Ltd, which is based in Ireland, but is owned by the HNA Group (海航集團) of China. CIT will use the proceeds to pay out more than US$3 billion to its shareholders and to further bolster its balance sheet. RETAIL Seven & i restructuring Seven & i Holdings Co unveiled a restructuring plan to divest struggling department stores and set up a real-estate division, in a bid to focus on boosting profit at its core 7-Eleven business. The new unit, to be created this fiscal year, will explore redeveloping property occupied by under-performing general merchandise stores into housing for seniors or other residential and commercial facilities, company president Ryuichi Isaka said on Thursday. Seven & i also announced a capital alliance with a local retailer and is to transfer three Sogo & Seibu department stores to the partner. Seven & i Holdings shares yesterday fell the most in three months in Tokyo trading in the wake of the plan’s announcement. This story has been viewed 1238 times. Comments will be moderated.

Stock Market Showdown: Target vs. Wal-Mart U.S. News & World Report - Money 10/5/2016 Lou Carlozo © (Getty Images) Which mega retailer will come out on top? Though the shelves at your local Target Corporation (TGT) and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) may be stocked well, you still won't find any stock on those shelves – not the kind that makes investors wealthy, anyway. Popular Searches Amgen Inc AMGN ▼ 149.04 -2.53 -1.67% Banc of California Inc BANC ▲ 13.90 +0.05 +0.36% Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 108.43 +0.64 +0.59% Certainly, both companies have far transcended their humble beginnings – Target in suburban St. Paul, Minnesota, and Wal-Mart in Rogers, Arkansas. Yet today, they also stand at a challenging crossroads in a competitive digital age. This year, Target shares are off roughly 8 percent. But as recently as May, the stock was on a tear, up 12 percent from January through April. Then came May's second quarter earnings report, and investors punished Target after it aimed for the bull's-eye but instead hit the bear's behind. While earnings rose 16.5 percent, sales missed forecasts and guidance from the company was glum. Between May 10 and 18, Target stock plunged more than 16 percent; it currently trades close to $69 per share. [See: 7 of the Best Socially Responsible Funds.] Wal-Mart, on the other hand, has enjoyed a steady climb this year, so gradual and sublime you couldn't be blamed if you missed it. The stock, now trading at $72, is up more than 17 percent in 2016. Wal-Mart has few if any threats so far as copycats to its brick-and-mortar model, though its Sam's Club has a very close competitor in by Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST). Yet like Target, Wal-Mart faces stiff headwinds from other corners of the retail sphere. Thus, there's a strange apples-to-oranges parity between the two, and you don't have to hit the produce section to spot it. "While Target struggles to maintain a more than 6 percent lead over Wal-Mart in profit margin, Wal-Mart struggles to stay above the water from the inescapable e-commerce threat from Amazon.com (AMZN)," says K.C. Ma, director of the George Investments Institute at Stetson University in DeLand, Florida. Indeed, Amazon continues to dominate all things e-commerce, and passed Wal-Mart in July of last year as the world's largest retailer. But that's not to say Wal-Mart has given up on the digital front – in fact, far from it. Wal-Mart hopes to grow its online sales around 20 to 30 percent in the near term by leveraging its tremendous distribution platform to support digital sales growth. Still, the explosion of e-commerce sets up a curious scenario where Wal-Mart and Target could face unlikely competitors: themselves. If nothing else, sales growth numbers may shed some light on where the companies stand. Figures provided by the investment analytics and financial research firm FactSet show sales growth hasn't been the best of stories for either Wal-Mart or Target. Since January 2013, Target has seen its growth decline from 4.9 percent to 1.6 percent in January of this year. Over the same period, Wal-Mart fell from 5.7 percent to -0.7 percent. Looking ahead, it's not much better: FactSet numbers project that by January 2017, Wal-Mart will inch up to 1 percent sales growth – while Target will slide 5.6 percent. "By investing $2 billion in labor, health care and employee training for next two years, the benefit is immediate: Wal-Mart shareholders have been rewarded 5 percent for last six months," Ma says. Target, citing improvements "not recognized by the market," has seen its strategic shift met with returns of -4 percent. But at least on the social media front – a metric that holds one key to retail success – Target clearly holds the lead. NetBase's "Social Media Industry Report 2016: Retail Brands," examined the overall performance of 60 leading retail brands across social channels. On the one hand, the social analytics company found Target and Wal-Mart close in terms of social outreach. "Target was second in mentions and Wal-Mart fourth," says Paige Leidig, CMO at NetBase. "Target's reach, mentions and awareness ranks were all comparable. But Target's brand passion index ranking was 41st while Wal-Mart's was 51st, suggesting that Target conversation was both more positive and more passionate." No. 1 on the mentions rank? Amazon. Tiffany and Co. (TIF) scored tops in the brand passion category. But if there were such thing as the broker passion index, the luxury jeweler would hold all the appeal of cubic zirconia: TIF stock is off almost 4 percent for the year. Meanwhile, the rise of dollar stores proves that some outlets can out-bargain a Wal-Mart or Target bargain. Wall Street types are definitely noticing: Dollar General Corp. (DG) in particular was high octane, up 26 percent this year until August. A disappointing earnings report tripped up DG stock, but nine out of 20 analysts still rate it a "strong buy." What's more, TGT and WMT stand apart from their retail peers for dubious reasons. Both have been dogged in recent years by bad publicity and a costly aftermath. Target's big data breach of 2013 whacked 40 million customers, and almost singlehandedly accelerated the adoption of EMV chip-based credit cards in the U.S. (Yes, Target takes them.) All told, the breach cost Target $252 million. Yet that's chump change compared to the setbacks Wal-Mart weathered after getting drubbed for its draconian labor practices. In response, the company enacted reforms that began last year and will increase wages by a total of $2.7 billion. And while that has made the worker bees happier, market watchers consider it quite the buzzkill. After the breach, Target made a smart move to right the ship. New CEO Brian Cornell, who came on board in August 2014, closed Target's underperforming Canadian operation and focused on transparency with the U.S. customer base. Cornell has also heralded a shift to a more focused consumer strategy and it's working, Ma says: "While Wal-Mart has been struggled to find the sweet spot to match the right prices and quality of products to carry, Target has returned to smaller, healthier, high-end stores with higher profit margins. So which mega retailer holds the advantage in the end? In the spirit of the political season, Ma makes his forecast: "Forward-looking valuation models suggest that WMT has a fair value around $80, approximately 9 percent undervalued. TGT has a fair value of $74 with 7 percent undervaluation," he says. "So if the election happened today, Wal-Mart would win."

(KOIN) – The man accused of opening fire inside a Subway restaurant inside a Hazel Dell Walmart is facing charges. Shaun Sprague appeared in Clark County court on Thursday where he was charged with three counts of first-degree assault and one count of first-degree arson. On Wednesday, Clark County deputies say that Sprague walked into the Walmart along Highway 99 around 6:11 a.m., armed with a revolver. At 6:54 a.m., he was contacted by the Subway manager. The manager walked away and when behind the counter, according to court documents. “At that time, Sprague points the revolver [at the manager],” court documents state. Sprague lowered the gun, but then pointed it at the manager a second time. At that point, the manager fled. As the manager ran away, Sprague turned to a group of pumpkins that had been set up inside the store and fired “multiple rounds inside the store.” The shooting was all captured on video. Detectives learned that Sprague wanted to buy a sandwich but was told the restaurant didn’t open until 7 a.m. The manager told investigators that he recalled hearing 6 initial shot followed by 2 more shots. When law enforcement arrived, Sprague was taken into custody without incident. No one was hurt. He told detectives that he had owned the gun for about 5 years, according to court documents. “Sprague advised [detectives] he had been cold and wet when he went inside of the Walmart,” according to court documents. “He advised that he had planned on killing himself while there but changed his mind.” While Sprague was sitting inside a jail holding cell, he told an investigator that he had used “speed” a couple days ago. He said, “none of this would have happened before I used that [redacted.]” The arson charge that Sprague faces stems from a separate incident that occurred Tuesday night in the 3000 block of Northeast 75th. Investigators say that Sprague started a kitchen fire and then found the gas line to the home’s water heater disconnected. Records show that Sprague lived at the residence and his roommate was home and had to put the fire out with water. Sprague is due back in court later this month.

Matthew Heller October 7, 2016 | CFO.com | US share Tweet Email Print - Print + Email this article To* Please enter your email address* Subject* Comments* Wal-Mart has almost doubled its stake in JD.com, becoming the third-largest shareholder in China’s second-largest e-commerce company. In a regulatory filing, Wal-Mart disclosed it now owns 265 million shares in JD.com, or 10.8% of shares that don’t have extra voting power, up from the 5.9% stake it obtained by selling Yihaodian, its Chinese online marketplace, to JD in June. Recommended Stories: Adobe Buys Ad Tech Firm TubeMogul for $540M Windstream to Buy Dial-Up Pioneer Earthlink Wanda Group Buys Dick Clark Productions for $1B The increased stake is just short of the level that would allow Wal-Mart to gain observer status at JD.com’s board meetings. JD’s two largest shareholders are Tencent, China’s dominant social networking company, which has a stake of 21.25%, and founder Liu Qiangdong, who owns 16.2%. “The stepped-up investment in JD has been part of our plan, as we continue to be a passive investor,” a a Wal-Mart spokeswoman said. “We believe this strategic alliance will help us grow e-commerce even faster in China.” As The Wall Street Journal reports, the sale of Yihaodian reflected Wal-Mart’s shift in strategy to “seeking to navigate China’s competitive e-commerce market as an investor in a major local player, rather than trying to expand its own online shopping platform.” “China has surpassed the U.S. as the world’s largest e-commerce market. But it is a challenging market for foreign players, as the country’s fast-growing online shopping sector is dominated by domestic competitors like JD.com and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., China’s largest e-commerce company,” the WSJ explained. At JD’s closing price of $27.40 on Thursday, Wal-Mart’s stake was worth more than $7.2 billion. Last month, the retailer was reportedly in advanced talks with India e-commerce company Flipkart for an investment of about $1 billion.

Экономика 2016-10-07T09:22+02:00 09:22 07.10.2016 S&P 500 вырос в четверг, Dow и Nasdaq закрылись в минусе Динамика фондовых индексов США в четверг была слабовыраженной и разнонаправленной, инвесторы ждут новых данных по рынку труда, которые могут повлиять на темпы повышения базовой процентной ставки Федеральной резервной системой (ФРС) США. Число заявок на пособие по безработице в США неожиданно снизилось на прошлой неделе на 5 тыс. и составило 249 тыс., говорится в отчете министерства труда США. Показатель близок к рекордно низкой отметке с 1973 года. Аналитики Уолл-стрит в среднем ожидали увеличения показателя на 2 тыс., с 254 тыс. до 256 тыс. Важнейшим статистическим отчетом текущей недели будет публикация министерством труда США сентябрьских данных о безработице. Опрошенные MarketWatch эксперты в среднем ожидают увеличения числа рабочих мест в США в прошлом месяце на 169 тыс. (151 тыс. в августе). В среду глава Федерального резервного банка Ричмонда Джеффри Лэкер заявил, что текущие экономические условия в США обеспечивают сильные аргументы в пользу более быстрого повышения процентных ставок. Между тем нефть WTI в четверг превысила отметку $50 за баррель впервые с 24 июня, завершив сессию на отметке $50,44 за баррель. Курс акций крупнейшего ритейлера США Wal-Mart Stores Inc. опустился на 3,2% на торгах в Нью-Йорке из-за слабых прогнозов прибыли. Wal-Mart ожидает нулевого изменения прибыли в 2018 фингоду по сравнению с 2017 (текущим) фингодом, который завершается в январе. На текущий фингод компания подтвердила прогноз чистой прибыли от $4,29 до $4,49 на акцию, скорректированной прибыли - от $4,15 до $4,35 на акцию. Аналитики в среднем прогнозировали более высокую скорректированную прибыль Wal-Mart: в этом году на уровне $4,34 на акцию, в следующем - $4,48 на акцию. Рыночная стоимость Twitter Inc. рухнула на 20% на сообщениях о том, что Apple, Google и Walt Disney не заинтересованы в покупке сервиса микроблогов. При этом акции Salesforce.com Inc., которая по-прежнему планирует приобрести Twitter, подорожали на 4,2%, возглавляя подъем в рамках S&P 500. Бумаги Yum Brands Inc. подешевели на 1,2%, поскольку квартальная отчетность компании, которой принадлежат сети ресторанов KFC, Taco Bell и Pizza Hut, была слабее прогнозов. Индекс биотехнологических компаний iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF упал на 2,3%. Котировки ценных бумаг производителя оружия Smith & Wesson опустились на 3,6%. Аналитики Wunderlich Securities ухудшили оценку стоимости акций с $36 до $29 в связи с опасениями сокращения спроса на продукцию компании. Цена бумаг производителя электромобилей Tesla Motor Co. уменьшилась на 3,6%. Эксперты Golgman Sachs пересмотрели оценку акций Tesla с $240 до $185. Индекс Dow Jones Industrial Average по итогам торгов в четверг опустился на 12,53 пункта (0,07%) и составил 18268,50 пункта.

Investors abstained from making big bets ahead of Friday's much-anticipated September jobs report. Stocks sold off in early trade, but the market recouped much of its losses after a high-ranking European Central Bank official repudiated reports that the central bank had discussed tapering its bond-buying program.Aside from central bank policies and economic data, earnings are looming as an important market driver. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 12.53 points to finish at 18,268.50. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 9.17 points, or 0.2%, to close at 5,306.85, pressured by losses in biotechs. The S&P 500 index edged up 1.04 points to close at 2,160.77, with the materials sector topping the gains. Sharp losses in Wal-Mart Stores and American Express weighed on the blue-chip benchmark. Wal-Mart Stores shares fell 3.2% after the retailer provided a lackluster outlook for 2017 at an investor meeting. Wal-Mart is a component of both the S&P 500 and the Dow industrials. Trading was generally tepid as investors awaited Friday's jobs data, which will help them gauge the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of 2016. Ahead of the jobs report, Thursday's weekly jobless claims report pointed to extremely low levels of layoffs, suggesting that employers are reluctant to part with workers in a tight market. Meanwhile, ECB Vice President Victor Constancio reportedly said there is no consensus to wind down bond purchases. There were earlier reports this week that bank officials had reached an informal consensus to taper the ECB's quantitative-easing efforts sooner than expected. The denial from the ECB is in keeping with market expectations that the ECB is reluctant to exit its quantitative-easing program and that it is more inclined to extend its loose monetary policy stance beyond March. Mr. Constancio briefly rallied global bond markets when he denied reports from earlier in the week that suggested the central bank has held discussions about tapering its asset purchase program. That headline boost proved to be short-lived, however, as Treasury prices soon started to fade again, pushing yields back up. Today's economic data was limited to Challenger Job Cuts for September and weekly initial claims. September Challenger Job Cuts reported in at 44,300, which compares to the prior month's reading of 32,200. For the week ending 1 October, initial claims decreased by 5,000 to 249,000 (consensus 258,000). Continuing claims for the week ending September 24 fell by 6,000 to 2.058 million. Economic data showed that the number of people who applied for unemployment benefits fell by 5,000 to 249,000 in the final week of September, which bodes well for a strong payrolls number. The yield on the benchmark 10-yr note, which slipped back to 1.71% after the Constancio headline first hit, finished higher by four basis points at 1.74%. Third-quarter earnings season will kick off unofficially on Tuesday with Alcoa's results. Oil futures continued to climb, trading above $50 a barrel for the first time in four months. Gold futures retreated as a key dollar index gained. European stocks fell while Asian markets closed higher. Today's participation was below the recent average as more than 796 million shares changed hands at the NYSE floor. Tomorrow's economic data will include the 8:30 a.m. ET release of the Employment Situation Report for September. The consensus expects the report to show an increase of 176,000 in nonfarm payrolls. Meanwhile, August Wholesale Inventories (consensus -0.1%) and August Consumer Credit (consensus$18.0 billion) will cross the wires at 10:00 a.m ET and 3:00 p.m. ET, respectively.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc plans to slow its new store openings and pour more money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels, the company said on Thursday. The world's largest retailer also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings-per-share growth of about five per cent. Wal-Mart completed its more than US$3-billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer, Jet.com, last month, showing how heavily it's willing to invest to boost online sales that totalled US$13.7 billion last year - still just a fraction of its annual revenue. "This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company," CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company's annual investment meeting. Like its direct store rivals, Wal-Mart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com, whose Prime shopping programme is swiftly converting members into loyal shoppers. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. But Wal-Mart has seen its investments online and in the stores pay off - and it's starting to gain ground over some of the competitors. It has launched a flurry of changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. The company has 150 fresh-food managers working to train store sales associates. Online grocery shopping Wal-Mart is also melding online services with its massive fleet of stores. It rolled out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it's pushing ahead with online grocery and pickup services. Greg Foran, CEO and president of Wal-Mart's US namesake business, told analysts on Thursday that by the end of the year, it will have grocery online pickup services at 600 US stores. The company is in the second year of its US$2.7-billion investment in its workers that involves higher pay and more training. It says that such investments as well as the other moves are already helping to improve customer service in the stores. Wal-Mart had raised its annual profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth straight quarterly increase in revenue of stores opened at least a year and the seventh quarterly gain in customer traffic at its namesake Wal-Mart US business. Global online sales rose 11.8 per cent in the second quarter. That's up from the seven per cent pace of the first quarter but still far weaker than the 20 per cent increases from less than two years ago. McMillon reiterated to analysts on Thursday that he believes the Jet.com acquisition will help it attract higher-income and younger customers. The company plans to incorporate some of Jet.com's technology that lowers prices in real time. As part of the deal, Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, is overseeing both the site and Walmart.com. "I look around and see the vast assets," Lore told investors on Thursday. "This is the perfect time to accelerate the business." Foran said that Lore will be working to increasingly get the store and online selections to match, so if customers see something in the store, they'll know they can find it online. Increasing stake in JD.com The retailer still has plenty of challenges, notably in China, and it's struggling in the United Kingdom and Brazil. It announced on Wednesday that it was increasing its stake in JD.com, China's No. 2 e-commerce site, to 10.8 per cent from 5.9 per cent. That comes nearly four months after Wal-Mart bought an initial stake in JD.com in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of the Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian, including the brand and app. Wal-Mart said on Thursday it would spend US$11 billion on capital expenditures this year, and the same for the following fiscal year. In the fiscal year ended in January, the company spent US$11.5 billion on capital expenditures. But Wal-Mart said it will be investing more of that money in e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company also said that it plans to open 130 US stores this year, but that's below its forecast issued last year that it would open 135 to 155 new stores. In its last fiscal year, it opened 230 US stores. It said it plans to open another 55 US stores next year. Wal-Mart reiterated that its earnings per share for the current year on an adjusted basis would be US$4.15 per share to US$4.35 per share on an adjusted basis. - AP «[node:title] Haiti to get US$20m insurance payout» View the discussion thread.

New York: WalMart Stores Inc. plans to slow its new store openings and pour more money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels, the company said Thursday. The world's largest retailer completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it's willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year - still just a fraction of its annual revenue. "This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company," CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company's annual investment meeting. WalMart also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. The company's shares fell $2.12, or 3 percent, to $69.55 in afternoon trading. Still, the outlook wasn't as bad as a year ago, when executives said earnings per share could fall 6 percent to 12 percent this year because of investments in higher salaries and e-commerce. That day, Walmart shares plunged 10 percent. But WalMart's flurry of moves - online and in the stores - have been gaining traction, and its shares were up 17 percent this year ahead of the meeting. Like its direct store rivals, WalMart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. Walmart launched a number of changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. The company has 150 fresh food managers working to train sales associates. The company is also melding online services with its massive fleet of stores. It rolled out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it's pushing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. Greg Foran, CEO and president of Walmart's U.S. namesake business, told analysts Thursday that by the end of the year, it will have grocery online pickup services at 600 U.S. stores. Walmart had raised its annual profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth straight quarterly increase in revenue of stores opened at least a year. In contrast, rival Target reported that a key revenue measure was down 1.1 percent in the second quarter, after seven straight quarters of gains. And it saw fewer customers in the store for the first time in a year and a half. Walmart's online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter - up from 7 percent in the first quarter but still trailing the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago. Officials said Thursday they believe its global online sales will be up 20 percent to 30 percent in the second half of this year. Walmart also reiterated that its earnings per share for the current year on an adjusted basis would be $4.15 per share to $4.35 per share on an adjusted basis. McMillon stressed to analysts Thursday that he believes the Jet.com acquisition will help the company attract higher-income and younger customers. Walmart plans to incorporate some of Jet.com's technology that lowers prices in real time. As part of the deal, Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, is overseeing both the site and Walmart.com. "I look around and see the vast assets," Lore told investors Thursday. "This is the perfect time to accelerate the business." Foran said that Lore will be working to increasingly get the store and online selections to match, so if customers see something in the store, they'll know they can find it online. The retailer still has plenty of challenges. Analysts questioned whether the price cuts that Walmart is taking will be sustainable as rivals respond. And they asked executives how much profit they would be willing to risk. Walmart had said it is spending several billion dollars in its plans to lower prices, but haven't given any specific details. McMillon declined to talk about how much farther they would be willing to go. Walmart did say Thursday it would spend $11 billion on capital expenditures this year, and the same for the following fiscal year. In the fiscal year ended in January, the company spent $11.5 billion on capital expenditures. But Walmart said it will be investing more of that money in e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company also said it plans to open 130 U.S. stores this year, but that's below its forecast issued last year that it would open 135 to 155 new stores. In its last fiscal year, it opened 230 U.S. stores. It said it plans to open another 55 U.S. stores next year. By type of store, Walmart plans to open 60 supercenters and 70 of the smaller-format Neighborhood Markets this year. For next year, the breakdown is 35 supercenters and 20 smaller-format stores.

Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com As it faces a possible sale or spinoff, the Save-A-Lot grocery store chain is boosting the number of national brands on its shelves, remodeling to highlight fresh foods and adding stores. The changes underway at some of the discount chain’s 1,368 stores nationwide come as the Earth City-based grocer is poised to change ownership and as its discount chain rivals Wal-Mart and Ruler Foods are adding stores and services in the St. Louis region, vying for market share. Eden Prairie, Minn.-based Supervalu, which owns Save-A-Lot, is exploring spinning off Save-A-Lot as a stand-alone company or a sale of the chain amid increased competition and declines in prices for eggs, pork, beef and other foods. Reuters reported last week that Toronto private equity firm Onex Corp. was the leading bidder if Supervalu pursues a sale of Save-A-Lot, with a sale value of up to $1.8 billion. Supervalu is expected to announce Save-A-Lot’s fate soon, according to Reuters. The company did not respond to requests seeking comment. In a regulatory filing this summer, Save-A-Lot said if it’s spun off, its headquarters would remain in Earth City. Private label foods, which are sold under store brands, account for 60 percent of sales at Save-A-Lot’s corporate-owned stores and 55 percent at its licensee stores. Founded as a single store in Cahokia in 1977, the chain’s business model has centered on offering low-priced alternatives to national brands but it’s expanding its lineup of national brands. The company said this year that all of its corporate stores and most of its licensed stores recently started carrying 130 “must have” national brand items in a bid to attract and maintain new customers. Save-A-Lot’s private label offerings include maple syrup and biscuits sold under its own “Morning Delight” brand. “Private label branding at Save-A-Lot has no brand equity with consumers,” said Ajay Jain, a senior analyst at Pivitol Research Group in New York. To attract more brand-conscious customers, Save-A-Lot is carrying more national brands and consolidating its myriad private label offerings to one primary brand, America’s Choice, which it acquired earlier this year. “Over time, we expect that America’s Choice will become the predominant food private label brand in our stores as we seek to consolidate our private label brand offerings by reducing the number of private label brands that we offer while increasing brand recognition and enhancing brand equity,” the company said in the regulatory filing. Save-A-Lot’s current ads show an expanded array of national brands available, including Maxwell House coffee, Totino’s pizza rolls and Lay’s potato chips. “The American consumer does appreciate and demand their brands,” Supervalu’s president and CEO Mark Gross told analysts at the RBC Capital Markets Consumer and Retail Conference in Boston in June, referring to Save-A-Lot’s changes. While it adds brands, Save-A-Lot also said it plans to open 75 new stores in fiscal 2017, and “we believe the United States can support more than 3,500 Save-A-Lot stores under our existing store concept and layout,” according to the filing. The grocer also is remodeling its stores to bring its produce departments closer to the front of each store, expanding its fresh cut meat offerings, adding more ethnic foods and expanding its frozen and smoked meat departments. “The merchandising could use a shot in the arm,” Jain said of the remodels the chain is pursuing. “The stores were pretty tired looking.” Changing landscape Save-A-Lot is under pressure from rivals that are also expanding their food options, including Wal-Mart, which has been growing its Walmart Neighborhood Markets chain nationally and locally.

SOURCE: Chain Store Guide’s 2016 Grocery Industry Market Share Report Post-Dispatch Walmart Neighborhood Markets have about 41,000 square feet of space, and the grocery stores have fresh produce, pharmacy, deli and bakery departments. That size makes them smaller than most Schnucks stores, but larger than Save-A-Lot’s average 17,000-square-foot store. At the Walmart Neighborhood Market at 45 Sutters Mill Road in St. Peters, customers can order groceries online and have them delivered curbside to their cars, beginning Nov. 9. Wal-Mart said it plans to have online order pickup available at 600 stores by the end of the year. +5  FILE PHOTO: Chris Krehmeyer, president and CEO of Beyond Housing, pushes a grocery cart holding Diamond Rhymes (center), 4, in 2010 to mark the grand opening of the Save-A-Lot grocery store in Pagedale.

Check our People in Business Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher Combined, Walmart’s Supercenters, Neighborhood Markets and Sam’s Club stores have 28.7 percent market share of grocery sales in the St. Louis region, according to Chain Store Guide’s 2016 Grocery Industry Market Share Report, which reflects fiscal year 2015 sales. Included in Chain Store Guide’s definition of the St. Louis market are the Illinois counties of Bond, Calhoun, Clinton, Jersey, Macoupin, Madison, Monroe and St. Clair; and the Missouri counties of Jefferson, Lincoln, St. Charles, St. Louis, St. Louis city and Warren. In 2014, Wal-Mart’s local share totaled 28.8 percent. Wal-Mart may put the brakes on adding stores, however. The retailer said Thursday that it plans to slow down its store openings to focus on online sales, store remodels and tech initiatives. Maryland Heights-based Schnuck Markets Inc., the largest locally based, independently owned grocer, has 23.7 percent market share, a drop from 23.9 percent in 2014, according to Chain Store Guide. Supervalu’s Save-A-Lot chain and another chain it owns, Kirkwood-based Shop ’n Save, combined have 13.2 market share — the report does not break down the figures for each chain. Chesterfield-based Dierbergs comes in fourth, with 10 percent market share. Other chains that are expanding include German-based Aldi, which opened its newest St. Louis area store in Shrewsbury this week and plans to open a location in Wentzville early next year. Aldi had 3.4 percent market share in St. Louis last year, down slightly from 3.6 percent. One of the biggest increases in local market share came from Cincinnati-based Kroger Co., which re-entered the St. Louis market under a subsidiary’s Ruler Foods brand in 2014. Ruler, which has added seven local stores in the past year, now has nine St. Louis area stores. Ruler Foods grew its market share in St. Louis to 3.3 percent in 2015, up from 1.9 percent a year earlier. “We’re constantly looking at sites,” Ruler Foods’ executive director of merchandising, Mark Belleville, said of St. Louis. “We’re very happy with what is happening in the market and how customers are accepting us. We want to continue to grow.” About 85 percent of Ruler Foods’ merchandise is private label, many under the Kroger brand. Belleville said Ruler Foods stocks Kroger-branded food items, which resonate with customers who remember when the chain had stores here in the mid-1980s. “There are people who tell us it’s like an old friend coming home,” Belleville said.

Walmart's CEO just signaled a massive change to its business model Business Insider 10/7/2016 Hayley Peterson © Scott Olson/Getty Images   Walmart is shifting its business model. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 71.23 -0.16 -0.22% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 739.01 -3.37 -0.45% Going forward, the nation's largest retailer doesn't want to be defined by its stores. "This company, over time, is going to look like more of an ecommerce company," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Thursday at Walmart's annual investor day in Bentonville, Arkansas. He said stores will remain vital to Walmart's future. But the company will be cutting back on new store growth, focusing more on same-store sales — or sales at stores open at least a year — and growing investments in ecommerce. Walmart will open 130 US stores this year, down slightly from the 135 to 155 stores it had originally projected, and also down from the 230 stores that were opened last year.  Next year, it will open just 55 US stores, half of which will be its smaller-format Neighborhood Market stores.  In the meantime, Walmart has doubled its online fulfillment warehouses in the last year to 10, Reuters reports. Industry experts had expected Walmart to have just eight warehouses by the end of 2018. Walmart is trying to transform into an ecommerce company to better compete with Amazon, which had $107 billion in online sales last year, compared to Walmart's $13.7 billion in online sales in the period. © Provided by Business Insider Walmart CEO Doug McMillon But the majority of Walmart's business still comes from its stores.  The company's total revenue last year was $482 billion, meaning more than 97% of its business came from stores.  Now watch: Walmart is working on a self-driving shopping cart Click to expand Replay Video This retailer is closing nearly all of its stores: report Kenneth Cole will reportedly close most of its stores in the next six months.

He just moved here from Louisiana. "She's getting a little older and my brothers are in the service, so I was like the only one left,” Brumfield said. Before Brumfield gets inside he’s stopped by people with clipboards. Staff and volunteers are here with the New Georgia Project, a non-profit. They’re focused on registering minority voters, but they don’t turn anybody away. This neighborhood is about 75 percent African-American. Brumfield just signed up. He said he’s voting for the good of his three boys. "I had it hard coming up, so I know what it's like. I'd rather them have a better chance than I did,” Brumfield said. Between work and family, Brumfield doesn’t have a lot of time, and said he might not have registered if it weren’t for what he calls the “curbside service” at the Wal-Mart. If this is a drive-thru for voter registration, the New Georgia Project is best known for its delivery service. Half of its registration work is door-to-door canvassing.   “That’s expensive work,”  said Stacey Abrams, Georgia’s democratic house minority leader, and the founder of the New Georgia Project. “For a lot of the states where this work could be done, they simply don't have the resources,” she said. In many places it's expensive to find and register voters, and that leaves a lot of people out of the democratic process: about one in four Americans. Some states make it easier than others. Oregon voters are now automatically registered when they renew or apply for a license at the DMV.  Minnesota allows voters to register as late as Election Day. But in other places, civic groups do much of the legwork to register voters ahead of earlier deadlines. That’s the case in Georgia. Abrams said the New Georgia Project is unique because it does the labor-intensive work of finding voters at their homes. “These are folks no one talks to,” said Abrams. “You've got pay literally hundreds of people to go and knock on doors and stand in the hot sun in July in Georgia and get people to engage.” Stacey Abrams, the founder of the New Georgia Project, says Democracy benefits from more people being involved in the electoral process.  - Johnny Kauffman/WABE The group’s registration effort has attracted harsh scrutiny from both Democrats and Republicans. In 2014, Georgia’s Republican Secretary of State opened an ongoing investigation into the New Georgia Project over allegations it submitted fraudulent voter applications. A counter-suit by the group, alleging voter suppression, was thrown out. Some Democrats said the New Georgia Project should be signing up more people, given the amount of money it has raised from private donors. Brennan Mancil, chairman of the Georgia Association of College Republicans, said registration is a focus for Republicans too. “You have to involve people who are going to be the voting base of the future, and by and large that’s going to be Hispanics, blacks, and to a lesser degree than now, whites,” he said.   Mancil said his group registers voters in student centers, and at debate watch parties. Those kinds of high-traffic areas are the most common and most efficient way to sign people up.  But it can be expensive to try and find people who don’t have stable housing, a listed address or a phone, according to Bradley Spahn, a Stanford graduate student who studies unregistered voters. “Even if we wanted to register them we wouldn’t be able to find contact information for them, we wouldn’t know how to register them, because we would never know they existed,” said Spahn. Democrats probably have the most to gain from registering those hard-to-find voters, who tend to more liberal, said Spahn, but in addition to being costly, it takes time. “Party politics is run by short-term considerations. Campaigns disappear in the middle of November,” Spahn said. Back at the Wal-Mart, the New Georgia Project’s long-term plan is paying off, at least with Wayne Brumfield.  He’ll be casting a vote for himself, but with his young sons in mind.   “I have an 11, an eight, and a six-year-old, so it will be a while before they get a chance to do that,” said Brumfield.    Many voter registration deadlines are in October, though they vary from state to state.

Music News Entertainment Politics Features Share < br />this article: Donald Trump called Melania a ‘blimp’ during her pregnancy In Politics by April Siese / October 8, 2016 Share < br />this article: Follow @ayetalian Donald Trump is having more receipts presented to him than a return center clerk at a Walmart. As soon as the Washington Post released audio footage of the Republican nominee making lewd comments from a 2005 “Access Hollywood” bus ride with host Billy Bush, journalists went scrambling for more material. Turns out Trump has quite the paper trail. Audio clip after clip after video footage after quote have surfaced painting the presidential hopeful to be even more reprehensible than we thought he was. A shining example is the way he talked about his wife, Melania, when she was pregnant with their now 10-year-old son, Barron. The disparaging remarks come courtesy of a Howard Stern Show appearance from Dec. 2005. Proving he probably doesn’t fuck as much as he claims and that he has literally no knowledge of how pregnancy works, the Donald told Howard Stern that it’s common knowledge that women turn into bloated monsters as soon as they’re knocked up. “You know, they just blow up, right? Like a blimp,” Trump explains. “In the right places. In her case, the right places. I mean she really has become a monster.” Thank god Melania’s weight was distributed in an aesthetically pleasing manner for the Donald. It certainly makes no difference whether she or her child are healthy, so long as Trump can still pop a boner to the thought of his engorged wife. Not that it matters. Trump’s “grab them by the pussy” comments were made just eight months after he’d married Melania. His sexist slams against his wife occurred three months after that. For those of you playing along at home, Donald Trump tried to fuck a married woman while also being married, explicitly stated he couldn’t control himself when it comes to sexual assault, and called his pregnant wife a monster—and that’s in 2005 alone. Imagine the other terrible shit he’s said between then and… oh, wait. You don’t have to because the flood gates have opened and we’re drowning in the cess pool that is Donald Trump. Our national nightmare has only gotten worse.

Bloomberg Wal-Mart Stores's increasing reliance on e-commerce to fuel sales comes at a time when Amazon.com is tightening its grip on the American consumer, making it a risky gambit.   Wal-Mart told investors Thursday it would pull back on the number of new stores it was opening and instead invest some of that money into online operations. It's a key milestone: For the first time, the company expects e-commerce gains to contribute more toward its growth than expanding its brick-and-mortar footprint. Analysts and investors are skeptical that Wal-Mart can pull it off. Consumers are rapidly getting ingrained in the habit of turning to Amazon for everything from toilet paper to a new dress. Among U.S. online consumers, 55 percent say they go to Amazon first when searching for a product and about half of American households have a $99-a-year Amazon Prime membership. U.S. shoppers spend 30 percent of their time online at Amazon.com's website, compared with 3 percent on Walmart.com. "I get that you have to be in e-commerce, but you are chasing the 800-pound gorilla," said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. "You aren't going to out-Amazon Amazon." Yarbrough worries that Wal-Mart's growth online will mostly be coming from its existing customers -- and as a result will cannibalize its stores, which are more profitable and where customers are more likely to make an impulse buy. At the same time, Amazon has been increasing its reach into Wal-Mart's customer base. Forty-two percent of Amazon Prime members are also Wal-Mart shoppers, compared with just 20 percent in 2013, said John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen & Co. And there are no signs Amazon is slowing down. It is set to add 12 million Prime members this year, on top of the 10 million it added in 2015, Blackledge estimates. With at least 17 times as many items for sale as Walmart.com, Amazon is increasingly expanding its reach into areas once dominated by traditional retailers. This year, Amazon is set to sell more apparel than Wal-Mart, and by 2018 it will be the second-largest seller of consumables, such as cleaning suppliers, paper towels and diapers, Blackledge said. Then there is Amazon's ever-increasing delivery speed. While Wal-Mart is in the early stages of offering a membership program where customers can get free two-day shipping -- rather than waiting the standard five to seven days -- Amazon is offering free same-day delivery in 27 major cities. In some markets, the e-commerce company delivers millions of products within an hour. "To compete, Wal-Mart would have to replicate the value proposition of Prime," Blackledge said. "If they could do that at scale, then they would have something, but Amazon has been singularly focused at this for 20 years." None of that should be news to Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon. He knows the company has a lofty goal in front of it, but since paying about $3.3 billion for e-commerce startup Jet.com, McMillon seemed to have a bit more spring in his step when talking to investors about the company's online strategy. "A lot of the foundational elements that we've been telling you for years that we needed to grow the e-commerce business are now in place," McMillon said. "It's time to invest more money. It's time to really get this going and start growing our e-commerce business in a different way." That new way will be led by tech-industry darling Marc Lore, who founded Jet.com and joined Wal-Mart following the acquisition. McMillon sees him as key to the company's future. The CEO half-jokingly recalled walking down the street with Lore and instinctively stepping out in front of an oncoming car to protect him. "If Marc can be Marc within this company, great things are going to happen," McMillon said. Wal-Mart expects online sales to grow 20 percent to 30 percent over the next three years with the addition of Jet. That would be a major acceleration: Online sales grew 7 percent in the first quarter and 12 percent in the second. But even 20 percent growth on a base of about $13 billion does little to move the needle at a company with nearly $500 billion in annual revenue. In the meantime, the investments are taking a toll on Wal-Mart's bottom line. The company said profit would be flat next year in part because of the heavy spending online. Wal-Mart shares fell 3.2 percent Thursday when the retailer's executives made their case to investors, and the stock was down an additional 1.2 percent on Friday. The question is whether Wal-Mart can change the shopping behavior of the tens of millions of Americans already entrenched in Amazon. Is Wal-Mart the retail equivalent of Microsoft's Bing, which tried and failed to convince Americans to break their habit of going to Google? Or can Wal-Mart -- with Jet.com -- be a disruptive force in the industry? "If someone is locked into Prime, the chance of you bringing their business over is slim," Yarbrough said. Wal-Mart's main selling point has been its physical stores, which let shoppers buy items online and pick them up on the premises. That includes having employees deliver groceries to customers' cars in the parking lot. Wal-Mart also can use its stores as a shipping point, helping it lower delivery costs. Jet.com may help give it an advantage on price. The startup has developed a system where customers pay less if they are ordering items from the same location or if they opt out of services, like the option to return the item. Lore also said using store pickup could help cut shipping costs. But adapting to the internet isn't really a choice -- it's an imperative. And that's something Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton would recognize, McMillon said on Thursday. "The Internet and technology are changing the world, they are changing industries, and they're changing retail," he said. "Sometimes people ask me what would Sam think about what Wal-Mart is going today, and I don't know. But the one thing I know for sure is we would be changing and we'd be changing quickly."

TrendsViral Juan Martinez and his wife Guadalupe Martinez were 73 and 69, respectively, when they were both arrested at their local Wal-Mart on October 3, 2014, in an incident which escalated to a physical altercation with a local officer. The incident was filmed on the cop’s bodycam. The couple, who both use mobility scooters, were shopping at the Old San Antonio Road store when they became separated, and the woman exited the store with unpurchased items still in her scooter’s basket. Wal-Mart security then detained her on suspicion of shoplifting, leading her into an office for questioning. The newly released bodycam footage shows Buda police officer Demerriel Young ask Juan to leave the office while his wife is being questioned. However, he refused, saying: "No sir, I'm not going to do that." “I've done nothing wrong,” he added. “Okay either you're gonna step outside or I'm going to place you outside or I'm going to place you under arrest for interfering," Young warned, to which Juan replied: “Go ahead.” The video shows Young proceed to place his hands on the older man, who falls to the ground and lies there, apparently screaming in pain. Young then stops Guadalupe from helping her prone husband and she accuses the officer of pushing him. "Have a seat, ma'am. I did not do anything," says Young. "You pushed him," she responds. Guadalupe was subsequently charged with theft while Juan was charged with interfering with the duties of a public servant. They are both reportedly due in court on October 17.

By Patrick Abdalla / Published: October 8, 2016 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     PLAINS TWP. — Tracy Morgan saw the light. He said he ran from it, thinking it was the police. The Emmy-nominated star didn’t shy away from talking about his 2014 crash during a set at Mohegan Sun Pocono on Friday night. The audience didn’t mind hearing about it through Morgan’s colorful and outrageous language. Morgan was nearly killed in 2014 when a Wal-Mart truck struck the vehicle he was riding in. He said every bone in his face had been broken, his femur had been pulverized. The six vehicle crash killed one of Morgan’s friends, James McNair. “After that settlement, the prices went up a penny,” he said. While he made light of the crash, he also impressed on the crowd how tragic it was. He pointed out how thankful he was for his family, even though many of the members were the butts of several of his funniest jokes. He also said how thankful he was for the doctors, who put him back together. “It could have been worse,” Morgan said. “It could have been Bob’s Discount Furniture Truck.” “When I was in that wheelchair, I still shopped at Wal-Mart,” he added. Morgan first caught the nation’s eye with his energetic and brash performances as a cast member on “Saturday Night Live” from 1996 to 2003. He gained more fans when he moved to primetime in a starring role as the chaotic, impetuous and childlike Tracy Jordan in “30 Rock” opposite Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin. His character once told a booing audience, “Your boos are not scaring me. I know most of you are not ghosts.” During his act on Friday, he joked that he met several people during his short stay in heaven, like Biggie Smalls and Elvis. “Michael Jackson told me what really happened,” Jordan said, claiming Jackson died during the filming of a Pepsi commercial and was replaced by a stand-in. Morgan’s show, which couldn’t be completely reviewed because of deadline constraints, included openers Marc Theobald and Tracey Ashley. Audience members had to have their phones placed in locked pouches during the show. Theobald referenced the procedure saying it kept people from videotaping the whole show. “Some of ya’all are going through cellphone withdrawal,” he joked. But the star of the night was Morgan, who seemed touched by the loud applause he got when he took the stage. He waved his right arm in circles and smiled at the crowd. Midway through his set, he talked about how his grandmother, who had marched in the Civil Rights movement, told him he had to do something with his second chance. He told the crowd she wanted him to get his GED. Judging by the smiles and laughter he caused Friday, he was doing something right. pabdalla@citizensvoice.com We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.

Satellite technology tells us exactly how well a business performs Retailers suffer week from hell JCPenney, taking a page from Walmart, Home Depot and other big-box retailers, has started stationing greeters at the entrances of stores, The Post has learned. Penney’s greeters are already full-time employees who are being redeployed to front-of-the-store duty for just two hours of their shift, according to one employee who is serving in such a capacity. The use of greeters is said to be a test and is being deployed just in the Northeast region, the employees said. It rolled out this past summer. The greeters at Walmart and Home Depot are full-time jobs and are used throughout the day. The Penney greeters will be on duty from noon to 2 p.m., the employee said. The retailer, in a memo to employees explaining the new duty, called the time spent as greeters as “power hours.” “We don’t know why it’s from 12 to 2, but we were told it would increase sales,” said the employee, adding that management is also focused on increasing the number of customers who open JCPenney credit-card accounts. The “power hours” are not sitting well with some staffers who, the employee said, feel they come at the price of longer lines at cash registers. “Even the crew that unloads merchandise from trucks had to be on the floor greeting,” the employee said. A check on Friday showed that not every Penney store had greeters. At the Manhattan Mall store, only security guards were manning the entrances — though they greeted customers as well. JCPenney did not return a call for comment.

 This is what the average Walmart shopper looks like Hayley Peterson Oct. 7, 2016, 3:06 PM 22,151 facebook linkedin twitter email print Reuters Walmart is the world's largest retailer. The company has more than 11,500 stores globally, including nearly 4,600 in the US, and raked in $486 billion in sales last year.  But who, exactly, shops there? And how do those shoppers differ from customers at stores like Target, Aldi, Kmart, and Kohl's?  To find out, we gathered data from Kantar Retail's ShopperScape, a proprietary monthly survey that polls thousands of consumers on their shopping habits. According to the data, the average Walmart shopper is a white, 51-year-old female with an annual household income of $56,482.  Kantar Retail/ShopperScape By comparison, Target's shoppers are five years younger, on average, and they make approximately $13,000 more annually per household. Most of the shoppers at each of the five chains are white. Target and Kmart have the highest share of Hispanic shoppers (15%) and Kmart and Aldi have the highest percentage of African-American shoppers (14%). Kantar Retail/ShopperScape Kohl's attracts the highest-income shoppers out of all five retailers. The average household income of Kohl's shoppers is $69,442 annually, and nearly 30% of the chain's shoppers make more than $100,000, according to the data. By comparison, just 18% of Walmart's shoppers earn $100,000 annually per household.  Kantar Retail/ShopperScape On the other end of the income spectrum is Kmart, which attracts shoppers with an average household income of $55,006 — the lowest of the group.   When the demographics are broken down by generation, Target has the biggest share of millennial shoppers, while Aldi has the biggest share of shoppers from the Baby Boomer generation. Aldi also claims the biggest share of seniors, who are qualified as people born before 1946.  Kantar Retail/ShopperScape At all five chains, women far outweigh men as the primary shoppers. But men are more likely to shop at Walmart and Kmart over any of the other chains. Kantar Retail/ShopperScape SEE ALSO: Walmart's CEO just signaled a massive change to its business model More: Retail Walmart Kohl's Kmart Target shoppers Shopping Demographics Aldi shopper demographics facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru This is what the average Walmart shopper looks like This is what the average Walmart shopper looks like Walmart is the world's largest retailer.

Chandrasekaran , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} October 07, 2016 11:38am   Comments Share: Related HON Facebook, Bank Of America, Honeywell: Fast Money Picks For November 11 Can Trump Make Your Portfolio Great Again? Shares from the industrial conglomerate are under pressure after Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE: HON) provided a downbeat forecast for the third and fourth quarters. The company now expects GAAP EPS of $1.60 and adjusted EPS of $1.67 for the third quarter. The company claimed that it was in line with its earlier forecast. However, this fell short of analysts' estimates of $1.70 a share. Honeywell blamed the weak shipments to business and general aviation OEMs apart from the continued delays and completions in the defense & space segment in the domestic and global businesses. Lower volumes in productivity solutions also played its part in the soft guidance. Related Link: Cramer On Honeywell's Guidance Update: "This Does Not Make Sense" For the fourth quarter, the company expects EPS to be $1.74–$1.78 while guiding adjusted EPS to be $6.60–$6.64 for the full year. The company expects core organic sales to fall 1–2 percent for the full year. Analysts are looking for an EPS of $1.80 and $6.68 for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. Following the downbeat forecast, shares of other industrial conglomerates also started trading in volatile on Friday. At Last Check ... Honeywell was down 7.72 percent at $106.68. Other stocks in the sector: 3M Co (NYSE: MMM) was down 0.43 percent at $170.90. Carlisle Companies, Inc. (NYSE: CSL) was down 0.33 percent at $104.98.

Fraudster scams local out of thousands 11:21 a.m. EDT October 7, 2016 File photo (Photo: Journal & Courier) 24 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE CHILLICOTHE - A 65-year-old Clarksburg woman has reportedly been scammed out of at least $8,000. Chillicothe police responded Thursday morning to WalMart to talk with a woman who said she had been asked via Facebook to send $3,000 to a man in California. She told police she previously had sent $8,000 and was prepared to send the $3,000, but called police under the advisement of a WalMart employee who was concerned she was being scammed. Police talked with the woman’s son who said his mother had been scammed out of more than $15,000, but wouldn’t admit to it or listen to him due to her dementia. Reports of similar scams can be reported to the Ohio Attorney General’s Office by calling 800-282-0515.

Grocery giants bring click-and-buy service to Jackson area Posted by: Jack Weatherly in Economic Development, MBJ FEATURE, NEWS October 7, 2016 By JACK WEATHERLY Rival grocery giants Kroger and Walmart are rolling out online shopping programs in the Jackson area. The concept is designed to save time for shoppers just as the grocers battle to hold prices down for customers. For now, Kroger’s QuickList has next-day pickup, but soon it’ll be same-day, according to Marcus Hamilton, e-commerce field specialist. Hamilton declined to give specifics on how many orders have been filled since the service started in metro Jackson, but said “the numbers are good” and that both Jackson-area stores are meeting expectations. Bethany Haynes and her 3-month-old daughter, Liora, were leaving the Kroger in Jacksonian Square on Monday. She was asked if she knew about the new program. She said she did, but that hadn’t had time to sign up. “It sounds appealing, being a new mom,” said the Jackson resident. “I’ll have to be more strategic in my meal planning,” she said. Orders can be placed by going to kroger.com/onlineshopping and selecting a store and listing the items. The items are then brought by a store employee to be picked up at a designated spot on the parking lot. Kroger entered the Jackson market last week, beating Walmart by a few days. Krogers at 1070 Highway 51 in Madison, 6745 S. Siwell Road in Byram and in 3408 Pemberton Square Boulevard in Vicksburg offer the service, in addition to a store in Hernando and one in Southaven. The Cincinnati-based chain started offering the service in the Midwest last year. Reviews have been generally complimentary,, according to published accounts. Lisa Murtha, writing in Cincinnati Magazine, endorses the service, but offers a few helpful tips. She says if you wait till the day before “you risk all the time slots being full, or being left with a few random time choices that don’t work with your schedule.” Further, she writes, her experience has been that “as soon as your time is reserved, you have until midnight that same day to load items into your [virtual] cart. If you do not officially place your order by midnight, you lose both your cart contents and your time slot, and have to start over.” She said placing an order for her family of five takes her about 40 minutes, and, with a 10-15-minute wait at the pickup site, she cuts her shopping time in half. The first three QuickList orders are free. After that, it’s $4.95 per order. There is no minimum order, said Teresa Dickerson, public relations manager for Kroger’s Delta Division. Walmart, meantime, began its rollout in the state on Monday. And it is one-up on its rival in one regard. The service is free.But there is a $30 minimum purchase. Stores in Pearl at 5520 Highway 80 East, Clinton at 950 Highway 80 East and Flowood at 5341 Highway 25 now offer the service. Orders are placed at walmart.com/grocery or though a Walmart Grocery mobile app. Business Kroger Madison Mississippi NEWS 2016-10-07 Jack Weatherly tweet Tagged with: Business Kroger Madison Mississippi NEWS Previous: Aluminum startup finds going rough in Louisiana, as it did in Mississippi Next: BILL CRAWFORD: Congress should be ready to impeach whoever wins About Jack Weatherly More Stories Like This BILL CRAWFORD: Appointments will tell if Trump can deliver November 13, 2016 Health systems in New Orleans, McComb, announce partnership November 11, 2016 Stocks mixed as investors seek clarity on Trump policies November 11, 2016 Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 07, 2016 9:38am   Comments Share: Related WMT 3 Scenarios For Wal-Mart's Q3 Earnings Retail Earnings On The Docket: All The Important Dates You Need To Know Dividend Aristocrats In Focus Part 39: Wal-Mart (Seeking Alpha) While Wal-Mart Stores, Inc’s (NYSE: WMT) store and ecommerce enhancements are gaining momentum, the company would likely continue to generate flattish EPS growth due to elevated investments, Morgan Stanley’s Simeon Gutman said in a report He maintained an Equal-weight rating on the company, while reducing the price target from $76 to $74. At its Investment Community Meeting, Wal-Mart “delivered the most cohesive strategic message in years,” Gutman commented. Management seems to be initiating the right moves for the business and the company is evolving rapidly, “with better service, cleaner stores, higher in-stocks, deeper value, more unique items and a differentiated e-commerce platform in Jet.” Related Link: Wal-Mart Reaffirms 2017 Outlook, Sees Little Growth To 2018 Transformation Costlier, Taking Longer Than Expected While Wal-Mart’s top line growth is now the healthiest it has been since 2010, Gutman pointed out that “repositioning the largest retailer in a hyper competitive market is a massive undertaking” and that companies tend to “underestimate the cost of adapting.” He added that omni-channel transformations are typically costlier and take longer than most retailers anticipate. Take On Prospects EBIT and gross margins are expected to contract into F2018. The market seems to be underappreciating the difficult gross margin comps “WMT faces next year as it laps vendor negotiation benefits and modest deflation tailwinds,” the analyst commented. Although downside to Wal-Mart’s shares is limited by the company’s revenue momentum and “safe haven status” against a volatile consumer and retailer backdrop, expectations of flattish EPS makes the stock less compelling, Gutman said.

The incident started in a Walmart store just before noon Sept. 30 when the suspect, Michael Ortiz, 45, attempted to steal items but was caught. Ortiz ran out of the store and jumped into a car in the parking lot, which was occupied at the time by the vehicle’s owner and a friend. As Ortiz entered the vehicle, he demanded that the driver take him away from the store and threatened her by saying he “had something that would give her HIV,” according to the Swatara Township Police Department. The woman did as commanded and drove away from the store, but when she stopped at a red light, the passenger quickly exited the vehicle, pulled a gun on Ortiz and demanded he get out of the car. Ortiz exited the vehicle, but a struggle ensued between Ortiz and the woman as he tried to gain control of her gun. During this time, at least one shot was fired, but there were no reports of any injuries. Ortiz, however, fled the scene. The woman called 911 and returned to the Walmart to wait for police to arrive. A search for Ortiz commenced and included assistance from a police helicopter as well as tracking Bloodhounds, but he was not found. Using surveillance video from the Walmart store, Ortiz was positively identified and a warrant for his arrest was issued. He surrendered to authorities on Sunday. Ortiz was booked and charged with robbery of a vehicle, kidnapping and other offenses. He is being held at the Dauphin County Prison on a $100,000 bond. Authorities confirmed the woman was in legal possession of the gun and held a valid permit to carry a concealed weapon. Filed Under: Concealed Carry, Crime, Self Defense Walter Hargain Well, I mean, not shooting him in the face while in your car is pretty smart if he had the HIV. Especially if she had cloth interior. Also I highly recommend them fancy neoprene waterproof seat covers and Weathertech floormats for those of you that are willing to shoot someone in your car. Probably some Scotch Guard, too. And if it happens at a Wal-Mart parking lot, you can run in afterwards and get a few hearing aids. You’ll need them for a while. Mike in Illinois You made me think of Travolta in Pulp Fiction…. Walter Hargain Vincent: Oh man, I shot Marvin in the face. Jules: Why the fuck did you do that! Vincent: Well, I didn’t mean to do it, it was an accident! Jules: Oh man I’ve seen some crazy ass shit in my time… Vincent: Chill out, man. I told you it was an accident. You probably went over a bump or something. Jules: Hey, the car didn’t hit no motherfucking bump! USMC 8th and I KEEP YOUR DOORS LOCKED. Even when just sitting in your car. Mike in Illinois Situational awareness matters. So many people pay so little attention to who and what goes on around them, right down to the simple things they are oblivious – like locking your doors. Like the 21 foot rule. I get what others are saying about HIV blood all over the place, but if he jumped into the back seat, the person in the front seat could have unloaded the magazine right through the seat and it would have been over for that punk before he even got started trying to play with a infected needle. It is doubtful he had anything but an empty threat anyway, but regardless of that – when a gun is pulled it has to be used as more than a empty threat……because there is almost always that “struggle for the gun” when it is pulled and then used as just a threat in close quarters. Fair enough, hindsight is 20 20 but still, I know this much, a fella jumping in my car threatening things like death called HIV isn’t getting threats returned back, he is getting hot lead, and all of I can send his way as fast as I can send it. Mike in Illinois Authorities confirmed legal possession and permit to carry. OK, big deal. Someone please tell me what difference that makes. How would this situation be any different if she was a “prohibited person” and she had not held a permit? This was cut and dry crystal clear self defense, exercise of enumerated rights toward Declared self evident ends that are not within the purview of government. The ONLY difference that COULD be claimed is that the INNOCENT person attacked by a criminal was ‘fundamentally transformed” magically, into a criminal, and made into a criminal for NO MORE than the simple and straightforward exercise of right. Stop the madness, stop the intellectual dishonesty. Possession is above legal, it is lawful and lawful by RIGHT, not by government allowed permission BECAUSE government is not empowered to impose the abridgment called a permit in the first place, indeed it is specifically prohibited from claiming the power of permission for itself, usurping that Liberty from the Individual. It really is time to just admit that straight truth – and do the right thing. Accept it. MindFury SHe was in her car. why would she need a permit? Oh right state laws differ. cmi What good is a gun if you don’t use it?!?

Walmart and Amazon are vowing to remove this "tranny granny" outfit from their websites. It includes a dress, headscarf and padding for the breasts and rear-end. The costume sparked some outrage online, with many saying it's offensive to the transgender community. On Walmart and Amazon, the costume was reportedly listed by a third-party vendor named Rasta Imposta. According to the news site "LGBT Nation;" Walmart says the costume violates its terms of service for third-party retailers. It's still available from several other online retailers.

The world’s largest retailer completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it’s willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. “This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company,” CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company’s annual investment meeting. Wal-Mart also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. The company’s shares fell $2.12, or 3 percent, to $69.55 in afternoon trading. Still, the outlook wasn’t as bad as a year ago, when executives said earnings per share could fall 6 percent to 12 percent this year because of investments in higher salaries and e-commerce. That day, Wal-Mart shares plunged 10 percent. But Wal-Mart’s flurry of moves — online and in the stores — have been gaining traction, and its shares were up 17 percent this year ahead of the meeting. Like its direct store rivals, Wal-Mart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. Wal-Mart launched a number of changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. The company has 150 fresh food managers working to train sales associates. The company is also melding online services with its massive fleet of stores. It rolled out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it’s pushing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. Greg Foran, CEO and president of Wal-Mart’s U.S. namesake business, told analysts Thursday that by the end of the year, it will have grocery online pickup services at 600 U.S. stores. Wal-Mart had raised its annual profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth straight quarterly increase in revenue of stores opened at least a year.

And it saw fewer customers in the store for the first time in a year and a half. Wal-Mart's online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter -- up from 7 percent in the first quarter but still trailing the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago. Officials said Thursday they believe its global online sales will be up 20 percent to 30 percent in the second half of this year. 1 2 next  last »

Officials have proposed that the world's biggest retailer pay at least $600 million to resolve probes by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission into whether it bribed government officials in markets from Mexico to India and China, according to three people familiar with the matter. The retailer has rebuffed the government's request, two of them said. Such a settlement would rank among the largest in four decades under a U.S. law against bribing foreign officials to obtain business. VIDEOS TOP JOBS With the impasse, prosecutors have gone back to elicit more evidence from witnesses about alleged bribe-paying in Mexico, the people said. That will put additional pressure on the company to settle. Some of the people familiar with the matter said the U.S. could propose a penalty well above $600 million. The government has some challenges as well. Some of the behavior it's been investigating in Mexico, where the bulk of Wal-Mart's non-U.S. stores are located, may be too old to prosecute, people familiar with the matter have said. Officials are working to wrap up an agreement with Wal-Mart before a new administration takes over in January, the people said. That would add to the wave of enforcement actions already announced this year, including last week's agreement by Och-Ziff Capital Management LP to pay $415 million in penalties and fines to settle an U.S. investigation into bribe-paying across Africa. "As we've said from the beginning, we are cooperating fully with the government in this matter and have no further comment on that process," Wal-Mart spokesman Greg Hitt said in an email. He added that the company's compliance with anti-corruption laws is a priority and that the retailer was recognized this year by a New York Stock Exchange subsidiary for best governance program among large-cap companies. Spokesmen for the Justice Department and the SEC declined to comment. The Justice Department and the SEC have spent half a decade investigating allegations that Wal-Mart representatives paid government officials over the course of 10 years to fast-track store openings. The U.S.'s proposed penalty accounts for the profits Wal-Mart reaped from stores it was able to open quickly after allegedly paying officials to speed zoning and building permits, said the people, who asked to not be named because the matter is confidential. Calculating a fine based only on the amount of the alleged bribes, as the department has done in some cases, would yield a lower penalty, they said. Even as the sides are grappling over the size of a penalty, they are also discussing whether there will be any criminal charges against any part of the company, the people said. Wal-Mart has already spent $791 million on legal fees and an internal investigation into the alleged payments and to revamp its compliance systems around the world, it said. The retailer has had major turnover in management since the investigations began, including a new chief executive officer, chief financial officer and heads of U.S. and international operations. Wal-Mart has warned investors that it may face additional costs and a possible loss because of the investigation. It hasn't said what those costs may be. "Although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future," the company said in a regulatory filing in March. While settlement of $600 million or more would be substantial for a company that has gained attention and a competitive edge for its focus on counting pennies to hold down costs, it's modest relative to the company's recent global results. The company posted more than $14 billion in profits last year on $482 billion in sales. Under Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon, who took over in 2014, most of the company's focus has been on improving its U.S. stores and online operations, rather than faster international expansion. Those efforts are starting to pay off, and the company's shares have gained 17 percent this year. The Justice Department is wrapping up several of the marquee investigations started under President Barack Obama, including into financial-crisis-era behavior and benchmark manipulation. Several European banks, including Deutsche Bank AG, are negotiating settlements over their mortgage practices that officials are trying to close in the administration's final months, people familiar with the situation have said. The Wal-Mart settlement, as described, would rank among the highest levied under 1977's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bans companies from bribing officials to win business overseas. Earlier this year, VimpelCom Ltd. paid $795 million to settle U.S. and Dutch claims that it bribed officials in Uzbekistan to win business. Siemens AG paid a record $800 million in a combined SEC-Justice Department penalty in 2008. » Next page...

The world’s largest retailer also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. Walmart completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it’s willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. “This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company,” CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company’s annual investment meeting. Like its direct store rivals, Walmart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com, whose Prime shopping program is swiftly converting members into loyal shoppers. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. But Walmart has seen its investments online and in the stores pay off — and it’s starting to gain ground over some of the competitors. It has launched a flurry of changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. The company has 150 fresh food managers working to train store sales associates. Walmart is also melding online services with its massive fleet of stores. It rolled out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it’s pushing ahead with online grocery and pickup services. Greg Foran, CEO and president of Walmart’s U.S. namesake business, told analysts Thursday that by the end of the year it will have grocery online pickup services at 600 U.S. stores. The company is in the second year of its $2.7 billion investment in its workers that involves higher pay and more training. It says that such investments as well as the other moves are already helping to improve customer service in the stores. McMillon reiterated to analysts Thursday that he believes the Jet.com acquisition will help it attract higher-income and younger customers. The company plans to incorporate some of Jet.com’s technology that lowers prices in real time. Walmart said Thursday it would spend $11 billion on capital expenditures this year, and the same for the following fiscal year. In the fiscal year ended in January, the company spent $11.5 billion on capital expenditures. But Walmart said it will be investing more of that money in e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company also said that it plans to open 130 U.S. stores this year, down from 230 in its last fiscal year. Copyright 2016 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The state gave its closing argument first. DeProw gave the jury five things to remember. He said the essence of the case was in the black bag, white rag, NEA Baptist video, Korre Phillips, and the confession video. DeProw told the jury this is all the critical evidence, and while he knows the defense is throwing out suggestions and ideas for what could have happened, there is no evidence of those theories. He used Tarver’s quotes from the confession video throughout his closing. The state also reverted back to the evidence of Tarver’s DNA found on the white rag and the rope with red fibers behind Tarver’s home matching the rope inside the black bag and found on Bridger road. DeProw encouraged the jury to watch the confession video again and make a determination if Tarver’s testimony in court makes sense. The defense then had an opportunity to speak to the jury. Miller started his closing with the statement, “Please don’t hurt my wife.” Miller said that’s what Tarver told police and where his state of mind was when he was arrested. Miller called this a bizarre case. He also showed several receipts showing the Tarver’s had bought things for a birthday party the weekend of the murder. The defense questioned how Tarver could have possibly killed Counce and acted calm throughout the weekend. Miller told the jury it’s their job to decide if witnesses are credible. He spent the majority of his close recounting past testimony from the trial. He focused on Korre Phillips and said he had a strange reaction to law enforcement. Miller said Phillips is not telling the truth. He also spoke about the lack of physical evidence and the possibility of the DNA evidence being contaminated. Miller finished by telling the jury this is a decision they can’t take back. Prosecuting Attorney Scott Ellington then gave the final close for the state. The state is allowed the last word because they have the burden of proof. Ellington said the confession the jury sees from Tarver is not fake. He said there is no way Roland could have given Tarver so many details in a short amount of time. The state also reverted back to previous trial hearings months ago. Ellington said Tarver never mentioned in those hearings that he was threatened or influenced to confess. Ellington said Tarver’s family said this action would be out of character and wearing jeans and a hoodie would be out of character. The state said yes that would be out of character, but Tarver said in his confession he was dressed in a costume and acting as a certain character. Ellington said the most frightening thing to him is while the defense is trying to point the finger at Phillips, it’s clear Tarver would have gotten away with this had he not asked Phillips for a ride that day. That ended closing statements. The jury was then taken out of the courtroom to deliberate.  The defense began its portion of the trial on Wednesday. The state rested its case after recalling Korre Phillips to the stand to show video of him leaving the Hays grocery store at 12:56 p.m. The video was used to demonstrate Phillips couldn’t have left Hays and made it to NEA Baptist by 1 p.m. on July 3, 2015. The defense crossed by making it clear you cannot see what car Phillips was driving in the video. Before calling any witnesses, Miller moved for a directed verdict on all charges and to suppress evidence from the search warrant. Miller argued there was lack of evidence to support the charges, and he said the search warrant was illegal. All motions were denied by Judge Cindy Thyer except for one. Judge Thyer did give a directed verdict for the aggravated robbery charge. She said, by definition and based on evidence presented, Tarver did not commit aggravated robbery. That still leaves six charges for the jury to decide on. The defense’s first witness was Dennis Tarver. He is the father of Richard Jordon Tarver. Dennis described his son’s upbringing and education background. Tarver received a GED and has worked a couple of full time jobs. Dennis did say his son lacks motivation and work ethic. Tarver’s father said he saw his son on Thursday, July 1. Dennis went out of town over the weekend and didn’t see him again until Monday, July 6, 2015. Dennis told the defense Tarver seemed normal when he saw him on Monday. They did discuss Counce’s disappearance and read about it daily. In the state’s cross examination, Dennis told DeProw Tarver has no mental, emotional, or physical disabilities. Dennis said Tarver was needed at home to help his wife with their two children. Dennis also said he and his wife give Tarver money on a regular basis. Jamie Platts, Tarver’s mother-in-law, was the next witness. She explained her daughter Samantha, Tarver’s wife, has medical issues. Samantha is unable to work so Tarver must be home to help her. Platts described Tarver as the best son-in-law she could ask for her daughter. Platts stated in her testimony that she saw Tarver on July 3, 2015, around 1 p.m. Platts said she was dropping the Tarver’s eldest daughter off at their home in Bay. The defense submitted a phone record as evidence that Platts called her daughter at 12:38 p.m. on July 3. She said she arrived at their home 10 to 15 minutes later. That is when she saw Tarver walking outside his home. Platts said she saw Tarver again on Sunday, July 5, at her granddaughter’s birthday party, and Tarver acted normal. DeProw then asked Platts several questions including what she thought about Tarver’s DNA being found on a wash cloth inside Counce’s home. Platts’ answer was Tarver sweats a lot and has a lot of wash clothes around. The state also asked how she felt about Tarver’s confession. Platts said Tarver confessed because he was scared for this wife. When asked if she saw or heard police threaten her daughter, she said no. However, when Miller asked Platts if she heard police threaten to arrest Samantha, Platts said yes.  After a lunch recess, Samantha Tarver, Richard Tarver's wife, took the stand to testify.  She explained she had many health issues and spent most of her time in bed.  She said because of these health issues, she was unable to hold a job.  On July 2, Samantha said her and Richard's about 7-month-old child kept them up throughout the night.  She said she and Richard slept in until about 1 p.m. July 3.  Her explanation for waking up at that time was her mother called to drop off their other daughter.  Samantha told the jury Richard then went outside to mow the lawn to prepare for their daughter's birthday party on Sunday.  She said her husband did sweat a lot and many times she would take a washrag outside to him. She did say Richard would often leave those washrags outside or under their carport.  The only people Samantha Tarver said who visited them that day was her mother.  She said Korre Phillips never came over like he said he did and like Tarver said in his confession video. On July 17, Samantha said she and Richard were in the back sleeping when they heard a banging at their front door.  She said she answered the door to guns pointed in her face.  She explained she had her baby in her hands and got down on the ground to protect her.  Samantha said she heard Richard ask police officers to not harm her or their baby.  She said then she was taken outside, placed in handcuffs, and threatened to be taken to jail. When she found out why police were there, she said she told them what they did on July 3.  She described the officers as rude and that they watched her change clothes when she went back inside.  Samantha Tarver also said that police told her they could come back for her at any time. During cross-examination, she told the jury that she knew her husband had a gun but thought he got rid of it.  She explained she was on 4 different types of medication at the time and spent a lot of time in bed.  When asked about the rain that day, she said their yard was dry enough to mow.  She said she thought Richard confessed to the crime to protect her.  After Samantha Tarver left the stand, her husband and the man accused of the murder, Richard Tarver testified.  While on the stand, Tarver repeated what his wife said about July 2 and 3.  He said their baby was teething and kept them up late, so they slept in until about 1 p.m. on Friday.  He said he attempted to mow the yard but the ground was still too wet.  Instead, he said he just picked up sticks around the yard.  Tarver said he and his family did go shopping that day but used money from his parents and daughter and some that he saved up.  He said he never saw Korre Phillps that day, did not take money from Lavinda Counce, nor did he go to the Hilltop area.  On the night he was arrested, Tarver repeated again what his wife said.  He said they heard banging on the door after waking up, his wife answered, and then went to the ground.  He explained that he said "I know, I know" because he knew to get on the ground.  Tarver said from where he was standing behind his wife, it looked like she had been pushed out of the way.  He said Captain Justin Rolland with the Craighead County Sheriff's Department took him outside and they eventually ended up in a white SUV together.  While in the vehicle, Tarver said Rolland read him his rights and also threatened him.  He said he was told his baby would be taken by DHS and his wife would go to jail.  Also while in the vehicle, Tarver said Rolland gave him information about the case so he could repeat it during a confession.  He said his biggest concern was his family.  During the interview at the Craighead County Sheriff's Department, Tarver said he lied about killing Counce.  He said Rolland wanted to hear a specific thing, so he said it.  He explained Rolland had the power to do what he wanted and did not want his wife separated from his baby. When asked about his gun, Tarver said he knew the serial number was defaced.  Tarver said he tried to sell it but nobody was interested because of the serial number.  He said Korre Phillips did look at the gun but did not buy it.  Tarver said he considered Rolland a "monster" for coming into his home and accusing him of the murder.  He said during the interview, he thought Rolland was trying to implicate his wife in the crime. During cross-examination, the prosecution discussed Tarver's testimony from a pre-trial. The prosecution showed Tarver that he said he got his information about the case from other news sources.  Tarver said he did not mention Korre Phillips at that time because his wife could still be arrested. He said again that many of the things he said during his confession were not true and that he made up most of it.  Tarver said he knew about Counce's cane from Phillips' girlfriend. Tarver added he came up with finding the $50 bill in Counce's purse.  He also said the comment about wanting to know what it was like to kill a person was something that just came out during the confession. Tarver said the comment about shooting Counce in the head was just something he had seen in movies.  He explained the reason for his comments were to protect his family and that he was not thinking about the Counce family at that time.  Some of the things he said Rolland told him about the case included what was in Counce's purse in her trunk, where Phillips was on July 3, and about the surveillance footage from NEA Baptist Hospital. The defense asked a few more questions after the prosecution.  During that questioning, Tarver said his wife went to NEA Baptist for treatment.  He said the route he told police in his confession was the same route they took to get to the hospital.  The defense rested and court is scheduled to meet again Thursday morning with motions at 9 and the jury at 9:30. The state called two more witnesses Tuesday morning. Lieutenant Aaron Davis, Craighead County Sheriff’s Department, participated in serving the search warrant at Tarver’s home. He recounted Tarver’s confession in court. Davis first described entering Tarver’s home. Tarver was on the ground, and Davis said Tarver’s wife had no reaction or expression on her face. After Tarver was taken into custody, Davis drove Tarver to the Craighead County Sheriff’s Department with Captain Justin Roland. Davis said Tarver was silent the entire ride. There was no discussion with him until they got to the interview room at the sheriff’s department. After Tarver was read his rights, Davis said he answered many of his and Roland’s questions. Tarver told Davis his selection of Counce was random, and he didn’t know much about her. Davis said Tarver’s plan was to leave Counce’s car at NEA Baptist and walk home to Bay. He said he chose NEA Baptist because he wanted to leave the car in an obvious place. Tarver had also considered leaving it at the mall or Walmart, according to Davis. In the interview, Tarver said he simply gave Counce commands and she did as he said. Tarver said at one point Counce did try to walk away and Tarver told her to stop. When asked why he didn’t kill her in her home, Davis said Tarver claimed he took Counce to the cornfield because he never shot the gun before and was worried about the noise it would make. Davis also asked him about the black bag. Tarver told Davis he didn’t remember having the bag but if he did it was a part of his costume as a survivor in the apocalypse. The lieutenant said Tarver even demonstrated how he killed Counce. According to the testimony, Tarver helped Counce out of the trunk of her car and told her to walk toward the field. She followed his order and he shot her in the head. Davis said Tarver demonstrated the angle of the shot on Roland by making a gun with his hand. Davis said Tarver told Roland he was much taller than Counce so Roland bent down so Tarver could properly demonstrate. During the interview, Davis said Tarver had a lack of emotion, was expressionless, and didn’t ask about where his wife and child were. As far as why he killed Counce, Davis said Tarver never gave an answer. Davis said Tarver never said he was sorry and when asked how he felt after killing Counce, Tarver said he felt better. The defense cross-examined Davis by asking him about his contact with Korre Phillips. Miller questioned testimony Phillips gave to Davis regarding the last time he had talked to Tarver and asked if the Phillips family had time to discuss the sheriff’s department’s interest in this case before giving a formal statement. Davis said he didn’t know. Miller then reviewed the previous statements Davis made in his testimony including Tarver saying he was going to walk back to Bay after leaving Counce’s car at NEA Baptist. Miller said Tarver is not in great shape and doesn’t walk often. Korre Phillips was the other witness called to the stand Tuesday morning. He recounted what he did on July 3. Phillips told the state he went and bought fireworks then went to Hays to buy groceries for a cookout. When at Hays, Phillips said he received a call that Tarver was at his home. Phillips said Tarver told him he had been at NEA Baptist visiting a friend and needed a ride home. Phillips said he had nothing to do with Counce’s murder and knew nothing about it when he gave Tarver a ride to Bay. In the cross-examination, Miller asked Phillips if someone else could have used his debit card at Hays to look like he was there. Phillips said no. Miller asked Phillips about knowing Tarver’s wife and possibly being jealous of their relationship along with questioning his truthfulness about statements made about Tarver. Phillips was asked to identify the difference in tools that belonged to Tarver with general tools, and Phillips said he couldn’t tell a difference. The state then made it clear Tarver told the investigators Phillips was not involved in the Counce murder nor did Phillips know about it when he drove Tarver home.  Captain Justin Rolland took the stand after a lunch recess.  He said he assisted in the case and first started working it on July 3.  Rolland said Sheriff Marty Boyd called him to inform him of a possible missing person in Bay.  He hoped the case would just be a missing person but that changed on July 12.  That was the day Counce's body was found.  With a confirmed homicide, Rolland explained that was also the day their investigation changed. Rolland was another investigator who talked to the Phillips family on Bridger Road.  On July 17, Rolland said Korre Phillips admitted to giving Tarver a ride and asked him to come to the sheriff's department.  Based on information given by Korre Phillips, Rolland said they received a search warrant.  He explained to the jury that they were in a hurry because they did not want Phillips to tell Tarver what he told investigators.  Rolland said they planned to knock on Tarver's door to get consent to search the home.  After they knocked and no one answered the door, Rolland said they attempted to force entry into the home.  He said Tarver then opened the door and asked them not to harm his wife or child.  Rolland said Tarver complied with orders and got on the ground while he held him at gunpoint.  After a few minutes of other officers clearing the home, Rolland said he cuffed Tarver and brought him outside to a vehicle.  Rolland said he read Tarver his rights inside the vehicle.  He said at first, Tarver denied any involvement with the incident but later changed his statement to his wife did not have any involvement.  Rolland said when he asked Tarver what happened,  he said he took her from the home and dropped her off in the cornfield.  He explained that he, Tarver and Davis then went to the sheriff's department for further questions.  When asked about Tarver's demeanor in the vehicle, Rolland said he was calm and looked like the world had been lifted from his shoulders.  The prosecution then showed a video involving Rolland, Tarver, and Davis where Tarver confessed to killing Counce.  In the video, Tarver explained that he went to Counce's home, knocked on the door, and just walked in.   He told investigators in the video that he gave Counce directions, which she followed.  Tarver also said in the video that he put Counce in the trunk of her car and drove to a cornfield.  He said in the video that he got her out, pointed at the corn, and shot Counce as she was walking. When investigators asked him in the video why he did it, Tarver replied by saying he wanted to know what it was like to kill a human.  In the video, Tarver said he watched The Walking Dead and thought an elderly person was as close as he was going to get to a zombie. When investigators asked him about the black bag in the video, Tarver said it was an accessory to his survivor outfit.  Tarver also told investigators in the video that robbery was not his motivation and the money he took was a bonus.  Tarver explained he was worried about the sound of the gun because he had never fired a gun before.  He also mentioned that he had gone to a doctor and received depression pill a few weeks before the interview. Tarver said he felt better after the shooting because he had gotten it out of his system.  After the first video, the prosecution showed a second video that was taken July 17.  In that video, Rolland showed Tarver photos of the black bag and it's contents.  Tarver claimed a few of the items but not all of them.  After the second video, Rolland said Tarver told him that he used some of the money he took from Counce at Walmart for items to use during his daughter's birthday party.  During cross-examination, the defense asked again what Tarver's first words were to Rolland.  The defense continued to talk about Korre Phillips and how he denied being the person in surveillance video from Hay's earlier in court.  Rolland said he thought Phillips was mistaken because they confirmed that Phillips was in Hay's during their investigation. The defense then brought up a comment that Phillips made while at the sheriff's department.  They said he denied making a comment about one of the investigator's shot glasses in his office that had a zombie on it.  Rolland did recall that comment being discussed on July 17.  The defense then had Rolland reiterate that they received a search warrant for Tarver's home based off of information given by Phillips. When asked about the conversation between Tarver and Rolland in the vehicle outside of Tarver's home, Rolland said there were no other witnesses to hear Tarver's verbal acknowledgments to his rights.  Rolland told the defense that he did not threaten Tarver's family at all.  He explained that he reassured Tarver that his family was at home in the second video because of the comment Tarver made when they first made entry into his home.  Rolland said he did not further investigate the Phillips family or their friend James Henry after Tarver's arrest.  Before Rolland left the stand, the prosecution asked a few more questions.  Rolland said he did state again in the first video to Tarver that he had read him his rights before they arrived at the sheriff's department.  He also confirmed that Tarver corroborated everything Korre Phillips told them when they interviewed him earlier that day.  The trial is scheduled to resume Wednesday morning at 9, Week two of the Lavinda Counce murder trial continued Monday. Two more witnesses took the stand Monday morning. Dr. Frank Perettie, medical examiner for the Arkansas State Crime Lab, performed the autopsy on Counce’s body. He described photos of Counce’s remains including the gunshot wound to her head and the decomposition of the body. Dr. Perettie had to explain where certain body parts were because it was difficult to distinguish some parts due to maggots eating away at her body along with the decomposition of skin. With the gunshot wound, Dr. Perettie said there was evidence of a blunt force head injury to the face. He said it appears she may have been struck in the face with an unknown object. Detective Ron Richardson, Craighead County Sheriff’s Department, was recalled to the stand. The state reviewed more evidence with Richardson including rope found off Bridger Road in Jonesboro similar to rope also found in a burn barrel at Tarver’s home. Richardson also described the night they searched Tarver’s home and arrested him. Richardson said no law enforcement member ever made threats to Tarver’s wife or child and when Tarver was asked if he knew why they were there he said “I know.” The night of the search, Tarver confessed to the crime as well as telling Richardson where to find a gun. The gun recovered in Tarver’s attic was presented in court to the jury. Its serial number was filed off. Miller, Tarver’s attorney, then cross examined Richardson. Miller had Richardson recount the investigation and explain the fact the court knows the last time Counce was heard from and when her car was found, but it doesn’t know when exactly Counce was killed. The defense asked Richardson if they’d heard Tarver’s name until members of the Phillips family mentioned it. Richardson said no. Miller said Tarver’s name was never mentioned in the investigation until people who live behind NEA Baptist, live off of Bridger Road, and know the Counce family mentioned it. Miller made a mention of Korre Phillips, the man who said he drove Tarver home to Bay the day Counce went missing, also being obsessed with The Walking Dead but no further investigation was made into that family. Beyond the interviews with Tarver and the Phillips family, Miller discussed the lack of physical evidence with Richardson. Miller confirmed with Richardson that Tarver’s fingerprints were not found anywhere, and the only DNA evidence that links Tarver to the crime is the wash cloth inside the black bag found at Counce’s home. There was also a footprint found at the scene that Richardson confirmed did not match Tarver’s shoe. Richardson said there was not enough bullet fragments recovered to know if the bullet used to kill Counce came from Tarver’s gun. The state then asked Richardson a few more questions. DeProw focused on the fact that Richardson never had any suspicion of the Phillips in relation to this crime. Richardson said no one in the Phillips family ever confessed to the crime, but Tarver did confess to the crime on two separate occasions. It was also noted by the state that pet hair was found on the black bag in Counce’s home. Counce had no pets, but Tarver did have pets in his home. Miller countered that statement by making Richardson aware that more than 50% of households in the United States have pets.  The defense ended by asking Richardson if Tarver had any way of knowing how his wife and children were when he confessed. Richardson said no he would not have known that they weren’t in custody.  After the lunch recess, more employees with the Arkansas State Crime Lab took the stand. Bobby Humphries examined shoes and an impression of a shoe print for the case.  He said during his examination, he was unable to match the 3 pairs with the impression.  Another employee analyzed fingerprints in the case.  She said she analyzed 14 items but only found partial prints on a few items.  She explained that a person can touch something and not leave a fingerprint. At the end of her examination, she could not include or exclude anyone.  She also said she never got to the point in her testing to compare Tarver's prints to the partials she found.  A third employee with the lab was a firearms and tool mark examiner who tested a gun from Tarver's home. She said the serial number on the gun was defaced but she was able to recover it.  She tested small damaged copper jacket fragments with a bullet fired from the gun.  The examiner told the jury that she was unable to rule in or out the gun because the jackets had similar class characteristics.  During cross-examination, she said the firearm that fired the fragments was a common gun but she could not give the caliber of the fragments. After the crime lab employees finished testifying, a man by the name of James Henry took the stand.  Henry lived with James Phillips on Bridger Road in July 2015. He said on July 3 a man came to the door asking for Phillips and Phillips' son. Henry said he made a phone call to the son to see if the man could stay in the house. After given approval, he said he let the man in but the man did not talk to him.  When the son got home, he said the son took the man home.  Henry said later, the investigators came by the home but did not inform them about the man.  He said he did not remember until around July 17.  The defense cross-examined Henry and asked about how much he knew about Counce.  He said he found out about her a day or two after July 4 from the news.  Henry also mentioned he, Phillips' son and Phillips were obsessed with the show The Walking Dead. A Hay's Grocery Store manager took the stand after Henry.  He explained that he supplied surveillance footage to the Craighead County Sheriff's Department from the store at their request. The manager said there was a 15 minute difference on the time stamp in the video.  He said this has been a problem for a while that they just recently fixed.  The prosecution then called James Phillips to the stand.  Phillips explained he lived in a trailer house on Bridger Road with his son, grandson, and friend James Henry.  He said he has known Tarver since 1997 or 1998.  Phillips said Tarver was one of his son's first friends when they moved to Bay.  Phillips stressed that Tarver was like an adopted son to him. He said on July 3, he was out with his son and grandson getting groceries and fireworks.  He said he knew his son received a phone call and later found out Tarver was looking for a ride home.  Phillips identified Tarver in the courtroom and from a photo.  He said Tarver looked different in the photo but it was the same person. Phillips continued to say investigators visited him on July 15 asking about any people that may have come by days before.  He said at the time he did not think to mention Tarver because he did not see it as suspicious.  Phillips said Tarver would come to his home all the time when he was younger and came over a lot when his wife got sick. When cross-examined, Phillips told the jury that he knew Counce.  He said he rented a home from Counce, who he thought highly of. He first found out about Counce's disappearance on July 4 by watching the news.  The defense told Phillips that in Richardson's visit to his home, he told the investigator that he lived alone.  Phillips said that piece of information was misconstrued and that he was not trying to hide the fact that he lived with other people. In all, Phillips said he talked with investigators on 3 different days.  He thought it was odd that Tarver may have walked from the hospital to his home.  He said that seemed out of character and even when he was younger, Tarver liked to drive.  Before he left the stand, Phillips said neither he nor his son had anything to do with Counce's disappearance and that he was not trying to cover for Tarver.  The last witness of the day was Keith Bowers, a deputy with the CCSD.  In July 2015, Bowers was a transport officer who transported evidence from the case.  He said he did not pack the items or touch them when they were in his vehicle.  Bowers said he transported them to the state crime lab and came back to Jonesboro.  Court is scheduled to resume Tuesday morning at 9.  Witness testimony continued Friday in the Counce murder trial.  Etter's testimony continued from Thursday afternoon. He briefly spoke about video surveillance he received from NEA Baptist and Hay's Supermarket.  The supermarket video was to show Korre Phillips', the man who said he gave Tarver a ride home to Bay on July 3, location at a certain time of a day.  Etter was also questioned about another possible suspect named Trevor Polston but explained he was released from consideration after questioning.  Miller crossed Etter by asking about phone records and Polston's whereabouts on July 3. Etter said he had no access to phone records and nothing to do with that paperwork.  Becky Wrinkles was called to the stand after Etter. Wrinkles said she lives off of Bridger Road and saw a man walking along Bridger Road on July 3 between 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 p.m. Wrinkles told DeProw she found it odd someone was walking along that road because in her 6 years of living in the area she rarely sees people walking.  She said she remembered a white man walking down the road in blue jeans.  Wrinkles told DeProw once she saw Tarver's mugshot on Region 8 News she knew that was the man she saw walking down the road.  Miller crossed by asking Wrinkles if she remembered what the man she saw was wearing. Wrinkles said he was wearing blue jeans, a black t-shirt, and a hat.  Detective Ron Richardson, a criminal investigator for the Craighead County Sheriff's Department, was the next witness called.  With 24 years of experience in law enforcement, he described to the prosecutor all the evidence he collected during the Counce murder investigation.  He also told the jury what he did to the evidence to process it for further information or leads including sending some of it to the Arkansas State Crime Lab.  Richardson showed the courtroom every piece of evidence including the black bag found at Counce's home and all that was inside it.  He also discussed his process of dusting for finger prints around Counce's home and in her vehicle.  Richardson told DeProw it is difficult to get fingerprints from a door knob because the dust they use doesn't stick to it at times.  Evidence including Counce's purse, wallet, cell phone, cell phone battery, and rope found on Bridger Road were presented.  Richardson described Counce's wallet and said there was a piece of black tape on the wallet.  When the tape was removed, Richardson said there was no evidence of the wallet being damaged or needing tape.  Richardson did see something red on the tape. He told DeProw he sent it to the state crime lab because he wasn't sure if it were blood or lipstick.  Also found in Counce's car was a pair of gloves. Photos of Counce's body were also shown during Richardson's testimony.  As part of the investigation, Richardson joined other detectives and deputies in knocking on doors around Bridger Road.  Richardson said he knocked on many doors in a trailer park off Bridger Road and talked to many residents.  The only residence that had a connection to Counce was a trailer owned by James Phillips. Richardson said Phillips asked him if they were investigating the Counce murder.  When Richardson said yes, Phillips told him he knew Counce and used to rent a home from her, but Phillips said he didn't remember anything about July 3 or seeing anyone walking down the road.  Because of the connection, Richardson said he revisited the trailer multiple times. After several conversations, Richardson finally learned Phillips' son Korre also lived there in the trailer.  Richardson said he later found out from those who lived at the trailer that Tarver had came by on July 3 and asked Korre to give him a ride back to Bay.  The detective said Tarver and Korre knew each other, and the surveillance video from Hay's showed Korre was where he said he was at a certain time of day on July 3.  Richardson did not say what time of day that was or go into detail about the video of Korre.  After receiving information from Korre, Richardson said a search warrant for Tarver's home was issued.  When the trial resumed after a lunch recess, employees of the Arkansas State Crime Lab took the stand.  The first witness was Chantelle Taylor who works with trace evidence at the lab which includes items like hair and fiber.  Taylor explained her qualifications and what she does during testing.  She said she tested hair, rope, and plastic wrap from the case.  During her testing, Taylor said the hair was from an animal.  The rope she received was from the bag found in Counce's home, a sample taken from Tarver's home and pieces found at Bridger Road.  She said her testing showed rope from the bag and from Tarver's home matched. Taylor said her results also showed that more rope from the bag and from Bridger Road had similar properties but could not say for sure if it came from the same piece of rope. She also had a piece of plastic wrap and a partial used box of plastic wrap to test.  Taylor told the jury that she could not match up the piece to the box but that it was similar. During cross-examination, Taylor said both the rope and plastic wrap were not uncommon.  She said the only uncommon thing about the rope was that it was deconstructed.  Taylor also said she could not say which animal the hair she tested came from.  The next witness to take the stand was Mandi Wertenberger who deals with physical evidence. She also explained her qualifications and process when she tested items.  Wertenberger said when testing, she looks for things like blood or semen that could give DNA evidence.  She said she tested the bag and its contents found at Counce's home but did not find blood on anything.  When cross-examined, she said she did find possible blood on shoes from Tarver's home. She explained that further testing showed that it was not blood but something else.  The last witness of the day was Mary Simonson, a DNA examiner. She said she tested swabs and tape lifts from Wertenberger for possible DNA. Out of the many items in the bag, she only found Tarver's DNA in a sample from the washcloth.  She said she did find an unknown female's DNA on items that included the billy club wrapped in plastic wrap and the black bag's zipper and pulls. Simonson explained that that DNA was not from Counce or Tarver's wife. When the defense cross-examined Simonson, they asked about each item again.  She told the jury that the only item in the bag with his DNA was the washcloth.  When asked about possible cross contamination during testing, Simonson explained that did not happen because their control samples passed each time. When the prosecution asked more questions, they asked her about the other items.  Simonson said other items in the bag like a screwdriver or butcher knife did not hold DNA well because it has a smooth surface. The trial took a recess after Simonson's testimony and will resume Monday at 9 a.m. The state and defense gave opening statements Thursday morning.  The jury took their seats as family and friends of Lavinda Counce filled up two rows in the courtroom behind the state.  Several were also in the courtroom behind Tarver's bench.  Grant DeProw, deputy prosecutor, gave the state's opening statements. He started by showing the jury a picture of the 90-year-old.  He explained Counce's daily routine and what she was doing on July 3, 2015.  DeProw said 11:11 a.m. was the last time anyone heard from Counce on July 3. She spent the day going to the salon and cleaning her home.  The Counce family planned to get together Saturday, July 4, 2015.  He also explained what Tarver was doing that day according to his interview with law enforcement.  DeProw said Tarver had binge watched "The Walking Dead" and had an obsession with zombies, the apocalypse, and how he wanted to know what it was like to kill someone.  Since there were no zombies, DeProw said Tarver picked a 90-year-old woman to kill.  DeProw explained to the jury they would hear from several witnesses that put Tarver near NEA Baptist Memorial Hospital on July 3, which is where Counce's car was found.  One witness the jury will hear from knows Tarver and lives on Bridger Road behind NEA Baptist. DeProw said that witness will explain how Tarver knocked on their door that day asking for a ride back to Bay.  DeProw also went into detail about July 12, 2015, when Counce was found. A man, on his first day of searching, found Counce's body in a cornfield. Counce's was found with a gunshot wound to the head.  Police were called and that's when the missing person's case turned into a murder investigation.  The state said the Craighead County Sheriff's Office investigation took them to Bridger Road where they talked to witnesses who said they saw Tarver and gave him a ride back to Bay.  DeProw also described the sheriff's department first interaction with Tarver. The state told the jury they will watch a video where Tarver confesses to police.  The prosecutor said the jury will see Tarver in the video describe exactly what he did, how he killed Counce, and told police he had a .38-caliber gun in his attic.  DeProw said Tarver showed no remorse or guilt. He then explained what physical evidence the state will present.  That evidence includes the duffel bag found inside Counce's home that contains a wash cloth with Tarver's DNA.  Randel Miller, Tarver's defense attorney, gave his opening statement. "Please don't hurt my wife," is how Miller began.  He said that is why Tarver confessed. Tarver had watched the news and kept up with Counce case through the media. Miller said because of threats law enforcement made to his wife and children he felt he had to say whatever they wanted him to say.  Tarver knew what to say to police because he watched Counce's case unfold in the media. According to Miller, Tarver is gullible and easily manipulated, which is why police got him to confess.  Miller told the jury they will hear testimony from Tarver's mother-in-law and wife that explains Tarver was home at the time Counce's car was left at NEA Baptist.  The lack of physical evidence is something Miller also focused on. He explained there is unidentified DNA of a female and possibly another male on the duffel bag.  There is no DNA evidence of Tarver inside Counce's car. Tarver's DNA can only be found on the wash cloth inside the duffel bag. Miller also said the gun police found in Tarver's home does not match the bullet used to kill Counce.  He asked the jury to remember they are here to judge facts and the credibility of witnesses.  One witness in particular Miller mentioned was the witness that claims he saw Tarver on July 3, on Bridger Road and gave him a ride back to Bay.  Miller said that witness knew Counce and told the jury they should look for inconsistencies during this entire trial.  The state called its first witness after Miller's opening statement. Prosecuting Attorney Scott Ellington called Patsy Scott to the stand.  Scott is Counce's eldest daughter. Scott described her mother's appearance, stature, past health conditions, and lifestyle.  Scott was in tears as she described the day her mother went missing. Scott had dinner with her mother Thursday night. That was the last time she saw or spoke to her.  In her testimony, Scott said she called her mother twice Friday and when she realized at 9:30 p.m. she hadn't heard from her, she knew something was wrong.  Scott and her husband drove from Jonesboro to Counce's home in Bay to find her car gone, an unmade bed, an unrecognizable duffel bag, and no sign of Counce.  She said she felt panic when she picked up the duffel bag and saw a crowbar and other tools inside. Scott called police shortly after that.  Ellington showed the jury 15 photos of the inside and outside of Counce's home.  Scott told Ellington there was money and jewelry missing from Counce's dresser drawer.  Miller did cross-examine Scott and asked her if the money usually in Counce's drawer could have been spent already. Scott said yes it was possible.  Scott was then released from the witness stand.  After a lunch recess, the prosecution called Earnestine Ladd to the stand.  Ladd said she was one of Counce's best friends and called her the day she disappeared.  She said everything seemed to be normal while they were talking.  About an hour after the first call, she said she called again but there was no answer.  After Ladd, Sergeant Keith Milan with the Bay Police Department took the stand.  Milan explained that in July 2015 he was living in a home across the street from where Counce lived.  He said he received a call July 3, 2015 at around 10:10 p.m. of a missing person.  Milan said he walked across the street to talk to the family and was told her car was not there.  He requested a BOLO for Counce's vehicle.  Milan told the court he contacted local hospitals to be on the lookout and called the chief to figure out how to send a Silver Alert.  Milan said the family took him to a bag in the house that they did not claim.  He noticed a knife, crowbar, and other items in the bag.  Milan said he asked the family to leave because the room was a crime scene.  While he was looking around the house, he said he did not see any signs of a struggle or any signs of forced entry.  Milan explained he also helped in the search for Counce's body, which took up most of his day.  When the county went to search Tarver's home, Milan said he was instructed by his chief to assist.  He said they had to force an entry into Tarver's home but did not hear any threats made to anyone.  During cross-examination by the defense, Milan said he did not ask the family if anyone touched the bag they took him to.  He said his biggest concern was finding Counce.  Milan finished his testimony by explaining that they did enter Tarver's home with guns drawn.  The prosecution called Bay Chief of Police Paul Keith to the stand after Milan. Keith explained he was called by Milan and told of the suspicious bag the family showed him.  When he declared the room a crime scene, Keith said he called the Craighead County Sheriff's Department to assist.  Keith said he helped coordinate the search efforts over the 8 day period when Counce was missing.  When her body was found, Keith said he was called to lock down the scene.  Craighead County Sheriff Marty Boyd was another witness Monday afternoon.  Boyd said Keith called him and informed him of the missing person.  He said he knew the Counce family but did not know who was missing when he arrived at the home.  Boyd said he called other deputies from his department after he arrived.  He explained that he helped direct investigators during the case and received briefings everyday on where they were at in the investigation. Boyd said he was in the area when Tarver was arrested.  The defense cross-examined Boyd and asked him about another suspect.  Boyd said a boyfriend of a relative of Counce's was a suspect but they ruled him out during their investigation. After Boyd left the stand, Joey Bogart replaced him.  Bogart said he saw there was a need for volunteers online and offered his services.  On July 12, 2015 he went to Bay to look for Counce. He said he decided to go to the Farville curve but changed his mind.  Bogart explained his decision took him around a wooded area and to some roads by a corn field.  He said during a pass, he smelled something odd.  Bogart said he located where the smell was coming from and expected to find a dead animal.  While looking through the corn, Bogart said he saw a pair of shoes.  He explained that he realized he found a body and called the police.  Craighead County Coroner Toby Emerson took the stand to explain what he did and saw at the location where Bogart found Counce's body. Emerson said he took photos of the scene, which was a part of his job.  He said she was not alive when he arrived and that there was an apparent hole in the back of the skull. Emerson described the body as being in an advanced stage of decomposition with a large amount of insect involvement.  He said it was very difficult to see the body from the road.  When asked if Counce had died from natural causes, Emerson said in his opinion she did not. Elbert Bradford was another witness who took the stand.  He said he knew the Counce family and wanted to help find her car.  Bradford said he thought Lavinda Counce had a relative who was in the hospital and decided to check.  He said he went to NEA Baptist Hospital with a friend and located her car in the parking lot.  Investigator Gary Etter was the last witness of the day.  He said he went to the hospital after Counce's car was found.  Etter said he received surveillance footage from the hospital, which was shown to the jury.  He described what took place in the video to the jury.  Etter said during the video, Counce's car could be seen driving through the parking lot.  He said when the driver parked, a suspect left the vehicle and began walking down Highway 49. During cross-examination, Etter said he talked to Scott about what they found during the investigation. When Etter left the stand, court was dismissed for the day. Jury selection continued Wednesday, after the court chose 5 jurors at the end of court on Tuesday.  Several potential jurors were excused during questioning.  One was excused because of memory problems and issues related to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  Two females were released because of conflicts with childcare and school, and a man was excused because of implied bias.  At the end of questioning two panels of potential jurors, 11 jurors were chosen. There is one more panel to be questioned. From that last panel, the court must choose one more juror to serve as well as alternate jurors.  A family member of Counce told Region 8 News opening statements begin at 10 a.m. and witnesses will take the stand at 1 p.m. Jury selection continued Tuesday in a Jonesboro courtroom in the case against Tarver.  Eighteen potential jurors were questioned in the morning by the judge, state, and defense. Questions for each juror ranged from personal background, knowledge of or relationship with any possible witnesses, feelings about gun ownership, along with feelings about the death penalty.  Three were released after they gave their opinion of the death penalty.  Jury selection continues until there are 12 jurors selected.  Jury selection began Monday morning for the Lavinda Counce murder trial.  Judge Cindy Thyer is presiding over the State of Arkansas versus Richard Jordon Tarver.  Tarver is charged with seven charges including capital murder, aggravated robbery, kidnapping, aggravated residential burglary, abuse of a corpse, theft of property, and possession of a defaced firearm.  Police arrested Tarver in July 2015 for the murder of Counce.  Potential jurors watched an orientation video and completed questionnaires.  Judge Thyer then dismissed several based on mental or physical impairments and extreme hardships.  Potential jurors will later be divided into groups, and more will be dismissed.  A gag order has been issued for those involved in the case. Region 8 News will continue to track the court preceding all week.  Click here to review the case and view a timeline of the Counce case.  Copyright 2016 KAIT. All rights reserved.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 7 October 2016 | MYT 12:47 PM Wal-Mart plans bigger e-commerce shift, tempers profit view Ramping up e-commerce investments: Wal-Mart reined in its profit expectations as a result of its investments in e-commerce, now forecasting flat earnings for the fiscal year ending Jan 31, 2018, down from a previous forecast of profit growth. — Reuters CHICAGO: Wal-Mart Stores Inc said it plans to focus heavily on its e-commerce operations and warned investors that the cost of the long-term plan would weigh on earnings over the next two years.  The strategy by the world's biggest bricks-and-mortar retailer, which includes slowing the pace of new store openings, is centred on cracking the dominance of Amazon.com Inc in online retailing and face off against other rivals like Target.  Wal-Mart's shares were down 2.9% in afternoon trading at US$69.59 (RM289.28).  "This company over time will look like an e-commerce company," chief executive officer Doug McMillon told investors gathered at Wal-Mart's headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas.  Wal-Mart's plan includes doubling the number of its large warehouses focused on e-commerce sales to 10 in 2016, Reuters reported. It now has the ability to ship to most of the United States in one day.  The company spent more than US$3bil (RM12.47bil) in August to buy e-commerce startup Jet.com, which attracts millennial shoppers, and could help boost sales.  Wal-Mart is looking for online sales growth of 20% to 30% in the second half of this year, excluding the recent sale of Chinese website Yihaodian, and for even faster growth in the next few years.  Online sales currently account for about 3% of total sales.  Wal-Mart reined in its profit expectations as a result of its investments in e-commerce, now forecasting flat earnings for the fiscal year ending Jan 31, 2018, down from a previous forecast of profit growth. It estimated capital expenses at about US$11bil (RM45.72bil), similar to this year.  Fiscal 2019 earnings-per-share growth is now likely to be at the low end of its previous forecast of 5% to 10%.  While the investments in online growth will be a challenge to margins, they are "essential for future-proofing the business for the long run", Cowen & Co analysts said in a research note.  The company has accelerated investments in e-commerce and digital from about US$300mil (RM1.24bil) in 2013 to US$1.1bil (RM4.57bil) this year for a total of about US$3bil (RM12.47bil), excluding acquisitions, according to public filings and earnings reports.  Chief financial officer Brett Biggs said only about 20% of capital spending would go to store openings. Now the company plans to increase revenue from existing stores and its online business instead of new locations, which generated the bulk of growth in the past four years, he added.  In fiscal 2018, Wal-Mart plans to build 35 supercentres compared to 69 last year. It will only open 20 neighbourhood markets from 161 last year. — Reuters Tags / Keywords: Earnings , Foreign News , Corporate News , Analyst Reports , Investing , Technology You May Be Interested Alibaba posts record Singles' Day sales Tech up your cooking Silicon Valley still reeling as reality of Trump presidency sets in Investors see artificial intelligence destroying millions of jobs: poll Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read ‘Add security features at design stage’ CSR isn’t a one-off thing Rafizi found guilty of possessing, disclosing 1MDB audit report advertisement Latest News In Trump tantrum, emerging markets are down but not yet out Fitch: Most Asian telcos to come under pressure in 2017 CMU lands US$10mil gift to study ethical issues in robotics, technology Overwatch will be free to play for a weekend Diary Malaysia 2016 Corporate Earnings Most Viewed in Tech Alibaba posts record Singles' Day sales Get yourself some dimsum Bangladesh retrieves a fifth of US$81mil stolen in cyber heist Overwatch will be free to play for a weekend Tech up your cooking CMU lands US$10mil gift to study ethical issues in robotics, technology Rynet Malaysia offers training for PHP certification Two major Russian banks say hit by cyberattacks Legislature gives final approval to autonomous vehicle bills Audi software can distort emissions in tests, VW says Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File PhotoMore (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc rebuffed a proposal by U.S. prosecutors to pay at least $600 million to settle a corruption probe into the company's practices in markets including Mexico, India and China, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Prosecutors have now gone back to seek more evidence about the company's alleged bribery in Mexico to put pressure on the retailer to settle, Bloomberg reported. (http://bloom.bg/2e5W54p) Some of Wal-Mart's actions in Mexico may be too old to prosecute, the report said. Officials are working to strike a deal with the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company before a new U.S. administration takes over in January, according to the Bloomberg report. Wal-Mart is cooperating fully with the government and compliance with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-corruption laws is a key priority, company spokesman Greg Hitt said. The U.S. Department of Justice has been conducting a long-running investigation into potential misconduct by Wal-Mart, including violations of FCPA, in some overseas markets, including China, Brazil, India and Mexico. Wal-Mart is also facing a class-action lawsuit filed by its shareholders including a Michigan pension fund, accusing it of defrauding shareholders by concealing suspected bribery to help it expand faster in Mexico.

The index's biggest drag today was Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT), which fell more than 2.6% after the retailer forecast weak earnings for the next two years. Let's look at the final numbers on Thursday for the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq: Dow Jones: 18,268.50; -12.53; -0.07% S&P 500: 2,160.77; 1.04; 0.05% Nasdaq: 5,306.85; -9.17; -0.17% Now, here's a look at today's most important market events and stocks, plus a preview of Friday's economic calendar. DJIA Today: Investors Await Friday Jobs Report, Oil Prices Tick Higher The Dow Jones fell 12 points as investors weighed another round of economic data and monitored the approach of Hurricane Matthew. Last week, Americans seeking unemployment benefits nearly hit a 43-year low. The news comes a day before the Department of Labor announces the September unemployment rate. The report will provide a strong influence on the Federal Reserve's pending decision on interest rates in the months ahead. Twitter Inc. (NYSE: TWTR) is in trouble again. Shares had been rallying in recent trading sessions thanks to rumors that suitors were lining up to bid for the microblogging network. However, that speculation appears to have been premature. TWTR stock fell more than 18% after Re/code announced that both Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS) and Alphabet Inc.'s (Nasdaq: GOOGL) Google were unlikely to make any bid for the firm. That leaves Salesforce.com Inc. (NYSE: CRM), which saw shares crater on Wednesday after CEO Marc Benioff talked about a deal. Mizuho analysts warned that a Twitter deal could reduce Salesforce's stock value by as much as 25%. Here's the latest on the TWTR deal and why it looks unlikely. Don't Miss: This is your ticket to bigger and better returns… and it won't cost you a penny. What are you waiting for? Read more… The price of crude oil today was pushing back above $50 per barrel for the first time since June. Last week's announcement by OPEC that it will cap crude production in November has established a floor for prices. Money Morning Global Energy Strategist Dr. Kent Moors has called OPEC's deal a game-changer. However, there is much work to do for the global oil cartel. Moors explains what's next for oil prices and what investors must know about global production. The WTI crude oil price today gained 1.3%. Meanwhile, the Brent crude oil price added nearly 1.4%. But the big story today was at Deutsche Bank AG (USA) (NYSE: DB). The company announced plans to slash more than 1,000 jobs in Germany as part of a larger restructuring plan. The firm will let go of 9,000 employees around the world as the fallout continues from its ongoing liquidity problems. The firm is expected to settle with the Department of Justice in the coming weeks for its peddling of mortgage-backed securities during the financial crisis. Top Stock Market News Today, Oct. 6, 2016 Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE: WFC) is back in the news, and – as always – it's not for good reason. Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) has demanded that Department of Justice shift its attention of the fake account scandal to the firm's executive committee. Thirteen other U.S. senators joined Sanders in a letter that warned DOJ head Loretta Lynch that the agency's investigation of Wells Fargo is a "critical test" of its ability to reign in bad behavior in the future on Wall Street. In deal news, shares of Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) slipped more than 1% after the company announced plans to sell its infusion therapy business to ICU Medical Inc. (Nasdaq: ICUI). The all cash and stock deal is valued at roughly $1 billion. Meanwhile, in cybersecurity news, shares of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) fell 1% after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned Americans about the safety of the firm's insulin pumps. The government agency announced that the medical devices were susceptible to hackers. It was a good day for AquaVenture Holdings Ltd. (Nasdaq: WAAS), which debuted this morning on the public markets. Shares of the water management firm rallied more than 23.5% from its issue price of $18. In earnings news, shares of Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE: YUM) fell more than 1.7% after the company fell short of earnings expectations after the bell Wednesday. According to Estimize, the company met Wall Street EPS expectations of $1.09, but fell well short of revenue expectations. The company announced that same-store sales in China were far less than analysts had anticipated. After the bell, look for additional reports from Ruby Tuesday Inc. (NYSE: RT), Helen of Troy Ltd. (Nasdaq: HELE), Mistras Group Inc. (NYSE: MG), and Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (Nasdaq: CMTL).

The world’s largest retailer completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it’s willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. It also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. Average U.S. 30-Year Mortgage Rate Unchanged at 3.42 Percent WASHINGTON (AP) – Long-term U.S. mortgage rates didn’t move this week, remaining at their lowest levels since mid-July as a lure to prospective homebuyers. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was unchanged from last week at 3.42 percent. The benchmark rate is down from 3.76 percent a year ago and close to its all-time low of 3.31 percent in November 2012. The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage, popular with homeowners who are refinancing, stayed at 2.72 percent. U.S. Farmers Make Foray Into Quinoa As Demand for Grain Grows SEQUIM, Wash. (AP) – A small number of U.S. farmers are trying to capitalize on American eaters’ growing demand for the Andean grain, quinoa. Americans consume more than half the global production of quinoa, which totaled 37,000 tons in 2012. Twenty years earlier, production was merely 600 tons, according to the United Nation’s Food and Agricultural Organization. Quinoa’s nutritional punch has pushed the grain beyond health food stores and into general consumption. Yet quinoa fields are so rare in American farming that the total acreage doesn’t show on an agricultural census. Federal Government: Mylan Has Been Overcharging for EpiPens TRENTON, N.J. (AP) – Even the federal government is apparently paying too much for EpiPens. The skyrocketing price of the life-saving allergy shot, which has triggered a storm of criticism, is only part of the problem. Now the federal government says Medicaid has been paying too much for EpiPens for years because the emergency shot is classified incorrectly as a generic medicine. The federal government says EpiPen is a branded drug, which means the drug’s maker, Mylan, should have been paying the government a far higher rebate under the government’s complex pricing rules. Mylan denies wrongdoing but could face steep penalties.

NEW YORK — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to slow its new store openings and pour more money into its online efforts, technology and store remodels, the company said Thursday. The world's largest retailer also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. Wal-Mart completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it's willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. “This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company,” CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company's annual investment meeting. Wal-Mart shares fell $1.52, or 2 percent, to $70.15 in afternoon trading. Like its direct store rivals, Wal-Mart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com, whose Prime shopping program is swiftly converting members into loyal shoppers. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers such as Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. But Wal-Mart has seen its investments online and in the stores pay off — and it's starting to gain ground over some of the competitors. It has launched a flurry of changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. The company has 150 fresh food managers working to train store sales associates. Wal-Mart also is melding online services with its massive fleet of stores. It rolled out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it's pushing ahead with online grocery and pickup services. Greg Foran, CEO and president of Wal-Mart's U.S. namesake business, told analysts Thursday that by the end of the year, it will have grocery online pickup services at 600 U.S. stores. The company is in the second year of its $2.7 billion investment in its workers that involves higher pay and more training. It says that such investments, as well as the other moves, are already helping to improve customer service in the stores. Wal-Mart had raised its annual profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth straight quarterly increase in revenue of stores opened at least a year and the seventh quarterly gain in customer traffic at its namesake Wal-Mart U.S. business. Global online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter. That's up from the 7 percent pace of the first quarter but still far weaker than the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago. In contrast, Target reported that a key revenue measure was down 1.1 percent in the second quarter, after seven straight quarters of gains. And it saw fewer customers in the store for the first time in a year and a half. Target is struggling to get its groceries right, and it didn't push the second part of its “Expect More, Pay Less” slogan. McMillon reiterated to analysts Thursday that he believes the Jet.com acquisition will help it attract higher-income and younger customers. The company plans to incorporate some of Jet.com's technology that lowers prices in real time. As part of the deal, Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, is overseeing both the site and Walmart.com. “I look around and see the vast assets,” Lore told investors Thursday. “This is the perfect time to accelerate the business.” Foran said Lore will be working to increasingly get the store and online selections to match, so if customers see something in the store, they'll know they can find it online. The retailer still has plenty of challenges, notably in China, and it's struggling in the United Kingdom and Brazil. It announced Wednesday that it was increasing its stake in JD.com, China's No. 2 e-commerce site, to 10.8 percent from 5.9 percent. That comes nearly four months after Wal-Mart bought an initial stake in JD.com in a deal that also gave JD.com ownership of the Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian, including the brand and app. Wal-Mart said Thursday it would spend $11 billion on capital expenditures this year, and the same for the following fiscal year. In the fiscal year ended in January, the company spent $11.5 billion on capital expenditures. But Wal-Mart said it will be investing more of that money in e-commerce and digital initiatives. The company also said it plans to open 130 U.S. stores this year, but that's below its forecast issued last year that it would open 135 to 155 new stores. In its last fiscal year, it opened 230 U.S. stores. It said it plans to open another 55 U.S. stores next year. By type of store, Wal-Mart plans to open 60 supercenters and 70 of the smaller-format Neighborhood Markets this year. For next year, the breakdown is 35 supercenters and 20 smaller-format stores. Wal-Mart reiterated that its earnings per share for the current year on an adjusted basis would be $4.15 per share to $4.35 per share on an adjusted basis.

Wal-Mart shooting suspect appears in court By Jessica Prokop The Columbian (Vancouver, Wash.) Twitter Facebook Email Reddit Shaun Michael Sprague, 35, of Sheridan, Wyoming, appeared Thursday in Clark County Superior Court on suspicion of second-degree assault stemming from the Wal-Mart shooting and first-degree arson in an unrelated residential fire in Hazel Dell on Tuesday. Sprague wore a suicide-prevention smock – given to prisoners who may try to harm themselves with standard jail clothing – and appeared to be a bit dazed during the proceeding. Judge Gregory Gonzales asked Sprague several times if he understood his rights and repeated them one at a time. Sprague told jail officials that he suffers from mental health problems, according to court documents. His court-appointed attorney, Gerry Wear, said he may raise competency issues at a later date. Deputy Prosecutor Randy St. Clair asked Gonzales to find probable cause for second-degree assault in the shooting, rather than the three counts of first-degree assault referred by law enforcement. Gonzales found probable cause exists in both cases. Clark County sheriff’s deputies detained Sprague just before 7 a.m. inside the Wal-Mart at 9000 N.E. Highway 99 after a 911 caller reported an active shooter at the store, according to the sheriff’s office. No one was shot or injured during the incident. Sprague had a revolver on him and reportedly fired shots near the Subway restaurant inside the store near the front entrance, according to a probable cause affidavit filed in Superior Court. The store had been open for about an hour when the shooting occurred. Employees and shoppers either evacuated or sheltered in place, sheriff’s office spokesman Sgt. Fred Neiman said. Officers searched the store for potential victims and accomplices, but none were located. Assault case Jake Bodle, a Subway manager, told the Columbian on Wednesday that he spoke with Sprague earlier in the morning. He said he was outside smoking when Sprague approached him and asked for a cigarette. Bodle declined. Sprague then came into the store and told Bodle he wanted a sandwich. Bodle said the Wal-Mart restaurant wasn’t open yet but that he’d make him a sandwich once he was done preparing for the day, the affidavit states. Bodle told detectives that he was in and out of the back room setting up the restaurant, and when he walked back to the front counter, he saw Sprague point a gun toward merchandise in the store. Sprague fired six shots and then placed the revolver on a nearby table, according to court documents. Bodle fled to the back area and saw Sprague fire two more shots in the same direction, before placing the gun on the table again, court records said. A manager at Wal-Mart called 911, and deputies arrived within five to 10 minutes and detained Sprague. During an interview with police, Sprague said he’s owned the revolver for about five years, according to the affidavit. He went into the Wal-Mart because he was cold and wet, he said, and planned to kill himself but changed his mind, court documents said. While at the Clark County Jail, he told officers that he had used “speed” – a term for amphetamines – a couple of days before the shooting and said, “none of this would have happened before I used that (expletive),” court records show. Arson case In the arson case, Sprague allegedly set a kitchen fire Tuesday at the home he was staying at in the 3000 block of Northeast 75th Street. He dipped a pair of fuzzy dice in gasoline, lit them on fire and placed them inside a kitchen cabinet, a separate probable cause affidavit states. A roommate, Artem Popov, told officers that he went to bed at about 11 p.m. the night before and awoke to the sound of the smoke detector and smell of smoke. He went downstairs and found a fire in a kitchen cabinet and extinguished it, court records said. He then smelled rotten eggs and found that the gas line had been disconnected to the water heater in the garage. Sprague was the only other person at the house when Popov went to bed, he said, and there were no signs of forced entry, according to court documents. During his court appearance, St. Clair said it appears that Sprague is a transient and has some criminal history in Wyoming, mostly convictions for driving while under the influence and criminal trespassing. Gonzales set his bail at $80,000 between the two cases. Sprague will be arraigned Oct. 20.

Wal-Mart also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. The company's shares fell $2.31, or 3.2 percent, to $69.36 Thursday. — Associated Press Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW Lenovo Flex 3 Skylake i7 16" Touch Laptop for $500 + free...

The world’s largest retailer also tempered its outlook, saying it anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings per share being about flat with its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share. It foresees fiscal 2019 earnings per share growth of about 5 percent. Wal-Mart completed its more than $3 billion buyout of the fast-growing online retailer Jet.com last month, showing how heavily it’s willing to invest to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of its annual revenue. “This company is going to look more like an e-commerce company,” CEO Doug McMillon told analysts at the company’s annual investment meeting. Wal-Mart shares fell $1.52, or 2 percent, to $70.15 in trading. Like its direct store rivals, Wal-Mart is trying to be more nimble as it fights off competition from online leader Amazon.com, whose Prime shopping program is swiftly converting members into loyal shoppers. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions. But Wal-Mart has seen its investments online and in the stores pay off — and it’s starting to gain ground over some of the competitors. It has launched a flurry of changes, from making sure its vegetables look good to cleaning up its stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. The company has 150 fresh food managers working to train sales associates. Wal-Mart is also melding online services with its massive fleet of stores. It rolled out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it’s pushing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. Greg Foran, CEO and president of Wal-Mart’s U.S. namesake business, told analysts Thursday that by the end of the year, it will have grocery online pickup services at 600 U.S. stores. The company is in the second year of its $2.7 billion investment in its workers that involves higher pay and more training. It said that such investments are already helping to improve customer service in the stores. Wal-Mart had raised its annual profit outlook in August after reporting its eighth straight quarterly increase in revenue of stores opened at least a year and the seventh quarterly gain in customer traffic at its namesake Wal-Mart U.S. business. Global online sales rose 11.8 percent in the second quarter. That’s up from the 7 percent pace of the first quarter but still far weaker than the 20 percent increases from less than two years ago. McMillon reiterated to analysts Thursday that he believes the Jet.com acquisition will help it attract higher-income and younger customers. The company plans to incorporate some of Jet.com’s technology that lowers prices in real time. As part of the deal, Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, is overseeing both the site and Walmart.com. “I look around and see the vast assets,” Lore told investors Thursday. “This is the perfect time to accelerate the business.” Foran said that Lore will be working to increasingly get the store and online selections to match, so if customers see something in the store, they’ll know they can find it online. The company also said that it plans to open 130 U.S. stores this year, but that’s below its forecast issued last year that it would open 135 to 155 new stores. In its last fiscal year, it opened 230 U.S. stores. It said it plans to open another 55 U.S. stores next year.

The business had its grand opening on September 16. This year Lansing has added some exciting new businesses, with more to come, ranging from restaurants and boutiques to fitness and industrial facilities. While most residents notice the retail spots, there has also been growth in other areas, including the addition of Dedicated Leasing Transportation Company, which opened on the west end of town, and a specialty contractor, International Quality Contracting, which works in medical buildouts. A soon-to-be-built Planet Fitness will occupy the former PetSmart building next to the new Wal-Mart location, which opened earlier this year. Cumbia Fitness also opened recently, offering Zumba classes in a location just off of Ridge Road in the downtown area. According to Travis Bandstra, director of economic development, a new barbecue restaurant called Champions II BBQ is nearly ready for business. “They’re opening soon at 17659 Torrence in front of Wal-Mart,” he says. Another local barbecue restaurant is planning both a move and expansion. Lynnie Que’s, which has operated a carry-out and catering business on Burnham Avenue for eight years, will relocate into a building at the Lansing Municipal Airport. The full service restaurant and bar, called Lynnie Que’s Airport Bar and Grill, is expected to be open by early November, according to owner Lynn Cartwright. Another restaurant that is new to Lansing this year is Bohemian Joe’s, which opened in January occupying the former Popolano’s building at 17940 Torrence Avenue. Offering an eclectic menu of American cuisine in a completely renovated and redesigned space, it features weekly specials, craft beers and occasional live entertainment. Some new storefronts can be found on Ridge Road, including the Simply Gorgeous Boutique, A. A. McCull Men’s Haberdashery and the Bunker (carrying military surplus items and antique gear). A new entertainment spot called UNLOCKaLOCK Escape Room just held its grand opening. At the venue groups of two to eight work together, solving clues to unlock themselves from a themed room within a one-hour time frame. Visits are by appointment only. "We are excited to bring this trending adventure to Lansing and its surrounding areas. This town has been very supportive to our arrival," says co-owner Valerie DeMay. “It’s unique, fun and intense,” adds co-owner Jodi Bonk. “We are bringing back the art of communication and teamwork.” +3 Lansing Autumn Fest returns for 5th year While the festival season has ended in many places, Lansing is getting geared up for its big… +3 New downtown Lansing plaza to highlight village’s history A lot situated at the southwest corner of Burnham Avenue and Ridge Road will soon be transfo… Tags Lansing Local Business Dedicated Leasing Transportation International Quality Contracting Planet Fitness Cumbia Fitness Champions Ii Bbq Lynnie Que's Bohemian Joe's Unlockalock Escape Room Restaurant Barbecue Storefront Wal-mart Fitness Travis Bandstra Latest in section Ladies and gentlemen and children of all ages Election was about much more than Trump Trump could lift, or sink, NWI economy Historic Marktown almost 100, but future uncertain Slideshow: Professionals on the move Most Popular on nwi.com FBI raids Lake County sheriff's offices; searches may have Porter ties Coroner IDs two people found dead in Lowell Truck driver dies after accident at ArcelorMittal-Burns Harbor Trucker killed at ArcelorMittal Burns Harbor steel mill identified Man punches out worker, robs Griffith store Local Companies | FindTheCompany Currents +3 National News Are 'ballot selfies' legal where you live? +18 Movies Awards season kicks off with the Hollywood Film Awards +19 Sports Photos: 19 times squirrels interrupted sporting events Today’s top pics: Veterans Day observances and more Hallelujah - RIP Leonard Cohen Your daily 6: A final 'Hallelujah;' Hillary takes a hike Today In History, Nov. 11: WWI Armistice Kane helps Blackhawks hand Canadiens 2nd regulation loss The Way We See It: After Week 10, which head coaches are safe and who may be on the hot seat?

The dead were alive and wandering the city core. Women with white eyes, men with bloodied clothes and gashed faces, and children with graying, veiny skin took to the streets Saturday, Oct. 8, for what has become an annual Halloween-season event, the Zombie Walk, started in about 2008 by a "very disturbed group of friends." "What is there to say, we're dead. They've probably already recycled our (Social Security) numbers," reads the event Facebook page. The outfits were ugly. The faces deliberately mutilated. "This is our month," said Laurie Harwood of Jackson who was wearing curlers in her hair and a bloodied housecoat with sneakers. "Any opportunity to dress up, get out, and have fun." She and her husband, Robert, in a blond mullet, coined themselves zombie Wal-Mart shoppers. They were participating for the third time and had trashed clothing they found at consignment stores. Wal-Mart bags filled with body parts served as accessories. There were also Star Wars characters and two men dressed in elaborate handcrafted getups as members of the grotesquely dressed metal band Gwar. Andy McCrory, a local tattooist and artist, created the frightening, but impressive costumes with foam, molds and other materials. Wayne Palmer came all the way from Columbus, Ohio, not to show off his costume, but his ride, a 2007 Dodge Durango outfitted as a zombie-mobile. It drips blood, imprisons a dead child and has plastic spikes on its front. Palmer likes October and gore and has been driving his SUV to various shows, conventions and other events for years, even before the AMC show "The Walking Dead" brought zombies to the mainstream. Sometimes he just parks in at a grocery store and watches the curious crowd form. He is a truck driver, so the miles to Michigan did not bother him, and he enjoys the reaction he draws on the highway. "You don't do this if you don't want attention."

The woman used a credit card to pay for the gift card, but the credit card was declined. The offender distracted the clerk, who had started the transaction on the cash register but had not completed it because the credit card was denied. The clerk turned her back and the offender hit the cash button on the register. This triggered the computer system to believe the offender had given the cashier the money for the gift card. The offender hid the gift card, now with the $487 added, in her pocket and presented a new gift card to the cashier. The clerk was not aware that this was a new gift card and that it had no money on it.

Earleywine told reporters Friday that he essentially was given his walking papers by then-athletic director Mack Rhoades early into an investigation of alleged verbal abuse of players. File photo by Daniel Brenner The Associated Press i By Tod Palmer tpalmer@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Missouri softball coach Ehren Earleywine essentially was given his walking papers by then-athletic director Mack Rhoades early into an investigation of alleged verbal abuse of players. “It was probably mid-March and Mack called a meeting with me,” Earleywine said. “No pleasantries, he basically looked at me and said, ‘You need to start looking for another job.’ That was pretty much the end of the conversation.” Two months later, the investigation went public after a group of players announced they were playing in protest of the investigation. The Star learned in late May that he was under a Title IX investigation as well. Earleywine spoke with reporters for the first time since the end of last season after the first game of the fall slate Friday at University Field in Columbia. “The rest of the second half of the season was extremely difficult, knowing that I wasn’t going to be the coach here and trying to be invested while at the same time knowing I was being booted,” he said. “It was a difficult thing, but I managed.” The investigation continued into August before Missouri announced Earleywine had been cleared of wrongdoing in the Office for Civil Rights and Title IX’s investigation. Two weeks later, Mizzou announced Earleywine would be retained for the 2016-17 season after a meeting with executive associate athletic directors Tim Hickman, who is the administrator in charge of softball, and Sarah Reesman, who was the department’s interim athletic director. New athletic director Jim Sterk signed off on the decision and “has been in my corner since he got here,” Earleywine said. Still, the months-long investigation had an impact on Earleywine. “It makes me cautious of what I say and what I do,” he said of the fallout from the investigation. “ … The days of coaching on instinct and passion may be a thing of the past. I’m a little bit more cautious, and you have to pick your words a little more carefully, because we’re in a place in our country that I don’t like. “I think everybody’s so politically correct now that people get their feelings hurt and kids have more power than they should have. The inmates run the prison a lot of times. It’s a shame, but it’s where we’re at and I either need to adapt to it or ring a bell at Walmart of something, because those are my two options right now.” Sterk said last month that Earleywine wasn’t placed on a social contract that outlined expected behavior moving forward, but Earleywine said Friday he’s agreed to a “list of conditions” that he must adhere to or risk discipline, up to and including dismissal, in the wake of the investigation. “Quite honestly, I feel 110 percent confident that I’ll be able to meet all those expectations,” Earleywine said. “ … I think I’m just being watched a little bit closer on those things, and that’s fine. I’ve proved people wrong my entire life. I think there’s a lot of people that don’t think I could adhere to something like that, but I will and those people motivate me to do that.” Part of Earleywine’s confidence also stems from a better rapport with Sterk. “I’m super-excited about his leadership and the direction that he’s taking our athletic department,” Earleywine said. “I think he’s headed us in a different direction than we were in and I think it was important that we got that. I’m really excited about his leadership, his temperament, his experience. Everything I’ve seen so far, I’m a fan.” When Rhoades resigned in mid-July to accept a job as Baylor’s athletic director, Earleywine — a native of Jefferson City and lifelong Mizzou fan — had renewed hope he might keep his job. “I knew from the minute I heard that he was leaving for Baylor that things were going to be different and I was just hoping and praying for a great guy, a great leader and I couldn’t be more happy than I am with Jim,” Earleywine said. Does he think the investigation became personal with Rhoades? “Maybe, I can’t say for certain, because I’m not in Mack’s head, but I think that behind closed doors I’m probably not his favorite person in the world,” Earleywine said. “But I don’t know how much of that weighed into his decision to analyze whether or not I should be coming back or not. You’d have to ask him that.” Asked if he felt he was treated fairly, Earleywine — after a pause — said, “I probably shouldn’t answer that.” He believes the investigation should have been dropped “the first day and moved along with things, but that’s just me,” Earleywine said. If he has a regret about the situation, it’s that it prolonged an already tumultuous and difficult year for Mizzou, which also endured a football boycott in November amid protests sparked by a series of racist episodes. Earleywine said his “educated guess” as to why he wasn’t fired in midseason — after that meeting with Rhoades — was an effort to avoid disrupting the season for the team “and probably was hoping that I would fade calmly into the sunset.” That, of course, didn’t happen. “Obviously, it didn’t turn out like that, and it ended up being quite a black eye for all of us,” Earleywine said. “That’s the thing I regret more than anything. Before being a softball coach at Missouri, I’m a Missouri fan, and it’s bothered me what’s happened — not just with that incident, but, over the last year or two, some of the things that have gone down. None of us like it, and I didn’t want to be a contributor to that. I felt like that situation was just another nick and, to be a part of that, made me sick. I wish it wouldn’t have gone down like that, but I’m not the one who started it.” Earleywine is 453-154 in 10 seasons at Mizzou, including an NCAA regional appearance each season and eight trips to the super regionals. The Tigers reached the Women’s College World Series three straight years during 2009-11. “I’ve had days that were really hard, that equaled the pain that we felt last year, but nothing over that amount of time,” Earleywine said. “It just wore on me. It wore on our team. It wore on our fans. It was a burden for all of us to bear.” Earleywine sought counseling to address some of the issues central to the investigation, including adjustments to the language he uses with the team, and has a new mentality after the ordeal. “It gave me a new appreciation for the reason that I got into this in the first place was to teach softball,” he said. “I love this game. Last year, when I was carrying this burden around, I couldn’t really think about that, because there was the weight of everything else.” More from Earleywine: ▪ There has been substantial turnover during the last season. That’s in terms of players — with pitchers Paige Lowary transferring to Oklahoma and Tori Finucane leaving for Minnesota among seven defections since the start of the 2016 season — and staff. Longtime pitching coach and ace recruiter Pete D’Amour also left, becoming head coach at Kennesaw State. He took MU volunteer assistant Doug Gillis with him as the Owls’ new pitching coach. “I’m going to miss Pete as a friend more than anything,” Earleywine said. “We’ve been through a lot together. He’s a great friend and he’s a great person.” Earleywine said he has identified D’Amour’s replacement, but some paperwork still needs to be signed before a formal announcement. ▪ Earleywine said the investigation hasn’t impacted recruiting. Of the 25 players in eighth through 12th grades who were committed to the Tigers, none de-committed — a fact he attributes to personal relationships. According to Earleywine, the 2017 recruiting class is the third-ranked collection of prospects in the country. “I don’t think this is going to be the best team I’ve ever had, but we’re going to be competitive once again and we’re going to be competitive at the national level,” Earleywine said. “That’s saying something after the year we’ve been through.” ▪ There’s ample reason for excitement for Earleywine and his team, which should move into a new stadium in March. “Our first home game will be Oregon on a Friday night on March 3, and they’re saying that the timeline is March 1 for the completion of the stadium,” Earleywine said. “I would think that would be awesome night to start against a great team like that on a Friday night and that place would be full.” Tod Palmer: 816-234-4389, @todpalmer Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story University of Missouri Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 7:50 Mizzou senior linebacker Michael Scherer discusses injury, career Pause 2:30 Marcus Peters on forced fumble: 'I took it from him' 3:37 Chiefs use pair of turnovers to top Panthers in 17-point comeback 2:32 Firefighters battle blaze after explosion at historic downtown KC church 1:56 AFC West: Best division in the conference? 0:28 Dee Ford on his sack psychology 0:44 Royals' Salvador Perez makes a splash at Shark Tank Teacher Edition 3:49 Bill Self breaks down KU's overtime loss to Indiana 0:34 Dee Ford got his sack, Chris Jones wanted his 3:00 Trump vows to be a president for all Americans Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 8 days ago Mizzou Minute: Tod Palmer breaks down the loss at South Carolina 5:16 8 days ago Mizzou Minute: Tod Palmer breaks down the loss at South Carolina 8:23 8 days ago Barry Odom reacts to Mizzou's loss at South Carolina 6:30 11 days ago Mizzou defensive coordinator DeMontie Cross on changes to the defense View more video University of Missouri Missouri crushes Alabama A&M 99-44 in season opener KU beats MU 1-0 in sudden death in NCAA women’s soccer tourney Mizzou lands commitment from Louisiana defensive end Missouri’s Kevin Pendleton emerges as anchor despite adversity back home Mizzou beats Vanderbilt 26-17 for first SEC win of season Sports Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Home Delivery E-Star Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Newspapers in Education Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter Mobile apps and E-Star Mobile Alerts Newsletters Advertising Advertising information Print Digital Place a Classified Find&Save Local Shopping Copyright Commenting Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Service Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Home Delivery E-Star Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Newspapers in Education Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter Mobile apps and E-Star Mobile Alerts Newsletters Advertising Advertising information Print Digital Place a Classified Find&Save Local Shopping More Copyright Commenting Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Service

At least 10 people were killed across the Southeastern U.S. as the devastating storm was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane and lumbered toward landfall just north of Charleston, near the town of McClellanville. The winds dropped to 75 mph, down from a recorded 145 mph at the height of the storm’s severity when it ripped across Haiti, killing nearly 900. Matthew whipped the coastlines of Georgia and South Carolina with torrential rain and stiff winds as its storm center blew ashore.

As the storm passed one city after another, the reaction was one of relief — that things were nowhere near as bad as many feared. “We are all blessed that Matthew stayed off our coast,” Florida Gov. Rick Scott said. “We are blessed that we didn’t have a direct hit.” The powerful hurricane killed at least four people in Florida and left more than 1 million homes and businesses without electricity. (PHELAN EBENHACK/REUTERS) At least five deaths in Florida and two in Georgia were attributed to the storm, and North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory said three people were killed in his state. Death tolls rises to over 800 in Haiti from Hurricane Matthew The Florida fatalities included an elderly couple in St. Lucie and two women killed in separate incidents as trees crushed their homes. “Now is the time for prayer,” South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said as the storm approached. Matthew was approaching Charleston early Saturday, where a curfew was in place between midnight and 6 a.m. (JONATHAN DRAKE/REUTERS) More than a million people were under evacuation orders in north Florida and Georgia’s coastal regions as roughly 300,000 people fled their homes in South Carolina. “We have been very fortunate that Matthews’s strongest winds have remained a short distance offshore of the Florida and Georgia coasts thus far, but this should not be a reason to let down our guard,” the Hurricane Center said in a forecast statement.

(NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images) And the power began coming back on for the 1 million people in Florida who were in the dark for roughly 24 hours. Not eveyone was spared. The ravaging storm — the worst to threaten the Atlantic Seaboard in more than 10 years — killed at least 877 people in Haiti and left tens of thousands homeless.

(NICOLAS GARCIA/AFP/Getty Images) Many of the island nation’'s impoverished areas reported that cholera outbreaks were already claiming lives as the storm made its way north. Northern Floridan, Georgia and the Carolinas were still dealing with flood waters in many areas. St. Augustine, Fla., the nation’s oldest European settlement, was experiencing severe flooding that authorities said could exceed 8 feet Saturday. A 17th century Spanish fortress and other historic structures were in the water’s path. The massive storm was expected to severely flood several historic cities across the East Coast of the U.S. (JONATHAN DRAKE/REUTERS) “It’s a really serious devastating situation,” Mayor Nancy Shaver said. “The flooding is just going to get higher and higher and higher.” Steve Todd, who defied the mayor’s evacuation orders and stayed at his home in Tybee Island — one of the Georgia’s most eastern points — described seeing bushes fly by the windows of his third-story condo, where he hunkered down with friends. “I’m not regretting staying,” he said over the phone. “But I’m not going to lie: There’s a little bit of nervous tension right now.” Stacks of sandbags clogged the streets of Charleston, another historic town lined with colonial homes. Stores and shops in the downtown area had boarded up their windows with plywood and the usually bustling area was eerily quiet as the city announced a midnight to 6 a.m. curfew.

Bloomberg photo by Michael Short   Mark Bergen and Mark Gurman Bloomberg     Google unveiled new hardware from smartphones and smart speakers to wireless routers on Tuesday. It was a yearlong odyssey that involved design, supply chain negotiations and the search for a manufacturing partner. Now the Alphabet Inc. unit must grapple with the equally daunting challenge of getting the gadgets to consumers. It has a history of retail strategies that either struggled or never got off the ground, according to people familiar with the company's retail efforts. What's more, it's inexperienced dealing with returns and recycling. And unlike rival Apple Inc., the company lacks its own stores where it can showcase hardware as it pleases and instead relies on other companies' in-store displays. This time, the stakes are higher because the latest gadgets are vehicles for Google's digital assistant, a key product that is chasing Amazon.com Inc.'s Alexa and Apple's Siri. "We view go-to-market as a clear hurdle to wide acceptance, which will require investments in brand, marketing and distribution to overcome," UBS analyst Eric Sheridan wrote in a note to investors. Google is selling the new Pixel phones at Verizon Communications and Best Buy stores in the U.S., via its own online store, a temporary physical store in New York City and through its wireless service Project Fi. It's working with a small number of other wireless carriers and retailers in countries including Germany and India. Google Home, the new speaker, is available at Best Buy, Wal-Mart Stores and Target stores, in addition to Google's online store. Cutting distribution deals with a handful of carriers and retailers isn't enough, according to Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson. "Google will have to up its customer-service game and do many more distribution partnerships," he said. Many of Google's past efforts at selling hardware have fizzled. When the company started its Nexus brand in 2010 it planned to market the phones online only, but sales never took off. About 200,000 of the first Nexus model sold, short of Google's target of several million units, according to a person who worked on the device. Then there was Android Silver. Kicked off some time in 2014, the internal project was designed to sell high-end Android handsets with partners to compete with Apple. Google set up a retail lab for the effort, claiming an entire building near its Mountain View, California headquarters, according to former employees. But it never got off the ground. Nikesh Arora, Google's sales chief at the time, drove the initiative. When he left in July 2014, Android Silver was shelved. One former Google executive called it a boondoggle. The former Googlers didn't want to be identified discussing private information. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment. Such experiments are a contrast to Apple stores that are the envy of the retail industry. Apple considers the iPhone in terms of the product's complete life cycle, from leaving the factory to when customers stop using the device. Apple offers a recycling program through physical and online stores. Google's new smartphone unit approached potential wireless carrier partners early this year, according to a person familiar with the situation. Some carriers peppered Google executives with questions about handling phone returns and technical support, the person said. At the time, Google did not appear ready to take on these aspects of the phone hardware business, according to this person. Google executives on the hardware team say the company is on a "journey," gaining experience and capabilities with each smartphone generation. And Apple only began touting the iPhone's full life cycle after a few generations. On Tuesday, as a Google event began in San Francisco, new hardware chief Rick Osterloh reassured the audience that the company was serious about the move. "We're in it for the long run," he said. About nine months after initial talks with carriers, Google rolled out its flavor of technical support: Pixels have built-in chat support where customer-service reps can take over smartphone screens to identify problems. Google will be responsible for returns and recycling and is building a supply chain that can reabsorb faulty and rejected devices, Osterloh said in a recent interview. Osterloh will be partly judged by how many devices Google sells, a contrast to the Nexus program which showcased Android features for other handset makers to adopt. But the executive was still cagey about the company's sales aspirations. "In markets where we do business, we're definitely going to want meaningful share," he said. "But it's highly unlikely that the primary driver will be to be in every market with as high as possible volume." Google still sees software as its edge, rather than retail distribution and customer service. The company spent more time on Tuesday talking about the digital assistant baked into its new gadgets, and how they work together. If Google can get millions of people relying on its assistant, the company may be able to compete with Apple's devices, according to Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner. "The AI assistant will give them something that Apple has enjoyed for many years: Lock-in to the system," he said.

Wal-Mart announced at its October 6th Investor's meeting that it "plans to slow new-store openings," shifting its capital investments towards e-commerce technology. In its superstore segment, Wal-Mart will drop from 69 new big box stores in FY 16, to 60 in FY 17, and only 35 by FY 18. In his comments, Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon flatly stated: "We are a company that must become more of an e-commerce and technology company. There's no doubt that e-commerce is going to become a much more important part of our business." Without once mentioning his desperate fixation on catching rival Amazon, McMillon promised customers a "fast and easy" shopping experience "when, where and how they want." Wal-Mart's super-saturation of the retail landscape with big box stores, sometimes as close as two miles apart, is well into its Ice Age. The huge Dinostores, once seen as the dominant species of retailing, are now viewed as ill-adapted to the climate change overtaking the marketplace, most notably the global warm-up of online shopping. Wal-Mart became over-reliant on these vast retail caverns, hard to navigate and time-consuming to shop. Now they are trying to catch up to the Amazon model of fulfillment warehouses strategically placed around the globe. Wal-Mart's Retail Ice Age is a result of its own misreading of the market. As I wrote in this space nine months ago: "Wal-Mart headquarters announced January 15th that the company will close a total of 269 stores world-wide, of which 154 are locations in the U.S. This store implosion represents the end of the line for Wal-Mart's smallest format, the so-called Wal-Mart Express. But it also reveals the giant retailer's over-saturation of American markets." Last January, McMillon, tried to put a shine on these closures by reminding the media that "we'll open well more than 300 stores around the world next year. So we are committed to growing, but we are being disciplined about it." Translation: Wal-Mart will only be opening 50 to 60 Supercenters in America this coming year---which pales to its halcyon sprawl years in the 1980s when it cut-ribbons at a 250 to 350 store clip per year. Even as late as 2007, Wal-Mart's Annual Report said the retailer's "planned expenditures will include the construction of...265 to 270 new supercenters." No doubt Wall Street will reward Wal-Mart for finally showing some "discipline" in its bricks and mortar store growth--but in its own Q&A format interview with McMillon, the company disclosed a very telling metric: "More than 95% of the stores closing in the U.S. are within 10 miles on average of another Walmart." In other words, Wal-Mart reached the point of store saturation years ago, and is only acting on that now. No retail trade area needs a Wal-Mart every ten miles. The stores that were chalked for closure last January were, frankly, redundant. Wal-Mart has been cannibalizing its own stores for years by over-saturating market penetration. In 2007, John Menzer, Wal-Mart's Chief Administrative Officer, told shareholders: "We also have been focused this year on reducing cannibalization of existing stores via our more strategic selection of U.S. real estate projects... As we continue to add new stores in the United States, we do so with an understanding that additional stores may take sales away from existing units." That was nearly 9 years ago. What does this mean for local communities? The prospect of only 35 new superstore by 2018 lifts a great burden off the backs of local communities that have been fighting Goliath with slingshot coalitions since the early 1990s. I have catalogued a list of 450 communities that have blocked superstore sprawl at least once. Slashing new store production by 50% means that roughly 900 acres of land will be spared a blanket of asphalt and concrete, the environmental damages from huge developments will be reduced, and hundreds of local businesses will remain open for business. As McMillon admitted, shifting the business model away from superstores means "running our business with more sustainable practices." The Dinostores are dying. Wal-Mart knows it. Shoppers know it. Perhaps by FY 19 Wal-Mart will be announcing no new superstore units at all, and the widespread closure of its outdated concrete mausoleums. That will be a glorious day, indeed.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Lindsey Bever October 8 Follow @lindseybever (York-Poquoson Sheriff’s Office) Authorities in eastern Virginia who were responding to a car crash earlier this week inadvertently stumbled upon a mobile meth lab. The York-Poquoson Sheriff’s Office said deputies discovered a meth lab inside a minivan Thursday morning when the deputies smelled odors “consistent with the production and manufacturing of methamphetamines” spilling from the vehicle along U.S. Route 17 in York County. Authorities secured the area and rerouted traffic for several hours while lab personnel in Hazmat suits searched the mobile meth lab, police said. They uncovered “items and chemicals used to produce methamphetamines, containers actively cooking methamphetamines, methamphetamine, a syringe and small amount of marijuana,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement. Sheriff’s office spokesman Lt. Dennis Ivey told The Washington Post “there was stuff mixing up” inside the van when deputies found it. Police said the driver, Robert C. Copley Jr., was charged with manufacturing methamphetamine, conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine and possession of marijuana; a 27-year-old woman, Jennifer D. Kendrick, was charged with possession of methamphetamine. Police said Copley is 37 years old, but online booking records indicate that he is 38. The suspects are in custody at Virginia Peninsula Regional Jail, according to booking records. Court-appointed attorneys for Copley and Kendrick were not immediately available for comment. [A suspected meth lab beneath a Walmart parking lot has officials ‘completely astounded’] The Justice Department’s former National Drug Intelligence Center once released warnings about methamphetamine laboratories. It stated: Methamphetamine laboratories may be located virtually anywhere. Laboratories have been found in secluded rural areas as well as in residential, commercial, and industrial districts. Law enforcement officers have seized laboratories at private residences, commercial properties, hotels and motels, and outdoor locations. Mobile laboratories have been discovered in automobiles, boats, and luggage. The agency said that the chemicals used to cook methamphetamine are “extremely hazardous.” Some are highly volatile and may ignite or explode if mixed or stored improperly. Fire and explosion pose risks not only to the individuals producing the drug but also to anyone in the surrounding area, including children, neighbors, and passersby. Even when fire or explosion does not occur, methamphetamine production is dangerous. Simply being exposed to the toxic chemicals used to produce the drug poses a variety of health risks, including intoxication, dizziness, nausea, disorientation, lack of coordination, pulmonary edema, serious respiratory problems, severe chemical burns, and damage to internal organs. One York-Poquoson Sheriff’s deputy at the scene Thursday morning was taken to a hospital and treated for exposure to chemical fumes, though his condition was not life-threatening, police said. Data from the Drug Enforcement Administration shows that there are no other known clandestine meth laboratories in Poquoson or York counties. However, James City County police spokeswoman Stephanie Williams told the Daily Press that law enforcement officers were asked to search a home Thursday afternoon that was connected to the case involving the mobile meth lab. Local and state authorities as well as Tri-Rivers Drug Task Force assisted in the search in Toano, according to the newspaper. Williams did not confirm who lived there, but the York-Poquoson Sheriff’s Office said Copley, who was driving the van, lived on the same street. Williams told the Daily Press that authorities did not find any evidence at the residence. Authorities said that the investigation is ongoing and that additional arrests are pending.

At least 10 people were killed across the Southeastern U.S. as the devastating storm was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane and lumbered toward landfall just north of Charleston, near the town of McClellanville. The winds dropped to 75 mph, down from a recorded 145 mph at the height of the storm’s severity when it ripped across Haiti, killing nearly 900. Matthew whipped the coastlines of Georgia and South Carolina with torrential rain and stiff winds as its storm center blew ashore.

As the storm passed one city after another, the reaction was one of relief — that things were nowhere near as bad as many feared. “We are all blessed that Matthew stayed off our coast,” Florida Gov. Rick Scott said. “We are blessed that we didn’t have a direct hit.” The powerful hurricane killed at least four people in Florida and left more than 1 million homes and businesses without electricity. (PHELAN EBENHACK/REUTERS) At least five deaths in Florida and two in Georgia were attributed to the storm, and North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory said three people were killed in his state. Death tolls rises to over 800 in Haiti from Hurricane Matthew The Florida fatalities included an elderly couple in St. Lucie and two women killed in separate incidents as trees crushed their homes. “Now is the time for prayer,” South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said as the storm approached. Matthew was approaching Charleston early Saturday, where a curfew was in place between midnight and 6 a.m. (JONATHAN DRAKE/REUTERS) More than a million people were under evacuation orders in north Florida and Georgia’s coastal regions as roughly 300,000 people fled their homes in South Carolina. “We have been very fortunate that Matthews’s strongest winds have remained a short distance offshore of the Florida and Georgia coasts thus far, but this should not be a reason to let down our guard,” the Hurricane Center said in a forecast statement.

A disabled woman and her family were some of the many Savannah residents evacuated to Augusta before the deadly storm struck. (NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images) And the power began coming back on for the 1 million people in Florida who were in the dark for roughly 24 hours. Not eveyone was spared. The ravaging storm — the worst to threaten the Atlantic Seaboard in more than 10 years — killed at least 877 people in Haiti and left tens of thousands homeless.

(NICOLAS GARCIA/AFP/Getty Images) Many of the island nation’'s impoverished areas reported that cholera outbreaks were already claiming lives as the storm made its way north. Northern Floridan, Georgia and the Carolinas were still dealing with flood waters in many areas. St. Augustine, Fla., the nation’s oldest European settlement, was experiencing severe flooding that authorities said could exceed 8 feet Saturday. A 17th century Spanish fortress and other historic structures were in the water’s path. The massive storm was expected to severely flood several historic cities across the East Coast of the U.S. (JONATHAN DRAKE/REUTERS) “It’s a really serious devastating situation,” Mayor Nancy Shaver said. “The flooding is just going to get higher and higher and higher.” Steve Todd, who defied the mayor’s evacuation orders and stayed at his home in Tybee Island — one of the Georgia’s most eastern points — described seeing bushes fly by the windows of his third-story condo, where he hunkered down with friends. “I’m not regretting staying,” he said over the phone. “But I’m not going to lie: There’s a little bit of nervous tension right now.” Stacks of sandbags clogged the streets of Charleston, another historic town lined with colonial homes. Stores and shops in the downtown area had boarded up their windows with plywood and the usually bustling area was eerily quiet as the city announced a midnight to 6 a.m. curfew.

Corner Brook champs at chowing down on Chicken McNuggets With several fitness centres and endless hiking trails, Corner Brook could very well be the fittest place in the province — depending on who you ask. Chris Neal has been a personal trainer for 20 years in Corner Brook. (Colleen Connors/CBC) Forever Young Fitness Center is one of three gyms in a city of less than 20,000 people. Chris Neal has been a personal trainer there for almost 20 years. "I think considering the climate [and] the opportunities in Corner Brook, we could well vye for the fittest city in Newfoundland and Labrador," said Neal.  Is Corner Brook the fittest place in the province?0:59 Corner Brook also has a kickboxing studio, several yoga studios, a new CrossFit gym, aerobics classes, a running club and a biking club.  "But the options from indoors to outdoors stuff, we seem to have almost everything covered." - Heather Buckle If residents haven't joined a fitness club, there's also the Corner Brook Stream Trail, which is a popular spot for walkers year-round.  Stephan Mentore was one of many people who woke up before the crack of dawn to line up for a gym membership at 5 Wing Goose Bay. (Jacob Barker/CBC)   But is it fair to say Corner Brook is the fittest city, or does it just have a high concentration of athletic people who are into everything? And, is being fit enough? "I still see a lot of obesity when I am out and about. Especially at the malls. I don't think walking from Dominion to Walmart counts as going for a walk. I think the dietary aspects of healthy living are the biggest challenge for a lot of people in Corner Brook right now," Neal explained.  Happy Valley-Goose Bay only has one gym, with spots for 150 people, for a town of over 7,500. Richelle Weeks is the coach of the Trapper’s Running Club, which takes its training outdoors. (Jacob Barker/CBC) But Heather Buckle disagrees. Buckle opened a fitness studio and teaches pilates. She said the town has caught the fitness bug — and it's only growing. "Its a camaraderie thing. Everyone here uses it as a social thing," she said. "I love that it is that way. It's a beautiful, contagious bug." 1 gym, 1 line And if Corner Brook has an overabundance of gym options, Happy Valley-Goose Bay is most certainly on the opposite end of the spectrum — with just one gym for the entire town. Located on 5 Wing Goose Bay, the town's only gym offers just 150 memberships every three months. Otherwise, it costs $10 per visit. The Trapper's Running Club get outdoors in Happy Valley-Goose Bay to get some exercise. (Jacob Barker/CBC) Some arrive as early as 3:30 a.m. to ensure they snag a three-month membership. Long lines wrap out the door and around the building, long before the gym opens at 6 a.m. "We're all nuts to be here this early in the morning. It's the only way to get a membership b'y," Leo Drake said. "This is a good gym, the staff and everything is great, but just having to do this every three months is a little bit ludicrous, honestly." Gotta get up early to get a gym membership in Happy Valley Goose Bay1:10 "I came to Goose Bay for work and in my spare time work out," said Stephan Mentore, who's from Toronto. "I'm grateful that my employer doesn't mind me coming in a little late today — because I start early — and this gets in the way of work." Walk, run, ride Despite the lack of facilities, people in Goose Bay do find ways to stay fit. Walk Run Ride is an initiative put on by the town, challenging people to travel down every street between now and April.  "The busier people get, the less they get out and do physical activity, so this might just be a goal that will help people stay on course or get on course," said Dean Simon, who put the program together. People can track their progress by tracing the town's streets with a marker as they go.​ Wellness centre According to the town of Happy Valley-Goose Bay, there is an overwhelming need for a modern health facility, and said it does have a plan to build a wellness centre. The first phase of that project is to build fitness and aquatic sections, and eventually add an area for ice sports.  It expects the first phase will cost more than $20 million, and the province has committed $11 million toward it. The town said it is working to get funding from the federal government as well.   Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Weather Severe weather warnings or watches in effect for: St. John's Partly Cloudy 5°C Gander Partly Cloudy 3°C Deer Lake Partly Cloudy 4°C Channel-Port aux Basques 5°C Happy Valley-Goose Bay Light Snowshower -2°C More Weather Latest Nfld. & Labrador News Headlines Got sewer gas?

KG: By Email RSS Feeds: Smartphone Users Are Dialing in Mobile Payments for Convenience and Speed, According to yStats.com Report Germany-based research firm yStats.com has released a new report on the drivers and barriers to mobile payments. The publication Global Mobile Payment Methods: First Half 2016 also provides information on recent mobile payment innovations throughout the globe. Hamburg, Germany, October 08, 2016 --(PR.com)-- The highest value and numbers of usage of mobile payments is for online shopping, but the use of mobile payment in-store is growing; over a billion proximity mobile payment customers are expected globally in the next 3 years. Expansions and product launches leading this trend include Samsung Pay in Brazil, Android Pay in the UK and Walmart Pay in the USA. Still, surveys cited in the yStats.com report show that many shoppers are reluctant to use mobile payments because of concerns about security or simply not seeing an advantage to their use. The convenience and quickness of mobile payments seem to be the main positive features enjoyed by those who have made the move to their use, according to the yStats.com report. South Korea is one of the leading markets in penetration of mobile payments. Surveyed users there cited convenience as the main reason for use, with speed as a second motivation. In the USA and Western Europe mobile shoppers show a preference for even faster, one-click checkout by having their payment details saved. Press Contact: yStats.com GmbH & Co.

But a few retailers have really missed the mark and gone too far with their getups this season. Walmart and Amazon just pulled costumes, insultingly dubbed "Tranny Granny," from their online stores after being called out for peddling these transphobic ensembles. Just when you think some progress is being made, right? Last week a transgender child actor was featured in an episode of Modern Family, but this week it seems the world has gone backwards again with this poorly conceived costume.  If you're asking yourself, "What could these retailers possibly have been thinking?" You're not alone.   Walmart and Amazon pull #trannygranny costume. You think?! Marginalized identities aren&#39;t for you amusement.&mdash; Sarcastic Misathrope (@beeludwig) October 5, 2016 More from CafeMom: 10 Totally Inappropriate Halloween Costumes for Moms (PHOTOS) On what planet did @Walmart think it was a good idea to do a tranny granny costume? #thehighcost #oflowwages #fuckers #elistists #1percent&mdash; Joseph Aufenthie (@JAufenthie) October 5, 2016 In a statement made to LGBTQNation, Ravi Jariwala of Walmart Media Relations explained that the offensive costume came through a third party marketplace vendor.  "While it's listed on other sites, it clearly violates our policy and was quickly removed once we were notified," Jariwala told LGBTQNation. "We're appalled this seller put it on our site to begin with.” More from CafeMom: 25 Best Pregnancy Halloween Costumes The third party vendor, Rasta Imposta, has decided to rename the   costume -- which comes complete with dress, boob and butt pads, and a babushka -- "Manny Granny." A throwback name for an outfit that is far from novel ... and really just as awful. We love seeing original costumes and having a laugh at someone's genuine creativity. Halloween is meant to be a fun holiday -- especially for kids -- and bigotry really has no place in any of it.   Image via Walmart Read More controversial, in the news, halloween Share this Story Share Tweet Pin 2 comments Related Articles Good News Here's Some Good News From 2016 to Remind Us That It Wasn't All...

The shop is located in Papillion at the heavily trafficked intersection of 72nd and Giles in front of the Wal-Mart (8350 S. 71 Plaza, Suite 107). Widely acclaimed for being a popular neighborhood hangout, Potbelly features toasty warm sandwiches, hand-dipped milkshakes and live music, all making it “The Best Place for Lunch.” Papillion’s Potbelly Sandwich Shop marks the introduction of a drive-thru location to the area, making it even more convenient for loyal fans who are on the go. Potbelly shops have earned a reputation in communities coast-to-coast, for having delicious food, fun décor and fresh tunes. Craig Frantz, the managing owner of the new sandwich shop, is a Nebraska native with close community connections and an extensive background in business management and operations. “Opening the doors of our third Potbelly shop was a dream of ours that’s now a reality,” Craig said. “We can’t wait to become a community staple, a household name – the Frantz family loves being deeply rooted in the neighborhoods we serve.” Craig will run the business with his brother and business partner Kendall Frantz. Kendall will help manage the restaurant’s operations, focusing on hiring and training new staff, and working to develop the unique Potbelly culture. “All of our locations are operated with compassion and respect, two values Craig and myself take pride in,” Kendall said. “It’s always exciting to be able to build a team of bright individuals that reflect those values. Papillion is sure to love both our menu and service.” The newest Frantz’s Potbelly Sandwich Shop is in the process of hiring about 30 staff members including customer service staff and managers. It will be open from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, and 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. “We couldn’t be happier that Craig and Kendall have opened their third location in the Omaha-area,” said Rick Fossali, senior director of domestic franchising for Potbelly Sandwich Shop. “We’re excited to share our good vibes and delicious sandwiches with the Papillion community.” Potbelly Sandwich Shop first opened in Chicago in 1977, and now includes more than 350 shops across the United States. There are also 30-plus franchise shops in the United States and abroad. For additional information, visit www.potbelly.com.

The growing franchise has popularized a new snacking experience with customizable pizza and dessert options, all served in freshly-baked dough cones. Each snack cone is filled with high-quality ingredients inspired by original Italian recipes and baked in just three minutes in the brand’s proprietary oven. With existing locations in New Jersey, Texas, Florida, Philadelphia and South Carolina, Kono To-Go is expanding its footprint in shopping centers throughout California; Washington, D.C.; Texas and Idaho this holiday season. With more than 60 units in various stages of development, Kono USA’s To-Go model is perfectly suited for high traffic venues, bringing its innovative menu offerings directly to consumers in shopping malls, Wal-Mart stores, airports, festivals, sporting events and more. “We are providing consumers with a fresh, unique and convenient new alternative to the standard snack options you see in malls and other venues,” said Kono USA Co-Founder David Ragosa, noting that the brand’s new line of dessert cones developed in partnership with Ghirardelli will be a hot item this holiday season. The new mall locations set to open in November include: Baltimore, MD - Franchisee Tony Murphy is set to open Kono To-Go mall kiosks in Annapolis Mall and White Marsh Mall. A third unit is in the works.      Dallas, TX – Franchisee Frank Ovanessians is opening a Kono To-Go kiosk in Towne East Mall, his first location. San Diego, CA – Franchisee Larry Myers, who signed a deal for 10 locations, will open on outdoor mall kiosk at Mission Valley Mall. Boise, ID – Franchisee Tyler Blake is set to open the first of his three units in the Boise Town Center Mall. In addition, franchisee Robert Resendez, who signed a deal for five units, recently rolled out his first Kono cart to hungry crowds at a recent craft beer festival and rodeo in Houston, and earlier this year, the first in-line Wal-Mart location opened in Lancaster, South Carolina. Franchisee Eric Ciancaglini, who has operated a kiosk in the Cherry Hill Mall in New Jersey since November 2015 and a cart he has operated in over 20 events in 2016, has seen steady growth throughout the year. Ciancaglini is preparing for increased foot traffic during the height of the holiday season by increasing his staff and anticipates carrying the holiday momentum into the New Year when he will open his third location in the King of Prussia Mall.  Kono USA Co-Founder Carlo Ruggiero, added, “When hunger hits, consumers will no longer have to settle for salty pretzels or unfulfilling popcorn. Instead, Kono To-Go’s snack cones are providing the flavor, the variety and the novelty that mall shoppers have been craving for so long.” About Kono USA In 2013, entrepreneurs David Ragosa, Carlo Ruggiero, and Greg Kinlaw introduced the already popular European pizza-in-a-cone concept to America by establishing Kono USA and offering “The Original” Kono Pizza franchise opportunity. In 2015, the company expanded its portfolio to include Kono To-Go, reflecting diverse and portable product offerings of treats, eats and sweets in addition to pizza cones. All products are filled with fresh, quality ingredients inspired by original Italian recipes and baked in just three minutes in a proprietary oven. There are currently more than 60 “The Original” Kono Pizza or Kono To-Go locations operating or in various stages of development across the United States.

 Western Union is expanding its presence in Mexico BI Intelligence Oct. 7, 2016, 11:30 PM 881 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Here's how third-party integration could lift Stripe Here are the credit card networks you need to know Exploring the present and future of credit card processing This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Payments Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Legacy remittance provider Western Union will nearly double the size of its retail locations in Mexico through a new partnership that will bring Western Union services to many locations of OXXO, the country’s largest convenience store chain. Now, OXXO customers will be able to receive funds via a national hotline, in-store phones, or kiosks. As a result of the partnership, which could satisfy digital-savvy customers looking for technology-oriented ways to complete their transfers, Western Union’s network in Mexico will nearly double to 26,200 locations. This is part of what seems like an ongoing Western Union push to expand in Mexico.Western Union recently partnered with Walmart in Mexico to expand its retail pickup locations. This further expansion, which could help the company better reach a wider variety of customers in harder-to-access regions of the country, could bolster the remittance provider’s presence there. Mexico is the fourth-largest remittance recipient worldwide and the most popular destination from the US.  That means that growing its presence there could help Western Union increase its consumer-to-consumer revenue in the Latin America region, thereby growing a key segment of its business. In addition, a bolstered, digital-oriented presence in Mexico could help the remittance market leader remain its stronghold as digital-first providers like Remitly, Transferwise, and Xoom become bigger players in the Mexico space.  Every year, migrants send hundreds of billions of dollars worth of remittances back to friends and family in their home country. And there's a massive industry that facilitates these payments — and has for more than a century. The legacy remittance industry has been long dominated by cash, which requires physical locations where customers can hand over or pick up money. Building out those retail networks is a huge investment. It's left just a few players, called Money Transfer Operators (MTOs), controlling a bulk of the industry. But these companies' comfortable hold on the industry is now being challenged by digital remittance startups. Digital-first remittance companies are competing on fees and usability, and capitalizing on the way people's expectations have changed with the advent of digital and mobile channels. Evan Bakker, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on digital remittance that sizes the total remittance market, company-specific market share, digital's market share, and digital's growth at major remittance firms. It also assesses how disruptive digital startups have been by comparing their fees with market leaders, and by juxtaposing their business models with those of legacy companies. Here are some of the key takeaways: Digital's share of the global remittance industry is still fairly small at 6% — but growth is extremely fast at digital-first startups and legacy companies. Fourteen year-old Xoom makes more revenue from electronic channels than 75 year-old MoneyGram, the second-largest remittance company in the world. Startups are undercutting incumbents' fees in certain corridors; however, legacy firms have matched prices in many major corridors. Legacy firms' businesses are already responding to the threats posed by digital by lowering fees and adjusting business strategies. However, they face lower margins if they continue to compete with startups on pricing. In full, the report: Sizes the remittance market and calculates major remittance companies' market share. Estimates digital's share of the market vs. cash. Quantifies digital's impact at remittance startups and legacy firms. Breaks down the business models employed by each type of remittance company, and determines which ones are in a better position for growth. Compares transfer fees in various corridors to assess the competitiveness of each firm. Explores other platforms that could completely upend the industry from the outside.

Daily Edition Login to download John Oliver Takes on Donald Trump's Treatment of Alicia Machado 9:15 AM PDT 10/3/2016 by THR Staff FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Courtesy of POLITICAL HUMOR The 'Last Week Tonight' host said the presidential candidate had an "online meltdown" with his overnight Twitter spree on Friday. John Oliver devoted a few minutes of Sunday's Last Week Tonight to criticizing Donald Trump for his behavior in the wake of Monday's presidential debate, discussing how Trump was using online surveys to determine he won the debate against Hillary Clinton and highlighting his treatment of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. Oliver said that Trump really displayed his "winning temperament" by insisting he won when he didn't. “The clear problem with online polls is that you can vote anonymously as many times as you want,” said the Last Week Tonight host. He pointed out that it's how "Boaty McBoatface" won in a British "Name Our Ship" poll and how Pitbull ended up performing at an Alaskan Walmart. “Yet, Trump kept citing these nonsense polls," Oliver added. The host then turned to Trump's treatment of Machado, who he has continued to attack since Clinton brought her up at the debate. He characterized the flurry of tweets Trump sent early Friday morning, including calling for people to look at an alleged sex tape of Machado's, as an "online meltdown." "That is a candidate for President of the United States urging America to check out a sex tape,” said Oliver. “Just do me a favor, look up into the sky right now. Higher, no, higher still. Do you see that? Way up there? Way up above the clouds? That’s rock bottom. And we are currently way down here,” he said. Oliver then aired old footage of Trump and Machado doing an interview at the end of her reign, in which Trump asked people to vote on an online poll on whether a beauty pageant winner should be required to stay the same weight. "It seems you have a choice," said Oliver, addressing Trump. "Either admit unscientific polling is bullshit or that your views on women’s bodies are horrifying."

Fox 54 visited the shelters designated for self-evacuees to see how well they were holding up. Tybee Island resident Hope Barton said, "Being in a hurricane is not on your bucket list." That's an understatement. Barton and her husband drove down to Augusta and spent the night in a Walmart parking lot before making it to a warm shower and a place to lay their heads. Barton said, "The thought of living out of our car for a couple of days was challenging." Challenging for Barton, but ideal for Lyndon Hector. He decided that his car would be the perfect escape from the bustling activity in the Brigham Center as folks filtered in throughout the night. "I couldn't sleep in there because it was too loud," said Hector. Hector and his family had quite the journey from their Savannah home. He said, "We mainly spent our time at Butler High School. Since it was filled with so many people we were sleeping in the car. Then, we went to Trinity on the Hill. Around that time, they were filled with people. So, when we came here, there was plenty of room for us." Hector said noise and all, he's grateful for the experience and the hospitality that the volunteers have shown. Barton said, she couldn't agree more. "You just realize how everybody is the same. We all want to be safe. We all want to return to our homes, our families are all important to us. It just kind of hits you pretty strong when you're in this situation," said Barton. Augusta officials say shelters are still in need of the following items: -Board Games -Toys -Toiletries -Feminine Hygiene Products -Disposable Diapers -Premixed Baby Formula -Baby Wipes -Baby Food -Gallon Sized Ziploc Bags -Blankets If you would like to donate, you can drop the unopened items off at the Old Fire Station #7 located at 2163 Central Avenue in Augusta.

Published Oct 7th, 2016 5:39 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas One of the state’s biggest cheerleaders did his best to convince techies from around the country that Arkansas is a great place to grow a technology company. Gov. Asa Hutchinson spoke at the Northwest Arkansas Technology Summit in Rogers on Friday (Oct. 7). About 1,500 tech professionals attended the summit, more than double the number from last year. Hutchinson said Arkansas’ 3.9% unemployment rate and having the top GDP growth rate in the country in the first quarter of this year are two good reasons tech companies can locate and grow in the Natural State. He said Northwest Arkansas has become a technology center in part because Wal-Mart Stores and Tyson Foods couldn’t have become global companies without employing technology throughout their operations. Sam Dean, executive director for the Scott Family Amazeum, issued some challenges to the local community to focus on growing the local technology sector. Dean said Northwest Arkansas should become the densest, most concentrated STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) community in the country. Incorporating tomorrow’s workforce into the summit, more than 200 local high school students attended the summit from grants made by the Northwest Arkansas Council. Dean followed up asking the Northwest Arkansas business community to be supportive of STEM education and be willing to take calculated risks. Hutchinson said requiring coding be taught in every Arkansas high school had some risks. But two years into the program the biggest increase in students taking computer coding is among females and minorities, Hutchinson shared to a round of applause. Of the 65 speakers at this year’s Technology Summit, just 16.9% were women and 10% were minorities. ‘DIGITAL DISRUPTIONS’ The theme of this year’s conference was “digital disruptions” and Dr. John Cohn, an IBM Fellow, who is also known as the Mad Scientist, gave the crowd a sobering look at what life might look like in 2020 in a connected world run by the Internet of Things (IoT). Dr. John Cohn, IBM Fellow and “Mad Scientist,” spoke on the Internet of Things at the NWA Technology Summit in Rogers on Friday (Oct. 7). Cohn said as chips continue to get smaller and less expensive they will likely help hasten the IoT world. He said IBM is now working on a chip the width of two human hairs, is connected to the cloud and a fully functional computer, encripted with security and privacy and a radio. The cost is just 2 cents. Cohn said the applications for that are huge. “You are not going to be to able to buy a package of food at the store that is not chipped. As the price on this drops this technology is going to be incorporated into many more things. By 2020 scientist are predicting there will be 30 billion of these connected devices that relate to one another, right now there’s about 9 billion. This growth will represent $1.7 trillion in business values and tremendous opportunities,” Cohn said. By 2020 Cohn said there will be as many connected things gathered data together equal to the stars in the known galaxies. Cohn ran through what life might look like with IoT becomes more mainstream. He said imagine lying in bed with your wearables that check your comfort levels and track your health stats to ensure you have a good night’s sleep. The wearables tell the mattress to firm up for more support and you are awaken with a personal and calming message to great the new day. In the bathroom the toilet paper has been replenished because Kimberly Clark knows when you’re running low and automatically reorders. As you look into the mirror it checks your vital signs. As you go to the refrigerator, its notes that you chose the chocolate cake for breakfast, instead of the eggs. Knowing your health status, Cohn said, the refrigerator talks to your doctor who then cues up a prescription at the local pharmacy. “Think about your home watching over you. That is possible today. Next your self-driving car or shared ride through Uber picks you up for work, it knows you have prescription on file so it goes by the pharmacy first. You drive through, pay with your phone, never getting out of the car,” Cohn said. At work Cohn describes an office where robots work side-by-side with humans and he says the robot is starting to connect with his emotions. “After work my ride senses that I need to visit with my mom whose apartment is automated with IoT. Data collected by the IoT in her home have diagnosed symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease – technology available today. And oh by the way it also tells you that she’s dating again, something you might not want to know,” Cohn said. He said IoT will give consumer back time they spend doing some things. Shopping lists can be predicted by refrigerators or recorded by Amazon Echo. Shopping can be done online with scheduled delivery or picked up. He said Walmart’s Scan and Go and WalmartPay mean you don’t have to carry wallet in the stores today. Cohn said the connected world is happening and there’s no putting the genie back in the bottle. The challenge for businesses he said is to know when connectedness is too invasive and creepy. CREEPY OR CONVENIENT? Bill Akins, senior vice president of business innovation at Rockfish, quoting Karen Ann Terrell, Chief Technology Officer at Walmart, said “One person’s creepiness is another person’s convenience.” A frequent traveler, Akins said he signed up for the TSA automatic check-in option. He said it required a grueling background search and he had to give up some privacy to get that option, but it was worth it because he travels often and it’s a time saver. Earlier this year Akins was in Michigan when he contracted the flu. He went to the hospital there to seek a diagnosis. A couple of days later he opted to fly home early and tried to check in via the TSA automatic system. “I was denied check in because they told me I had the flu. I had to wait two more days before I could fly home. On the one hand as a passenger it’s a good thing that sick people can’t fly, but for me I realized quickly that I had given up a lot of my privacy in exchange for the automatic check-in privilege,” he shared. It was evident at the conference how technology is intertwined into every segment of life. sectors presenting at this year’s conference included: State government, health care, retail, supply chain, logistics, small businesses, hospitality, education and finance.

Hurricane Matthew stalls planes, plants, ports and trains Reuters 10/7/2016 Nick Carey and Meredith Davis © Wilfredo Lee/AP There are no lines to board flights at the Palm Beach International airport after flights in and out were cancelled in the afternoon as Hurricane Matthew advances, Thursday, Oct. 6, 2016, in West Palm Beach, Fla. Disruptions to air travel, manufacturing, supply chains and retail stores spread on Friday as Hurricane Matthew worked its way up Florida's Atlantic coast, leaving people and goods stranded and plants idled. After canceling 590 flights on Thursday, American Airlines Group Inc canceled 580 on Friday and 160 on Saturday. A spokesman said flights had resumed in Miami on Friday morning as the storm moved north. Quotes in the article Toyota Motor Corp TM ▲ 111.95 +1.09 +0.98% American Airlines Group Inc AAL ▲ 42.93 +0.63 +1.49% Delta Air Lines Inc DAL ▲ 46.38 +0.43 +0.94% Southwest Airlines Co LUV ▲ 43.84 +0.20 +0.46% Delta Air Lines Inc canceled 240 flights for Friday, and 80 for Saturday for northeastern Florida, coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Southwest Airlines Co canceled 130 flights for Friday and 95 for Saturday. United Airlines said it had canceled 270 flight from Wednesday through Saturday. The storm also caused railroads and retailers to suspend or curtail operations. Ports in Florida and up the coast, including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, also suspended operations. Toyota Motor Corp like several other automakers, holds new vehicles at ports prior to final shipment to dealerships. A Toyota spokesman said Friday the company moved most of its vehicles parked at the port in Jacksonville inland ahead of the storm. Nissan Motor Co Ltd said it had also moved some vehicles from the port prior to its closure and BMW accelerated deliveries inland. Wal-Mart Stores Inc closed a number of stores ahead of Hurricane Matthew, as did office supply retailer Staples Inc and Nike Inc, which closed facilities in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. Employee-owned supermarket chain Publix said stores in southern Florida had reopened after the hurricane passed. Manufacturers were also affected. Deere & Co closed its Miami, Florida, office and several of its Nortrax construction equipment dealerships around the state. "We basically want people to go home and take care of their own personal property," spokesman Ken Golden said. "For their safety we would rather have them doing whatever the government disaster officials are saying." Boeing Co suspended production on Wednesday at its South Carolina plant in North Charleston, and in Florida, including Miami, the Kennedy Space Center, Jacksonville and Orlando. The company was monitoring the situation at its Georgia and North Carolina facilities. Auto supplier WABCO Holdings Inc halted production in Charleston, South Charleston and said that "weather permitting," work would resume on Monday, Oct. 10. Business jet aircraft maker Gulfstream, a unit of General Dynamics Corp, said its plants in Savannah and Brunswick, Georgia, and West Palm Beach, Florida, were closed and should reopen on Monday. Engine maker Cummins Inc closed four plants in Florida, one in Georgia and another in South Carolina. Mining and construction equipment maker Caterpillar Inc temporarily shuttered facilities and offices in both Florida and South Carolina. Vulcan Materials Co closed facilities in the Bahamas and Miami, and all along the East Coast, spokesman Jimmy Fleming said. Vulcan's crushed stone is mixed with materials like concrete, cement and asphalt to repair roads and buildings. "We'll need to reopen (when possible) because we supply material to fix things," Fleming said. Honda Motor Co Ltd said Hurricane Matthew would not impact any of its manufacturing plants. "We are, however, monitoring any potential impacts to our supply chain," spokesman Chris Abbruzzese said.

Photo: Michael Short, Special To The Chronicle Buy this photo Race for East Bay state Senate District 9 gets tense in debate 1 / 3 Back to Gallery The race to represent state Senate District Nine — a swath of the East Bay that includes left-leaning cities Oakland, Berkeley and Richmond — grew tense during a recent League of Women Voters debate at Berkeley City College. The contenders, Nancy Skinner and Sandré Swanson, argued Saturday over the region’s housing crisis, the statewide drought, California’s chronically underfunded public schools, and what they both called a broken criminal justice system. They barely looked at each other and never shook hands. Veteran East Bay Democrats, Skinner and Swanson each served three terms in the Assembly representing districts that adjoin. Swanson, who lives in Alameda, now runs an Oakland foundation that funds job training and scholarships for black and Latino youths. Skinner, who lives in Berkeley, researches water issues and transportation at UC Davis. Skinner held a commanding lead over Swanson in the June primary and has raised much more money. As of September, she had nearly $1 million cash on hand, while Swanson had less than $40,000. She has touted herself as a reformer willing to compromise with other legislators to get things done. While in the Assembly from 2008 to 2014, Skinner passed bills to collect sales tax from out-of-state Internet retailers, clear the state’s backlog of untested rape kits, and prevent Juvenile Hall guards from disciplining young offenders with extended sentences. More Election 2016 Proposition E would set aside $19 million for SF street trees VP debate moderator dissed; UFW for Kamala Harris 4 challengers face off with incumbent west-side SF supervisor That big economic bubble Trump described — it’s not there By contrast, Swanson has cast himself as a fighter who sticks to his principles and isn’t afraid to go against his own party. During his term from 2006 to 2012, he passed bills to curb human trafficking, protect whistle-blowers and ensure freelance workers are given a contract in advance. Yet he has focused his campaign on his defiance of Democratic Party leadership. “We make a lot of promises,” Swanson said during the debate. “But when we have a record as legislators, you have to hold us accountable.” In 2009, Swanson opposed a carefully crafted budget deal by fellow Democrats. It cut social services, but closed a $41 billion deficit. The budget passed, but his vote cost Swanson the chairmanship of the Assembly Labor and Employment Committee. Skinner voted for that deal. She said Swanson’s dissent forced Democrats to court a Republican so there would be enough votes to pass the budget. “That required further compromises,” Skinner said. Swanson also opposed a successful 2011 bill to dismantle city redevelopment agencies that had steered property tax money into real estate projects in blighted neighborhoods. Throughout the debate, he chided Skinner for supporting the bill. She deflected his criticism, saying it was necessary to close the agencies. “Redevelopment took a portion of our property taxes that was otherwise used to fund our schools,” she said. “It was then utilized by many cities not to build affordable housing, but to build Walmarts and support football stadiums.” Swanson parried: “I understand budget games,” he said. “And I understand how politicians during the course of a campaign will say anything to people. But look at our voting records, and look at whether we were fighting for this community when it counted.” At the end of the debate, the candidates turned their backs on each other and left in different directions. Skinner and Swanson both have a track record of supporting labor, the environment and criminal justice reform. They agree on “90 percent of the issues,” Swanson told The Chronicle. But the two candidates come from different worlds. Swanson, 67, grew up in North Oakland, riding his Schwinn bicycle around Lake Temescal and seeing movies at the Paramount Theatre on Broadway. He began his political career as a student at Laney College working on the 1972 presidential campaign of Shirley Chisholm — the first black candidate to vie for a Democratic Party nomination. When Barbara Lee was elected to Congress in 1998, Swanson served as her district director and then as her chief of staff. He clinched an Assembly seat in 2006, representing much of the metropolitan East Bay until he was termed out in 2012. Skinner, 62, was the only UC Berkeley student to land a seat on the Berkeley City Council, which she won while pursuing a master’s degree in education. She later held high positions in environmental nonprofits and was appointed to the East Bay Regional Park District Board of Directors in 2006. She was termed out of the Assembly in 2014. Despite sharing many of the same values, the candidates differ sharply in style and approach. “Nancy is more the leadership candidate, and Sandré is more of a fighter and an outsider,” said Dan Lindheim, a lecturer at UC Berkeley’s Goldman School of Public Policy who is a friend of both Skinner and Swanson but supports Swanson. “I think Sandré is going to be more of a critical voice in the Legislature, and I think that’s important for the district,” Lindheim added. “If there’s a dead heat between their basic ideas, then I think the fact that he’s African American is an important tie break.” Skinner is white. Her supporters say she would be the more productive senator, in part because of her ability to work with others. District Nine runs from Rodeo down to San Leandro, and covers several moderate communities, along with others that are staunchly liberal. “She’s smart, and she’s good at coalition-building. And in a very diverse district, that’s what’s needed,” Contra Costa County Supervisor John Gioia said of Skinner. Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf echoed those sentiments, saying she endorsed Skinner because they share the same priorities and because Skinner has energy and grit. “As the mayor of Oakland, I really need an effective partner and advocate in Sacramento,” Schaaf said. With a month remaining until election day on Nov. 7, it’s not clear whether Swanson will be able to overcome Skinner’s apparent advantage in popularity and funding. They were the top two contenders in the June primary, where Skinner beat Swanson by more than 17 percentage points — 48 to 31 percent. Swanson has long embraced his underdog status. He told The Chronicle that counselors in the Oakland public schools mistakenly characterized him as an average student who would never attend college, and that he proved them wrong when he graduated from San Francisco State University with a degree in psychology. He said East Bay voters need someone like him to take principled stands that represent their views. “I’m proud to have lived in this district all my life,” Swanson said in his closing remarks at Berkeley City College. “And I’m proud to be part of a progressive agenda that will not compromise.” Rachel Swan is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Business owners in South Florida beaches took last minute preparations for Hurricane Matthew on Thursday while some people were spotted watching the waves. Fort Lauderdale beach　 Regulars out in force For Deborah Hiers, Hurricane Matthew means starting her weekend early. The Fort Lauderdale resident gathered with a group of friends Thursday morning at Spazio restaurant on the beach, where she is a regular. "We're out here enjoying the lovely weather," she said drinking Prosecco and eating an omelet. "Some of my friends are very concerned about it, but when you've lived down here for 15 years, this is nothing – a hurricane holiday."　 Hiers, 45, did take time to prepare her house, bringing in the garbage cans and furniture and closing her shutters, but "we're just waiting it out — there's nothing else to do," she said.　 South Florida hunkers down as Hurricane Matthew approaches the state. Pete Wood, 52, lives about 100 feet from the beach near The Westin Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort. His hurricane preparations included breakfast and drinks on the beach and a stop at the nearby Elbo Room.　 "It's funny, the beach people are the people who are the least worried," he said. "I'm only worried about the waves bringing sand onto the roads. I remember [Hurricane] Sandy brought piles of sand as high as the street lights. That's what I think we'll see here. Fortunately, we're south. I wouldn't be happy anywhere from West Palm Beach north."　 Interactive map: Supplies, shelters, damage reports and moreOpen link Carl Corso, 49, was thrilled to be at Fort Lauderdale beach on Thursday morning, bracing for his first hurricane experience. He caught the last flight out of Nassau, Bahamas, on Tuesday night, he said. 　 "I'd be panicking if I were stuck in Nassau," the New Jersey native said. "I'm worried if I'll even have a place left there." Corso owns a house in Nassau and one about a half-mile from the beach in Dania Beach. He said people in Nassau were laughing, not nervous and would joke that Hurricane Matthew "is like Christmas with plywood."　 Using a security-camera feed from Nassau, Corso has been keeping an eye on the storm on his iPad. He said the destruction has already begun.　 "I fear for everybody," he said. "The island definitely has no drainage, so they'll be flooded for sure."　 Like many people at Fort Lauderdale beach on Thursday morning, Andrew Cohen, 26, stopped to watch a group of kite surfers taking advantage of the waves created by Hurricane Matthew. 　 "The funny part is, we came out for groceries and ended up here," the Fort Lauderdale resident said while nursing a beer at the Elbo Room.　 - Emily Miller Medley Mobile Home Park Stocked up Arnaldo Current spent Thursday morning up drilling bolts on the roof of his trailer. Current, who has lived in the mobile home park just off Okeechobee Road since the 1980s, said he doesn't mess around whenever a hurricane passes near South Florida. "You never know if it deviates from its path and has a more direct impact on us," he said. He stocked up on food, water and gasoline and was taking all the furniture from his front porch inside his home. He also bought a radio and stored ice in a cooler in case the power goes out. After his home was battered by Hurricane Wilma in 2005, Current has remodeled his mobile home and hopes he won't have to deal with any damage or flooding this time. "I've reinforced the walls with wood and I feel pretty protected," he said. - Rebeca Piccardo Juno Beach Ready to ride it out Near the Juno Beach pier, lots of lookie-loos are visiting the beach before the storm. "This is my first one," said Kim Vona, 33, who moved from Syracuse, N.Y., to Palm Beach Gardens three years ago. "I'm not gonna lie, I'm a little nervous." Her boyfriend, Mike McIntire, 42, has been through four hurricanes. The last one was 10 years ago, and he said he feels "a little bit" out of practice "but I think we'll be OK." "Breakfast, beach, finalizing preparations, filled the bathtub, made sure we had enough ice" was how they spent their morning, McIntire said. How do they anticipate spending the rest of the day? "Hiding," Vona said. "Getting home and riding it out," McIntire said. - Tonya Alanez Fort Lauderdale Breakfast at the Floridian Fort Lauderdale professional photographer George Maznicki finished his hurricane preparations almost a week ago. 　 "I've been a resident of Fort Lauderdale and a survivor of hurricanes for the last 35 years," he said. "We've been prepared since pretty much Saturday. I haven't even been to a grocery store since Sunday afternoon." So, on Thursday morning, the 52-year-old headed downtown to Las Olas Boulevard to help local business owners board up their properties. "We've done at least three businesses so far," he said. "It's a little bit late, but better late than never." Across the street at the Floridian Restaurant, business was booming Thursday morning, with people sitting on the patio and packing the front room to capacity. "We're open until the city tells us to evacuate," the restaurant's owner Butch Samp said. Forty-year-old shutters covered the windows with the word "Open" sprawled across them. Samp, 70, said some of his employees didn't show up because of the storm, but he's going to keep serving customers as long as it's safe and he has power. - Emily Miller 　 Jupiter 'Dad says we're not leaving' After spending the morning taking down ceiling fans, dismantling flagpoles and securing the family's boats on lifts, Ellie Spivey, 17, of Tequesta, made an 11 a.m. visit to Juno Beach to catch a glimpse of the roiling sea. Her family has opted not to heed the area's strongly urged evacuation recommendations. "Dad says, 'no, we're not leaving,'" Spivey said. "So we're not leaving. It's kind of scary but we're ready." - Tonya Alanez Boca Raton Open for business Boards covered the windows at the 7-Eleven at Dixie Highway and Palmetto Park Road in Boca Raton, they're spray painted with the word "Open." Inside, store manager Shaf Zamon is still at work helping people grab last minute supplies. "It's slow in the morning. My employees don't want to come to work," he said. He estimates maybe one or two people per hour are coming in the store Thursday morning. Also coming in are vendors, who have been dropping off water. Zamon says the water was hard to find but he managed to find bottles that were imported from Scotland. Once the store closes at 1 p.m., he said he'll be heading to his home in West Boca near U.S. 441 to ride out the storm. After the hurricane passes and as soon as it's safe, he said he'll be back at the store selling supplies, he said. "Hopefully we can help out the people once the hurricane is done," Zaman said. - Adam Sacasa Hollywood If the power goes out, they'll head west Lindsay Anidjar walked her dog, Rafi, down her block at the Emerald Hills neighborhood in Hollywood on Thursday morning. "I took a look at the radar this morning and figured this was our last chance to take him for a walk," she said. This isn't Anidjar's first hurricane, but it will be the first for her children, ages 6, 4 and 2. "I was showing them the flashlights yesterday and they were shining it in their faces," Anidjar said. "I don't think they get that we could lose power." Anidjar's home has impact windows, making preparations less of a hassle, she said. Next door, Randi Perlman and her husband werbolting in their aluminum shutters on their windows. The couple has been living there since 1992 and are very concerned with the threat Hurricane Matthew poses. "We got good, water, cash and gasoline," she said. "Afterwards, we might leave." During Hurricane Wilma, they were left without power for several days and ended up driving to stay in a hotel in Georgia. If they lose power this time around, Perlman said they'd probable go west to the Naples area. - Rebeca Piccardo Fort Lauderdale Walmart: Shopping ground zero Scores of people stood in lines ‪Thursday morning‬ to buy food at the Walmart located at ‪2500 W. Broward Blvd. in Fort Lauderdale‬. Some said they were stocking up ahead of Hurricane Matthew others chatted about how they were here for routine shopping and didn't think the storm was a big deal. Third time was the charm for For Lauderdale resident Rachel Singer, who went to her neighborhood Walmart three times in less than 12 hours trying to get hurricane supplies. "Plenty of years before we would prepare for the hurricane and every year it wouldn't come, so we stopped," said Singer, who is 43 and has lived in Fort Lauderdale for 13 years. "This year, I decided to wait until the last minute because it never comes." But once she saw on the news the storm had passed over Cuba and was still headed toward South Florida, Singer decided it was time to stock up. "I came here at 8 last night, and there was nothing, then again at 10 and still nothing," she said. "This morning, I woke up at 6 a.m. to get stuff. I came here in the dark." Singer packed a shopping cart full of bread, foods to cook on the grill and paper products. But the store was still out of canned foods, water and propane gas, she said. Though Singer said she expects to lose electricity and is preparing for the storm, she is not entirely convinced her area will feel the effects of the hurricane. "We didn't board up our house yet completely because it could still turn," she said. - Emily Miller Boca Raton 'It's scary' Outside the Mi Casita Mexican restaurant in Boca Raton, Carlos Castillo, 29, and Ana Longinos, 26, both of Pompano Beach were putting sandbags up against the door. The restaurant's windows had already been boarded up with plywood. Castillo said he boarded up four homes in cities across Broward County on Wednesday and he's doing the same Thursday morning in Boca Raton, helping out friends and family. "We're taking it seriously. It's a big hurricane," he said. Like Castillo, this won't be the first major storm for Longinos. She said people should take this one very seriously. "Even if it's not hitting us directly, it's mother nature, you can't mess with her," Longinos said. Despite her previous experience, she's a little scared of what might happen, mostly because she was very young during the last major storm. "I was like yeah, a hurricane, whatever. Now when you're an adult, you take things more seriously," she said. "Especially when you have family, it's scary." Longino's sister lives east of Federal Highway in Boca Raton and will be evacuating and staying at Longino's home for the storm. Once the storm hits, Longino plans on watching movies and playing games with her young nieces as they wait it out. "[We'll] just wait and see what happens," Castillo said. - Adam Sacasa Pembroke Pines 'Starbucks' is the priority after gassing up At the Speedway store at 19600 Pines Boulevard, a dozen cars were lined up to get gas at 10:15 a.m. They'll have to fill up fast, the store's headquarters has ordered them to close by 11 a.m. Among the last minute folks were Nina Mendoza and Marty Mueller, a couple from Pembroke Pines. Also on their to do list: Bloody Mary mix, and the Starbucks. "We have to get Bloody Mary mix and then we're OK," Marty Mueller said. Asked about the order of priority, Mendoza said, "Starbucks!" - Linda Trischitta Boynton Beach Exercise before cabin fever sets is Their homes already shuttered and a hurricane on the way, Jennifer Kraatz, 43, and Mark Horning, 41, kept to their morning workout routine. The Boynton Beach residents usually meet each morning for a bike ride, but Thursday Horning biked solo while Kraatz went for a 3-mile run. There was no question to Horning that he'd be out on the roads before the storm. "I'll get cabin fever, so I'll get it out of my system while I can," he said. He and Kraatz agreed it was a nice morning for a workout. They bumped into each other on a street corner in Ocean Ridge and exchanged stories. "It's actually making my day," Horning said. "Nobody's on the road." - Samuel Howard Fort Lauderdale Use that electricity while you've got it Don Richards, 76, had a simple plan for the day, as he waited on Matthew: Use his electricity while he still has it. "I'm going to vacuum," he said. "I keep a really clean home." Richards owns a townhouse in Victoria Park and said he decided to walk his 8-year-old dog, Bandit, early Thursday before the weather got too bad. "I feel like I've done what I can, and now I'll just ride it out," he said. Though he lives in a voluntary evacuation area, Richards said he has no plans to flee his home. "I've lived here since 2004. I was actually here for [Hurricane] Wilma," he said. "A lot of people didn't think Wilma would be that much — well, it's kind of like this one. After Wilma, I had [glass doors] replaced with hurricane glass." A retired Navy captain and Cape Cod native, Richards said he grew up with hurricanes. "I'm very concerned that [Hurricane Matthew] continued to track west," he said. "It's not as fast-moving as Wilma was and that concerns me. I just hope for the best." To prepare for the storm, Richards moved his patio furniture inside, put up shutters and filled up his car's gas tank "Tempers were short I have to say, but I got my gas," he said. - Emily Miller Copyright © 2016, Sun Sentinel Hurricane Matthew Boca Raton 7-Eleven Hurricane Sandy (2012) All Sections News Sports Broward Palm Beach Entertainment Classified Obituaries 75°

This listing includes the most notable incidents for the reporting period and does not necessarily reflect all police activity. Editor’s note: All suspects are presumed to be innocent until proven guilty in a court of law, and values are estimated for stolen/damaged items. These are brief summaries of detailed BPD reports. Sept. 18 U.S. 64 (theft) Someone stole costly iteams from a man’s unlocked vehicle while it was parked on the 7900 block of U.S. 64 on Sept. 18, he reported to police the next day. He said the theft happened between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. When he returned he found his glove compartment open and objects strewn about the backseat. Items missing included a black Kodak camera ($500), a silver Sony camera ($100), a tripod ($30), a camera bag ($50) and a sim card ($20). U.S. 64 (auto burglary) A woman reported that someone broke into her 2010 Honda Civic while it was parked at Walmart (8400 U.S. 64). The incident happened between 2:30 p.m. Sept. 18 and about 6:10 p.m. The intruder broke the small passenger side front window to gain entry. Items taken included her black Trackfone cell phone, a Bank of America Visa credit card and several other unspecified personal items. Sept. 20 U.S. 64 (vandalism) Video surveillance captured a vandal in the Sam’s Club parking lot (8480 U.S. 64) on Sept. 20. A man reported that he left his vehicle in the lot around 10:50 a.m. When he returned, he saw a heavy key scratch mark stretching from the rear to the front on the driver’s side. The Sam’s Club supervisor said security video showed a male suspect exiting a silver or white Chevy truck, walking up to the victim’s truck. The suspect’s photo was taken as he exited the store. Bristol Park (theft) The manager of the Legends of Wolfchase Apartments (8840 Bristol Park) filed a report on Sept. 20 about an Aug. 5 crime. Someone stole a Poulan Pro blower ($250) from the facility’s maintenance building. Altruria (burglary) A couple’s alarm company alerted them on Sept. 20 that their home’s alarm was tripped at 1:01 p.m. Her husband looked at the live feed camera and didn’t see any movement, so he decided it must have been a false alarm. But when she got home around 3:30 p.m., she saw that the southern garage door was open and damaged to the point that it couldn’t be locked. Once inside, she saw that several kitchen drawers were open and her bedroom was in disarray. Items stolen included a Samsung tablet from her daughter’s room and two prescription bottles from her bedroom. Sept. 21 Brunswick (theft) The foreman of a home under construction on Brunswick reported on Sept. 21 that someone stole a new four-ton air conditioning unit from the back of the residence. He said the theft happened between 6:30 p.m. Sept. 20 and 8 a.m. Sept. 21. Sept. 22 Bartlett Boulevard (theft from motor vehicle) A woman visiting the playground at W.J. Freeman Park with her children on Sept. 22 was the victim of a car break-in. She said she arrived around 4:30 p.m. and noticed a black female in a gray vehicle of unknown make or model parked next to her. When she returned at 5:30 p.m., her purse was gone. Sept. 23 A.E. Beatty Drive (business burglary) The construction site foreman for Brimhalls (7472 A.E. Beatty Drive) reported on Sept. 23 that someone had stolen tools from the site. The theft happened between 5 p.m. Sept. 22 and 7 a.m. Sept. 23 when someone cut the padlocks on a storage container and removed several power/hand tools. Stage Road (auto burglary) A man who left his wallet in plain view in his car was the victim of a burglary on Sept. 23. The victim said he parked at 6418 Stage Road (City Park, behind City Hall) and placed his Louis Vuitton wallet on the center console while he jogged around the park between 8 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. When he returned, the passenger window was shattered but still in place, and the driver’s door was ajar. Germantown Road (theft from motor vehicle) A man noticed his car door was ajar when he left home around 7:20 a.m. on Sept. 23 for work. When he returned around 5:25 p.m., he realized that a medication bottle he keeps in the ashtray was empty. Other items missing included $2 in cash and an Oakley’s sunglasses case ($10). Sept. 24 Stage Road (robbery in progress) Suspects were gone when officers responded to a robbery call at Robert Irwin Jewelers (6025 Stage Road, Unit #38) on Sept. 24. Officers pieced together statements from witnesses and viewed video surveillance to confirm what happened. Around 5:35 p.m., an older model red Dodge Durango entered the parking lot at the Bartlett Boulevard entrance. A tall black male suspect (Suspect #1), about 25 years old, approached the business and knocked on the glass. He wore a black flat-billed hat, black hoodie and denim jean shorts. He opened the door and then turned right, toward the parked vehicle, and waved to the other suspects. Suspect #2, a tall light-skinned black male, about 21 years old, wore a gray hoodie scrunched on his face to where only his eyes, nose and mouth were visible. Suspect #3 was also a tall light-skinned black male about 21 years old, and he wore a gray T-shirt and had a backpack. Suspect #3 entered the store and pulled a sledgehammer out of the backpack. Employees ran out the back door as the suspects smashed in the glass display cases. Suspect #4 stayed in the car as the other three conducted the robbery. The robbers destroyed the glass in six display cases and took an unknown number of jewelry pieces before leaving. The vehicle left the parking lot and turned south on Bartlett Boulevard. Sept. 27 U.S. 64 (armed party) A caller alerted police around 3:30 p.m. Sept. 27 that two white males were pointing guns at each other in the parking lot of the Suburban Lodge (7380 U.S. 64). The caller said one went into a room and the other left in a gold Cadillac Silverado. A male and female victim told officers the suspects had threatened them in an argument over a vehicle. One suspect reportedly pulled out a black handgun and said he would kill them, but they were able to close the door to their room and keep him out. It was later determined that the suspect made the call to 911 from across the street using the victim’s phone. The male victim consented to a search of the room for any possible weapons and keys to the Chevy. Instead, officers found two used syringes, two digital scales with white residue on top, multiple small clear baggies, and several pieces of identification and insurance cards belonging to people not on scene at the time. The syringes had residue that tested positive for methamphetamine. A consent search of the male victim also revealed a roll of $750 in cash along with several more clear plastic baggies. He said the needles and scales were his. Officers began looking into the vehicle and noticed that the displayed tag was altered. The truck was unlocked, and officers noticed that the vehicle identification number (VIN) displayed on the driver’s door was taped on and altered. Officers found the proper VIN in the glove compartment. A computer check of the proper VIN revealed that the Chevrolet Silverado was stolen out of Huntingdon on Sept. 13. The officers arrested the male victim, and a search of his person related to the arrest turned up two baggies of methamphetamine with a gram total weight of 2.1 grams and two Adderall pills int he lining of the seam inside of the zipper to his shorts. Officers arrested the female victim and found the Chevrolet Silverado’s keys in her front left pants pocket. Sept. 28 Doberman Drive (theft) A man said on Sept. 28 that someone entered his home’s unlocked backdoor the previous day and took a weapon and cash. He said the suspect took a Ruger SR9 9mm handgun ($450) from his nightstand and a coin jar ($300) sometime between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. Share this: Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to Press This!

After cancelling 590 flights on Thursday, American Airlines Group Inc canceled 580 on Friday and 160 on Saturday. A spokesman said flights had resumed in Miami on Friday morning as the storm moved north. Delta Air Lines Inc canceled 240 flights for Friday, and 80 for Saturday for northeastern Florida, coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Southwest Airlines Co canceled 130 flights for Friday and 95 for Saturday. United Airlines said it had canceled 270 flight from Wednesday through Saturday. The storm also caused railroads and retailers to suspend or curtail operations. Ports in Florida and up the coast, including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, also suspended operations. Toyota Motor Corp like several other automakers, holds new vehicles at ports prior to final shipment to dealerships. A Toyota spokesman said Friday the company moved most of its vehicles parked at the port in Jacksonville inland ahead of the storm. Nissan Motor Co Ltd said it had also moved some vehicles from the port prior to its closure and BMW accelerated deliveries inland. Wal-Mart Stores Inc closed a number of stores ahead of Hurricane Matthew, as did office supply retailer Staples Inc and Nike Inc, which closed facilities in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. Employee-owned supermarket chain Publix said stores in southern Florida had reopened after the hurricane passed. Manufacturers were also affected. Deere & Co closed its Miami, Florida, office and several of its Nortrax construction equipment dealerships around the state. "We basically want people to go home and take care of their own personal property," spokesman Ken Golden said. "For their safety we would rather have them doing whatever the government disaster officials are saying." Boeing Co suspended production on Wednesday at its South Carolina plant in North Charleston, and in Florida, including Miami, the Kennedy Space Center, Jacksonville and Orlando. The company was monitoring the situation at its Georgia and North Carolina facilities. Auto supplier WABCO Holdings Inc halted production in Charleston, South Charleston and said that "weather permitting," work would resume on Monday, Oct. 10. Business jet aircraft maker Gulfstream, a unit of General Dynamics Corp, said its plants in Savannah and Brunswick, Georgia, and West Palm Beach, Florida, were closed and should reopen on Monday. Engine maker Cummins Inc closed four plants in Florida, one in Georgia and another in South Carolina. Mining and construction equipment maker Caterpillar Inc temporarily shuttered facilities and offices in both Florida and South Carolina. Vulcan Materials Co closed facilities in the Bahamas and Miami, and all along the East Coast, spokesman Jimmy Fleming said. Vulcan's crushed stone is mixed with materials like concrete, cement and asphalt to repair roads and buildings. "We'll need to reopen (when possible) because we supply material to fix things," Fleming said. Honda Motor Co Ltd said Hurricane Matthew would not impact any of its manufacturing plants. "We are, however, monitoring any potential impacts to our supply chain," spokesman Chris Abbruzzese said.

Daniels, 20, of Branchburg, allegedly bludgeoned his grandparents to death with an aluminum baseball bat on Feb. 13 while they were lying in bed. He has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the killings of Louis Simon, 78, and Beatrice Simon, 65, in the Branchburg home they shared with their grandson. Hours following the alleged murders, Simon-Daniels was arrested after making a 911 call at approximately 5:57 a.m. from the parking lot of a Hunterdon County WalMart. Readington Township police found Simon-Daniels in the driver's seat of a vehicle covered in blood. He was wearing a T-shirt and shorts, but no shoes, despite freezing temperatures, authorities said. Simon-Daniels, who is being held on $2 million bail, appeared relaxed as he entered the courtroom handcuffed Friday and slumped down as he sat in the defendant's chair beside his attorney, Todd Hess. He looked into the gallery at his mother, Erica Vavrence, and smiled. 8 major crimes in Somerset County Assistant prosecutor Robert Hawkes told the court that the state has completed discovery, but is waiting to address the psychological issues surrounding the case. He said he hasn't offered Simon-Daniels a plea deal because he wants to get the results of further psychological examinations before making an offer. Hess said Dr. Howard Gilman, a Ridgewood-based psychiatrist, has examined Simon-Daniels once in the jail and wants to evaluate him again. "Dr. Gilman is intrigued by the case and wants to see Ezra in the jail again," said Hess. State Superior Court Judge Robert B. Reed set Dec. 9 as the next court date. CORRECTION: In a previous version of this post, Eva Simon was incorrectly identified as Ezra Simon-Daniels' mother. Dave Hutchinson may be reached at dhutchinson@njadvancemedia.com.

To Ben & Jerry's By  Luke Winkie There is no question that Ben & Jerry’s is the most politically active ice cream company of all time. In the past, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield have supported The World Wildlife Fund’s “Fight For the Reef” campaign, Occupy Wall Street, and even the defense of Mumia Abu-Jamal. That already puts them in pretty rarefied company. There aren’t many Wal-Mart–stocked products with nuanced perspectives on black nationalism, and yesterday, they tweeted out a link to a lengthy manifesto, detailing their advocacy for the Black Lives Matter movement. ALSO: The Latest Ben & Jerry's Beer From New Belgium Is No Gimmick “Systemic and institutionalized racism are the defining civil rights and social justice issues of our time,” it reads. “We’ve come to understand that to be silent about the violence and threats to the lives and well-being of Black people is to be complicit in that violence and those threats.” You should read the statement in full, mostly because it’s interesting how thoroughly it avoids the gotta-hear-both-sides emptiness that tends to define every public take on the subject. As far as I know, Ben & Jerry’s are the only for-profit business in America who have come out in brazen support for Black Lives Matter. I don’t know if anyone was really jonesing for an ice cream brand to take a definitive stance on Black Lives Matter, but I’m glad they did. America is full of people who aren’t willing to engage in real questions about racism and privilege unless it’s forced on them. People love to dodge that conversation, and Ben & Jerry’s are making that more difficult. “We ask people to be open to understanding these issues, and not to reflexively retreat to our current beliefs,” concludes the statement. “Change happens when people are willing to listen and hear the struggles of their neighbor, putting aside preconceived notions and truly seeking to understand and grow. We’ll be working hard on that, and ask you to as well.” Add a Comment Sign Up for the Men's Journal Newsletter! Please enable javascript to sign up for the newsletter.

Over. He’s here. Goodbye. The mourning after More Opinion »   Being trained as an economist, it’s a little annoying to hear the rhetoric on both sides of the Measure 97 argument. There would be a little pass-through to consumers of the costs of the measure, but I say, “So what?” I don’t really care if the cost of toothpaste increases by 10 cents at Walmart. Some may counter by saying, “This would be regressive taxation,” but again, I say, “So what?” Having underfunded schools and social services is also regressive public policy. This may not be a perfect measure, but I’m voting for it because we desperately need the diversification and increase in public funding. Measures 5, 47 and 50 were hardly perfect and have devastated our state schools, and the sole beneficiaries of these measures were corporations. (Don’t even get me started on the stupidity of the kicker.) If passing this measure is a disaster, which I believe is completely unlikely, next year we can get rid of it along with getting rid of Measure 5.

The movie comes alive with its colors, characters and elegant, goofy execution — and above all, in its leading star Sasha Lane. In 2015, Lane was spending her spring break in Panama Beach when she was discovered by director Andrea Arnold. An 18-year-old with no prior acting experience, Lane was cast on the spot. The result is a genuine lead performance. Her character, Star, is introduced rummaging through some Midwestern dumpster, grabbing dinner for herself and the children under her care. Arnold’s approach here — in the opening shots of a 162-minute marvel — is minimally explained, with no context as to the children’s care or the disadvantages that have led to their forced bond but extremely telling. Star is continually moving ahead, while her thoughts are clearly anywhere but her home. In a Wal-Mart parking lot, Star finds Jake, portrayed by Shia LaBeouf, alongside his massive troupe of outcasts, stoners and weirdos belonging to a tightly-run “mag crew.” These “crews,” inspired by real-life The New York Times reporting, are a boozed-out pyramid scheme on wheels, driving door-to-door through flyover country, selling off magazine subscriptions and moving to the next town. Star leaves with the group for Kansas City without a thought, and the movie takes that massive leap as almost a credo, a code of reference. Everything that happens in American Honey feels improvised — the only thing more remarkable is that it actually was. Photo courtesy of A24 All-American rejects · Andrea Arnold’s film American Honey won the Jury Prize at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. The drama features a mix of “street-casted” actors, including Sasha Lane (above), who made her acting debut as Star, and Shia LaBeouf, who plays the role of Jake. Writer-director Arnold — famed for 2009’s similarly raw, Oscar-winning short film Fish Tank — is obsessed with improvised interactions between young people on society’s fringes and achieved this by actually making up her films on a week-by-week basis. Arnold’s actors, though largely non-professional, seem to be as energized by discovering themselves as we are to discover them, which plays unbelievably well off of the absurdly famous LaBeouf’s pack leader. The actor’s wild-card reputation, while irritatingly well-documented by now, has imbued his movies with a near-animalistic energy for a few years now, and it would seem to have a newer sophistication in American Honey. The push-and-pull between Star and Jake — playing out in agonizingly patient timing, in some of the most beautifully amber-tinted images of the year — is quirky, achingly romantic and troubling in equal measure. It’s a star-crossed romance filmed in a local backyard. The sense of location is stunning: marrying its loose-leaf story to extremely focused, telling portraits of the smallest details — the way a sunset looks in Kansas City, flies circling around trailers, Monster cans laying around Dakota motels. This is not a movie concerned with message or morals. It’s much too busy building its youthful energy in real-time, with Star’s path to some odd sense of adulthood landing the movie the gorgeous conclusion. Watching American Honey is like going on the most meaningful, dream-like road-trip with the craziest friend. Even better, it is the rarest and most elusive breed of movie, one that seems to operate on every one of the senses in ways no one understands. It’s perfect, rare and totally American.

After cancelling 590 flights on Thursday, American Airlines Group Inc canceled 580 on Friday and 160 on Saturday. A spokesman said flights had resumed in Miami on Friday morning as the storm moved north. Delta Air Lines Inc canceled 240 flights for Friday, and roughly 80 for Saturday for northeastern Florida, coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Southwest Airlines Co canceled 130 flights for Friday and 95 for Saturday. United Airlines raised its total number of cancellations for Wednesday through Saturday to 270 from 180. Many of the additional cancellations affect Georgia and South Carolina. The storm also caused railroads and retailers to suspend or curtail operations. Ports in Florida and up the coast, including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, also suspended operations. Wal-Mart Stores Inc closed a number of stores ahead of Hurricane Matthew. A spokesperson said the company was using its experience of past disasters to anticipate what goods may be in greater demand after the storm passes. Office supply retailer Staples Inc said it had closed stores in line with emergency evacuation guidelines. Nike Inc has closed facilities in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina and encouraged "employees to follow the guidance of state and local officials to evacuate areas." Online retailer Amazon said it was working closely with its employees to ensure their safety and get donations of supplies to areas hit by the storm. Employee-owned supermarket chain Publix said stores in southern Florida had reopened after the hurricane passed. Manufacturers were also affected. Deere & Co closed its Miami, Florida, office for three to four days and several of its Nortrax construction equipment dealerships around the state. "We basically want people to go home and take care of their own personal property," spokesman Ken Golden said. "For their safety we would rather have them doing whatever the government disaster officials are saying."

(WIAT) — Rumors are flying on social media, warning that the Walmart on 280 in Sylacauga will be shut down by a Black Lives Matter protest. The rumors also include the Black Panthers, with suggestions that motorcycle clubs and the KKK are showing up to counter protest. CBS42 has received numerous questions from citizens about these rumors. One of the rumors even cited a business owner who alleged that police contacted his business and said BLM and the Black Panthers were shutting down 280. We spoke to Sylacauga police, who told us in no uncertain terms that these claims are not credible, and they have not called any business owners. They said they have received about 50 calls about the rumors. “No credible threats of civil unrest. No credible threats of protesting. The Alabama Fusion Center is monitoring social media for anything credible. The police department has made preparations if something pops up,” Sylacauga Police Chief Kellie Johnson said. However, there is a motorcycle ride planned to benefit Sylacauga teen Brian Ogle this evening at 6 p.m. that will begin at the Walmart. Organizers will be taking donations to help with medical bills.

After cancelling 590 flights on Thursday, American Airlines Group Inc canceled 580 on Friday and 160 on Saturday. A spokesman said flights had resumed in Miami on Friday morning as the storm moved north. Delta Air Lines Inc canceled 240 flights for Friday, and roughly 80 for Saturday for northeastern Florida, coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Southwest Airlines Co canceled 130 flights for Friday and 95 for Saturday. United Airlines raised its total number of cancellations for Wednesday through Saturday to 270 from 180. Many of the additional cancellations affect Georgia and South Carolina. The storm also caused railroads and retailers to suspend or curtail operations. Ports in Florida and up the coast, including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, also suspended operations. Wal-Mart Stores Inc closed a number of stores ahead of Hurricane Matthew. A spokesperson said the company was using its experience of past disasters to anticipate what goods may be in greater demand after the storm passes. Office supply retailer Staples Inc said it had closed stores in line with emergency evacuation guidelines. Nike Inc has closed facilities in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina and encouraged "employees to follow the guidance of state and local officials to evacuate areas." Online retailer Amazon said it was working closely with its employees to ensure their safety and get donations of supplies to areas hit by the storm. Employee-owned supermarket chain Publix said stores in southern Florida had reopened after the hurricane passed. Manufacturers were also affected. Deere & Co closed its Miami, Florida, office for three to four days and several of its Nortrax construction equipment dealerships around the state. "We basically want people to go home and take care of their own personal property," spokesman Ken Golden said. "For their safety we would rather have them doing whatever the government disaster officials are saying." Boeing Co suspended production on Wednesday at its South Carolina plant in North Charleston, and in Florida, including Miami, the Kennedy Space Center, Jacksonville and Orlando. The company said it was monitoring the situation for its operations in Georgia and North Carolina. Auto supplier WABCO Holdings Inc halted production in Charleston, South Charleston and said that "weather permitting," work would resume on Monday, Oct. 10. Business jet aircraft maker Gulfstream, a unit of General Dynamics Corp, said its plants in Savannah and Brunswick, Georgia, and West Palm Beach, Florida, were closed and were tentatively slated to reopen on Monday. Engine maker Cummins Inc has closed four plants in Florida, one in Georgia and another in South Carolina. Honda Motor Co Ltd, which has a plant in South Carolina, is evaluating the impact of Hurricane Matthew. "At this point, the hurricane will not impact any of our manufacturing plants," spokesman Chris Abbruzzese said. "We are, however, monitoring any potential impacts to our supply chain."

"We are, however, monitoring any potential impacts to our supply chain." Fitch Ratings estimates that if Matthew results in insured losses in excess of $10 billion, a greater proportion of losses will be borne by reinsurers as opposed to primary companies. CoreLogic, a California-based real estate data firm, estimated the storm could cause up to $189 billion in storm surge damage to residential property in Florida alone. In comparison, recovery costs from Superstorm Sandy totaled $71.3 billion in New York and New Jersey in 2012, according to estimates from their governors. Here is a summary of closures and disruptions due to the hurricane. TRANSPORTATION AIRPORTS: South Florida airports closed. Flights at Miami International Airport were resuming on Friday.

(WBAY) — Across the country there has been an increase and spread of bed bugs. A two-and-a-half year old rescue dog is working with the Brown County Health Department and showing off its unique job to help fight the problem. Chester the dog is one of just a few dogs in the state trained to sniff out bed bugs. “Chester will do a full search of the area. He’ll get his nose in every little nook and cranny,” said Jon Sandberg, Sandberg K9 Solutions. RELATED COVERAGE: Man bitten by bed bugs on Walmart scooter “Up until about 10 years ago bed bugs in Wisconsin were basically unknown,” Marty Adams, Brown County public health sanitarian, said. “Just in this area we’ve seen a 300 percent increase just in bed bug treatments over the last two years,” Sandberg said. “We’ve done hundreds of searches this year.” “As more and more homes, hotels, public facilities get them, the demand for a dog with this service is increasing,” said Adams. “If we didn’t have such a demand now Chester and I wouldn’t be here,” Sandberg said. The bigger problem is that bed bugs don’t just appear in beds. “Residential, property management, hotels, schools, movie theaters, transportation,” said Sandberg. “It’s getting to that point where it’s bad enough that people have to start educating themselves and becoming aware of the situation that’s in Green Bay.” That’s why this year, Chester and the Brown County Health Department will be doing just that at their first public health fair. The department will show people all they have to offer from 9 a.m. to noon at Shopko Hall on October 15. “A big part of this is showing the community what we are and what we can do,” said Anna Destree, of the Brown County Health Department.
